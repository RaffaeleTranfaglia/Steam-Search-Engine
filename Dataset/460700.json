I enjoyed every second of it and never felt bored or rushed to finished, I was totally fine with backtracking and revisiting places to get secrets and such (Which is rare for me). I have no complaints I enjoyed this more then any other single player game I can remember in the past five years. This game really just hit all my checklists, I kept thinking it would be cool if you could do this... welp you can. Great game, thanks for the experience.",

            "review_text": "Great Metroidvania style game with a big twist - it's all set underwater!  Plenty big map to explore with lots of nook and crannies to check out for treasure. Lovely graphics and a great setting really help suck you into the undersea world and a charming story helps things along while not getting in the way. No shortage of puzzles either, but they are easy enough to figure out and shouldn't prove to be too frustrating.  Combat isn't amazing but it is certainly passable - you can buy upgrades (find some too, of course) and hunt down fragments to enlarge your 'HP' and 'Mana' bars, classic! Several boss fights help to add some pizzazz.  If you love Metroidvania games, this is a solid buy!",

            "review_text": " Song of the Deep  by Insomniac Games let me left with mixed feelings after I had finished playing through the Game so far.  Technical issues left and right while you play through the Game will let you wonder why the Game wasn`t delayed at least till the end of summer to have at least a Build that could be called  Read to ship  instead  The ship is still sinking but we are still on course .  On the one hand we have a real well worked out Storyline, Soundtrack, Mission Design that I enjoyed from the Beginning till the end and on the other hand we have a Video Game that clearly does have a couple of Technical Issues that weren`t fixed till today.  Usually I`m someone who can accept that since creating a Video Game isn`t easy and Bugs/Glitches and other issue are a common thing but in a Video Game were the Developer does even recommand that you use a Controller instead of an Keyboard that two of the most commen used Controller on Steam (Steam Controller &amp; Xbox (One) (Elite) Controller) are still having issues while on the Store Page the Game is still marked as   Full Controller Support  this is at no point acceptable.  Since Day One the Update Notes clearly indicated that the Game was rushed out and since then those issues being patched and fixed where someone else would already get asked of how it could have been that the Game was launched at all in such a form.  Don´t get me wrong:   Song of the Deep  isn`t a bad Game at all and it`s clear to me that the Art and the Level Design of the Game is very unique and enjoyable but since I am rating Games on their current form and not what they might be in a couple of months/years I clearly have to warn everyone ahead of buying the Game before so they know very well what they will get in return.

I am so glad that I was allowed to try this game.  8 plus hours in Story is complete but still so much more to collect. Has that metriod vibe where you explore and find upgrades that makes your life easier or gain access to other parts of the game.   Music is amazing, fits perfect its calm and enchanting.  Story kept me pulled in, I needed to know what was happening in this world and I cared. Maybe its being a father myself is why I cared so much. But loved it all the way through.   Gameplay is a lot of fun, at no point did it feel like a drag, I knew where I needed to go but many times I would just float my own way in search of treasures or new parts for my ship.   In short I am so glad this game discovered me. Well spent gaming time.",

            "review_text": "  I thought this was going to be a slow paced puzzle style game and that had me not very interested in it. Then I heard it was going to be a Metroidvania style game and that got me interested again, and it did not disappoint.  While there are certainly plenty of puzzles, some with interesting solutions and quick reflexes needed it also had a great balance of action and the exploration you would expect from a Metroid style game.  This was a great experience from beginning to end and I enjoyed it so much I finished the thing in 3 days which is a big deal for me since I don't have a ton of time to play games. I just couldn't put it down. My ONLY disappointment was the final boss battle which was a little lame considering all the buildup, but I won't spoil it for you.  I want to touch on the controls for a little bit since they seem to be the most controversial topic surrounding the game. I have read reviews where people have had so much trouble with them that they couldn't continue the game and while I'm sure those criticisms struck home with them, I personally don't see it. I thought the controls were near flawless and part of the reason it took me over 15 hours to beat the game was due to the fact that I had so much fun just navigating my sub throughout the water. A lot of the puzzles involve precise movements and I had no trouble with these and on the last level of the game you have to navigate between giant lasers and I was bobbing and weaving my sub between the beams with no trouble at all and it was a blast.  I certainly recommend playing it before writing it off for the controls as there are mixed messages all over concerning them. Just play it for yourself.",

I personally think the art style is one of the best out there, and the story could be written as a book. I haven't experiecend that many bugs, but there certaintly are some annoying parts. While I was fighting the Watcher, I kept on getting messed up with the camera view, since it kept going in and out. I think that is my biggest problem in the game, which is the camera angle. It keeps on going in and out, and it gets really confusing. Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10, or 3.5/5. The pros outnumber the cons greatly, and it really is a good experience",

            "review_text": "Song of the Deep is a short and sweet Metroidvania game. Not a masterpiece, but it'll certainly scratch that exploration and puzzle solving itch.  Graphics: 9/10. A good, pleasing graphical style that still manages to be clear and easy to read. It's not perfect, but it is very good.  Sound Effects: 5/10. Pretty standard sounds, overall.  Voice Acting: 10/10. The voice acting was perfect. The narrator had a 'storybook' vibe that fits the game perfectly, and on the occasions when other character talk, their voices are pretty much perfect as well.  Music: 8/10. Pleasant music for an underwater adventure.  Gameplay (Combat): 7/10. The combat towards the end winds up being less interesting than towards the beginning, but most of the bosses are fun and interesting, and the core combat mechanics are solid.  Gameplay (Puzzles): 8/10. The puzzles are fun and interesting... mostly. However, you'll learn to hate explosives by the end of the game.  Gameplay (Exploration): 9/10. The world is well designed and fun to explore. While some secrets are easy to miss by eye, the map automatically marks treasures and upgrades, making going back for them easy once you have the right equipment. Additionally, a certain late-game item makes going back for loot you've missed a much less frustrating experience, which I was extremely grateful for.  Story: 8/10. A simple, but pleasant, story-book-esque story. Who says fairy tales are only for kids?  Overall: 64/80 (80%). Despite a few imperfections, I would definitely recommend this game.",

Movement mechanics are good enough that you do feel underwater, but they're responsive enough so that you don't have to fight the game, only your enemies. Monsters each have their own weakness, and for the most part all their attacks are dodgeable. I really enjoy how each step along the way you get new items that are immediately useful - There are no pointless upgrades!   Another great thing is the environment. Everything is very crisp and colorful. No matter where you go, it's always beautiful and unique.  I would have liked to see there be some visual changes when you buy submarine upgrades, though. One of my favorite part of Ratchet and Clank was see my weapon visably get stronger, and that didn't happen here.   Overall well done! I got it on sale for $10, which is what I think the normal price should be. No matter how much I enjoy a game, I think that with an 8 hour story and little replay value it just doesn't quite warrant a $15 price tag.",

            "review_text": "If I would have written this review a few weeks ago, I would have been on the fence, but after this last update I'm definitely one sided, this game is amazing!   The only issue I had was playing with mouse and keyboard it was very difficult to accurately aim, as there was no way (or than the orientation of the sub) to tell where you were going to shoot or aim things. The latest updated added crosshairs and better mouse control, which made a good game a really great game!   The graphics are great, their choice of color palette is really wonderful, some areas are dark and forboding while others are bright and alive, and the sense of danger or calm is very well conveyed! With the addition of crosshairs for mouse movement, the movement is really solid. The world is massive and as you improve your weapons and submarine with new items you find, you'll want to go back to other areas to see what you might have missed or where you can go that you couldn't before. Best yet is that, unlike some other games, going back to other areas doesn't feel like a chore (just grinding to get it all), there's puzzles and traps and items that really make unlocking each new weapon or area feel like an adventure.  At $15 this game is actually pretty cheap, for the quality and amount of time needed to explore everything (especially if you're hunting down every treasure), you really can't go wrong!",

            "review_text": "I usually like what Insomniac puts out, which makes it a shame that this game isn't very good.  The controls and combat feel very sloppy. Trying to dodge enemy attacks is aggravating and pointless with the awkward controls and physics of your submarine. It almost feels like the developers knew the controls weren't very good, as enemies do very little damage and drop plenty of health and ammo upon death. So despite it being almost impossible to avoid damage, you can faceroll through most enemy encounters. Ultimately this makes combat feel boring, since it's mostly just wildly shooting torpedos at enemies while you get rocked by dozens of attacks that don't threaten you. There's also not much enemy variety, you'll get sick of jellyfish and the same mine-throwing miniboss very quickly.  More important than combat, exploration and character progression are at the heart of a Metroid-style game, sadly they dropped the ball on this as well. Most of the upgrades tend to be the 'key and door' style upgrades, where an upgrade only has one or two specific instances where its useful, and isn't even worth considering otherwise. Upgrade usage is mostly banal, using the ice torpedo to open a fire door, or using searchlights to move jellyfish. Exploration suffers because of this, it feels like going through a string of arbitrarily locked doors rather than naturally progressing through a world. It doesn't help that there's not much to find besides money, which only lets you buy (mostly passive) upgrades to your ship that don't add much. There's a few puzzles, but they're barely worth mentioning. Basic physics puzzles, using bombs to blow up doors, and using mirrors to redirect laser beams are the name of the game.  To top it off the game doesn't seem very well made. One of the few notable upgrades lets your character leave the submarine to explore smaller passages. Some of these smaller passages look just big enough for your sub to squeeze through. If you try going though at a high enough speed, your sub will make it through but won't be able to make it back out, forcing a restart. One area changes its layout dynamically as you progress, but it automatically changed itself into something that there was no way to possibly get through it, forcing another restart so it could change itself to the 'proper' layout. At one point your submarine seemingly gets destroyed and your character has to go on her own for a bit, unless you hold the button that lets you automatically return to your submarine, then you'll just skip over the entire section to your newly repaired submarine. Song of the Deep also runs on the Unity engine, which means it stressed my computer about as much as a modern AAA game, despite being much less graphically intensive.  It's not all bad. The story is pleasant enough and has some decent illustrations thrown throughout. It looks nice for a $15 game despite the aforementioned Unity problems. But I can't really recommend it unless you've already gone through every game in this very specific niche of Metroid-style game and are desperate for more.",

I have one WHQL monitor in the center and one 1920 monitor on each side in portrait mode. Obviously I don't want to play the game in portrait mode. Only workaround is to use my display configuration tool and turn off other two monitors. Out of 100+ games that I own this has never been a problem before ever. Okay, so now I have only 1 monitor, and SOTD launches but now the game is stuck in portrait mode with no way of changing it. When I go into the 'options' menu it is now stuck in 'audio' settings. I did see the 'video' settings once when it ran on the side monitor but cannot get there from the menus any more. I clicked on each audio option in turn and turned them all off, but now I cannot turn them back on. It ignores my mouse clicks and I've also tried using the enter key, the numpad enter key, and the space bar to no avail. Now I cannot get into the 'video' menu or any menu within 'options' other than the audio menu. I cannot get the game into normal landscape mode. I cannot reenable any of the audio settings. I cannot play this game. I need to get my money back. Hope you fix it soon. Maybe you shouldve tested a lot more before releasing it. :( I cannot give a good review at this time. Maybe later it these issues are addressed.",

The freeze bombs make the actual bombs float.   . They did not make that obvious or explain that in any way.  Another BIG issue is that. It will run with no framelimit EVERY TIME you open it up. You have to go into options and manually apply the 60FPS limit EVERY TIME. At first I thought the game was not optomized properly(EDIT: it isn't) because the FPS overlay WOULD NOT show up. But now it does since they patched it today(probably the reason but I can't be sure) and now I see that it was running at 100FPS the whole time even though when I first started the game I set it at 60 so I opened up the menu, hit apply on the graphics setting and now it is capped at 60 again. Close the game, start up, have to do that all over again.  The final issue is that at certain points it MAXES OUT my graphics card even at 60FPS. I have GTX 670 so not that impressive but it runs the witcher 2 no problem at almoast maxed out settings. This game does not look anywhere near as good. The witcher 2 does not max out my GPU.

The floaty controls feel a bit less floaty when you speed up your submarine but navigating always feel like a a chore, there are some really annoying light puzzles, weight puzzles that involve physics and giant rocks. The game is easy, I sunk the final boss in less than 5 minutes.
