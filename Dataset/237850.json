I love these games with all my heart- favorite series of all time- but I found myself a bit bored at times in chapters 1-3. Do NOT let this discourage you. In chapter 4, I felt all the flood of emotions from Dreamfall flood back and wrench my heart. Chapter 4 alone makes this game entirely worth playing, along with the in-depth characters, originality, and beauty throughout the entire game. I cried several times. Also, the decisions I've made warrant another playthrough in hopes that mistakes will be fixed. In Telltale games, it appears to me that the game is decided no matter what choice you make because your choices never affect the NEXT chapter. Not so will Dreamfall: Chapters. Each decision you make will have an impact on future gameplay. I cannot wait for chapter 5 to see what I will regret and cry over next.",

The characters are so poorly written that you would be better off just reading TLJ fanfiction. Save the money and the time.   --------------------------------------------- Original review at the end of book one:  Very mixed feelings on this one.  + Very pretty at times + Music and visuals fit together nicely (atmospheric) [+ Dialogue can be very frank and natural] Update: Nevermind, even this becomes terrible later on. + Interesting dream world (but very little of it) + Promising choice system (One my choices was picked only by 1.9% of players. A different choice that was seemingly cosmetic changed my character's career.)  - Overtly and self-righteously political (I sincerely hope there is a plot twist coming and it seems like it really might be, because thus far it felt more like really bad propaganda than a political commentary [or a game about dreams for that matter!]. It's two-dimensional, militant and above all unpleasant. There is no middle ground.) - Terrible performance on modern hardware (main hub) - Nothing of essence happens in Part 1 (even the cliffhanger is a little dull) - Dialogue can be really bad and both the main character and her boyfriend sound like incredibly pretentious holier-than-thou types  Maybe it would be better to wait for more parts to come out. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't spoil anything because nothing really happened.",

            "review_text": "An absolute must-play if you played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey before.   At first I played a slightly different version of Book 1, which had some different game mechanics as the current version but I enjoyed it very much. I'm someone who gets attached to characters, especially (or maybe I should say only) when they are well-written, and have complex personalities. So of course, TLJ and Dreamfall:TLJ had me completely hooked on the story of April and Zoe. I remember very vividly being 16 (8 years ago) and    being completely heartbroken after April had died, and utterly frustrated that I was left with so many questions about the White Dragon, and the 'Undreaming'.     So yes, I became emotionally attached to the characters, and hoped that Dreamfall Chapters would live up to my expectations and be able to answer all the questions while still coming up with a great story. And they absolutely did! The story has fantastic new characters, well-written and likeable (and hateable), while still doing a great job of weaving in old characters, or other familiar things from previous games. That, in spite of some issues which I'll adress later, made the game special to me and made me feel at home in the Dreamfall Chapters universe.  Purely looking from a game mechanics point of view, I agree with several reviewers that there is a lack of good, intuitive puzzels. Ok, fair enough, the    rubber ducky and the clamp    wasn't exactly intuitive either, but it felt sometimes as if I just had to look for the one thing in the room I could interact with to solve the puzzel. I'm extremely happy they cut out the combat though, that was completely horrendous in Dreamfall: TLJ. There is a little bit of stealth in the game, but not too much and it works fairly well and intuitively (if you're in someone's line of sight, they'll spot you, fair and square).  Voice acting is absolutely amazing,    and I'm extremely happy that they had Sara Hamilton still voice April's character    and with the decision-making mechanic, you can actively alter parts of the story, and face the consequences of your choice. As far as I know,    there a no multiple endings, but main characters will live or die based on what choices you make.     Long story short: It's an amazing game so go play it, but not before you have played The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey!",

            "review_text": "I can easily say that 'Dreamfall: The Longest Journey' is one of my favorite games of all time. Much to my displeasure however, this game is _nothing_ like that game.  Negative: Techincal issues: First off, let me stress that this is another one of those badly coded Unity games that are becoming a far too common sigh recently. No matter what kind of hardware you try to throw at this game, it will struggle to ever reach 60 or more FPS. Throwing better hardware at it does nothing as it wont utilize the hardware. There is no SLI support either. A real shame and a showstopper.  Script: The script is premature and there is a lot of vulgarities that are out of place and _forced_ into the dialog, unfitting for both the scenery and the game as a whole. Comparing the D:TLJ to this is like night and day in how believable it is. It is innocent and beautifully crafted.  Mixed: The story is good and interesting, bit i feel like there is too much grinding put in to keep you occupied in order for things to unravel. Running around a city 10 times to find small pieces of &lt;thing&gt; is just tedious.  Positive: The artists have done a SPLENDID job on this one, good work, i love it. Really.",

            "review_text": "The thing about stories and settings, in modern-day fiction, is that there's very little room for innovation or unique ideas to craft worlds without feeling like it's something we've seen before but executed differently. I'm the kinda of person who loves stories that are self-contained without being treated as a brand that inevitably needs to be pumped for money, or more sequels, faster than an OD'ing alcoholic solely for the sake of the former, and not so much for doing something new with the subject matter. The thing is; A good sequel uses the original as a jump-point to take features, mechanics, things that worked the first time around into new and interesting directions -- whereas a bad sequel merely wallows in the original like a pig in a pond of its own feces.  Dreamfall/The Longest Journey, as a brand, with its setting, with its story, and as a sequel to Dreamfall, is dynamic, unique and breathtaking.  It's been a long in the making but the continuation of Zoe Castillo and Kian's stories of 2006's DreamfalL: The Longest Journey is finally here, regrettably in episodic format but what can you do, right? 8 years has it been since we left off from where Dreamfall ended, which ironically ended in the precise kind of manner I remotely despise about games, as I mentioned a few paragraphs above. Calling it a cliffhanger would be an understatement but it's been so long now that any feelings that have might been on the questionable ending has long passed and replaced with a sense of 'Reconcilliation' or 'Rebirth' as the first chapter of the overall experience is titled (or Book One if you will).  Chapters make no comprises here. It starts off directly from where the first Dreamfall left off, giving that eerie sensation that it litterally hasn't been 8 years, but both the player and Zoe seems to think so at least, judging from her elaborate inner monlogueging at least. Before we are treated to Zoe, we are presented with a summarization of what has happened, and the world itself -- In Dreamfall there exist two worlds, Arcadia (the world of magic and dreams) &amp; Stark, our world in a distatnt futuristic-dystopian-cyberpunk-inspired-23rd-century-state. This is what seperates the franchise from truly being labeled sci-fi. fantasy, or just generally be restricted by any genre, which gives a lot of free-roam for telling a fantastical story with exostic characters.  As soon as that is out of the way we are shortly introduced to a scene that showcases the sounds of a birth taking place, a scene that will make sense if one considers the scene that came right before it, which I'll avoid elaborating on due to its spoilery content, for those who've played the previous games but not this one yet -- Let's just say that it all alludes to the title of 'Rebirth' as a soothing female narration will point out. It's interesting to note that during the story, there are words that seem to reccur again and again, like reconciliation &amp; remembering, mostly in regards to Zoë's current condition, but consider these words and one will find they mean the same. It goes back to namely; Rebirth, the state of starting anew and building upon the old to create something new.  Book One is the story of Rebirth for both Zoe Castillo and co-protagonist Kian Alvane (now voiced by Nicholas Boulton, known for voicing Hawke in DA2), and as all these introductory scenes come together we find ourselves in the company of our heroine, Zoe Castillo -- She's still in a coma and even worse, she's stuck in a limbo called Storytime, where all stories goes to die, as does hers. Having somewhat come to terms with her dire situation, Zoe has garnered a purpose in this netherrealm between worlds, as she's gained powers to manipulate the fabrics of Dreams and thus she utilizes them to guide dreamers who's lost their way, and help them find their way back to reality.  Meanwhile, in the world of Arcadia, Kian has found himself facing execution after being convicted as a traitor to his people for things he did not commit in the last game. Memory doesn't serve me too well in regards to Dreamfall with everything, but Nicholas Boulton's voice acting adds that needed sense of despair to a broken man, who's been betrayed and lost so much. It's actually a quite welcoming take on the character with the new voice, but he's not alone, as Zoe's voice is also quite different. Kian, however, soon find himself being rescued by an enigmatic stranger with an eyepatch, who also briefly appeared in the beginning intro cutscene -- He reassures that Kian's story won't end here as he's somehow REALLY important to a revolution that is going on in his homeland and he's the key to turn the tide. It's safe to say that while it is seemingly uncertain how this relates to Zoë's adventure yet, it mostly likely will intertwine with hers in future episodes.  Back to Zoe, after having helped a few, poor, lost souls escape their nightmares, she soon find herself being embolded to return to her world, by a mysterious being returning from the last game, called The Vagabond. He reassures Zoë that her story has not yet ended and by returning to the real world she'll have a fighting chance against whatever it is that threatens dreams and everything we hold dear. This is where the meat of Book One begins -- Chapters is largely reflected upon the dialogue choices you makes, specifically one 'major' choice that will change the kind of person Zoe might become as she wakes up again. This is a choice you make prior to this.  Moving on from the premise and into the functions of the dialogue that I've been mentioning just now; The occasional dialogue decisions you make are rather well seggregated, and they are written as such not to cater to any pretentious moral compass. It's more or less as dredged in various idealogious, reflections of states of mind, that all seemingly makes sense in regards to either Zoe or Kian's characterization. No choice feel preposterous or even out of character which adds complexity and thus a more fulfilling and engaging experience. It's something I feel developers like BioWare, Sucker Punch, 2k or other developers who've dabbled in awful moral choice system mechanics, never seem to capture quite well. Both Zoë and Kian each have a short inner monologue for every choice you can pick, to truly draw the player into the character's mindset and be able to pick which response seems most appropriate, considering each circumstance.  It feels more or less like a neat marriage between the dialogue systems of a few noteworth RPGs like Deus Ex or Witcher, where the moral ambiguity of the Witcher and the easy-to-monitor paraphrasing of Deus Ex's systems come great together. It's gratifying to see that the quality of The Longest Journey franchise's writing is still there, and it shines just as bright with the new addition of a dialogue system for the first time ever in the franchise.  The writing being solid as it is only helps complimenting the ongoing process of bringing life to the world of Stark, as you're in the position to roam around the city of Propast -- A cyberpunk, dystopic, metropolitan, totalitarian soceity, where the affluence of Cyberpunk &amp; George Orwell really kicks in -- Corruption, conspiracies, surveillance everywhere, guard operatives enforcing their authority, junkies, the scum of the underworld, political intrigue etc. It's all of the things I really love from dystopic/cyberpunk/noir narratives mixed into one delicious cocktail.   I'm running short of characters, so I'll sum up some thoughts here -- Chapters is what I'd consider a successful kickstarter that delivers, and only truly fails with it being an episodic game, puzzles being a bit simple and choices more or less feeling like a retread of the pretentiousness of Telltale that amounts to nothing. Each dialogue option however feels intuitive, the world feels alive, the characters are great, writing solid... ",

            "review_text": "First its really hard to explain the entire premises of the game unless you play The Longest Journey, followed by Dreamfall: The longest Journey, or watch it on YouTube. This is not a pickup in the middle and you'll get things game. It is a continuation of Zoe from the last Dreamfall that completes the entire epic journey between Arcadia and Stark. That's pretty much all I can say without giving too much away.   I have to say the gameplay, story, music, was all perfect in Chapters. The ending was amazing, leaving me completely satisfied. I didn't like the second game in the series, but I recommend at least watching it if you don't want to go through the trouble of playing it. The first Longest Journey and Dreamfall: Chapters though are amazing. They have a solid story line, well-developed characters, and depending on your decisions, at least for me, a really good ending. And if you have played the first The Longest Journey, basically you get to see everything in 3D that was 2D in the first game. I really love that they brought back older elements but updated them.  There are some things left a little bit of a mystery, but they may have been solved if I made other choices in the game. I will have to watch YouTube and figure that one out for myself. Otherwise, if Red Thread games comes out with another game similar to this I will certainly support it. I completely recommend this game!!!",

The story and some of the characters: amazing. Especially Zoe, she's really well done with her thoughts, her voice lines, her script, it all comes together beautifully.  But in contrast to that, it also has:  - A very boring secondary main character. - One-dimensional and mostly pointless NPCs. - Lots of technical issues - Pretty bad graphics all in all with low resolution textures, lots of popups, clipping *everywhere* and very amateurish and stiff animations - Insanely convulted and nonsensical puzzles. And I know point&amp;click games are known for this, but this drives it through the roof and puts it right up there with Cognition or so. - The first chapter had an interesting hint system in the inner monologue of the characters. This seems gone from chapter 2 onwards, probably due to time constraints (played 4 chapters and 2-4 felt *very* rushed).  Now, don't get me wrong, like I said above it's not really terrible. Just disappointing, half-baked and really not worth the name, the price of the time.  There are *far* better point&amp;click games with more than one interesting character and a sensible story out there.",

            "review_text": "This entry in the series truly defines '1 step forward 2 steps back' 1. Most of the old characters are cardboard cut-outs now. They don't fit the roles that were set for them in the first and second game. Most painful examples for me are Brian Westhouse and Robert Klacks, they are simply atrocious in this game and i refuse to belive they're the same quirky characters that i loved so much in the past games.    For some reason they've decided to throw Klack's personality development away and make him a villian again, something his character is not supposed to be. The concept of Brian being possesed by an ancient evil is awesome, if not for the fact that they've decided to reveal that Brian's been a bad guys from the start and ancient evil has nothing to do with it, which makes no sense whatsoever.     2. Constant SJW propoganda. Zoe is a strong feminist now that tries too hard to be a wisecrack. Also Kian is apperantly gay now which also doesn't make any sense considering how he speaks of magical women back in the second game. It just feels like they've tried to highlight every character by being a social minority to make you feel for them. Most of the new characters are empty shells that shove their sexual preferences in your face. 3. Previous games loved to make fun out of cliche's, but this game is full of them and they're all put in there seriously. New plot material makes no sense and is poorly explained. I couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the whole 'first dreamer' thing and i wished it would take me back into the Draic-kin era where lore is plenty and actually makes sense.Which reminds me that we've never got to see Chavez again, while promised. Few new magical races still remain a mystery, like grubbers. It has been stated they would play a critical role in the plot but it doesn't feel like they did. 4. A lot of opportunities to build awesome characters were missing in this whole murky mess of a story that jumps from one part to another. A lot of stupid decisions where one insignificant part overstays its welcome, while obscuring a more important plot details. The only story parts that brought a smile on my face were Saga's, i wish this game would just consist of Saga's adventures alone while they would try to refine the true sequel's plot more. But woe, this opportunity were wasted and there's no turning back. What's left is waiting for the bad aftertaste of Dreamfall chapters to dissapear and just remember the good parts, while making up for the bad parts in my own mind.",

So many times I was just looking for something that would make the game move forward without knowing what I was looking for. Often this was searching in the pixels for anything that the characters would recognise. Regarding the game overall, I do not understand why the makers of the game followed the current trend of telltales' choice based games. It does not work for DFC story, and the outcome is plain and underdevelopped characters, when compared to DFTLJ. It is a pity that the makers of the game did not just focus on improving the novelties of DFTLJ (Stealth and action sequences). There are a couple of stealth sequences in DFC but they are ridiculously bad.  The story is much weaker. I think one of the reasons is that the choices in the game do not allow characters to be interesting. The choice mechanic does not suit dreamfall well, unlike some other games where the plot is completely dragged by the events (e.g. walking dead). But regardless, the plot has the fault of many TV series, as it tries over and over to surprise with continuous plot twists which end up making the plot meaningless. Still, it was nice to bring some closure to the dreamfall saga and I appreciated the much improved graphics.",

I found myself immersed in the storyline and am probably going to try and find the previous two games so that I can 'catch up' with the story so far. I found myself running around and interacting with almost everything that I could just to hear the part of Zoe's inner monologue. I also found myself laughing at some of the descriptions and narrations that she has for the area of Eurotropolis that you live and work in. Overall I'm looking forward to seeing how this game plays out in the future and am curious to see what happens in Book Two.",

I've been with the game since the kickstarter and the developers haven't disappointed. Regular updates and lots of fine tuning. Although they have chosen for an episodic release, I rather play the game in one go so I've waited until all 5 books were released.  The game itself is a worthy successor to the story and offers some nice plot twists. Choices you make actually make an impact on the story and for some of the choices you'll hit yourself in the head later on in the game, even though at the time you thought you made the right call or thinking wouldn't have any repercussions. I'm sure there's a lot of content I haven't even seen yet.  There's a pretty decent introduction to the story included in the game, but to grasp the full story you really should play (or watch a let's play) of the earlier games. There are quite a lot of references in the game that are only appreciated if you have played the earlier games.  The story is mostly linear with only a few puzzles that require you to wander around and find the right things to do. This is a plus in my case as I love to enjoy the story and not have too many distractions of pointlessly running around until I find the one thing that the developer hoped you'd logically find in order to solve the puzzle. I think a pretty nice balance is found here. The pause introduced in order to solve the puzzle allows you to appreciate the story more once it continues.  The graphics are great and the only downside I'd think of would be that there could be more expressions on the faces of the characters during conversations.",

            "review_text": "Recommended for anyone who enjoyed The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.   This game is divided into multiple books (episodes), none of which reset the chapter counter. I was confused by this at first. It makes more sense to think of the game as a volume of books with continuing chapters (book 1 is chapters 1-3, book 2 is chapters 3-5, that kind of thing).  With that said, give it until at least book 3 (chapter 6-7). I wish books 1-2 were a bit more palatable. The foul language and tense personal relationships just ground a bit on me because, in a game full of decisions, I had little control over them except at a high level. Oh well. I got past it. Chapter 3 is where it took off. Some of the early decisions can have big ramifications, but the thing is, you can only guess at their ramifications. There is no combat. The tension that combat might usually serve is replaced by decisions that you can only make once (unless you reload prior to the decision and do it again).  The music is setting appropriate, the scripting is clever (Enu is great, as is the best bird in gaming, Crow) and taps into events in previous Longest Journey games, the voice acting is clear and fleshes out the characters (again, props to Enu and Crow), and despite a bug now and then (as of this writing, 3-20-2016), I would recommend this game. 21 hours in and I'm through book 4 and waiting for book 5! If I was faster at some of the puzzles, a playthrough would have been a couple hours shorter.",

We have played all the previous Dreamfall games and have been waiting impatiently for this one. What I like about it: the atmosphere of Propast is extremely well done and it was fascinating to just explore. I like that you can make choices that affect the way the game unfolds although it is not clear in what way it affects the game as yet. Kudos to the developers for doing some radical things including role-playing Saga, a toddler! It was so cute to listen to her babbling and giggling as I explored the house and tried to dodge Dad to get to the shiny sparkly thing! The characters are not stereotypes, there is no gratuitous cleavage, what a change that is! What I don't like about it: there is not much to get one's teeth into yet but hopefully that will come. Also the people of Propast: no kids (except one), very few old people, no fat people, body types are the same (i.e. 'ideal') (great that there is a lot of ethnic diversity though). But the main problem for me is that I have to wait for the next chapter!!!!!",

In addition, Egil Olsen, a singer/ songwriter from Norway, is featured in the streets of Propast. In other words, Red Thread Games really pays attention to details.  I would say that this is one of the more successful Kickstarter games, maybe even one of the best projects in a while. The team delivers regardless of the delays they have had, inter alia the upgrade to the newer Unity 5 engine.   There is a lack of story based games that actually focus on the story rather than the fighting to create suspense and action. That is until Dreamfall Chapters came out.   10/10  /Lifecomplete",

There were maybe 2 puzzles in it, and the rest was watching cut scenes. I don't mind cut scenes at all...but...there was very little game play at all in this last book. The first 4 were brilliant. I was hoping for a brilliant final book. Now, about the ending. It took me a minute since it's been literally 20 years since I've played the original Longest Journey.

True choices and consequences (better than telltale).   Gameplay 7/10 - Although I love the story, sometimes I wonder why the developers opted to construct the gameplay the way they did. It feels awkard sometimes. Some tasks are just random and almost no clue is given. Navigating on the open world is tedious and there is a lot of backtracking. You do not carry a map, which is only available in selected places.

You adapt extremely quickly though and before you know it you find yourself stuck in yet another beautiful game.   The fun part about this game is the fact that you feel you're watching a movie - and actually get to choose some of the plot yourself, a lot of people has criticized the story but i personally love it! Red Thread Games just posted a great movie for those of you that either can not remember the story from the previous games, or the ones that has not played either of them. I don't feel it is a 100% necessary for you to know the story behind but it will absolutely enhance your perception of the game.  It is an absolutely stress-free game so far, and a game you can enjoy whether you're tired, up for a movie, ready for some action or just bored and looking to spend some easy time. This, combined with loads of riddles, makes it the perfect game.  A few glitches here and there as the game is still in an early stage, but the publisher is really listening to their players when it comes to reports and bugfixing etc. I still have not stumbled across any glitches that are severe enough to require a report.   As i mentioned earlier, this is yet another beautiful game. I have always favoured Arcadia and seeing the graphic quality-facelift they've put on stark, i can hardly wait for loads and loads of more level designs and hopefully lots of Arcadia. I'll be like christmas everytime a new chapter gets released. Well done, red thread games! I love it and the game absolutely lives up to my expectations.",

This is the third part of a trilogy: The Longest Journey -&gt; Dreamfall -&gt; Dreamfall Chapters. I didn't like The Longest Journey - too many puzzles, weaker plot - didn't finish it. Dreamfall and Dreamfall Chapters are completely different - more videos, fewer puzzles - more like interactive movies. I recommend to play Dreamfall before this one for better experience.  The pros are clear, the cons are: no good map (finding places sometimes takes much more time than it should), some puzzles (don't like puzzles). Though puzzles are not a big deal - if stuck I just read the walkthrough - that way they didn't bother me to much.",

On a negative side, the game still feels like a beta quality - most importantly, the performance is not really optimized and the FPS is poor. This is partially attributed to Unity I guess but even with that in mind I believe there's still a lot of space for optimization. Also, there are hundreds of anoying and not so annoying lesser bugs. But all of these could be easily fixed before the next chapter - so no worries here. Great game with tons of bugs is way better than a poor but polished one in my book.  Other than that, things are looking pretty amazing for Dreamfall Chapters. Most importantly, so far this looks like the true TLJ game to me. The storytelling, the characters the atmosphere, the locations - all is in place and lives up to the high bar of expectations set by the original games. It seems like the team behind the game has made a solid work and clearly has an ambition of delivering the best TLJ experience possible (given, of course, the short budget they have).  So far, only the first of five books (episodes) has been released. While most players seem to complete this episode in ~5 hours, it took me ~8 with all the exploration. This btw is quite long for an episodic adventure game as most of the Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us episodes are clocking in at 2-2.5 hours. So we can expect at least 25 hours of TLJ goodness for a fair price of just under $20.  For those of you wondering - please don't expect Red Thread Games to charge you more for each episode. You buy the game now, pay once and get the episodes as they're ready to roll.",

Overall, this game is definitely worth buying for the story and the experience as a whole.

Dreamfall Chapters continues the rich lore and storyworld first established in its predecessors and strives to provide that same level of storycraft and immersion.  That said, I am not sure if a newbie to the franchise would get much out of Chapters. So much of it, including the characters and settings, are direct continuations of Dreamfall (and The Longest Journey) that I don't think it would be very 'new user friendly'.   Also, I would say it is more helpful to think of this as an interactive story or comic book on par with Telltale Game's offerings rather than a full-on video game. In that sense, Chapters is a good successor to the point and click adventure, but it is much different than most other games today. People looking for continuous action, open world exploration, or a handholding tutorial will be disappointed greatly as the game does one thing--narrative--and it does it well, often at the sake of other game play features.  The graphics are also somewhat dated, but still quite nice. The people look a little plastic, but the voice acting makes up for that and then some.  So, all and all, I would definitely recommend Dreamfall Chapters, with the cavet that you should plan on playing The Longest Journey and Dreamfall as well or you will miss out big time. I hope that Chapters is successful and inspires more entries in the franchise, as this is a very unique world that bears much more exploration.",

            "review_text": "I've been a very big fan of any decision making game. Life is Strange, Heavy Rain, etc. I even loved how your choices throughout the Dragon Age series effects the future games in a way. But I feel this game takes it to a whole new level. In many choice based games you end up feeling that the final decision makes all the choices in between fell pointless. So not to spoil the game, I will leave out the name, but one has a final decision of saving one or sacrificing that one to save everyone else, and despite the toughness of the decision, you may or may not feel like being nice to everyone else, or mean, or accusatory, was completely trivial since they're just dead.  However, in Dreamfall, you feel like every decision will not only effect you, but a person you care about too. And the effect of some decisions will make you think 'Did I just trade a good friend's life for a good friend's life?' Rather than choosing a lesser of two evils, you feel you need to pick between two equally bad decisions that can put people in jeopardy. You end up feeling like if you reload and change your decision, you might hurt someone else just as badly. So rather than a traditional 'choice based' game it in turn seems to be more of a 'punishment for your actions' most of the time. Even ordering the lunch in episode one seemed to have more of a consequence and visible change in the relationship between your character and other characters, even though you look at it and think 'ordering lunch is such a trivial decision, why did they add it?' But it has a lasting effect. I'd compare this to watering your plant in Life is Strange, correct me if I'm wrong please, but that action seemed to be pointless. I don't remember in my few playthroughs of that having an actual effect, other than the plant sprouting, but I could be wrong.  Now I understand the premise of those other games I mentioned, listed and left out, are different, but I just feel like this is a game where you feel like every decision actually has a lasting effect. Not just on the lives of others, but relationships too. Sometimes you feel like 'I'm making progress with this character, he/she is starting to like me' but unfortunate circumstances rip them out of your character's life. And other decisions you made that didn't seem like the; lets call it a line of cause and effect, I'll refer to it as a line, so think of it like a string, it doesn't seem like that line of decision making would matter with other lines, but suddenly, those lines intertwined and start having an effect on one another.  The game makes you realize something that's not just true in some games, but is true in everyday life, things you say and do, no matter how trivial it may seem, mayeffect the people around you, not always physically, but how they look at you or your relationship with them, whether a friendship or otherwise.  Now as for the game's premise. I played the first two games as well, and despite everyone's *****ing and moaning about the second game in the series, I've enjoyed the whole series and world. I feel since the first game, it's gotten deeper with more of a depiction of social issues but in the past and present. And that makes it feel that much more realistic. I never could've imagined just how interesting a story about 'dreaming' could be until I found these games. The rivalry of 'science and faith' that is ever so present in modern culture. The 'crusades' that are talked about and in motion in the final game. And a very '1984' type feel to it at times. The list could continue for the points of the game that could relate to history or the present, but some of those would spoil, so I won't continue.  I know that people were upset with the structure of the second game, 'the story' was not good enough, 'not the same gameplay style' I've seen somewhere about it. I think that one may refer to it not being point and click. Yes, it's too bad that now you have to use TWO HANDS to play a game. Partially. However I thought it was a great lead in to this game. And you have to realize, the first was made in 1999, the second in 2006 (correct me if either years are wrong) as technology advances, the game does too or it could get left behind. I hope everyone one who plays the game judges the whole series rather than individual parts, as I think it's a masterpiece when played. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes story, choices and some puzzles to be predominant in a game.  I am ecstatic for the last book and eagerly await.

Seeing these amazingly well written characters again is like being reunited with old friends. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a lover of good stories, even non-gamers.  Disclaimer: This review only covers impressions from book 1.  So... About the game. If you are looking for a fast paced game with a good combat system, this game is not for you. There is no combat. If you are easily offended this game is probably not for you either. It is a mature game, and characters in it reflect the wide variety of people you find in the real world. There are offensive characters. There is profanity. It is relatable. On the topic of characters, that's one area where this game truly shines! The characters you meet feel genuine, they feel complex. Real. This is a reflection of the overall fantastic writing which is revealing a thought provoking, deep and mature yet magical story. The dialogue alone had me laugh out loud on several occasions, while other moments pulled at my heartstrings. Of course this is only book one, but it is clear that great things are set in motion already.  About choices. Choices make up a key aspect of the actual game-play. They are difficult! Generally there are no obvious good vs. evil choices. Most are morally grey. But they do impact your story in important ways. To help you make the choice you will hear the PC's inner though process as you mouse over each choice. This very effectively serves the dual purpose of letting you get to know the characters better while helping you guess at what the PC will say.  This game is visually stunning. Sure, if you compare it to the flashiest of the AAA next-gen titles you might find the graphics a bit lacking. But the artstyle is fantastic and it is clear that the world has been crafted with a careful eye for detail. The two worlds of Stark and Arcadia feature very distinct styles, yet there is a cohesiveness that tie them together.  The Soundtrack is simply amazing amazing. There is one spot in Europolis where you will find a crowd of NPCs around a musician, and I found myself standing around for a few minutes just listening. But even the music coming out of radios, night clubs and the 'atmospheric' music is all highly effective and does a great job of underlining the impact of the story. The voice acting is also absolutely superb. Better even than most AAA titles I have played. I must admit it took some getting used to the new voice for Zoe, but she does such a good job I quickly got over it.  TL:DR - If you love a good story and great characters, buy it. The interactions with Shitbot alone are worth it.",

The first and a half episode is quite well made, having a little bit of the magical atmosphere of the first game. Unfortunately the plot kicks in, and it turns out to be the same one as in Dreamfall. WATI wants to build a bio-engineered device that shapes reality with dreams only this time not to sell it to millions and brainwash them, but... to conquer the world (and reshape it a bit). On the other side Azadi are doing the same thing but with steampunky thingies. It's basically Dreamfall only this time without a cliffhanger (yet, if you played TLJ, you already know the ending anyway).  I was disappointed about what Dreamfall did with 'heritage' of TLJ, but it had some really well made elements, one of them being the, as I call it, 'Azadi dychotomy' (ok, a little far-fetched name, but you get the point). Azadi freed Marcuria from Tyrens who were bloodthirsty, barbaric, murderous invaders, but afterwards started an occupation of their own. They imposed their religion on Marcurians, built a ghetto for magicals, but on the other hand saved the land, brought technology and advanced civilization, gave home and a warm meal to many. They discriminated magicals, but they didn't close them in labour camps or exterminate them. It was a really nice conflict of views best shown in a memorable talk between Kian and April. In Dreamfall Chapters however (a little spoiler) the Azadi are steampunk nazis, who start a genocide and want to rule the world as one pure race. There goes the subtlety...  There is some good stuff in Dreamfall Chapters (the second Saga interlude, Kian's first mission, Enu!), but there is a lot more bad. Hours of aimless wandering around Europolis, tons of exposition that is not only heavy-handed, but is a repetition of exposition form previous game, really (really, really) bad optimization and lags, maximally simplified plot and characters towards the end. Even Crow is not that clever and funny anymore (ok, now I'm just being grumpy).  In the end, the TLJ trilogy is like the Matrix trilogy. The first movie was great, but... No, wait. It's more like like Star Wars prequels. You are happy about a new adventure set in your favourite universe, but when you finally get there to experience it... ('Walking and talking, sitting and talking, sitting on a couch and talking').  If you played first two games, I would recommend to buy this one during a sale for a low price just to get (mostly) disappointed by yourself and reassure yourself that the only good game set in this universe is the original The Longest Journey. Playing it's sequels only makes one appreciate it more and more.",

I know this turned into a rant, but hell, it's worth it, trust me. AMAZING GAME, graphically as well as Gameplay :)",

For reference I played The Longest Journey for the first time only within the last couple years. It was excellent. Then I played Dreamfall, and it too was excellent. Maybe it was because I don't have rosy nostolgia of TLJ that I was actually more drawn into Dreamfall. TLJ was perhaps excecuted better, with Dreamfall having lousy and unnecessary combat, and the Kian parts seemed tacked on and didn't make much sense to me. But Zoe and her story made her as much a real person as any fictional character has ever been to me. So, having just finished chapter 5 I feel I can finally review Dreamfall Chapters.   Before weighing good and bad I want to say this. If you want an action game, this isn't it. There are cutscenes and sections that are just conversations, some of them reasonably long. This game is in so many ways, a story. An epic one at that. And one thats not even about winning. Your decisions really affect things. Bad things will happen.  The Bad - I don't have the newest computer so i wasn't able to run the game at its highest graphic quality. The only reason this is bad is the graphics look sooo good. Its the first game I actually thought about upgrading my computer just so i could push the graphics up. - There are some graphical glitches. The odd torn texture, animation stutter. Nothing game breaking. - The time between chapters was painful. But its all out now so if you're just picking it up now you're gold.  The Good - What you do really matters. What you do in each chapter not only affects that chapter, or even the next chapter, but everything that comes after.  - The story is so good. You will laugh, you will cry. Characters that fell a little flat in Dreamfall like Kian are fleshed out. - The graphics really are amazing - You will care. Barring everything else, like the best kind of book, you will care. The whole series, TLJ, Dreamfall, and Chapters are so well done when it comes to story.   In the first line of this review I stated this isn't a game, this is an experience. And it is. If you take into account TLJ, Dreamfall and chapters as a whole, probably the best gaming experience I've ever had. I can only hope that they make The Longest Journey Home to complete the journey.",

Those graphics feel so epic, in my very own opinion, they can surely be a patch on other AAA Games released in this year (Despite some little bugs, which are in EVERY game !) Right at the beginning you're fully pulled into the story, you feel along with the characters, it feels for me as I would be in this world by myself. Still, it's just the first book with two chapters, but I knew from the first minute (as I am such a big fan of Zoe), that I love this game, and yes, I do. I'm really curious about how it goes on. For everyone, who likes the first and / or the second title of the series it is a 100% must. For all others, who like adventures, there is no way around this game - but I still recommend the first and the second title, first to know the story ( otherwise you'd be having some big question marks in your head) and second, they are fun too, doesn't matter how old they are.

This isn't the tiny rooms of the Walking Dead, we're talking huge cityscapes.  You have the choice and consequence of modern adventure games, and the best of dialog and inventory puzzles from the classics. You won't be hauling masses of stuff around with you, but you will be combining items. And, while we've not seen the outcomes of many decisions as yet, there's at least one major character who you can entirely miss depending on your choices.  And, most importantly, it absolutely lives up to the writing of the classics. There's more dialog then you'll ever hear in one play through, often with escalating jokes hidden away behind examining items multiple times, incidental background events and internal monologue. Zoe has matured into a witty and engaging heroine, and you will relate to her problems and struggles as you wander her world. It's a game that genuinely deserves to call itself mature, because of the themes it fearlessly explores, not the amount of blood it splashes around.

            "review_text": "*Note: this is only a review of Chapter 1. To be updated*  Summary: Dreamfall Chapters is a story and choice focused game with minor puzzle elements; heavily borrowing mechanics from The Walking Dead. It has a lot of great aspects, such as good atmosphere, interesting characters and great voice-acting. However, poorly designed puzzles, as well as a long and drawn out section towards the end of the game left me bored. The game has a lot of promise, but after playing the first Chapter I cannot recommend buying it yet.   Long version: Dreamfall chapters is the sequel to The Longest Journey and Dreamfall. Like The Longest Journey it has a great setting and rich backstory in the technological world Stark and the magical world Arcadia. Unlike The Longest Journey however, the Dreamfall Chapters is NOT a puzzle game. Rather it is a story and choice focused game which happens to have some puzzles thrown in from time to time. Very much reminiscent of The Walking Dead in that respect. This move away from puzzles and focus on story is neither good nor bad, it just means it is a fundamentally different game from The Longest Journey and will appeal to different people. The Dreamfall Chapters offers up a wonderful world and good characters which are well-written and well-voiced. The choices are a fun aspect to the story, though I do not think they will make me want to replay it, and it is sometimes a bit unclear that you can actually make a choice (which made me accidently leave someone to get tortured… my bad!).   My biggest problem with Dreamfall Chapters is pacing and the puzzles, however. The great thing about The Longest Journey was that it managed to combine intricate (sometimes ridiculously complex) puzzles with a good story and interesting characters. The puzzles here are very bare bones and feel disconnected from the rest of the game which focuses so intensely on the story. The puzzles, on the other hand, feel like they are getting in the way of the story, slowing it down rather than adding to it. And as soon as I was stuck on a puzzle the wonderful façade that the game had painted started to crack. What looked so good when I was exploring suddenly contained nothing to interact with, no people to talk to even in a crowded marketplace when the goal is to buy something, no hints as to how to progress. You eventually find the solution, more by the absence of alternatives rather than any brilliance on your part. In a real puzzle game the puzzles themselves are the point and there are usually other puzzles to solve if you are stuck. In the Dreamfall Chapters there is nothing but a story which is not progressing.  This problem is compounded by the deliberately slow pacing of the later parts of the chapter. The city you find there is at first lovely and looks to contain endless details to explore. However, that quickly turns out not to be true. The number of things to interact with is incredibly limited and the snail pace movement of the main character and the absence of a fast-travel system, quickly turns moving around the city into a grind. As I was finally running Zoë home after a day in her life, I completely understood why she did not want to fight with her boyfriend. I was very bored of running back and forth on the map where I had already seen the sights and heard the conversations, watching Zoë awkwardly zigzag after my keyboard commands that obviously should have been controller commands.  I was sure I would be recommending the Dreamfall Chapters after the first 1-2 hours, but after finishing the first chapter I am concerned. The lazy puzzle design and the dragged out city section really distracted from the story and left me feeling bored rather than interested in what will be coming next. It is a shame, because the game has a lot to offer and a lot of potential, but right now I cannot recommend buying this game.",

            "review_text": "This game was a disapoint to me. even trough keeping in mind the fact that it is only one chapter the game looks unfinished in the details. more then once i come across rooms where the objects where misalligned. The puzzles are a bit odd to say the least. the game is an increadible slow boild.  an excample of a puzzle that was odd would be, and i got to spoil here:     in the harbor you have a robot called kit robot, you need to remove some barrles from the river. one barrle is unmovable by the robot. the other is. but the secence you need to complete the puzzle is strickt. remove barrle one, then you can get the robe, then ring a bell. what fustrated me was that their was no need for the stricktness. their was no reason why you could only get a robe after the first barrle was removed.   for the story wise, might be that i never played the previous game; i did not get the story. for what it was worth it seemed alright, some intresting characters, memorie loss and other ideas that might just involve in an intresting story in the next chapters.  yet the game does not make me intrested in playing the next chapters or the previous game to get the story. the game pulls out some nonos in story telling by telling most of the story instead of showing, having some unrelated scenes to this chapter that take a huge amount of time. for example, another spoiler here.    in onepart of the game you play in the past and need to escape. even trough you had no fighting scenes it was prity intense for an interactive story telling. but the tension was not build propperbly, it consists by walking around a lot trying to find a way to open the next part of the game. now the set up as a prison riot would make you think you have some time limit, but no. another missed chance. after that you go back to Zëo in a futuristic world. that point this game grinds to a hold and leaves the hand breaks on for the rest of the way. get dinner for boyfriend, get to work, and do some volentairy work.    only towards the last part of the game I get to some plot relevant ideas. everything in the middle is jsut filler.  One more point that grinds my gear is the way the choice system is set up. the choices you make will be remembered for the next chapters. the outcome depends on what everyone who played the game made. and that is where i feel the choice system falls appart. i don't care what other poeple choicen, i want to see my play trough, my choices to come to conclusion.   to conclusion: it might be an intresting story burried somewhere in a game with the lack of good puzzles and unfinished level design. Trough the graphics are good, it falls part with the attension to details and keeping some tension in the plot going up. I would not recomend the game at this point, maybe with the second chapter it will improve, trough the first chapter is the chapter that should have drawn me into the game to the point i can't wait for the next chapter.",

A series of tweets from the developer just before release of book 5 strongly implied that this game would have at least 2 different endings. Alas, no such thing.

I spent 2.5 out of the 5 hours I played the first episode trying to navigate that city and figure out the sad excuses for 'puzzels'. The gameplay seriously feels like padding, just watering down the awesome experience this almost is... My other beef is the horrible optimization in some areas. That seriously just about did it for me when I was controlling the man in the fantasy land. But I stuck it through, and I think i'm glad I did. I love this world they have created and the feelings and humor that come with it. Hopefully there wont be as much unrewarding busywork in the future of this game.

After playing The Longest Journey, some things made a bit more sense and I could see the root of the origins now, but it is no means necessary to play them to enjoy the story this game has to offer.  What is quite remarkable in the game, how ambitious it is. It is developed by a small developer and small budget, but they havent cut corners and made a small game because of this. No, the game is pretty huge for adventure game standards, and the environments vary a lot. There is easily a tripl AAA ammount of environments and graphics in this game, albeit not of that high standard except at some points. The graphics are still good enough imo.  Story starts a bit slow, but starts to build up after a few chapters... which is kind of slow, and I can see some people stop playing this because of the slow start. It pays in the end though, and journey reached peaks I didnt imagine it could.  Biggest problem beside the slow start is somewhat boring puzzles. You merely run from place to place to find objects from the environments, making most of the puzzles feel like taxi missions in RPGs. Well, at least you dont get stuck. In its way, this game feels like an RPG like Mass Effect or Dragon Age...except that there is no combat or dungeons, only the city parts! Not every game needs to have action sequences, but I couldnt help but feeling that something is missing here... Imagine playing Mass Effect which only has cities and no combat at all, and this game feels like that. It is a bit boring due to this at times, especially in the beginning, but when the story gets more compelling, I stopped caring about that aspect.  Well, if you want an epic adventure journey with interesting worlds, characters and settings, and an excellent, excellent animal companion who travels with you through all it, this is a good pick.",

Dreamfall Chapters fully lives up to the excitement of the first two games in the series,  At the time of writing, only part 1 of the story has come out, and while it does not go particularly deep into the overall story, I have no doubts the rest of the parts will be equally enjoyable.  A word of caution though: This game does offer a brief recap of the story so far, but that mostly serves as a reminder to those of us who haven't played the other games for many years. If you're new to this franchise, then this is probably not the game to start with. It will most likely leave you too confused about the story unless you play at least Dreamfall first, and preferably also The Longest Journey.",

Book one should be much longer. It should be the foundation for the other books! Especially considering that most of us players (I am assuming) have not played the first game. I ended up playing this game for about 7 hours, but I explored EVERYTHING so another players play through could be different. Somewhere I read that for most it was about 4 but that seems fast.  The story is so good though, it really grabs your attention. It's also obvious that they put alot of thought into the future of this game considering some of the dialogue loves to give little hints at what the game makers have in mind.  So overall yes buy this game, if only to see how story driven games should be. With more story on the way.. (March 10th) this game is and should be one heck of a ride.",

There were times where a cutscene was playing and a fight would ensue, but instead of animating all that, the camera would jjust pan away and you would hear cartoon effect sounds of fighting, for the camera to pan right back and you would see all the enemies down on the floor.

That's when I started frantically searching for the next game in the series - I mean there had to be another one right?- that ending wasn't enough - I needed closure, I needed to know what happened next!   Fast forward to 2013 - I was ecstatic to learn that there was a Kickstarter campaign to make the 3rd game happen. I immediately backed the game and the waiting game began. At the end of the day, I am glad the developers waited for the right circumstances and took their time, in their own terms to make this game happen. Because it is a piece of art. It is one of the best - if not the best- game I have ever played in this genre and it is one of my all time favorites.   TL:DR if you are looking for an amazing story/gameplay/atmosphere buy this game. Multiple stories unlocked by individual decisions add to the replay value of the game, and the ending does not disappoint. - Though playing the previous games in the trilogy is not absolutely necessary to enjoy this game, it is recommended to enjoy this game to its fullest.",
