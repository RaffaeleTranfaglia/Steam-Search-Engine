            "review_text": "This game reminds me of Jets n Guns! include UPGRADE SYSTEMS which is a must for Shump. I've read some bad review comment about this game which is COMPLICATED?? CONFUSING?? , i dont see anything so confusing or complicated. If you want simple NO BRAIN or PLAIN Shump with only shoot to kill using 1-2 button with just pick up upgrades in space, then this game is not for you. Just play a simple game like Raiden etc. For me that kind of simple game is just waste of money which you can complete in short time.   PROS - Multiple upgrade systems - Ability to shoot using difference way and weapon combination - Some mission require some weapon skill (just like Megaman X) - Close to reality (the ammo or energy is not infinity) - Not a plain boring simple Shmup with simple pick up upgrades or just shoot to kill. - Great graphic, music and gameplay  CONS - no SPEED/BOOST upgrade found yet since the ship move quite slow  (basically the upgrades is not better than Jets n Guns) - quite slow Shmup - Not easy to earn money for upgrades   RECOMMENDED FOR ADVANCED PLAYERS.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, I only got this to compare against JnG and my own thing. To be fair, it's got a few interesting aspects that are recognizably mutated from mechanics in other genre entries.  But the ship is so infuriatingly slow at the start that I'm really not inclined to keep playing. Sure, it's just the beginning, and I'm not expecting a fully upgraded Atomic Emu up front. Something on the level of the free starter ship from JnG, maybe, but I suspect this thing might actually handle worse than JnG's space race pirate ship, possibly even the unupgraded cargo ship. I feel like a Predator pilot yelling 'CLIMB YOU PIG' moments before the engine cuts out and the drone just falls out of the sky.  It's not a great feeling.",
