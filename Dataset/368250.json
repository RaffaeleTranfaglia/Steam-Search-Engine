            "review_text": "Valiant: Resurrection is a solid RPG that has an interesting world and characters. Despite taking only about 10 hours to complete, the game does a great job of presenting a very unique world that is well detailed and fun to explore. The world feels very different and isn't a typical take on a generic fantasy world. There's numerous optional side quests that flesh out the game and don't feel like chores. The story for the game is interesting. It starts out a little cliché but quickly gets more complex past the first hour. The bosses are challenging, especially the first two in the game. There's no need to grind XP or items really, the game follows a pretty natural progression. The economy is tight, espeically early on but eventually you'll have enough money to get everything you need.   The main character is likeable and the other characters are interesting. Combat is pretty standard stuff. Strategy is mostly needed for the boss battles. There's 13 achievements which are all pretty easy to get. I would recommend the guide, however, since it helps if you get stuck or lost and it gives good info on the side quests and 30 optional hidden gnome rooms. As far as negatives, I found the music to just be standard, not exceptional. There isn't much variety in monsters fought in dungeons, but you don't have to do too much fighting in the game. I noticed several typos / grammar errors towards the end of the game. Other than that, it was a very solid game. If you like oldschool RPGs, I highly recommend Valiant: Ressurrection. It has a good plot, fun characters, and a unique setting that makes it a great 10 hour rpg romp. In fact, I almost didn't want the game to end!",
