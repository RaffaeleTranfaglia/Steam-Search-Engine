            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game. I really tried to. I just couldn't, for a number of significant reasons.   Overall Rating- 4.9/10 : I wish I could give a Neutral Rating, but since I can't, I have to go negative. I just can't recommend this game, at any price over 85% off with a clear conscience.    Now, I hope you understood that, up there. ^^^  Or will read further to gain an understanding.  I did not hate the game, I just did not feel it lived up to it's hype or advertisements. The great potential it had was wasted, completely. The game does have some really beautiful and creepy graphics. But a few pretty or interesting screenshots does not make a good game. It just does not warrant a Positive review in my opinion.    Pros:     Nice graphics with caveats (see Cons).    Music is good and fits the game well, but caveats again (see Cons).   Good concept- sadly wasted however.    Mostly easy Steam achievments, even the 'missables' are hard to miss, except for 'The Mist'. (I had to resort to looking at a Guide after I completed the game blind, to see how to pop that cheevo.)   Trading Cards and Steam Achievements- achievements aren't difficult, and the TC's drop quickly and have a decent gem value. Honestly, this is the biggest 'Pro' of the game.     Cons:     Did not live up to it's potential or advertised hype. The second video on the Store page had a Dev compare it to a Stephen King novel. Not even close. It's like comparing 'Green Eggs And Ham' to 'The Stand'.   HORRIBLY optimized. My rig far exceeds minimum requirements. I had severe stuttering, huge fps spikes, and a few *almost* runnerbanding incidents (dropped to 1 fps and then shot back to 45+ fps suddenly for no apprent reason...). My GPU didn't even break a sweat, but the performance issues and fails really broke any immersion I could get into. It was constant, and made the game choppy, and almost unplayable.   Graphics - Although some of the scenes had a nice, creepy feel thanks to the graphics, many things were too dark, too light, too blurred to read (letters and notices in particular, even in fullscreen, were so hard to see and read that I had my face planted with my nose touching my large, widescreen, good quality and resloution, backlit monitor, squinting to try to make out the blurry text- pointless aggrivation from this.) And yes, I adjusted every setting in the game, and on my PC and NVIDIA Control panel, all to no avail.   Music- Though it fit the game, it was badly timed and repetitive, and telegraphed the game's progression too much, too far in advance. The build up of the music too far in advance of a 'scare' made the scare too predictable to have nay real effect, and the build up music often lasted for long minutes before the 'scare' or 'event' occurred.   Pacing- the pacing on this game was awful IMHO. Some parts were too fast, many were to slow. The ending? Slower than a snail on thorazine. Do the same thing over and over, until you are screaming 'Just make it STOP sometime this year!!!', to get to a completely anticlimactic ending. Awful.    ZERO replay value. ZERO.    I was really hoping for something more chilling, scary, thrilling, gripping or at least immersive from this game. I got a poorly optimized and overhyped, dingy, Dollar Store paperback novella instead. It had great potential, which I honestly feel was completely wasted on this game. A true disappointment from this studio. A real shame.  I just can't recommend this game to suspense, thriller, horror, psychological thriller, scary game fans with a clear conscience. If you get it as part of a bundle from a bundle site (as I did), it's worth a playthrough, just because you have the game key. Just don't have high expectations like I did. Full price? NUPE, never. If you can get it for 85% off or better here on Steam, pick it up if you have a few pennies to throw away for no good reason. Why not. Trading cards do drop quickly, and have decent gem values for the 3 drops you get.",

            "review_text": "First off, The Park is not a bad game, it is just not what you expect. Sure, the starting atmosphere is spooky and you get a little bit of a haunted feeling. But there is no follow through. You look for your son in a dark theme park that feels scary and every so often you are interupted by some story your protagonist feels the need to share. Not to say the story is bad, it just doesn't support the game - at least not until you reach the end and it all kinda wraps up. This story telling the game does, negates the whole effect of the dark atmosphere. And soon you will grow complacent in the game. Maybe a jump scare or 2 will startle you, but it never quite feels scary anymore. Quite a shame really.  So in the end; don't buy this game if you are looking for a scary or haunting experience. Don't buy it for the story either. Truly the only reason to recommend this game, is if you are fairly new to horror games and want an easy ride.",

I am not much of a horror fan myself, and was worried it would be going for those cheap jump scares every time. But luckily that was not the case, there where some moments that got me good, but overall it's more a creepy vibe then going toward those cheap shots most horror games have now a days.  While not a very long game (Hour and a Half) it was still a satisfying experience for me, and if you play The Secret World you will get a kick out of it. $10 might be too much for some folks in terms of playtime. but with a good discount i can highly recommend a go at it.  Also a good point is that the graphics look really nice and the voice actors did a awesome job in their performance.",

In effect it's a horror movie that you play through, more than a game per'se, but this isn't a shortcoming as the writing, atmosphere and depth of storytelling is superb. A real testement to Funcom's writing department!  You'll get a lot out of this game if you've already played through The Secret World and know its story intricacies inside and out, but it isn't only enjoyable by that crowd. As I played this game, a friend of mine watched, and as he had not thoroughly explored The Secret World, but knew a little about the world, he found the horror elements really pulled him in and immersed him.  If you're looking for a horror experience that eschews jumpscares (save for a joke or two) in favour of real forboding, atmosphere and a haunting feeling then The Park is a must-buy. Get it quick while it's only $10, but honestly, it's worth the $13.",

I won't go over it - if you really want to whine about it being 'TSW context related', then buy the MMORPG the game is based on instead of leaving a meager negative review because your ♥♥♥ couldn't be bothered.  This said, The Park is a nice, brilliant horror/psychological game. I have seen some people saying it's a 'walking simulator' as Gone Home is and I'm going to say to leave these people to their own convictions, mostly because they also never really bothered to actually play the game as it was meant to to, taking your pace through it and not just guzzling down as it were an absurd amount of Mountain Dew.   I've paid for full price and I also have pre-ordered it prior to its release date because it gave good gadgets for the game it spun from (again, if you believe the plot had no context, that is because you've never played TSW itself), and I've found myself scared by the prospect of having to do all of this in this creepy atmosphere. It had a nice vibe, nice backstory that leaves you guessing enough - leaves you enough to understand even fi you haven't played TSW, too - and I absolutely felt terrified and powerless.   I see this game getting shunned because it's not 'worth full price', when people have gladly paid increasingly sums of money for something like FNAF - and it's really amazing. Because all I see are whiny people that haven't bothered to understand that this game is a self-insert tie-in into The Secret World itself and has events and takes places into the TSW universe. If you didn't see it coming, I don't know what to tell you.",

            "review_text": "The Park is a first person horror game set in the world of The Secret World. You are a mother whose son has run inside the Atlantic Island Park past closing time. Things seem fine at the beginning but quickly turn dark. What was once a park full of laughter and fun quickly becomes a carnival of nightmares, and your child is lost inside. You will need to face the horros of this evil amusement park to save your child, all the while discovering the history of this twisted offering to childhood imagination. Who built the park? Why have their been so many deaths during its run? And what happened to the children that have disappeared?  The Park is a beautifully done story experience. Enough jumpscares to get your heart racing while enough psychological horror to make you go 'WTF'. It will run you about 2 hours, maybe more if you want all of the achievements to unlock the game's full history, which for $10 isn't bad. The graphics were flawless, sound was superb, the spookiness of the music often making me want to put down my headphones and turn my head around the screen. The controls are bare, there is no map, and there aren't any enemies per-se, but you won't need them when your mind is the ultimate enemy. All in all it's a great game and I'd recommended it to anyone who likes narrative games,anyone who's a fan of The Secret World, or someone who wants to take a break from action-heavy games like Call of Duty and just have a nice stroll through an amusement park.",

After playing this apparent 'tie-in' game, I'm no longer so ambivalent. I'm now quite willing to give up said life if it's AS ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD AS THIS. Which I'm pretty confident it WON'T be, but one can only live in hope.    Yes, it's a 'walking simulator'. Yes, it won't 'challenge' you...well, certainly not on a 'gameplay' or 'skillz' level. Yes, it's also not that long, and would henceforth perhaps be asking a bit much in the price department if it wasn't for the fact that it's HANDS-DOWN ONE OF THE BEST WALKING SIMULATORS YOU WILL EVER PLAY. And one of the absolute creepiest, to boot. Good story, GREAT storytelling...if you're one of those people who, like me, frequently finds themselves in arguments with less enlightened folk about the 'artistry' which is possible in video games, then here's one game which will provide you with plentiful ammunition in taking down your next such opponent. Games like this are the reason why I virtually never watch horror movies any more, in spite of the fact that I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE horror movies.   I have seen the future of horror gaming, my friends...and that future is bright. Truly gorgeous stuff.   Verdict: 9.5/10.",

            "review_text": "in July 2012, FunCom released an MMO called The Secret World. set in the modern day with an occult/conspiracy/horror theme, it'd turn out to be the best-written MMO and one of the best-written and best-acted games of all time. with a strong setting and stronger characters, TSW was primed for popularity among an unfortunately small subset of MMO players: those who wanted to really care about the setting they were in.  one of the areas you'd encounter within a few hours of your picking up the game was the park. it was one of the earliest serious puzzle areas of the game, but beyond that, it was a terrifying environment, both in terms of how it looked and the threats that roamed around it. the Park in TSW was one of the great pieces of level design of all time--comparable to and maybe better than the haunted house in Bloodlines.  enter The Park. The Park is set in TSW's Park, redesigned for a first-person narrative game. there are no challenges in The Park: it's a walkthrough game, just a story being told. it does, however, start with one of the best mechanics I've ever seen in a horror game: right at the outset, you get the ability to shout to find your next objective. giving the player the option to scream and give away their position in a horror game is one of the best ideas I've ever seen. control your own nightmare; make yourserlf feel exposed.  The Park itself (stop reading now if you don't want any inkling of the story) is about a normal person (not a TSW-style chosen of Gaia...at first) wandering the haunted park in search of her son. the plot unfolds through one-page journal entries you find and monologues from the main character. early on in the 90-120 minute experience, it comes clear that the story is really about being a mother, being a single parent, and the stresses and resentments that develop therewith. I won't explicitly spoil how it all works out, but for the TSW fans out there, know that the last scene is a wonderful TSW cameo.  in the end, The Park works. to someone unfamiliar with TSW, it might feel like an Amnesia-esque horror game, minus any threats; to someone who does know TSW, the hooks to Kingsmouth and the TSW setting in general will probably be the most interesting bits. it's short, it's cheap, and it'll either intrigue you about an MMO you should try or excite you about an MMO you have tried. what's to lose?",

Maybe I've seen too many horror movies, but the ending wasn't too surprising. I sort of guessed it before I even purchased the game, but I wanted to go along for the *ride*. My only other problem with the game would be the price tag. I thought it was cool that it played like a movie and was the price of a movie in theaters, but in the end - I think $5 would suit it better.  What I will say about this game though is I haven't played a more unsettling game in a long time. This really goes above and beyond making you cringe as your suspicions of what's going on really cement themselves. This is an insanely eerie game with a very unsettling story that I wont soon forget. Also, the environments and overall design of the game are beautiful, frightening, and captivating.",

I think it's still fair to say it's a step up from the likes of Dear Esther or Gone Home. The narrative is reletively cohesive instead of a disjointed mess of pretentious nonsense and there are even a few things in the environment to interact with. The game is actually horror instead of putting on a facade of horror so the revelation about how SUPER INCLUSIVE AND PROGRESSIVE the developers are can be called a plot twist.  That being said, 'a step up' still leaves much to be desired in this 'genre.' The regular price would've been a stretch even for me as someone who is sold by the tie-in, and you'd be best served by a 50% sale if length to cost ratio is particularly important to you.",

Lorraine lost her son a the amusement park and starts searching after him. In the coming sequences we see odd things, experience paranormal things and the context is puzzling. The last scene is surely the climax of the whole story, Lorraines story.  As I see it she was not only depressed but seems to have a traumatic story. Just think, early attachment problems, a mother who rejects her and accusing her for having abandoned her by running away with the father. Then father is gone and her relatives dont want to share the insurance amount with her. There she stands alone before she meets a man and happiness is back in her life. But not for so long. The man dies and she becomes a single mother with a low-paId job. She also had post-partum depression for which she also was hospitalized and medicated for. I interpret the park as the conscious level and the grottos and the stairs in the last part as the sub-consciuos levels. As she walk through the rooms several times she relives the trauma again and again. Slowly the repressed memories comes to a consciuos level but she actively tries to repress them. The final scene where she stabs her son seems to me to be a try to get rid of the alien part of the self. I think that her son is in custody and that Lorraine seems to be psychotic.   Overall I liked the game as mentioned earlier. There are some cons though. Gameplay is a little bad mechanised and there should have been icons popping up when reading a note and alike. Walking is too slow and I finished the game by running. The game is a little too short and could have been longer.   I recommend this game for those who fancy psycology and ambient soundtrack.",

I'll admit that most of the jumpscares caught me off guard especially when I was expecting them because there were a lot of spots where you know they would show up and they did. This is one of those walkabout games where you will spend alot of your time walking and exploring the park as you move from one ride to the next whilst looking for your wayward son.   Spoilers ahead: My main problem with this game however is it's story. You start off thinking it's going to be a horror game where you unravel the mystery of what's going on at the park via notes and incident reports. So at first glance it seems to be a story about how the proprietor of the park purchased the land from a man who commited great atrocites. The idea being that the park was going to try to be something positive in what would have been a very negative zone. As you progress through the park and read various documents you learn that there have been various deaths throughout the years starting way back when it was under construction and still occuring even after the park opened it's doors. You learn that the proprieter actually had an ulterior motive for setting up the park and wasn't as altruistic as he first seemed. Eventually the park gets shut down by health inspectors and the proprietor retreates to the horror house where his machine was.   but around the third act the game decides to forget all that and switch gears to become about the protagonist and her mindset, trying for a twist that you would have already saw coming from a mile away if you payed the slightest attention to her dialogue.   All i'm going to say as much as I liked the game the last bit of it was the weakest. I really wish they stuck it out with the regular horror aspect and had us confront whatever was controlling the park.  End spoilers.  other than that though. It's a real neat tie-in game to an mmo. that knows how to build atmospere and give a general sense of unease even though there are times you can tell when there is going to be a jumpscare well before it happens.",

The game wasn't particularly scary; I've seen worse. It was extremely unsettling. It took the time to get under your skin and stick with you. That, in my opinion, is MUCH more effective than any jumpscare. I felt on edge even after the game ended for a while afterwards.  The voice acting was surprisingly great. I didn't run into any glitches. Like I said, I was completely immersed in the atmosphere of the park. The story was surprisingly good; a lot of it left me thinking.

Horror needs more games like this, very original!   10/10",

            "review_text": "Horror games have a special place in the pit of all consuming darkness that is my heart, and psychological horror games have an even more special place. Now, let's break this down.  The game follows a depressed mother looking for her lost child in a really creepy amusement park named Atlantic something. Moving on, the game soon takes a turn for the worst when the sky darkens and you wander around with this woman talking to you, telling the most tragic (but very well written) story about her life, her contradicting views on Callum, her son, and some conversation between her and a skinny, well dressed Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas (if you don't know what I'm talking about please re-evaluate your entire life). The game seems to follow the story of Hansel and Gretel (follow the path and when you see the swan boat ride, ride it to get an achievement and a man retelling the story). References to the tale are mentioned here and there.   If you've played Outlast before (which I reccomend HIGHLY if you haven't), then you know what jumpscare and gore horror is. This is not that. I'm not saying there's not blood and bodies in this game, but the numbers, compared to Outlast, are few; however, this game is scary, but more psychologically.  Pros: -fantastic story -creepy atmosphere -sp00ky soundtrack  Cons: The only con I have about this game is that it's really short. You can finish it within an hour, which sucked because I really got into the story.  8.5/10  Hasta la vista, baby  -Citrus",

It is well put together. It is extremely short, and it is very much on rails. I don't think the decisions I made in the game really had much of a game factor. It is more like playing a twisted movie (and yes it is twisted) where your actions determine when the movie progresses to the next part.  As a developer myself this felt very much like a nifty tech demo for the Unreal Engine, almost like Funcom was messing with it to learn all the ins and outs and see where they could push it.  I am a big fan of The Secret World, and this does feel like something out of that game though this Atlantic Island Park is laid out a lot different than the area in The Secret World. This area is much bigger.  I completed this so fast I am still waiting on the third card to drop. I actually finished it in about and hour to an hour and a half. It is far too short in my mind, and it didn't feel like a game as much as an interactive movie, where reaching certain points is like clicking the button to advance to the next scene.  You do get some cool items for your Secret World account for buying this so that does make it worth something too.  Overall... I'll give it a YES, but be warned it is VERY short. It may be the shortest game I personally have ever played.",

I love games the build atmosphere and this game does a good job of that. I would call this an alternate horror game as it definitely doesn’t not share game play styles with other games in it’s genre. The biggest let down for me with The Park is that to really find out the deeper back story around the park, rather than the main story about a missing child, you have to go play The Secret World. This makes me feel like I paid for a playable advertisement for a MMO I have no interest in playing. I would still recommend the park based on it’s sound design and some of the clever use of storytelling it has. I would also recommend examining everything you can find. It is really easy to pass over small things to examine that can add greatly to the plot. Also buy it when it is on sale, and I did and I think if I had bought it at full price I would have been disappointed.  ",

In this game there is no map, except throughout the Park, and you don't have choices in where you can go, you just go straight ahead and ride the Park's attractions while reading notes while scrolling through the Prak.  Before i proceed with the Pros and Cons i would like to remind you that the following are my personal preferences and may differ for any individual who plays the game.  PROS: +The story was unique +Whilst a horror game, it isn't always based on scaring you, more like making you think +The world is well designed +The playthrough is pretty simple for new players and experienced ones to enjoy +It has some jumpscares but as many as tehre should be  CONS: -It had some fps drops and lags in-game -The characters were bad designed (even though it doesn't really matter in-game) -It was short, like 2 hours playthrough short  SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS: -Drop the price a bit, 13€ is too much for a game where no one would play more than 3 hours tops -If you decide to keep the price, make some free expansion parks so that we could experience more Park attractions -Make more games like this, this one was awesome  SUGGESTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS: -Buy it on sale, even though it is worth 13€ -Enjoy the full of it in a dark room with your headphones on, trust me, it won't be scary at all ;) -Don't worry about getting all the achievements, almost all of them will be obtained while playing the story  TL;DR This game is really good and i recomend it to anyone who is into Horror games that are not based on the actual horror but on a good frightening story  9/10 keep on Funcom!!!!",

I felt sometimes that I had to strain to read and get closer to the tv. This game is intended to be played very closely to a monitor. If the story was more developed and the actions that you take going through the park had more significance then I think it could have been much better.

Though it can be very scary at times, I just don't the fact that they say it is very focused on storytelling, which it was not. I only got a little bit out of the story and expected everything to wrap up at the end, but it doesn't. What's the dark secret of the park they want you to discover? I don't know. I just didn't get it.   The game's mechanics are pretty simple. You walk, you find notes, you read them, you continue walking. You can call for your son (whose name was so weird I can't seem to remember it) by right clicking, and I thought that was a pretty neat idea. But...  WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS.  In the end it's pointless because you kill him by stabbing him with a halloweenpumpkin carving knife in the head? I don't know.  This game is VERY obviously inspired by Five nights at Freddy's. I mean you can't get any closer. There's something that's basically like the bit of '87, but here it's a guy who worked there and they had to wear mascot suits (SOUND FAMILIAR?) who killed a bunch of teenagers for no real reason in 1979. I guess they were also going for something similar to FNaF where people speculate and theorise about it and the other incidents mentioned in newspapers and notes you find in the game, but really, they're just too vague and not too interesting. There was something going on about a guy who needs energy for a machine that makes eternal life possible or something like that, but they never really explained that. There was also a note by someone saying his old school friend who was working in the park as one of those mascots got really weird and wanted to be called chad (the name of the mascot) from then on and never wanted to get out of the suit. Now, this is a really interesting idea. But it REALLY doesn't work. Guess why? It's never mentioned again. EVER.   --SPOILERS OVER--  In the end, The Park is one of those games you play once, get kind of scared, and then never play again except for a let's play or to try harder to get the story this time.  6/10",

The Park is a Game by Funcom, the minds behind The Secret World and it plays in the Amusement Park from the same game. If you are solid in TSW Lore, skip this next paragraph if not this might help  An old man decided to harness the magic power of Solomon Island, he did so by constructing a park and using it as a Magic Circuit. However, Usually those kinds of things never go well, and it so happens that the Magic very much tainted the Park. And so during construction and while the park was running terrible accidents and way too much death happened - Until the Player Character comes along and finishes/fixes what the old man once started.  This game happens before that happens.  The Park is one of those experiences you want to be over and you want that to be soon. In a good way. The game can be finished in about 2 hours and leads you through something I never really considered to be scars - a deserted Amusement Park at Night. (Given we are in ♥♥♥♥ed Up Land, but yes.) The Game opens with a message telling you that it 'might play around with control and Audio settings' - just to f**k with you and yes, controls feel a bit sluggish at times, especially towards the end.  the Story is conveyed through the Main character, a mother whose son ran off into the Park to look for his lost teddy bear, talking to herself and occasionally when you Press X To Jason. You will also find reports, Letters and newspaper clippings, but thats not the norm here. the Atmosphere is just creepy. the park is very small but still manages to creep the living ♥♥♥♥ out of me at times. when you step into the rides you'll find that the game does not play with the usual Horror Game Frights, but more relateable ones. Losing your kid in a Park, going 60+ on a Ferris Wheel. The fact that you can only look around on those... Really gives you an increased feeling of helplessness  Audio - there is almost no music, save for a few notes around some rides and soundwise I didnt pick much up either, However onething providing mild discomfort was that at times whey would play a Bassy sound.  Overall the game is (very) short for its price, but an Experience to be had. It also extends on one of the major points in the first area of TSW.  Honestly tho, this game left me with a lot more Questions than answers. Mostly because the end just churned my brain with very cryptic stuff",

Problem: The payoff is kinda weak.  The game is way too open ended. Normally I could forgive that but.... everything about it is open ended. You can't have a open ended story without some kind of facts or grounding. There are too many explainations for what happened, and the evidence for each possibility is kinda weak. I feel like it's a better story if you don't play The Secret World because it eliminates some of these options.

The visuals were decent, though clearly limited by art budget in places. (C'mon, guys! The haunted house is filled with stationary cardboard cut-outs instead of at least mannequins?)

The atmosphere was on point, some jumpscares did get me (I admit a few times I had to pause the game to recover), whereas there were a few towards the end of the game that felt slightly cliched, no spoilers though. Although this is essentially a walking simulator, I felt immersed and loved some of the horror mechanics introduced that weren't just trying to say boo! Little touches which add to the suspense, things moving very slowly, noticing something out the corner of your eye. Its small things like this which make the game much more interesting. I was drawn in by the story, which is quite controversial, but I'll say no more. One small issue I had was the drop in frame rate at the beginning of the game, which took away from the immersion. Had to drop down to high settings which seemed to fix the issue, but felt that it shouldn't have had a problem running on ultra.  One thing which I think is important in horror games is the audio, again adding to the atmosphere, the devs got this right. All the little sounds you hear, the whispering, the protagonists desperation in her voice to find her son, and her reminiscing, all added to the immersion. Best played with headphones so you can hear everything going on around you. Overall, I would recommend this game when on sale. I completed the game in 80 minutes. While it's all about quality and not quantity, some may be disappointed with the content for the price, but if you are after something that's got scares, and an explorative experience, this is great.",

I can't outright recommend this game otherwise, you probably won't enjoy it. There aren't enough 'jump-scares' to fill a proper 'watch me shriek' YouTube 'let's play,' and a lot of the story is delivered through inner monologue and visual imagery that won't make much sense to you without the greater context.

As has been well need pointed out - the game is a brief one and not particular on player agency. The tale on Lorraine and her missing son, Callum, is what is front and center here. Thankfully the story, while not immensely surprsing, is very well told. The use of the tale of Hansel and Gretel as a metaphor to the events in the game is a nice touch that is impressively woven into the imagery of the game.   What little interactivty the game offers comes in the form of Lorraine's voice. By right clicking Lorraine calls out to Callum. This call and response mechanic not only reveals objects to be examined and functions as a guide to the next location, but also gives a window into Lorraine's mental state. The voice acting in this game deserves special mention. What is on offer is very well done.  The Park doesn't offer much. The experience can be had in roughly an hour and there isn't much reason to play again other collecting the two missable achievements or a desire to catch any symbolism that may have been missed the first time around. In honesty, there isn't even much to 'play' in the traditional sense. This is an interactive tale the user moves forward - not much more, not much less. That said, The Park is a worthwhile bit of interactive horror and well worth a spin for players looking for something a bit more experimental.  With any luck Funcom churns out more game connected to The Secret World, expermental narrative jaunts like The Park, as well as perhaps some more traditional single player experiences.",

The game is primarily story based with the player guiding a mother through the park, interacting with the various rides in order to find her son who is lost somewhere within the park.  The game excellently sets it's tone early on in the game and the creepy atmosphere is coupled with the eerie nature of the mother as she narrates her backstory as the game progresses.  Control wise, The Park is very similar to many first person horror games, such as Amnesia, Among the Sleep, etc. Move with the WASD keys, shift to run, left click to interact. There is no map to show you where you are going as the game encourages exploration. To find your way, the player presses the right mouse button to call for your son, in which your son will respond from the direction you are to go. While helping to build the creepy atmosphere, this mechanic can get a little confusing at times as you are not quite certain where the voice is coming from. This can be fixed in the options menu with a setting to provide a directional guideline along with the vocal response.  The Park's stpry is told through a mix of narration and notes hidden around the park. The narration tells the story of the player character, Lorraine, and her son. The notes reveal the dark history behind the Solomon Island Park, both methods offer quite the unnerving experience as the story plays out, building to confrontations with the park owners and the mysterious man in a mascot suit.  While the Park does sell itself very well, the price of $12.99USD is a bit steep as I was able to finish the game in under an hour, I was able to get it during the Halloween sale for cheaper, so I recommend this game, but maybe when the price is dropped.",

You could, for example, simply walk from one end of the 'map' to the other, only stopping to pick up the basic essentials you need to progress (flashlight), but you'll be missing out on pretty much all the story if you do that. Or, you can take your time and look around for items to interact with, ride the rides etc and discover the whole story.  It's the kind of game that I really enjoy at the moment, with games like 'Everybody'd Gone to the Rapture' and 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' being two of my favorite games of the last 12 months, so that, couple with the atmosphere of an old theme park, made this a no brainer for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  There's a ton of atmosphere to be found here and it's enjoyable to just walk around and soak it all in.

It's not a game for everyone though. It's not for action game fans and despite it's looks, it's not really a 'horror' game either. Sure, there is a dark theme throughout and it gets really dark near the end, but there's little to no jump scares outside osf a few cheap ones inside the haunted house, but you'd expect those in there.  Although I completed it on my first playthrough in around two hours, I still feel I've got value for money as I thoroughly enjoyed it and with two achievments still to get, I've got at least one more playthrough ahead, then more, just for fun.",

Turn the lights off , put some earphones on and get ready to feel scared. This game is in the vein of 'gone home' or 'everyone's gone to the rapture' so expect walking exploration. You are trying to find your missing child in an abandoned amusement park but things are eerily wrong. Explore, interact and learn about the history of the park, yourself and your child while feeling that tingle down your spine.  Pros: Fantastic psychological thriller. Cons: You can finish it in one sitting (about 2 hours).",

It wasn't much of a horror game either. A few jump scares here and there, and I guess some people may be scared by the setting, but nothing that would make me call it a horror game. Nothing close to Outlast or other big horror game names.   It's also not so much a game as it is a narrarated story, as said in the description. It's basically an hour of following the story, with a little effort from you to explore the park to find the next cue for the story. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a quick, 1-hourish narrarative game, but if you aren't specifically into this kind of game, I'd avoid it. I definitely liked it, and can justify the $6 on-sale price, but it's absolutely not everyones cup of tea.",
