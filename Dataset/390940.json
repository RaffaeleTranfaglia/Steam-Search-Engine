The core loop is simple â€“ You want to get from Point A to Point B and you have a mini-objective along the way. Clear the path to your end goal by gathering resources and clearing obstacles. Obstacles cost resources to clear. Spend resources to build buildings that give you more resources.   The game gradually introduces more mechanics as you go (crafting, inventory items you can equip for bonuses, boosts, etc) The levels and objectives are varied, the story is simple but sweet, and the music and sound FX are enjoyable.  10/10 Recommended",
