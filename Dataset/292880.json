            "review_text": "Easy even by casual adventure game standards, and the hidden object scenes are pretty short and basic. But it has some nice features compared to other hidden object games, like party members with special abilities and optional side quests. Plus you get more than one useful item from hidden object scene, instead of being sent back to the same scenes multiple times to needlessly pad the game. The voice acting and BGM aren't bad, either.",

            "review_text": "A lovely little hidden-object game that goes beyond the usual formula by providing side quests and an almost role-playing game mechanic. The hidden-object scenes are satisfying, the story and acting are nice, and visuals and music are charming and appropriate.  The story is a nice twist on the familiar and hokey legend of Robin Hood. Even if you're tired of this old cliché, this version may offer some surprise.  Unfortunately it's too short and too easy. It would be nice to see more games like this, but with more content and a bit more challenging!",

            "review_text": "That's the sort of game that you can play without worrying about any sort of commitment, in other words, it's simply a casual experience. The adventure is pretty much straight forward and it has a story which was developed over the legend of Robin Hood. As for a general insight, you don't really have to think hard to make progress on it and its puzzles are nice time killers. The gameplay is quite short and the replay value isn't all that great, so although I recommend this game for everyone, it wouldn't hurt to wait for an interesting discount.",

            "review_text": "It is a fun game as the guards assume they are looking for a man and not a women, I was laughing when you go to the church and a man is sleeping and does not wake up when you take some of his things. Another things this game has a hint button which can be helpful at times when stuck in the game and a good way of heping you out and also has a solve button will go to the top when ready and if stuck on a puzzle it will solve it for you which I had to do on a couple of them as I was stuck. The search for the pieces of paper can be confusing at times as sometimes it is in front of you and you don't see it  This is a good game and you have all the characters like Little john and the robe wearer john who is persuasvie which is good and nice intereactions. I am only half way in the game and can take time to do it and feel engaged. It is on special for $1.49 and worth the money spent while on special.  I finished it today and the puzzles were nice and it seems you are playing as the mother of Robin hood and you meet a young Marion, who would be older than Robin. It was funny when little john kicks the sherrif and he lands in the other room.",
