This game is merely a series of unfulfilled promises and unforgiveably poorly executed ideas. What could have been a truly amazing plot with an lovingly crafted aesthetic is instead a generic class based multiplayer shooter. Do not buy this game.",

            "review_text": "This is probably one of the most underrated games of the 21st century. I picked it up back on the PS3 originally, and despite it's flaws at launch such as mediocre AI and minor lag, (issues that were improved later into the games life) it was an absolute blast to play. The varying levels of customization were great, spanning all the way from weapons to the character itself. Not only that, but all the maps played well and looked absoulutely georgeous. The gameplay was a refreshing change to what you experienced in most FPS games at the time, with fun and flamboyant free running moves that not only looked great but were simple to execute. However, because Brink was developed by 'Splash Damage' and not 'Infinity Ward' websites such as IGN and Gamespot gave it a 6, slamming the game for it's poor AI and repetition. Sure I'd accept that if this was a game that based itself around singleplayer rather than multiplayer gameplay, but marking it down for repetition when video games such as Modern Warfare 2 get given 9's is ridiculous.  At the end of the day, this was a game that had it's head put on the block before it even got released. Sure, it's far from perfect, but it's as good as your going to get if your looking for a multiplayer FPS that's a little different from the norm.",

            "review_text": "If you enjoy team gameplay like Team Fortress 2, I suggest buying Brink. Brink is a FPS game with team-oriented gameplay mechanics with medics, soldiers, engineers, and assassins. Medics can revive team members, give accelerated healing abilities to other team members, and has specified special skills and abilities. Soldiers can give ammo and can unlock grenades. Engineers are like the engineers in TF2 where they can set up sentry guns. Not only that, they can give upgraded ammo or armor to teammates and they can also drop mines. To add to that, the members all have different tasks to do such as planting C4 to blow up bridges or walls preventing escape, hacking into systems to complete tasks, and more. The 'new' Call of Duty Ghosts fuction of running and then sliding was already utilized in this game where you can slide by pressing the hotkey. Sliding can also knock down enemies so you can kill them without them shooting back. Weapons are customizable and you can unlock some other weapons through mini-games. Depending on the size of the character you chose, you can parkour through maps, jumping off the walls and whatnot.   The only unfortunate aspect of this game is that the multiplayer is dead. I hope that my review will cause a few of you to buy this game or to take another look at this game in your library and revitalize this great game.",

This will finally weed out the whiny COD players and leave true gamers to have some fun with a game thats been designed very artistically. For starters it turns people off camping and gets them doing useful things instead, like actually taking objectives and so on.  ● The SMART system is probably the best thing to happen to games yet. I'm sick and tired of getting stuck on invisible ground objects in other games.   ● The art style of this game is extremely well done! There's post-processing done to the entire game, so you get colorful blue/orange tones depending where you are and what map.   ● Online multiplayer with skilled players or Competitive play is where its at in this game. If you have friends, its much better to go VOIP and carry out objectives.   ● Recommend this for people wanting a new specific type of gameplay!!!  ___Croatian_________  ***Fantastična igra, obavezno je uzmite na nekom od popusta.

The game is a disaster. The singleplayer is a madhouse driven by mentally-ill friendly AI characters, a disgustingly bad storyline, and some trippy, forgettable- and once again frustrating combat scenarios. The multiplayer is dominated by inhuman monks programmed to play the game, bash your face in, and then ♥♥♥♥ on your remains. The game is so bad, it's painful to talk about. It goes down as probably the most disappointing game I have ever played.  Other than that, it was good.",

The customization of characters is alot of fun to play with because there is so many different combinations to mess around with. The customization of weapons is great to have that advantage when your in a battle. The 'SMART' (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain) is awesome and is something that is not seen in games these days, you run and moving smoothly while vaulting over objects which is a fun feature to this game.

Do Not believe the reviews from IGN, they rushed in to put up a review.  Game is not fun for long to be played as Solo, as the AI system is good but can be better. (Patch on it's way)  Game is really fun to be played as a team, even if its against bots. Remember to always pick up missions on the go, as they win you games and are very rewarding.  Completing the challenges is the best way to unlock most of the useful items/weapons.  There is no in game currency as of yet other then trading ur leveling coins for abilites of your choice, which can be reset for a loss of a level.  There are two different ways to grow in this game, leveling up and ranking up. Both are rewarding in their own way.  It's true that you can have upto 42 trillion characters in this game but max of 10 at a time. The game should have been more polished to add on to the amazing look and promise of the different characters. It is a good part and a concept but not yet a game.  It was really hard for me to recommend or not recommend this game but i want to recommend this to be played but not to spend out your dollars (so please buy it on sale... but not to late so you can enjoy the online experience) so you can see how much this game has in originality in character customization and shooting while sliding our jumping up a barrier. Tons of new stuff but not utlilized to make the best of this amazing experience.

This is a game that was touted with a great amount of potential in its 'free-running' parkour-like movement system, its stylised aesthetic full of realistic human models and the plurality of their costumes and faces.  Ultimately, while these two strong selling points partially deliver, the game is let down by its pathetic Artificial Intelligence system and buggy mutliplayer implementation, which killed it before it got out of the gate. The class system based on experience provides questionable benefits requiring a huge investment of time to unlock, quite a long time after you will be bored of the game itself. The free-running aspect which has an interesting slant to it suffers in execution: it is too difficult to navigate, often vertically, while still combining gunplay and avoiding opponents in the first person perspective.

Very fluid gameplay, I did not have to change any of the controls from default. It is very smooth. Maybe it's just smooth for me, considering I've spent an embarassingly long time sitting in front of my computer playing Brink. - If you play single player, you will find the AI is on par. They have their weak moments, most definitely. But overall, they function fairly well. - Actual gameplay is more 'shoot everything that moves' rather than being on the tactical side. If you like to sit on your laurels and snipe people, this game will not be your favorite. If you generally play a tank-like character who rolls in to battle and blows up everything that breathes, you will love this game. - Sometimes has the feel of a FPS tower defense game. Especially if you play as an engineer. But I don't mind that aspect, and actually enjoy it. - Multiplayer is well developed, but could use more maps and the entire game could use more weapons. You can at least unlock attachments for your guns through the challenge mode included in the main game. - Campaign is interesting. You can play as radical terrorists on the Resistance side or as the grounded Security. There is no advantage or disadvantage to the sides. Weapons are the same. Appearance is only slightly tweaked (different jackets, hair styles, etc etc). I prefer the Security story line only because I like the appearance and dialog better. The story could have been more developed and more levels included, but I can't complain that much. I completed the campaign in a few hours. Replaying it has kept me occupied for a good while, however. Maybe it's jsut because I'm a simple person. My favorite aspect of the entire campaign and story is that you can play both sides and see how the story develops and progresses as you complete levels and objectives. Save the 'Ark' or destroy it.  OVERALL RATING: 8.8 out of 10. Polished game. Few bugs. Keeps you occupied for a while. Would have liked it to be longer and more in depth with more variation in gameplay. Brink is a good game for a good price.",

            "review_text": "I'm not going to say this game is the best multiplayer game out there right off the bat, because everyone is entitiled to their opinion. As 'Endeblez' said in his review, its not for everyone. But I believe that the reason for that is because its gameplay is incredibly different from any other shooter. Here's why:  It focuses on tactical teamwork &amp; objectives instead of little or no teamwork &amp; kill to death ratios. You gain experience not only from kills, but gradually from completing or defending objectives, or from claiming command posts from your opponents. There are 4 different classes that you can spawn as and switch between in-game. Rankings at the end of a match are calculated by how much experience you received in the match. They even list mvp's for each class &amp; overall at the end of a match.   The only game I can truely compare to BRINK is Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, both of which are made by Splash Damage &amp; on the id tech 4 engine. Basically, the only 2 features that separate these 2 games is BRINK's fluid movement controls &amp; ETQW's 'MegaTexture' Planet sized maps. Other than that, they are basically the same game.  Overall: 'My' opinion gives this game a 10/10 for gameplay, 8/10 for story, 10/10 for multiplayer (and yes, there are still people who play this game, and if theres no one in a server, there are always bots to fall back on.), and 9/10 for graphics (Mainly because its built on the id tech 4 game engine and they did an excellent job of modifying it to make it look modern.)  BUT that is my opinion, not your's. You need to form your own. This game is not for everyone, but it is a game you should at least try.  PS: This review can also count as a review on Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. I urge you to try both. However, If you don't like one, its likely you won't like the other, or vice versa.",

Refuel offers the most dynamic battles because players can ebb with combat easily and have time to set up. Other maps have objective points too close, or too far from spawn, making all those buffs you got for not if you can't make it to the objective in time, or you're getting spawn trapped.

Movement capabilities are really there. It's like almost only thing that you can't do is climb tall vertical walls. The rest is possible. Of course, my playing style is more 'close and personal', which caused me to choose Heavy body type which is... more...inert than Light body type... So, not that much climbing for me :D  Character customization, level ups, upgrades, weapons, weapon customization, class based gameplay is very well tuned, too :) Even now from time to time I am enjoying it with my Heavy Enforcer and a Gatling Gun (or something it is called...

This combined a large poster campaign with lack of availability to most players- by the time they could get the game by more normal means, it was already old hat, and the multiplayer servers full of tumbleweeds.   (The bots are dire- they fail hard at the objective-based gameplay, so human players are really the only fun option.)  It's a shame, it flowed beautifully, and the quirky parkour gameplay allowed for some stellar moments. Moral of the tale- don't sell your soul to a historical curio. This was a great game, totally screwed by stupid marketing antics.   I would still enjoy playing it, were the servers more populated- but probably would find it hard to recommend deliberately spending money on it. My copy came as part of a Quakecon pack, a few years ago.",

You have to move to the right to get around that railing and if you crouch your rifle will be at the railing height and thus won't hit the approaching enemies. So you move back into the building.   In Brink, you run towards the railing, drop down and slide underneath it, and empty your SMG into the enemy on the left. Coming to your feet and switching to your assault rifle you put three shots into the person on the right, then sprint forwards, leap towards a pipe attached to a shipping container and climb to the top. You run to the edge, jump down the two stories, hit the ground rolling and start again.  Fluid. Fast. If you took Assassins Creed and CoD then threw them into a jar and shook till it had fully merged. If you have ever cursed at your controls, if you have ever stopped playing because you can do it better, play Brink.",

Despite running on the Doom 3 engine (idTech 4), the game was a slow, stuttery, unstable mess. Graphical glitches abounded, with many ATi users reporting scan lines across their screen and sub-par performance to boot(I can attest to these glitches as I experienced both). Rather than fix the problem, Splash Damage tried to bury any evidence of complaints and only responded/fixed the majority of the issues after the potentially fun multiplayer component withered on the vine. The game is fixed now but no one plays it and no one ever will.  Splash Damage lost all credibility with me. Developers, when will you learn that responsible ownership for mistakes will always gain you more respect that a brazen money-grab? Good luck making minigames.  Avoid this title.  4/10.",
