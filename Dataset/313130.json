            "review_text": "It's exactly what it says on the tin and not a bit more. A stealth assassination game with permadeath and a wholly unnecessary unlock system to try to catch onto the roguelike trend.  There's not enough here though. It feels like a minigame, something you play to pass the time rather than genuinely exciting or tense. It's only hard if you don't have the patience to wait forever for each target to stumble into the clear and if you try to play it dangerously there's no fun at all because you just get gunned down instantly.  It reminds me of Noir Syndrome in all the worst ways only at least in Noir Syndrome the kludgy mechanics at least gave you a goal to work toward of solving the case. Here, everything is about getting more cash and buying any fun toys sets you back six or so boring contracts worth of cash.",

            "review_text": "I love the idea behind this game. It really takes the setting and genre and runs with them. It looks nice, the top-down artwork for the settings are well done, although the people are little more than multi-colored boxes stacked on top of each other. There's really not much in the way of music to talk about, but the sound effects are well done, which is always nice.   It's a little repetitive gameplay wise, but I actually find that fairly realistic. I think being a contract killer  would be  repetitive. You can't just go out and start shooting everything up either, you have to really take your time and plan out your moves, which I also find realistic. It's a fun, hard, game and definitely worth picking up.",

In Metrocide, you play a hitman, roaming the mean streets in order to get out of them. a lot of patience and planning is required because every place is monitored by cameras, police drones, eye witnesses and vigilanties. You can kill a target and get shot by a random citizen in the street.   This game may be harsh and punishing, but the satisfaction gained from getting your way up in the contract ladder is worth it. I highly recommend this game!",

            "review_text": "* Don't bother, even if it's on sale! *  I am all about the cyper-punk-noir art style and feel of the game, but it has serious issues:  - it is extremely poorly made; it tends to crash for no apprent reason, and the menu selection is not intuitive. For instance, if you select 'Full-Screen without also adjusting the resolution the game will run in the background without you being able to see it to make further adjustments - if you don't like a merciless trial-and-error process of figuring out a game, you'll probably just get frustrated, and quickly - the difficulty curve is bananas; - the unlock system really needs to be more transparent; - there should be an option to re-map keys; - there aren't even volume controls; - the game continues around you while you're locked in the shop/contract menus;   Beyond the issues with the mechanics, the game tends to crash from time to time, which is all the more annoying when it takes 25 minutes to take out 5 contracts. When autosaving doesn't work with the gameplay, you'd sure as hell better guarantee that you've got all stability issues covered. It doesn't matter how much you like the game when it works; when you've finally saved up enough cash for a Skycleaner and a Silenced Shotgun, and the game locks up upon leaving the shop menu, you're going to spam Ctrl+Alt+Del to get out, and write a review about the issues...  I'd previously said that 'I would really like to recommend this game, but I don't want to have the conversation about the prerequisite mindset necessary to actually enjoy playing it,' but that was when I thought it was a game. After trying time and again to try to either have fun or make progress in this accursed experience, I finally realized that it was actually a frustration generator disguised as a game, and were this available in a physical form, it too might end up in a landfill to be dug up by kids from the next generation who had heard the legend of the program that ruined many a space bar, and almost succeeded in breaking the human spirit before the coming Computer Wars.
