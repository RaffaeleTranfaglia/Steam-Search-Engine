The game's not perfect, but if it made me to spend more than 24 hours for it, it is a damn interesting game!  Advantages:  1) Huge map of Europe including a small part of Asia and northern Africa 2) Different types of strategy mixed in one game: TBS for political and economical desisions and RTS for war 3) Many different types of tactics, which depend on battlefield and armies 4) Good graphics quality (as for 2005)  Disadvantages:  1) Historically wrong setting (for example Poland was excluded from Russian Empire) 2) Some useless things you' never use (like cannons: they are really useless in this game) 3) Multiplayer is exesting, but there are no servers to support it anymore (but still you know, how to play online with other means, ha?)  9/10  A perfect game to spend a weekend!",

IT IS ON SALE FOR 0.99!!!!! I still have the dvd version from years ago, i played campaign with every fation, one of the few games i actually repllayed, if you get half the joy I did ou will still feel guilty for paying such a price....BUY IT!!",

I would definitely recommend this game, BUT this game sometimes just randomly crashes for me at least. Right after an important battle, BAM it crashes. Just built a complex trading route? Crash. Negotiated a treaty with France? Crash. This made me paranoid about saving. There is an autosave feature, but it rarely ever saves on its own. I feel there are better games in this genre, but i got it on sale for 2 bucks, which is about a bottle of soda and a bag of chips. If you do decide to purchase this, be sure to save after everything you do.",

So here are some pros and cons.  Pros:  1. Graphics(For its time) 2. Sound effects. 3. The battles are amazing, especially in the campaign. All units fire at the same time. 4. Physics on cannon balls(I always order my cannons to fire as far as they can) 5. Naval combat is just amazing! Cons: 1. Sometimes after a battle the game crashes(Please fix it, Im currently doing the same battle over and over again till it finally stops) 2. Nothing else!  All in all I would recommend this game to anyone!",

You have to save game A LOT! because it can crash any second , at loading screen or moving unit to next place or just pausing a game , main thing is to save A LOT because i did not few times , it crashed and 1 hour work was gone , and it has crappy autosave. Game in general is good , combat is so cool and clashes between units is awesome , map is huge , there isn`t any story , and it is expected, you just have to win all battles and take every territory. It has few modes like historical battles which are cool. Graphics for 2005 game are very cool , game is slow very slow at some times but it gets better after 1 hour of playing. This game crash thing ruins game very much but if you can fix it or learn how to not cause one or learn how to be careful it will be fine. Get the game now for 74 cents or wait for other sale.",

Anyone who has palyed the Total War games is going to enjoy this one. Yes it is a few years older and I had never heard of this game until the I purchased it, but as far as older games go this one has aged very well . Other than a few minor complaints about interface on the over world, looking at data and troop movement and placement, again I would say this one is well worth it. 8/10 for me.",

I sent two of my Colonels againts three of Austria's Captains, and I actually won. Then, while the game was loading, BAM! Crash. Lost the whole battle. Another time, I was playing as the French, and Prussia declared war on me. We had a gigantic fight that was even. It was loading, BAM! Blue screen. Most of the time, though, its just a normal 'Not Responding' crash. I got it on sale for $.99, and even after all the crashes, I still love it. After all the crashing, I will still reccomend it.",

I had a lot of fun with the original game until this problem got worse as the game progressed, and I was more or less driven off. I love this game for so many different aspects of its design, mostly the simplicity as I think its a good intro to this type of game - but especially its naval combat as I used to love being a single ship and taking on a fleet, running rings round them. Its a lot of fun, but these issues need sorted.  I suppose at 80p I can't really grumble.",

I must say that I wasn't expecting much, hearing reviews from the Total War forums, but man, I was wrong. This game is FUN. You have to make hard decisions both on/in the map and the battles. It is really hard in the beginning, but once you gain a foothold and some infantry and cavalry, you're good to go.   Quick Tips  Windows 7/8/8.1 users, if you're running a display above 1024x768 (I think), and you're sent back to your desktop after starting this up, go to config.sb in Imperial Glory's folder and change 'Fullscreen True' to 'Fullscreen false,' then set the compatibility mode to Windows XP SP2, that should fix the problem.  Cavalry can destroy your infantry extremely quickly, which until you gain the Square Formation to repel them, will happen often.   Militia is really hard to counter in the beginning with your first Gunpowder infantry, mix your Gunpowder infantry with militia to help you.  Use buildings, you can kill an army 2x your size just by being in a garrison.  Don't fight wars unless you're certain you can destroy the enemy nation, you'll find yourself in a stalemate even if you have enough troops.  USE DIPLOMACY        ",

To stop this game from ever crashing and aborting your life dreams of risk + total war. 1. Go to Library 2. Right click Imperial Glory and select Properties 3. Go to Local Files and click Browse Files 4. Right click ImperialGlory.exe (i.e. ImperialGlory with icon next to it) and select properties 5. Go to the compatibility tab.

It requires careful strategies both in battle and out, and I think it is really cool how they have an AI controlling the independant countries other than the 5 empires.   In battle on easy mode, even if you are the attacker, the AI will ALWAYS attack you. It can glitch out sometimes and do dumb stuff within the battle. The lack of moral for units in battle is kinda cheap, as you can literally command units to death. But it is pretty smart when it comes to managing the other countires aganst you, and will not hesitate to attack your weaknesses.
