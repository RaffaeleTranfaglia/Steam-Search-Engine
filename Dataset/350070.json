I've been through nearly 5000 games on my recomendations queue, and I've only been barely interested enough in 200 of them to put on my wishlist.  If you're like me, and completely jaded by misleading tags, lack of gameplay in trailers, early access games that have been abandoned, ( A flood of RPGMaker, visual novels, poorly drawn anime dating sim, choose your own destiny, point and click, simulation, 'survival horror', etc.) games that you are unable to filter out!!! (seriously steam, why the **** can't I filter this trash out?!)... Then your poor brain deserves this.  **Edit: Dear LORD of ALL that is HOLY and good in the universe, they've added a filter to the recommendations queue!! Thank you Lord Gaben!   The point is, this game is a deep breath of fresh air in an ocean of complete excrement.   +tight controls +FULL controller support, even allowing you to use the D-pad or the left thumb stick for movement. So I don't understand the 'Partial controller support' on the game's features. (And you bet your *** I'm using the XBox One Controller's D-Pad) +rewarding discoveries +brilliant and appropriate music +awesome boss battles +extended end game content  -there aren't enough talented people making games for Steam  Buy it at FULL price, because it's already being sold short!",

The amount of secrets, the amount of interesting areas and bosses, the very, very mysterious but intriguing plot. It's all you can ask for. Buy this game, you won't regret it. 10/10  update: ALSO THE END GAME. youre save file shows percentage completion to 100%. what the game doesn't tell you, is you can bring the save file to 200+% completion with hidden end game content. the puzzles are nuts. super fun.",

I've got great news, everyone; this game is fantastic and exactly what you're looking for. Great graphics that never seem repetitive or dull, nice atmospheric music setting the tone for each level, plenty of power-ups that aren't boring or derivative, level-progression that requires you to explore and never feels guided or linear, a bunch of challenging and fun bosses, and more than 10 hours of content for a blind playthrough.  Not only is it good to see the platformer/action-adventure genre get some love, but it's great to see such a charming and genuine example such as this game. Whether it's on sale or not, you wouldn't regret supporting this game.",

It's honestly one of the best games I've gotten off of Steam. It's fun as a completionist, but then there's also a bizarre metagame that goes beyond 100% if you want to take it further.  What I love about some of the indie metroidvania games is that they learn from a lot of the mistakes of the classics. This one does exactly that. The combat is fun, the puzzles are engaging, and the exploration is satisfying. Buy it! Play it! Right now!",

Everything about this game screams 'NES metroid', but in a new and refreshing way. All the mechanics are handled well, the controls respond smooth and overall the timing in some stages with minute motions is executed flawlessly. No bugs, no errors, no weird glitches, multiple endings, a wide array of authentic and new upgrades and a solid backstory.  The music is superb and really captures the surroundings in a way it feels like it was actually happening. The theatrical elements and overall light forced storytelling really made me want to explore for it, and that's the best possible outcome.  From enemy variety, to puzzle difficulty, to other elements vital in such a game, this one checks them all off.  Overall i rate this game 9.5/10. The only major gripe i had was that there's a minor amount of screen stepping when moving with high speed through some areas. That alone isn't a dealbreaker, it's just not something i personally like. Everything else is solid and i highly advise you to give this one a good try :)  TL:DR. If you're a fan of anything metroid or castlevania or just in the mood for a challenging game, then this is absolutely worth picking up.",

As an adult, that doesn't happen too often anymore, but this game did it for me.  It's an action platformerâ lot's have compared it to metroid, I never played metroid but it does remind me of megaman. It's a very challenging game, and I think that's why I love it so much. It's hard, but not in a cheap, game-broken way.   The boss fights are no joke. I had to retry many many times before I beat each one. The platforming can get pretty difficult too; I drove myself crazy trying to get through certain segments, but it got easier with time. The game makes you work hard to excel at it, and when you do, it feels awesome.  Also, there're some hidden power ups near the end that turn the whole game into a cakewalkâ if you're willing to go through hell and back to get them.  Last note: the soundtrack is amazing. I never got bored listening to it. So many memorable tunes.  ",

Be aware, however, that this game is challenging. It's not super hard, but you won't be able to just stumble your way through it. Some skill is required. The game has a nice, smooth learning curve to it, but ultimately you'll just have to git gud. Also, if you're stuck at a boss, it's possible you missed an upgrade somewhere.

But sadly the game just continues to confuse and annoy me that I no longer want to complete it anymore. I quit at the part where some enemies were following you on the Y axis in the Volcano area, next to a room with fireball spitting Piranha plants.  =============  Its  good  aspects: - It is aesthetically a nice game, very loyal to the 8-bit graphics I liked with NES games. - It has a nice soundtrack and atmosphere, it really felt like a Metroid inspired game. - The boss battles I did were fun, you may need to learn a pattern, but they were fun to play.  =============  But, its  bad  aspects:  - It is a difficult game, you dont have a lot of health. The enemies and the environment tend to do a lot of damage later in the game. You can crank up your HP by editing the game's config, but I think the ingame upgrades should do this.  - It is a cryptic game, I often did not know what I had to do in order to progress. At first the game helps out with messages on ingame computers, but later on I often had the feeling I was missing certain items in order to progress like a vertical boost jump. I spent a lot of time looking for a fourth energy source in the Temple area, it turned out you had to move through a wall to get to it. I had to look on a YouTube video to figure this one out, that area just looks too much like a plain wall. In Metroid, a Zoomer (enemy) would have crawled along the wall and disappeared inside the hidden part to give a hint. If it were for a secret item like the disks, it would be fine. But not in order to progress in the storyline.  - It is a hard platformer, where you really need to master the hookshot jumps to get where you need to go. Too often I get knocked off by Rinka enemies, falling stalagtites or projectiles and drop into acid or lava. It just becomes annoying after too many times. However, some people may think this is where the challenge of the game is and consider it a good point.  - It is not very rewarding, I think it would have been better if boss battles rewarded you with upgrades rather than having to search for them. Also the heat suit kind of disappointed me, I need it just to get through a few areas. The Metroid Varia suit, deducts damage done from enemies and allows you to walk in lava. Also, killing enemies become a bit of a chore, they do not drop anything usefull like health.  =============  Because of these points I do not recommend this game to other players. Im just a casual gamer however and people with more skill and patience probably will find this game enjoyable. I really wanted to like this game inspired by Metroid, but it just became too difficult and cryptic for me to keep up with it.",
