It would be great if we have regulated matches based on K/D ratio or something.) -No Asian server (I truly have a strong wish that we have JPN server for this good game.)  I mainly play PvP and some say it's nothing but camping and spawnkilling. Still, sometimes we have good, intense matches. Though this game has quite a few flaws to fix, I believe Warface is one of the best free to play FPS on Steam.",

THEIR MINES MAKES ME CRAZY! - You need good teammates if you want to survive PvE or Operations.  - Bad matchmaking system over 13 lvl. You can matchup with 80 lvl players and they beat the crap out of you.  - There is plenty of bad players who has %50 headshoot rate... Luck is overloaded.  Download it. If you ever gonna pay. Pay for VIP. Good luck, have fun.",

I have used only the deafult weapon's ( stock ) and i was still able to fight without any problems agains the high lvl player with huge equipment = NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME = POSITIVE SUPRISE FOR ME  Negative: The only problem so far what actually is really boring is this litle Micro stuttering 'lag' by moving the mouse around the map , this can easily makes you to miss the head of the enemy by a fail of the game not becouse your aim bad = this is not enjoyable.  ( This must be fixed )  and what i not like is that only a fev guns/equipments etc etc you can buy by playing the game and get $ to buy them , most of them you can only buy with reall money , but this is normall for a free to play game , so far i can kill them i can live with that  Didn't played alot , just started but so far i shoot 8/10 for this game MP &amp; Coop , but coop is much more funn for me!",

Warface is a co-op game and also pvp I has several game modes for pvp Team deathmacht , storm , Plant the bomb , Capture , and you get daily co-op missions and if you complete thos missions you get crowns now i wont get to mucht detail about the crowns but basically if you complete a mission you will get a kill points score and the time that you got on that mission and depending how well your team did you get different reward.  Co-op is a great part of the game thats what i mostly play on this game its great with friends and then you got thos interactions with players that you never see on other games even battlefield for example sliding now sliding can sometimes get annoying because its hard to hit them sometimes but its also fun and then you got the climbing on this theres certain areas you can achive by you and friend helping each other up ther you can decide just to boost your friend and stay down ther or you can both go up .  Finaly you got special operations i havent tried yet i only did cyber horde and its awsome really hope to see more content for that but other special operations are Tower raid and Operation: Cold peak .  But no game is perfect sometimes you get small lag issues or it takes some time to load the game or the round and then you will hear the usual people complaning about shotguns ( shotguns are not op dont worry ) and camping and yada .  But overrall i really love this game its great i ain´t mucht of a pvp i mostly play about 4 to 5 rounds of pvp then like the 6 co-op missions.  About hackers its not full of hacker Crytec got the fairfight system now the game is more clean . Overall i give this game about an 9/10 i really recomend play this game.",

You can't compare this to ARMA 3, or Counterstrike, or CoD because two of those are $60 games. This however, is free.  The cash shop is similar to other free to play games, you get cash semi-slowly (to urge you to buy the other cash) to buy and maintain equipment, but if you are really good or just play a lot you can get the best gear using crowns a currency obtained through co-op play, it only lasts a short while (I think seven days or so) but it's much better than anything else, in turn making it easier to get even more crowns. Then there are special weapons that are better than the basic versions that only last for a week or so, but they are better and some are event themed, The world cup tournaments, Christmass, and other holidays don't exactly last forever you know. They basic guns are permanent.  The (co-op) maps are narrow to kind of guide the player through what is next as opposed to having them run in circle saying where am I going. I do not play multiplayer yet so I don't know anything about that, but the co-op is fun and later it is challenging, but if you can't do the skilled level you can go back to the regular and get more stuff then later get good enough to do skilled.  The games graphics actually look good. I don't know why some say they are bad, again it's free to play I guess nobody like realm of the mad god because if these grapics are bad I feel bad for that games reviews. Yes they do saymade with cryteks cry enginebut it looks good for a free to play, heck it looks good for a pay game even, but hey if they are bad you can go and desing better graphics and give the developers that. So have fun with that. The game looks like it's from July 1, 2014.  Yes the game is still in beta at the time I'm making this, and granted 'its been in beta for one year now and the same problems exist now as they did back then' That doesn't mean they cant be fixed. They may not be fixed, but they can be. Plus there is the fact that there aren't many 'bad' things about the game. The only bad things I can think of is that there is a special tab with nothing ever in it, that I've found yet, There aren't a ton of guns there a okay amount but I want more, and the repair system, I feel like that will annoy me. Other than those though it's a good game, and I'd recommend it.",

It's a mixed of Crysis and Call of Duty. Made by Farcry and Crysis both together. The game has some negative aspects, but there's always a positive part that hooks you into this game.

Its a little jittery at times and some of the lag glitching issues could be addressed such as getting pinned by the game into a set point and having to leave the server but this happens very rarely.  The match making lobby where you sit to join other fighters is impressive, simplle and clear also here the weapon of choice / play style of choice doesnt seem to update which kit your using unless you play assualt class but again has no real baring on your actual gameplay value.  Available maps and modes make for a very interesting game with the cooperative need for upto 5 players to work together to complete the first missions however if some of the players are weaker this is easily acheivable with some good team work and use of the chat function, a very highly reccomended game to try and free what more could you ask for :D",

There are 3 different types of games to play and I know at least two are fun. (versus and co-op) There are some 'pay to win' apects like buying guns for real money, but it's not too big of a deal.   COMPLAINTS:  -Segregation of players by rank. For example: When one of my friends played more than us, he was separated into the 'pro' category for the versus mode. Now me and my other friend have to play by ourselves, alone, until we reach a high enough rank to play with my friend. -Hacking galore. Aim bots. They'll suddenly jerk to a new direction and land heashot on my whole team. (I have video evidence. Over 20 minutes.) -Tons of microtransactions. -Takes MANY hours to earn in-game money. -Prices for guns. -Co-op mission capping. When rank 1-8 you can only play two missions. -There are three different in-game currencies. They should make this one or two. Three is TOO MANY.  GOOD THINGS: -Fun when not dying. -Great controls. -A deep game that you and your friends can play. -Researching guns to get them for lower prices. -Easy friend to game connectivity. -You can vote to ban players. -Can report players abusing the game. -Great Engine  Suggestions: -Adding a way to preview a gun in the safe house before buying it.  In conclusion, this game is very fun if you don't have hackers in your lobby, and you're willing to invest a LOT of time. Overall this game gets a 7/10 (nearly 6/10) because of hackers.",

            "review_text": "It's really a good game, if you can excuse the server infrastructure, and can play long enough to realize it isn't pay-to-win.  I'll preface this on the pay-to-win: The weapons are priced with Kredits only (the microtransaction) because you haven't unlocked them. If you want the weapon, there are vendors in the game where you gain equipment to purchase with the in-game currency. You select from one of three and you play a match. Your match performance puts progress towards both your rank and vendor of choice. When you complete a vendor, you get the reward they presented you with. For weapons and outfit, you will have to buy it, but it's unlocked to purchase with the in-game currency. For accessories, you get them straight-out and can equip them to the weapon they support.  It's called a progression system. Play the game, make progress. I've been in the closed beta since it was accepting invites, I know the game.  Otherwise, it runs well enough, the controls are decent, and most everything can be bound to anything (previously, my Mouse4 and 5 couldn't be bound, but as of the Steam release, I can). The graphics are nice, but forgive Crytek for not knowing how video settings work, which disappoints a little seeing as it's a PC title.  Gunplay is nice, the implementation of teamplay is smooth, although it isn't emphasized much in the maps. Speaking of, the maps are smaller than Medal of Honor's multiplayer (which was smaller than CoD, basically). You can play versus, which is where the meat of the game seems to exist, but there's a co-op mode that uses the classes well.  So yeah...  Pros - Good gunplay, teamplay, co-op is fun, versus is fun, most of the stuff is affordable when you're putting out good games.  Cons - Servers tend to be laggy almost always, maps are small, lackluster graphics settings, and vague description of the progression system, giving it this false indication that it's a Pay-to-win title when it's not.",

If you play it like as a premium game then money could be better spent but you will get a lot more enjoyment out of it. Pve missions are really fun when you get a well balanced group that isnt selfish with support, but this brings me to the cons of the game. Its hard to get a balanced team unless you already play a match or grab a group of friends a chat before a private match, this is because there is no server browser and you are thrown into a game without knowing which class to pick, so sometimes it can be a game full of only snipers or assaults and you get slaughtered, on a side note the game is generous with premium respawn tokens if you want to respawn early to save the game. this game is largely freemium but is very playable if you dont want to spend money. Graphics and optimization, This game is actually pretty well optimized and can easily run 40-60 fps on a cheap or older computer on medium settings. It looks decent, not too pretty but the map and level designs are very intuitive. The only major problem I have with the graphics is that no matter what I change in graphics or even my nvidia control panel there is a very ugly type of blur, even after turning motion blur off you can see after frame trails of your weapon and anything near you, but its not that bad and its pretty easy to get used to. I was starting to get very bored but then I learned they change their levels up. Even though the game asks for money in a lot of places I have to give some respect on the fact they are very generous with free items at the start and level up to give a boost to you if you are having a tough time getting some decent gear. Overall I enjoy it, Im not too fond of the pvp as the level and gamemode selection is pretty small and it can get boring fast. Its definitly something to enjoy playing here and there but you will normally get bored then have to wait for some different levels.",

If your hardcore enough and can play weith a group of friends then this is definitly some fun to be involved in, graphics are pretty sweet too for what it is.. I would recommend this to a friend it's nice to be able to jump on co-op/multi but it's only a matter of time before the blacklisters go in and kill it for the rest..

These levels start off easy and work up to hardcore with 'The Tower' map being Hardcore survival for 19 rounds i think, Whereas 19 rounds doesnt sound like much it does get tricky as you play.   Warface also comes with the normal TDM multiplayer maps which is great to if you like this. I am for one more into the coop pve side of warface. Highly recommend to give it a decent shot.

Snipers run around like a heavy with a shotgun and engineers are basically a CQB rifleman. The classes aren't very different and need to be fixed. Second buying items. Buying items is so annoying, most items you can only buy for a few days, WHICH SUCKS! PLEASE REMOVE THAT. Third the guns. Most of the guns look stupid and you made the starter gun an m4. I think there should be different versions of the m4 instead of just the LMG and the starter gun. Like in real life the millitary uses m4s but in this game the m4 is the worst gun. The fourth problem is communication. I know there is voice chat but no one really knows about it. There are problems in this game that i haven't thought of so i am ending it here.",

            "review_text": "I have a mixed opinion about the game. While it can be a fun enough game, there's a fair amount of cons that ruin the fun. I do and don't recommend this game, and here's why :  Pros : -Guns don't completely overpower one another -The game keeps you going by having to unlock things -Most Co-Op missions are swapped out daily -Fair amount of upgrades for your character -Co-Op requires a good amount of teamwork *This also means that the team has to consist of at least 3 of the 4 classes with a team of 3^, if you want to be successful -Easy-to-use controls -Actions are easy to do and are beneficial  Cons : -Co-Op isn't that great, gets boring after the first few co-op missions *The game requires players to play Co-Op to unlock some new gear -Most weapons require real money to keep permanently, instead of 1, 7, or 30 days -PvP isn't very fun after a while due to various reasons: *People dropshot too often *Spawn camping is insane *Medics serve little purpose in PvP since you can respawn right after death *Maps are incredibly small, disabling a need for any tactical play *Snipers are rendered useless on almost every map, due to the small map size -Co-Op gets to be a bit repetitive -Great weapons are cheap, allowing new players to get an amazing weapon *This is both a pro and a con, but listed under con because it takes away some of the purpose of Co-Op -Medic is used more for close quarters rather than reviving teammates *The medics are equipped with a shotgun, while other classes aren't  Overall, I would recommend this game to anybody who's played Fps's (First-Person-Shooters) such as CoD when it was good (Before MW3 in my opinion), Battlefield, and Rainbow Six. Don't expect the game to be amazing, for me it's more a game to play when I'm bored with nothing else to do.I've been playing this for MONTHS and I have to say it's one of the BEST Co-Op games i've ever played with my friends since Left 4 Dead 2! I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys those types of games that force you to work together along with other live players!noobs be like : pay to win. me be like : pay to not grind and the grind for me was like 20 hrs or less  i don't care if there are weapons you need to buy to be 'better'.... because i can do good with the stock weapons (Default weps) . If you play a while ( for me it took 20 hrs as i said , not too much) you can unlock and buy weapons with your own money (money from playin' stuff) , which are pretty the same with the ones you buy with real money .   cons :  - i hate dem shotguns -sometimes, hackers can ruin your match , either if they are on your team ( stealing kills , no points ) or in the enemy team ( killing you non stop , your k/d rate will blow up ) , but you can kick them if you have lucky teammates which hates hackers too  pros:  -now it has a new gamemode between co op and versus ( capture , storm , death match , team death match and others ) they introduced survival with a few missions with link between them ( the final from one is logic and makes sense with the beginning of the next mission ) which is pretty good . -good for playing with friends ( co op , survival ) or alone (versus)  edit : looks like they noticed a lot of negative reviews and they made a major change: a part of this called 'pay to win' , has a name 'crown money' , which fortunately are available for all players now . How so ? Well you can get them from daily insane missions ( there are 3 types : easy , hard , insane) or by playing co op with friends (there are some parameters like : if u did the most kills or a lot of kills you will get some of those crown money , and if you and your squad manage to do the mission in a short time, again you will get crown bonus) . But that's not all. You get crown money when you lvl up, and this is quite nice, in my opinion.  Another pro thing : Speaking of leveling up, when you level up you get a 3 hours VIP booster, which means u will get exp bonus , money bonus , and vendors exp bonus ( there is a list of common , rare , and very rare weapons , and vendors exp when you level up on vendors u get a random weapon from those common , rare and very rare )   Overall, they made the game better, i mean u can buy vip weapons without spending a penny, but you don't need to, if you are good with the normal weapons. I recommend this game : 8/10 ",

Warface is a bit different, more you kill... more money you get. Premium things are quite cheap and durable. 8/10   Playable ?  The game is a wonderful mix of Call of Duty Series with Combat Arms and Crysis... Fast, Reliable, Wonderful Graphics, Optimized, Nice Controls... 10/10  Connection ?  This is the weakest point of the game... There aren't dedicated servers in the game. Connections are peer to peer like game-consoles... 5/10  Conclusion   Awesome alternative to Call of Duty series.

PvP is even worse then CoD, just running around with a gun or throw granades. Reminds me from Combat Arms.  It isn't P2W as people claim to be. Most weapons are free to acquire, only some are paid. But they've been balanced out to the free weapons (unlike Ghost Recon: Phantoms (yes I'm still mad at that game).  So yeah, just download this game and play the Co-Op with some friends or in a public lobby. Its worth it as long you dont touch PvP.",

Warface has been out for a while so when I got the chance to play it on Steam, I went for it. Overall the game feels like it was built with team play, and tactical thinking in mind, with each class having a 'specialty' or role to fill. What we got however was not so much that game.   If you play Warface like a frantic arena shooter you will have more fun than trying to be 'tactical' and specialize roles with your teammates. Its much easier, and overall more fun to just rush into combat and shoot everyone, you'll get more xp and its a lot faster than trying to fill your role. An example I can give of this is my time playing as a medic. I was always at the ready, trying to heal my team, but it was hard when they would keep running away from you, while you try to heal them. Trying to revive a teammate with chest paddles was even harder, most of the time they would just opt to respawn instead of waiting the extra second or so for me to finish the animation for the revive. I was only ever able to save about one in ten teammates while playing as a medic. I also must point out that as a medic, you are one of the most brutal classes in the game, you can rush in to battle with a shotgun and easily kill 5 guys, self heal up, and then rush back in to kill five more. The respawn times are fast in most game modes so there is not that much of a reason to play it 'safe'.   Overall I like warface, it looks great and it plays pretty average for a free to play shooter. The biggest draw back for me is the cash shop, making there a possibility for huge pay to win, and that really the game is just an arena shooter under the skin of a modern fps. Get ready to run, hipfire your gun, kill five guys, die and do it all again! Its fun, but you may get bored easily. I think that you should at least try the game after all its free, what can it hurt?",

Guns feel weak and generally you have to pump 10-20 rounds into a target before going down. Take it for what it is...this is the game version of those pulpy sci fi type action flicks you watch on a saturday afternoon when it's pouring with rain. It's stupid fun.   The co-op is improved (like most games) hugely with a good team. They have tried to do some neat things to encourage team work (buddy climbing etc).   This game is not pay to win (at least not in co-op) which is nice. Other weapons can be bought with real world money or in game xp type rewards however a great deal of new gear, guns etc can only be rented.  Visually the game is built on cryengine but has clearly been downscaled so it can be used on a large number of platforms. It's not super ugly but definately doesn't have some of the graphical flair and post processing fx of even the original Crysis.   Levels are generally small and tight and the edges of the maps are often crudely done (basic box skyscrapers with low res textures spring to mind).  Grab this game as a free to play distraction especially if you have some buddies that like co-op. Generally though the community seems pretty good, even if they don't speak much.  I keep thinking this game is meh but then it keeps drawing me back for 30mins or so to play it.  Overall if you are into co-op give this one a try, why not it's free right?  p.s. just played versus it's fun kind of in the COD mode of things, nothing ground breaking.  6.5/10",

I was used to the futuristic weaponry in Crysis so being able to use more modern weaponry that I actually recognized was a good chance.   I booted up my first game and the first thing I noticed was the somewhat hectic team deathmatch and free-for-all games. The guns were easy to control and once you learn how to press F to slide, the game is over.

            "review_text": "  THIS GAME IS IN OPEN BETA! FEATURES WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE AND SO WILL MY REVIEW!     Warface is an amazing Free to Play game. As much as I see people disagreeing on this topic, I do not believe that WF is Pay2Win but rather Play2Win. In Warface, you have ranks such as Cadet, Private, Corporal, Sergeant, and more. The higher your rank the more stuff you can get for a lower price and better guns at that. Now, with this out of the way, we can get on to the review.  Graphics: 7.5/10  The graphics of Warface are beautiful. Just straight-up fancy, spectacular graphics and beautiful to admire and play and immerse yourself into the world of war... that is, unless you have a high performance computer. See, the game has amazing graphics. Blood, bullets, even motion blur and the realism and rust of the guns. The downside is that it takes up a TON of performance and can lead to unplayability, making this the reason why the score is 7.5. Yes, nowadays there are great computers out there. However, many of them cannot stand the intensity of the graphics, thus causing a lack in FPS. The only way to enjoy the game without FPS lag if you have a bad computer is simply to turn the graphics settings as low as possible and try to enjoy low graphics settings.  Mechanics: 7/10  Mechanics play a huge part in the gaming industry, so people focus a ton of their time to make the game run as smooth as possible and to make things seem as realistic as possible. Warface did a really nice job of this. However, there are flaws that are noticable and can wreck other people's view of the game. Let's start with the health and armor set up.    Health and Armor are a needed feature in modern day FPS games and it is important for those features to work properly and to be as fair as possible. With Warface, the team made this game to seem like a Call of Duty type game. So, instead of having precentages and numbers, they just put 2 bars, one indicating health and the other is armor. Of course, this does not really matter with some gamers. What does matter is 'does these work?', and the answer is 'Sort of'. Why? The damage system simply needs a few tweaks is all. The damage is extremely varied. For example, at a 1 meter range with a SMG, it may do, say, 54 damage to the head. Using the same SMG at the same range shooting the head could be 34 the next time. Also for Call of Duty lovers, no regenitive health. 'Nuff said about that. Let's talk about the hitmarker. The hitmarker was a really cool feature they added in. You may be thinking 'Well, hitmarkers aren't that cool, they just show if you hit the person'. You are absolutly correct. However, that is not the case with Warface. The WF Team took it a step further and made it a damage indicator as well as a hit marker. The bigger the   X   is, the more damage you dealt in the bullet you shot. Sometimes, the   X   would 'fill up' as you may put it. There is a maximum for that   X   to fill up, which means that if you hit that maximum, it was an instant kill. That feature itself deserves a 10/10. There is one thing wrong with it, however: It sometimes doesn't give you the right information, but all in all, that hitmarker is one step closer to the future of gaming. Now, let's talk about the movement mechanics   It gets really irritating when your charactor cannot sprint for more than 2 seconds (Combat arms, I am looking at you...) or can't move faster than a snail (Again, combat arms...). Warface does an exellent job with the movement mechanics. Climbing and Sliding are very smooth and fluid. However, you can't climb most easily climbable objects that you could in real life. What I mean is, you cannot climb many things. You can climb through windows, slide through cracks in the wall, and more, but not up that rail that is juuuuust out of arms reach. But, to fix this, Warface did another amazing thing: they made it possible for teamates to 'boost' each other up. Of course, this is useless in Free For All, but it does work fluidly and is used by me all the time.   This game also has a Ranking feature, which works decently. There are challenges to complete. The more you complete, the more you rank up and the more things you can use to customize your emblem/name backround. Much like COD. That's all there is to this section.     Let's talk about the voice chat. This is the section that is the most flawed, and you can totally notice it. If you use your mic in this game, it cuts out, gets scratchy, or doesn't work at all. Also, the most annoying thing is, it feels like no one can understand you, no one can even hear you, and   doesn't have a mic to respond with   . I swear, people who type on your team can't get any more aggrivating. Half your team types and you're left with yourself and maybe a few other people on your team that type and get type killed. The rest hide in a corner to type and are of no use to you at all. Voice chat is a fail in this game. You cannot even use it in the lobby, because guess what:   You have to type   . This section brought down the mechanics section of this review.  Balance: 8/10  Of course, anyone who pays for a game will get a boost in their gameplay. But not by a lot in Warface. In Warface, I barely got started yesterday, and I am rising through the ranks and I have not even bought a gun yet. That's right, all this game needs is some skill and you are good to go! That is not the case, of course, with payers. They can buy boosts of cash and even though they don't win, they can buy enough boosts that ensure that they don't have to. It doesn't make sense if someone on the losing team gets bottom of the lobby (last place) but still gets more money than the 1st place winner on the winning team. That's what brought this part down. All in all, you just need skill, a good computer, and a gun (by that I mean the one you start with. That's all you need, really). Once you start rising in cash, you can buy a permanant gun for about $15,000 or less (sometimes, a good gun costs more, like ARs and Shotguns). On guns you buy for perm, however, you will need to keep repairing it, or else you cannot use it anymore. It's kinda like Upkeep, which in my opinion makes this game sorta like a tycoon game where you have to tend to your guns, but to me that is not a problem. Good armor is also good too. Now to the good part. Everyone who unlocks engineer gets claymore-happy. But chances are, they won't know how to use them right. They will place them in plain sight and unless you are careless, you can shoot it easy-peasy. This is not the case with experienced players (rank 5+, but even then they may not be experienced). Sometimes, clays get really annoying really fast, especially when people spawn-camp with them. Now that is the irritating part of this game. The maps are tiny (for now) and people tend to spawn-camp. Chances are, they die really quick afterwards. You get 3 second invulnerability, so that's a plus. Killcam is another cool thing to exploit. If you base knowlage ex post facto, you know exactly how to take any kind of camper down. With me, that's a little tricky. But, I will leave that up to you. Hopefully, you can play with me and learn a bit.  Overall Score: 8.5/10  Warface is an astonishing game that Gface made and I highly reccomend that you get this game and try it out for yourself and see how you think of the game. I hope this review helped you decide weather or not to try this game out. Remember, it IS in open beta, so things will change greatly. And when they do, I will be here to change my review. So long gamers.",

It's not as realistic as games like Battlefield, but it sure is a load of fun. The campaign doesn't really have much of a story to it, but that's kinda what I like about it. The campaign mode consists of co-op missions, that you play with real players online.  I also love how it has a bunch of multiplayer modes, including Team Deathmatch and Free-For-All, which are my two all times favorites. The gameplay is pretty immersive, and full of features.  Overall, A wonderful game for those who don't want to pay $30-$60 for a good quality FPS game.",

PVP is just P2W players and new players and it is not always fun. This game has a lot of fun for a F2P game in the Co-op mode, which I would rank similar to the L4D survivor mode.

If your going against a better team they will push you back to your spawn and kill you repeatedly. Not to mention the fact that im only level 2 and it placed me with very high levels, but this experience could be different for you. #2-The co-op part of the game where you team up with 5 other players and complete missions is very fun. I havent really seen anything wrong with it at all. I recommend playing it with friends. Also a little side note, i noticed if your a low level and you play co-op with higher level player an you get more kills than them like i dont know 70 kills and they have 15, they will most likely kick you for cheating.

I found this game a lot of fun when I'm bored of cs:go or any other games I usually play. While the level design is very unoriginal and also has some extremely bad spawn points in several maps, it has some very fast paced and enjoyable (just like cod, which is generally a good thing) gameplay which can be achieved without spending a single penny.",

I'm glad I didn't make the foolish decision to judge the game entirely on double DRM and throw it down instantly.  What awaited me when I finally got in was an instant classic ... for a free-to-play. Although the objective of each level is mostly the same as what you'd find in the average multiplayer mode of any game, it's definitely more fluid and somewhat more enjoyable. On Co-op, the AI is tailored perfectly to the ability of each player; it's not too dumb like in the early Battlefield games, nor is it ridiculously overclocked like in Loadout. Teamwork is imperative to the survival of the squad, much unlike ninety five-percent of the other MMOFPS games I've played recently (PlanetSide 2 for one), and it's very well optimised. In fact, the only real downside is that enemy bullets (in Co-op anyway) do too little damage to matter to a well-organised fireteam, and rushing the enemy head on seems to be an IWIN button. At least, for the levels titled Initiation - I haven't played much further than that.",

Pros: - Free to play (no cost for the quality)  - Solid FPS game, that allows you to upgrade your items (weapons, armor, etc)  - Multiplayer (though lack of cohesiveness among squadmates suck)  - 4 classes of soldiers (type,specialty,weapon type): RIFLEMAN, ammo resupply, rifle; MEDIC, revive, shotgun; ENGINEER, quickest bomb plant/deacitvate, smg; SNIPER, no special, sniper rifle. You can mix and match and none are required. In essence you can all be snipers or rifleman, but does come in handy to have a rifleman and medic on your team.  - New maps regularly  - Bonuses just for playing daily (cash which you keep or free weapons temporary such as a day, 3 days, etc)  - Can earn weapons or armor doing missions (you get to pick what you work towards out of 3 choices)  Cons:  - Two seperate currencies one earned during mission/matches, other purchased with real money (will explain next). Wish they would allow it stay the way it is (for those who want it) but have a reasonable all in price as I'm old school like that and would prefer to buy a game outright and have everything.  - Pay to win in PvP, as you need to spend real money to purchase the best weapons permenantly (with kreds) otherwise with cash earned you can only 'rent' them for a certain amount of time. As far as I can tell, may be wrong and just haven't played long enough. In essence you can earn enough cash to purchase the standard weapons and rent the best.   - Also have to pay to repair weapons. To me not a bad thing (as it adds some realism) just adds to the grind.  - Menu is convoluted (complicated) in some respects. Such as to go back to the previous screen after checking your inventory click 'play' right next to 'Warface'. Took me a little bit to realize it.  - This one isn't for me but I've seen complaints of people being automatically kicked out of mission/matches for high latency (ping). This is good as nobody wants lag (Devs: maybe also try to match latency along with skill/chosen match instead of kicking.  Summary: It's a solid free to play game, but I can see where it turns into a pay to win in PvP. Only regular items are available to buy with in-game currency that you can earn (as far as I can tell). As for the best items you have to spend real money to get what they call Kreds to be able to get them (maybe it's just sooner this way). It's a solid PvE (co-op) game that's once you get used to it is a joy to play.",

I don't like how you require so many hits to kill an enemy (they even have headshot protecting gear, which in fact costs quite a bit of ingame currency to buy) - Lag in PVP and PVE, sometimes hits don't seem to register or just generally makes aiming harder. - Too limited and somewhat unprecise movement - Costy equipment and guns in the store - It has modern browser FPS graphics, the same as in beta some years back. - Missions can get repetitive - Requires you to create a GFACE account.

Crytek have tried to make this game fast paced, although having to MANUALLY switch to grenades (and even a knife) only causes quick deaths and lost points. The difference between players and the lag between one soldier and another is annoying, this occured in Call of Duty: Black Ops where i could put 15-20 rounds into someone only to have them one shot me in a milisecond (according to my screen).   The game is riddled with microtransactions (like all F2P games though), which can suck up more money that you can shake a stick at. The control scheme is typical of all FPS's, simple but effective.  Overall, the game is ok but doesnt do anything different, it's an FPS with nothing special to it, it doesnt throw any wildcards or have anything hidden up its sleeve.

Classes are appreciated in PVE  There are always people for any pve content maps  Cons: Very toxic community or atleast in PVE People shoot you in insane mode(where theres friendly fire) and then leave to avoid being reported or people kick you just for kicks and laugh People rush to their deaths jeopardizing the mission telling people not to rush despite saying in a nice way will (1. get you kick. 2. being told to shutup and then kick) expecting you to revive them(if you are a medic) after diving in middle of enemy fire Rare to find people who speaks english Even more rare to find people who knows what to do most of the time.  Some PVP modes dont have people or at least takes forever to find a game. Contracts which is a quest that gives you reward after completing takes long to retake again.",

I looked it up and found out it was most popular on the PC, where it evolved. So I downloaded in on the PC as well. I gotta say, it saddened me to see that it didn't last on the Xbox 360. I really enjoyed it on there. But now it's time for my review.  This game is a nice change of pace. If your used to Call Of Duty or Battlefield. Thrown what you know out the door. I feel this game, with a COD feel. Has realistic gun play. Much more than COD. I love the fact that you can pair up to 4 people and complete missions as well. Instead of just head hunting each other all the time. The things I'm not a fan of in any game is micro-transactions. I understand that this is a free to play game and they need to make money. Agree 100%, but this game can honestly be a game that can be sold for X amount of dollars and I'm sure many people will purchase it. Like I said, not a fan of micro-transactions. Makes this feel like pay to win.  All in all this game is fun, it's a nice break for tryhards on COD and Battlefield. I suggest this free game to anyone out there who loves a good FPS. It's free, what do you have to lose? Exactly, nothing... give it a good try. I'm sure you will keep it around :)",

I've earned over 200 Warface dollars with 10 kills in one match, yet only earn like 64 in my most recent match, with 10 kills. It's really annoying; especially when you have to pay to repair your equipment, and getting new guns is a grind, if you want them permanently. It doesn't help that everybody has a ♥♥♥♥ing hard-on for sniper rifles when you get past level 9. You could should shoot someone's foot, and get a kill. The fact that they're even useful in close quarters, is such a travesty. Let's not even get started on the semi-automatic sniper rifles. Those are just all the butthurt in the world, formed into a gun. They're the king of overpowered weaponry.",

Four, the Engineer, he has a SMG and can plant mines and hack into stuff.

Let's just say it will turn out bad for   you.    The Versus matches are a lot of fun too. I like Plant the Bomb best cuz you also have to work as a Team to Defend the   Bomb sites and to Aattck them as well. I do not have to say much about Team Deathmatch cuz everyone know about it   but it is a LOT of fun if you all go as a team and just kill everyone in your way :) Capture is good too cause you have like   30 mins to win, in the end it's a killbox by the Capture points lol. The guns are good too and I like how you can give   your gun red lasers, grips and stuff like that.

If you're playing this game you need to think fast for a strategy, shoot the enemies fast, and run quick towards the objective to beat the enemy. Each class has their own role such as the Rifleman gives ammo to his/her teammates. The Sniper / Marksman his/her role is to eliminate futher threats to support teammates to move forward also they can also kill and scout enemies from a distance. If you're using the Sniper class you'd better be patient and suffiecient. The 3rd class is the Medic now this is the important class this is between your life or death because he/she gives you med packs also when you die the medic will revive with a defibrillator so you'd better be fast to help and heal your team or they'd die. Last class that'd be the Engineer he/she is capable of repairing you're vest/armor to absorb less damage but it takes a few seconds to repair itand the best part you can arm/plant a bomb did you know you can defuse it. Now really what I've expected from the Engineer class in warface was to build traps , turrets and explosives and to plant them anywhere able to plant them. now the coolest part was shooting while sliding to kill the hostile/enemy did ya know when u come across the hardest obstacle make sure you can help them climb up or help u climb up to move on.

Can't change servers 2. Over 70% of people that plays this game has bad ping and connection  so the worst problem here is that there is only 3 servers in the game North America, Europe and turkey(i guess) but no Asia? really are you kidding me? because i live south east asia that mean who ever lives in Asia that plays this game will lag and have bad ping and connection and another problem is theres no option to change server right im connected to North america but after that there's no going back and changing Thats even worst and that just really ruins it  so all i need now is only 2 things 1 is an Asia server 2 is an option to change servers  but overall it's still a good game good work and good luck Crytek :)",

The soldiers can only sprint for about 10 feet and it takes ages to switch weapons even though it is an arcade shooter (similar to COD). Even the game speed feels clunky I'm running it over 120fps but it sure doesn't feel like it. Using the 'special' equipment slot requires cycling through them with the same button as opposed to having a seperate button for each item which is weird. Those are the only real complaints I have and I have a lot of fun playing this game. The action is intense, the gunplay is solid, the matches are a perfect length, the community seems decent, and it's free. So check it out.",

By the fact I've already played it for 13 hours in under 2 weeks shows this game has both an addictive nature and a challenging nature that keeps you coming back to the missions. The intensity of the gameplay is far beyond the normal gameplay of games such as COD or Halo, the missions provide a range of difficulty, primarily vey hard, however. The game is a very standout FPS among many free to play FPS games which usually end up being below par. The abnormal difficulty is what I believe brings people to play this game for many hours on end, and the strong cooperative focus is something that is personally what I look for in a game, and even to the point of me wishing the devs would make updates for even crazier co-op. One thing I have wanted to see that hasn't been focused on is air combat. Despite many of the missions being focused on stopping a helicopter from smuggling various things, I haven't seen any combat take place in these helicopters, and I would absolutely love to see that become a part of this game. Other than that, Crytek is definitely a company I will be looking into for PC games.",

There is also the unlock system, which also plays a bit like Warframe where you unlock better gear by grinding. Warframe has a lot more grind though.   The PvE plays a lot like Counter Strike, atleast the Death-Match and Free-for-All parts. Just fast-paced, twitch based shooter with some tactics thrown in.  There is a cash shop, but I don't think it is P2W. Better gear almost always trumps skills, and a good level 1 player witch basic gear can wreck a level 10 player.   Cons -  -It's a F2P title, so expect a lot of grind and cash shop.",

I really can´t say there are too many, since I haven´t been in any match where it was blatantly obvious that someone was hacking, I have been in matches were the enemy team is trying to convince everyone to report a player for hacking, stating that a large majority of their kills are headshots, to be honest it´s not that hard to get headshots though. But many of the other players whom I have come across have told me of matches were aimbots/speedbots etc have been used.  * It takes forever to start a match! I´ve been able to go downstairs and make a pbj sandwich and still have time to get comfortable before the match starts * The game feels pretty unbalanced. 8 out of 10 matches are onesided as F**k The one thing that makes it interesting is that alot of the players are Latino (Mexican) and American (most trump supporters).... so that´s fun i guess :) No but really, if you have sensitive ears for racism stay away.  But the game is free to play, in no way is it pay to win. The sound is good and the graphics are impressive for a game like this.

Also making targets easier to hit) - Snipers aren't too terribly unbalanced (Not many spots in most of the maps that make camping over powered) - Different servers for different skill levels (You won't find any level 13+ players in you lobby as a level 1) - Leveling up doesn't take long upon starting the game  8/10 Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for an older style free to play low performance FPS.",

It has 4 classes which you can choose from and each their own weapons and play style. Rifleman uses assault rifles LMG's with the ability to resupply ammo to themselves and team. Medics can use shotguns and can heal and revive the team. Engineers use SMG's and they can place directional Mines while repairing armor for themselves and team. Lastly Snipers dont have any unique traits but the only thing is that they can deal high damage over long distances. The game is set-up for Cooperative gameplay right as soon as you login. You get to choose from 6 co-op missions that change everyday, 3 'Special Operations' which give really good payouts and a random item upon completion and lastly PvP mode which has 8 games to choose from. If you have friends it asks you before you join a game if you would want to invite them. The Devs update things every once in a while. The rotate new missions in and out and bring in newer Special Operative missions which are longer, much more difficult, and a drastically higher payout with unique rewards.   To unlock weapons/armor/attachments in the game, you have to earn VP which is won by completing missions and/or PvP matches. Once you unlock them, they are yours. In some instances you buy them with in-game currency, no biggie. Others are unlocked by level and you can buy them for 1 day, 7 days, or permanently. There are unique weapons and armor sets that require 'Crowns' for purchase. Crowns are earned by completing co-op missions. These are the 'elite' sets mostly recognized by their Orange color. They add stat and other bonuses to your character which gives a slight edge to your gameplay. Certain 'Special' weapons/armors are awared by completing the Spec Ops missions and they can have awesome advantages and perks.   Some of the main flaws with the game are that everyone is selfish and/or point ♥♥♥♥♥s, with the occasional hacker-central here or there. What I mean by selfish is that the majority of folks you play with dont adapt to the team. For example, everyone is either Assault or Sniper. There are barely ANY medics, besides myself. Another issue is poeple dashing or running super far ahead of everyone and getting themselves or the team killed. They would then blow up the message box telling you to 'rush to the next checkpoint' or 'just go' because they just want to be dumb and watch everyone die like they did. This normally occurs if you play the harder or Insane difficulty missions, and sadly even the easier ones. No one has a sense of Unit Cohoesion or cooperative play, hell let alone tactical prowess when you do missions or spec ops which makes you wonder why do you play as the supportive roles. They rush into danger and get themselves killed and ♥♥♥♥♥ at you to get shot at to revive them. Not alot of people play their class roles and there are only a small few people who have a tactical sense and work well with a team. It gets infuriating trying to heal or repair armor and the person youre helping just runs around like some CoD junky.  There are hackers here n there and its the main reason I stay away from the PvP elements. I dont call folks newbs or whatever because I know im not that great at PvP and my K/D spread is at a 0.9, I dont really care. But its when I get killed from a headshot by a dude across the map who is in a random corner shooting through walls. Or in a Domination game, they capture all posts instantly without moving an inch. Its things like that that become irritating to engage in PvP. There are very few that Ive noticed in the PvE portion, but I dont see anyone complaining. The matchmaking is unbalanced for new players. Youre thrust into any room or any game with people who outrank you with better gear. I understand the debate with skill vs gear and I did rock some people with just basic stuff but it gets kinda obvious that it takes quite a bit more hits to take down some people.   In my honest opinion... It gets a 6/10. I recommend it to people who want a quick taste of 'team FPS' other than dirty bomb... or TF2. I do like that the game is updated and changed frequently its great. The devs still have not made changes to playing a supportive role. You just get ♥♥♥♥ on by everyone for not being a rambo dumbass with no sense of tactical prowess.",

The rotate new missions in and out and bring in newer Special Operative missions which are longer, much more difficult, and a drastically higher payout with unique rewards.   To unlock weapons/armor/attachments in the game, you have to earn VP which is won by completing missions and/or PvP matches. Once you unlock them, they are yours. In some instances you buy them with in-game currency, no biggie. Others are unlocked by level and you can buy them for 1 day, 7 days, or permanently. There are unique weapons and armor sets that require 'Crowns' for purchase. Crowns are earned by completing co-op missions. These are the 'elite' sets mostly recognized by their Orange color. They add stat and other bonuses to your character which gives a slight edge to your gameplay. Certain 'Special' weapons/armors are awared by completing the Spec Ops missions and they can have awesome advantages and perks.   Some of the main flaws with the game are that everyone is selfish and/or point ♥♥♥♥♥s, with the occasional hacker-central here or there. What I mean by selfish is that the majority of folks you play with dont adapt to the team. For example, everyone is either Assault or Sniper. There are barely ANY medics, besides myself. Another issue is poeple dashing or running super far ahead of everyone and getting themselves or the team killed. They would then blow up the message box telling you to 'rush to the next checkpoint' or 'just go' because they just want to be dumb and watch everyone die like they did. This normally occurs if you play the harder or Insane difficulty missions, and sadly even the easier ones. No one has a sense of Unit Cohoesion or cooperative play, hell let alone tactical prowess when you do missions or spec ops which makes you wonder why do you play as the supportive roles. They rush into danger and get themselves killed and ♥♥♥♥♥ at you to get shot at to revive them. Not alot of people play their class roles and there are only a small few people who have a tactical sense and work well with a team. It gets infuriating trying to heal or repair armor and the person youre helping just runs around like some CoD junky.  There are hackers here n there and its the main reason I stay away from the PvP elements. I dont call folks newbs or whatever because I know im not that great at PvP and my K/D spread is at a 0.9, I dont really care. But its when I get killed from a headshot by a dude across the map who is in a random corner shooting through walls. Or in a Domination game, they capture all posts instantly without moving an inch. Its things like that that become irritating to engage in PvP. There are very few that Ive noticed in the PvE portion, but I dont see anyone complaining. The matchmaking is unbalanced for new players. Youre thrust into any room or any game with people who outrank you with better gear. I understand the debate with skill vs gear and I did rock some people with just basic stuff but it gets kinda obvious that it takes quite a bit more hits to take down some people.   In my honest opinion... It gets a 6/10. I recommend it to people who want a quick taste of 'team FPS' other than dirty bomb... or TF2. I do like that the game is updated and changed frequently its great. The devs still have not made changes to playing a supportive role. You just get ♥♥♥♥ on by everyone for not being a rambo dumbass with no sense of tactical prowess.",

So, let me give you a run down of what its like:  -&gt; Classes:  ~Rifleman: Just your average, run and gun player. Nothing special than just being able to replenish your ammo when you're either done spraying &amp; praying or when you eat the other team like its nothing with weapons that seem like they hold more bullet than you'd think.  ~Medic: Run around a corner against a Medic and you're guaranteed to lose. 9 out of 10 times, unless you headshot them first. Look out for automatic shotguns if you're against medics, and if you're a medic.. your best bet is automatic shotguns. They're extremely OP.  ~Engineer: Just like rifleman honestly. And its probably your best bet on PTB or any mode where you have to plant ♥♥♥♥, destroy ♥♥♥♥, basically anything needed to be done fast, Eng will end that ♥♥♥♥ like Mike Tyson fighting a infant.  ~Sniper: Good luck because this is where the most problems you'll see later in this review will come from. OP snipers and automatics are the biggest thing you'll find around Warface. So prepare to get ♥♥♥♥ed by Snipers.  -&gt; Gameplay  ~PVE/Survival Missions: The PVE missions under Co-op are basically the same ones over and over again so after 10 times, you get the jist of what to do, and where to go. And you can speed rush the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. But with survival.. there is videos by other content creators that spend hours playing their survival missions such as Marathon, HQ, Earth Shaker, etc. They put more work into their survival missions, than their co-op missions. And probably more than their PVP maps.   ~PVP: You're basically ♥♥♥♥ed in this. Lag is the worst thing you'll experience during PVP. There's 3 ♥♥♥♥in servers. And Not everyone plays on their own specific server. Turkey, EU, and North America. Because people dont play on their server, or because they dont have a server that works for them. They basically lag like crazy and you're ♥♥♥♥ed if you arent one of them. Yellow Bar players will never die, unless you're full of miracles. Red pingers will die, but its a toss up of how they will work. They'll die like normal, or they'll be just like Yellow Bars. Now.. White Bars. 2 Bars ♥♥♥♥ing suck like Yellow Bars. They tank shots like crazy. You'll have a 1 in 10 chance of killing a White 2 Bar. If Harambe had 2 White Bars, he'd be alive on Warface terms. 3 White Bars.. they are a give and take like Red Bars. They'll die.. or they wont. 4 Bars and 5 Bars.. are basically God in a nutshell. They will headshot the holy ♥♥♥♥ out of you before you get around the corner, or they'll eat your bullets like Its an open buffet at Golden Corral. If you see 4 Bars, you're just S.O.L.  -&gt; Final Conclusion:  ~ All in all.. i'd say Warface is a great game despite their many flaws. Ping is an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥, and if you dont have god ping, you're ♥♥♥♥ed unless you're either a hacker, or you have luck that the rest of us dont have. I'd play this over CoD probably 7 out of 10 times. While the community isnt that well on Warface, you dont have to listen to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ squeakers or people with mics up their ♥♥♥ and coming out their esophagus.",

            "review_text": "Warface is a bad game.  Like most F2P games, you'll need to make an account. No big deal, just a hassle. You also will have to put up with Warface using its own independent launcher, which means it updates outside of Steam. When Marvel Heroes has shown that F2P games can update from the Steam platform with few headaches, it's hard to give launchers a pass anymore.  Anyways, the game proper is very fond of its status as a co-op focused FPS. And Warface is, in fact, a co-op focused FPS. On the surface, it looks like you have a great new game for you and your buddies. Each day, a new rotation of missions is put in play, requiring you to complete the lower tiers of dificulty before the harder missions become available. So you'll do some mindless shooting, then get down to more objective based missions, and then get your ♥♥♥ handed to you in the highest tier content. Fun, right? No. Not fun. Don't you ever make that mistake again.  The thing about this content 'climb' is that there's no matching progression on the player side. You'll easily complete those first two missions each day, and then naively jump into the newly unlocked mission only to get absolutely slaughtered. You might make some progress, but eventually, there's a point where the game reminds you that you aren't using the 'cool stuff' yet, and will have you looking for the 'quit game' button.  On top of its hamfisted attempt at forcing players to spend money to have fun, the game doesn't always tell you the whole story. When you first start the game, you get a message saying that you can do a quick tutorial, and as a reward, they'll give you a free gun, a pair of gloves, and some in game currency. Having played the game in an earlier beta, I jumped on that offer.  Of course, after completing the training and looking at my inventory, I discovered that both the gun and gloves were set to expire in 24 hours. Nowhere did it tell me that beforehand, and they had never said it'd be a permanent reward, but it still comes across as gross and impersonal.  There are four classes in Warface, but for some reason, the devs have locked two of them away until you reach certain points in your ranking progression. This is great, because every match needed to be nothing but guys with sniper rifles and M16s. Who needs medics and engineers? This wasn't the case in the earlier build I played, and is a mindboggling change. Do they think players won't understand how the complicated mechanics of 'equip this, click to heal' work?  There is PVP as well, but it's an afterthought that you'd be better off ignoring. Honestly, I suggest you ignore this game entirely. Everything is designed in such a way that they hope you'll be tempted to open your wallet (Hey, you may be dead, but if you spend some money, you can revive yourself. Blatant disregard for our own games design is meaningless when it means making a quick buck!), unlocking new guns, attachments, and equipment is both luck and a grind. You have to select one of the three you'd like to work towards, and you can't choose which item in each you are working for. So if you don't want that sniper suit in the outfit section, well, it's going to stay the only thing you will get from outfit until you give up and unlock it over something in weapons or attachments. Great.  I had last played Warface during the closed beta, what feels like a year ago now. With the release on Steam, I was surprised to find that the game has actually actively become worse. The developers think you are an idiot, and will spend money at the slightest provocation. Don't prove them right.",

            "review_text": " My Background in other FPS games (context):  1,500 hours in CSGO. Thousands of hours in the Battlefield franchise. A few hundred hours in Call of Duty games.   Maps and Game Play:  The Warface maps are small--smaller even than Counter Strike, which is criticized for small maps. I'm not impressed with the Warface maps. They don't lend themselves to holding angles like CSGO. They aren't big like Battlefield. They aren't even tactically as good as COD. I struggle to understand the map design. They don't promote skill based play.  So if we're not holding angles and have precision based shooting like CSGO. And we're not dealing with a larger, tactical map like Battlefield. What are we doing in Warface?   You can do these unrealistic, arcade style slides? 9 times out of 10, I easily kill the arcade slider in close combat.   The other terrible game mechanic is toggling rapidly between laying prone and standing up. You can switch so fast that it looks like a   supernatural zombie.  In medium to close combat, expect the prone toggler but its not that hard to spray them down.  I enjoyed playing the game, but the maps and gameplay options just get old. The prone toggling and arcade sliding, while fun at first, don't lend themselves to long term game play.   Pay to Play or Win:  You can pay for better weapons. Some claim you can get these weapons for free by grinding XP. Yes, you can.   But you can't afford to use them afterwards! Try using some of the best weapons, armor, boots, etc in the game. You will pay HUGE repair costs after each mission. You will pay more for the repair costs than you made on the mission. Forget pay to win. It's pay to play.  Think about it. It's a free game. Repair costs are there to force you to pay to use the weapon. The whole game mechanic is designed to force you to spend money (or the game can't exist). Or not be able to use the weapons you either purchased or unlocked through grinding levels and XP.   Hacks : If you have played other FPS games, you know there will always be hacks. Rather than a real anti-cheat that detects when the game's memory has been compromised, they opted for Fair Fight. Fair Fight is a performance based anti-cheat, where if you play substantially better suddenly you can be banned. There's other factors as well.  The problem is hack sites that sell wallhacks and aimbots also provide guides for getting around Fair Fight. A lot of it is common sense about doing better slowly, not following people through walls, not following people who can't see you, etc.  I've seen more wallhacks in Warface than I saw in CSGO, Battlefield, and COD combined. It's infested. There's even people in game advertising hack sites. It's easy (but not always reliable) to scream aimbot in any game. The truth is, any aimbot shot COULD have been made by a skilled player. It's easier for me to spot a wallhacker and in Warface, there's always going people who ALWAYS know where everyone is.  I have seen dozens of people Fair Fight banned. I just think with the guides out there for getting around Fair Fight, many are getting around it.  Develop a real anti-cheat that detects when the game has been hooked.   Summary:  If you want a Battlefield type of game, with super small maps, less tactical options, and prone togglers, then play this game.   If you get beat in other FPS games, just spend money on this game. You can buy super fast boots that make you run much faster. You can buy health regenerating vests that will take you from near death to 100%. You dream it--you can buy it. And maybe even win, assuming you find a game without a wall hacker. ;)",

The Multiplayer is fun the first levels but after that it gets so much more annoying, you fidn more hackers and for some reason people get way too salty.   If there's something I really liked about this game is the way you unlock stuff. As every onther F2P you have the option to pay real money to buy stuff in-game and the way Warface implemented its system (IMO) is one of the best I've seen. I like the fact that if you play enough you can pretty much unlock anything you want, and that the thigs you're able to pay for are mostly asthetics or dont give you a big advantage.   Overall, really cool game with a lot of potential, but if the devs want the game to be big, they should start caring about it a bit more, improve ther support team and get rid of all the hackers, if that ever were to happen, I'd give the game a nice 8/10.",

Maybe it's because I'm the one that always gets smacked and killed by a shield. Maybe it's that teammates half the time don't care that I get hit by the shield, and just watch as I die. Co-op sucks, unless you have good friends to play it with.   Not to mention the shop system isn't that good either. Wait, so you buy a gun permanently, but you have to REPAIR it for use? Why not just rent it, then, since you're going to be spending money to use it anyway! (I hate rental systems, but the repair system seems just as bad to me.)  If you didn't read my little rant, the game is little more than an irritation to me. I wouldn't seriously recommend the game.  5/10, not bad ideas, but not very enjoyable.  Edit: Even if the game has been changed in updates, I don't plan to return to it. Like I said, I don't care about the pvp, and the issue with co-op was usually the community.

However the cons cancel out the pros and then some in my opinion.  Pros:  Lots of maps  Most maps are well designed  Classes are balanced  Runs great (was staying above 100fps maxed out on my mid-range rig)   Quite a lot of modes  A few colorful maps that come as a surprise (the Brazil map is beautiful)   The hub is well done and clean (I really like how you add on attachments)   Slide function is really fun and fluid  Some team work aspects are cool, like helping one another to reach places.  Free  Not a big download   Cons:  Some maps are copied and pasted  it will cost you OVER $400 to purchase all the permanent gear and weapons   Visuals are sub-par for a Crytek game  Hit detection is pretty awful  Several modes are just poorly executed compared to other games  Options menu is lacking FoV and other things  No way to search for servers via Ping  Tutorial is awful, and leaves a lot unexplained. (it gets explained later when you unlock more classes, but stuff like weapon melee, sliding, and other basic mechanics should be explained in the FIRST tutorial not later)   Suffers from the same thing that BF4 does where some icons like revive and where the bomb is are just WAY too big.   Pay2win in the sense that you can buy objectively superior gear, however you do have to work to unlock it so it's pretty  balanced at first.  NEWB CHANNELS ARE NOT RANK CAPPED!!!! This results in experienced players coming in and making the game extremely unfun for new players.    Overall the game's cons out weigh the pros so I have to unrecommend, however it is worth a shot right now since as mentioned it's not a big download and as of now since everyone is new it's pretty balanced, however I don't see this game having a long life span unless they fix the hit detection and server searching. It is still in beta so I can hope for sever improvements (it happened in BF4 8 MONTHS after release, so there's definitely hope!)",

It's fast paced and there's variety amongst classes and some great ideas, like co op climbing up high walls like you see in military vids. You give your team mate a bunk up then he helps you up, it's a great touch as is the baseball type slide feature. It's also got some ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ideas like having to pay to fix your rifle and gear which takes half your money that you earn each round, which is also pitiful. More annoyingly, you can't search for a server close to you, it just gives you a slot so connections are widely variable which means lag is a massive issue. I've had my end give me a kill then his end catches up and say that no, I actually died. You can't play like that. Your shots just go through people because they have already ♥♥♥♥ing moved and the connection hasn't caught up.  Also one plays to the classes. Medics don't revive (although the defib in this game is the worst designed feature I've seen) and riflemen never resupply. Every round I've played people are in it for themselves, they don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about you or the team. There are hackers everywhere and no one cares. I will never understand that mentality. I'll probably put a few more hours into it, because I haven't found a good FPS yet that I can just play a quick round or two whenever I want but I know I'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with the community here very quickly.

(probably with 'Kredits' though, which obviously are bought with real world currency and aren't in anyway stolen from Mortal Kombat)  -Parkour is nice  -Graphics are very nice  -Enemy AI is...decent. Although the animation of an enemy falling over after it dies looks exactly like what you'd see in Golden Eye. ---------------------------------------- The main problem with this game is that it's very... unoriginal, generic, etc. It's exactly what 'Generic FPS Game' the game would look like.

However, the game is pretty fancy for a f2p and the gameplay needs only little improvements to make it more nervous and fun. Currently, it's more a cheap coop 'beat'em all' than a military missions based game, where tactic would be an option.  Hope it will improve soon, because this game deserves it.",

Customization is okay. Coop is okay. Cons: Versus matchmaking is unbalanced. Shooting gets boring and even with strong fps and mbs the bullets just don't seem to kill anyone who has high level armor (p2w issue). Throwing grenades function is bad but the grenades are surprisingly lethal and realistic (blows up even after death if pin is pulled). Character speed is about 1.5x faster than reality (so about .5x faster than cod). Medic is the most powerful and interesting aspect to this game. As there are no finishing 'downed' enemies. So anyone who has been downed can be revived by a medic (within 20 seconds of falling) an unlimited # of times. So yeah hands down medic is the coolest part about this shooter. Loading times are a little slow because you have to wait for everyone to load the map (like DOTA2 not CSGO), however the matches start extremely quickly (2.5 seconds after spawn) so you don't have to wait an eternity wondering if player 5 is going to spawn. Overall I'd give Warface a thumbs up but rate it 6/10. If you want MORE pay to win action and customization go play Tom Clancy. If you'd rather have reliable weapons and positive matchmaking. I'd suggest Counter Strike: Global Offensive as an alternative to this game. However, If you want none of those things and just prefer some light FPS matchmaking, difficult coop missions, or some moderate customization &amp; P2W, I'd recommend this game.",

The game isn't F2P in any sense: everything can be baught with in-game currency for fairly cheap and timed drops are plentiful. However, the map design really ruins it all.  A breakdown first:  * Decent graphics (definitely dated though). Sound definitely needs work, in my opinion. Not quite sure what it is, but the entire game seems to have a 'plastic toy' feel to it, you know? Dinky guns, dinky finishes.  * Team-based gameplay. You need medics to heal and revive soldiers. You need engineers to resupply armor plating. Snipers do the dirty deeds from afar and the assault provides the ammo. You'll need at least the medic and assault to survive. Snipers are almost necessary for some targets, but engineers are fairly useless. You can help each other climb up ledges too which is a... thing... I guess? Personally never saw anyone actually do it.  * Nice community - I'm sure most of them have learned to deal with the negatives, but I never heard much complaining. Ever time I joined a co-op game they're try to add me as a friend.  * F2P model is just right. The premium currency can be earned in-game by leveling up and completely some fairly nasty wagers (in goes in-game. If you win, out comes premium). The only items that are really blocked off to that premium currency are a few aesthetics and a couple decent weapons (they're in no way overpowered though). In-game currency can be used to buy items, and you can rent them cheaper to try them out.   * Might I add the shop's method of comparing different weapons is so easy. I dig it. However, armors not so much. They barely say what they do, don't use a consistent format, and honestly I only have a vague idea which of 'better protection' or 'good protection' is more significant.  * Co-op missions are fairly fun and change daily. The varied difficulty is nice and the insane missions actually being insane really helps. Revive coins definitely show the F2P side, though.  * Controls work just fine.  But the damn maps.  One game of Storm, the enemy was attacking us. We were pushing pretty hard so pushed forward literally 2 corners. About 30 feet from the cap point (which was only about 10 from our spawn) and... their spawn was a tiny room. The rest of the game was just spawn killing the same two guys (as the rest of the team left as soon as the balance of power showed) over and over again. It was literally impossible for them to ever recover.  Fine, maybe it's just that map. I jump into a game of breach (1 spawn, 1 sided capture the flag). The first round we lost fair and square. But in the second round we take it slower, check our corners and within 40 seconds we all die... from behind. Third round... within 15 seconds an enemy had rounded the corner and killed us all. Just to make sure I wasn't insane, I ran out as fast as I could on the fourth and, sure enough, they spawned about 30 feet from us - with a clear home-field advantage. I couldn't imagine a way we could come out of it.  Like I said, the game itself is fun and the F2P aspect is just right. But those maps, my friends, they make the download not worth it.",

            "review_text": "I write this from the perspective of someone who has come to desire FPS games to grant mobility, reward heroism, emphasize cooperation and unity, yet still allow independence.  I won't go out and blatantly say Warface violates all of these, but it leaves much to be desired compared to bigger hit titles (which sure, cost more but comparing a bought game to a F2P isn't the best idea to begin with). Warface is a game that tries hard to emphasize teamwork...so hard that incompetence will easily ruin the game faster than a lag-related glitch any day. Ammunition is often limited, enemies somewhat difficult to kill when engaged in the wrong circumstances, heroics frequently resulting in death, new players and slow learners easily discouraged by deadly mistakes, and solo play virtually impossible. Progression leading to new, more desirable weapons is excruciatingly slow and as of the moment, buying too much permanent equipment often results in repair costs that actually end up more taxing than mission payout rewards, forcing you to tackle higher difficulty sessions (and risk mission failure to wrack up repair costs even further).  There is a rather interesting class system set in play; you enter roles that have the added ability to replenish ammunition, recover health and revive friendlies, restore body armor, and engage enemies from long range. Unfortunately, the roles have a fairly severe lack of balance and reason (Snipers have no inherent special ability, medics are restricted to shotguns, which forces them to the frontline and face direct fire) and players are rewarded very little for fulfilling their roles when compared to enemy kills in general. I personally don't mind finding myself on the bottom of the score leaderboards when I know I singlehandedly kept the team alive as a medic, but it's discouraging enough to other players to the point that they'd rather pick up a rifle and commit to the spray&amp;pray approach instead.  Also, jumping is pretty much worthless. Expect yourself rooted to the ground.  To wrap it up, Warface is a Crytek F2P approach to Team Co-Op/PvP modern warfare. To get far in this game, you have to pay either alot of cash or alot of devotion (of which I no longer am motivated to spend either). If you're a fan of Co-Op repetitive shooters where the odds are often stacked against you, this will be worth considering. If you have a hero complex, hate shooters, or have come to expect shooting games to be more fast-paced (Titanfall, CoD, BF, TF2), you may wish to consider putting this back on the shelf and moving on.",

Counterstrike, Battlefield, and Call of Duty make a lot of money. Lets take all the worst aspects of these games and put them into our own, with delicious micro-transaction frosting on top!

            "review_text": "The actual gameplay is decently fun and has a pretty nice reliance on teamwork. The game isn't F2P in any sense: everything can be baught with in-game currency for fairly cheap and timed drops are plentiful. However, the map design really ruins it all.  A breakdown first:  * Decent graphics (definitely dated though). Sound definitely needs work, in my opinion. Not quite sure what it is, but the entire game seems to have a 'plastic toy' feel to it, you know? Dinky guns, dinky finishes.  * Team-based gameplay. You need medics to heal and revive soldiers. You need engineers to resupply armor plating. Snipers do the dirty deeds from afar and the assault provides the ammo. You'll need at least the medic and assault to survive. Snipers are almost necessary for some targets, but engineers are fairly useless. You can help each other climb up ledges too which is a... thing... I guess? Personally never saw anyone actually do it.  * Nice community - I'm sure most of them have learned to deal with the negatives, but I never heard much complaining. Ever time I joined a co-op game they're try to add me as a friend.  * F2P model is just right. The premium currency can be earned in-game by leveling up and completely some fairly nasty wagers (in goes in-game. If you win, out comes premium). The only items that are really blocked off to that premium currency are a few aesthetics and a couple decent weapons (they're in no way overpowered though). In-game currency can be used to buy items, and you can rent them cheaper to try them out.   * Might I add the shop's method of comparing different weapons is so easy. I dig it. However, armors not so much. They barely say what they do, don't use a consistent format, and honestly I only have a vague idea which of 'better protection' or 'good protection' is more significant.  * Co-op missions are fairly fun and change daily. The varied difficulty is nice and the insane missions actually being insane really helps. Revive coins definitely show the F2P side, though.  * Controls work just fine.  But the damn maps.  One game of Storm, the enemy was attacking us. We were pushing pretty hard so pushed forward literally 2 corners. About 30 feet from the cap point (which was only about 10 from our spawn) and... their spawn was a tiny room. The rest of the game was just spawn killing the same two guys (as the rest of the team left as soon as the balance of power showed) over and over again. It was literally impossible for them to ever recover.  Fine, maybe it's just that map. I jump into a game of breach (1 spawn, 1 sided capture the flag). The first round we lost fair and square. But in the second round we take it slower, check our corners and within 40 seconds we all die... from behind. Third round... within 15 seconds an enemy had rounded the corner and killed us all. Just to make sure I wasn't insane, I ran out as fast as I could on the fourth and, sure enough, they spawned about 30 feet from us - with a clear home-field advantage. I couldn't imagine a way we could come out of it.  Like I said, the game itself is fun and the F2P aspect is just right. But those maps, my friends, they make the download not worth it.",

When I first started playing I asked 'why isn't this game HUGE?' well now I know why, I've played a total of 22 hours on my new account and I currently just uninstalled the game. I'm against having any sort of gear system in the first place, I just don't see how you can balance that other then giving everyone the gear for free and allowing them to change at any time. The only reason I would called this game 'pay to win' is because of the gear system. After I hit LVL 13 crytek (the devs) gives you a bunch of guns and the Warlord armor (the best armor) for 7 days. I have done very well in this game since getting the armor and guns and was able to maintain my 2.5 KD(I mainly play shooters). I currently lost my 7 day armor and guns and now I can tell a huge difference! I die 10x faster than before. You also notice when someone is using the Warlord Armor because they take 10x more bullets than someone without it. The gear can be bought by just playing the game but to by the Warlord set for EVERY class it would take LOADS of grinding or of course you could throw some real cash at it and get the gear instantly. Some people won't mind this system, but play vs someone who has Warload Armor and you will notice how annoying it is, you could seriously shoot first, shoot more with both of you having the same gun and they still tank it and kill you. This won't be a problem for some but you are either grinding your ♥♥♥ off to compete or throwing some real life cash at the game. Also the really good guns are behind crates you can buy with cash you earn but the odds of getting them are really slim. They have the auction house were people can buy the guns with cash instead of going through the crates. This game in my eyes is P2W, such a good game doing the shop and gear all wrong.  Besides those few issues the game is REALLY fun, very solid free to play shooter. If the shop and gear system wasn't so annoying this game would be easily one of the best free to play shooters on the market.  6/10",

The servers are hosted by the players, and half the time you get an unresponsive host who won't even start the game.

It moved me from 'Beginner's Channel' to 'Professional Players Channel'. I have 10 hours in the game, and it's considering me a professional? 'Whatever, I'll try this. It's just a title for non-beginners I guess.' Is my first thought. I join a match and in the loading screen everyone's name is decorated with cool banners and icons, 'No biggy, they've just been playing awhile.'   Not even 2 minutes into the game we're spawn-locked in our beginning building, actually having to run for cover the minute we spawn because of snipers head-glitching in positions where their forehead it seemed was some Medusa-spawn death machine firing bullets. Don't get me wrong, in the first 7 ranks or so there were times we got spawn camped just due to general lack of skill on my team, but the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is when I actually started successfully getting out of the base to try on some offense. On 8 or 9 different occasions I hit a full-frontal headshot with my shotgun and their fancy pay-to-win armor blocked all the damage. I actually hit one guy straight in his skullcap, and again in his body from up close and didn't do half his health in damage, whilst him and his fancy pistol, yes pistol, were one-shotting me even with the brand new armor the game gave me for leveling up. This game is so pay-to-win it's hilarious.  I tried out the sniper, got a few well-aimed headshots that hit hard, but again, not even half their health. (the game indicates the damage you've done on your screen via a large transparent hitmarker).. This game had so much potential, I was absolutely hooked until this point. Totally lost in it. I had so much fun but in one single game it became unplayable.   ____________________________________________________________ TL;DR:  ***********This game is fun until rank 8 where the 'pay-to-win' players are unleashed upon you full-force.

I mean, I recommend the game to anyone who wants a couple entertaining hours. This is a one-night stand with a lifeless doll, nothing more.  First off, I pay to win ('pay to support the devs'). Always. This is the FIRST free-to-play game I've played in which I've put down NO money whatsoever.  There's a way to do pay-to-win so that it's fun, and pay-to-win works better in a co-op-based game. In order for pay-to-win to work, however, the game needs to have a fun progression system. You can pay to BYPASS it, but it's there all the same. It's sort of like the unspoken ethic of free-to-play: reward those who pay, but don't punish those who don't. The system is only tolerable if the non-paying route is fun as well. Unfortunately, progression in Warface has been tragically undercut.  Warface has cynically scrapped a feeling of progression by limiting you to a few managable missions at a time. You'll play the 2 or 3 brief missions you can manage, then come up against missions which are too difficult for your level of loot. You're quickly left with a choice: keep replaying the same couple of missions to grind out money and unlocks (which come SO slowly) or pay to play that 4th mission. Their goal is that in any one play session, you'll get bored of easy missions and hungrily eye that 3rd or 4th mission. Seriously: they seem to think the key to getting your money is by making you bored.   I played it two nights in a row, and both times I reached a point where I had memorized enemy spawns on easy and regular missions. Seriously.   Perhaps the most disgusting thing about Warface is the temporary loot. You'll earn loot which disappears after 24 hours, whose only purpose -- I can assume -- is to create a feeling of loss. 'Nooo! Now I have crappier gloves, and I'll have to pay in order to be as good as I was.' It's as if the developers know the game doesn't inspire people in the least, so they've turned to manipulating base emotions in order to get a buck.   I always support free to play games I dabble in, but not this one. It's too cynical, too needy, and not nearly enough fun. The game's life and character begins and ends with its name.",

So unfortunate because the game has such a solid foundation: Simple mechanics, clean graphics and straight forward maps. A no frills, simple but entertaining game play. In theory...

I played quite a bit and even once I earned money to afford the weapons there was always an error so, I was never able to buy a thing. Seems like a scam if you ask me but, just a 'glitch'.   There is no weapon upgrading system, realistic or functioning that is. Maybe you want to pay to play and the shop isn't glitchy, you still have to deal with inconsitent mechanincs/physics. The hit marker seems lagging, like many shots that you can get off or obviously connect on just don't register and that kills a lot of it for me too. The sniper is most realistic, in a reasonable range but even the sniper doesnt register a decent amount of shots at a distance.   My last straw was when all the good gear they start you with breaks or needs to be renewed and you cant even regenerate health anymore. You make like 300 bucks a game and just a vest is like 12k. So you REALLY have to grind and I did. I went to buy the vest and had about 11k more than I needed and for two days it would not let me buy the vest and couple that with 1990s gameplay reliablitly and it is now deleted.

Ok so, this game plays like a mod of the 'non suit' human players in the MP versions of all crytek's FPS games. Movement is slow, and the sliding is clumsy- especially when you are looking around while sliding and shooting. Hit registration is poor and sometimes greatly delayed and variable. The levelling up and earning money to buy upgrades is HORRIBLY slow and poor- as bad as some of the worst of the FTP games.  This is particularly distressing as the maps available are not only limited, but poorly designed. The maps have a very unrefined unpolished and amateurish quality to it. This applies especially to the strange notion that some of the maps are consistently all about spawn camping and fighting this as an offensive and defensive custer's last stand.  Except for coop, there is not a lot of room to maximally use the class tools for everyone, since even from months ago, most playing do not see any need or reason to take classes other than assault and sniper. There is a horrrendously poor disadvantage as a medic with the shotgun when facing a team full of equally skilled players using assault or sniper in a one life to live match.  If this game is to take off I have the following things to say: - increase run speed, remove sprint and replace it with a walk function, remove slide or improve its mechanic, add a run to dive to prone, add a lean function. - allow medics and engies to be able to boost health and armor OVER the max by a percentage that varies between classes( sniper&lt;engie&lt;assault&lt;medic). - make larger maps, with real design aspects that allow for need and utilization of the classes. If there are cqc situations, why the hell do we need a combat medic who should be healing the team running around charging the enemy? - Also, make better objectives, be original. Stop making the next new COD. - make it worth spending time trying to level up and allow a pickup dropped gun, regardless of class- just make an acc. penalty for it or such (so a medic cant become an instant super sniper). - reduce stupid spamming paid for items that destroy fun in public matches (ftp model fail). - Id happily donate 50 bucks flat out for a full MP only game if it was solid and not interested in fleecing players.  The plus is that it looks and moves very nicely, although slow. Coop is pretty fun but very standard and much of the maps are simple corridor maps. After a few playthroughs, the gimmick is gone.  Conclusion: poor replay value, player base will drop off sharply within the week.  **btw forgot to add, says 2.2 hrs in steam, I played it a bunch directly before the Steam release.",

Im used to it, but the in game premium currency is that of a mobile game. Looks like alot of dough in game, when really you get to only buy the gun for 30 days at a time. 560 K ( The credits in-game) Times 12 is 6720. Youl get that amount of credits with a little over 10 bucks. Doesnt seem like alot, but when you have 4 different classes, each with different weapons and skins and all that, witch WILL be needed to be payed for every month. So take that 6720 and multiply it by 5, then reduce about 400 Kredits becuase not all the weapons are the same price. Got that number now?

Just run in, get killed and call you out if you don't rush to them and rez them asap (Even if it means to get killed, too). Or you get downed and signal your medic to rez you and he just runs headlong into the thickest throng of enemies and gets instantly mauled. Ah, good times...  Repetitive and boring gameplay: Well, you have four classes, Rifleman, Sniper, Medic and Engineer. Three of those four classes have an actual role in this game, the sniper is just.. I don't know, useless. Why? Because all maps are narrow, small and absolutely not suited for long-range-sniping. Plus all classes have a skill, needed if playing team-based. Except the sniper. Medics can rez, Riflemen can give you ammo and Engineers restore your armor. Snipers just.. No, the don't have any of this.. The 'missions' are all the same: get to the evac-point, slaughter as many bad guys as you can and extract. So, yeah, it's like CoD with bad graphics and no story at all (well, not that CoD's storys are THAT awesome...)  Pure grind: I remember when Cryteks CEO said, that after Warface no AAA-Game could survive without beeing F2P. Well, more P2W. The game is free, don't get me wrong, but the best equipment can only be bought with premium-coins, which, as usual, cost real money. You can get most of the stuff by playing missions, but the progress is so slow, you could well be in your 80'ies before you even get to the good stuff. So, did Crytek stay true to their CEO's words? Nope, not even close..   Would I recommend this game? If you have a godlike-tolerance for curse-words, grinding the grind till it grinds and have absolutely no interest in any kind of story aside from some words at the start of your mission, then yes, by all means, play this game!  If those points don't appeal to your liking, then don't. Play Solitair or Minesweeper..",

            "review_text": "Overall, this game is mediocre at best. Co-op can be fun if you get a decent team. Versus is fun until you hit level 10.  First, the Co-op. The long load times before a game can take up to a minute. Since there are appearently few servers, expect to be playing with gamers from South America. Lag has been a huge issue as far as I've seen. Most players from my random glancing are lucky to get 3 or so bars. The overall map designs on Co-op are fun and on anything other than 'Hardcore' difficulty, it's typically a race among players to get to the finish. You will occassionally run into team-work oriented players who will play as the role suggests, but more often than not you will be relying on the scattered checkpoints to refill health and armor as well as ammunition. 'Hardcore' difficulty only ramps up enemy health and gives them an absurd boost to damage. An enemy NPC who would otherwise be a speedbump can now engage at rifle distance with a shotgun and mow down half your team.  For versus, the game feels inspired by Call of duty and Battlefield, and does neither well. Lag is even more of a problem here, and it is common to get shot through walls or containers. The game pits you with rank 1-10 initially, and paying for boxes will net you a nice advantage weapon wise. I don't suggest trying to get any of the permanent items from the boxes, since I have yet to see anyone with one in game, and you will be wasting your money for 'rentals.' After you hit rank 10, you forced to go to 'Experienced Players' or 'Professional Players' channels. Not that there is much of a choice, because I have yet to see any more than 1 channel at 50% capacity outside of 'Rookie Players' where a good 90% of players are. This means you get about a dozen games to pick from after rank 10. Since the rank is from 1-70, you will often be out-gunned, and can expect to find yourself in a constant ♥♥♥ whooping due to poor auto-balance implementation.  In the 30 or so hours i've played, I've encountered 4 people blatently hacking/using exploits. The weapon, equipment, and unlocking schemes are randomly based on catagory, so expect to dump some time into one of them before you win the lottery and get to unlock the item you're after.  Overall the game feel like it took a bunch of user feedback from what players want in a modern first person shooter, and hap-hazardly threw them together. The game fails to convey all the controls during the tutorials (Press 'X' to go prone, for example.) and the slide function, while pretty cool, breaks the feel of combat. Not to mention to even stand a chance in a one on one fire-fight, you have to go prone, and get back up (all while still firing by the way) which is kind of rediculous since if you get knocked down you have to wait for a team-mate to help you up (or wait for your stamina bar to painstakingly slowly recharge).  My suggestion is to avoid this game until they fix lag and hacking issues, then give it a chance to see if it is up your alley when there is a larger community.",

However, now this is a full release title i must say that the transition has yielded little improvement over the beta versions problems. There are still problems with server lag, the UI is still too clunky and non intuitive. There is still a distinct lack of weaponry and the weapons themselves just don't feel right.   Also this title makes a distinct claim over how it uses the Cryengine an incredibly powerful egine known for having incredible graphical fidelity and uses this as a selling feature. (look at the Crysis series, Mech Warrior Online, Archeage (currently in alpha) at a few examples of how beautiful games can be) However in Warface the implimenation of the engine has produced dissapointing results with low res textures in areas and lack luster effects, not what i would have hoped for in a game using the Cryengine.  Then we come to the worst part of all, the pay to win nature of the game. Every upgrade that can be bought from the in game micro transactions store gives a player a heavy advantage over someone who is playing free, and this is just not acceptable in todays market. Granted i respect that games need to make a profit but there are other examples of micro transactions models that don't disadvantage the free player over the player paying a little extra, see Planetside 2 as a prime example of this.  In conclusion warface show's promise, it could be great, it could definatly be a viable alternative to games such as CSGO and other competitive FPS shooters, but not in its current state. Right now i would avoid this title, grab a copy of CSGO and wait to see if the glaring issues are ironed out during the next few months.  Thanks for reading.",

I played the game on high and it really did not look impressive, I know graphics is not what a game should be rated on a a whole, but with all these crytek boasts put everywhere I would expect better. Even on high graphics it reminds me on battlefield bad company 2 , which had better graphics was realsed along time ago, and plays much smoother with bigger maps. What I am trying to say is that the game is poorely optimized for the graphics it gives. The game doesn't play smooth even on low graphics on a decent PC ( GTX 650 TI OC 2GB ) .   The gameplay is not very impressive at all since its not unique as a mentioned above, and it is pay to win. The kids with big wallet parents will always come out on top in gunfights with there expensive high acuaracy, high damage guns. If you have a large enough wallet the game will basically play itself. The spawns are awful, You will get spawned killed alot, and its very often that a oppenet will be behind you due to the spawn points being so bizzare.   I would change my opion of this game and possibly even like it, if they fix the spawns and no longer sell over powered weapons or anything that gives a player a unfair advantage, In CS:GO its just gun camo's which are avaiable for purchase, which is fair due to the fact no body gets a unfair advantage, and people can still boast about their guns.",

The classes are cool, the slide mechanic adds another dimension to close range firefights, and the TDM maps are pretty fun and balanced for the most part.    However... this game has NO anti-cheat, and the hacking community makes full use of it. In my and my friends who played experiences, every 4th or 5th game would have a player aimbotting, or cross-map wallbanging (literally, you spawn, and die in the spawn area bc you're getting headshot by a guy in the OTHER spawn zone through all of the map's buildings). Also, the game is incredibly buggy, after 1 in every 3 matches or so, your game will crash and freeze your comp so you have to hard shutdown. I had enough of the pervasive bugs when i tried to adjust my mouse sensitivity and my comp froze.   Basically, this game had potential to be a whole lot of casual and/or competitive fun, but in its current state, i strongly advise to stay away, unless you can deal with multiple computer crashes a sitting and frequent and obvious hackers. If they fix these two areas, i will definitely give Warface another chance bc its some of the most fun i've had on a shooter recently, and it's a nice casual break from CS.",

It also means that you get things one at a time, and the process can be kinda slow sometimes. However, the streamlined nature of this means that you will always have a clear goal in mind, and you don't get confused about what to do next.

None of it is inspired (which is something that can be said about the game as a whole). Also, many of the maps are way too small for the number of players they allow, and so the matches can get pretty messy. -While the graphics are good, the aesthetics are bland. It will not wow you with it's looks. Also, the same re-used themes for maps show up again and again- suburban neighborhood with buses blocking the road, cargo docks, and war-torn middle eastern cities. Again- uninspired. -The game claims that it's largely focused on teamplay, and that really isn't true. Certain classes have different abilities that can help your teammates, but people rarely use them. Sure, there are places that can only be accessed if you bring a partner, but those are really only used at the beginning of rounds when everbody moves out at once. Otherwise, it's simply a limit on the places you can easily traverse. -You could easily make an argument that shotguns are overpowered.  Overall: Despite all of the problems with it, I did had fun with this game- for a little while. It gets boring quick, and there are far better games out there. If you need something free to scratch your CoD Clone itch, then this is it- but it isn't really anything more than that.  Final score: 4.5/10. Would only reccomend to a few people.",

Co Op is a LITTLE better. It's just another uninspired generic military shooter.   In short, this game is better than COD Ghosts, but only because it's free.

Now don't get shot :)  The multiplayer aspect of the game could be good if it wasn't riddled in grenades and other things that go boom. I didn't notice anything that seemed pay-to-win. The defaults weapons are actually really good. I spent most of the time as a sniper which was definitely viable. I managed to unlock the first bolt action after a few Coop missions and took it into PvP. I was 1 shotting people at close ranges and it wasn't very hard to hit people in the head. The hitbox is pretty massive.  Overall, the game just felt meh. Not too many pay-to-win elements but the game was definitely ruined by grenade spaming.

Overall: Despite all of the problems with it, I did had fun with this game- for a little while. It gets boring quick, and there are far better games out there. If you need something free to scratch your CoD Clone itch, then this is it- but it isn't really anything more than that.  Final score: 4.5/10. Would only reccomend to a few people.",

            "review_text": "-First note, this is not Pay 2 Win- This game is pretty garbarge, unless you like co-op. What do I like about this game? The co-op. Thats it. And its pretty similar to survival from CoD. And in my opinion this game is basically CoD: Ghosts, only with worse graphics and debatably worse maps.  Now lets talk about the maps. They are smaller versions of cod ghosts maps. So basically its like combining the chaos of Nuketown and adding the camping of CoD Ghosts. Everyone camps. Thats how people get high scores basically. Also there is another mechanic that is in this game. Sliding. Now sliding is incredibly op, and you can take down any player with sliding and maybe proning.  Now lets talk about the guns. For one, the hit detection is AWFUL. Sometimes it will take 2 seconds for bullets to register. The guns also do very low damage (except for snipers and a couple rifles rifle). This can be very very annoying if you are running engineer with the starter SMG, (by the way, there are 4 classes. Sniper, Medic, Engineer, and Rifleman, which I will get to later) then its really annoying because it has lots of recoil, (more than in almost any game i've played) and takes around 10 bullets to kill with a 30 bullet magazine. Not to mention the guns aren't very accurate. So basically with the starter SMG you can only get about 1 maybe 2 kills with it.  The Sniping. Its pretty bad, considering that it wavers really weirdly and its uncontrollable. It just takes to long to hit someone.  Explosives: the grenades have range even more than CoD4, and they're pretty dang OP. The claymores are more overpowered than in cod, so take it or leave it as you wish Now lets talk about classes. Like I mentioned before there are 4 classes. The sniper is pretty straightforward. A 1-2 shot knife (there is a right and left click attack for the knife), a grenade, and of course, a sniper. Every class has a grenade, and the Rifleman is I believe to be the only class without knife. The Engineer has an SMG, a claymore, and grenade. The starting smg is pretty horrible (like I mentioned before) with the bad hitreg, high recoil, and low damage, and he also can restore armor. Later SMG's are really OP and do high dmg with better mags. The Rifleman is a pretty straightforward class. He comes with an LMG, a grenade, and a pistol (every class comes with a pistol). The medic can heal people (including yourself) and revive people. The medic comes with a shotgun, and is incredibly OP with sliding.  The Health system. Its the same as Counter-Strike, with armor and non-regening health. Nothing more to be said. Ranking system- pretty crap, considering that after Lvl 13 you get matched with Lvl 80s, who slide and camp their asses off. I simply cannot recommend this game. Cons: -Awful Hitreg -Unbalanced damage -Multiplayer is a campfest -Sliding is overpowered -Maps are unstrategic -Bad ranking system Pros: -Non P2W -Co-Op can be fun",

You will run into one of two scenarios: 1: You end up with one or more obvious hackers on your team who will run around headshotting everything they see. You'll barely be able to get any kills yourself, let alone accomplish any of the mission's challenge objectives (such as accumulating knife headshots or grenade multikills). Normally, I would consider this frustrating and bad enough on its own, if not for the following scenario which happens more often. 2: You end up with people on your team whom you'll swear are mentally defective, under the influence of narcotics, or both. You know the type: The ones who think it's hilarious to run around in the spawn knifing their teammates or wasting all their ammo shooting the inside of the helicopter, then decide the best strategy is to charge straight towards the enemy and attempt to defeat them by bludgeoning them with their own face. Then, when they inevitably die, they scream insults at you, call you a noob, yell things like GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO, or quit, leaving you to try to complete the mission with only one or two people, far less than the mission is clearly designed for. These people actually make me glad to be paired up with cheaters, because those runs are about the only ones you actually successfully complete.  Being paired with players who are both not cheating and not intolerable idiots is a fairly rare occasion.  This latter case wouldn't be so bad (after all, nearly every fps suffers from this to some degree) except that this is an MMOFPS with item rental and repair mechanics. And so not only are they wasting your time, they actually make you lose progression once you start to use weapons and armor that need to be repaired, which defeats the purpose of trying to get those items in the first place. Why would you spend hours trying to unlock cool gear just to have it become a tax upon your further attempts to acquire more cool gear? What's worse, I suspect that if you actually played long enough to get a full set of high-end equipment, it would not be sustainable. Your repair costs would be so high that you would be taking a loss on every match even if you won. Wtf?  Because of this repair mechanic and the awful community I really can't recommend this game to anyone.",

Adjust your system to detect hacking: most hackers have a very bad hit ratio, although they shoot and kill even on minimal sight. They must fire at random in between.

First guns, i realized that the guns i had was actually terrible and dealt no damage ( this isn't exactly the guns fault thougth ) i realized that there was armor who could give you benefits, example a armor can give you 50% more health and every bullet you put into the guy with vest was reduced by 20 dmg.  there also exist helms that reduces damage from headshots suddenly i need put 3-5 bullets into my enemies in order for them to actually die. i got so annoyed i even changed to a shotgun and went up close and shot a person straight into the chest, realizing he only took 40% damage and obviously was able to return the damage with a headshot that instant killed me.  There's also reapr cost, in case you should be able to receive all these nice armors,weapons, and so on you will be surprised to see you actually can't use them. why you might think. because there's a durability in this game so even if you earn 400$ a game ( ingame ) then you will realize it might take you 500$ to repair you armor so what you have achieved in the game is eventually actually just a waste because after maybe 50 games you need to repair your armor and you won't even be able to do that!   and even if you could you also need money to get new guns, you get some unlocked thougth clear progress but these guns just isn't as good as the pemium ones in the 'capsule shop' so otherwise you don't mind being a credit warrior and buythe Vip card which gives you Xp/$/vp benefits then you basically can't do alot on the game.  Honestly i liked this game and it's fun as long you keep being in the beginner channel, when you get into the proffesionel channel then it get's bored everyone have better armor, guns than you, and they might need 1 shot to kill you, yet you need 4-5.

Why not skip the middle man and just sync it to your steam account instead of having to sign up through your email? Not horrible, just a pain...but I did it anyway.  Download the update. Done.

Okay, this game has my attention.   After the tutorial, my husband tossed me an invite and a friend's request. I joined his game, got set up and hit ready. He clicks 'start'...nothing happens. He clicks start again...nothing happens. I unready myself and then hit ready again. He clicks start. Nothing happens. Clearly we're missing something, so I google it.
