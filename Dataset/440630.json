The ambience of the title screen had set my nerves from cool-as-a-cucumber to slight trepidation with what followed being utter terror. Having a gooey and festering corpse slowing inch towards me while I was armed with a knife was more than my now shattered sanity could take; wrist strap firmly secured I started spinning the blade like a fan while screaming GET BACK! GO AWAY! I decapitated said zombie, saw another one inching closer from behind me and said ♥♥♥♥ this; ripping the headset off I proceeded to curl up into a ball on the ground sobbing like a pre-pubescent little girl.  I have managed to progress further since my first experience but alas the game is still a cruel mistress, with many infected types to sneak up behind you when you least expect it for a truly pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience.",

You stand in one spot, listen for monsters, point your flashlight in that direction, confirm that something is there, and you shoot it until it dies. It gets good when multiple monsters are coming at you from different directions simultaneously, and you have to decide which to kill first with little or no time to think.",

You really need to take advantage of the upgrades and different weapons if you want to survive, this is not an easy game, you need to be accurate and fast or the zombies will eat you!!! Speaking of zombies...there are different kind of enemies that attack you: you first start with 'normal' slow zombies and then you finish fighting bigger, faster or more support-like foes, you really need to organize the defense and decide who to take out first because if you simply shoot the first thing you see you are going to get swarmed quickly! Hit detection is well made: you can remove the limbs of the zombies by simply shooting at them but watch it....even with no legs they won't stop!!!  I totally recommend this game, I'm playing with an amd r9 390 oc and an i5 2500k @4.5 GHz without issues.",

I have however encountered a few bugs...  -monsters tend to sometimes get stuck and not move. ( this saved my ♥♥♥ when being rushed by tanks lol ) -spider / baby monster thing tend to spawn and get stuck somewhere not viewable to the player same as above but happens on sewer / burnt forest levels.   over all a good play through and now i look forward to playing this on the higher difficulty.",

            "review_text": "Edit: The dev team is hard at work and making many tweaks...   Disclaimer:   I have not yet finnished the game. I'm on the sewar level.  If you liked the demo this is more of the same, but... toned down a bit.  Note: some of the bad is being taken on by future patches as announced by the Devs, so keep that in mind and keep in mind it does have a 'Yes' Recommendation from me.  The Bad: No difficulty setting, the first few levels are like a 'My first time in VR experience' so no matter how inept you are your survival odds are good.  No live ammo pick up, so they break everything into rounds. Between each round you have to re-select your load out, all of it. There is also a noticable wait after each round before the menu pops up. Combining all of these sort of kills the momentum of the game and takes an awesome situation you are getting into and turns it into a borring experience.  When you get a 'item' it blocks our part of your screen with a really bright notification that you can't look around and this both takes you out of the experience and blinds you while you are trying to see in their dark levels.   No Co-op  Voice acting... This was so bad it needed it's own line... please start over and issue an update. Could probably get someone from the comunity to do it for free even and you can just overlay it into the system replacing the track that's there now. Seriously, Zero emotion from the voice acting and it sounds like the person doing it is more interested in getting out of the studio to go watch 'Murder She Wrote' than anything else. A show so old that google is needed for anyone in this generation to know what it is.   The Good: It's polished The gun play feels good and aiming does require a bit of skill. Ammo counter on the gun is a nice touch and is placed in a way that it is not distracting but easy to access quickly. Good variety of mobs to deal with. Atomos-fear is great ;) Artwork on the levels is 'Decent' lot's of sharp edged plain jane walls, just a retextured box basically.. but there are a lot of really nicely drawn items as well and the mobs look great! Hit box reactions are good Positional audio is fantastic! You can tell exactly where the mobs are coming fom just through sound and it's fantastic and really helps add to the experience.    Over all, it's one of the most pollished experiences out there, but the lack of momentum and constant interuptions of the game world combined with the terrible voice acting and stationary placement gives this game a lower score in my book. Edit: upped score just a bit because of Dev team working so hard even after release to improve the game and listening to their fan base. That's something to be respected.  8/10",

Survival mode could be a bit better, most of my friend when I've had them play it were very confused when they bought a gun and it disappeared after one wave even though most require money from two waves. Also the thrown weapons still feel a little clunky and hard to get the hang of without a shooting range type area. Lastly, the melee weapons seem to do a little too much damage. Not that I'm saying the game is too easy with them, I just feel that the machete and flashlight both feel pretty similar in strength which seems a bit off.  Aside from those small complaints the game is great, it looks great, it feels great with the haptic feedback of the guns, and it sounds great. Put on some headphones and really get immersed into it.",

Gunplay is pretty good and for the first 30 minutes or so there is a sense of dread when you turn around and something hideous is there, but the suspense ends when the round does or even before that if you realize the 'zombies' are animated rather poorly and that when they get close they just strike the air that is within a couple of feet of you.   Story mode offers some good jump scares so far but I have yet to beat it as performance is lackluster on a OCed GTX 980 / i7 4790k @ 4.7ghz. Reprojection is necessary unless I further boost the decent GPU OC to very unstable levels (1500mhz~), which is a no go. I am unsure if the game scales with the GPU you have, so if you have a 970 or lower end 980 I would shy away from this title.   All in all still cool enough for $20, even if it is not a match for other gallery shooters I am sure it will sate people until a proper zombie VR game is out (Arizona Sunshine / Zombie Riot perhaps?) and I look forward to reading that it has been stabilized so I can finish playing it.",

Sometimes it can get repetitive throughout waves, although each level does feel different which is what keeps me playing. Sometimes a level will have zombies coming from stairs, through tunnels, through a broken wall, or sometimes just from any angle around me. It's pretty spooky too. In the first level a zombie breaks down a barrier on the wall and I actually screamed and my hands started to shake the rest of the wave because of how scared I was.   My only really big complaint is the lack of video settings. The game runs okay for me, but in certain areas I will experience jittering and I wish I could adjust the settings to prevent this. Game is beautiful though, maybe thebest looking game with a realistic art style I've played on the Vive. Story is stupid but I didn't buy the game expecting a good story, I played the demo and kept up on the news for this game so all I really expected was to just have a wave based survival zombie game with a progression system and that's exactly what I got.",

I am pleased with the game and I feel the devs want to add more into the content as well. So even as other people have posted thier own issues with what seems to be a lack of content, or interesting mechanics; you need to take a step back and ask what YOU really want from this. This is NOT a grand adventure or super interesting story that will grip you for the rest of your life. (however the story seems to be a inspired from the movie 'The Mist', which is kinda neat).  What this game gives you is a gun. You pul the trigger and nail the mutant monster. You try not to die.   Simple.   If you want an immersive shooting game that reminds of you House of the Dead meets Resident Evil, then you kinda have a goal in mind here.  Try the Demo. Like it?, the game will do well for you.

This game has a single massive pro: The spook is very real. The zombie creatures give off the same vibe as those in 28 Days Later and it is legitimately terrifying and panic-inducing, which is awesome. Sadly, that's just about the only positive thing I could say about it. The game generally feels like little more than a tech demo that was intended to show off how great VR is, than an actual 20$ release. Besides the background spook factor, after a while, the game feels like you're just waiting for zombies to walk into your gun. Here are my specific annoyances: -Sound design feels weak and low-budget. In a game like this, that can really take you out of the immersion. -Unbalanced weaponry. All the pistols are pretty much equally generic and average, the SMG guns are generally overpowered but run out of ammo way too quickly for it to feel like a viable option ever. The shotgun is dumb as heck, just because in a 360 degree VR FPS, close-quarter combat weapons are plain stupid since you have to patiently wait for the zombies to walk close up enough to you. And the revolver- oh boy. So overpowered that it not only renders all the other guns useless, but is so OP it makes the game boring. -The weapon attachments, charms, and special ammo types all feel ridiculously tacked-on and phony. I can tell that the developers probably only added this because they were insecure about the lack of content they had.  -Physics: Literally every enemy, when approaching me to attack within a foot or two, they *literally* did a harmless leap-frog over me before attacking me. I get that this is just a glitch, but in a game like this, it's immersion-breaking enough to be game-breaking. I'm panicking as they're approaching me, only for them to do this weird and totally-not-terrifying attack.  -AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL hitpoint display//gore tendencies. This is really the game-breaking issue. The enemies are animated so that when you shoot them on a zone of their body- pretty much only either arm or head- that body part awkwardly disappears. Where's the gore!?!?!? I would've expected/wanted in this kinda game a killing floor-esque gore system where the enemies feel brutally dismemberable. This game feels ultra low-budget and because of this, killing the zombies does not feel even close to satisfying. In a game like this, especially with such a lack of content, it's absolutely UNACCEPTABLE to have bland and unsatisfying gore.  Maybe 6 months ago when commercially available virtual reality was new, this would've (and rightfully should've) made a splash. New Vive titles, however, are teaching us a MUCH higher standard for shooting quality than this game has. For over 5$ or so, this game is a definite pass.",

This...game that showed up - after the intensely tension building demo - is just a ridicoulus joke. I'm not sure if it is because I've started experimenting with developing for VR myself, or because I have a specific expectation of game quality. If you have enough hype, and enough quickly-cobbled game code, maybe you can shell out a quick game to gain money off the consumers and put to sea in a yacht tomorrow. If you then reinvest some of that money, you just might be able chuck another quickly-done game together in a week and repeat grabbing the cash that these players keep throwing at you.

Given that UE4 has such an easy IK system, one could at least expect the monsters to somehow react to hits other than just playing the same animation over and over again. But nope. They don't. The sound samples are ok, but the mixing is poor - you can't ♥♥♥♥ing be serious that a gun fired about 30 degrees to the right of my face doesn't have a sound in my left ear. Literally, that's not how sounds work. The lighting. Oh dear, I don't even understand. A flare shot in a corridor causes everything around it to light up, with no shadows, but behind walls. And no, shadows in UE4 are neither hard to implement nor do they cost a large amount of performance. The levels seem to be just quickly chucked together with whatever asset the designer could find. And they're totally static. No gunshot decals, no physical reaction to shots, not even breaking windows. The UI is sluggish. A good way to increase the playtime but a boring thing for the player itself.  The hand menus are badly implemented, a simple radial menu that divides the menu in just as many parts as required would be totally easy to set up and probably fix it. Otherwise, graphics are ok (if you can ignore animations and lighting), but not optimized at all. UE4 easily pushes 90fps on a 980TI, yet this game had stutters here and there. It's like they've forgot actually baking the game. Gunplay? Horrible. You can't be serious with that artificial recoil. Either add proper vibration or don't, but don't ♥♥♥♥ing gimp the gun.  So all in all, this game is basically a new Sergey Titov title. I wish it was just a tad more polished so I could  bear playing it, but it isn't. Sadly, refunded.",

Gameplay is pretty slow, there were really not very times where the amount of zombies seemed challenging to me and most come at you very very slow. I haven't tried survival yet but thats probably a little better; it's a good game for a first timer VR person who wants a Zombie experience but not too intense of one.",

It thinks that the first controller turned on - is the left one. Which is not always true. * It feels unfinished and unpolished. * Red filter all over the view instead of a health indicator is really annoying and a bad choise. * Voice is bad. * Story is generic to the bone. * Clunky ui * No SLI support (must have for VR, IMO) * Very short (seems like it has 5 levels or so. although i didn't beat it, because is bored me)  If something ganges, i'll update the rewiev.",
