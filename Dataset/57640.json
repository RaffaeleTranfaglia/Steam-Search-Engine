            "review_text": "An excellent adventure game, one you should definitely play.  This is a point 'n' click adventure game, so I won't talk about the gameplay.However, I will state that the puzzles you have to solve are very interesting and challenging, yet not frustrating. You will have to use your brain, but will also have a lot of fun doing so, and there is always a feeling of satisfacion when you hear the audio cue indicating that you solved the puzzle.  The strongest thing about this game is it's story and everything related to it. You play as George Stobbart, a young American lawyer, and Nicole Collard, a French journalist, who get involved in a murder investigation that ends up leading them on a quest to find an ancient Templar treasure. The story is pretty interesting and it did keep me hooked to the screen despite not having a shocking twist or big reveal. A nice take on the Temlpars before the Den Brown era and the time when Templars have become,in my opinion, so overused that they have become annoying. It is a simple story of mistery and adventure, but quite an enjoyable one. Mostly thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting. It is a joy to listen to all the characters and their conversations, and the game is filled with entertaining side characters.It is truely amazing how much work was put into every character that comes in contact with the protagonists, to the point that you remember each and every one of them and some of their lines. The game has a serious tone most of the time, but just enough humor to keep a smile on your face. Conversation that include both George and Nicole are especially fun, since their common dialogue is some of the best in the game, and they have quickly become one of my favourite game couples.  An excellent story, great writing, awesome and fun puzzles. What more do you need for an excellent p'n'c adventure?",

            "review_text": "This game is a masterwork of how to make an adventure game and one of the very few adventure games that can live up to any classic Lucasarts titles. Top-notch voice acting doing justice to a script filled with laughs, sly wit, and over the top spoofs and in its own way is every bit as good of a narrative as the Dreamfall series.  Once you move away from the story elements Broken Sword shows itself in every way to be a superior game. The inventory system is better, the graphics have been updated, the puzzles mesh with the story, and the in-game hint system both manages to keep immersion intact while allowing the player to set their own level of difficulty, in saying that, it’s still the original content that steals the show.  It's impossible to objectively criticize the first instalment of the Broken Sword series without nit-picking. Perhaps the only fair criticism is that the puzzles are not super demanding even without the hints. However, the sad truth is the most of the challenge to the puzzles in other games comes from bad design, not intellectual sophistication. When all and said and done Broken Sword: TDC is the best adventure game because everything in it just works synergistically to keep the player to keep on playing. ",

At the time it was hailed as a fantastic game, and even now nearly 15/20 years on, I'd still consider it a game that's worth playing for the experience.   The art work still holds up, where as the animation is basic, and the voice acting has been poorly recorded, but I can forgive that. The voice acting itself is outrageous with some of the most over the top accents you'll ever here - Geordie accent included!  Some of the puzzles are still genuine headscratchers, but the good type - Mav, Priit and Saj attempted to help. Attempted.   The game felt a little long winded by the end, so I'd be interested to know which new scenes were added to the Director's Cut (as I'm not entirely sure they were needed). However, overall I'd recommend this to any PnC fans, but perhaps wait for the Trilogy in the sale if you're a curious bystander.",

Director's Cut version contains additional pieces of the story from the side of the secondary character, Nico. She's a playable character now in these few added bits and we discover some more background related to her that connects to the general story. There are also some added puzzles and some new graphics like portraits of characters when they talk, but that somtimes looks a bit out of place in contrast with the graphics of such an old game. However... They removed the few time critical puzzles where you had to do the right quickly to survive some danger. You can no longer die. The main character automatically knows the right thing to do in those moments. That's just one small regret, no biggie. This is great, play it.",

What I love about the game is the story line and the hint system. The story is actually engrossing and makes sense - the two protagonists are trying to solve a mystery involving the knights templar, leading the gameplayer down a path to understand their order and mission. The hints are great - they have a tiered system and it allows you to easily pick up from where you left off, even if it has been days since you logged on (great if you are a casual gamer!).  What I don't like is the often cumbersome animations. This is especially true if you are trying to go from one area to another but there is one short animation prior to leaving the area...you have to watch the character walk all the way across the screen, watch the animation, and then you move to the next room. When you're close to solving a puzzle, this gets rather annoying.   Otherwise, this is a fun, casual game.",

They are rightfully up there with the Lucasarts masterpieces such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango, and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. But the one thing that BS had in its favour that in some aspects elevated it above those games was the incredibly immersive and detailed story. The story was originally like The Da Vinci Code, before it was even a thing; rich, complex and based on history. It also had great, humourous dialogue, and the exploring element once more elevated it. You could pretty much look at anything, try using anything, and the game never held your hand in terms of completeing puzzles, making for a truly challenging game, in which a wrong move could have your character killed.  Broken Sword: Directors Cut has stripped back virtually all the things that made the original great. As someone who has played the original literally dozens of times, I knew from the opening sequence that something was wrong. I don't mind that they have interspersed a couple of new puzzles into the game, but the new animation is jarring and horribly static flash animation, as opposed to the original Disney-esque fluid cinematics from the original. But I quickly noticed that the cafe scene (which opens the original game) is missing a lot of things that I used to love looking at, and getting George's cynical or funny takes on. The dialogue has been halved, the puzzles have been halved, and its just a big mess. Some of the dialogue has been re-recorded for some reason, which is painfully obvious from a striking difference in audio quality.  I seriously love BS, but i feel like i paid for a DC and ended up with a Broken Sword: Lite instead. Remember when Monkey Island 2 first came out, and there was an option to play it with easier puzzles? This is basically that, but without the option of the full experience. Is there an original version of this on Steam? If so, i'd go for that.   EDIT: I've just been informed that the version on  GOG.com  comes with the option to play the original or the DC, so i would suggest getting that. The Steam version has no such option",

This game is about deductive reasoning and puzzle solving. I would say my overall experience is that it started off very strong--puzzles were difficult to solve, the next step wasn't always obvious but would take some time to figure out, and the story/dialogue was entertaining. As the game went on, I found the game to lose some of its earlier greatness. The actual puzzles were few and far between and it became less intuitive to figure out what you had to do. Some of the things you had to do were downright stupid and made no sense--one puzzle essentially makes you enter a set of numbers by tediously turning a wheel and pressing a button, and if you don't get every number right you have to start over again. If you try to go through the game without using hints, you end up using an oldschool RPG approach, procedurally asking every person about every piece of evidence you have and trying to use every piece of evidence on any interactive element in the game, which simply isn't fun. In about the last 15 minutes of the game they force a romance on the player between the very likeable French girl and the totally unlikeable American idiot who you are forced to play as for about 3/4 of the game. Also, the animations in the cutscenes are pretty bad. In summation, I found this game to be enjoyable some of the time--I do enjoy puzzles in which critical thinking is required, but it fell flat as far as plot, immersion, and consistent novelty. I'd give it about a 4/10--it had a few funny jokes in there. Most were cringe worthy, but a few landed.",

I know this game is a classic, but take that away and you don't have much left. I've played several, far better, far more intuitive adventure games than this and while, voice acting aside, it wasn't horrible, definitely not the top of the pile.",

            "review_text": "I would consider myself generally a fan of point and click adventure games, and this one comes recommended highly. Unfortunately I became bored about 1/3 of the way through and chugging through any of the remaining locations became a complete chore.  A lot of people would apparently disagree with me but I feel like there must be a nostalgia factor that I'm missing out on. Objectively speaking, this game would have been fantastic to experience in 1996. Plenty of witty banter and dialogue, and fluidly animated cutscenes. It's damn impressive how much animation is provided for random interactions that don't even advance the story in any way.  But that's sort of the problem. At first it's not a big deal- there are a few characters to interact with, and a few items in your inventory. It's neat to experience the combination of interactions. Until both categories grow larger and you suddently have to start asking every single person about every single item. Some interactions are over quickly, some take minutes to complete as the NPC tells you something inane. Speeding through interactions can become clunky as you watch your character stumble around the screen with their pathfinding alorithm only to show up at their destination and shrug their shoulders, a way of telling the player 'nope, that won't work.' Fine, but you could have just said that to begin with.  I was absolutely shocked to find out that apparently this Director's cut had substantial sections of dialogue missing. With each syllable of spoken dialogue I pray that the game takes mercy on me and makes it the last. And you guys wanted MORE?  You might argue that the superfluous dialogue is optional. You don't have to ask everyone about everything. Well, sometimes you do. Sometimes when the puzzle solutions are completely arbitrary you'll wander around for ages in hopes of obtaining a relevant clue, only to find that you forgot to use that one item on that one thing that gives you that one other thing. Because why wouldn't you need that one thing. Of course you need to take a tissue full of facepaint all the way to syria, to polish a statue, to sell to a tourist, to get fifty dollars, to buy a cab ride. Never mind that you've been eating, living, and travelling for days on your own budget. THE GAME HAS DECIDED THAT THIS IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN THING YOU WANT.  You might also argue that I have a short attention span. I want to know which one of you enjoyed pounding through minutes of dialogue with the shrill-voiced woman in the hotel just to get that room key.   The dialogue is not really witty. I laughed a few times because of how stupid it was.  The story is arbitrary and convoluted.   I didn't think I could enjoy a game like this so little.",
