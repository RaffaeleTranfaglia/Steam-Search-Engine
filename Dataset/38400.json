            "review_text": "Where to start with this game...  'It's a classic' would be a good place to start, I guess. I have no problems say that from the outset. It's only taken me 15 years to get around to play original Fallout, but I can see without a shadow of a doubt why it's so highly regarded.   Before you play this game make sure to download the Fallout Fixt mod, which is a very comprehensive community mod which fixes a lot of the bugs, and more importantly the resolution for modern monitors. Without this patch you'll more than likely experience a horrible rainbow pixalation effect during videos and gameplay.   Anyway...  Fallout is a turn-based RPG series which offers you various ways to tackle the game. Do you want to be a stealthy person, creeping around, pick pocketing your way to glory? Sure, why not! Do you want to be a smooth talking kinda guy who can talk his way in and out of trouble? Go on, be that guy! What about a bookworm who can use his brain to solve puzzles. Yup! And of course you can be a mix of all three, as well as a gun totting maniac! YEE-HAW! For my playthrough I used one of the pre-set characers (Albert) who was a Lawyer in a previous life and was set up with high charisma and speech skills. This opened up different dialogue trees throughout the game, which was nice.   Anyway, I enjoyed this game - I enjoyed it a lot. The characters are great, the voice acting (while limited) was pretty nice (though it did give away who the 'important' characters were) and the story itself was pretty deep. The game starts, as always, with you the 'Vault Dweller' leaving your vault for the first time to explore the wastelands. You're tasked with bringing back a water chip to save your vault before everyone dies of thirst!  There's a time limit to this, which (for me) cast a sense of urgency. Normally in Fallout games (Fallout 3 and New Vegas) I'm guilty of just going 'WHEEEEE' and exploring everywhere and not really caring what I'm doing. Yet in Fallout there's no time to explore, you've got to save lives! ... if you want to.   You see you don't NEED to save their lives, if you don't want to. In fact, you don't HAVE to do much in Fallout if you don't want to. It's not a narrow pathed experience, you can pretty much choose how you deal with the events in the game (and the end game cutscene will reflect on this at the end). A lot of games claim to be an open experience, and the actions you take reflecting on the game world, yet here's a game from 1997 which actually does that. I'm not sure it even heralds that fact that it does this. It just gets on with being a pretty damn good game.   This brings me on to another aspect of the game - the many different branches of the game. People react to you differently depending on what you're wearing, what you're wielding, and what you're intelligence or charisma is. I find that amaizng now (in 2014), so I can only imagine how mindblowing it was back in 1997 when the game was released. The 'simple' graphics by today's standards shouldn't distract you from what is a very complex game. There's a lot going on under the hood of this game and at times perhaps too much. My eyes were really opened up to this towards the end of the game when I was struggling with killing a certain mob. I had went about it 'head on' and was killed a number of times. Yet, after a night's sleep I came back with a different approach, a more sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s approach and it was so much easier, and strangely satisfying. I had killed the guy and he had never even seen me. OK, sure the wastelands were plunged into another 100 years of nuclear fallout in the process, but hey... I KILLED THE GUY!  However, even with the Fallout Fixt mod, the game can be prone to crash now and again. I'm not sure if it's the game's memory file getting too big or a conflict with Steam Overlay (wouldn't be a first), but towards the end of the game (and a lot of different quest outcomes) it started to become slightly unstable. So save REGULARLY!  Which brings me on to another thing. This is an 'old school' game. It will not autosave for you, you must take control of your own save files. If you die you won't be taken back to the next/recent checkpoint... you'll have to load up from the last point you saved.  This was the only thing I didn't like, but in the end I learned to live with it and it made me realise how pampered I had become as a gamer. I didn't have autosaves and 10 minute interval checkpoints when I was a kid and I still played games all the time back then. Yet, here I am as a grown man crying about dying and having to go back 20 minutes in the game because I had forgot to save... a lesson in life this game has given me. Also, this game is tough. REALLY tough. Depending on how you build your character, or which character you choose. You will die a lot. A lot.  So in closing...  If you're looking for an old school RPG experience than I'd recommend giving Fallout a try. I appreciate at time of writing they're no longer available on the Steam Store, or GOG, but hopefully they return one day, as they deserve to be played.",

My first fallout game that i played was fallout 4 so it was quite a journey changing from a fps to turn based strategy. I'll be simple and write pros and cons of this game, if you don't want to waste your time reading through that...i reccomend it 9/10  Pros: -Story is well written and completing quests really feels like a reward -Characters are very well done and you can hear an interesting story as well :) -Post apocaliptic California feels like a real post apocaliptic place, the vibe of this destroyed world is really well done -Weapons and thier sounds are awesome( it's about to get messy! ) -Music, music, music what else could I say, it's a masterpiece and no other fallout by now couldn't beat this thing, it's amazing -Quests are really fun sometimes( like exploring the glow)  Cons: -I'm a wrong kid born in a wrong time, therefor i don't really like the battle mechanic of this game but it keeps this game original -Quests tend break and that causes glitches and bugs, and some NPCs send you to a quest that you can't complete -I won't lie the game is pretty hard, even on normal difficulty   Final verdict: Altough old this game is still fun for any rpg fan or even better a fallout fan, fun quests, great world and cool weapons what's not to like :)",

You can go out and visit a good amount of towns and places to ultimately decide the fate of those who dwell there.. Along with completeing a sweet main storty. In the end it takes somthing like 5 minutes to recap everything you've done and the outcomes of everywhere so its in my opinion the best video game ending ever! Although Fallout 2 runs along the same lines but is roughly 2 to 3 times larger in content. Both great games.",

Hitler shaped a battered Germany into an economic superpower.  But war never changes.  In the 21st century, war was still waged over the resources that could be acquired. Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons: Petroleum and Uranium. For these resources, China would invade Alaska, the US would annex Canada, and the European Commonwealth would dissolve into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last remaining resources on Earth.  In 2077, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise.  A few were able to reach the relative safety of the large underground Vaults. Your family was part of that group that entered Vault Thirteen. Imprisoned safely behind the large Vault door, under a mountain of stone, a generation has lived without knowledge of the outside world.  Life in the Vault is about to change.",

I beat Fallout 1 and man was it good, for many reasons.The story starts out with a simple plot but then starts to get exciting later wich I won't spoil, and has some of the most interesting character, some of whom make an apperiance in future tittles, and the one of the best villians in any game to this day. The world was a blast to explore, with interesting places to explore, although not huge like current Fallout games. The character creation was great, and as much as I liked Fallout 4 the leveling system was dumbed down from its predisessors and quite awful, but Fallout 1 has a great leveling system with skills, attributes, perks wich any rpg gamer will love. Also the replay value is high with the ability to join raiders and kill everybody, to the choice to speak your way out of everthing and kill nobody, this game is solid and still lives up to this day. I highly recommend you go purchase this NOW!",

Fallout 1, in my opinion, offered a more immaginative and rpg like erxpereince cmpared to 3 and NV,  -You have verbose paragraphs full of description (might be a turnoff to some)  -Since characters aren't animated, you have to pay attention to their diologue to get important details about their character.   -Diologue is also varied. Unlike Fallout 4, here you do have to consider what you're saying. You could accidently anger the other person, or start a fight, or acidentally get contracted to kll somebody even though you just wanted to find some work becasue apparently the wasteland is an expensive place to live in.........yeah  -There is no pipboy telling you where to go, you hvae the overall goal of finding the water chip, but it's up to YOU to follow up on leads and tips. People tell you rumors or somethign they over heard and you follow up on that   -the wasteland truly feels dangerous, here the stats mean more than anything. You can't just walk to the right and fight a super mutant, you'll get killed. The snese of progression is real, and the scarcity of items like stimpaks and radaway make finding them feel so much better.  So, I'd recommend buying this if you want a more authentic rpg expereince in the fallout world. Note that you will be reading a lot of paragraphs since only 6 or 7 characters get their own animation and voice acting and you definetly will not know where to go your first time playing (though the game does offer a starting point so no worries). Don't be ashamed to look at a guide (this is a game from the 90s)",

The different situations that are faced all require different character builds and may cause the player want to rebuild their character, sometimes. Due to the system requirements, this game can be run on a potato; literally. Because of its replayability, good story, and the fact that it can basically run on any computer; I would highly recommend this game. Oh and btw cameplay can be a bit tough and confusing so I would highly advise figuring out how to play before you buy.",

Before Bethesda got the rights to the Fallout series and gave us the wonders of Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4, Fallout was owned by Interplay and Black Isle studios. The classic Fallout games (1-tactics) were isometric turn based rpgs with a heavy open world exploration aspect to them. Now, jumping away from the history lesson and back to the game at hand. Fallout is a gritty, post apocolyptic rpg set after a nuclear war. And it really shows, raiders, super mutuants, anything in this wastland can be a friend or most likely a foe. The game can be very diffucult if you don't know what to expect. Everything you encounter, from cave rats to the brotherhood of steel, can kill you. Here's some spoilers, so don't touch if you don't want the story ruined. Ready? Alright.    You're tasked by the overseer of vault 13 to find a new water chip for the vault, as the one they have has died and water is running low. Setting off into a cave and the huge wastes, you must find a water chip and destroy the ever looming threat of the supermutant army, led by the Master. Once you complete these tasks in any order you please, you return to the vault you just saved....only to be banished.    If you're looking for a long, difficult at times, classic rpg, you should turn to the classic Fallout series. A definite must buy for any rpg fan.",

            "review_text": "Released back in 1997,  Fallout  is still one of my favourite RPG's ever made. A spiritual successor to  Wasteland  with heavy influences from the 1981 movie  Mad Max , this is a true blue, old school CRPG, no kiddies allowed. Don't expect any level of hand holding here. You're meant to explore, investigate, and actually think about what you do. Dialogue has meaning, and if you say or do the wrong thing, you might just ♥♥♥♥ someone off so bad you'll be screwed out of a quest forever. The combat is simple, yet deep enough to be engaging. Battles are turn-based, with action points determining how much you can do each turn. Most of the combat is driven by some heavy dice roll ♥♥♥♥, so expect to be screwed over by a bad critical hit and lose all of your health in a single turn, when previous attack dealt zero damage.  Most of the map is empty space. Instead of walking everywhere, you travel on a world map to locations of interest, wherein the real ♥♥♥♥ happens. Ranging from small settlements to the ruined remains of ancient cities, these locations are teeming with mysteries to unravel, choices to make, people to meet, items to loot, and a bunch of people to murder, if you're feeling sadistic. Quests often involve multiple outcomes, with several offering the choice between two opposing sides. Whether you're a ruthless mercenary willing to take on any job, a generous saviour, or an evil monster, this game accommodates you, allowing you to approach the game any way you see fit.  The game's SPECIAL system offers a surprising amount of depth in character creation. Will you be a gun-toting wanderer who solves problems with his guns, or a smooth-talking snake who solves problems without ever resorting to violence? How about a strongman who smashes his foes with a sledgehammer but is so stupid he can't even carry a conversation with people? Yes, you can do that. No matter which perks you pick or what skills you invest in, you're character will always end up with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. With these systems, the player is given a great deal of options that allow them to fine-tune their character, creating a vastly unique playthrough each time.   The story, characters, and setting are all iconic at this point. Though much of its aesthetic is derivative in some way,  Fallout  carved a unique personality of its own regardless. The narrative is nothing too complicated, and yet it's well-written and impactful at the same time, leading up to one of the best endings in RPG history. There's only three quests in the main plot lines, but these are long involving journeys that will take you all across post-apocalyptic Southern California. As you go from town to town, new quests, jobs, and side activities will open up, which can ultimately serve your primary objectives as well. Know that there is a finite end to the content, however. Though there's a lot to see and do (my first playthrough clocked in at about sixty hours), the game ends once you've beaten the main quest, and outside of that, you can't explore every nook and cranny like you can in  Fallout: New Vegas . There's a limit to just how much you can do, but I feel this adds more to the experience, as it lends meaning to your actions. Don't expect to get every skill to a hundred and unlock every perk in a single playthrough.  As a game that came out in the late nineties, there are definitely some issues. First, there are major graphical bugs which can be fixed, but may persist nonetheless in more benign forms, which is to be expected of a game that's almost seventeen years old. Then there's some other annoying nitpicks, like unintuitive UI that feels clunky and the odd limitation like not being able to move more than 999 bottle caps at a time when bartering. The AI can be absolute garbage at times, too. Let's put it this way. There were times when I felt grateful that one of my followers was standing in a corner and not fighting, because that means he couldn't shoot me in the back. Without the ability to control your party, things can get pretty frustrating later in the game, when you're rolling with a huge posse to beat the final boss. Hint: save often, and in many slots.  So, would I reccomend this game? That depends. Are you looking for an old school CRPG with deep combat and meaningful choices and character growth? If so, then I'll be damned if you can find a better game than  Fallout .",

Outside of the graphics, the game is similar to Fallout 3, and Fallout New Vegas. You're SPECIAL stats, along with your Skills, largely determine how you'll play. However, the main difference will be the lack of real time play.  Onto the story, this is the game that started everything. Most of the series staples were implemented in this game.

With that being said, this game is enjoyable- i clocked in about 25 hours.   This game has many problems - bugs, broken and cut quests, outdated graphics(even with highrez mod), not fully fledged or connecting dialogue, outdated gameplay mechanics, having to optimize this game for your comp by yourself(THANKS STEAM...) and my main gripe that this game feels to me a beta for fallout 2 which most people say is the superior between the two.  I feel this game gets the classic nod, because of what it brings to the western rpg genre - a unique rpg system with perks, special stats and skills which affect the world around you, ambigous morality, interesting setting and lore, great story line, fairly good dialogue, random encounters.  AS a person who's first fallout game was New Vegas, i felt really out of place when i first dl this game. Its really difference and theirs a learning curve to it.  This game is old and outdated - this is true no argument about that. So it will affect my final score.  My Score system: 10/10 is a perect, 5/10 is average, and 0/10 Horrible.  This game is a 7/10, a good game. It should be played if your a fallout fan and have never touched this old cRPG classic. ",

Two bits of advice: read the manual (sad that they don't make them anymore), and don't patch or mod. Spent a long time (10+ hrs) playing a modded HD version found on the community pages, only to find out its completely bugged and unplayable. The vanilla steam verision plays better and has no bugs so far.

I finally purchased the classic collection to give it a go and see what I missed...  The gameplay is slowed down a lot in Fallout 1; it is turn-based, using AP(Action Points) each turn you have during combat to either move spaces, attack, reload, acess inventory etc. which took a while to get used to.   Other than the game being turn-based, it is still parallel to the newer games: - Character creation before you start  - You get a main quest before leaving the vault - Travel to towns and interact with numerous NPC's to aquire side quests - Looting system -'Open World' - The map uses a grid system where you don't see the character travelling the wastes, just a red dot moving to each grid square until at a main town/area and then the view changes.   There are some speedbumps you'll have to get used to if you played the newer games, as well the game is not forgiving at all. There are NO tutorials at all, and the game doesn't hold your hand on what to do during quests. But this does make the game more challenging and fun if you get passed the gripes.  I would recommend this game if you have already tried out the newer ones and want to try a different kind of Fallout. The game has aged well and the graphics still hold up.",

        {
            "review_text": "A classic isometric cRPG, set in a post-nuclear war California. The main storyline itself is interesting but short. The best experience you get is from wandering the wasteland, completing side quests, talking to people about their experiences in the wasteland, and getting powerful weapons and armour. Places and towns vary from the bunker of the brotherhood of steel, to the 'Boneyard' (a ruined Los Angeles).  The exploration is done differently from the bethesda fallout games. Instead of a continuous world like the elder scrolls games, you travel from place to place on an overhead map, going into real time when you enter areas and towns, or when you encounter enemies, like raiders, super mutants, and other special encounters as you travel across the wasteland. It's different, as it makes the wasteland seem more empty and barren (like a wasteland should be). The range of locations is large, from pristine pre-war vaults, to ruined cities, to gothic cathedrals, making each stop in the game world interesting.  Character creation is the most complex in the series, similar to that of pen and paper RPGs. SPECIAL is a system which determines your base stats, which you build upon with a plethora of skills, optional traits (most of which have both a good and bad effect on your build), and perks, which you gain every 3 levels (4 if you have the 'skilled' optional trait), which gives you benefits in different areas. This game depends alot on numbers and stats, so choosing the right build and developing correctly is crucial.   Combat is turn-based, and resembles table-top combat. It's difficult, but you won't be constantly dying. No cover mechanics to be found here. But this doesn't mean the combat isn't complex. Your character build is very important, and your stats influence what kind of approach is best. A high endurance and strength character, who specialises in melee combat, will do well up close, instead of shooting from afar. Aside from that, you have lots of weapons you can use, from shotguns and sniper rifles, to rocket launchers and mini guns. Unlike Fallout 4, which seemingly gives you the power armour quickly for some reason, you can get it through different ways, such as repairing a broken suit, or stealing one, each way requiring you to be part of the brotherhood of steel. On top of that, you can harden your power armour, making it even more durable.  Interactions with NPCs are interesting, and tell you more about the wasteland. Your interactions with them are constant. If you insult someone, they won't like you, they won't give you a job or a quest, or may even call on hired guards to kill you. This may seem simple nowadays, but it was cool to have back then. Important NPCs are shown with animated faces, and they can vary from paranoid businessman, to mutant ghouls. Your acts in the wasteland will change your reputation, and this will affect interactions with NPCs, which may lead to certain benefits or disadvantages.  The atmosphere in this game is some of the best in a game to date. Gritty, dark, but with a touch of sarcastic and black humour, this game obviously draws influence from films like a boy and his dog, Mad Max, and books like a canticle for Leibowitz. It's art direction draws on from the 1950's vision for the future, with robots looking like something from forbidden planet than from the terminator. The humour is sparse, but well placed in characters like Harold, who despite living in an immortal agony, he can still make a joke or two. The music adds to this, each track a poignant, ambient soundscape of the area you currently, filled with industrial creaks, whining winds, and sudden crashes of metal on metal, emphasising the unforgiving world you must surivive in, instead of constantly hearing about 'Butcher Pete', or whoever that is. Unlike Fallout 2, you won't have constant Monty Python references thrown in your face every random encounter, but there are some interesting ones, like a random encounter with the telephone box from doctor who.   This game is old (1997), and it shows. The enviroments look nice and detailed, but still have that pixely look. The UI can be confusing and off putting, and things like quests and missions are marked with little detail (e.g. 'Find the water chip'), which means you'll have to remember the vital quest details. The combat is VERY slow, but can be sped up in the options, though this won't do much if you have lots of enemies to fight. There's no auto-saving, and you'll need to save often, or when you get killed, you'll have to load a save you made ages back. The inventory isn't amazing, as you'll need to keep clicking down and up arrows to get what you want. Also, thanks to Bethesda, this version of the game is the UK censored edition, removing swearing and other adult themes from the game entirely, as well as a poor port which you need to use patches to fix the resolution. This game is about a nuclear wasteland, where all hope for humanity is gone, mutants roam around killing people, and the only known technological power that isn't killing everyone (The Brotherhood of Steel), won't communicate with the outside world. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU REMOVE A BIT OF SWEARING!? If I wanted a family-friendly game, I would play lego star wars.   Overall, Fallout is an awesome game. Complex, with alot of custimisation, interactions and exploration, in a very large and dangerous world. However, confusing UI and quest tracking, along with some features some new players may find very annoying, means you'll need to get used it, though it is definitely worth it.",

            "review_text": "I must admit that I didn't fall in love with the original games, but rather, with the Bethesda-era ones. My first game in the series was Fallout 2 and while I LOVE older games like this, there was just something that didn't capture my attention like NV eventually did, which thankfully got me into the whole series.  That being said, after playing countless hours of 3, NV, and 4, I decided to come back and have another go at completing the originals, going in order. I haven't quite finished this game's main quest, in fact I haven't really even come close, but I have to say that these games are far more enjoyable when you understand the game's universe and decide to force yourself to be patient with an unforgiving game. Typically, I don't like brutally tough games because I play games for enjoyment rather than overabundance of challenge, but once you get the hang of it, the challenge in this game goes hand-in-hand with the choice and depth.  I will say that for a game of its age, it looks pretty good. However, my complaint is that because they went with the isometric approach, I find it harder to actually become immersed in the world itself. Instead, I find myself revisiting my childhood as I see images of 90s-era 3D in my head, trying to imagine what it would have looked like had they made it in first-person like Bethesda did with their games. I like isometric games, one of my favorites being the first two Rollercoaster Tycoon games, but for a semi-depressing, deep RPG with questions of morality, it feels lacking in the immersion factor.  Where the graphics are lacking, the gameplay and story make up for it though. I have to say I despise the combat system mostly because you're locked into a single decision every round, but the turn-based system does allow for far more decisionmaking and strategy in combat which is nice. I can't begin to describe how many times I've died in the more recent games simply because the in-the-moment decisionmaking pressured me into pulling off a stupid move, so the turn-based system helps prevent that. I don't care much for the random encounters either, as they get annoying when you're trying to travel.  The world itself is well-designed, despite the graphics being less immersive. The stylization gives a depressing, dark atmosphere of a ruined world, and there is something about that era of graphics/design that really hits you just right. The world isn't extremely open-world, but this isn't meant to be an open-world RPG. You use a fast travel type system between cities, settlements, regions and you're often interrupted by random encounters in the middle of nowhere. The larger cities/dungeons themselves tend to be split into several separate maps. There isn't a whole lot of variety in environment design but it doesn't need it. In general, the world captures you in a way you can't really describe with words, though not really by immersion factor.  The story is entertaining, and it's fun to be able to basically carve your own path to your endgame objective, as RPGs are meant to be. The story begins simply, but then begins to expand until you realize it's a plot larger than you could have imagined. It involves choice in ridiculous amounts, not to mention it tries to reaffirm the series motto: 'War... war never changes.' by showing that despite destroying ourselves, humanity is still its selfish old self, yet we also have the capability of goodness and love.  I apologize that this review was kind of scatterbrained, but I can't really do an appropriate review until I finish the game in its entirety like I have with the newer ones. Altogether, despite my complaints with this game and the original games in general, I do strongly recommend this game both for Fallout fans seeking nostalgia and for fans of traditional deep RPGs with a turn-based combat system. It's a load of fun, particularly once you get the hang of how it works.",

I know that one could just look up the controls, or somehow find them in the game in some place where I haven't checked, but you really feel like someone in a new world the first time you exit the Vault. You're just thrown into it, and you have to figure it all out on your own.  I haven't played much of it at the time of writing this review, but I can already tell I'm gonna enjoy this game. As a person who played Fallout 3 before this game, I can say that it was certainly different, but that doesn't mean that it's bad! I mean, if I can play a game where I can get stuck fighting rats for 10 minutes, finally leave the Vault entrance, find a settlement, get instantly tasked with a mission from people I don't know, help said unknown people, go to another Vault and get killed in said Vault by a Mole Rat, only to discover I didn't save and restart, all within the span of about two hours, then I know that I'm gonna love the game.  It doesn't mess around. Even if the saving bit is a bit of a pain, it certainly makes a person learn to keep track of it all of the time! This is a game where you have to learn quick and think quick.....and learn to not rage quit when you get almost two hours into the game and end up dead, only to realize that, not only did you die after playing that long, you also didn't save except for the one time when you were trying to learn the controls.",

Fallout, however, keeps me coming back consistantly despite how often I decide to try out a new build. It's definitely antiquated, but that shouldn't be a huge problem. If you started the Fallout series with one of the newer games (As I did), then the Isometric camera, turn based combat, and MUCH more open ended gameplay may take a bit of adjusting, but it's definitely worth perservering.

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I have previously played Fallout 3 and enjoyed both the game and universe. That being said, I looked into the original games a bit before purchasing to see what type of gameplay it was.  The Basics: This game has a top-down view with turn-based combat. The game came out in 1997, so the graphics are starting to show their age.  My Opinion: I didn't care for this game at all. There are two big things that ruined the game for me: poor direction and terrible combat.  When it comes to quests, I would like some for of, 'the main mission/quest is in this general direction.' I want some idea of knowing how I can progress. I am not asking for the game to hold my hand. I actually don't care for games that hold my hand. However, I shouldn't have to look at a walkthrough to tell me where I have to go for the main story. It would be one thing if I didn't know where to find a side mission/quest. Sometimes people get lost in games, sure. You start out lost at the beginning of the game with no sense of direction in a cave.  The combat was the second issue I had. It's clunky and bland. Maybe I just didn't play far enough into the game, but it just felt sloppy and wasn't engaging. It didn't feel like I was able to do anything. You start off with all of your items, and weapons, in your bag. You have nothing equpped. Take a few steps forward and you are in your first battle. Now, almost every single game I have ever played has you start with a weapon equipped, or you fight to gain that first weapon. As I said, you have your first weapon, why the hell is it not equipped or tell you to check inventory? So after you either fail or realize, 'oh hey, I have a ♥♥♥♥ing gun that nobody told me about,' you finally equip it. Now you can fight rats and point blank range with a gun. You shoot, you miss. You shoot again, you miss again. Meanwhile, this rat is going to beat the hell out of you and you lose half of your health while shooting and outline of the rat around him.  Conclusion: This game isn't for me. The sloppy direction and combat are what drove me away. Maybe the game is too dated. Maybe if I had tried it a few years soon, I might have been able to enjoy it. The fact is that now I don't find the game enjoyable at all.  3/10",

            "review_text": "Really slow and quite boring to play. Since I played the newer games first I probably grew to expect fast paced combat in all the games, but instead you get slow, and I mean SLOW, turned based combat.   The action point system really annoys me as well, Ive got like a 9 out of 10 for agility or endurance (or whatever) in my stats which I expected, like in the newer games, would make me run faster and for longer but Ive got like 10 'action points' instead which I know sounds big and you think you might be able to do loads of stuff with them, but each 'action' takes about 3 or 4 points, so you end up only being able to do like 2 things per turn. Oh and by action, I mean: Walk around, look in inventory (which takes 3 action points by the way), shoot/attack something, look at something, or literally anything really. So when compared to the incredibly slow combat, with you maybe, (if your lucky) getting 2 shots, or attacks, on an enemy each turn, you get an even more slow and boring game.  The story isnt that great also. All you need to do is get a water chip or something so your told to go to another vault and find one, so then when you get there you're literally just told: 'OH ITS NOT HERE, PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN'. I got bored after that and just stopped.   The game makes me feel really tired, honestly about 30 minutes of gameplay and I need to quit otherwise I might fall asleep.   I know that Im being harsh but because I grew with the newer generation Fallout games like Fallout 3 and New Vegas I felt really disappointed by this one. This is just my opinion by the way but if you do get bored quickly and if you hate slow gameplay then this is NOT the game for you.   I give it about 4.5/10",

Due to that, I can't give it a good up rating, if you can get by all that though and the constricted and sometimes boring gameplay, it's great, not that it's boring either, but sometimes it can get boring, not much replay value here.  For what it's worth, it's a good first time game, you'll have a bit of fun if you enjoy this type of game, but as I've discovered enjoying these types of games isn't enough for a second or third playthrough.",
