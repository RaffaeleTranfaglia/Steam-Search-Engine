    "description": "Have you ever wondered if your room is too small to swing a cat? Disclaimer: We have no responsibility should the answer be 'No' and you hit your controller based cat off a wall, monitor, television or significant other. Swing your cat around, build up speed and let it go! How far will it go? No one knows.",
