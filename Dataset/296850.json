            "review_text": "This is a game from another decade. A time when adventure games had lots of screens, many of which were just graphical interludes to walk through. Where your inventory quickly swelled with dozens of items, and visual clues telling you what to pick up were considered patronizing.Al Emmo isn’t just old-school; it’s total old-school immersion that’ll thrill genre-lovers and the pathologically curious. It does its best to be funny, with an every-line-as-joke approach similar to Sam &amp; Max.Interacting with the environment uses a similar method to Full Throttle, where you can interact with anything using your hand (examine), eyes (get/use) or tongue (speak). It’s not as elegant as the LucasArts implementation, but serves its purpose well enough.Puzzles are, with a few exceptions, all inventory-based, although there are a few light action sequences. There are a few clunkers in the bunch, but most of the puzzles that I came up against maintained the right balance between challenging and frustrating. On the music front, there's not much to be said. I found the score fairly negligible, consisting mostly of variations on old west themes that we've heard in pretty much every western game that's come out before this one. While I was quite impressed with the content of the game, Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine is probably one of the tougher games to recommend, as much will depend on what people expect. For those seeking a complete throwback to the classic adventures of old, Al Emmo certainly delivers in many respects.",

            "review_text": "I played the original version of Al Emmo back in the days when it was first released in 2007, I beleive. It's nice to see that things have been continually improved upon in this new Steam edition with enhancements to both the visuals and voices. I think this is a rather under-rated adventure game, tbh. Game has many throwbacks to retro Sierra adventures. The game world has unique narration vocals for everything you can possibly look, interact and talk with! And every inventory item in the game has NPCs saying unique lines when showing them your items. In an era where most new adventure games trim the fat, so to speak, by limiting interactions and forcing players to use a single 'smart' cursor to cover all interactions, it's refreshing to see this adventure has a very descriptive world where the level of interactive modes and descriptions invites you to explore further instead of just guiding you along a binary path where they can either interact or not interact with a hotspot. The characters were all interesting enough to hold my attention and the story is just 'there', I suppose, but it never left me feeling bored or made my thoughts wander off. This game's sense of humor will probably resonate more with some people than others, as much of the humor is slapstick innuendo. Personally, I liked it and felt the quality of the writing was quite high. Your mileage may vary with the jokes though. Puzzles were well placed and seemed to be set to just the right difficulty. I was never stumped for too long, but also never really felt that anything was unfairly illogical. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Al Emmo and it's a recommend from me.",

            "review_text": "I can confirm all another player said about this game and more, the constant innuendo, the constant and thinly veiled sexual reference, potty humor, and really 'jokes' that are just so snarky and poorly written make up the bulk of this game. I mean it, this is probably the filthiest game i've seen on steam, not filthy like buxom zombies of Dead Island, but filthy like dirty old man gives me the creeps everytime he opens his stank hole and sounds come pouring out kind of filthy.  The engine is acceptable, the art is acceptable, the way items are handled, all classic point/click adventure, but it is entirely wasted by this niche marketing. This is the adventure game equivalent of a stupid drunken idiotic 'Spring Break' Z rated teen movie.  I wish I could scrub the activity from my profile, but the only reason I ever stuck with this game was for playfire rewards, which works based on obtaining certain achievements.  This game could've been fun for the whole family, were it not for the writing/storyline. Definitely not my cup of tea.",
