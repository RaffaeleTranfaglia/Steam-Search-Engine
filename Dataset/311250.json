This third chapter boasts a higher budget and a better understanding of horror making this the best chapter to date.  For a budget horror game, this isn’t bad at all. I was genuinely scared while playing it! ",

            "review_text": "This game is good, but certainly not splendid. It's kind of similar to a slightly inferior version of Outlast. You play the 'prey' instead of the 'predator' as you are chased by monsters through creepy environments. The concept behind the game is fine, and it has some good music as well as significant visuals. The main issue is that it's extremely simplistic. The character you play really doesn't have many choices to make. There's either 'the right way or the wrong way.' The main optional portions of the game are the little 'treasure hunts' for relics, which just require you to have a keen eye and wander off the beaten path a bit.  The storyline is very comparable to many games from the past, and the maps aren't exceptionally large. Doorways Underworld is decent, but it's kind of short. I was able to complete it in 3 to 4 hours. The current price is $10, which I feel is suitable. I certainly wouldn't be able to recommend it for $40, but I think it would be a steal at $5.  Not a bad first attempt for Argentine game developers. I'm sure they will have plenty of feedback for customers for improvement.",

            "review_text": "Both positive and negative points to this. Loved Doorways 1&amp;2 so obviously got this one. Being someone who is terrified of horror but can't stop playing them it had a few good jump scares in there to get my heart racing. But that was about it.   Pro's - Boss type characters that you have to avoid whilst working out puzzles  Occasional Jump Scares  Atmospheric music / sounds  A lot easier to follow than the first two Doorways and more interesting, possibly due to the addition of more boss type characters.  Con's - Puzzles get very repetitive very quickly. Currently given up playing it due to the very last maze where it took me over 30 hours to use flash back (slows time) which materialises the boss infront of you - in order to get to a timed switch only to realise I had to do the same thing AGAIN afterwards on a larger scale. No thanks!  Wasted opportunity for further jump scares. When the head lamp flickers / under water.   Over all enjoyed it greatly until the very end. Looking forward to the next installment in the series. All places played in this time felt very similar, dark dank caves. The hospital could of been expanded on greatly and used for great scare tactics. Also hoping for a larger range of puzzles, not the same ones repeated on bigger scales.",

            "review_text": "Doorways Chapter 3 did manage to hold together the atmosphere, dark storyline, and the great voice-acting of the main character for awhile. However, the time trials area after the hospital interrupted the flow and became tedious very quickly. Time trials themselves are not necessarily bad, but for a game that relies on psychological horror, they need to be used only a few times at most, and making them too difficult and too overcomplicated only leads to frustrating the player and ruining the carefully crafted atmosphere that made Doorways popular.  Case in point: After exiting the operating theater, you end up in mazelike corridors with a map and the flashback ability. You now have to do time trials where you need to hit the lever and run back to a doorway and go through before the timer runs out. Now, while it started out somewhat challenging, it wasn't too difficult or complicated. It worked with the atmosphere alright, and if it had stopped here, I'd be giving a more positive review.  No, first, the map was purposefully made to be useless. You cannot run with the map in a readable position, so running to beat a seemingly endless stream of time trials meant running through confusing mazes on memory. But the big mistake here was trying to combine the Flashback ability with the time trials. Flashback slows down time, which is absolutely necessary for the later time trials. However, it also summons the monster, which appears very nearby, with the possibility of appearing on any side of the player, including right in front of them.  So, how do you time it so the monster doesn't instantly kill you? Is it based on where you stand? Maybe, but when you've got a ridiculous time limit to meet, a map you can't use, and a constant need to keep reactivating flashback, beating the time limit and escaping the monster becomes pure luck. As I've already said, they threw way too many mechanics together at once in these trials, which only made the problem of the game having too many time trials already worse. The atmosphere that Doorways relies on was runined.  I understand that challenge is important in a game, and the team tried to do something new and challenging with the time trials, but they don't fit with the atmosphere of the game, and honestly if the developers had given a skip button for the time trials, I would've gotten a greater feeling of satisfaction from clicking that button than I would've gotten from actually beating the time trials for real. That's the point where challenging becomes tedious, which doesn't belong in any game, Doorways especially.  Anyway, the first few levels might make fans of the series happy, but once the time trials start, the game as a whole is likely going to turn into a disappointment for them.",

            "review_text": "A continuation of Prelude with again some really twisted visuals.  Definitely looking better. Puzzles are about the same: look for items and use them to open doors and such, but there's a new level to it. A sort of parallel reality by using a flashback amulet, looking both back in time and interacting with objects.  Plus there are monsters. Monsters that chase you. And while that sounds like a lot of fun (it mostly is), in one particular case (the maze) it can become quite annoying because it requires a lot of trial and error and even some blind luck to get through the last part of that maze. Although, probably there was some more logic to it which I just didn't see.  So, like Prelude, The Underworld is a disturbingly fun game. ",

            "review_text": "This review is my review from Rely on Horror, a gaming website for horror game enthusiasts, by horror game enthusiasts. If you like horror games, you should check it out. /plug. Full disclosure, I was given a review copy of Underworld and my achievements didn't work in the game.   Doorways: The Underworld is the latest chapter in the Doorways saga from Saibot Studios. It can be played as part of the Doorways saga, or as a stand-alone title. If you want to pick up this game after this review and are concerned about missing something, you can check out last year’s hands-on playthrough of the first two episodes. I didn’t play the first two chapters, but since The Underworld is supposed to be able to stand on its own, it should be treated as such.  The basic gist of the story is that you are a Doorways agent, sent after a psychotic killer that other agents couldn’t handle. You’ve seen the worst of the worst and you, and only you alone can catch them. To find them, you will use psychic abilities and see through their eyes. Underworld tasks you with hunting down a demented doctor, performing gruesome experiments on human patients. I’ll discuss more on the story a little later.  I will give credit where it is due – Doorways does some things pretty well, however in each of those instances it also shoots itself in the foot and slits its own throat. It’s as if Saibot was on course to deliver a great game, but they overshot the runway and made a crash landing. The wreckage could still be considered a horror game, but probably not the best iteration of one.  The game is decent enough to look at . It’s dark, and when combined with its sound and voice acting, really sells that feeling of dread and fear that horror fans pine for. The game is a little too dark unfortunately, and I had to crank up the brightness settings just so I could see where I was going. This caused me to see that there was a lot of stuff in the environment, but it didn’t really do anything. Some papers to find, but nothing else. I have to mention that you don’t have any hands or arms here – items just sort of float in front of you and instead of a flashlight, you have a headlamp. I see that neither as a pro or a con, I’d rather have floating items than poorly animated arms flailing in front of me (no one does arms and hands right). But to have an environment with so much stuff, yet is still so empty, is kind of a downer.  Immediately noticeable when I first fired the game up was that it used sound effectively to – again – sell that feeling of dread. However my feelings towards it turned from admiration to admonition by the time the first level as over. That’s about how long it took for me to discover that the ambient audio doesn’t really match with what’s happening onscreen. And while each level’s audio is different, there’s a defined loop in each level, and it all sounds the same. There are certain peaks in the audio, where the intention must have been to send chills down your spine and make you think something was about to happen, but it never does. There’s that slow build-up, but no payoff. Even the voice-acting, as well done as it is, sounds a little ham fisted at times.  The game is a horror puzzler, but the puzzles consist of little more than irritating key searches. A good key search never hurt anyone, but not if that’s all that it is. The game is devoid of combat, so you’re forced to rely on stealth at certain times. I foolishly believed that this meant the game was devoid of enemies entirely, leading me to charge headfirst into the first enemy I saw and die rather hilariously. I thought it was a hallucination. Player idiocy aside, gameplay amounts to little more than these key searches, and hiding from that one enemy in each level. It’s padded out by making you traipse across the level once or twice before you find a paper or something that details that level’s enemy, then you go back to trek across the level again (because the key you have is for a door/lever/switch on the opposite side of the level) and SURPRISE! That enemy is now lurking in the hallways!  Once you use that key you’ve got, you may have to go back and find another one, or it’s time for a chase sequence! The first chase sequence that I experienced, I thought was really well done, but I was significantly less enthused the more I saw it repeated. If the enemy catches you, a little cutscene plays without much other fanfare. You’re killed instantly, which is sad, because I wanted to see more of these enemies.  Doorways has some good ideas, but they just don’t seem to be used to their potential. Those psychic abilities? Might as well be non-existent, I still don’t even know how they’re supposed to work, actually. The story? I mentioned that I would speak more on it, but there’s nothing more to say. No exposition provided as to who you are and why you’re doing this, who the doctor is and why she’s doing this, nothing outside of a piece of paper.  The final nail in Doorways’ coffin is that there’s nothing in the game that makes you want to keep playing it. There’s no pull to make you keep trudging down those dark hallways, it made playing the game a chore. To rub salt in the wound, the whole thing culminates in a long chase sequence with one of the most unsatisfying endings I’ve ever seen. Credits roll. That’s it – not even so much as a heave and a sigh to say that it’s over. Is it? I don’t know.  Check out  www.relyonhorror.com  for more reviews and news on horror games!",
