Top marks for the music and sound design, helping to fully immerse the player in the Star Wars universe. Main missions are wrapped up within a few hours, but achieving gold on every level gives some extra challenge.  Last point, some complained of controller compatibility. I didn't experience issues at all (playing on a XBox 360 controller).  Will the dark side keep us from having 'Rogue Squadron 2 : Rogue Leader' released on Steam ??",

            "review_text": "I remember playin' this roughly seventeen years ago; although, it was the N64 version. Any pros and cons, you ask? I do have a few pros, but absolutely no cons! *thinks a bit* Well, maybe one con. Nothin' to do with the game itself, though!  Pros: - Nostalgia! (Only for those who played it on the N64. Hopefully, most of y'all!)  - Your ship has unlimited ammo; and your guns don't overheat. (Not that they do in the Star Wars Universe)  - The levels are really fun! However, I must warn you, as in the N64 version, the re-release has timed levels as well!  - Let's say you want to abort a mission because you want to go to bed, or need to take a break from gaming, and you get a 'Failed'; don't worry, because it WILL NOT count against your profile!  -Slightly different way to make your profile than on the N64. Instead of choosing 'Select Game', you are presented a roster. Instead of three letters (can be one's initials), you can type a full name (example: Dash Rendar, Luke Skywalker, etc.) which I am very pleased! So, yeah, startin' to feel old just sayin' that!  Con(s): - Some people make the mistake of getting a game like this, and finding out that they need a joystick or console controller in order to easily play this game; please don't be one of them! The joystick I have, the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, is at least $30. Price of the joystick various, though, on the store you get it from!  Before I conclude in rating this game, I must share with you a tip that has served me well!  Tip: Always let your compass be your guide!  My rating for this game: Solid 5/5!",

            "review_text": "An undeniable classic of a game and I am extremely grateful it was re-released on Steam! It's an extremely fast-paced combat flight game! Do not let that sound intimidating, however! It may be fast and frantic, but is not overwhelming! In addition, being the last one flying in one piece is ever so satisfying, with a sense of accomplishment! (A great balance of difficulty, I feel!) Add to that the extremely responsive and easy flying controls! Despite the game's physical age, it is extremely fun to play, to this very day, even for newcomers to the Rogue Squadron series! The game itself is quite short, able to be 100% complete, within a couple of hours, gold medals and all! However, newcomers have much offered to them, I feel! (When I was young, during the N64 days, each mission took me multiple tries!) Well worth the asking price! And for the icing on the cake... It shows my all-time favourite Star Wars spacecraft the love it deserves... The A-Wing! (Always my ship of choice!) That being said, there is a ship to suit anyone's playstyle! You have the balanced X-Wings, for balanced speed, defense and firepower (Plus Artoo, for in-flight repairs!) You have the A-Wing for very fast, but very frail combat! Conversely, the Y-wings for flying tanks, that move like a flying fortress would! Those are the main three styles of ship, but there are so many more on offer, here, like many's favourite: The Millenium Falcon! Highly recommended to any combat-flight and/or Star Wars fan! (You need not even be a Star Wars fan, to appreciate the sheer fun-factor, here!)  Only downside? ... No more games are being made for this amazing series!",

            "review_text": "Ignore the fanboys. This game only has a high rating because of nostalgia. And to be fair, the game was awesome and is still lots of fun to play.  Or at least it would be, if this wasn't a terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port and a blatant cash grab.   There is virtually zero effort made here to make this game work on modern machines. The default mouse and keyboad controls are the worst I have EVER seen in a game, to a point of beng utterly useless. This would be fine if the game had proper controller support, but shockingly the controller support is actually terrible. The game doesn't even detect my ps4 controller, and even after I used Xpadder to make my ps4 controller work and mapped the in-game keys to it the controls were terrible and very unsmooth.  The graphics options aren't very good either, with there being no option to play the game at any modern resolutions. I hope you enjoy pixelated graphics!   Simply put, I feel ripped off even though I only payed 10 bucks for this. Unless you just so happen to have a joystick that works perfectly with this, this isn't playable. Since this is a re-release, this is not acceptable in any way.   I will probably ask for a steam refund, but first I want to see if doing so will make this review will go away. If it does, then I won't refund the game so that this review will stay here as a warning to others. Ignore the hype and the high rating, this port is ♥♥♥♥♥.",

            "review_text": "Oh, man, this game... You will need a gaming controller for this game (360/XONE/PS3/PS4/Steam/Whatever). Don't even think about trying this on keyboard. You'll thank me later.  I remember this game extremely well from the N64 era. Though I imagine for a lot of people, you might remember Shadows of the Empire better than this game, it's still a worthy entry to the Star Wars series, set between Episodes 4 and 5 of the movie series. I spent countless hours in the original flying around, blasting the Empire's forces to pieces, and eventually I got the Gold Medal for every single mission in the game (No easy task, especially on some missions).  Update #2 (April 3): I've now Gold Medalled every mission in this release of the game too, so I can verify they're all doable.  Now that the PC rerelease is out, consider this game if you're a Star Wars fan. Especially if you're into the air combat aspect of Star Wars games.Unfortunately, there's no space combat to speak of in this game (Even when you play one of the bonus missions), so if you're here looking for epic Star Wars-themed space battles.... Look for a different game (Sorry)  For you newcomers who are finding this game for the first time on Steam, do NOT expect it to be an easy flythrough and romp through the Star Wars universe. Expect to fail/Game Over many missions repeatedly before passing them. It does become a lot easier once you know what to do and where enemies spawn to reach for many of the elusive Gold Medals, but focus on passing the mission first, and worry about medals and extra stuff after.  And finally, don't expect this game to be like Ace Combat, because it really isn't. Take it for what it's worth and you'll have a good time blowing stuff up.  Update: After playing with the Steam Port for a bit, the camera is a bit clunky at first and takes some getting used to (You'll be changing it a fair bit to force the game to refocus on the ship, I recommend playing Level 1 repeatedly until you Gold it). And maybe it's just me, but the ships themselves aren't as nimble as I remember... Or maybe it's just been so long since my last playthrough that I'm rusty...  Now excuse me while I swipe an X-wing and blow up some more Imperial forces...",

I remeber begging people on the street for change just so i can rent this at blockbuster video (Yea Blockbuster remeber that? You millenialls can't handle that blockbuster lol). Other than the movies this game drove me further into the star wars mythos.   Anyway on to the review. Even though the game was made way back into the late 90's (1998 top be exact) the game holds up okay. It debuted on the N64 what do you expect? defintely a great throw back game.  Pros  Nostalgia gaming Controls (meh) Graphics are okay Voice acting was okay then, okay now I guess Remeber this is Nostalgia gaming if you never expierenced rouge squadron back then you might not like it.  Cons: music is meh controls are the first to ♥♥♥♥ you off because you have to spend time tweeking your PC controller if not your mouse and keyboard. 3 LIVES FOR EACH BOARD??????? (again 1998 game). blocky graphics ( I know its an old game but the graphics kind of stick out like a sore thumb ) Each level not explained well and thrown right into game.  Thats just some Pros/Cons of the top of my head. Overall I recommend buying this game for Nostalgia purposes. it doesn't bring anything new to the whole gaming franchise being that it was a first of the series, and wasn't that revolutionary for flight games, its was just very fun to play. And as a kid growing up with Star Wars this game has a special spot in my heart. Have Fun.",
