    "description": "Inspired by RPG map in &quot;Warcraft III&quot; , the core gameplay is plunder resources from enemies. This game is not only a simple thief, but also a test of the collocation between the various defensive towers, as well as a balance between the defense tower injury and the enemy's blood volume.",
