            "review_text": "Noticing all the strange reviews and whirlwind of drama, i need to say that i don't know anyone involved in the creation of this game before i write this reivew.  Being a furry i was intrigued by the premise of this game, it's catered to my community, i'll give it a go, support my fellows, all that. I start up the game, i see some interesting title art, and hear some very enjoyable title music, i sat there for a few minutes listening to it, getting myself prepared for a great furry based game!  Unfortunately, the title panel is where the enjoyment happens to end, because immediately you are met with what can only be described as the super-tsunami tidal wave of text. That's literally all this is, layer upon layer, upon layer of text, and literally nothing else. The game continuously boasts choices but in the entire first chapter (Which SHOULD be the set up for the entire coming game) i was only really given about two choices that were likely to change anything. Meaning the whole point behind this game, i.e the choices actually crops up an exceedingly small amount, however the game seemed to have no problem forcing me to save the game every 3 minutes, meaning any choice you do make, you can just quit and restart and make a different choice, making the game completely pointless to begin with because it saps any sense of adventure you have.  The characters are extremely one dimensional and extremely unimaginative, they have less personality than a satsuma, and their unchanging expressions are ridiculous to look at. This lack of variation completely destroys any sense of immersion and any sense of connectivity to the characters you may have built up, which you would be lucky to.   The story is somewhat interesting, i mean, it has a lot of mileage it was just executed extremely poorly. The dialogue seemed like it was cut and pastes from a particularly boring roleplay two people had on skype, and it was just full of complete ramble. So much ramble, literally nothing of importance is said within the first thirty to fourty walls of text you have to sledge your way through, by which point the game has already lost my interest and my tension headache is slowly caning its way back into my brain.  The soundtrack is mediocre at best, there is nothing memorable about it so i have nothing to say about it... it's just... yeah, it's music... nothing great.  The game, well, 'interactive text wall' as i'll now personally dub it, has a shred of a chance of being somewhat interesting if the developer just manages to do more with the future chapters, if the future chapters are anything like this first one, it'll be worth burying. How this game has mostly positive reviews is beyond me. The point of a game is the content which you play, not how it looks aesthetically. Obviously it pleases me that there is a game out there for furries, but the content is simply not up to scratch to be worth anything near to a thumbs up.   You have a good idea and a good ground to do something decent, how many people really want to see boring art, boring dialogue and hear repetitive mediocre music? Nobody, that's how many.",

The Characters seem boring and there's no mid-scene pause button like in similar games such as Hatoful Boyfriend.   Thou I am a fan of anthros, i must agree with some of the other reviewer, This fell flat where Dust: An Elysian Tale excelled. As well as the controll sceem is just bonkers. I don't remember seeing a in game menu button.  In my opinion, Do not bother with this game unless all you can play is Visual noval/dating sims.",

            "review_text": "(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) Firstly, was never interested in this game. I've refunded it a while ago, and only bought it just because I wanted to do a playthrough of it on youtube to see if it was as bad as everyone was claiming it to be. They were not wrong, and even unfortunately it wasn't even that bad to the point it was humorous, it was just overall not fun to play, and frankly I didn't even finish the game, so this isn't a full, but only partial review of my experience with the game. The characters were boring, and uninteresting. Kila was an average over-worried, clutz. Rook was just pretty much there to help you progress further into the 'rich' plot. Jade was the cliche, cringey, humorless person trying to get better at humor, and Inumi is your painfully average shy donut steel oc from furaffinity. Oh, and you can easily find the mysterious 'man's' name by going through the game files. Speaking of the game files, it's painful to see that there's literally only two pictures pratically for each character in the game, one standing on the left, then flipping the image to make them appear standing on the right. Only for one character I saw there was a picture for a emotion they would give off in the dialogue (that's if it even shows), and I felt like if the game made the characters have more than one facial expression, it would make the game THAT less boring to look at. I've heard it's because the patreon for this game hadn't reached that milestone, which I think is silly, because I felt like there could've been different facial expressions if the artist's goal wasn't to make sure to shade the everlasting heck out of each of the characters to make them look realistic and such. Personally, I would've taken facial expressions over the quality of the art anyday.   Going back to the dialogue, there's too much of it, and if you're a fast reader, from what I've heard, you'll finish the game in under a hour, and you've just participated in what people are calling a Left Click Simulator. Along with there being so much, there's a lot of pointless dialogue that shouldn't even be in the game, like some of the dialogue tries to remind you of a joke if there was one, to go back and play the game with a whole different 2-3 choices, or just some pointless details about the enviorment and such. Speaking of the choices, for a game saying where your choices matter, it really doesn't feel like they do. Your first choice of the game is to tell Rook if you're going to be late or not when arriving. Really? This is a choice that will drastically change the game? I mean I heard of the butterfly effect, but I mean come on. Not to mention, the game stresses out that if Rook does find out or if you told him if you're gonna be late, he'll go absolutely go crazy and slit his wrists or something. The second choice is telling Kila that you're part of a contest or not, and then if you want to go to a Maid Cafe with him. Then the third choice I don't even know exists, because I gave up on the game before then because after those first two choices. There's such a large gap between that last choice to the next one if there even is a next one before Chapter 2! So get ready to read A LOT of stuff before you're allowed to experiene some type of 'gameplay' again. And the writing? Like I said before, not interesting, and nothing to write home about. You can find fanfictions that are worth more of your time than dealing with a game you spent 10$ on.  Finally, the price tag, and the game. 10$? 10$ for a game you pratically read for an hour, then it just stops, and you have to wait another month before the next chapter comes out? That's a joke. There are full fledged books out there for 10$ that can keep me more entertained and worth my money. This game in its current state, should not be priced for 10$, hell even on the sale, it wasn't even worth 7$ in my opinion. With the game's current content, playability, and 'gameplay' it should only be 5$, once again, in my opinion. Now if the game had more chapters and content, then it would be worth 10$, if there was another 2-3 chapters right off the bat, but since this game is going to be episodic that ain't happening. If the game is episodic and/or lacking content, shouldn't it still be in early access instead of you know, out of it right now? I mean, according to the patch notes, the game isn't even at version 1.0 yet! If this game was still in early access, the price tag and everything would make much more sense, but since it's out of early access, well there's nothing much to say or do. This game should've still been in early access, or released with more content, but since there is no other content currently, and it's out of early access, this a game you should not buy until a third or fourth chapter comes out, and you're ready to endure on a whole bunch of reading and characters that will possibly not even interest you. Funny thing about the game's lack of content is that if you finish the first chapter, don't like it, and didn't have it in your library for more than two weeks, then you can easily refund the game.  Overall, this game should not be bought until more content is brought in, and even then, do not have high expectations of the game's writing or characters, or it being worthwhile because more content does not automatically mean a better game. The writing is nothing to write home about, there's little choices to be made, the characters are uninteresting and only have one facial expression and if they're standing on the left or right, and prepare to hit that left mouse click or space bar A LOT. It's also saddening to know the majority of the target audience this game was supposed to appeal to doesn't even like this game either. If this game is still in the positive ratings, don't fall for it, it would be understandable if it was in mixed, but the only reason I feel that it's even in the positive ratings is because of furries. You can make anything as bad as you want, but if you have furries in the mix, then you better believe furries are going to support the everlasting hell out of it. It's 'pawful' I know.  yiff/10 needs more game  UPDATE 1/18/2016 - News has been told that the game will be getting multiple expressions for the characters of the game, as well as maybe even a talking animation. Despite this may not even be close to saving the game from the other problems it has right now, it's a much needed feature and it will make the game much more pleasing to look at, and nowhere as near boring.  UPDATE 4/14/16 - Still no multiple expressions, still no talking animation and the writing was lazily overwritten in the first chapter, though at least there was new stuff which didn't make it god awful to go through again and I found out what the hell is going on in the game. Though the writing is still meh, and everything still is meh. Nothing much has changed and even with revamped writing in the first chapter, I can only feel that even adding multiple expressions and such will not even make this game better. There are good visual novels out there, even interactive ones with choices, this is not one of them.",

            "review_text": "Now that I can post a negative review without it being flagged, let me explain why you should NEVER purchase this game. As a disclaimer, I don't care that it's a game about furries. I can enjoy any game as long as it has good content. I don't care that it's a visual novel, because frankly there are visual novels that I have enjoyed.  No, what makes me absolutely hate this game is the fact that it is a game without GAMEPLAY. The most interesting and 'fun' thing you get to do is make a name for your character. Other than that, the spam the Enter key for an hour and a half, and then you're finished. The game is over. Granted, that's just the released content, and the developer has said that there'll be more, but you're paying $10 for an hour and a half of pressing one button.  Every character is a blank slate with only one facial animation. The wall of text that assaults you throughout the game is boring, uninteresting, rambles on to the point where it completely changes subjects, and is very poorly written. Almost all of the backgrounds were, no joke, taken from other websites. I will add that they were acquired legally, but is it really THAT difficult to make an environment yourself? Apparently, it is. Not to mention, there was an attempt at stealing character artwork from someone, but that artist was understandably unhappy to have that happen, and was able to have it taken out of the game.  This is my third time reviewing the game on Steam. Why? Because I initially posted a negative review, and it was immediately flagged. In fact, almost every negative review was flagged by the developer, an egotystical maniac that just so happens to be a character in the game. Not only that, the entire game revolves around him. This forced me to make an ironically good review in replacement, and make a video review where I could voice my displeasure with the game without being taken down. I won't get into the fiasco I had with the developer, Klace, which resulted in me making several Youtube videos on the subject that spread across the community and at least positively influenced the removal of flagged reviews, but the developer puts the bare minimum amount of effort into the game. Calling Major\\Minor a 'game' is frankly an insult to other games. Dare I say it, Ride to Hell: Retribution had better writing, graphics, music, and gameplay than this. At least Ride to Hell was enjoyable for about 15 minutes before you were ready to bash your head against a brick wall. Major\\Minor has absolutely no replay value. The few choices (and I mean literally, a few) in the game are arbitrary and don't affect anything no matter what choice you make. The most influential decision you make in the game is the naming of your character, wherein other characters will call you by that name. Otherwise, spamming the enter key to read text (of which contains a good deal of grammatical and spelling errors) isn't what I'd consider fun.  Do not purchase this game. Don't do it on sale, don't do it at full price, just DON'T DO IT. Don't fund this developer. Don't let his little scam get the better of you. This isn't a good game. The writing is awful, the 'gameplay' is horrendous, the music is mind-numbingly awful, the art (both original and taken from the internet) is uninspiring and dull, and the story is absolutely reprehensible. Major\\Minor, congratulations; you are officially the worst game ever made.",

I would really liked to have liked this game, as this is the only furry visual novel I have seen, and would really like to see this sort of thing in the future, but as long as it remains completely unplayable, I can't reccomend this, no matter how much of a furry fan you may be. Sadly, I just asked for, and got refund for this game, as it did not appear Klace was even going to address this issue in future updates or patches. Something was also mentioned about this being playable on TV. what the hey? I thought everything on steam was suppose to be either PC or Mac software, not virtual DVD crap for your TV. If I want that sort of thing, I'll buy the physical game DVD for TV, which is almost always a visual novel also.",

            "review_text": "Well After finally deciding to pull this game back up after some time. and i'll safely say that I don't regret it.  As much as i don't want people to think that i'm reccommending this game just for the simple fact of... oh i don't know... FURRIES LEL... this 'graphic novel' if you want to call it that, actually redeemed itself thanks to the added chaptures. Although i am keenly frustrated with the kinda obvious ending. and i don't mean by story wise. the story is pretty unique in of itself. i'm just not saying what it is for the sake of spoilers. it's the cliff hangers.....  the game is going for a furry graphic novel with branching paths, that much is clear. but due to the fairly recent controversies this game carries on it's shoulders, and the cons this game carries, I can safely say that if the developer just went with the simple route of turning his content into a book that anyone could own, he could of easily avoided all of this nonsense that's lead up to this point.   I understand that He was mainly going for an interactive story that can be told in a multitude of ways depending on what you, the player chooses to make. It sounds good on paper, but what he failed to realize is the little subtle details that Make graphic novels good. and that's just simple things like more expressions on the characters, or small animations attatched to the characters, you don't neccessarily NEED voice acting, but it certainly can help with the quality of the product.  being able to have more ART effort into the game WOULD OF BEEN NICE. little distractions like those can go a long way. seriously, the art is just mainly reused busts of the characters mentioned within the game. EVEN THE GOD DAMNED ACHIEVEMENTS ARE REUSED. If that's not lazy design i don't know what is. and i'll mention this one more time....  If the developer just went with the simple Idea of turning this graphic novel into a book that anyone could read, with an interesting front page and all that. he MORE THEN LIKELY wouldn't have all these people trying to sue him. Or having people making an effort to personally attack him.  with that said, I hope the developer see's his mistakes on this journey of his and does his best to make the right decisions to not only make his content better, but to also protect himself from legal issues. The story is interesting enough to stay entertained, but I wont say it's a FANTASTIC story. it's a fairly unique one, something worth reading to pass the time, but everyone has their own tastes in stories. But as much as I know, every story out there has already been told time and time again, cliche's and or cheesyness will always be there. But not once in my own opinion did i notice any cliche's and or cheesyness. just a whole lot of confusion and questions that are unanswered.  It's totally up to you if you want to play this game. but note that it's mainly the story that keeps it held up. ( sense thats the point of novels ) the art is alright, but it's seriously lacking.",

Being the severely picky gamer I am, it is very hard for me to find good games to keep me enticed long enough for me to set aside an extended period of time into playing. The visuals are stunning and the latest update has me gazing in wonder at the great art work. Shiva has done a great job fleshing out these characters with a unique look and style. Every fur on the screen is very visually appealing to look at without a single dislike.   The soundtrack at the starting menu is perfect for getting you psyched up to play the game. Every time it meets my ears, the sense of adventure intensifies (insert lame meme joke). As someone who avidly listens to music wherever he goes I can honestly say it is a breath of fresh air to hear something original and unique. Maybe release it on ITunes?   Another noticeable aspect is the writing good god I am in lov with writing style. It is funny, intense, saddening, and downright wonderful. You can really feel the emotions of the characters in this game to quite a profound point. Lots of them are very relatable such as Rook, the ferret obessed with order and his trusty tablet. He has a sharp tongue which often leads to him being misunderstood, However, deep down he is a gentle soul that just needs some love and attention.  There are tons of people out there that are like that. I know quite a few of them. Seeing that in this game gave it a new layer of depth for me. Something I can relate to in real life as well as the game puts an entirely differnet outlook on the experience. But, I digress.   Major/Minor is an outstanding entry in the fandom and for visual novels over all. My few gripes would probably be the occasional dialogue error or grammar screw up. That being said, recent patches have fixed those problems mostly.  My final rating for this game is a 10/10. If you are a furry, you will love this game. If you are a fan of visual novels, you will love this game. If you love games, you will love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.",

Firstly i am huge fan of visual novels, i have played quite a few and Major/Minor despite it's flaws has great potential. So i'll start with the most important thing to a visual novel aside from visual aspect, the story. For starter there is this aura of mystery that from one point is very cool until the point it makes you feel like its overcompensating for lack of character development. Some things are just being thrown around to fill in the blanks. Here it seems like writter/s attempted to make story more interesting by adding plot twists on every turn, just when you think you figured it out it turns around 180* degrees and makes you reconsider everything so far. It just seems very forced to me and while no story ever is perfect i would love to see more tact and smoother transitions. Because after first or second, for some, plot twist you start to expect it and it boggles down your choices making it seem like no matter what you pick you won't be comfortable with the choice for the current playtrough. Which brings me down to second flaw, the save and skip system. It's crude and leaves lot to be desired. For a visual novel ability to skip parts over converstations that you've already read multiple times while trying different choices is one of important factors and the sluggishness showed here is one big minus from me. Also the saves seem more like pre-designated checkpoints at irregular intervals, and no menu during the storytelling is seriously limiting. Especially since the 'feature' of the game, so called rollback essentially forces you to quit to main menu and load the previous checkpoint save. It needs a LOT of polish there and it seriously needs to implement ability to save game when you want at least from my perspective. It would give a lot more fexiblity to the gameplay along with improved skip feature. I could drone on and but this review when i look at it seems to be turning into unsatisfied moaning at some point and i hate that so i will just narrow it to pros and cons.  Pros:  - Story has great potential - The furry note is a refreshing one - Art is cute - Price is affordable in comparsion to some other titles  Cons: - Story tends to be forced, at some points lacks fluidity - Some game mechanics are completly lacking and one it does have can get frustrating at some point - Needs more options  In short this could be refreshing visual novel with great potential if few things are tweaked and more focus was added. Quality over quantity :)  At the end this is just my own personal opinion, some will disagree, some will partially or completly agree, some will put it on a pyre but i felt i said what needed to be said. I hope to see more of this Novel. Peace out :&gt;",

Althought the game is already long enough it just does not feel full enough...Also price needs a rise....10 euro for this is like recieving it for free  Storry 9/10 (too sad most of the time and sometimes unnecessary stuff) Audio 11/10(Very high quality music for that simple game...)

            "review_text": "After beating the 1st chapter when I had time I have a few complaints. It's not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, and can be enjoyable, but the game needs improvements. Disregarding the drama around the developer (I think most of it was over-blown having looked into it)  1) The UI sucks, why? Because it's non-existent. The game offers you a save point at random times. Pressing escape just advances the dialog. So if you want to quit, and save your progress, you're SOL. This is why It shows I've played for over 4hours while chapter 1 is an hour long at most, but that doesn't matter because....  2) Chapter 1 has 3 choices total. You really are paying $10, and hoping the content pays off in a year. None of your choices have any real impact on the story so far. Hell, those 22 characters? Yeah, you only meet 4 (kinda 5, but all he says is hi, and then disappears) of them in chapter 1. On the topic of characters.....  3) 22 characters, and 6 females. For a game that advertises going on dates Klace probably should have focused on more females (located on the Klace patreon page). But, again, the only female you can kinda talk to in Chapter 1 is Eclair. Jade has no dialog choices. Rook, and Kila are the 2 you interact with most. This also means the dating, and forging friendships? It's not in chapter 1. Again, you're really hoping future content makes the $10 worth it because.....  4) Most advertised content doesn’t exist yet. Chapter 1 is what we would have called a 'demo' in the 90's. A lot like how Duke Nukem 3D released it's chapter 1 as freeware. It gives you a taste of what the developer wants to do, but it doesn't have all the features.   'Length of several novels'- Maybe when it's done, but chapter 1 was a pamphlet. A good pamphlet, but it's still a pamphlet.  '22 characters'- Not yet. 5 total, and 1 has no dialog.  'Go on dates, and forge friendships'- 3 choices, and 1 of them is if you should comfort someone having a breakdown. If your date starts with someone crying then you've done something wrong. The other 2 are 1)if you violate a NDA, and 2) if you go to a maid cafe. Riveting. My chair is useless because I'm on the edge of my seat.  'SMS send and receive messages'- You send 1, and it's pre-typed 2 choices. Meaning it's a regular dialog choice with an iphone.  'Multiple endings, and many choices'- 3 in chapter 1. The game did tell me I didn't get any 'true ending flags'. What are these? Are you really telling me there's a cannon ending for a choose your own adventure story? If you're selling the game on multiple choices then you probably shouldn't have a 'true ending'. That's just telling the player they made this choice, but they're wrong.  'Trading cards'- They're there.  'Controller support'- WHY? it's a visual novel that doesn't use anything but the RMB. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe future chapters will need a controller.  5) Main character is too introspective, and too relaxed. A lot more of his attitude, dialog and motivations should be left to the player. This is a game about choices, right?  6) Art is good, but there isn’t enough of it. This means scenes make little visual sense. For example 'SPOILER WARNING, kinda', if you choose to comfort Eclair she has the same picture as she does when you first met. This makes no sense since you found her crying at her desk. Why is she still holding a tray, salt shaker (I guess), and has a huge smile? I don't require full animation, but the picture should match the context of the scene. This also means every time Kila gets scared he still has an upbeat smile. And lastly on the topic of of scenes, visuals, and dialog.....  7) No voice acting at all. It's 100% silent, and has sound effects from the SNES. The furry community is fairly large, could the developer really not find volunteers? Even free Skyrim mods have voice acting now. As far as sound effects, scroll down and look at the system recommendations. See where is says 'Sound Card: Whatever makes bleeps and bloops'? That's NO JOKE. It does however bring back fond memories of Playing Mega Man X on the SNES. So free points for nostalgia.     In summary- It's not worth $10 as it sits. Many visual novels are cheaper, longer, have more art, and more sound. However I recommend Major/Minor because what's there isn't bad, and I want to see where it's going. Nothing is really offensive, it just has areas that could be great, but stop at basic. If any of my complaints have already been addressed then please disregard them. These are just my opinions based on playing the game. I haven't studied the game, nor have I paid for a patreon membership to get developer updates (how silly. Dev updates require $5 a month). As a furry I'd love to see this game succeed since most of the furry community is perfectly fine sitting in their deviant art comfort zone. It's good to see someone in the community with some drive to do more. Even if this game fails I hope it encourages more in the community to give game development a shot. As far as this game goes, it has potential, but potential is worthless if no one puts in the hard work.",

            "review_text": "It's alright, for the most-part. Simplistic RPG Maker visual novel, gameplay comes in the form of the occasional choice you have to make. Story is obviously not going to be for everyone, though you can get the gist of the setting and type of character you play as by looking at the screenshots and reading the descriptions on this page; so for the love of God, don't be surprised if you find the narrative yucky after making a purchase. Chapters are being released in an episodic manner over the course of a year, truthfully, I don't like this, or at the very least am wary of this. Yet, the first chapter seems to have plenty of content to it, as I've already put an hour and a half into it with no real hint at the ending being close; and let's say it's only going to take me two hours to finish it, if two hours is the average length of each chapter, that's a total of 24 hours of content for ten dollars.  All in all, I suggest that you do your research on this one, maybe wait until a few more chapters are released. That said, I'm certainly not upset to own this game.  Also as a side note, as far as all the controversy goes in regards to the game's designer... I don't really know ♥♥♥♥ about that, nor do I care. Worst case scenario, If anything, is that I lost ten bucks on what seemed like a solid little game to ♥♥♥♥ around with, all becuase it got pulled off of here due to copyright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, or the developer commits suicide before finishing the final chapter due to being harrassed constantly; boo-hoo.",
