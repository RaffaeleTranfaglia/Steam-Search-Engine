            "review_text": "Ys Origin is quite possibly my favorite game on Steam. It might be because I was already a big fan of the Ys series before I played it, but still! It's a great game.  Ys Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system. There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters. Each character has a very specific playstyle. To avoid spoilers, I'll only detail the initial two.  Hugo Fact is a ranged caster. He is very powerful, firing off spell bullets from his wand and his twin artifacts known as the 'Eyes of Fact' that hover at his side at all times. His is very agile, but he cannot fire while moving.   Yunica Tovah is a melee attacker. Armed with her handaxe (and later greatsword), she excels at close combat. She is very quick, dealing fast, hard damage to her opponents.   When you start the game, you get to choose from many different difficulty settings (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Nightmare), as well as choose which character you want to play as. Each character has their own storyline, though all three of them are intertwined. Playing each character is highly recommended, as each storyline offers more and more insight into the overall picture.  Gameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings. In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens. The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore. They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere. At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss. The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat.  Ys Origin includes a neat Arena Bonus Mode and a Boss Rush/Time Attack Mode. In Arena Mode, you choose a character and fight wave after wave of monster in a specific location. As you defeat enemies, you accrue SP. You can then use this SP to unlock a variety of things for this mode, such as extra costumes and even a surprise guest character! In Boss Rush Mode, you can choose to either battle one Boss at a time, or every boss in the game consecutively.  The music and sound effects are top-notch. The Ys series is known for their amazing soundtracks, and Origin is no exception. After awhile I found myself whistling along as the music played! You may be inclined to find and purchase the soundtrack online...just a warning! :P  Overall this is just an awesome game. I got it on sale for about $7, but in my opinion the original, full price is WELL worth it. You get a lot of game for the price.    Highly Recommended ",

Within a month I had played every Ys game on Steam. After a while I ended up playing every localized Ys game and eventually I even played the fan translated Ys V. This series is that good. This game is like a gateway drug, only instead of being a gateway drug to something worse, it's like upgrading from sex to wild orgies with beautiful women.   This game controls like a dream, looks gorgeous on high settings, and is just challenging enough to feel like a real accomplishment when you progress. If you love action RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play it. Just remember, you're getting yourself into a beautiful addiction that you won't be able to stop.",

            "review_text": "Most people, if you ask them to name a 25-year-old game series in which you explore dungeons and fight monsters, will likely say “The Legend of Zelda”. Even though the Ys series is as old as Zelda and has enjoyed immense popularity in Japan since the first game, Ys 1: Ancient Ys Vanished (1987), the series has never been that popular outside the Orient.  A few entries did make it west on PS2 and PSP, either through Konami in 2005 with Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim (the first English release of the series in thirteen years) or XSEED’s masterful handling of translations starting with Ys: The Oath in Felghana. XSEED released Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (1989), on Steam in March. This is the first time most PC gamers get to experience what is (in terms of number of game releases) the largest Eastern RPG series second only to Final Fantasy.   Released on Steam in May, Ys Origin is the seventh game in the Ys series and a prequel. It takes place first in terms of chronology, 700 years before the events of “Ancient Ys Vanished” (Ys I &amp; II). As you explore a huge vertical dungeon known as “Darm Tower”, the game elaborates on much of the series’ backstory, including characters, mystical artifacts and locations.   There are three playable characters (one is initially locked until you beat the game once with either of the other two), each has their own story and combat style. Yunica, a young knight, uses an axe and sword for close-range melee. Hugo Fact, genius magician and all-round ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, shoots bullets and is the easier of the two to play. We’re not going to spoil the third character for you.  Combat is fast and action-packed, with enemies having clear and recognizable patterns to their attacks. As you hack-and-slash your way up the tower, there are some mild puzzles to solve and mild platforming elements to jump through. There’s a kind of momentum system to keep you pushing forward: as you kill enemies without stopping, you gain a bonus to the rate at which you get experience points and “SP”. The “SP” points are spent to permanently buff your character, such as increasing resistance to negative effects like poison or confuse , or to upgrade your armour.  The boss fights are where the game (and series) really strut its stuff. While mowing through general enemies is pretty easy, boss fights require focus. You’ll need to learn their attack patterns, figure out which skills to use against them, and if you’re really into that kind of thing there are Time Attack and Boss Rush challenge modes.",

            "review_text": "Do you like ARPG, awesome story and don't mind anime style? Well, then this is what you have been searching for your whole life.  General Overview: As you start the game, you can select between playing Hugo and Yunica. Hugo is like an SMG, you can spam your basic attacks like crazy, but is slower than a slowpoke. And Yunica has oven mittens... oh, and an axe, and is quite mobile. After that you can choose your difficulty, whereas nightmare really is a nightmare, and easy for Hugo players (yes, I hate him and I can't play him). In this game, nightmare actually adds stuffs like attacks to the enemies, not just way more health and damage. Don't worry if you get stuck on a boss for 3+ hours in this mode. Upgrading your character is also possible. You get small crystals which are your ingame-coins. In Nightmare every crystal is 1 point worth. In every other difficulty, I think, the bigger crystals give way more points.  The story: The goddesses are nowwhere to be found on Ys. It's your job to go to the surface and find them. Of course, they are in the giant Darm Tower, the lair of the evil guys. Depending on which character you play, the story changes a bit. You get a few different bosses and other cutscenes. Due to this, you want to play it again, just to see how everything plays out for each character. Overall, to leave it mostly spoilerfree: Each story had it's emotional part and was well thought-out.  Gameplay: Hugo: Will make your hands hurt (You should map a key to autopress the shoot button 30x a second) Yunica: Solid Movement, good attack speed, fun to play and mittens. There are a lot of enemies. Some are just powered up versions of older enemies, others are completely new. Especially on Nightmare difficulty you have to be very carefully to choose how to deal with the enemy. Some are almost completely immun to your skills. Learing the patterns of your foes helps a great deal.  Setting: You play in a huge tower. However, this doesn't mean the interior is all the same. Every time after one of the bigger bosses, the tower changes completely. One time you play with lava, the other time you play with sand and also mirrors!  Unlockables: Yes, this game has unlockables. Once you complete the game with any character, you unlock something awesome and the boss rush mode. After you finish the game with every character, you get the arena mode and a shop. In the first you defeat enemies for points, which then can be exchanged for stuff in the latter one. The shop allows you to buy many things, like powered up spells, Hugo still sucks though.  Soundtrack: Just listen to the trailer music. It's so awesome! The rest is also pretty good.  Long story short: Buy it, so we get even more Ys on steam!",

            "review_text": "Some games I buy for the story. Some games I buy for the gameplay, Other games I guy for the music.  In the case Ys Origin I bought it for the gameplay and music However, that is not to say that the story of this game is it weakness. It have several stories to tell, although very similar are different enough to deserve a play through of every one of them. The music, as I said before, is an great reason to buy it since it is so well tuned to the game and gives you an certain nostalgia. The weakness of the game however is what all rpg can suffer from,  the difficulty can be a matter of levels, not skill.  This can result to you having to do some exp grinding However, thankfully Ys Origin gives you something for that trouble in the way of unlocking lore as you kill monsters. That said, the actual fights can be fun and gives you the ability to chose how you want to play the character  And finally you may as yourselves “Which game should I play first? Ys 1 or Ys Origin?” Since both the first game an Origin has spoiler for each others it can be a hard choice. However, I recommend playing Origin first since I enjoyed interacting with a certain character in Ys 1 more than I would otherwise had if I hadn't played Origin first.  And if you are only able to pick one of Ys games for now, make it Origin as it will probably give you a better lasting experience than the other games.",

You should still totally play it, because once all that stuff takes a break this game is an addictively fun simple brawler with a limited but very satisfying moveset, basic but enjoyable rpg systems and very challenging (depending on your level and difficulty), varied and interesting boss fights - all supported with a catchy soundtrack.  Don't expect Dark Souls though: if any encounter is too rough - likely because you're underleveled - it usually can be trivialized by grinding a room full of enemies for 15-30 minutes to get a handful of levels over the boss. There's also easier difficulties to pick if you don't feel like 'powerleveling'.  The regular playthrough is a very decent length already, and the game is designed for multiple playthroughs with different characters with different abilities and boss encounters, so if you enjoy the gameplay the game certainly delivers tons of it.",

            "review_text": "This game is what revived ARPGs for me. Fast paced combat, enough story to keep you mildly invested, and multiple characters to help fit more than one type of playstle. Ys Origin has many [noticible] flaws and successes, most of which make it the game it is today.  Pros:  3 Playable characters- We have your battle axe wielding berserker-style teenager, your snooty mage, and your 'Git gud and unlock me' Character. Each one plays differently because of movement, magic skills, or how well they can manage themselves in, what I like to call, 'crisis' situations (instances where you end up in a terrible spot and thinking/reacting fast is your only means of survival'. Jumping- FINALLY, A GAME WHERE I CAN PLAY AN RPG, FIGHT IN REAL TIME, AND JUMP!!!! Moving in 3 dimensions makes platforming puzzles and combat reach another level of challenging. Puzzles- Puzzles are NEVER stupidly difficult and one particular puzzle can actually be solved without getting a 'mandatory' upgrade nearby as 2 of the 3 characters. Puzzles are more meant to keep you from 'completely' blitzing through the game. Story- Story is spaced out enough that it will never wholely interrupt your climb through the tower, but will still be there to keep you interested Boss Fights- Probably the crowning achievement of Ys games, the boss fights will almost ALWAYS let you have a ton of fun on any difficulty (Yes, even people like me who are frustrated on higher difficulties still enjoy Nightmare mode/Inferno mode for Oath in Felghana). The fact that most of them keep the same pace, or even speed up a bit near the end of the fight, keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes victories that much sweeter. Difficulty select- You can't change once you start...but at the beginning there are multiple difficulties for the casual/hardcore masochist in all of us. Very Easy mode for the people who just want to beat the game, all the way up to Nightmare for the people who want to be challenged/punished for slightly better unlockable rewards. Music- FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING SACRED AND DEMONIC IN ALL WORLDS, THIS MUSIC IS AMAZING :L I am a SLAVE to the soundtracks in Ys games! Fanboying aside....we DO have many memorable tracks and a few that may put you to sleep (I'm looking at you 2nd sector &gt;.&lt;) but the tracks are all VERY good standalone....just not always for extended periods of time. The BGM will be the same for the ENTIRE time you are in a sector/until you enter a boss area, so get used to them.   Cons-  Combat playstyles- Each character can only really play one way...turning trash mob combat into tedium when you are a few levels shy of doing any real damage to enemies. Trash mobs WILL eventually turn into beat-em up sections if you need to go level grinding for any reason. Level to Damage scaling- You will get new armor and be able to upgrade your weapon as you play through the game but at the same time your level is just as dependant on your damage. If you are even 2 levels shy of where you 'should be' you will do little to no damage. You will literally get a small damage/defense spike around certain levels just so you keep up, a pattern present in Ys: Oath in Felghana as well. The same applies to having a weapon too low level. I was at the 3rd boss of the game as the 1st playable character and I noticed I could barely do 2 damage to the guy. Turns out, I missed an upgrade partway through the tower section I was in; because the MOMENT I got it the boss was taking normalized damage again. Upgrade (as a result) are NOT optional, which may kill the game for you if you are playing on Hard/Nightmare and you are going in blind.  Glitches- The game is relatively glitch-free from my 160-170 hours on record, but occasionally you will witness things like falling through a floor during an attack or clipping into things that stay relatively solid. Nothing too bad, but it did hurt a little getting to the true final boss and falling through the floor RIGHT as I pulled out my nuke move. Upgrades- Remember how I said upgrades 'should' be optional in places? This is where the game has the potential to be a real deal breaker for some. Most RPGs have proven that treasure chests are relatively optional unless something you NEED is in them. Ys: Origin loves planting things that make not getting OHKO'd/combat even remotely possible late game IN treasure chests and then giving you free reign to ignore them. This is not a complaint, but this HAS halted/slowed the progress of a few people Ive helped out on the forums. You should ALWAYS go for chests you see...even if it looks like a pain in the butt to get if you want to have a decent time above Easy mode.   Overall, I give this an 8/10, its EASILY one of my favorite games (especially out of my Steam Library) but even I can see where this game would ♥♥♥♥ someone off.",

The character sprites are well made and environments have clear and different themes and feels. The fast pace of the monster slaying is maybe a bit too often grinded into a halt when you have to sit through lengthy and uninteresting line exchanges between the monotone and cliche characters.  One interesting thing of note is the other main character of the game, Hugo. He should probably get an award for the most edgy video game protagonist ever. Most of the cringe material of the game comes from his teenage rebel attitude. The story might have been much less cringy had I picked Yunica for playable character, but I also think the edginess is kinda charming and memorable.

An interesting story, awesome gameplay, and very challenging. Well worth the money and made me purchase the other Ys games - which I am also enjoying.  You are given the choice of playing as a girl with a big axe or a guy with magic. After you beat the game you can go ahead and replay it with the other character or with a new, 3rd character. Playing it with the girl or guy you're first given feels generally the same, although you obviously have an entirely different set of skills. All three characters pretty much trek through the exact same dungeon layout but the 3rd character you unlock fights a set of new bosses and has an entirely different story. Playing on higher difficulties actually changes things besides HP and damage - although the story stays the same.  One downside is that I feel that the leveling was pretty tedius. You will find yourself in positions where you need to grind out 5 levels because it is literally impossible to beat a boss if you don't have the damage output. This only takes maybe 10-15 minutes before each boss but later in the game I remember having to spend an entire hour just beating up 1,000 grunts.  Defintely one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while.",

Yunica is a melee character; Hugo is a ranged character. Toal is a melee character, but his Boost mode turns him into a demon -- crucial for certain areas of the game.

In terms of story it stands strong, and playing between each character may cause the game to feel repeatable, but it's actually done well.

It's easy to get to the 100% clearing, but for 100% upgrades you really need to have a love for grinding.

You start out by selecting one of two characters each with their own unique abilities and you go to town on demons and monsters leveling up and unlocking new moves. The music is by far one of the most impressive features about this game too. One you warm up to the controls, you will really start having a blast!",

Upon the first few swings of my axe, I knew I was in for an amazing experience. This game's controls and combat system flow so fluently that every kill drew me further and further into the game. Even on Normal Difficulty this game showed the absolute perfect challenge... Hard as ♥♥♥♥. Only on one occassion did I ever beat a boss on the first attempt. Unlike most games where a death to a difficult boss would be frustrating; I never wanted to quit, as every death got me more pumped up than the last.  The smooth flow of the game wasn't everything. This games soundtrack took me by storm, as I am a sucker for a game's soundtrack. One amazing song after another... This game never grew dull even for a second. The fact that i have written over 20 words about this game should explain just how much I enjoyed it because I hate reading... and writing... and typing.....  Basically what I'm trying to say is this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, and now has a place in my list of favourite games. :D",

            "review_text": "The Ys (prounounced Ees) series has long ben one of the finer series in Japanese action RPGs. It has been known for being one of the first game series to emphasize story, its brutal bosses, fantastic rock soundtrack.....and barely ever being imported into the U.S. My own only experience with the series was Ys III, released in 1991, on the Sega Genesis  Ys Origins is a surprisingly polished game, considering its original release in 2006. With a focus on combat and dungeon exploration, the game feels familiar, but is polished enough to stay entertained enough through its campaign.  And what a campaign. Though a single character's story line is no longer than 8 to 9 hours, Ys Origins provides 3 different characters, each with a completely different fighting style, viewpoint in the story, and even differences in area accessability and boss battles. Combined with bonus time attack and boss rush modes, where devoted players can earn special costumes, battles, and even a bonus character, Ys Origin can easily be enjoyed for over 30 hours.   Ys Origin is not without flaws. The story is serviceable, but fairly predictable. Some later boss battles can be an exercise in frustration, and you'll wish that they mixed up the dungeons a bit more between characters. However, for anyone looking for a classic, rewarding, challenging action RPG with all of the Japanese trappings, you can do a lot worse than this artifact of the previous decade.",

I admit that some people may not have the paitence for it and the unskippable cutscenes may put some people off, but if you have the time to sit down and play through, My advice is put on some headphones, crank up the volume, and lose yourself in the awesome music and the simple yet generally fun combat of Ys. Even if you finish through one story and find yourself wanting for more, you still have two more characters and a lot of extra content to get through.  This game becomes incredibly cheap when on sale, i personally got it for less than £5 and it definitely felt worth over double that.  To summerise, If you have the time and like a good fast paced action RPG... GET THIS GAME",

The keyboard controls could have used a little more work (Namely a more reliable way to properly utilize the dash attack, A mouse is not a correct solution to this problem), Although it's not that difficult to get used to them once you've experimented for a while. Overall it's nothing overly complicated, And is basic enough to understand.  The main things I loved about this game wasn't the fact you can play as multiple characters, But rather that elements of the story will change based on who you've selected. The overall plot stays the same, However enough change is made to have one game tell three different stories.",

The same basic mechanics are on both sides, but the story is different.  Either way, it is a really fun game and has difficulty settings from the chill game player to the crazy gamer. It is on the upper escelon of action games that you probably didn't play.",

For those that don't know Ys (after the first game), it's an action RPG with 3D plateformer with a 3/4 top camera centered on the character.  In this game, you scale a tower with 2 different characters (and 1 to unlock).  While you can grind if you really want some specific things (like beating a boss that's supposed to act as a sort-of-unbeatable one), it's usually not necessary in normal difficulty.  Decent graphic style, good gameplay and nice soundtrack, if action rpg of old is your thing (think 2D zelda style combat), then you might really have a good time with this game.",

The fact that I am stuck with the resolution 800*600 makes matters even worse.  So if you play with a keyboard, like stories that takes ages to even let you play and like this retro style with mixed 2d and 3d modells, this might be the game for you. This is not the case for me so I am going to uninstall in about 2 seconds.",

Watch unskippable anime (or just minimize the game and do something fun) 2. Spam action button to skip tons of text (or read it if you haven't played any RPG video games in your life) 3. move your character for a few seconds 4. spam action button to skip text (or read it) 5. spam action button to defeat your enemies 6. spam action button to skip text 7. move your character and spam attack (which is the same as 'action') button 8. repeat  conclusion: It is very easy to like this game:   Solution #1 you need a few things: - love anime in general - remember original game  - have nostalgia  Solution #2 You haven't played any RPG games before, or played only jRPG games.  Solution #3 You just like easy-going pace of this ... well ... combination of non-interactive story and attack button simulator.",
