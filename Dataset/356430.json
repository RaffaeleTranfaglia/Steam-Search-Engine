A much-awaited return of a wonderful 'Sequel' To Transport Tycoon; now delivered to the Steam Community. This, without a doubt, is a personal favorite of mine, the sense of real-world management is within the gameplay.  [Including] -Multiple Variations of Nationalities, including transportation styles according to Era. -Real-World Management, including establishment of revenue and area of operations. -A challenging business: Disasters [Crashes], rivals, industries, and your decisions play a huge impact on the liabilites and credibility your company possesses. -The Ability to Create a Transportation Industry, 'nuff said. -Train Horns, I adore trains.  All In All, I reccomend this game to those who are accquainted with Chris Sawyer's works, including Roller-Coaster Tycoon, or to those who simply wish to run a company and feel challenged by the world around them. 10/10-PSCTD",

A lot of work went into this game, and it shows, despite the obvious graphical inferiority of it. The attention to detail and creativity is borderline amazing. For anyone who likes business management/tycoon-like games, this is definitely worth looking at.   Pros: -Different types of transportation -Scenario Editor, so you can create your own maps and landscapes -Watching as the business you bring to a town/city causes its rapid growth -Music is very unique -Precursor to OpenTTD -Old/Retro feel -Great De-stresser  Cons: -Graphics are pretty bad -layout can be annoying at times -Not really sure if multiplayer works, but I had to activate DirectPlay in order to even set myself as a host. It may be restricted to LAN, but I haven't tried playing a game because my friends aren't exactly keen on the whole management thing. If you need help activating DirectPlay on windows 8/10, feel free to add me. -Music can get repetetive -AI are super duper annoyingly good  All in all, I'd give this game a thumbs up. I haven't had any issues with it crashing, except for when I Alt+tab, so make sure that you save before tabbing out.",

I grew up playing transport tycoon (back when ms-dos was mainstream and win 3.1) then transport tycoon deluxe on win95, so when I saw this one on steam I had to buy it.   Definitely highly recommended to players who know the original tt/ttd series and new players alike.   To me the full price was worth it but if your not sure wait until it's on sale and grab it!   20/10 for me. ðŸ˜‰",

If you don't want to bother with OpenTTD, or running a dosbox for the original, than this is for you. Sometimes the colors can go crazy depending when you enter the options menu, but that is easily fixed by restarting (which takes no time at all).",

Maybe thats why I love it so much. But it is a bit more complex than RCT so you'd better learn how to play.   9/10 Too much awesomeness.",
