            "review_text": "tl;dr: Players who are looking for another Bookworm will likely be disappointed, as WW:TToB has more in common with Puzzle Quest than the usual 'create-a-word' games. Those players who are looking for an extra layer of strategy will find much to enjoy here.  From the very first level, it's clear that Word Wonders:The Tower of Babel started its life as a tablet/cell game. Once the expected tappable bonuses appeared on the main map screen, I very nearly shut it off, convinced it would be dull and slow. I'm glad I didn't, as it quickly becomes much more than expected.     What it is:   WW:TToB has a simple storyline that takes the player through 50 different battles, similar to Puzzle Quest. Just as in that game, energy can be collected and used to cast offensive and defensive spells. The difference here is that instead of matching gems, you'll be creating words on a board, building them off of the previous word(s) placed. Unlike most other word games, space is extremely limited, and only word(s) placed in the most recent turn remain on the board. You have a typical rack of 7 letter tiles; each tile has up to 4 lightning bolts (spell energy that works like mana) or skulls (does direct damage to your opponent) or a combination of both. Placing a word activates those elements. When it is your turn, you may activate as many spells as you have energy for (spells are used on a turn cooldown system). Likewise, enemies can also use spells (such as Paralyze, which removes half of your tiles for a few turns). There is, thankfully, no time limit for turns.  The game is made up of 5 tower 'floors,' each containing several boards. Starting with floor 2, branching paths appear, although you will still need to complete all boards on the floor before progressing to the next floor. Each board can change as the round progresses, adding letter modifiers or coins (collected by creating words over them). There also may be stone pillars in the way (breakable with a specific spell).   As the game progresses, components can be obtained to create unlockable potions, and letters on the man map can be collected to place in a 'Boost Board.' The Boost Board is a solitaire Scrabble-like game in and of itself: placing your collected tiles in the best way possible opens up additional points that increase your overall health and spell energy levels, and unlocks new spells. An in-game shop allows you to buy power-ups for your tiles and alterations for your board, as well as potion ingredients (if you don't feel like waiting for them to appear on the main map). All real-money purchases have been removed for this version.    Thoughts:   There are a few things that could have been better implemented. The game does seem to favor difficult racks; it's not uncommon to see racks such as QWZWSMX or OUOUJKX, particularly on Boss rounds. If exploits are your thing, you can end a round by simply casting a damage-causing spell instead of playing a word, and you can restart a level as many times as you'd like until you get the rack you want. US players should know that the game seems to use the UK Scrabble dictionary; thus words such as 'soho' are acceptable (a word that does not appear in the North American dictionary), but this really hasn't been a problem for me yet (3 floors in). A more surprising find is that there is no way to resize the screen; whether you choose Windowed or Fullscreen mode, the playing field is the same size. One final strange note: Once you reach level 7, an on-screen message informs you that Duel Mode (a local two-player battle mode) has been unlocked. As there does not seem to be any way to access it, I assume this is a holdover from the tablet version of the game.   Overall though, if those things don't bother you, this is a pretty fun, unusual word game, and the genre mashup works pretty well. If you're willing to get past the early hand-holding, there's a fair bit of fun to be had here. Recommended.",
