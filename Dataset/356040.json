            "review_text": "Simple and addictive, but also repetive if you play it 12 hours straight.  You play as a leader of a family of four and you control each member to scavenge, fight, or manage around you base. You can expand your community by recruiting new members and build a bigger shelter. You weapons will also advance from sticks and pipes, to crowbars and knives, and eventually gun. At some point your characters may die, and it may create emotional impact on you, but there is no time to mourn but harvest the body and put the meat in the fridge.  Also, enemies can raid your base, and this is the part where I really dislike the game. You can't arm your members with weapons when you get raided so the fights are quite one sided. You can arm traps that are built inside your base, but you can only start arming when the raid started. Aside from that, the shelter is already cramped with all the other items so traps are just gonna make the shelter even more disorangized. Also, there was no instructions on how to arm traps and I spent 10 mins watching my shelter get rekt wondering when I can't arm a shotgun trap when I have ammo (Turns out I need to craft a trip wire too in order to arm the trap).  It is still a good game though, ate 15 hours straight from me and I am likely to replay it again. This time rushing for police stations and getting all the guns so I can start murdering survivors.  Pros: -Simple gameplay, low complexity but high depth. -Customized characters that you grow attach to. -Crafting, with a large amount of items and materials to fiddle with -Low graphic entry. -Base building.  Cons: -Half-♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial, quite misleading at late game.  Overall: A total recommend from me. Though I do find it dull when you start rushing the speed up button to get your survivors finish scavenging, it does get fun when you add some narrative in there by doing some role playing.",

            "review_text": "Having only merely scratched the surface of this game in my 10+ hours of gameplay, I can safely say I'm liking what I've played so far, with still so much more to explore.  This isn't a game that hands you all you need on a silver platter right out the gates. You're going to have to really scavenge and prioritize and use time management properly. You start out with a tiny shelter with limited supplies, and it becomes apparent very quickly that you're going to need to remedy your water and food issue rather fast, and fuel as well, because if your generator goes down, everything living in your shelter soon will as well.  The game offers a basic tutorial at the start which is enough to familiarize yourself with the game and controls, after that, it's all up to you. You can allow new recruits to join, some will become loyal, others will take off and may sabotage your air or water filtration system (bad personal experience in-game lol). I always enjoy a well-made survival game, and this one is really up there for me for really offering what I need in a survival game, and that's an actual challenge with longevity.",

            "review_text": "This game has potential. I bought this game 1 year ago and since then the devs have been working on it and regularly adding new content. I remember the times when I had to open and close the door for each member of the shelter, where we did not have proper short-cuts, broken notifications etc. Its good to see we no longer have that type of annoyances for new players. I won't give detailed analysis of the game. The summary of the game is; scavenge, develop your shelter and survive. Its fun... FOR A WHILE.  The major issue of the game is once you get the basics it becomes very repetetive. The game 'still' does not have any re-playability. Once you learn how to prioritize what to craft, when and what to scavenge you won't have any difficulty dealing with the environment.  Everytime a major patch arrives, I start to a new game to see it will make me struggle and the answers is always a big Nope. Every 100 days later I have all my parts upgraded to max, tier 4-5 everything, enough food and water to keep 5-6 people alive for the next 100 days. This happens after each patch again and again.   I do not think the solution is making the game more difficult but rather expanding the possibilities.  I recommend buying this game when its on sale, however dont expect much replayability since the game is very limited in that sense.",

There's a few small bugs that can frustrate your experience like the mouse cursor disappearing when minimizing/maximizing or the camera shaing when adjusting the resolution as well as a few weird interactions that happen in the game. It's a fun game as it is and it manage to hold my attention for around 6 hours on my first playthrough of the game, but I believe that the game could overall be improved in all regards.

I kickstarted this game (in 2014?), and although not as good as I was hoping, Sheltered is a decent game for the price being asked. Admitadly in my 10 hours or so play I feel like Ive got my fill, and seen most of what the game has to offer. Once you get the hang of the games mechanics, its does feel like its get very easy, especially compared to slightly similiar concepts like Zafehouse Diaries. You send your team out, find supplies, ungrade your Shelter, and repeat.   If your looking for something that will be provide you with hours of replayability, I would perhaps give this a miss. If you want a fun 10-15 hour experience, Sheltereds not a bad way to spend your money.",

Macromanagers for instance leave free will on when playing THE SIMS whereas micromanagers turn it off or override it often. SHELTERED is a game for the micromanagers. I am not one of those.  While the premise and depth is great and I can tell the execution here is good, the biggest flaw I found was a lack of AI in the family members. They won't do any task unless commanded. Mom will happily stand outside dying of radiation poisoning while standing next to the damaged air filter with no hazmat suit on, and will make no effort at all to put on said rad suit and fix the filter unless specifically commanded. This is true of everyonr; you must issue commands to get people to do anything, and they won't grab a gas mask or rad suit unless you walk them through the steps of doing so each time they go outaide.

It's the same game chapter after chapter but the fun is deciding what to bring to each one and how much to build up of certain resources. The very first chapter is very good and that's the lure catchyou. The rest as I said are very much the same with only the added bonus of some intrigue from the NPCs you hire to help you. They do something you're not expecting if triggered. I think I have figured out the trigger because they haven't done it since I started doing this.   I recommend the game at $5.00 (that's what I got it for' but I would never have paid $19.99 or even $9.99 for it because I require more for my hard earned dollars. This doesn't give you that much only repetitiveness.  You can't go wrong with a $5.00 inventment in it though. Like or dislike it it's not a great loss of hard earned income. :))  The devs do want to know what you want though and try to put it in the game. Most have called for challenge and an electronic vacuum cleaner (me) lol. They are making a difficutly update whereby you get to pick how hard it is at the start. I asked for random, I hope they lisen. :))  One thing though most people know I'm a very harsh critic so if I recommend a game you can bet it's good and worth the amount I say it is. :))",

While raiders start attacking your base after you have built the skeleton of your base, the dull and almost annoying tasks of having to manage your base overwhelm any desire to keep playing to this stage.   I think in theory if the game's UI and management system made simple tasks a lot more streamlined (responding to distress signals, anyone?) the game would suddenly become a lot more enjoyable.

Fights completly lack strategy and are not fun at all. Some design decisions I could not understand at all, for example you can only get access to a special place in the game, when you have chosen the correct pet when starting the game, or let your pet die - move to another location and get lucky getting the right pet. However, when I heard what would have been the price for entering that place, I was relieved as there was only some loot you dont really need as the game is way to easy as it is.

            "review_text": "This game is amazing, but there are still a few game breaking bugs in version 1.4. If it were any other game, this would not be a problem. You could just reload from your last save and try again until the game doesn't encounter a bug. With Sheltered, there is no save function, so it's a deal breaker. (Note: if your family has a dog, do not try to send it out on an expedition before the dog has properly returned from the previous expedition. Doing this breaks the game, and you will permanently lose two family members through glitch.)  The second sin the game commits is making you design your family from scratch at the start of every session. So if you die, you must select your hair colour again. On the one hand, I see the point of this. By making the first five minutes of the game very tedious, you disincentivize people from restarting the game at every minor hiccup, making the hiccups in the game feel scarier and more threatening. However, designing the starter family is the most tedious part of the game. I don't mind building the shelter's first shower and toilet over and over and over and over every time I start a new game, but modelling the game family to look like my actual family every time has crossed the line from good-punishing to just annoying.  When the next game patch is released, I will probably rewrite this review to recommend this game. It has so much going for it, and an excellent way of spending a full day for good long session times. If you're the sort of gamer who only has half an hour to burn each day, maybe give this one a miss. Remembering where you were and what strategy you were going for gets tricky. It really was designed with the long session length in mind.  I'd love to tell you all the tricks I've learned to do well at the game, and game it by its own rules, but you're reading this because you want to know if you should buy it, not because you want strategy tips.  I will say, however, that most of the tips for winning are things that would probably work in real life also. There are a few 'WTF?' moments around the way water storage works for expeditions, but if that were handled more realistically, the game would be less fun.",

Another ridiculous aspect is you can't leave to look for water without water (not that I would ever find any water) all you can do is wait for it to rain and sometimes that just doesn't happen.  There is still potential though. Some of the progression seems compelling and the concept is interesting, it just doesn't work right now and I cannot reccommend it at all. This game will make you mad.  This game is not complete trash but it's worth a skip, from my experience it was just tedious and underiterated.

FUN of this game sadly i have to compare this game with THIS WAR OF MINE both game in the hideout, residents got lots of things to do and upgrade their base to meet different survival needs. but in this shelter, thanks to the ealry games 6 slots and lack of resources, all the left residents in the shelter could only do one thing that is FIXING !  i just cant figure out why the sleepbag requires a fix in every 3 days, like you got no 'lets sex 'option in this game, or is that morning boner something? shelter's expedition and war of mine's night scavenger, im just lazy to write it.  these is one more thing i have to mention, the upgrade system of manufacturing of the shelter items. lv1,2,3 every upgrade mostly provides enhanced furniture of previous upgrade which gave me less motive to build current level item because i know i could get a better one if i got upgraded. and boom, if you once reached lv4 all the new stuff comes, planter, ammo workshop, and the most important- rubbish eater the recycle plant. so all the most functional items in lv4, it really turns my game to, survive the early and mid game to collect the sustenance and resource to prepare the late game lv4.  a little bit boring to me. i got 80+day so far with 200 units warter.",
