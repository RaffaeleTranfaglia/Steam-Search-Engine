            "review_text": "I am going back and forth on this game. Honestly if it weren't for the art, it would be much easier to make up my mind. As it stands, I would give it 7/10, only because despite the art I genuinely enjoyed the game.  Pros: Lots of content would take a lot of time to play through and get all of the different endings. The main character is relatable, and all of the datable characters are likeable.  Story is fluffy and cute, believable well written dialogue for the most part. Buy all the clothes.  Make all the pancakes.   Cons: dat chin tho... Jokes aside, my biggest complaint with the game is the art. Although I will say after a few hours of playing my irritation with the art subsided to a degree, but thats not to say that it grew on me because even after a few hours of play I would find myself distracted by the seemingly disjointed chins of literally every single character in the game. If you don't think you can get past the art, don't bother with this game. Even the CG's are pretty wonky looking. Some might not like the stat raising aspect (though I personally don't mind it) The story lacks any real depth, (again, I didn't necessarily mind this myself. For what it is, I think this is just fine, though others might be disappointed with this.)  ",
