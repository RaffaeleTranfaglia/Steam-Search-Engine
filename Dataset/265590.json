If you played the Warcraft 3 Custom Map Night of the Dead ( NotD ) or the various versions of it in SC2, you will feel pleasantly reminded of them once playing this game. It is very much so inspired by them and the gameplay is similar, but also fleshed out and this game incorporates many new aspects, such as the leveling system, the various skills, and the ability to create your class before 'dropping' into a mission/map.  Teamplay is key in multiplayer, but you can enjoy the Solo-Mode as well and the game seems to adjust automatically to the amount of players, making it possible to play it with only a handful of friends or even just two player CO-OP.  If you like cooperative missions with great atmosphere ? Get this game ! 10/10",

            "review_text": "Ever since playing the indoor missions of the original Starcraft campaign I hoped for a standalone game focussing on this setting. And here it is.  TRS combines the looks and feel of Starcraft, blends in some DOTA-like micro control but has the players act cooperatively against waves of zombies and alien monsters a bit like Left For Dead. However, this blend of threats and mission makes you realize quickly that you need to know your way around before succeeding. By the setting and enemy waves alone, the game is substantially more difficult to master than many of today's games. The difficulty adds to the addictive character of the game - lots of replayability.  The developers continuously keep on improving the game and gameplay. Additionally, they are always open for your suggestions and eager to receive your crash reports. There is a close connection between game community and developers.  RTS is multiplayer focussed and purely cooperative so be on the lookout for a decent team / squad. At the moment the RTS community is rather small so at times it might be frustrating not to find enough players for your match. This is the only drawback I see and it might become resolved soon once there is a bigger community.",

I don't usually write reviews for games but this one is deserving of a positive review. It's kind of rough around the edges but it's still the most fun Ive had with coop in a looong time.   Word of warning though, the game is insanely hard and the multiplayer is a whole different ballgame to the singleplayer campaign and also where the game shines the brightest. Unfortunately there are not very many people playing the game online and this is also it's biggest drawback. Sometimes it takes a while to find a decent game lobby and for it to fill up with people, but thats a good time to ask questions of the more experienced players and to think about builds of which there seem be quite a few combinations.   8/10",

This game is an upgrade for those who played the NotD series (NotD, NotD:AM and NotD:SO) during the Warcraft 3 golden days. It is just as punishing and challenging, and being able to kill off your teammates if you are not careful. However, this game definitely rewards well to those who complete those challenges. In multiplayer, you definitely need alot of communication among your team (they have a Teamspeak server at  join.ts4gamer.com  for that), and alot of teamwork. Sharing the upgrades to the respective classes and the weapons each people are using, as well as sharing your items is a key for your survival.  The game definitely requires experience to learn and to push to the higher difficulties, so joining the Teamspeak server is probably the best advice for the newer players, as the veterans usually explain and advice there.",

            "review_text": "So being that I was a fan of Alien Swarm, I decided to pick this game up. So far I have been very pleasantly surprised about every aspect of the game.  Graphics-wise it isn't the best, but it doesn't look so bad that it is unplayable. It isn't anything like modded Skyrim, but it has it's charms. There is in-game physics, though it doesn't affect gameplay. If your marine walks across something that should be 'kickable' it will move. Kind of impressive in my own opinion.  Gameplay is where this game shines. It seems fairly straightforward at first, but I think it combines the best micro of a MOBA with the frantic pace of Left 4 Dead. There are times at the end of a game where you are running away in a panic as you are being pursued by far too many enemies to fight, but if you are smart and quick you may be able to pull off a victory. In addition the customization offered in character selection is surprisingly in depth. There are 8 distinct classes, plenty of weapons, different selectable abilities for each class, and small modifiers that make feeling your own particular play style out a necessity. Guides may offer a helpful nudge towards success, but ultimately you can play pretty much any way you want and still be successful, as long as you work well with your team.  Finally the community. There aren't that many people online as of right now (July 14, 2015). One would think this might create a barrier to playing, but everyone seems super friendly and helpful. There are games starting up every 30 seconds or so, and while you may not have that many to choose from right now you shouldn't have any problems with a pickup game. In addition the dev team is very active with the community. My second night playing multiplayer I saw a game titled 'dev game' or something like that. I hopped in not expecting much, but the damn main developer of the game was the host. He was consistently asking players if they were having any problems with a recent patch, and seemed to really care about making a game that was good, not just a game that will make a profit.  All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone on Steam. Not just because it is fun, but because the people involved with it actually give a damn about making games. If you care about the PC gaming industry, this is the type of game you need to support.  9.9/10 There is always room for improvement.",

You get some pretty interesting 'Weapons and class's to choose from'And the skills seem to have a designed sense of purpose not like alot of other games where you mash the keyboard when hell breaks lose and somehow you survive.  This game isnt that game you need to choose your kit wisely, and you also need to get familiar with the levels, tactics and your class what limitations are in place for each class and weapon to have a successful outcome.  The game is has a learning curve, but once you pick up the basics it keeps you locked in for a many hours. You do however want to be aware that since this game doesn't seem to have a huge following yet it is recommended you have friends play with you or buy the game as to be honest you can spend a bit of time waiting for matches.  But if you're like me and you have some note worthy friends who enjoy dying often then yes this game is for you.  Is it worth 20$ i'd have to yes they update often and they developers stay true to the concept and are constantly balancing and tweaking various game mechanics to keep the game fun. Also they have some pretty interesting holiday events like SANTACLAWS?.",

Don't be discouraged if the game seems overwhelming at first because there is a lot to learn and unlock but since it is a strategy game I don't think anyone would want less than that.

            "review_text": "Red Solstice is a game that encourages grinding and memorization of map objectives (and it does this even over teamwork) in order to succeed.  Typical games result in 1k - 2k experience for your selected class, and it takes about 10-20k experience to gain one rank in the suit (1% speed, critical rating, that sort of thing). Considering the number of classes there are and there are like 10 ranks in each suit, that is a lot of grinding.  Victory leads to 5k - 6k experience but if you're a new player that will come to you few and far between. And being that each game typically consumes 40 minutes or more, it will still take a considerable amount of time to max out the suit of your preference.  Red Solstice CAN be fun, but the combat tends to be a little bit less entertaining than I was hoping for. I play with auto-targeting for the most part and that actually takes a lot of the fun out of the genre, but necessary, because manual targeting isn't effective enough to take out the swarming armies the AI decides to throw at you.  Game has a tiny community, average at best. Multiiplayer games can take some time to fill (for a newish game).  Art can be hit or miss (portraits). No major complaints, but there isn't enough emphasis on the 'cool' element of manning state-of-the-art space marine body armor running around gunning or torching down alien zombies. I don't 'feel' it. Far fetched hope that this will be fixed. ",

Not only that, but this felt like a reiteration of the game on a different engine, standalone, with a singleplayer campaign and a few nifty things added. There is the vision concept where its harder to shoot in the dark which is neat. The manual aiming was also neat with the bonus damage it gave, but was a little iffy in that you had to aim a little bit more up to compensate for the slightly angled top-down view.  Sadly, these things aren't enough to distinguish itself as a separate game, and in all honesty, I would rather refund this game and play the Starcraft 2 version where the character movements aren't as stiff.",
