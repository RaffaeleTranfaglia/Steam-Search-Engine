Only problem is not enough english players, but the Russians that do play can speak english if you start talking to them. Really fast turns, and fast games. Big maps and small maps. I really can't think of anything negitve of this sweet F2P game. If you think you are awesome at Fallout Tactics and can take others on in the same style of gameplay, come get some!!!",

            "review_text": "Hmm... okay... I'll recommend it... but take it with a grain of salt, this game could be better.  I don't have too many hours on record but I did enjoy the time I put into it. After the first 3-4 matches... I finally figured out that I could win nearly every match simply by outmaneuvering the enemy team and taking their flag with one soldier and bumrushing middle with my other. Most players are willing to waste action points to shoot at you while I'm using them to push in further to their territory. Most matches I never fired a single round. Which is sad... I have yet to truly enjoy a match where my positioning made a huge difference and that we were able to annihalate the other team.   Pros: -Free game.... it's not hurting you to not play it. -Actually quite tactical with some decent co-op potential -Great Concept and the soldiers look awesome -Russia -Smaller and Larger scale engagements -Command 1 - 4 soldiers at a time in cooperation with your fellow teamates -I've played freemium games that annoy the snot out of you to buy their premium content,,, and I feel like this one is leaving me alone to make that choice myself instead of shoving it in my face.  Cons: - You can definitely pay to win... Some may argue you can aquire that premium currency for free by playing enough but that doesn't defeat the fact that I could pay them right now and have some gear to give me a MAJOR edge from the get-go. Things like weapons, armor, enhanced healing, vision, sprint distance that can make/break a victory or defeat. - Unless I'm wrong... there's only CTF mode... turns into multiple flags later but still no fight to the death mode that I have found yet. - Matches are too quick due to the CTF mode. Every turn gains points and after one team holds the majority, the points multiply insanely quick. Making the priority to push the other player off the point and forego any other possible tactic... Simply shooting a person off a point rarely works unless you've beat them down some prior to their assault - Feels a bit grindy... and not enough incentive to keep doing so. - I could play this on my phone, and be happier with it.   The game honestly just makes me want to buy XCOM 2 for a turn based tactical strategy. ",

            "review_text": "The game seems to be in development, but it's off to a great start. Earlier reviews mention english as issue, but it has mostly been resolved. It's very similar to x-com if it had a continuous stealth feature. There are mechs, granades, mines, missles, artillary, and bases to capture. The battle field is complex and a bigger gun doens't always mean you win. I've taken part in many battles watching my team get slaugther and so pulled my troops back and sent my spies into to claim their bases and win a victory even as they overwhelmed my main force.  The game is also gear intensive and that is actaully how your lvl is determiend so character you've been using forever can go out with the lowbies as long as he's using lowbie gear, so you can play with any of your friends who might be now to game.",

            "review_text": "If you like tactical turn-based games like X-COM multiplayer, look no further. This game is better in every way that matters.  Pro's: -NOT PAY TO WIN (everything can be bought with in-game currency) -Strategic turn-based gameplay allows for deep tactics and proper team co-op -Good graphics and well optimized (60 fps on highest settings on most PC's) -Frequent Updates and patches -Very active and friendly, mature community -Loads of content (weapons / items / armor / classes / maps etc...) -Clan Wars -Leaderboards with season awards -Daily / Weekly and special events -Easy to get into, challenging to master -eSport potential  Con's: -English localization could use a little work (Devs have acknowledged this and are actively working on a fix)  I've put in over 100 hours in the non-Steam client. Amazing game and community, game keeps getting better with every update.  9.75/10  Completely blows X-COM out of the water in multiplayer. Download now, the only thing you might regret is all the free time it will suck out of your schedule.",
