            "review_text": "I helped Kickstart this, based on my experiences with a demo released to the web a long while back. Unfortunately, while it is very pretty, and the surreal geometries make for an interesting play field, I can't recommend it on the strength of its gameplay.  There are basically thirty puzzles. Sixty, if you include the 'Nightmare' mode, which takes the original thirty and adds a second objective to each. There is a small variety of obstacles, some of which move (or adjust Bob the sleepwalker's path), some of which reset Bob's location or force the playfield to reset entirely. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult to solve. Most often, the difficulty comes from wrestling with the controls, or dealing with frustratingly fine timing in placing obstacles to manipulate Bob's path.  While the presentation is surreally pretty, its impact wears off quickly and the game never really becomes interesting beyond that. It's exhausted its suite of optical illusions and bizarre tricks by the time you're through the first set of puzzles, making the second annoying for dealing with the controls, for little reward. It really feels like they ran out of ideas after the first fifteen, and added the rest as padding.  ...which is disappointing, because those first fifteen puzzles are fun to play with. It's the rest that drags it down.",

            "review_text": "Back to Bed is a interesting puzzle game with an outstanding sense of artistic style. It is oozing with Dali influences (melting clocks, etc) and is easily the highlight of this game. I also felt some Twin Peaks influence, especially in the voice work.  The premise is simple. Bob is a sleepwalker and you have to prevent him from falling while he is somnambulatory using a little human/dog hybrid looking thing with the goal of each stage to get him...back to bed. It's very easy to get the gist of and the puzzles start getting more and more challenging as one would expect.  If you enjoy puzzlers and this art style, at its current price point (approx $5.09), I'd say its a worthwhile pickup. But its not something I can suggest you jump on immediately unless you fancy this sort of game and are in need of a new puzzler.   It's plain to see the developer put a lot of heart and soul into making this game and it's teeming with wonderful artistic references. Kudos.",

            "review_text": "Back to Bed is a simple puzzle game where you guide a sleepwalker back to his bed while avoiding waking him up or falling off the edge of the M.C. Escher-esque levels. I features strangely distorted voice work while you run around as a small creature, moving apples around to block the sleepwalker's path. Sufficed to say, it's weird.  Puzzles are pretty straightforward and thankfully allow the use of a fast forward function to speed up the rather slow moving sleepwalker. Some levels include moderately mind-bending parts utilizing the twisted dimensions of the Escher-esque style, though nowhere near as complex as The Bridge. It takes a bit of strategy and a bit of speed and reflexes to complete the levels, but nothing that's unreasonably difficult. I did find myself needing to make quick adjustments to complete a few levels which some people may not like.  The only disappointment with this game is its length. The game contains 30 levels and has a speedrun achievement to complete them all in less than 45 minutes. I completed it on my first try, though I tend to be pretty quick and made frequent use of the fast forward function. There is also an unlockable nightmare mode after you finish all the levels which requires you to maneuver the sleepwalker to pick up several keys before completing each level to add a bit more challenge. It never really gets difficult however, and I feel like the game was just getting started when it ended. I would like to see the game expanded, or a sequel with more and more difficult puzzles.  Other than the disappointing length, it's a very good game. Highly recommended for people who like puzzle games or just want a bit more weirdness in their life.",

It's not breathtakingly original, but it's very well made, and the presentation is top-notch. The difficulty curve is just right, with the game gradually introducing new mechanics as you progress through the levels, but without ever seeming too easy.  Excellent stuff. The only thing I'd like to see is a bit more variety in the scenarios, and it might be nice to have a bit more variety in the puzzles, but at this price, I can't really complain.",

This is a puzzle game with nice visuals. You control a little dude using your mouse (or keyboard, or gamepad; I only used the mouse) and grab apples and put apples on the floor. Sometimes you do the same with a fish. It is a simple concept.  Although it looks like a pure puzzle game, several levels requires fast actions to move the objects fast enough before Bob falls. This kind of fast actions detracts from the pure puzzle style and can be frustrating for some users. It is also insanely frustrating on touch-controls, but works fine on PC mouse controls (and probably also on gamepad controls).  Do I recommend this game on PC? Yes. Do I recommend this game on Android/iOS/touch-based devices? No.",
