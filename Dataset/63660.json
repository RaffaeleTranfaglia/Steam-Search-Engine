The puzzles are still quite tricky (probably moreso for today's generation of gamers) and the exploration aspect is just as we all remember it. It's probably not the most objectively engaging adventure game of all time but it's definitely worth the revisit for those who loved the original. Does it stand up against modern games of this genre? Well yes, because there are no modern games of this genre.",

This version as well as the other ones, of the main first Myst game, do not work. I can only play for 10 mins, trigger the puzzle in the lighthouse and this freezes my entire computer. Have to hard boot it. This is a new Asus ROG too, not a cheap computer, but steam.. I will NEVER buy another game. Your digital copy gets errors and you refuze to replace w a new program ?~!!?!?!

            "review_text": "Myst is a very story based puzzle game. The game starts off by landing you in the island of Myst, a small uninhabited island filled with puzzles to more small uninhabited islands. All that link together to find out why they are uninhabited. The game has loads of books that you can't read. The ones you can read give you an outline of what these island where like. They also give you clues to find more books with a single moving picture in them, these lead you to the island to help solve the mysteries of Myst. The story’s main beef in this game is between two brothers who are trapped in their own books with moving pictures. Each brother blames the other and they ask you to uncover there colour coded lost pages. The more you collect the pages the more they talk about the other brother and it does getting boring listing to them blab on when I could be reading all these books that either one or both of them have burnt. I would however have to say that this is a great game but I couldn’t imagine it for everyone. Especially when the puzzles in the game require you to make notes in the real world. But for a gamer who doesn’t mind that too much and like very hard and vague puzzle games then it is worth the time. Myst gets a solid 8/10 from me but if I would recommend a Myst game to a new fan I would suggest Myst 3 Exile. The only problem is that there is no current legal downloadable version so you would need to find a physical copy. It is also the same for Myst 4 but hopefully that will change in the future.",

            "review_text": "It may have been a decent revamp of the game at the time, but it's terrible now. It solves none of the vast compatibility problems you're faced with in getting the original game to work, and I was not able to discern any graphical improvements. (I had been under the impression that the graphical update was the entire purpose of this version of the game).  If you have an XP box sitting around somewhere, you might be able to get it to run on that. Anything newer and you'll face monumental problems in getting it to work. (Of particular note is the need for an ancient version of QuickTime that Steam failed to package with the game (it handles DirectX and .NET and uPlay, so it seems reasonable to expect) - I've heard both 6.5 and 4 referenced; I think I was able to get the original game running with 2 point something.  OldVersion.com  is where you'll want to be going to handle this part of the compatibility issues.)  It's a pity. The original game is quite the excellent puzzle game, and Masterpiece Edition really sounded like the most faithful remake option. (Free-roam exploration has its place. Uru and Myst 5 did an excellent job in demonstrating that place is NOT in Myst games.) And yet, despite that bias, I'd have to suggest anyone wanting to play the original Myst (who isn't an old hand at wrestling with major compatibility issues or a collector of old computers) should go for realMyst. Unlike the sequels (particularly Riven), the stuff you'll need to find isn't so much hidden as walled off by puzzle-barriers, so you won't have to worry about missing important factors in the background details because you have nothing indicating that a particular area is worth taking note of. (There's a couple things in Riven I'd never have found in free-roam - they show up because you're forced to look at it from a fixed perspective...kinda like that sidewalk art that looks entirely 3D if you stand in just the right spot.)",
