            "review_text": "This is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever played in my life.   Cons: No Voice acting No Dialog No instructions No map No plot  pros: It...works? Kind of?  The game drops you off in the middle of a mansion where you immediately die. fantastic. then you are sent to a forest where you are not told where to go and kind of wander around aimlessly until you find where to go. By the way, go fast because you are slowly dying. What is going on? How did you get there? Why are you at this house? Nothing is explained. there's really no music to speak of either and it's a giant glitchy mess. I spent 9 cents on this and I kind of want that 9 cents back. Dear god. I can't believe i wasted an hour of my life on this nonsense. Ugh. Save yourselves. It's not worth your time.",
