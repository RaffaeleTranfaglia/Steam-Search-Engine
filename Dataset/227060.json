            "review_text": "Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar is the game I've been waiting for. This game combines the grand strategy of Total War, but the base building and tacticality of classic RTS games.   Pros: 1) Decent graphics, which I actually think fit the game perfectly. 2) Easy unit control and building. 3) Massive sandbox mode has a map of all Gaul, which is amazing. 4) Genuinely challenging but fun strategy game, fit for newcomers and veterans.  Cons: 1) Some people might not like the graphics as much as I do. 2) Massive learning curve which can be fun and extremely rewarding to get through. 3) Some performance issues when zooming in quickly, but pass shortly. (might just be my PC) 4) The 'Combat Locking' feature is something I could do without. 5) As far as I know, there is no multiplayer whatsoever.  Overall, 8.5/10 Should buy if you're bored with current RTS games, and should definetly buy if this game is on sale.",

            "review_text": "I originally thought it would be a total war type game, just in real time. It isn't, but it's an enjoyable game on its own. The learning curve was not bad if you've played things like this before-  I read a review complaining about the complexity pre-purchase, and may I say, that player was wrong. There's a manual in steam for the game (I have not read it, didn't need to). Link cities to share supplies, like food and wood, keep your troops in supply zones until needed, build forts to create supply zones in necessary locations. You can check your spending budget and make cuts, but I have not found an overall happiness meter. Each city has its own morale you can boost with troops and such, if it bottoms out you could lose it to rebels.  Now that I'm done debunking that negitive review... the game is good. Not great, not worth full price, but pick it up on an xmas sale or black friday.",

As a fan of generally turn based strategy games, I am sceptical about playing RT however found HR to be just the right mix to not be quite a build a base spam as C&amp;C.   The campaign is extremely lengthy which is good and bad. I did find it slightly long winded at first wanting to get on to sand box and do my own thing, but I could of done that at any point anyway!  Could do with some more variety in unit types with possible building upgrades to attribute units such as in Total War. Would be also nice to be able to build forts and bridges in areas of user specific choosing and not saved map areas.  Great game, only issue I find is having enough time to play it!",

            "review_text": "Hegemony Rome is a spiritual successor of Hegemony Gold and as such has a lot of its features. The seamless map where strategic and tactical layers are fused together with smooth zooming that makes the gameplay quite enjoyable. In comparison to the old game its a lot easier to get income to support your troops since now you can build buildings and other city improvement where as before that was more dependent on the mines. Markets are essential for income. Walls are also a necessity. Forts nicely increase the supply radious so that you can expand faster then before and sustain your troops which is very authentic for roman times. Officer upgrades are also quite nice although maybe not as intuitive as one would expect.   Small tip for people who don't know how to get food/wood/gold supply going. Capture a farm/mine/logging camp with troops or workers (slaves can't capture buildings - you capture the farm by left clicking on worker/troops and right clicking on farm) and then send slaves or workers in the farm/mine/logging camp (right click on farm). Left click on farm/mine/logging camp after you captured it and right click on city and voila your supply line is set up. The same applies for city to city supply lines (left select city + right click on the city you wan't to connect to). Its as easy as possible.  The AI really depends on what kind of game you wan't to play and how you set it up in sandbox settings - don't just choose random. Playing as a roman faction (2 of them in sandbox) there is no certainty that you will win cause you have a legionary army. You have to flank the enemy and as such bring their morale down. Ah, morale one of the most important factors in this game. Watch out for food supplies when you attack or your troops will have low morale and break fast and then you will have problems getting more troops since your troops are dead and it takes time to get more recruited like in reality.   One important feature of the game that needs to be used a lot in later game is active pause so that you can move your armies and assault different enemy cities, forts, etc. Afterall this is an rts game.  People complaining about lack of diplomacy options - its the time of constant betrayal and warfare so its really not necessary to have sofisticated options especially since you sustain your economy yourself if you know what you are doing. Graphics - not really important to me as long the gameplay is good and I think that graphics that are in this game on a map of such grand scale (several times bigger then Rome 2 map) are quite good.   Does the game have issues? Yes, there are several instances where crashes or some glitches occur but they are not very common and game breaking (autosave is implemented). At this point I still recommend saving as many times as you can. I know the company for a long time and I know that if there are issues in the game they will be patched out and the game improved but only if people send them dump files that they can actually find the issues !!!  It took a long time for Hegemony Phillip of Macedon to become Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece and it had similar issues that Hegemony Rome has but were patched out at the end. Basically they are like Arcen games when it comes to improving and fixing their games.  What I like about this game are interesting, realistic formation battles, city improvements that make game more user friendly in comparison to Hegemony Gold and realistic morale and supply system in comparison to other games in RTS genre where you have your armies magically march through the whole map without any supplies and without any morale issues.  As famous idiom by Napoleon Bonaparte says: 'An army marches on its stomach.'  Just one more thing if you are expecting Rome Total War game from this - its not a Total War game so don't expect something like that or you will be dissapointed - its an RTS game of never before seen scale so it might be too much for a lot of players. I would still recommend the game at full price and over Rome 2 Total War at any time.",

It's definitely pretty buggy, loads of crashes, but it did recently come out of early release. The launcher itself doesn't always work, so you may have to launch using the Launch32 file in the Steam files.  Anyway back to the game. It's an amazing strategical game, and can prove a challenge for strategy veterans too. It's all about logistics and empire management, definitely something to keep you going for hours.. if it doesn't crash.   Note: Do NOT Alt+Tab or manually save the game. This can cause crashes. When starting up, change the game to autosave every 5 minutes.",

Game is very detailed, the animations still need some work, it's very lovely. Very much detail I'd say it's slightly better than Rome Total War II, still though. The animations man!

The Good-- - Some attention to historical detail. The towns and cities throughout Gaul come with a small snippet of history about them. - Complex supply and recruitment system. As you conquer more territories and resources, you must work them into your supply network in an efficient manner. - Sometimes challenging AI.  The Bad --  - Optimization is poor to non-existent. Even if you have a higher end machine that can run far more demanding games, odds are you will suffer from extreme lag.  - Very buggy and prone to crash. - Small selection of recruitable units. - Awkward and clunky unit command system. - No further fixes in sight. The developers have stated that they have moved on to other projects, so if you are waiting for patches and fixes, you may have to move on as well.",
