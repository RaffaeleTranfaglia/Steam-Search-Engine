            "review_text": " Indie Dev: The Melodrama , err  Indie Game*: The Movie  is a completely misleading title for an intricate human interest story documenting four developers in various stages of production (the so called overarching  'past, present and future'  theme).   It is an enjoyable experience which is a testament more to the circumstances of the subjects as well as the subjects themselves. Honestly, a documentary about a diabetic introvert, a morbidly hilarious husband, and an egoistical over-the-top guy seems not that hard to conceive. The vulnerability and candor managed to be captured on screen is very touching etc. and you connect with them on a real level... sure; which is sheer luck due to having such perfectly documentable(?) subjects with all their personal stories, histories and families conveniently accessible to the filmmakers.   If Real Estate is about  'Location, location, location'  I would say Journalism/making Documentaries is about  'Time, time, time'  and they manage to be at right place at the right time to capture these genuine, raw, emotionally charged moments (like the swimming underwater with Ray-bans on thing! rrrright?). I guess this is why they completely changed their focus from documenting 'the indie dev scene' to these specific ones. Works for me!  Factor in a 'Morgan Freeman'-esque John Blow to neatly wrap up with a few words of wisdom/caution, and the palpable tension of the respective situations giving you an emotional story which could do well on The Oprah Winfrey Network.  Something with little to no actual technical information for a budding developer or dilettante but a very interesting story nevertheless. The Team Meat commentary is incredibly funny (although extremely profane) and deserves a second playthrough, the Director's one not so much but I did end up watching it as well.  P.S. Microsoft is evil, confirmed.",

It is full of pain, sadness, loneliness... to make a remarkable game requiers pure soul and pure heart.  To be honest, I glamorized the process of making a game. I glamorized it to the very moment of my first game-make attempt. It was 2 months ago, and my 1st game is plain s*it - but it is my game and it is complete. Then I realized, that developing a game hurts like hell, but I thought 'Maybe there is something wrong in ME actually.' Why am I saing this ? Because this movie makes me realize, that I was wrong. That there was no mistake nor problem with me - developing a game, regardless of its final form, its trully painfull... After all, like all creation processes, where Art comes out.  I have to thank for enlightening me to those guys in this movie. Great games gurus - creators of FEZ, Super Meat Boy and Braid. One day I shall stand in front of you with my own, ultimate game (which I plan to build with my friends) and salute you. One day, I shall thank you in person for what you teached me with this movie.

So, you might not like indie games, or have a disbelief for indie developed products, but honestly this is a beautifully shot documentary, and once you start watching it might be hard to look away.  For me I had an extra connection to it because I have played almost every game they covered and liked most of them, 'meeting' the people behind the games is an awesome feeling and you might get a bigger respect/understanding, some people get disdain as well.

            "review_text": "Well, this is certainly new. I've never reviewed a film on Steam before. I feel like I should be going through my credentials:  Hi! I'm Double Uppercut. Along with having played nearly 300 video games in my life so far, I have also watched over 600 films...  This sounds too formal. Let's just review the movie.  Indie Game: The Movie follows the stories of three well-known indie games- Super Meat Boy, FEZ, and Braid- along with their developers and their personal stories tied into the making, release, and reactions to their games.  It's weird thinking this, but I only started using Steam more often about a year and a half ago, around the time I started reviewing games here too. And I never thought that in that span of time I'd be exposed to so many indie games. I love to rag on my least favorites, like Woodle Tree Adventures or Slaughtering Grounds or Manhunter... but I'm sure their developers put some amount of effort and time into making these games as best as they could.  Didn't stop them from sucking a** though.  I like a lot of Jonathon Blow's hindisight on the release of Braid. It really shows how your own mentality can be inserted to a game, and that polishing it too finely can make it lose that value of feeling genuine. It's one of the reasons why I personally love the thriving indie market here on Steam. I love to see what smaller teams and people can bring to the table that might even be better than the best that EA or Ubisoft can craft.  People out there have their reasons for hating Phil Fish. And I won't lie by saying that I laughed seeing him mock all of his 'haters' in a childish tone at the beginning of the movie. But I think this film does an excellent job of making him feel relatable. He's such a perfectionist and wants to capture peoples' attention so desperately, that he can't feel like FEZ is just going to be a good game when he releases it. He has to be absolutely sure that it is the best it can be.  Edmund and Tommy's parts are probably my favorite. I don't love Super Meat Boy as much as other people, but I enjoyed what time I spent playing it. I could see where some ideas of Ed's personality came in through the level design... but I didn't see it in the character design until he fully explained who Super Meat Boy is, and why Bandage Girl is so important to him. The game itself didn't explain it the way he did, but I think whenever I return to play Super Meat Boy again, his thoughts behind the game will stick with me the whole time.  Jim Guthrie is fantastic. I've yet to play Sword &amp; Sorcery, but if Indie Game: The Movie showcases at least an ounce of his musical talent, then I cannot wait to see what this game has to offer. It's quiet, somber, and exciting when the scenes that contain music need it to be.  The cinematography is also wonderful, despite some shaky impromptu moments. But the angles and positions of the camera all entail what each creator is thinking during the process of making their games, while also viewing them at their most vulnerable moments.  Despite a few cheesey moments, the film is incredibly solid. It add a new insight to indie games that I didn't recognize there was before. It's tight, heartfelt, intelligent, and most importantly of all... unique. I am more than happy to have Indie Game: The Movie in my library, and it is definitely going into my favorites. This is a fantastic film- 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Indie Game is a well-produced movie about the trials and tribulations of indie game development. It follows Phil Fish during the production of Fez and Team Meat during the production of Super Meat Boy and provides some very interesting insight into the development process and how it affects the lives of the developers. They also talk to Jonathan Blow about Braid and his design process which was quite interesting, though a much smaller part of the movie.  The section about Phil Fish really highlights how much he struggled to create Fez from the multiple redesigns of the game to the legal issue with his former partner and technical issues showing off the game to the public for the first time. It's a pretty strong contrast to the extremely negative publicity surrounding his treatment of PC players. It's hard not to feel some sympathy for him after watching the movie, but it doesn't make me like him any more.  I really enjoyed the parts of the movie about Team Meat, partially due to how much I enjoy their games, but also due to their explanation of the development and design process. Super Meat Boy is one of those games that despite being extremely difficult is rarely frustrating due to the superb design. In the movie, they explain the design process perfectly and it helps explain why Super Meat Boy is so fun, yet many other similarly difficult games are so frustrating. If you watch this movie for anything, watch it for that.  The special edition adds a number of bonus videos where various other indie developers are interviewed, many of whom I have never heard of (or their games for that matter.) Nevertheless it is a substantial addition to the movie that is worth watching.  To summarize, the movie is excellently produced and provides great insight into the indie game development and design process and I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who is a fan of Team Meat.",
