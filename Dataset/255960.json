I had a great time doing sound design and writing the music/score for this game and while it's been available on my website at  xorcist.com  for a while, it's now INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD OF THIS GAME! Some of you in the scene may even remember dancing to 'Bad Mojo' on the dance floor throughout the gothic and industrial scene.  The soundtrack is a double disc set and comes in FLAC as well as MP3 formats along with ALL ARTWORK for the disc, tray cards, etc. - It's hidden away in your game directory at &lt;drive&gt;:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/BadMojo/Bonus Content/Soundtrack (FLAC) and Soundtrack(MP3)  I hope you enjoy this little bonus and while I don't see anything from any sales of this game, the hopes is you check out my site and maybe check out my other music and soundtrack work.  Comments welcomed!  Bat / Xorcist",

            "review_text": "It's probably a great game. It certainly looks like it. Unfortunately, it doesn't run. Have a look at the discussion forums for this game and you'll see several threads of people trying to find a way to stop the game from crashing on load, and not succeeding. Nightdive and Steam have both refused to offer any support or assistance with this problem. It crashes intantly on loading: the only way I was able to get the 5 minutes of gameplay required to post a review was to leave the crash error window open for a while. If you're prepared to gamble with the possibility of the game not working, go ahead and give it a try. You may get lucky. But until some kind of patch is released to fix this common issue (and that doesn't seem likely to happen), I have to recommend saving your money for something that works.",
