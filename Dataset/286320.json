            "review_text": "An awesome old school-styled point &amp; click adventure game with a beautiful art and good soundtrack.  The story is inspired on Swedish folklore, you find yourself in a unknown place surrounded by strange creatures, and you have to discover the reason why you are in there and what is going on around by solving the puzzles.  The most interesting point on this game is the fact that you can change the environment, getting control of 'runes' that give you the ability to change the things around you.  Oknytt is pleasant slow paced game,and really a must play for the retro adventure gamers.",

            "review_text": "Playing Oknytt can be an enjoyable experience even when using a walkthrough guide right from the very start, as I did. Using such a guide might in fact be recommended, as it helped me avoid the frustration and the tediousness typical to this kind of point-and-click puzzle games. Since there were no more headaches caused by having to find certain items, discover specific combinations, and so on, I could fully focus on the enjoyable parts of the game: the art style, the stories, the exploration (and the discovery of new characters, stories, levels), etc.  I'd say the gameplay isn't exactly Oknytt's strong point, but only unless you're not a fan of solving point-and-click challenges, as some of the item combinations are quite intuitive (unlike other similar games) and it's also got some gameplay originality in the addition of some 'elemental runes'.   Anyway, I personally enjoyed everything else about this little game, not the gameplay.  Its main theme is truly original, as it's inspired from the Swedish folklore. And not just barely, remotely inspired, but deeply rooted and connected to Swedish folklore, from the very start to the very ending.  The main story isn't very intricate but the many secondary characters that the main protagonist encounters during its journey are all interesting and unique. The ending was rather abrupt and quite ambiguous for my taste, but not bad enough to cause me any real disappointment.  The visuals aren't sophisticated, but they're charming. In a very dark tone at all times, the game feels immersive and captivating. The voice acting and the sounds are also top-notch. Even if there's one single voice actor for all characters, that guy is clearly hugely talented and does a great job.   As for the game's length and value for money, considering its low full price, Oknytt gets another plus in my book.  Pros:  - strongly inspired from Swedish folklore, making it original and even a bit educational - nice visuals and art styles - top notch voice acting and sound effects - it's inexpensive, simple, lightweight, neat, and really enjoyable  Cons:  - gameplay based on typical point-and-click elements. Without a guide, it may take a lot more hours to complete, not to mention the unavoidable frustration coming along the way.",

I really love the rune stones that cause effects in the environment, I think that was a great addition to the game this is definitely one of the best point and click games I've played I'm so glad I bought it.",

            "review_text": "A beautiful tale set in the Swedish mythos, you become the guide for a 'small, in the scope of the world insignificant creature' who wanders about in the world on the longest, and darkest, night in many moons. On the journey, encounter and learn about other mythological creatures of Sweden, and explore the darkness as it comes to life in ways rarely seen. All of this, ultimately, is a campfire story, but a beautiful one at that. The puzzles in this game, while not always intuitive, have a certain logic to them that makes sense. With the elemental runes of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire affecting every scene differently, some really interesting puzzles and solutions develop, along with some cute visuals and the more traditional inventory interaction system. And, if you really like storytelling, every interactable piece has an option to hear more narration, as well as the character's speech or just interacting with it. I spent many hours contemplating what I experienced after finishing this game. It has a touching story and an art style I don't see often in games that I found quite pleasing, and the narrator does a great job at setting the tone. If you like point and click puzzle adventures and campfire stories about mythology, then definitely pick this game up. If you like any one of those qualities I mentioned, pick this up. It's a gem.",

Didn't like the voice acting, it made the game feel like i was watching something made for very small children. And broke what could of been a slighty eerie atmosphere, the main protaganist definitly should of been silent. Some puzzles felt obscure, some easy, some suprisingly clever. Worth a purchase at the low price if you like point and clicks.",

            "review_text": "Are you up for a tiny adventure?  Oknytt is a point and click adventure game that contains swedish folklore but also levels of harsh crypticness.  You control a 'small insignificant creature' that looks like a furball with glowing white eyes and a small trunk with ears. You interact with not only the enviroment and items but also have control of the four elements displayed as runes in the bottom. These have varying effects depending on the area and screen you are at and may be vital for making progress. Most interaction is done by clicking and holding the button, releasing it at the desired action: The hand to touch or pick up the target, the speech bubble to talk to it or the paper to have the Narrator talk about it in detail.  The story follows this small creature trying to help a small alva that has no wings. As things goes, they end up in various locations, and here is where the problem occurs: More than often will you be clicking everywhere and press the runes, trying to figure out how you are meant to progress. In most point and click games, it is often 'more obvious and hintful' with say highlights or strong hints in character speech.  But does that mean this game is bad? It makes it challenging. Although it may not be too fun being too much of a guessing game.  The visuals of this game is gloomy, but fitting for this setup. The alvas sure stand out with their glow and the white beady eyes most of the monsters have give you that 'staring' feeling.   The voice acting is satisfying to listen to; it is done quite nicely. The narrator sounds like someone wise yet someone you 'know'. Not some stranger telling you a tale. The small creature has an adorable personality, looking to make friends and help others as it wants to find its purpose and place in the world. Everything else from the hustomte and trolls and other folklorish monsters sound fitting.  It's worth the investment, despite it being a cryptic cluefest. A hidden legend of zelda reference is thrown in too.   But beware the ending.",

            "review_text": "'Oknytt'. It's a lovely, charming, and well-written story, inspired by Swedish folklore. You play as a small, insignificant creature, that meets many strange, magical and creepy beings during a very dark and special night. A warm narrator's voice will guide you through the complicated world of Swedish bestiary.   The small insignificant creature is very small and very insignificant indeed. It can't run, can't jump, can't fight, doesn't have claws or fangs, or amazing powers. But somehow, in the large scheme of things, the small insignificant creature turns out quite significant.  It's a short game, took me about 4 hours, I suppose you could do it within 3-5 hours, depending on how many times you get stuck. It's a typical point and click game, with a few puzzles, mostly quite logical and simple. Once in a while you have to use the classic 'use everything on everything' move, when the tips are unclear, but in general, using your brain will get you through it. The interesting thing is the 'elements' mechanic, where you can use an elemental power to see how it will affect your environment. You might summon an insect to sit on someone's head, rekindle a fireplace, or start rain. You never know until you try.  What is extremely outstanding is the artstyle. The story is very sweet, almost like a children's book, with a little innocent creature travelling an unknown world and helping others solve their problems. There's simple morals and a simple lesson to be learnt - even the most insignificant ones, can change a lot. The voice of the creature is just cute, and adorable.. like a children's story character's should be... And then you see the artstyle. It's dark. It's extremely dark, to the point of being malevolent. Most of the Swedish folklore creatures you meet look creepy, strange or even dangerous and scary. It's mostly black and white, with disturbing shiny eyes, and unsettling half-human faces. Each new room you explore is a whole new study on creepiness and hidden fears. It gave me chills a couple of times, and hypnotized me completely.  The sounds are very delicate, almost unnoticeable, but playing in with the dark, creepy artstyle perfectly.  As a whole it's a sweet children's story, with a terrifying almost horror-like environment. If you like sweet things, and creepy things alike - like I do, you will enjoy 'Oknytt' in all of its splendor.",

While it's riddles seem sometimes confusing and illogical, those who pay attention to dialogs, descriptions and backgrounds are able to solve them without any problems. I only wish the game mechanic with the 4 elemental runes would have been explained better as the tutorial consists only of four written pages. Also, the missing of an highlighter-button, while in style with the old school of point'n'clicks leave you sometimes scratching your head, only because you missed to notice another clickable area on the screen. Regardless, this is a short gaming experience i would recommend all those who like a good story. Voice-acting and graphic are also way over the quality you could possibly expect at Oknytts current price.",

            "review_text": "I have only played the first chapter so far, but my complaints lie with the mechanics, not the story, so I feel this review is still fair. I will update later if things change.  So far, I am not impressed. I play a lot of adventure games, and this one falls pretty low on my list. I like the story, and I will play through the whole game to see the story line completed, but it seems that in just about every aspect of this game the deveolpers took the easy way out.   The most obvious easy path they took is that there doesn't seem to be a single object interaction animation. Instead your character just stands there stupidly, the narator says what you did, and the newly altered object appears in your inventory. How lazy.  The game seems to have a single voice actor, which might add to the 'reading a story' aspect of the plot, but comes of as cheap and ruins my immersion. His voice is fine as the narrator, but when he tries to do other characters, it's always the same, cheesy falseto.  Most frustratingly, tasks were not logical and did not give enough prompting. 'I need tools' was the prompting for one task but despite having multiple things that pass for tools in my inventory, I made no progress. Finally through trial and error, I realised that he needed something else (no spoilers) not a tool at all!  In fact nearly half of the progress I made on this chapter was simple trial and error - just click every clickable point with every item from my inventory. No fun at all.   This was made worse by the fact that there is no 'reveal hot spot' button for when you get stuck, so I had to resort to a walkthrough at one point just to learn that there was a hot spot that I didn't know existed.  But I think the worse part, and the most lazy choice on the part of the developers is that if you use the wrong item with anything, you get the same exact message every time 'No that's not how it happened.' This tells you nothing about how to proceed. How about 'No I think I need something sharper for this job' or literally anything to point you in the right direction. So without that, when you get stuck, trial and error of every single item is your only option - expect no assistance.  So disappointing from a game with such a good storyline.",

            "review_text": "It's not without its problems, but this old-school point-and-click is a treat for anyone interested in Nordic mythology. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys these games on a more casual level. Best of all, there's no way to fail, so no matter how frustrated you get, you know that you'll never have to reload or start over.  The haunting melodies and art really pack quite a punch, the story is simple but captivating and a bit sad, the elder little creatures who populate the world all have their own selfish personalities, and the unique mechanic of being able to manipulate the elements in each room. Amazingly, everyone is voice acted by one dude, yet they're all easy to tell apart, and everything is narrated. The many item puzzles are certainly challenging, but contained in small areas, so thankfully no sprawling worlds to backtrack through; the few logic puzzles are fairly simple.  That said, some problems are pretty glaring. The dull color scheme and busy backgrounds really leads to difficulty finding usable objects, so most screens become a game of mouse hunting, while many puzzles (especially early on) make very little logical sense, and can often only be solved by trial and error. Later in the game, they start to make more sense, and the journal gives more hints, too. I only touched a walkthrough once or twice in the second half.  The voice actor was wonderful for the various characters, but so dull and overly slow for narration. I honestly would have enjoyed the voice acting more if the narration parts of conversations had been skipped, or better yet animated. Lastly, the creature is just so plodding! It's frustrating walking from place to place trying hunches when he barely moves in the first place.  I'd gladly play again for the atmosphere. The devs truly achieved something unique in this little gem, and I'm glad I experienced it.",

What I dislike about this game is that it's a point and click; And not the particularly good kind (Like Monkey Island, or Sam And Max) Most of my attempt at playing this was trying to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ to do, and just seeing what everything did, but it was all obscure (And, like all proper gamers, I refused to use a walkthrough)  All throughout playing this, I was just wondering if I was missing out on something, If I'd forgotten to read something, or just simply didn't get it.  Simply put, I got this in a bundle, and it wasn't my cup of tea. I found it to be confusing, and slow-paced with no goal (to my understanding)",
