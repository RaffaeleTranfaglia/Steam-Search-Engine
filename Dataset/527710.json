            "review_text": "Was thinking of how I'd write up a review for this game. I could talk about how the music, while not enthralling, does not bore. That the graphics and design are better than many other games with a larger price tag. I could talk about how not controlling your fighters directly during a fight leads to tense moments and fist pumps when you snatch victory from the teeth of defeat with less than ten health. I could even talk about how I got emotionally attached to one gladiator and was sad to see her go after we talked in depth about the God of death and mysteries for months in game while she curb-stomped anyone I sent her up against, then felt elated after she wanted to stay on with me even after she won her freedom.  instead, I'll just keep striking home the point that, for the price advertised, this may be the best game of it's type on steam or elsewhere.  Four dollars.  Four dollars for a game that engrossed me enough within the first twenty minutes to take a day off from work just play through.  Four dollars for some pretty spiffy fluff in the form of Lorebooks acquired in game that were actually entertaining enough to read.  Four dollars for a gladiator management simulator that includes marriage options, assiting different factions in side stories, full stories for every fighting slave you can purchase that they share with you.  Four dollars for a game that had me restart five or six times after the initial few hours of playing just to try and see if I could optimize my start or just to change my portrait one last time when I did find how I wanted to start. (Sound familiar fans of Bethesda's Fallout or Elder scrolls games?)  Give it a shot. After all...  ...It's only four dollars.",

            "review_text": "Very pleasant gladiator-training game. Progression is nicely paced, and the storyline gives a feeling a choice and significance, without getting in the way too much of building up the states of your slaves. It's not strategically difficult, the main challenge is working out what you can afford to buy and construct - working out how to stabilize your income is the most difficult part of the game.",

            "review_text": "This game needs a battle speed up option and then it would be close to perfect. Great job team.  8/10 as a game 7/10 in mechanics, some need to be worked on. You can't really tell what reflexes and agility actually do for you, numbers wise (a page that opens and explains it when you click on a stat would solve that nicely), and the game really needs a battle speed up. Otherwise all of the mechanics are enjoyable. Maybe a money bonus from the first tournament would give you more starting gold without giving it to you all at once at the beginning, because money seems a little tight at first.  9/10 based on the kind of game the developers were going for. Remarkably polished for such a cheap game.",
