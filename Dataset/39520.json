    "description": "Itâ€™s the year 1400- the late Middle Ages. Europe sees the dawn of the golden age of the new departures and the free spirit. Under the rule of the bourgeoisie and businessmen, more and more towns are emerging from the clutches of the aristocracy and are achieving independence, power and wealth.",

            "review_text": "One of the best (if not the best) Simulation/strategy games I have ever played and I'm finally glad they added it to steam. I wouldn't even lie if I said I have at least 500+ hours on this game alone and while I played The Guild 2 a lot I still find The Guild 1 much more enjoyable then its sequal.  Although this game is not for everyone I will still HIGHLY recommend playing this one if you want to try it out or if in fact you do love these types of games.  Be aware though that you are going to put a lot of hours in a single playthrough.  Here are my Pros &amp; Cons with at least 500 hours+ of game time.  Pros: - Different businesses/maps to start out. - Random events that can turn in or against your favor. - Courting, No need to feel down if you think you will lose everything cause your character died, have a child! - Offices in which you can rise high and become an important person - Set tax rates, building rates, allow dueling, and lots more, each office has it own powers. - Blackmail/bribe/spy on people and there is a lot more you can do. - Each profession has its ups and downs which also sets the difficulty, want an easy game? try thieves or priests, want a harder game? try landlord or a tailor.  Cons: - Graphics, it is an old game. - Bugs, You will encounter bugs im pretty sure of it. - Some people seem to have a lot of problems running this game (I'm playing this game fine on a 21:9 screen with an Nvidia 970 card). - As a first time player it is incredible hard to get to know the game.",

It should be located somewhere like: 'C:\\...\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Europa 1400 The Guild - Gold Edition' and use the 'Europa1400Gold_Tl.exe' instead. This fixes the issue for me and it runs perfectly smooth. :)",

To play multiplayer, I had to download a program to emulate a LAN and edit the INI file, because the game is configured by default to load multiplayer files from the E drive. When I finally got it working, the loading screen to get in took an eternity. When I finally started playing, the game had a network error and closed almost immediately. Out of 10, I`d rate this game balls/10.",

Make any changes to graphics options and the game may not open and has to be uninstalled and reinstalled for any chance of playing again. All in all, a typical JoWood 'kiss of death' game -- most of the games this company was involved with or collaborated on at the time earned bad reviews, and from this one you will understand why. Almost no effort has been put into making it good.",
