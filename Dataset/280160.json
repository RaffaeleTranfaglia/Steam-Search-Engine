Unique atmosphere, interesting gameplay and achievements (yes, they are fun actually) will make complete this game at least 2 times and if you're going for 100% unlocked stuff it will probably take 4 times to do so. Story is full of mysteries and it's better playthrough, then watch on YT. Also game don't have HUD (at least annoying one), so there not gonna be problems with atmosphere or problems feeling the character. Online is fun as well btw, but better play it with someone you know.",

The art style is really rather pretty and the music adds to the tension as you slink around in the shadows.

The story itself is relatively short, but this is counteracted by the differing ways you can play each level: Not setting off any alerts, not killing any guards or killing everyone.   The movement in this game feels incredibly satisfying and gives an air of freedom, even if you are limited to the shadows to stay hidden.  Whilst your powers start of relatively simple, the games rewards you for exploring each level to find scrolls (which grant skill points), allowing you to grow quite an expansive resevoir of abilities.  Of course, this means the game is completely do-able without exploring for the extra skill points as well.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this if you're a fan of the stealth genre.",

While I think Aragami is not quite as difficult as Dark Souls or 'bullet hell' games, there is still quite a bit of challenge to be had. What I appreciate most is that obstacles can be tackled in any number of ways (take a different route, distract an enemy vs. killing him, etc.).  The art style is really nice, and all of the animations and abilities are supah-smooth. Plus, it just feels damn cool when you summon a shadow creature to take out an enemy. Sound and music are both on point. Holy sh!t man, the boss-level music is SO GOOD. Seriously. My heart rate spiked so hard when that song started playing the first time xD  7/5 - would recommend.",

My biggest problem with the game (And it really was more of an inconvenience) is that the HUD on the cape sometimes wrinkles up and gets caught on the sword which makes it hard to see  A quick shadow hop always fixed this for me though.  It's not incredible or super well polished, but the art style is nice and the game is fun, and challenging at moments. ",

            "review_text": "_-_- SLIGHT POTENTIAL SPOILERS -_-_  This game was interesting, i've been looking for a game like Tenchu for years now and this caught my eye. but ultimately i believe it is not worth the money (£14.99 when i bought it) due to a number of reasons:  Firstly let me point out where this game went well  [Pros]  -Amazing art style: The game looks beautiful and i believe it will age very well. -Mechanically interesting: The Shadow mechanic which is used to maneuver and stay hidden, while also gaining power is done perfectly in my opinion. -Sound and Music: Very good audio cues and traditional japanese music make a nice environment.  On the other hand, the negatives i feel make this game not worth the price  [Cons]  -Short: This game is short, when i mean short, im saying i 100%ed this game in 10 hours, completed every achievement as well as every optional mission complete objective for all 13 missions. My fastest time to complete a level was 7 minutes and i feel that this is a disgustingly weak part of the game.  -Repetitive: This game can be completed simply by either teleporting in a straight line to the next objective (and when i say straight line i mean STRAIGHT), waiting 5 seconds for a guard to move from an orb that blocks the next location. Hitting that orb and moving to the next area. If you are trying to kill every enemy in the missions, its simply teleport behind them, kill, rinse and repeat. Or leading them into a room around the corner, kill, repeat.  -Extremely Easy Difficulty: Every enemy in this game either suffers from cataracts or a severe case of short sight. As long as you stay crouched and teleport around with the use of the shadows, you can be 10 feet infront of any enemy on a bright sunny day. If they do spot you, its simply a quick teleport away and recover. Because of this, the developers put an excessive amount of enemies in an area that just adds to the time of progressing through the level. Once you have unlocked the upgrade to your Bird, you can locate all scrolls in the game, ultimately destroying any level of exploration or fun regarding secrets.  -Lack Luster Boss missions: It just involves the same mechanic of teleporting behind them for a stealth kill just repeated 3 times with a slight alteration of an aeriel kill on the second hit. The final boss is no different but i believe it is 5 times instead.  -Uninteresting Story: the story was generally uninteresting and a bit rushed in my opinion, i believe this is partly due to the shortness of the game and how vague the plot is through out, besides at the end where the plot just begins to open up and i feel that the game could have alot more depth... But it ends. The character development was terrible, what felt like simply throwing characters existences in to give some reason as to why you even exist in the first place. The origins of the Aragami were a good idea to begin with but wasn't correctly followed through.  -2nd to last mission: This mission takes what ive just said about difficulty and doesn't make it harder, it makes it frustrating. Being sniped continously while trying to kill everyone in the map is the most hair pullingly rage inducing thing i've experienced in this game. 85% of my deaths in my 10 hour run were in the last 40 minutes it took me to complete this game under those conditions. IT ISN'T FUN as a mechanic, I see where the developers were going, but i don't believe it fits with the theme by having an aimbotting archer continually rain sweet justice down on the Stealth Assassin that hasn't been spotted or killed anyone since the first mission began. To say, it ruined my immersion.  [IN CONCLUSION]  The game is fun and very pretty, I definitely enjoyed myself but it shouldn't be classed as a full game. If you came here expecting something difficult and gritty, you are only met with hand holding, mediocre challenges and repetition. The story needed a revision and for the price that is requested I wouldn't buy this again if i knew everything i know now.",

        {
            "review_text": "From what I have played of this game, I have only seen a good art-style implemented as one of the very few positives of this game. Even then some of the enemies could be modeled a little better. For the most part the presentation is the best part of this game. The shadow based stealth system, which is just as thin as say, Splinter Cell: Conviction or Blacklist, is passable for the most part. The system is either bugged or intentionally made to where enemies can spot you in shadow if you are within about 10 feet of their line of sight. Aragami has the gall to embue the protagonist to do a MGSV styled mechanic where if you are close to an enemy that spots you, you can quickly react by killing them to keep the alarm off, which the game never explains. There are three expendable weapons that the protagonist has at his disposal. They are pretty standard and feel more like leftovers from Mark of the Ninja. There is no agility to the protagonist, making you rely on the shadow blink to even get up to any height. The animation for some of the kills could be better (not that I'm saying that's a huge negative for any sort of game). This game is a stealth game that relies on checkpoints. Let that sink in for a moment because it's essentially like when you're putting together a puzzle, but when you place the wrong piece in the spot you thought it went to, the entire (or a large chunk of the) puzzle is then taken apart for you to do all over again. The ability you gain to place shadow on the groud feels like they didn't think about it for too long because they basically make you use to to just get to higher spots only due to how quickly the shadows go away. The power itself drains so quickly that I found it better to rely on the also passable level design. The shadow meter you have is also rather garbage at the beginning, especially with the shadow placing power. I'm fully aware you get more meter later on, but it's pretty bad to start with. The only time you get much verticality is when you are indoors for what little time that might be. Most of the powers seem rather ok and none are as fun as Dishonored's, or even Garrett's ultimate setup from Thief 2. At the very least, this game understands that darkness is important to a stealth game unlike Dishonored, but in the case of Aragami that's like having a sniper realize that a rifle would be better for him/her to use over per se a shotgun, but still have no clue how to use a rifle. I understand that I've only played it for almost an hour and a half, but I was sorely disappointed in this simplistically designed game. Thief 2: The Metal Age, Thief: Deadly Shadows, Mark of the Ninja, and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory are stealth games that I would recomend against this one.  EDIT: As it turns out this game is related to a prototype for a game that I had played quite a while earlier called Path of Shadows While the site for Path of Shadows says that Aragami is a completely different game made by a studio funded by the Path of Shadows team, it looks entirely like Aragami had taken much of Path of Shadows' style. The sweet irony is that Path of Shadows plays better than Aragami and in my opinion the protagonist of Path of Shadows has a better design than that of the Aragami protagonist.",

Playing Coop with a friend the whole way through taking only ONE break says something.   Length of the game is also not that bad from the price standpoint. Around 10 hours for a normal playthrough, and yes, we died a lot, a whole heck of a lot.  Aragami is cut up in thirteen chapters with some interesting locations to explore. Some of them are mainly boss encounters. And wow are those encounters cool. It changes the phase of gameplay to a more intense fight, rather than a stealthy approach.  Skillsystem is also in place, giving you a range of skills to choose from, Offense and Defense. Skillpoints is aquired through exploring and finding scrolls. And by the way, Kunai's are in. Shruiken? Not so much.   Replay value; Go for the best scores. Every chapter gives you a grade.

(not getting into how certain pallet choices make determining each light difficult) however none of these really mean that much in terms of stealth just how far away someone can detect you, even in perfect shadow while crouching, you can be detected at a few paces. given that is the distance youll usually be from any given guard.   well you do have a telleport ablity, so theres no reason to no just teleport from one point of cover to the next shadow killing any guard nearby.   In summary the games mechanics are in conflict with the play. the stealth is clunky and unpredictable. level design is uninspiring.

Aragami is a stealth based, third person adventure game that involves the use of shadows and has a very unique art style that I would compare to Mark of The Ninja, if it was 3D. While Aragami doesn't do anything too revolutionary in terms of stealth, it does stay true to it's Tenchu inspired design, and it plays very nicely. The AI is that classic blend of smart enough to be annoying but dumb enough to make stealth work like it should, the animations are beautiful, and the upgrades, while semi limited, offer some variation to the gameplay. I think this is probably one of the two best indie titles put out this year, only rivaled by Furi. The company behind it is new to the scene, and worked with a limited budget to create the most Tenchu reminiscent game I've played since Tenchu Z.  If you're a fan of stealth games, or ninja/feudal japan based games, give Aragami a shot. It's worth your time.",

Playing Coop with a friend the whole way through taking only ONE break says something.   Length of the game is also not that bad from the price standpoint. Around 10 hours for a normal playthrough, and yes, we died a lot, a whole heck of a lot.  Aragami is cut up in thirteen chapters with some interesting locations to explore. Some of them are mainly boss encounters. And wow are those encounters cool. It changes the phase of gameplay to a more intense fight, rather than a stealthy approach.  Skillsystem is also in place, giving you a range of skills to choose from, Offense and Defense. Skillpoints is aquired through exploring and finding scrolls. And by the way, Kunai's are in. Shruiken? Not so much.   Replay value; Go for the best scores. Every chapter gives you a grade.

            "review_text": "Great for people who like Tenchu's gameplay but wanted a story that didn't feel jilted and weirdly occurring in another game entirely. The movement is largely satisfying, the levels progress in difficulty nicely barring one exception, and at least on the first playthrough it does feel like you're increasing in power as you go from level to level and open up options. It teaches you how to play with the base mechanics at exactly the rate it should, nothing feels too rushed, and even though the powers you pick out aren't tutorialed well they're all fairly easy to understand with use. They could probably have afforded to have a few more checkpoints to avoid frustration, but it only really becomes an issue in one level. Looks nice for a unity project, the art style really helps it, but there is an issue with clipping on the character model that affects gameplay eventually. The soundtrack is pretty good, no tracks are obnoxious and some of them are really good and atmospheric.   Overall it's not perfect, but it is pretty good. I'd recommend it.   Pros:  -Fairly satisfying and challenging stealth gameplay. Scouting and planning are naturally encouraged.  -Neat powers that let you choose how to deal with enemies, multiple viable playstyles encouraged.  -Levels are varied enough to keep things from feeling too samey, even if you're basically sneaking through countryside, towns and fortresses in all of them.  -Appealing aesthetic.  -Long for a modern action-type game.  -Really good boss themes and otherwise palatable soundtrack.  -The story is actually pretty good. -Stealth gameplay where the enemies don't feel either entirely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or like they're clairvoyant, at least for the most part.   Cons: -Unity collision detection.  -Spread out check points can sometimes cause frustration.  -At the end of the day, stealth gameplay is stealth gameplay. You're going to largely be doing the same thing from level to level, even if the environments and enemy placement change the method a little bit.  -The second boss fight is one of the worst pieces of gameplay that I have ever experienced.  -Sometimes feels like there is a 'right way' to go about completing certain challenges.  -A lot of the time, screwing up even once leads to a reload.",

You take on the role of an aragami 'clean slate,' or a vengeful spirit. You are summoned to avenge a woman who does not recall why she called you, nor what will happen after the fact. You have a great arsenal of skills behind you to sneak effectively in a world that is filled with light. You must complete your task before the light claims you, before the sun rises.  Pros: -Unique Gameplay -Engaging Story -Artistic Graphics -Ninjas  Cons: -Graphics sometimes glitch -Poor keystroke layout -Multiplayer (Friends List-Based) -Boss battles do not cater to stealth, and detract from it.  There is 'combat' in a strict sense of the word, but only in a fast way. You have less than a couple seconds after being caught to shadow jump up to someone and kill them. Otherwise you run.

Seems memory-leaky... the game gets 'tired' so to speak. Hopefully they will fix this in a future release. Luckily the replay value per level is high enough that I actually don't mind the game crashing occasionally and having to play through a level again.

An overall great game with simple graphics, but still very pretty looking. This game is probably one of the greater stealth based games. The ability to hide in shadows and get spotted in light is amazing. Overall, this game is great and I highly recommend trying it. It requires patience (Which I got none of) and being unpatient often leads to you dying.  Although there is a few things I'd like to mention. Minor things that doesn't affect the game, but affects my mental health.  1. The sound when you die. The sound from the lightwave that hits you makes you go deaf. You would think this is under the normal sound options but no. No sound option covers this sound. This is annoying as hell cause I don't want my ears blown out. 2. Checkpoooooooints... Getting killed in the last second of a 15 minutes long mission? Noo... I Hate that. At least give me the possibility to save manually? But no. Checkpoints that only come every 15 to 20 minutes... This mixed with the lightwave and the ♥♥♥♥ing sniperarchers that oneshots you, can make this very annoying.  As I said, these are minor details. I Still enjoy the game with these.",
