Quite fast paced for a 'tactical' shooter but enjoyable. The co-op mode is super fun.  Wait for an Ubisoft sale and if it's there, take it!",

            "review_text": "Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a much needed improvement over the original game, and it improved aspects of the original game's design without changing very much of the overall gameplay.  The biggest addition Vegas 2 added was the ability to customize your character. Instead of playing as a gruff southerner named 'Logan' you instead play as a customizeable character named 'Bishop'. Bishop can be male or female and his/her apperance can be heavily customized. You're given the option to pick between what clothing Bishop wears and what armor you wear. Which will impact how much damage reduction you get and how fast you move.   In addition Rainbow Six Vegas 2 helped start the trend towards unlock based multiplayer. Now you played as a character who was universal across Terrorist hunt and PVP. And your character would gain stats in both singleplayer and multiplayer, which would unlock new guns and cosmetics. This was really popular at the time and reminded me a lot of multiplayer games like Syphon Filter the Omega Strain. These were all great improvements and made the game feel very fresh and new. It made it feel more akin to an RPG despite leveling being automatic and the game fundamentally playing the same. The multiplayer was expanded to have many more gamemodes. And Terrorist hunt was expanded to be much more customizeable.   There's actually very little I can say that's negative about Rainbow Six Vegas 2 apart from how they didn't really change very much about the actual gameplay, so it still has the same flaws like the general stiffness to the combat. The storyline is also a bit weaker. And if you're a fan of older style Rainbow Six games, you're going to remain disappointed.  All that aside though, it's a very effective sequel. And there's little wonder why it's more fondly remembered than the first game.",

Unlike the Call of Duty these kids are playing these days this game requires 'skill' or talent at especially at higher difficulties. This game is rather hard at parts on normal even more so towards the end of the game.  You can command 2 allies or you can simply set them to auto-fire and follow you. You can set them up for door breaches and more tasks, tell them to use silencers and go passive (Shoot when shot at) If you prefer stealth. They are interesting charactors but not enough to where you care about them like a pet dog. More like a hamster.  The story is great and fun, it is a fantastic story for a fantastic game.  This game is highly customizable with many cosmetic options and gun attachments. To unlock the cosmetics you must progress in the game and get experiance for doing different tasks and level up your main level, you must get to certain levels on certain skills to unlock guns aswel. Some people might not like this but It gives a feel of progression that I love.  This game has more modes than story gving it replayability, co-op, muliplayer and terrorist hunt. The first 2 are simple, play with other people with or against them. But the 3rd, you are thrown in an area told to kill a certain number of terrorists with, if you are playing with friends, some extra lives if so chosen. Single player isn't much harder as you can have commandable allies from the story mode. This is gamemode is tons of fun.  Buy this game, it is amazing.",

Coz of the cover system and the character customisation  In the past, Rainbow Six have always used Leaning as a cover system but when Rainbow Six Vegas came out, i was surprised by how smooth the cover system is. One of the best, in my opinion. You have to experience it yourself to understand how much i love this game  The character customisation is just... So much fun to play around with. In which game can you actually affect how your character will look like in-game ? What ? Call of Duty Blackops ? HAH, that is just a preset look that comes with certain perks that you have equiped. In Rainbow Six Vegas, you can customise your character piece by piece, camo by camo. Heck, you can make yourself look like a colourful clown and kick Terrorist ♥♥♥ looking like a fool, literally. Or you can do what i do. Match the environment with camouflage and roleplay with the customisation to match different situations.  Some may not like this game, im sure, but at least try it out.  I give Rainbow Six Vegas 2 a 7/10 May not be the greatest game ever but it's well above average. Although it will not feel like the old Rainbow Six games, it still has its difficulty. If you want a real challenge, play on Realistic; it's pretty crazy...",

Now I may be excited for Seige to come out, but this will always be my favorite game in the Rainbow Six series. If I could add on my hours from the Xbox, I bet my bottom dollar that I would rack up over 300 hours in this game. Thats how much replay value this game has.

Play with up to 3 others, allowing you to chat to others in a realistic enviroment, forcing you to move slowly and listen carefully for the movement of enemies.   If you play on realistic difficulty, the terrorists will usually will kill you incredible fast, even with heavy armour. This makes for strategic play and a high requirement for team skill.  Being pretty old, the AI isn't the smartest and they have near 100% accuracy.  The graphics are slightly pasty and the friendly AI in single player is slightly incompetent at times.

The idea the developers had was to make it hard enough that you wanted to bother someone else to play and then the awareness of this game would grow and spread through the connections people form over their lives. I cannot stand by this exploitation of games. If you have trouble making friends then games like these are just a sick pathetic attempt to gain popularity through dismissing ones abilities to overcome challenges.  I have actually managed to complete the single player campaign on the hardest difficulty but the whole experience was absolutely horrible and condemning. Having to wait for the dumbest AI to try to flank me just so I can one hit kill them from blind cover with a spaz is so easy and gets so boring quickly you’ll find yourself trying to do something fun up until you are one hit killed and punished for how you choose to play the game.  tl;dr version Get the game if you have a friend you can play with",

Terrorist hunt still has a decent amount of people playing, but I like I said that's not where this game truly shined. Besides that the customization is top notch. But the core game modes being abandoned and the scarcity of it all, just makes it not worth spending money on. I'd play SIEGE, or look elsewhere.",

Your mission -- to track down the dangerous Cabrero cartel in possesion of deadly chemical agents through the city of Vegas. The fun and easy squad tactics combined with the unique environments and map layouts make for some interesting scenarios in taking out the bad guys. The graphics aren't too bad for its time, and the voice acting is exceptionally well done. One of the best parts about the game is its customizable elements. From your apparel to your combat loadout, you can tweak everything to your liking.  The only downsides are a limited arsenal, a drawn-out leveling process, and a boring playing experience once you've earned all the gear and acheived prestige level. The three difficulty tiers all feel the same, as well.  All other things aside, with campaign, versus mode, and the additional terrorist hunt mode, this game is quite a steal for $10. It's certainly worth your time.",

The notion of holding a key down for cover, then a key for iron sights, then my SMG spraying a nice silhouette around my target was pretty irritating.

The only franchise of games made by Ubisoft that's based truly on the works of the late great Tom Clancy, Rainbow Six is a long running series of tactical shooter games. This here is the latest entry in the series.   Being the 'sequel' to RS: Vegas, this game (obviously) takes place in the city of Las Vegas. Team Rainbow must stop a series of terrorist attacks throughout the city. This is the same premise as the last game. Not only is the basic plot almost the same as te last game but, pretty much everything is. It doesn't feel like a sequel but rather an expansion pack or something.  The difficulty is just horrendous when the buggy A.I. barely works. You going lone wolf most of the time with you team somewhere else. Another thing is the enemy A.I. They're ultimate deadeyes with guns. Their shots are just physically impossible to make in reality. (I assume) Currently, I can't think of anything that I liked about the game. 12 hours were invested to it trying make it work after my singleplayer data constantly kept deleting.   That's it.",

Now for the long review Raibow Six Vegas 2 takes place in the same time period as the first game,now if you haven't played the first Rainbow Six Vegas game then the story won't make much sense to you but if you have(like me)then you'll know some of the story elements.But I don't play these games for the story I play them for their complex strategy and punishing gameplay if you make a mistake,and does this game have the same amount of depth as Rainbow Six 3? No it doesn't,not even close.That's because Ubisoft tried to focus WAY more on the story(which is an improvement over Rainbow Six Vegas 1 but it still isn't all that great)and they tried to make both Vegas games mainstream but in doing so they've made both games(especially this one)just too easy I died like maybe 5-6 times during the story where as in Rainbow Six 3 I dies so many times trying to create the perfect strategy in order to save the hostage(s)without losing a single man.  So now you might be asking yourself'So why are you giving this game a positive review then?'Well that's because they've made this game so much more fun than Raibow Six Vegas 1.Like to start off the level design is WAY better than the first Vegas game which means there are no longer any cheap deaths due to cheap enemy placement and your team is no longer braindead like the previous Vegas game and for that reason your team is way more useful now.This game also has stealth which isn't all that bad but it isn't good either because it boils down to 'If the enemy sees their dead friend and see bullet holes on the wall then the stealth is over and it's time to pull out your big guns'The strategy isn't all that complex but it is required in order to win.The shotguns are no longer OP and kill you in one shot(most of the time)which is great.The 'one mistake and you're dead'part of Rainbow Six 3 is pretty much gone I made some mistakes in this game where I should've died but I somehow didn't but that doesn't mean that I managed to survive all the time from my mistakes.This game is also pretty short I beat it in 7 hours but boy did I have a fun time in those 7 hours.  As I said in the begining if you're new to the series then first get Rainbow Six 3 and then get this game in order to know what the games are all about,but if you have that game then(read in Duke Nukems voice)'What are you waiting for Christmas?'",

I love this game, even the single player and everything, great mechanics and stuff, hardcore difficulty and a great Rainbow Six game, but without the online it feels stripped off. So this is just a warning, it doesn't work for everyone. The game itself has great customization and is amazingly fun with friends, if you're even able to play it with friends as of Ubiservers. The tactical elements to it are really great and makes me feel as if i'm playing some kind of fast paced but tactical shooter instead of running and gunning and i like that. I won't say much though, it's a great game, go get it. 50% of chance the game will work for you, other 50% is for that it doesn't log in and CD Key doesn't work. Good luck!  9.8/10 ~Great game whenever it wants to work (Refund if it doesn't and buy it again with renewed hope i guess)",
