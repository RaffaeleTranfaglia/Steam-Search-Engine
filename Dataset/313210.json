            "review_text": "Where to start, I could call this the worst game ever made and I wouldn't be wrong. To truely understand just how horrific this game is a person needs only turn it on for the first time. I am pretty certain I got this game for less than a dollar, and that is one dollar I'll never see back.  This game is worse than one of those free flash games you get from a shady website that pop's up while your surfing for porn in the middle of the night. In fact many of those games are far superior to this mess.  I'd say this game is like getting a root canel, as the numbing agent starts to wear off and you can feel the dentist begin to kill the roots in your teeth. Except having that done is probably more fun than this flaming pile of refuge.  Please do yourself a favor, take that dollar you would have spend playing this game, set it on fire and place the charred remains between two slices of bread.... you would get more value out of your money this way...  Although if you do buy the game, keep in mind you'll join the ranks of gamers like myself who love picking up crap...",

            "review_text": "I played the first level and here's what happened. I had to map the keys with Xpadder to a 360 controller because the defaults require 0 and 1 as keys and my laptop has fourth row keys for numbers (Zero and One are on opposite sides). Now instead of changing them I decided to skip/upgrade straight to a controller but it doesnt change the horrible basics of control in the game. First flaw, left and right are called left and right but up and down are labeled forwards and back which is the opposite of intuitive. The enemies are either blind and deaf or they see you from off screen and when you crouch you move slowly foward. I felt like I was playing a lighting demo and the game was coded in an hour to use said lighting. Lame.",

You play as a badass soldier who rely only on his tiny little knife to fight the armed enemies. You will have your unlimited ammo guns later in the game because why not. Each level have different objectives and yeah different traps and enemies.  And please throw out your logic while playing this game. This is a video game, nothing is weird. Although I admit there is a racist in the city level where you fight 'rooftop thugs' that's all black-men and their leader is a white-man called '12 cent'",
