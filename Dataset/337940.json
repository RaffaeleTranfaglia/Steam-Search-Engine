            "review_text": "X-note is a very straight forward visual novel which is refreshing after playing so many with tons of endings and twist and turns. I was able to fully enjoy discovering the story without the worry of making a mistake that could set me back hours of game play (which has happened before in other games due to a poor save point choice on my part.)  I also found this game the perfect length. Not to short that I feel as though I wasted my money and not to long that it feels as though it was dragged out more then it needed to be it get the point across.  The art is beautifully and I enjoyed the look and feel it brought to the overall story since it fit very well. I can't wait to play more games by this developer because I'm really liking the stories they tell within their games.  Overall I can highly recommend this game if you enjoy games with a interesting story with a bit of mystery, amazing art that adds to the setting and fits with the mood, theme and feel of what the game represents and a game that you are able to complete in a few hours and feel as though you had a great time playing when you have all the pieces of the story put together.",

            "review_text": "X-Note is an exceptionally well-polished game considering how few people worked on it. The story is revealed in parts during the various plot lines so you don't get the full picture until you've played them all. I thought the music was well-suited to the mood and I loved the artwork.  My only problem with the game is that you cannot skip the skill training. It's all well and good the first time but having to train 30 times per plot line sucked balls.",

It was very enjoyable and a lot of fun. I loved the mini games and really enjoyed the main three playthroughs with Yuon, Oure, and Anon. The only thing I don't like is a minor problem, not being able to skip previously read dialog, but it is exacctly that, a minor inconvenience.",

            "review_text": "One Sentence Summary- If you like graphical novels, you'll probably like his game.  If you are not familiar with them, you may like it, you may not. All in all, the game plays as if it is 80% graphical novel, and 20% like an actual game. First, let me say the positives:  +Nice Artwork +Fun characters +Appropriate Music +Very much like a Japanese Anime (if you like that) +Is mostly based upon a mystery, but has some romance elements +Thankfully, as far as I can tell, the romance elements are fairly clean and innocent. +Multiple Endings  -Doesn't seem like the choices you make alter the story very much. -You play as a teenage girl in a game with some romance elements (a minus if you're a guy) -The game ends very abruptly if you get the bad ending, which I did. -Unless you have some foreknowledge, most people will have to start over to get past chapter 4 (I think). This should be optional to get a better ending, but it feels punishing to make you start over from the beginning in order to progress further.  As to whether or not I recommend this game, I'm on the fence. If you like this type of game, get it on sale. If not, get something else. However, the game is fairly good for what it is, so I'll give it a thumb up.",

It's fascinating, mysterious and cryptic plus beautifully drawn and constructed. I thought this game would bore me easily at first, but within the first few minutes I was pleasantly sucked into this world. To me, it felt as if I was watching an anime, just without voice narrative and more moving pictures. This game has 8 endings and you have to get all 8 to unlock a secret section of the game, which I found cool. This game is amazing and I highly recommend you give it a shot, lets see if you to find the secret behind the School ^_^!!",
