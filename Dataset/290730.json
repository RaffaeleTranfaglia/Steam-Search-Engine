No music (I don't really need it as the longer you play this game the less you have to be on because building times and such get higher and higher) Some people are falsely claiming that you have to wait 3 days for a building to go from Level 2 to 3 what's totally wrong. You can adjust the laborers you have who build your city and adjusting the amount of laborers changes the build time. I have to wait about 2 hours with 320 builders to achieve level 3 Castle. Microtransactions; Seems to be evened out quite nicely, no massive P2W stuff except that you can buy higher production rate what gives you an advantage over other players.  I have yet to explore the attacking part of the game.",

Pros: -You can't loose your cities. -Enemies can't force you to move away from territory. -Level-based enemies ensure, that you won't be attacked early on. -Level-based enemies ensure, that you can't attack much weaker players. -It's not a P2W. Buy-able things aren't going to help you win against others that much! -Usage of Closing Gates prevents enemies to attack you!  Cons: -Researching does take quite a lot of time. -Research does cost much at high level, which brings the game to a halt, unless you pay. -Large armies requiring time to feed. -At maximum level you can be attacked by the top players. -Equipment for your heroes are OVER-priced. OVER-priced. Only the best can afford them. -Equipment for your heroes cost so much, that is not worth the irl $. Totally OVER-priced.  Suggestion: Worth to try it out! If it's magic captures you, you'll be liking it. A nice way to spend 30 minutes of the day.",

THEY WANT YOU TO SPEND REAL LIFE MONEY on the game....  so yes... i am a bit upset that after finally making 5 star rank... i get totaly destroyed by a whole allaince attacking me .. they send therir lower ranked people to kill buildings and defensives.. and as a higer ranked player you cant do anything to stop them but hide your troops and try to rebuild... but that is a loosing proposition... so when you try to fight back.. the players that are the same rank as you.. (remember thy lower ranked has alread devistated your defenses) the attack and kill off all your troops... now you have to rebuild EVERYTHING all over...   since this game is based on ALL attack... all rankings are based on wining attacks... there is nothing based on trying to defend... no defensive states... and no real defensive stratagies except for staying small and not letting the ranked players attack... at that is the real reason i give this game a NO.... the game has no balance",

You develop your castle, no hassle, everything seems to be fine. But then 'Bang! you have 24 hours to complete blah-blah-blah' and that 'blah-blah-blah' requires investing real money - 'choose your subscription plan'. Even more - the benefits the game offers in return doesn't seem to be really the needed ones. After 3 such occasions, with ever growing demands of investments - I can only say 'Booo!!!'. If you really want to play you're likely to find yourself spending sums comparable to AAA titles or even exceeding them. US$399 for some 'black gems'...  What's good in it? Support for multiple languages, works in win10, doesn't have any powerful 3d graphics, and probably that's all.  Such games are typically run in web browsers and don't have dedicated client.  The bad? It'll try to grab way over $10 out of your pocket.",

It says, 'Here's a quest: click that thing and build it.' I do so. I wait several minutes to hours. Then it says, 'Here's another quest: click that other thing and build it.' I do so. I wait several minutes to hours. Rinse. Repeat. Realize that progress in this game is P2W, and incredibly tedious. Quit and write negative review.  I don't know how this game currently has 88% positive reviews, because it definitely isn't that good. Somebody may have rigged the reviews. My guess is that with time, that'll get down below 50%.  The mentorship system seems to be a broken one. Mentors gain rewards when their apprentices accomplish quests, but there is no motivation for the mentor to actually do anything to help the apprentice. You can request resources from the mentor, but they don't have to give them to you. I'm not sure, but it seems like you can't fire your mentor, either. Once you've accepted them, they own you, and leech off of you.  You should also be aware that no matter how much progress you've made in the game (even if you've been playing for years), they'll delete your kingdom if it's inactive for between 7-30 days. So... basically, what's the point of playing this?  How many more terrible design decisions are there that I'm not aware of, yet?  It's just too bad, because there's something very tempting about the slow-growth style of this game. But why waste any time on it if you'll just lose it all when real life happens?",
