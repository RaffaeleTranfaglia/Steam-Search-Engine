            "review_text": "Lamia's Game Room  Lamia's Game Room is a casual card game done by Digital Crafter. Lamia's Game Room is a mystery card game that plays [for me] similar to Old Maid, with a visual novel type story tied to it. It's a bit short, it took me about 4-5 hours to beat and get all of the achievements. At the time I played, spelling and grammatical errors plauged the entire game.  The game is all about fooling your opponent by playing your cards and when you can, expressions right. You got a 'Lamia' card you need to get your opponent to take and hold onto, so they 'lose.' I focued more on the gameplay then the story, though I didn't feel it very interesting.The levels starting out were rather simple, easy to catch on and get into the rhythm. Towards the end, the characters you're playing against get a lot better and their factial give aways are no longer always accurate.  I recommend this on I enjoyed the gameplay and goth-style art, though this game is NOT for everyone.",

            "review_text": "This is a card game with a sinister story that needs a complete rewrite.   In Lamia's game room you play a young man who has been trapped in a room with others, the only hope of escaping being behind winning in a card game.   While the art is nice, the atmosphere creepy and the premise interesting -- as well as the card game not being based purely on luck -- the game falls short thanks to one of the most horrible writing and translation jobs I've ever seen. The VN style story bits are full of unnecessary '...' and exposition/thoughts written out as dialogue. The English translation is weak at best and full of typos. The most glaring is the 'cancle' = cancel option in the card game scenes.   This would be a very interesting casual VN/card game hybrid if only you didn't have to wade through a sea of bad writing.",

            "review_text": "Very interesting game.Let's get straight to the point  Art- Amazing. Each character that I encountered looked like it had alot of love put into it. Except for that afro lady, I think it was drawn by a 5 year old.  Story- Intriguing. I don't want to spoil anything but little by little your interaction reveals some parts of the story. It's nothing deep but it's not boring either  Gameplay- It seems like it is RNG dependent, but the game actually goes a little deeper than that. Each personality has a weakness that you have to exploit and find out from the dialogue before the game. That let's you force them to reconsider the cards they are picking. I can't seem to find a pattern for lamia and the bunny though..  Quality- Poor. Let's not beat around the burning bush here, the quality is terrible. There are grammar and spelling mistakes everywhere and the dialogue is very unpolished. I wish the developer had someone to proofread or edit the game before release  Overall, I would definitely recommend it for the price, since it's only a dollar. Looking forward to a sequel since the ending was a kind of a cliffhanger",
