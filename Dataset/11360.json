    "description": "Chains is a challenging puzzle game with a unique feel and distinctive vector graphics style. The object of the game is simple - to link adjacent bubbles of the same color into chains. As you progress through the physics-driven stages it becomes increasingly more challenging and players' speed, strategy and skill will be put to the test.",

            "review_text": "From the makers of 'Obulis' (also reviewed by me) comes this nice physics engine game. First: The game 'Chains' is no big deal. That means the game mechanics are quite simple and the graphics are flatten. But what it makes special is the relaxing chillout soundtrack in the background. Never felt so comfortable in a game.  The levels are generally easy. You have to link the same colored bubbles to chains, as longer as better. Sometimes there are pretty inventive modes like calculation numbers inside the bubbles to a balance or to deny downfalling bubbles to block a tube by upchaining and eliminate them. There's all kind of challenge and entertainment you can expect from a good puzzle game.  Take a -90% Coupon and pay only 40 Cent to tryout all the great 20 levels.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those games that takes a fairly simple premise and expands it into a short but challenging puzzle game with a surprising amount of depth.   Gameplay is simple: connect dots of the same color to make them disappear, satisfy an objective unique to a given level to advance. What's impressive is how many different objectives  2DEngine.com  came up with using a limited range of tools. Ranging from simple objectives such as get a high score to more complicated objectives such as keep a stream with multiple choke points flowing for 5 minutes.   The aesthetic is simple, colored dots and silhouette containers.That and the simplistic menu design are reminiscent of Flash games, but it doesn't have much impact on the game. Music's not bad, it seems to get louder when you get closer to failing an objective, but not much to write home about.  Overall, it's a decent game, there's a couple hours of quality gameplay, maybe a little more if you're into score attack.",

Most of the levels have nothing to do with puzzles; just speed, luck, and precise clicking is necessary. Furthermore, the goal of many levels is not what I expect from a casual game, like 'keep 100% concentrated for 5 minutes and if you are lucky, you pass'. There are many things that aren't exactly wrong but could have been done much better, e.g. balls/background color combinations or sounds - the music might be cool but it lacks any relation to what is happening in the game (for example, it could change when the number of missed balls gets near the limit).",

So here's what you wanna try and do  &gt;Start the first level up &gt;Play it past completion &gt;Then try and get one of the three sections to be all the same colour  My friend and I gave it a go the other night and after about an hour of trying, I gave up and went outside to chain smoke (no pun intended)  This game is a nice bit of mindless fun that, if you want to, you can truly think about and try very hard to get all the colours to be the same.  If I was to describe my experience with trying to get all the colours the same I would probably say its like a packaged version of suicidal depression!  Over all 8/10 needs more water",

Another alt+tab didn't fix the issue so I had to use task manager. Also with some resolution options the games frame rate is unlimited and produces coil whine.   But gameplay-wise it's not a bad puzzler and has different challenges. So despite those aforementioned bugs (not a constant issue) I would still recommend it, just not for the asking price of 5 €. Wait for a sale.",
