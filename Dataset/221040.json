As far as I know RE 5 was a console port, too. But the difference was, that you didn't noticed. In RE 6 for instance there's a   button for dashing   and the   same button is used for action   such as climbing ledges. So imagine you're running from a B.O.W. and you walk pass a ledge. You automatically climb that ledge because you hold the   Dash / Action   button. This brings me to the parts, where you have to run from a giant B.O.W. or a helicopter (   Yes, a helicopter, but I'll come back to this later.   ). You dash in a particular direction and you see a ledge. You climb it automatically, and you think here it comes in handy, right? Wrong! You should release the action button and walk two steps away from the ledge, because the protagonist is going to climb automaticall down again. And up again, and down again and repeat. This caused 7+ deaths on the same spot.  Let's get to the gameplay itself. You start for the first time with a prelude which you're going to recognize later in the game. In this prelude you will be introduced to every possible situation that you will encounter in the game, such as dashing, quicktime-event like situation where you have to mash your button sometimes or react at the right time.   The quicktime-event parts are the only thing that are better than in Resident Evil 5!       The Story    There are four campaigns:   Leon    Chris   Jake   Ada     Foreword",

CAPCOM did a nice job finding the balance of old RE4 and the new combat mechanics for RE6. Player satisfaction is high when achieving that awesome melee attack after stunning your enemy or counterattacking(bloodshots am I right??? :) I hope they continue to improve on responsiveness when executing certain actions.   RE6 is not really big on the horror. There are points when you may feel some urgency to get things perfectly executed but no beads of sweat should be dripping. Not too many jumpscares. Jumpscares are really only good the first time around then you can anticipate them, If you want some RE style jumpscares I recommend RE4(for similar mechanics) , or RE2.   One thing I didnt like was the QTEs. CAPCOM decided to go nuts on Leon's campaign with it, Im glad the other campaigns had very little. Sometimes you just want to sit back and enjoy some story but not be immersed into a sudden button press that you will miss and die from.   2013 graphics compared to 2015 graphics.... They are okay, but what if they waited to release it for the XBOX 1 and PS4? It would have been beautiful. Witcher 3 has set the bar high for my tastes.",

            "review_text": "This is probably one of the best examples of 'mixed bags' that I can think of. Resident Evil 6 is both great and horrible in so many ways I won't be able to go over them all but for that reason alone I feel it's a game for anyone who considers themselves a 'gamer' should play at least once to see what I mean.    RE6 is an action title with the occasional horror aesthetic thrown in to tie itself in whith its lineage. While best played with a friend it's very much playable solo. Players will take control one of 3 pairs of characters (or possibly an additional duo or a single character for the fourth campaign) as they experience the story of the game from three different perspectives and this is where the idea of the mixed bag begins. Instead of a single cohearent script, its divided amoungst three different stories that constantly leaves the player confused and in a stupor. Even with all the campaigns completed I had to read some of the in-game lore from the easily missed extras menu once I shot enough blue emblems in the game. While the Resident Evil series isn't known for its story, previous entries were at least easy to understand, not the case with this title, often throwing characters at the player that even veterans have no idea as to who they are.   Controling the characters is another issue for this game. In many games designed with a controller in mind, often times a button is used as a modifier for every other button. In previous games, what would be holding down the left trigger would then make the character aim at which point the right will fire. While that is a simple method, RE6 has layers of these that are poorly explained if at all. New players should take their time figuring out the controls as even into my second campaign I was still learning what certain combinations of buttons and motions did. However once learned, the complex control scheme actually makes for excellent stylish feats but not everyone will get used to them.   Probably one of the best things about the title is how it can incorporate multiplayer into the campaign. With certain options selected, a player can allow others online to join the game as a co op partner, random players to take control of basic enemies for a little extra challange, and even run into other players who are in other campaigns in overlapping story sections where up to four players can take on a segment of their campaigns together. The only problem with this is that due to the small playerbase many of these things wont happen without coordination with other players such as through Steam groups.   While there is definitly more to say I feel that these are some of the biggest issues. I do enjoy the game despite all its faults, however I will say that it may be my least favorite of the RE series that I have experienced. Many others damn this game as complete garbage, and while not all of their complaints are invalid or wrong, it does have entertainment value and some excellent points. If you are looking for a coop third-person action title, there are not many on the market but you should not settle for this unless you are already played through better titles. Give it a look but be aware it is flawed.",

            "review_text": " So the short and skinny of Resident Evil 6   There are 4 campaigns to play through that intertwine with each other that can lead to a lot of similar fights and locations being revisited. This can makes the game campaigns feel slightly lazy in comparison to previous games. However, other than the final campaign mission that was offered as dlc, each campaign is approximately 4 hours long. You couple the repetitiveness of the main campaign with some very Bollywood action sequences and it really is a toss-up whether or not you will enjoy it. Personally, I had no problem with it because if you can accept monsters, mutants, and zombies then you might as well suspend disbelief on the rest as well.   Where the game really REALLY shines is the mobility of play style and improved combat system. There is sliding, rolling, jumping onto your back, running (like really running, not just the light jog from previous games), countering attacks, and a bit more.    Oh and it has  LOCAL COOP , the fact is, if you have one friend, just one friend that will visit you to play games Resident Evil 6 is fantastic. Sure, the way the split screen works is a bit funky and very poorly implemented but I personally have zero problems with it. Therefore, if you have a single friend to play games with and an extra controller I promise you your game play will generally be a lot of fun. However, if you play Resident Evil 6 alone, the game will be a bit of a slog at times.  Despite some obvious negatives you do get your money's worth when purchasing this game.",

            "review_text": "Resident Evil 6 (RE6) is the third Resident Evil game I’ve played (only played 4, 5, and 6 since I don’t have a Playstation). The game has a relatively low metacritic rating (69 last I checked) but I found it to be exactly what I expected after playing RE5 a year earlier. If you’ve only seen the Resident Evil movies then you may not be aware that the games have a completely different storyline and I think they’ve been retconned a few times as well. You would probably recognize a bunch of the characters though since almost every Resident Evil character I know appears in RE6.  The game is a third person “over the shoulder” game played in coop with another person. Just like Resident Evil 5, if you don’t have a friend playing with you, the computer controls the other guy. There are 4 campaigns for you to play and in each of them you can play one of the 2 characters. The campaigns all intersect multiple times so you might be playing the Leon campaign and run in to Chris Redfield. Then when you’re playing the Chris campaign you run into Leon and play as the other side of the encounter. It’s a great way to see the plot from various viewpoints and you’ll understand why characters are acting in a certain way. After you’ve completed the game you can go back and play as the second character in each campaign as well. There’s over 50 hours of gameplay to be had in single player alone. Each campaign is divided into chapters and each chapter into sections, for example Leon Campaign Chapter 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc. The game saves at checkpoints during each section, so if you’re knocked out and your partner doesn’t revive you in time, you restart at the checkpoint. Your inventory is saved between sections and you can replay previous sections freely. There is no more “inventory screen,” now it’s just a quick menu where you hold a button to display and scroll through your items. There is no level up system, but you can gather “exp” points to unlock perks such as improved damage or better aim stability. Then you can pick which 3 perks you want equipped between missions. So you can replay levels over and over for more exp or replay some of the bosses a few times for fun.  I believe the complaint that a lot of Resident Evil purists had was that beginning with RE5, the games aren’t really “survival horror” anymore. Now the focus is on action and shooting. I remember in RE4 that conserving ammunition was a big challenge so you use melee attacks as much as possible. The melee system has been enhanced a great deal since then and ammunition has become a lot more plentiful (you can also replay levels to grab ammo and then just save + quit). You’ll definitely do a lot of shooting, but you should definitely master the hand to hand (or knife fighting depending on which character you’re playing).   Storywise, the game picks up a few years after Resident Evil 5. The world is continuing to circle the drain as various warlords around the world use biological weapons to create zombies and other super powered monsters. Each campaign has its own antagonist though they cross over a lot, as mentioned earlier. If you haven’t played the previous games you might not understand a few “peculiarities” of the playable characters. I certainly didn’t know who some of the people were and the ways that their backstories drive the game’s plot. It is mostly understandable though if you play the whole game through. Just accept that everyone knows each other from previous games.  Pros: +Excellent built in co-op play for the campaign, and for different game modes like Mercenaries. Steam sells the “complete pack” that includes everything, kind of like a Game of the Year edition. +Very long game (at least 35 hours even if you rush), you’ll get your money’s worth. +A lot of replay value (you can unlock “perks” by grinding for exp). +You can play as a monster! Join someone’s game and ♥♥♥♥ them up. A few people tried dropping into my brother and my games, but since we were on levels with only normal zombie enemies (so they spawned as normal zombies), we blew them away easily lol.  Cons: -Multi player is kind of dead now. Hard to find a game to join unless it’s a friend inviting you or vice versa. -According to Resident Evil “purists” the game is more action than “survival horror.” If you’re new to Resident Evil games and just looking for a co-op shooter, this won’t bother you. -There are a few times when you need to run through an area in a short amount of time (like escaping a giant enemy) and the camera keeps subtly shifting so you slightly change running directions and hit a wall or something, then you die. This is VERY annoying but only happens in a few areas. Most of the time you can play leisurely.  Overall I would definitely recommend Resident Evil 6 if you like action games and / or zombie bashing games. The visuals are disturbing and the monsters are grotesque, as expected in a Resident Evil game. The game is 100% better if you have a friend to join your game for coop play. And once you’re done with the campaigns you can spend a lot of time on the various game modes that are included, most especially the Mercenaries mode, which returns from Resident Evil 5. It’s kind of like a survival mode where you try to live to the end of the timer killing as many enemies as you can. The enemy types keep changing until you’re fighting mini bosses.  ",

            "review_text": "Terrible game. There's a lot of content, but it's stretched thin. Has multiple campaigns with quite a bit of recycled content in each one. Makes you watch the same long cutscenes repeatedly. Controls are awful and inventory management is unintuitive and clunky. The melee combat is frustrating; moves are supposed to be contextual so when you go to strike an enemy on the ground you should stomp on them, but sometimes your character will decide to swing the air above them instead. I was in a coop game where my partner had a zombie pin him on the ground, so I turned around and repeatedly roundhouse kicked the air above the zombie while it ate his face off. The button to run is the same button to climb ladders and jump up or down ledges so you will frequently do one thing when you meant to do another. It has bad checkpointing so you'll replay tedious sections repeatedly. It's full of unecessary and annoying quicktime events that cause instant game overs, far more than any other Resident Evil game. It also has a major bug in Jake's campaign that halts progression in coop that requires a workaround to continue progression.   The worst part of the game is it frequently takes away control to make you look at something the game wants to tell you is important, unfortunately the enemies don't stop when this happens so the game is full of cheap deaths where you will be killed by an enemy that approached you and jumped on you during a cutscene. See a zombie approaching you? No problem, I'll just take out my shotgun... no the game wants me to look at some random door that I would've found myself... and I'm on the ground with the zombie on top of me and I'm dead.   The game is full of heavily scripted sequences. The game wants you to conserve ammo, but it is also full of scripted encounters with bosses with high health pools, and shooting them will either damage them or not depending on whether or not you're in a scripted sequence or not. It is beyond frustrating to use half your ammo on a boss only to realise that you can't actually damage him yet because the game hadn't decided you're at the scripted point in which you can. Once you have played these encounters out a few times you will begin to wonder every time you reach a boss whether you should shoot him or not or wait for a truck to run him over (often the correct decision). It doesn't just affect bosses but normal enemies. During quicktime events your partner will often not be able to do anything to help you. In my coop game a zombie grabbed my partner and slowly killed him over the course of about half a minute. During that time I unloaded half my shotgun ammo into him, a zombie type we had encountered before and typically took two rounds to take down. But because the game decided the only important thing was whether he passed the quicktime event, that zombie was invincible. You will also run into zombies lying on the ground numerous times that you know are obvious threats. You can shoot them but your bullets will have no impact. Even though you know they're a threat, you have to walk past them where they will stand up and are only then able to be damaged.   The coop is poor compared to Resident Evil 5 or other coop games. There is no resource sharing so if your partner runs out of ammo and you have a ton, that person is just going to have to go on a punching spree until they find some more. You can't give first aid kits or medical supplies to your partner either, although you can use them on them. This is such a basic feature and it was important in Resident Evil 5, so its omission here is glaring.   It doesn't play like a survival horror game; I don't have any problem with that in itself but the game is trying to be an action game instead. When you compare it to other action games it doesn't hold up well at all. If you are considering buying this game, get Gears or War, Bulletstorm, Spec Ops: The Line, or one of the newer Tomb Raider games. Or Resident Evil 4. They're all significantly better than this game and tread the same ground.",

All these nerd as$ fanboys are complaining and moaning that RE lost its roots. This is downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.... Not all of us are into that ♥♥♥♥.

Games progress and try new things, and in this case... Change isn't really a bad thing. Only you can decide by picking up this game :]",

            "review_text": "Biohazard 6 is a difficult game to class. On the one hand, it does so many things right, and on the other, some things horribly wrong.  The story is split into 4 campaigns, each with their own gameplay and style; Leon S. Kennedy and Helena Harper team up to take on a traditional zombie outbreak, Chris Redfield and Piers Nevans have an all-out war on terror, Jake Muller and Sherry Burkin battle near-invincible bosses, and Ada Wong solves both gameplay and plot puzzles. Leon and Helena's campaign is the best, with a great atmosphere and fun gameplay involving traditional zombies, with Ada's campaign 2nd for it's plot and puzzle elements. Jake and Sherry have the most unique gameplay, due to Jake's Melee ability complimenting Sherry's ranged ability, with QTEs holding it back from being the better. Chris and Piers share the worst of the four, with their campaign being about as cliche and boring as your average military bromance story. They do crossover, both in terms of style, gameplay and story, and they do all contribute to an overarching story, which is convoluted but interesting enough that it held my attention from beginning to end.  Gameplay is were the game really shines and shows it's unique identity. Movement and combat is a smooth, fast and fluid ride for the most part, broken up by the bane of my existence: Quick Time Events. With gameplay as good as it is, I'm simply lost to find any reason why they thought filling their game with these boring, tiresome interactive cinematics. The excellent combat mechanics, which include dodges, rolls, cover and some character specific moves, are more than enough to carry the game. The other stuff on offer, however, is not. Some driving sequences from Chris and Jake's campaigns are more painful than fun, Ada's helicoper level is mostly boring point and click, and some other odd choices make some sections of the campaign more trouble than it's worth. Multiplayer also handles an odd mix; while the basic combat mechanics are great in modes such as Mercenaries, Mercenaries No Hope, Versus and the other modes that handle normal characters play well, others, such as Agent Hunt, which puts you in the role of a zombie in the campaign, controls awful and feels sluggish. Also, don't bother with the gamepad. It works, but barely, and the keyboard has hotkeys which will make your gameplay experience so much better.  The music and audio is all around high quality, with excellent voice acting, great music and fantastic audio cues enhance the gameplay and the story to awesome hieghts. It played exceptionally well on my 5.1 Surround Sound system and was a thrill to blast the sound to it's maximum levels.  Graphics are all around great. The HUD is small and keeps out of the way for the most part, but the itmes menu could have been handled better. The textures are decent aside from some low-res environmental textures, and the lighting is beautiful. Animations, Capcoms strongest point, I think, is fantastic, though some feel like they're too exagerated and overlong. The art design holds up well and is overall a great-looking game.  Story - 7/10 Gameplay - 6/10 Audio - 9/10 Graphics - 8/10 Controls - 8/10  Total - 38/50  The game ran in max graphics, minus the Anti-Aliasing, at 60fps, with the following specs:  Windows 7 64bit Intel i5 750 2.6GHz Nvidia 250GT 1GB 4 GB RAM 1920x1200 Monitor",

            "review_text": "I regret buying this. My initial assessment was that it seemed pretty good. The gameplay quickly degrades however. It seems like this game is trying to emulate games from the COD or Gears of War franchises. This could be ok if it didn't seem like actual gameplay was an afterthought. It's as if they designed these set pieces or scenarios and then thought about how to shovel in gameplay afterward. The first realization of this was in the gun shop scene: WE ARE IN A GUN SHOP WHERE IS THE AMMO?! I'd assume the owner wouldn't be so stingy because it's a zombie apocalypse, but perhaps I assume too much.  Ok, then aftewards Leon and Helena are on a bus where a big fat zombie is holding up the front tires so they can't get away. They have to survive other zombies' attacks, while trying to emtpy enough rounds into the big one's head through the front window. Zombies come into the bus, they melee them, they shoot the bus lifter, rinse, repeat. It takes too long to get enough ammo to do this. I'm ok with making a game challenging via ammo crunch, but this just breaks the tension and gets BORING. Not to mention our big uberbadass Leon has a fatigue gauge where he can't kick a zombie if it runs out. When we're surrounded by very dumb NPCs (who don't shoot the ranged spitter zombies) and trying to survive by doing super badass moves (more on that later) it was very frustrating to have this happen. Game to player: give zombies running bulldogs and sweet roundhouse kicks! Player: Ok sure!! Game: Oh wait we gotta be like all realistic and like the other big blockbuster games, so nm hobble around. Oh also player, you can't keep like a shovel or 2 by 4 these guys try to attack you with to attack them back.. cuz like, we wanna kinda also be like old arcade games. We'll just keep the worst of both worlds to make it frustrating. Player: Damn this kind of sucks I hope the next encounter doesn't suck like this.  So that gets done and it gets to the cathedral. This was like in Wolverine Origin when they get to the island. The game is cruising along, not good, not bad, and then the wheels just fall right off. First off, this church has security statues with laser guided crossbows. I'm assuming it's some kind of facility b/c of what happened next... so why would they have an odd, inneffective security system of this style, instead of some kind of modern sentry turret, or ya know, a locked door. So that part is also really dumb. Then there's the boss fight where a zombie will pick up Leon and tentacle ♥♥♥♥ his face if you press buttons wrong. This was the last straw for me. I get that in games, especially horror games, your character will meet a grisly fate if you mess up. The scene was just so gratuitously revolting. It must have been included solely for a gross out, I guess. Well I don't play games to be grossed out. Again, shouldn't the gameplay be on the forefront of the designer's mind? There was quickly a draught of ammo and melee did completely nothing to this boss while NPCs shot at nothing with their guns that apparently had infinite ammo. Oh wait this boss also spews gas which turns people into zombies but Leon and Helena aren't affected, they can just stab each other in the heart with a syringe and then take herbs like mints and are fine.  So in a comparative summary:  Resident Evil 4 was 90 percent great and 10 percent manure (button mashing sequences and the block sliding puzzle should have been editted out on the re-release)  Resident Evil 5 is a little more on the manure side but that's still far outweighted by the good parts of game, It has button mashing, but during one, the main character punches a boulder out of the way because he's just so damn jacked.  Resident Evil 6 starts off pretty good but quickly becomes a chore, but might appeal to those who value images of homesexual ♥♥♥♥ in a game over decent gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Ok so lets get the Elephant in the room out of the way...  Alot of reviews have said `Well its not Resldent Evil really is it...`. Well that is utter tripe. It is a logical continuation of the RE franchise.Sure it isn't classic Survival Horror but that has been done countless times in the series and things need to move on.   I for one would not want another game stuck with the frankly horrid and awkward controls we have been saddled with since RE:1. People do not rotate on the spot, neither are they incabable of walking and shooting and it's about time that convention died a sad and lonely death.  This is a good game and has plenty of old and new characters meeting across intersecting story lines. So far I have played Ada's campaign and had a blast. There are plenty of secrets to find, icky things to shoot and the odd classic `makes zero sense` puzzle thrown in.  There is a ton of Co-op, Versus and Online action to be had across the various DLC packs and plenty of replay value.   That is the pros out of the way, sadly there are a few cons you should be aware of:  There are more Quicktime events than in the Tomb Raider reboot and that is really saying something. I personally HATE QTE's and just wish programmers would sod off putting them in games already. My percentage scores for Ada's campaign is tragically low due to the amount of times I died because I failed yet another QTE mini `game`. Games are fun, QTE mini games are not.  I can handle dying because I played like an eejit and ran out of Ammo or walked into an obvious Ambush but failing to waggle the joystick, press X at a specific time then hit RT in the right order at the right speed is annoying beyond beleif.  The Controls are way better than previous iterations and being able to run and shoot is a godsend. However there are ALOT of contextual actions and sometimes things go a bit wonky and you end up running into an enemy rather than actually pulling off some awesome takedown.  Other than those negatives this is definitely worth your time and money if you have any love for the RE series in particular or action games in General.",

            "review_text": "So, what can I say about this game? It's a modern Resident Evil title. It took a few good things from Revelations 1, one nice thing from the old titles and a lot of bad stuff from a lot of other Resi titles. But I'm getting ahead of myself. If you want to skip the lengthy part of my review, you can find the pros and cons list below.  First things first: the story. The story is a bit bigger this time around. For one thing, it's because of the fact that it features five campaigns. On the other hand it's because this time the story centers around the fate of the world - AGAIN! Well. But it doesn't feel as insignificant as Revelations 1 since you'll be fighting against a lot of ♥♥♥♥ in the USA, China, Edonia and other places. An organization by the name of Neo Umbrella has risen and is terrorizing the world with... well... bioterrorism. Like in all the other games. But the game looks better than its predessecors. So that's a plus. Anyway. The main character cast centers around Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Sherry Birkin, Ada Wong along with their respective sidekicks. Also there's Albert Wesker's son but I won't spoiler anything. These people are trying to save the day by defeating Neo Umbrella. That's more or less the gist of it.  Fans of the old games will be pleased to hear that you'll be fighting classic zombies from time to time. When you first start the game with Leon you'll be watching limping half-corpses around a city in the USA and when you're in China you'll be seeing them there, too. On enemy variety the devs were pretty creative again. But nothing too new tbh. You got the classic zombies, you got the J'avo. The J'avo are somewhat like the Majini and Ganados, only more extreme and instead of a parasite there's a virus responsible for their mutations. The J'avo have some surprises up their sleeve when it comes to mutations so that's not all too bad. These are the main enemy types. But the bosses are where it's really at. Remember El Gignte? You'll be fighting a couple of those in this game (not like the farce of an El Gigante in RE 5). Then there's a bunch of hulking creatures of plates and muscle with are ♥♥♥♥ing annyoing to defeat because they're bullet sponges. And some other boss battles with a giant, invisible snake, crazy people who thought injecting a dose of the virus into themselves was a good idea (didn't see THAT one coming *chuckles*) and some other ♥♥♥♥ I don't wanna spoiler.  But wherever there's an enemy, there oughtta be a weapon to defeat it, right? Yes! Weapons wise there's a lot. In every campaign you'll be getting different weapons and every character you play as has a different set of starting weapons to begin with. Over the course of each campaign you'll acquire new weapons and you will find a lot of uses for each of them. And yes, there's an elephant killer magnum gun again. But as always, it's ♥♥♥♥ing hard to find any ammo for this thing so hear my advice and use it in boss battles or if absolutely nessecary. Like when you'll be fighting against those chainsaw ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (that are EVEN harder to kill this time around). Aside from that there's a bunch of stationary weapons and some are one time use only.  But the best part about this is: in theory you don't even need weapons most of the time because they finally improved the melee combat. meaning that you can now punch and kick your way through hordes of enemies. Given that they don't shoot you down. Warning: not recommended on harder difficulties because it's generally a dumb idea to only do melee fighting in any Resi game. Well, usually if you have to do that you're bsaically screwed and might as well start over. In this one you can deal considerable damage to your enemies with melee combat. Which is a plus. Also the animation set for melee combat is quite nice to look at.  On the technical side of things the game runs fine on highest setting, no FPS drops, no crashes. Only one time it didn't recognize my save file but that problem was quickly sorted out so fear not, you won't have any technical issues with this one. At least I didn't have any. Game mechanics wise there's a lot of stuff I didn't like and some stuff I was really fond of. As I mentioned earlier, there's half-decent melee combat now, which is a plus. Then you may move while aiming and shooting. First Resi game that brought that one to us was Revelations 1, I believe. Which is a great plus. They finally noticed just how useful this feature is. Knife fighting is no more, you instead screw 'em with your guns in melee combat. Also a good idea. What else? Well, you can walk, run, shoot, hit, die, survive, climb, jump down (a lot of these actions may require you to stand at specific positions however. Resi style) and, when playing with Ada, use your grappling hook. Oh and there's skills now. Like, you collect skill points and after each chapter or so you can buy and upgrade skills with them. The idea's nice but ultimately useless as I didn't use them all that often. Only scenario where I could imagine them being useful would be on the really high difficulties that aren't even fun anymore. Also the partner mechanic is back but it isn't annyoing anymore. Now enemies target your partner too (not like RER) and you almost never have to worry about them dying (unlike RE5). Aside from that it's standard 3rd Person Shooter. Oh, but wait! They are back. More gloriously than ever before. They Q to the T to the E. QTE sections en masse with this game. I mean, I can understand it having a few QTEs in the game. But in Resi 6 they are pretty much used excessively. Not as bad as most of the reception is putting it but it's not like they had any QTEs left after this one. There are a lot of scenes where you just have to smash a few buttons to come forward and avoid death. At least some of the QTEs are creative in the sense that they require you to click at a specific time. But yeah, they're still QTEs.  What else? I got a few gripes with this game QTE wise, yeah. But the worst part is that the credits are unskippable. That wouldn't be so bad if: The credits weren't so long because a trillion people worked on this game and you wouldn't have to watch them five times. Why five times? Well, there are five campaigns and after completing each campaign you are required to watch those unskippable, long-♥♥♥ credits.   And the final piece of information will be the subtle humour in the game which is most prevalent in Jake's campaign because Jake is just the badass guy who doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about most of it and just does his thing along with his audible drek. It's funny, really. Mostly anyway.  So, to wrap this up, pros and cons!  Pros: + Improved graphics + The story isn't too bad (and feels WAY more significant than RER's) + Most of the mechanics in the game are improved + Different animation sets for a lot of enemies (not unlike some OTHER games. Yeah RE5, I'm lookin' at you) + Oldschool zombie slashing action in the first few hours of the game bringing back good memories + Awesome death scenes. Seriously, to die in this game can look pretty cool. There's even an achievement for that + Fairly good melee combat and gunplay + Ludicrous bosses that are even more crazy than before (I like that stuff) + Good enemy variety + NO QTEs IN CUTSCENES + Replayability because you can choose between two characters playing a campaign and each of them is a different approach + And more  Cons! - A thousand QTEs - Unskippable credits - Linear gameplay and story (as always) - Horror? Lol, no - Boring 'puzzles' - You'll die frequently because of some QTEs - I got nothing more honestly  Would I recommend this game? Yeah, it's good for what it does. At 20 bucks? Maybe think about it. If you're a hardcore Resi fan then yes, if you just like 3rd person shooters wait for a sale.",

This is definitely a newer, faster-paced RE even with the clunky controls. There are parts that harken back to the old school actually scary RE games where I'm collecting keys, I'm solving puzzles and it made me sad for that fantastic style is all but extinct these days. Action games are a dime a dozen, but a good horror game is something special. However, I gotta say, there's just something really cool about getting into fist fights with huge mutant monsters. There's always something getting shot, punched, stabbed, burned, blown up or crushed. This game has a lot of 'that was just cool' moments. My favorite was when one of the monsters gets run over by a school bus. There's four separate intertwined campaigns that take over 20 hours to finish the first time. The game is highly replayable. The story was utter nonsense, of course, but it was fun re-playing events from different perspectives. There's also a horde mode where the L4D2 crew are all playable characters.

One thing that really bugs me when I return to RE:6 though, especially when you're playing other RE titles at the same time, is the controls are kinda wonky. It just feels off somehow, like they run a bit too fast or something, really hard to explain. REVELATIONS 2 is running the same engine and pretty much same controls but feels much more refined and tighter. If you play both side-by-side maybe you'll see where I'm getting at. I never really noticed this when I first beat the game on XBOX 360 but now it's really starting to bug me. Surely it's not just me.  Anyways, I think the game is good, not the best RE title by any stretch but it's still an enjoyable COOP game.

            "review_text": "This is from the perspective of someone who has played the Xbox version first, and the PC version second. The Good of this port is the same for the Xbox version, and I will review it as an action game, not a horror game. It is clearly not meant to be scary, but to be fun and make you feel awesome for breaking through all that it can throw at you. If you are unable to accept that Resident Evil is no longer meant to frighten you, you will likely hate this game for straying so far from its roots and reputation for scares. If you are able to look past the reputation of Resident Evil, read on.   The Good: (what to consider when purchasing)  Resident Evil has never had such tight, fluid controls. The new movement and dodge mechanics make you feel like a badass, tucking and sliding out of the way in real time, through your own skill rather than a contextual quick time event as it used to be. Reversal attacks add a layer of cool that no other entry in the series before it has had. You're now able to turn the flow of combat from hectic run-and-gunning into a scene straight out of a kung-fu B movie, rewarding you for your quick reflexes and giving you much needed breathing room when the enemies swarm you. What could be more awesome than grabbing a leaping zombie out of the air and stomping on it before whipping around, kicking another so hard it spins backwards on its heels, then slamming it into the ground with a DDT from behind? Probably while doing it as classic Resident Evil characters, which this game thoughtfully provides.  The gameplay varies between campaigns, as you would expect. Leon's focuses more on melee combat than the rest due to scarce ammunition and the zombies' resistance to bullet damage. Expect to be punished harshly for not getting your reversal timing down, as zombies behave unpredictably; Leaping at random, tripping over their own feet, lunging from the floor to pull you down with them, etc. Chris' campaign is full on testosterone infused action, hardly a dull moment to be found and plenty of fun enemy types to encounter and learn the weaknesses of. J'avo are much more predictable than the zombies, but are able to use ranged weaponry, making combat much more reliant on cover. Ada's campaign is a little more like the Resident Evil we recognize, with more puzzles and being rewarded for avoiding enemy contact, though obviously that's not possible most of the time as this is still an action game. Jake's campaign is a mix of the three, combining the over-the-top melee combat of Leon's campaign, the cover based shooting of Chris' and the enemy avoidance of Ada's. It works well, though can be a bit schitzophrenic as you would be required to change playstyle often.  The game has a wealth of content because of these four campaigns, and if playtime is something you consider when buying a game, you'd get your money's worth here for the sheer amount of it all. It's not Skyrim levels of vast, but for the type of game it was aiming to be, it certainly could have been a lot less. *cough-cough-OperationRaccoonCity-cough*   The Bad: (nitpicks and gripes)  While all that's well and good, there are moments where the camera will suddenly yank away from your perspective and focus on something in the background, but still have combat continue around you. This leaves you helpless as enemies are allowed to swarm in closer, or your precious ammo is wasted as you start shooting at a door that just opened because the game insisted on pulling the camera away to show it to you. Though the gameplay is varied between the campaigns, all of them begin to lose steam half way through. Leon's campaign recycles boss fights to the Nth degree, so much so that you may get frustrated as you have to repeat the same fights over and over with little to no variation between them. Past chapter 3, Chris' campaign just throws more and more enemies at you in the despirate attempt to heighten tension more than it had the previous chapters, though because there's nothing really different from them it just feels like an annoying slog. There is a moment where you take control of a jump jet, but it never happens again and it's over in about five minutes. Jake's campaign remains the freshest the longest, with cheesy car chases and one liners that put a smile on my face, but his final chapter reuses a fair amount elements from Chris' campaign. That's to be expected though, as Chris and Jake are meant to meet here, but they still feel a little too similar at times. Ada's later chapters recycle a lot of the same scenes from the other three chapters with minor tweaks here and there, so you end up feeling as though you're going through the motions, tying loose ends rather than playing as a seperate character.   The Ugly: (the game's major failings)  The PC version's load times and compatibility issues with most computers and hardware make it unquestionably inferior to the console versions upon which the game was built off of. It can take anywhere from 8 minutes to 15 minutes just to reach the main menu even on a good computer, while far more graphically intense games zoom past it, which is completely inexcusable in this day and age. It absolutely cripples this port's lastability by comparison, and though infrequent, the occasional crash will make that 8 - 15 minute wait between startups feel all the more brutal. That the game has been out this long for PC and still has these issues is a shameful neglect of its players who are already wary of this game's reputation for being so unlike any other Resident Evil. There isn't even a chat box to use and communicate with the rare person who joins your game, so if you don't have a mic, you're left with only the character's generic 'thanks!' or 'look out!' commands. It's no wonder the PC multiplayer lobbies of this port are ghost towns when it takes so long to load and your ability to communicate is being harshly limited without such a basic feature. Imagine having no way to explain a monster's weakness while your partner continues to get hurt by it, not noticing what the monster is doing and soaking up resources for it. It would be very frustrating, naturally.   Final Verdict: (CONSOLE version) 7/10  Resident Evil 6 is a very functional, varied game full of cheese that'll give you many hours of brainless fun. If you go into it with the same mindset that you would when approaching a John Woo action movie, you'll have a blast. It's silly, but it seems to be fully aware of that, and just tries to do its own thing.  However, and I cannot stress this enough, play the console versions.  Were it not for the load time, the occasional crash wouldn't be such a big deal and would have remained merely in the Bad, but when combined it makes the experience of playing the PC version not worth the awesome collaboration with Valve's own Left 4 Dead 2 gang and the inclusion of the 250+ enemy minigame, No Mercy mode. Were it not for the lack of a chat box, newbies wouldn't be such an annoyance, but without the ability to explain a bosses weakness or where to go, they simply slow down your game rather than help you in any way that your AI partner couldn't do better than them. It all contributes to the game's lonely multiplayer scene, with more than a third of the game's content going purpetually unplayed (nobody plays Mercenaries, No Mercy, Agent Hunt, or even the other campaigns, just Leon's). It seems unlikely at this stage, but I hope dearly that Capcom fixes the unforgivable startup times, as well as the compatibility issues for many common brands of graphics card. Until then, I recommend Resident Evil 6 as a whole, but not this version of it. There is no excuse for missing basic PC gaming features and 8 - 15 minute load times in the modern era of gaming. Shameful display.",

            "review_text": "I am not a resident evil veteran. I played RE4, revelations 1 and 2 and this one. So this review is a product of these games' experience.  Short version: It is worth its price. I enjoyed the campaing. But the extra modes are not much interesting.  Here are pros:  - The game is optimized considering the mayhem going around during the story :D Game stays at solid 6 all the way. Mabye because i have more powerful GFX than the game requires. - The stories are above average. All 4 stories are pretty long and they internect with each other time to time. It is like witnessing what is going on out of your adventure. - The story is a lot fun with a human coop player. - There is a switch point of view option. I liked it because sometimes the surroundings are forcing you to get a different perspective, from your right shoulder or left. - Anyone can join your campaign as a zombie or a creature if you allow it in the game settings. This makes the game fun. - The stories are pretty linear. This prevents confusions. Considering the coop gameplay mode, getting lost in a big strange environment would be a pain in the neck. - You can have variety of weapons, pistol shotgun rifle bow magnum sniper and also flashbang hand grenade fire grenade (forgot its name :D). All the stories are gibing you at least 4 different weapons throughout the game. - The story mode has puzzles and riddles. They are not much complicated and i think this is a good thing. Otherwise would be frusturation. - The visual quality is not the best but acceptable. Cutscenes are very movie-like. - There are skills to equip in the story mode or extra multiplayer modes. Skill points are earned in the story or multiplayer by collecting relics. And you can purchase skills with these points. There are a lot of skills to purchase. You can change your skill on the fly. Which means if you are in a tight situaiton and surrounded by zombies, you can switch to defensive skills and switch back to offensive skills after slaughtering those bas****rds :D - Even after completing the story mode, you might wanna complete it again with the other player :) It gives a different meaning to the whole story.  Woow lots of pros :) Here are cons:  - Chris and Pierce's story is kind of boring. - Camera movement sometimes causes cheap deaths. - There are lots of button meshing quick time events and the game progression is depending on them. - Online modes (extras) are boring. Agent hunt is the best option (entering another players game as a zombie) but real players are killing you easiliy most of the time. It becomes boring. Mercenary mode has a time limit and you have to kill zombies to buy time. Time limit is totaly ridiculous. One DLC modes seperates players and more zombies pop up in the other player if you make combos efficiently. This is a nice mode but it is frusturating :D One DLC mode makes you zombie and the other player normal person. Briefly, there is not much online content except the story mode. - Level desgn is mediocre. Even a 8 year old can play this game. I think this is a good thing but as a 20 buck game, it should have been a bit more detailed or sophisticated.  Overall, pros are lot heavier than cons. Story is awesome, extra modes are like, meeh, and horror is horrific :D",

            "review_text": "The good stuff:  --- The game offers not one but four campaigns! This is pretty cool considering the 4 couples you have which means 8 characters - each with a different personality, extra attack or weapon and importance when it comes to the storyline. Also, enemies approaching you differ in each campaign. The same goes to the locales. While Leon and Helena traverse through the big city, a cemetery and a cathedral offing dozens of zombies Chris and Piers do the same but in China. They are attacked by J'avos - these are infected people with the ability to plan their attacks and can also use firearms.  --- Graphics / cutscenes / sound effects -&gt; production value. Well, after episode 5 it was obvious the creators would take this to another level. The game looks stunning and the atmosphere is there. The coop and action sequences once again decrease the horror elements but nobody can say they did not try! Also, there are dozens of cutscenes and in the game's menu you can rewatch all. Altogether I'm sure it will take at least 2 hours to go these in one sitting.  --- Longevity. Once again we have collectibles that come in the form of emblems. I have found many but could not find a lot either. There are no more treasures as collectibles. Instead, there is something else that is dropped by the enemies and they represents points. This amount can be used to purchase skills. These can then be levelled up. 3 skills can be active at a time and there are enemy-specific ones, too. So, you and your coop partner need to work together and decide who equips what. Multiplayer also returns in the form of Mercenaries and there is now a new game mode called Agent Hunt.  The bad stuff:  --- 4 campaigns: In terms of story and characters this is really good but there are too many intersections. In fact, there are boss battles you need to play twice. Really? Of all this it is Ada's (4th) campaign that is the worst. First of all, almost all the areas are familiar and you encounter hardly any new enemies. Throughout all the campaign you know what's going to happen and the ending is a total letdown. Not only this but Ada plays alone. Your friend assumes the role of a so-called Agent - a guy who's just there so that the creators can tell they did really make a coop game. Agent wears a mask and does not have a real name. In the cutscenes you see Ada alone and throughout the campaign Agent cannot interact with anything. You cannot open doors or chests, you cannot solve any puzzles and no QTEs for you (which is actually good). You can pick up bullets, of course and fight with Ada but feel like an unnecessary character who does not even have a story.  --- Cheesiness: If you thought episodes 5's dialogue was bad you are in for a great surprise. Some of the conversations the protagonists have are just dumb. In fact, you can easily guess what will happen next. The script should have been reworked at least 3 times to eliminate some of the worst dialogues this franchise has ever seen.  --- Boss battles: They are waaaaaaaay toooooooooo loooooooooooooong! You battle the same guy while he assumes at least 3 different forms one after the other. The tactic is different as well as the environment. It is not necessarily a problem but the game is very difficult and also you are 100% sure you eliminated your foe when he returns once more to annoy you. I have to admit the enemies are great (each one of them poses a real threat) but you battle them for too long. This gets boring and aggravating considering the difficulty of the game.  --- Difficulty level: This game is annoyingly difficult. From time to time you get a QTE which is next to impossible to complete for the first time. Missing it will result in a death cutscene - well, I appreciate the developers wanted to show me what cutscenes they had conjured up in their mind but this is still pretty annoying. Boss battles can be a pain and the controls do not help either. It is a sad thing to say since this game enables you to do pretty much everything: you can run, do fistfight, dodge and even slide. And finally: you can walk while aiming at an enemy! The problem is with the turning and the speed. Also, the camera does not help and sometimes you get attacked because our heroes are looking at what's going on elsewhere in the distance.",

The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics, SFX and overall content is great. Now as for the story line absolutely bonkers of a plotline, I mean gee whiz is it goofy. You play through several different campaigns of familiar characters as they all interconnect with eachother through the story which gives you wicked cases of Deja Vu. I am not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding its straight vertigo from start to finish. Now for the rest of the game...LoL #OMG where do I begin.  The actual control scheme, camera fixtures and control reactions to this game is gawd awful. The charatcers are so rushed and unfleshed out it's like I am in Die Hard with zombies. The times though that we played through in co-op was just hilarious because of the amount of silliness surrounding this entire game. This game is laid with so much QTE (Quick Time Events) you would immediately just rage or laugh your ♥♥♥ off to how much you will die or repeat from this throughout the campaigns in such ridiculous ways. I mean its a joke because the enemies will be so overwhelming and at times endless that you will be getting thrown around like a ragdoll and knocked down constantly, not to mention the bullet sponging (I freaking hate the screamers!) constantly throughout the game with the most irky jerky over the shoulder camera work ever. The cover system is so bipolar, and so are the enemies when you fight them on higher difficulties. The game is that hilarious. For the most part the Co-op is where its at for the most parts, lots of cool modes that are fun if are drunk, high or just looking for a good laugh to play together to have fun because if you are able to not take this game seriously you will find it funny or entertaining.   As for the horror factor? Well hate to break it to you all but... IT DOES NOT EXIST HERE.   The game has no horror elements, it feels like an action movie with zombies with one of the most outlandish story plots I still can't wrap my head around by the choices, cliche villians and just trying to understand where this is all going after the events of Re 4 &amp; 5 which were excellent games. Its like I just watched a shoot'em up flick make love to a zombie...it is that bad. But past that when it's all said and done it is why I still recommend this game because it is still a good title because it completely parodies it's own mythology that you will have fun playing just from the sheer idiocy of everything you witness and play through on screen. Like a popcorn flick that you control. And when you encounter the fight with the nipple monster for the first time you know you can't take this game seriously anymore. I mean ♥♥♥♥, what were they thinking!?   Game is worth a laugh and a playthrough. Just only advice is don't buy it full price, get it on sale.",

The graphics are mediocre, primarily from low texture quality and repetitive use of objects, textures and the like. Elements in many levels just feel all the same, with just the geometry changing. Some areas look visually impressive, but it's rare and short-lived. The controls and camera are ridiculous at times, but that's always how the Resident Evil franchise has been. Luckily, there are a lot of custom deaths when you fail quick time events, and they never get old.  The level of quality varies GREATLY throughout the game... the beginning of Leon's campaign is just awful, stereotypical, and poorly executed. It gets better later on, though. Jake's campaign felt more consistent and solid, while also being less over-the-top.  Despite all the bad, the game is actually fun COOPERATIVELY.

Trying to run with a keyboard during a chase will drive you insane, especially with all the ridiculous fixed camera changes. Seriously, I'm still trying to finish Chris's campaign, that last chase is absurd! And without checkpoints!   Quick time events were the main cause of my deaths. Which is a shame, because when you're going around killing zombies or whatever it get's pretty fun. But before you know it, you're thrust into one those obligatory race, underwater(really?), chase sequences, quick button smashing that all games seem to have nowadays and then everything goes to hell.   The combat gameplay is good, it feels great to be able to take down a zombie with your hands. Every character feels different, the dodging mechanic works (once you get the hang of it) and the weapons, while not the best, definitely doesn't detract from the game.   The story is... fine. Your usual bag of cliches. Although it succeeds in creating a frenetic apocalyptic atmosphere.The characters are great for the most part (though I wish there was a bit more of race and gender diversity). It was nice seeing Leon and Sherry again. But can someone explain to me why the hell does Leon have feelings for Ada? They were together for like, 2 hours, in RE2! Ugh! All his scenes where they mentioned this were groan worthy.   The atmosphere is really where the game succeeds Especially in Chris and Jake's campaign, the set pieces looked great, from Europe to China, they all had a distinctive feel. Unfortunately, the first half of Leon's was really out of pace. They tried to bring the survival horror aspect back, but it doesn't work anymore, not with the frantic combat style of the game.  Overall I'm disappointed. This game could have been great, but it fails in its execution.",

I still do so.  It's true however that the game is more action than survival horror. And online matching system is really bad. A friend and I tried intersection with each other, we both in the same city. However gave up after a few attempts. This also affects mods, you can't play anyone other than mercenaries and sometimes survivor.   Overall, pros: fantastic visuals, very long story playtime, story intersecitons, great player control cons: bad online matching system, more action than horror. ",

My opinion is i have no problem with evolution of game, but RE6 was dissapointment for me because of story: So Epic, So Cinematic, So Unrealistic, dont mentioning plotholes themselves. In old games player was scared with character...but here, every character behaving as a boss with no fear.

Graphic is very nice (Chris face gesturing), control on keyboard is little bit problem for start, take some time to understand it (crawling under blades for exp.).

RE:6 is a pretty damn good game despite the hate some people give it. If one has to say it isn't a resident evil game anymore; I would say that the series really hasn't been 'Resident Evil' since code veronica or the first 3. It kind of got the hitman absolution treatment. Also going back to the city is wonderful since RE has been on this rural muddy/washed out colored binge for a couple games. They finally made a dark game again.. The addition of other game modes and mercenaries is also pretty awesome.   It remains linear though like 4-revelations which is my small nitpick since I love to splore in games.  The only thing that bums me out is the (so-far) lack of weapon upgrade parts. The QTE's are actually pretty nice and short compared to other games where you can be asked to spam a key super fast for 30 sec.  I would easily give this an 7.5 to 8/10 if asked but to me I am fully satisfied and would really only want more re6. :P   More info:  I have been a fan of the RE series since playing/owning the first three at release on the ps1. I stepped away after code veronica and never cared to return since what I saw of four looked way too different from the RE games I knew and loved.   Only recently I have gotten into the later games 4,5, revelations and now six.  I would argue that they finally got rid of all the clunky mechanics that were only around because of the controllers and limits back then. While I love the old ones the best this one feels top notch gameplay wise out of the recent titles.  For instance the pause and shoot was from 1-veronica since you could not free aim and had to tap on the up down to shoot high or low. They kept it in 5 to be a throwback and somehow make it hard or something.   In Resident Evil 6 you can finally dodge and melee proper, though it will tire you and have a short cd. (non-spammy). The gun play feels good and the sound effects are really nice. Being able to roll out of the way or land on your back to shoot from the floor is a great touch. Graphically the game is beautiful and benefits greatly from Sweetfx.   In my opinion RE6 feels like what 4-revelations should have been controls wise. Those clung on to old mechanics to make you think they were staying true to the old play style. In 6 they shed all that, made the mechanics/controls more fluid/responsive and finally let it be a decent TPS instead of a slow clunky one.  This title takes you back to the city and the shambler type zombies come with that. You will find that sometimes it is better to run than it is to keep fighting. I wish we could have RE 1-veronica playstyle back but since that is gone, six is a good entry to the series.",

If you enjoy RE 0-4 (maybe even 5) and CV keep your money...",

It was a very atmospheric game with high difficulty level. I never forgot about Resident Evil because of in my view the special and nice graphics. Now, many games and years later I picked up Resident Evil 4. I finished the game in a heartbeat, played it for a second, third time, loved the typical inventory for guns and items. Japanese horror rules. Now. Raccoon City and Biohazard 6 are my last buys. I think they are both in their way special and very good games. One game developper has too evolve, a game (even called resident evil) has too Grow, change. I never made an issue about one game being different from the other. Because; the graphics were pretty darn good! Resident Evil, as the game is called is.. a studio, full of competent people, a piece of art. They have a website like no other game has. U can unlock sketches drawn for the game characters etc.  Not too mention the Animated Movies they made about resident Evil. This is HIGH resolution cartoons like never before. I don't know what hobby's you have sir. But next to gaming, sports, music.. art is alsoo a hobby of mine.  Why I tell all this. Well if have to say I'm dissapointed. I finished the campaign in single player. Then I started playing the campain in CO-OP.  I'm sorry too say, but you call this Playing a game together people? I'ts been two years now, and the only serious co-op players I met were asian players. Japanese, chinese I dont know but not american or European. Maybe because they have more respect for the game? They have knowledge of the roots. Or they simply know what the word 'Respect means.  I've seen like everything in CO-OP; intollerance, team-killing, not helping each other one out... Worst thing is; abusing the game and its possebilities too kill your teammate. So you think you're a fierce person or a good player? by using this game not for what its made?  Resident Evil is not EVIL, maybe you missed someting but this game is not a horror movie and you are Not one if its characters!! It's just a title; Resident Evil has spooky and challenging opponents but they are not Evil !! At least; you don't have a clue what evil is. If you are bored go download the last horror movie like 'I know what you did last summer' and watch it 10 times, then go tell your friends how COOL you are.  As a tip for the tolerant and honest and good players; teamkillers and Quitters stare and do absolutely nothing, taking no first actions, sneak up behind your back.. or they run all over the place so you cant keep up.  I can't remember where the hype 'I need too have a cool and scary nickname' came from.. or ' I need too quit the game within 15 minutes because you shot the zombie that I wanted 2 shoot........ I'ts not cool people and because of this and maybe because of some negative reviews written about this game, players and developpers may become unmotivated.  I tend too host a game myself now, play the game for what its made for.  And finish it with 85% accuracy and lots of S-grades. Please; have respect for this game, the developpers and the gamers. I'd like too even finish with saying; from now on ; every teamkiller that screws me over in co-up, mutiplayer etc ; I have your nickname and info written down. I'm gonna file a complaint. And if you think the company has no power in doing so, I'll make it happen watch me.       ",

The story itself is typical action/horror movie fanfare with four perspectives; Leon &amp; Helena, Jake &amp; Sherry, Chris &amp; Piers, and Ada, which follow the respective tones: 'Horror' filled with references to the more traditional, almost survival horror games, Pursuit 'horror', being perpetually chased and harassed, Some ♥♥♥♥ed kind of mish-mash of emulating modern cover shooters and RE5, And actually feeling similar to traditional RE games. Overall a satisfying greasy fast food burger of a story, if you go in not expecting much, you'll be happy.   There is some redemption in the gameplay and consequently The Mercenaries mode. The gameplay is less horror and more action themed in general, with dodge moves, invincibility frames, quickened reloading, and a perk system to choose upgrades from. Melee combat has been refined and advanced, making things like a run through mercenaries without firing a bullet very possible. The character selection is also comparable to that of RE5, with an added cameo of the cast from L4D2. Yup. Your friends can call you Coach here, too.   Overall, not bad. Get it on the cheap.",

This is the first game where you can freely, or almost anyway, dive, duck, and destroy your way through zombies. The story consists of 4 different plot lines that are inevitably tied together. This is done in a great manner and brings a solid understanding to the game as a whole. The low point of this game is the lack of customization. Many people love the fact that you can upgrade weapons and can choose from only one in a certain group; e.g. a 45 Colt vs a 'Dirty Harry' type gun from the magnum collections; however, you are given only one type of magnum and you cannot upgrade it. I believe the developers were going for a newer feel for this game and getting rid of the weapons case fro past RE games but customization is integral to bringing something meaningful and unique to each player.  They do however make up for the lack of customization, on the weapons side, by allowing you to pick your own badge (dogtag) for online pursuits. You can choose from a wide array of styles and can even choose a title and logo to go with it! This does help in some manner but if you're using the same exact weapons as everyone else and want to show off how you can complete the game with only a minimum level of handgun... well that's not an option :x.",

            "review_text": "Zombies, abominations, and rampant viruses. Many games have touched on those keywords, but CAPCOM's Resident Evil series has set the table for the zombie-killing survival horror genre. Since the first game, the series has strived to capture the struggle of surviving in zombie-infested mansions, cities, and laboratories with nothing but your wits and whatever weapon you manage to get your hands on. With an evil pharmaceutical company's creations running amok, it falls upon you to uncover their secrets and get out alive. Over time, the borders of the series have shifted and parted to suit the changing times, but as I've noted with Resident Evil 6, the newest addition to the series, the core has remained the same.  Resident Evil 6 is the creation of fusing the fourth and fifth game together while keeping aesthetics of the first three games scattered about in select scenarios like trudging through a dying, infested city or escaping from a seemingly invincible foe. Taking place a few years after the events of the previous game, the world is on the brink of another bioterrorism catastrophe, and it's up to a handful of distinguished individuals to put a stop to it, all the while bringing the masterminds to justice. Returning to the fight are four original fan favorites: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Sherry Birkin, who is a grown woman at this time and Jake Muller's partner, and Ada Wong, who stars in her own campaign as she did in RE4's Separate Ways campaign. All characters are joined by new partners to assist them in their campaigns, of which are four divided into five chapters each.  A few words of warning: the main game's campaign is much longer than 4 and 5's story. Each chapter can take up to an average of an hour and a half of your time, and a campaign can take up about half of your day, even if you're the speedrunner type. It's a good thing that the campaigns are varied, else those hours spent would be unbearable.   Leon's campaign is a callback to the days of Resident Evil 2. Although Leon is joined by Helena Harper, a regretful woman armed two powerful weapons, there is no safety in this. The campaign guides the player through many dark and eerie locations that keep them tense and alert, and the zombies faced by Leon and Helena are soupped up to match the times and advanced controls. It can be easy to be caught off guard and overwhelmed by the varieties of zombies, but they can be quickly dispatched with a calm mind and a quick trigger finger. For those wanting survival horror, Leon's chapter delivers.  That said, the opening sequence can leave the player baffled at the abruptness of the situation. The President is a zombie, the surrounding city is infected, and a cathedral owned by the big bad villain is supposed to hold all the answers. On top of that, the guilty Helena Harper is tight-lipped and doesn't explain herself to Leon until the end of the second chapter. On multiple occasions the agent asks for exposition or reasons to which Helena waves her hand, choosing to jeopardize what little trust there is between each other for the sake of theatrical deliverance at the right moment.  And let's not forget to mention Simmons, the villain whom the players must fight four times before he finally dies. Granted, the boss fights take place in spectacular arenas and there's enough ammunition to force the next sequence, but the sheer tenacity of the villain weighing against the exasperation of both the players and the characters themselves leaves a bad taste. If Leon's campaign was a filling dinner, the ending with Simmons was a sour tart that took too long to finish.  Chris's campaign is more of what RE5 offered, that being survival action rather than survival horror. With the army of BSAA troops at Chris's back and Piers Nivans, a talented sniper, at his side, the campaign transitions into a third-person shooter play style where cover is much more important, especially against enemies who use firearms. There are no zombies for the Arklay Mansion survivor to fight. Instead there are the J'avo, which are humanoid enemies like the Ganado and Majini from the previous games. The difference with the J'avo is that they are able to mutate body parts in response to getting shot, which can result in a variety of enemy types that force the player to change tactics.  CAPCOM had tried to appeal to the Call of Duty fans with the Chris campaign, but in doing so they lost some appeal to the fans of the RE series. The campaign focuses too much on action and throws enemy after enemy at you without giving the ammunition or health needed to tackle them at times. Another gripe with the campaign is the final level and its overuse of the camera. Typically the camera would be over the shoulder of the player, but in the final sequence the camera is unreliable as it focuses on a large BOW that players have no hope of destroying at the moment. To make matters worse, the controls follow the camera just as well as they did when the cameras changed in the first few games. This makes running from a foe or looking where you're going an unsavory challenge.  Jake's campaign is hands-down the most varied of them all. Players are taken for a rollercoaster ride through urban warzones, avalanche-prone mountains, a deadly manor, burning streets and even an undersea research facility. The enemies are the J'avo and BOWs again, but while the player can dispatch them with ease, a new foe inspired by RE3's Nemesis chases the characters through all missions. Layered between the various fight and flight elements is the personality of the campaign's two characters, Jake and Sherry. They're personable enough for players to relate to and they're interesting and determined enough that one can't help but root for them. Not to mention the awkward yet adorable scenes between them... Other than a few unforgiving parts in the levels (snipers on an icy slope, for instance), Jake's campaign is exciting, rousing, and a hell of a lot of fun.  And as per usual, Ada's campaign sets out to provide exposition and tie up loose ends left dangling during the three main campaigns. Her gameplay has many stealth elements, staying true to her character playing games behind the scenes. As she encounters all of the main characters in their campaigns, she also fights the various enemies in each campaign: zombies, J'avo, and BOWs. Beaten only by Jake's campaign, Ada's run is filled with variety and backstory, although trying to decipher a story by CAPCOM is a Herculean effort in itself.  Yes, like most CAPCOM games the story is lacking. Here's a brief summary: It's a one-sided love story that results in a mad clone of Ada, the death of the President, and a Chinese Raccoon City. Given that the series loves to make its characters remark that every city with zombies reminds them of Raccoon, maybe CAPCOM just has a bad case of nostalgia that most fans have gotten over by now.  RE6's controls are a far cry from the tank mechanics of the first few games. The heroes can perform mad dashes, move while aiming, physically attack on whim, and dodge attacks by rolling, ducking, and sliding with minimal effort. Adding to the formula is a new mechanic that allows you to counter an enemy's attack with one of your own, provided you have the reflexes to execute the counter. Cover, which was used in some places in RE4 and 5, can be taken anywhere. By pressing the aim button near a wall or object, a character can snap to the cover and peek out to shoot at hostiles. It's a gimmicky mechanic that needs more refinement, but other than that, the new controls are easy to get a hold of.  If you're not griping about the story, then you must be having difficulty with the camera. In short, not bad, but not the best that CAPCOM has created. If you're going to try RE6 out, I'd recommend renting it before making the decision to buy it.",

            "review_text": "Score: 5/10  Be sure to stock up on canned food, weapons, medical supplies and gasoline as Resident Evil 6 satisfies the un-dead gamer horde but leaves more to be desired by the living.  It’s 15 Years after the Arklay Mansion incident and the biggest project in Capcom’s history, Resident Evil 6, looks to carry on the elements of what began as a horror series. But instead it just proves that bigger isn’t always better. Despite delivering a game with four campaigns and loads of online features,Resident Evil 6 lacks the means to either scare you or impress you.  At times it embraces its old school heritage, pitting its heroes against the un-dead horde, horrific creatures and rather farfetched –who-put-this-here-puzzles. The game is incredibly dark, tension is rife and yet it simultaneously tries to be the largest, most action packed entry in the history of the franchise. Every facet of Resident Evil 6 leans towards a western-style cinematic. Lengthy fire fights, driving sequences, falling sequences, crash sequences – I refer here to a particular incident involving a helicopter, bullet train and skyscraper – all of which result in something that is erratic and never sure of itself, delivering brilliance one moment and something far less spectacular the next. In short,Resident Evil 6 is begging to be a movie.  Capcom promised bigger and we got bigger, although it may have exaggerated to the degree in which the four individual campaigns differed. Each campaign is seven to eight hours long and on top of that there is the familiar Mercenaries and new Agent Hunt Mode. In Agent Hunt, players are able to drop-in and out of online games, as either a zombie or other C-virus abomination – similar to that of Left 4 Dead-, in an attempt to hinder the progress of other players and ultimately force them to give it up, turn it off and go to bed, which is great fun until somebody does it to you.  Rather than infuse characters and storylines along a singular campaign, the game separates them across four individual threads. This layered narrative, whilst new to the franchise, sometimes works against the game play. As the campaigns cross paths, the game forces players to replay sequences – some of which really ought to be played once- nothing is gained from this repetition, as plot revelations only come from cut scenes/ dialogue and not in-game action.  Quick-time events are prominent to the point of distraction. The new cover-system is disappointing and really isn’t necessary at all –the only time I ever found myself using it was during the inane and equally pointless tutorial- and the skills mechanic is mundane. Not only are you limited to the most basic of upgrades but the game only allows you to equip up to three at once and rightly so because you won’t want to spend your points on more than three anyway.  Resident Evil 6 offers vast improvements in terms of the cooperative game-play experience both on and offline. Resident Evil 5 was notorious for its empty-headed AI partner system but this time around, should you wish to play on your own, seek comfort in that the AI does a great job of knowing what to do and where to go, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources. When playing with a friend, the game capitalises on some great ideas but struggles with the execution. Often you find yourself standing around with nothing to do, whilst your buddy works his way through a handful of enemies until they’re able to open a door or lower a ladder.  Visually,Resident Evil 6 focuses on shadows and much darker, murky environments as opposed to Resident Evil 5’s sun-soaked African locales. The result is a Resident Evil experience players will be familiar with but the overall aesthetics leave you wondering why Capcom didn’t realise it sooner. The Unreal Engine 3 does little justice to Capcom’s flagship title and to be honest, there are a lot better looking games out there. Not to take anything away from Resident Evil 6, it’s just too similar to its predecessor to take any real preference.  For most fans, the love of the franchise began with the first time you found a zombie crouched over Kenneth’s corpse in the Arklay mansion. Or the moment the Cerberus –zombie dogs- crashed through the windows. These are the signature moments that we remember. The love of the old Resident Evil came from these moments, these self-contained incidents of horror. But Resident Evil 6 does everything it can to abolish this trend. In a reversal of roles,Resident Evil 6 looks like it draws from its western blockbuster counterparts, Paul Anderson’s over-the-top action thrillers, rather than focusing on the fundamentals that made it great and led to the movies to begin with.  Under any other name, Resident Evil 6 could be great. Breathe fresh air into a stifling and dull genre. Sadly, it just isn’t Resident Evil.",

I am a big fan of the series and i try to play most of the games aside from the handheld ones but that is mostly a control issue than anything. This resident evil got a lot of flack, and supprisingly more than resident evil 5. re6 still isnt the survival horror game that resident evil fans want, however the game is in a slight step in the right direction. Well if your playing either the ada or leon campain. The Chris and Jake campains are more like action games. I did enjoy most of all the campains. there were some sections in the game however that felt like they were near impossible. One section in Chris's campain has you running away from a attack helicopter while jumping from platform to platform and dodging enemies. If you are just one second too slow you will either get shot by a missile or dodge the missile and fall through the map and die. I can not express my frustration with the 25 tries that it took me to get past that part thanks to dodgey game mechanics and controlls. And if you run out of ammo durring the final boss of Chris's campain be prepared for a 45 minute fight as it spawns things that have a chance to drop ammo or skill points. And if you have my luck have fun stabbing the boss to death. I did have a lot of skill points by the end of that playthrough. Even with these flaws the game still had me playing it for quite a while actualy. to finish all the playthroughs it took me around 20 hours. I did explore quite a bit however so some might be able to finish it quicker. If you can catch it durring a sale it is worth a try.",

Here's some examples. Before you even start playing you encounter some stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the 6 that you use to calibrate the brightness settings. You are told to make it so it's barely visible... It's extremely easy to see, I can see it even on the minimum brightness settings but after actually playing the game I changed the brightness to almost maximum because I couldn't see a damn thing anywhere ever. A corpse can be lying there on the ground, you shoot it in the head and nothing happens, but if you try to walk over it, it attacks you because surprise! it's a zombie. Now that it has attacked you, you can shoot it. WTF Another good example of utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is in the 'sewers' where you end up on the train tracks somehow and a train comes. You can stand at the side of the tracks, but then the train comes and it plays a scene with you getting hit by the train in the very center of the tracks, even though the train was nowhere near you. Eventually I figured out that you need to press the space+r that flashes on the screen half a second before the train comes, because you know, you can't press it sooner than that. Then once pas the train, there's more zombies wandering the tracks! like if I can't even dodge the train, how can the zombies? Your ally, if computer controlled, is computationally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. in the first 10 minutes of playing I must have been shot in the back 20 times. The serpent stones that are scattered throughout the game are not described to you in any way, they are just sorta there. I missed one because I didn't know what to do with it, I tried to pick it up but couldn't, turns out you need to shoot it, as if I was supposed to know that.  The game is also painfully unrealistic. Like, there is ammo EVERYWHERE. Absolutely everywhere. I would much rather zombies be killable with a single head shot and have there be almost no ammo instead. Force you to use fist fighting, and like, melee weapons which also don't seem to be a thing from what I can tell. Or another good example, getting bitten in the shoulder by zombies but being completely fine, uninfected. Or when you flip the cop car and it EXPLODES. as if cars explode when flipped. Or when the chandelier falls and CATCHES FIRE FOR NO REASON. Who made this game, micheal bay?",

It's too the point where I just want to enjoy a cutscene and open a door without having to work for it. It doesn't add to difficulty or fun, it's just irritating. If you don't have good reflexes, you'll die A LOT. The additions to combat are interesting but feels a bit clunky. I like that you can melee and counter enemy attacks. They've also added the ability to dodge. It can be a bit overwhelming when you first start playing. The controls aren't very intuitive. I like where they're going with combat but they may need to simplify it a little. With all the new additions, it ends up feeling messy. That being said, the combat is probably my favorite part of the game. Which is why I enjoy Mercenaries mode the most. The difficulty is iffy. There are times when I might write it off as lack of familiarity or I'm just clumsy. But there are also times when it just feels like the game expects you to die over and over just to learn the game. Dying over and over to learn the mechanics gets frustrating. The game ends up feeling unrewarding and rather than progessing you feel like you're regressing.  The story makes as much sense as the films. But I do enjoy the characters. If there was one redeeming feature, it would be the graphics. The detail in character faces and models are really lovely.  So tl;dr: This game isn't that great. But if you enjoy shooting and kicking a zombie in the face, this game might be passable. ",

Resident Evil 6 was a major change in pace compared to other installments. The gameplay is more fast paced than in other games. The story to this one is also rather different than others as well.   When getting down and dirty, this Resident Evil feels more like a shooter than a horror survival. You're running and gunning for the most part. Sure there are a few jump scares here and there however, you just don't get that same feel from this one. I understand it was done in Resident Evil 4 and 5 however in this one, the zombies shooting at you becomes a little out of place and abnoxious. The AI in that is better than that of what should be in an actual shooter. If you're coming to RE6 to fill the missing void skip this one and go to Revalations.  As for the controls and other mechanics of this game, everything is mapped terribly. You'll need to hold Shift and P at one point to avoid a train. The new inventory is fairly difficult to use in a rush and nothing is really explained to you, you're thrown right into the story. Hopefully you won't have to leave to take a dump as you can't pause at all either.   Mercenaries makes a return and this is where the fast paced mechanics of this installment shine. With the 'No Mercy' edition added to this installment, there are hordes and hordes of zombies making the fast paced gameplay exteremely enjoyable. Also just the fact that there's a crossover between this world and Left 4 Dead is outstanding.   Being that I did not feel the same vibe I have from other installments, this RE will be getting a negative review from me. However that just me, I like the emersed stories they usually have and enjoy the twists and turns. If you like games like Assassin's Creed, Mirror's Edge, and Splinter Cell Conviction, the gameplay feels a little similar.",

Leon's campaign has its good (very few) moments when you actually feel you could probably be playing a weird Resident Evil game (but a Resident Evil nonetheless) but other then those few moments it really feels like an awful game. It gets boring very soon and I can't even think of playing it alone (The Kingdom of Boredom). Characters once again feels like are action movie heroes capable of superhuman things and you can almost predict everything that's going to happen (gives you no surprise nor excitement to keep playing). Altough I actually prefer this over Resident Evil 5 (but realize that is like preferring handling manure over pee) I still can't recommend this... Capcom has to realize they have to take a step back and track its roots to make a good Resident Evil game as they once did. You want to play this game in coop with a friend regardless of what it is supposed to be? You'll share some laughs and you're probably going to have fun.

I don't think a game has ever made me so spiteful with its design decisions.  All menus (including saves) work in real time. There is no pause. There is no remit from this unending nightmare. The inventory is clunky garbage. Progress is only truly saved at the end of chapters (about four to a campaign, and about two hours long each.)  Furthermore, the game is in over-the-shoulder cover-shooter controls most of the time. And then unexpectedly it's in tank controls. And then sometimes the camera decides to decouple from your shoulder, orbits around you, and reverses all your movement inputs while it's doing this. Not as a bug, mind you. As a feature.  I don't think I can adequately describe how awful this is, so instead just imagine Capcom's boot stomping on a human face forever.  EDIT: Died a few more times. Figured out a workaround for the problem. The game gets very confused (bless its little heart) when you try to maneuver while running with the arrow keys. You need to frantically wrench the mouse around the screen to try and head in the right direction. The arrow keys are also necessary, but they fulfill a supplementary role: namely, navigating you into walls.",

But far be it from me not to give credit where credit is due; Resident Evil 6 gives you /a lot/ of content. Its first campaign is probably as long as the whole of Resident Evil 5's campaign, and you get three more campaigns in addition to that (in fairness, the next three storylines are shorter than the first, but it still an impressive amount). I also enjoyed the characterization of the various protagonists; you are introduced to each of them in a preceding campaign where they come off as one-dimensional, but when you actually follow their stories you realize there is some depth to them. The four campaigns intertwine in an interesting way, although each has its own unique set of levels that only briefly intersect at certain points. Lacking in any eye-catching set-pieces, the maps themselves are well-detailed (although the texture work could use some improvement), with good variety in design, albeit as off-the-wall unrealistic as I've come to expect most Capcom (and indeed, Japanese) games. Resident Evil 6 also boasts an impressive variety of weapons and monsters.  But while the above makes for an impressive list, the game fails in its actual gameplay. Its various campaigns offer some variety - the first is a pretty standard survival-horror in the vein of Dead Space or RE5, the second is more focuses on the shooting, the third campaign requires you to focus on your character's mobility more and the third has strong stealth elements - they all suffer from one common flaw: a huge over-reliance on quick-time events. You can't cross a room without encountering at least one QTE. They aren't even particularly good quick-time events; they are either incredibly easy (and thus pointless interruptions) or of the sort you can only master by dying first because the game doesn't give you any time to see what button needs be pressed before killing you. The developers also delighted in over-using the tired mechanic of having you run towards the camera while something deadly chases you from behind, complete with shifting camera angles (and controls) just to make things even less fun. None of these segments are difficult, and none of them are fun. The rest of the game is fairly standard shooting, albeit with monsters that tend to be a bit too resilient and with annoying multi-stage 'puzzle bosses' (complete with the dull-as-dishwater glowing-orange vulnerabilities mechanic that should have been put out to pasture in the Playstation era). And the less said about the ridiculous storyline and characters the better; computer games may never win awards for best writing but why is it that Capcom games always seem to pull from the bottom of the barrel?  All in all, I found the technical aspects impressive but while actually playing it I frequently found myself muttering 'I hate this game' when it forced an awful camera angle on me, or for its sluggish controls, or when it dumped me into another dull quick-time event, or even when it made me endure FOUR unskippable end-credit sequences. For all its modern amenities, overall Resident Evil felt mechanically archaic, like its developers were still stuck in the SNES era and hadn't noticed that gameplay had evolved significantly over the past 30 years. Barring the over-reliance on QTEs, I might have begrudgingly given this game a recommendation, at least for fans of the franchise; it's colorful and incoherent return to the series' strengths. But the over-reliance on quick-time-events so ruined the experience that I cannot do otherwise than to warn players away from the game.",

Capcom Certainly Dropped and Egg with this, and I don't mean as a RE Title, forget about that and it is still a bad game, they tried to do something new and it simply didn't work. Despite the controversy and slating this got upon release when I saw it in the Summer sale for Six Bucks it was out of sheer morbid curiosity that I bought it. The Portmanteau twist was something that I found interesting and if it had been done properly then it would have been amazing, but from what I understand Capcom blew the budget for this on Corperate Suits, Advisors and other assorted Professional Butt-Kissers who know nothing about actual Games or the fans that buy them. Also while playing this the inconsistency of the graphics and a few other things gave me the sneeking impresion that corners had been cut and this had been rushed through so I did a little Due Dilligence which I found interesting.  By far the largest RE game to date is the complete Revelations 2 with a Whopping Big 18 GB. Coming second (surprisingly) is the HD Remaster of the Gamecube Remake at 17 GB. However RE 6 comes Third at 16 GB, and that's after CAPCOM added more content because of the complaints, so it would indeed seem that something had definately gone wrong in the production of this. Let's face it these days most Independent Small Producers make product that hits around the 16 GB mark, but a Mega Companly such as CAPCOM can't produce better than this?!?! Ultimately Capcom's clear distain of the fans is what wrecked a game that COULD have been a convincing Comeback for Resident Evil. First of all if you made it past the epic Train Wreck of an Intro Level without uninstalling it, either out of sheer frustration or because you genuinely thought it was broken, then well done because many have fallen here! Ok that over and done with perhaps we can enjoy the actual game? Nope, the PC version is still a complete stinker.....and I get the creepy, unshakable feeling that the Suits at Capcom were trying to punish us for not liking the change of direction they started in RE4 as I have not come across a game that does so much to deliberately sabotage itself since The Fabulous Wanda. These awful game Mechanics don't happen by accident, someone has to plan and and code them, then they have to make it through testing and managment approval. I really feel this may well be an act of spite from Capcom because we wouldn't jump through their Hoops and Like what they told us to Like. Just a feeling...  Visually it tries to be Epic, Glorious and Cinematic - it's such a shame that Two thirds of the time will be spent looking at the Keyboard! If you thought RE5 has mega amounts of Quick Time then you ain't seen nothing yet. The 'JAKE' Level is almost exclusivly QT, and Visually Incomprehensable QT at that! Instant Kill After Instant Kill after Instant Kill after Instant Kill makes the Two Hours completing this level this seem MUCH longer. Hey Capcom...I didn't spend huge amounts of money on Top Quality components, sound systems and a HUGE TV so I can get neck Strain looking at my bloody Keyboard!! I bought this equipment because I wanted an immersive experience and to get 'Lost' in fantasy for a few hours. Personally I HATE Quick Time because it destroys the experience just as certainly as that annoying idiot who Talks over the Film in the Cinema does. This isn't Dragons Lair in 1985 for crying out loud, but that's what 'Playing' RE6 feels like for the most part. Give me Tank Controls any day over this.  While im in Rant Mode let's talk about the HUD - WHAT CHILD DREW THIS??!! How on earth this got past the post production before release is a true mystry, was this programmed on a Commodor 64 or something? Serously Capcom did you really not see how awkward this looks next to the fantastic graphics? It's like someone has grafted the Crime Computer from Huntsville on to the coding, the contrast could not be more obvious and more ill considered.  The Music - Anyone else notice that they stole the music from the Ravenhearst Games?  Ranting aside, and allowing for the Awful 'Wesker JR' Level what you have here are essentially Three versions of Mercinaries that try to share a common story but it's been done so badly that I just didn't care. The Chris level is a Buggy, Frustrating Clunk-Fest that REALLY showcases how bad the AI Partner system is (who just blocks your way from progressing and gets you killed) and the Genius idea of having the game root you to the spot in crucial arears of battle while choosing the most unhelpful camera angle possible for you. It also unfathomably switches back to Tank Controls for the last boss fight which again are mostly uresponsive so good luck with that.  There is a resonably good Leon stage with a passable Ada stage so to make things slightly better save these for last. Revelations 2 should have been the Real RE6, it is a much better game in all respects and I really do feel for all you whom bought RE6 at full price.",

But this? Capcom? hello? how the hell you call this resident evil? if i want to compare re6 to re4 i could say that re4 has scary sounds and suprise attacks form unknown monsters coming from nowhere and scare the hell out of you with strange mysteries that sometimes take ages to do, awesome guns and upgrades that you have to buy from a strange man in different parts of the game and the fact that if you wanted to save your game you had to save with one of those old typing machines and so many more things. But re6 has none of those things, all i can see in re6 is shooting and killing zombies with third person with a little action and that's it. i don't recommand this game AS A RESIDENT EVIL game since to be honest in my opinion the game has a wrong title. strory ends very soon as well compare to re4 and makes the rest of the game boring. very horrible version of resident evil, i think Capcom should do something srs for the next resident evil, game man this one is just so aweful.",

I can't really put my finger on what makes this game feel so awfull but I'll just run down the the list of anoyances.  So many bugs happen when kicking/stomping on zombies, quite often you'll glitch by a wall and be left with no health.  Guns feel really poorly. In previous games you can tell when an enemy is dead but in this game you'll quite often pump an enemy full of bullets only to realize he died 5 shots ago.  Autosave sucks, usually you're to busy fighting to notice when you've hit a save zone. Twice I had to redo an entire zone because I exited just before the next autosave.  Just when you think the game is done holding your hand through another sequence it happens all again, like i'm in a perpetual tutorial.  All in all it feels more like dead rising than resident evil.  I'm not even 2 hours into the game and allready it feels like a chore, but I'm going to try and beat it.",

The zombies stagger so much, it is hard to get the 2-5 head shots required for a single kill. But shooting is fine compared to the gameplay issues.  What I hate about this game! -25pts: The lack of ability to move. Feels like you might as well be on rails. The game forces you into an extremely confined space to walk through. Even in an empty hallway you are forced to walk around small desks. I would have rather they just put me on rails than whatever movement impairing thing they did here. -25pts: Teaching you how to use Dash, as the space bar, then taking the ability of using it away in the next section. The game kept allowing me to use it for 10 foot sections then taking it away. This whole first section of the board was 30 minutes long of slowly walking around bullcrap items just for the sake of walking around bs items. -1pts: The game is kind of silly making you walk through a room around tons of desks in a classroom, as if it is fun or challenging to move around objects constantly during the time of a zombie apocalypse when none of this crap matters and should be fully destructable. -50pts: The camera is wobbly on purpose. I told my son I had to squint so I could only see a portion of the crazy cam, as my screen is right in front of my face, like every pc player. He made the joke that when he gets in the car to drive and put his keys in the ignition that he too wobbles his head everywhere. This wobble cam was so bad in the first car scene that I said I have to quit and he agreed with me. This game was the first game to ever make me car sick, and that is a bad thing.  What I love about this game? +1pts: It has the Resident Evil tag on the name. +10pts: It is a zombie game with guns.  0/10 Would throw up again!

Since I never play the other game I felt really confused at first as to who was who and what role they had in the universe. If you want to have a compleate collection go for it...and try and get it on special sell. I do enjoy the 2 player.  This game is long to me and that cool but I had to take breaks. I thought only play as Leon and hi partner. After you beat his level you can play the other characters and see there side of the story.  I have only play a bit of the orignal first Resident Evil game and a bit of Resident Evil Revelations. There a lot of nice maps and detail to things. Cutceans camera could be a bit more fluid and less choppy on transitions movment fad in or out to black. A cutscines will happen all a sudden where you walk a few distence then it cuts to a cutcanes I guess it to load the scenes instead of right after another scnese had already load but I notice this in other game I have played. The game is just weirdness in it own I guess. Menu option screen to just edit setting is bit of a chore since your figuring out what the icon are even with a small discription.   Control feel clunky sometime even though I adjusted the mouse sensitivity but don't feel improvment, this can be ignored because after a while you get used to it. Though would like to try with a game controler one day. The gun system feels similuer to Metal Gear 2 shooting style (and maybe there other games but Metal Gear is one I like and notice) but I felt they done it better or calibrated it better in Metal Gear. Some of the action seem redundent like 'open the door fence that has a bar, I can simply reach my arm over the metal bars and lift the metal wedge. nothing stoping me from doing that.' 'Oh no, I can't climb over this desk it block by a small box and junk, yet in real life I can climb over a desk to not set off the sercurity gate alarm detector.' I could go on but yeah.   I feel it like a crazy action movie I'm watching. The cars or truck that just come out of knowhere and I'm like 'HOW THE HECK DO YOU SURVIVE THAT?' Even in video game logic. Maybe if the cheography sett up was done better it could be more belivabile like in some movies. Though animation is still great just feel like some of the film editing fad in to out could be a bit better.  It's a decent game even though it might have flaws. From somebody like me who has not really play the other Resident Evil game and can say from a neutral point is that the game is decent for what it is atleast for me.",

            "review_text": "(SPOILER FREE)  Not done playing RE6 yet.  Here's what I've got for ratings so far.    CAMPAIGNS/STORY   Leon's Campaign: 10/10 It's obvious that RE6 was supposed to be JUST Leon's campaign, but then decided to shoehorn the other campaigns and change the story, as Leon's campaign is VERY polished, while it does have it's flaws, it was a ton of fun to play. Zombies is what made his campaign good aswell. The Ending almost killed this campaign but it was good enough for me.    Sherry's Campaign: 5/10 (Pre ending 0/10) I don't even want to go into words on how flawed this campaign is. The ending is what saved it though. You fight a huge boss through out the game at specific moments. It tried a few new things, and while I do appreciate them trying something different, it didn't work out, and it's mostly due to 2 Major flaws  1. Horribly unpolished, and very buggy. 2. Most of it doesn't fit the gameplay.   Chris's Campaign: 4/10  FOOTBALL! Oh sorry, just remembered that Chris had the physique of a Football player in RE5. Then in RE6 he had the physique of a WWE Wrestler. The ending is what saved this campaign as usual. Not spoiling anything, I can't even tell you the feelings it made me feel because it needs to be spoiler free.  Moving on, this is the worst out of the bunch that I've played as of (Jan 02 2014) There is a part where you're running on boats and I kept falling through the ground, mostly because Chris wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing jump accrossed the damn gap, he'd just glitch down the ground and I'd fail. It took me 4 tries to get past it.  All you do in Chris's campaign till the ending is Call of Duty everything. Very unenjoyable, the final boss is so ♥♥♥♥ING cool, and is a VERY nice variety change, too bad it's THE FINAL THING YOU FIGHT IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING CAMPAIGN.  Cmon seriously Capcom? The only thing you do is shoot others that shoot back, if all the campaigns had Zombies it would've all be a ton of fun, shooting zombies NEVER gets old, shooting others that shoot back has been done to death. And the only reason why the campaign didn't get a 0/10 is because of the final boss and the ending.   Ada's Campaign: N/A Haven't played it yet.       MERCENARIES   It's hard as hell, but the new costumes are very nice. Though they only repeated 2 costumes with a color change. The 3rd costume is the same for everyone. Traditional LOD PS1 styled graphic models.  THANK YOU FOR THAT CAPCOM If you're wondering, I love old timey graphics, and PS1 is the holy grale of graphics for me, I love alot of LOD and low texture quality, although the models textures are just pixelated and look sharp, I absolutely love them, especially Sherrys, Leon's, Chris, and his partner.  There is something that keeps Mercenaries from getting a 10/10 or even a 8/10. THERE'S TOO MANY OF THE SAME DIFFICULT ENEMY! Seriously, I was doing really good as Leon (PS1) with a Sniper Rifle until there was 10 unkillable enemies and counting. Those big gorilla ones that have a shell around them.  How am I supposed to kill even one of them when I'm the only one and there's 10 of them charging at me!? The most annoying part is it's the same for ALL maps! I honestly though I chose No Mercy at first because it was real easy till I got ♥♥♥♥ing assaulted by hard to kill enemies. And the worst part is, I have to kill at least 150 enemies for a Plat rank? Sounds easy right? Not in the spane of at least 10 minutes.  I wish I could have up to 3 AI partners with me (optional of course) as it would be alot of fun to have Leon, Ada, Chris, and Sherry all fighting zombies at the same time. And in Campaign when you have 3 AI main characters, it's REALLY enjoyable to watch them follow you for some reason.  Over all Mercenaries is a HUGE step up from RE4's and RE5's.   (Additional Notes) While RE6 is not a fine gem, it is a fun game, at least with Leon's Campaign. I'd suggest buying RE6 for Mercenaries and Leon's Campaign, as Leon's Campaign is the only reason I bought RE6, then was dissapointed with the other Campaigns, though it would prolly be funner with a friend, having a friend removes you from the atmosphere, and turns the game into a boring shooter, although I don't have first hand expierience, my expierience is from RE5, so not a concrete opinion atm.    (SHOULD YOU BUY IT?)  Yes, just be warned, Leon's campaign is the only one you'd enjoy. Although on the other hand there is one problem.  The fanbase was cut 30/70 in liking this game.  I believe at least 15%-20% of the non likers don't like the game because it's not traditional Resident Evil (And other reasons I'll get into in a second)  Which is a valid reason. BUT, if you want to like this game, you have to remove what you know about Capcom, and previous installments, go in with a blank opinion, and you should like this game.  Personally, this is my current favorite Capcom game, as it feels like it's trying to do a 180 and go back to it's original Resident Evil ways, if not, at least a 90 degree angle. While I want and would prefer a traditional Resident Evil game, I'm glad that the game is at least different.  RE4 was a masterpiece, but it wasn't a RE game. RE5 recycled EVERYTHING from RE4 and had the fanbase spilt 80/20. (80% liking it) And was a mess of a game, however, it was a very fun game, just had the WRONG title.  RE6 was remade entirely, and was a great game, Leon's campaign being the only one to leave a dent in being a Resident Evil game, it was close, but wasn't enough, it went all over the place and should've been in one place, like a town or a building, to make the game a little more tense. (Not by much though)   Is Resident Evil 6 a good resident evil game: No It's a horrible Resident Evil game.  Is Resident Evil 6 a good game: Yes, it should've just expanded on Leon's campaign though maybe have Chris and Sherry and maybe Claire but none the less ,Leon's campaign was good  Leon's campaign took me at least 2 days to beat, although it took me 2-3 sittings to beat aswell.   (Final thoughts) Get it if you are looking to have fun. Don't get it if you are wanting to be scared, and have a good story.  The story is cheesy as ♥♥♥♥, but that's typical for Resident Evil.",

Pacman is less linear and has a far more cohesive and less obtrusive story and if you really don't care about the narrative it can be skipped. The ghosts are more memorable and threatening than every enemy in RE6 combined too because they actually trap or kill you and have distinctive behaviors that test your limited limited resources.

Chris and Piers(BTW: his nickname is Pirced Nipples) is most action based shooter, with lot of explosion and gunfire. More intensive version of RE5. Jake and Sherry ist most ballanced campaign, there is some shooting, some sneaking and big guy called Ustanak which will be chasing you through big part of scenario. Campaign is very simmilar in basis to RE3, both games you run from big badass unbeatable opponent(Nemesis in RE3, Ustanak in RE6). Ada, only campaign where you play alone without partner(with one exceptio, you play Online with friend or spiltscreen). There is some shooting, som puzzle and some stealth action. It has a little bit hard start, but is very very good storyline. I personaly recommend start play after you finish Chris capaign chapter 4, you will get great fabular twist. Gampaign simmilar to RE4. Game has nice grapthics(great charracter models), skill points system(replacing guns upgrading from previous game), and improoved shooting mechanic. Good: -story -characters -'chainsaw guy'  -Chris finale -shooting mechanic -Ada -optimization  Bad: -too much shooting -Ada(you will se why) -too much shooting(for some pepole) -Jake Sherry chapter 2-4(watch youtube walkthroug or you will be trolled) -Ada catacombs puzzle(same as above)  I i haven;t cheked Mp so i wond wright about this much.

Game's level's are highly detailed and from time to time it gets very atmospheric. It's looks great even by today's standarts. For story driven game most of the characters are quite dumb and have litle or no personality. AI is ok and your partner helps when needed and can stand for himself most of the time. Zombie variety is quite large and they act differently, so you have to change attack tactics. Gameplay wise it works well with ower the shoulder camera, when shooting heads or roundkicking some dude over the cliff. As for ugly side.. well, all the fun you could have get's molested by a**backwards control scheme and quicktime events. My god this game has lot's of it. Most of the boss fight's cann't be finished without them. O you think you get used.. here surprise one - missed.. too bad start over. On harder difficultie i can't mash buttons fast enough to fill the meter. Sounds bad, here even more - there are time based sections where game surprisigly takes away camera control, so you die running in to corner while some monsterr is chasing you. It's get 'better' with wehicle section, wich controls like bucket sliding down from hill (although it's looks awesome). Verdict: recomended on sale, if zombie shooting and roundkicking, lots of explosions, big bad monster fights, all that in pretty cool looking levels matters more than horible control scheme and infuriating quicktime events.

The story is told from four different points of view and you get to see how they handled it from their own perspectives. I felt that the story was told very well and it seemed like it was more realistic in the sense that you have Leon who has a lot of puzzles to solve while dealing with Zombies, Chris handles all the heavy action that would come in a bioterror event, Jake is found out to be the key to stopping the virus and he needs to be kept alive so that the world can be saved, and Ada is under her own agenda to expose the mastermind behind all this. {SPOILER ALERT} I really enjoyed the irony that Jake is the key to saving the world, and his father, Albert Wesker, was hell-bent on destroying it. In Leon's campaign and Ada's Campaign, I can tell that the makers were trying to have some creepiness in it. The only reason I liked Chris's campaign the best is because Chris Redfield is my favorite RE character. I also enjoyed how realistic the weapons and their properties were. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed in RE5 having an M92F with a clip that carries 100 shots because that's freaking awesome, but in reality, a handgun clip won't usually go higher than 18 shots. I just really liked that it felt more real than the previous two. Overall, I enjoyed this game because of how it hooks the player. I know this game gets some hate, but it's still fun and I highly reccommend it to any Resident Evil fan. I think that if you enjoyed RE4 and RE5, you'll enjoy RE6 due to its large amount of content and similar playability.",

            "review_text": "This is a decent Resident Evil title. And no, RE is not a horror game anymore, just get used to horror themed action already. RE6 improves drastically on gameplay and mechanics, finally giving us typical TPS controls with dedicated attacking/shooting on a trigger rather than using the action/confirm button for that.  Health now is measured by a bar composed of 6 sub-bars (?) which will regenerate  only  if one is not completely depleted, and the complete depletion of one results in the character being knocked out. Herbs now are turned into pills which recover one sub-bar each. That health system makes harder for the player to die against huge hordes of enemies, but doesn't allow them to abuse of it as in other games, making a good system if you hone your skills properly.  The player now has a stamina bar which depletes whenever they make a physical attack. Opposed to the previous titles in which you could only attack physically an enemy with knives or something in similat fashion. This broadens the possibilities of damaging enemies in many aspects since physical attacks deal a considerable damage, but punishes players who overuse it, since guns are there, as always.  Each campaign is themed around a type of gameplay, with Leon and Helena on a more classic take, hacing zombies and other type of monsters as enemies, Chris and Piers with a more modern take with Ganado-like enemies (J'avos) that resemble more a third person shooting game and Sherrie and Jake's which focus on a smaller combat/shooter aspect with some stealth and exploration sections. There's also another campaign which combines aspects of each, but that will be available only after completing the game.  The new skill system is much simpler than the weapon customization, but doesn't feels quite as glamurous, specially since how the customization worked on RE4 (which only went backwards in my opinion, REvelations is the only one that has a custom system that feels nearly as satisfying).  In terms of story RE6 is horrible. Is like they had ideas for the story, decided to scrap them and, for some reason, decided to made it apparent on the final version. Although it can be enjoyed, the story of the game is just plain bad.  I recommend this game if you're a more open-minded fan of the series or someoen who enjoy shooters in general. If you're a fan of the classic series I'd recommend on a sale or just to skip it altogether.",

There are too many QTEs though that seemed to have been toned down a bit from when I played it on XBOX 360 bit that is a fault of many a game and the plot and action are ridiculously over the top but there is an enjoyable game at the heart of it all, shooting a jumping, jumping back, rolling to dodge and then shooting a zombie in the face before getting back up and punching it in the face, all feels fun and I liked the control system a lot once I got used to it.

I love The remake and RE0 and played the originals in Sega Saturn, well the original as I had to trade that console for the ps1 and one of the main reasons I did that was because of RE2. So I know the series, I love them but I'm not obsessed with them either.  This game does certain things really well and then it destroys them by poor decisions. I will say that the stories are corny but I can say that most RE storied are weak in the writing arena. I mean hell, they don't take the too seriously and it's ok with me...as bad as the story is in terms of writing it still gets me hooked as every other RE, I played this a while ago, just did a restar of 5 and 6 so I had forgotten most of the story...so yes the story is corny but I did dig the way it was told in a way of diving each characters into chapters. I enjoyed Leon's the most but found the others appealing too.  The game visuals are really good in terms of a RE game, you will still have crappy textures but things look quite good and in my case the game ran perfectly with no hitches whatsoever.  So to make it short it will remind you of RE5 and in someways if you've played Revelations 2 it'll be very except you cannot switch characters on this one. And that makes it interesting because you can play with either character but the gameplay will change in some situations depending on who you chose in that particular story...it's cool and adds a bit of replayability.  The problem is how scripted is is, something I missed was shooting at an enemy on the floor to see if they were dead that doesn't work as they're depedant on script which is really annoying..also when an enemy mutates it has this invulnerability moment where you can empty your mag and nothing, so you need to wait untill the mutate as to not waste ammo.   But the worst and I mean the worst, specially if you play with K&amp;M and not controller are the quicktime events, they're fast annoying and the scape sequences mixed with QT events are the most annoying I've ever played. I mean people complained about this back in RE4, they should know this crap is lazy development...I can't tell you how many times i died because my character went left instead of right and boom, you're dead...  So I don't want this to be a full fledged review becuase I don't have the patience.So it's fun, it's good looking, it's got some solid gameplay but they screwed up with far too many QT events and some silly decesions in terms of scripting everything. So I'll give this a 7,5 -8 for me...closer to the 7,5 than to the eight though.  ",

Overall the combat was fine, but there are a few things that make this game really wonky. Leon's campaign was not bad. There are times when you look over at Helena (or the other AI companions) and they are running in circles while you are fighting the bosses, but whatever. In Chris's campaign, there are a couple times when he must run for his life, and the camera angle changes while you are pressing forward and run. When that happens, you start running back toward the enemy. It's totally a live or die one mistake kill situation, so it's very frustrating to run back and forth with the camera changing. Chris however, in combat tears it up, as he has a grenade launcher that destroys everything. Jake and Sherry are ok, but the game has a bad habit of coming out of a movie sequence with the infected beating the crap out of you while you are still frozen and unable to move. In some cases they get 3-5 seconds of free shots in, which on pro difficulty is enough to die. Ada was fun, though I wish all the characters could have carried the magnum, as it is still the most powerful weapon in RE games. Bottom line? This game would be worth full price with less QTE's, better camera angles, and smoother transition between the movie clips and the game. As it is, it's worth the sale price I paid for it, and I am happy I played through it, though I doubt I will replay it as I have RE4 and RE5 (3x each, and getting ready to replay RE4 in HD)",

Cons: - A decent computer can run this game at 60fps but you will still stutter at some points. This can get you killed.  - Chris’s campaign is rushed and two boss fights are virtually impossible to beat without dying over 10 times. You have to race against the clock, fight the camera changing angles during those fights, and be perfect or die a lot.  - Multiplayer is dead.

The campaigns (4 of em) are not worth it, though there is a lot of mostly mediocre content here, so it'll last you a while.   The campaigns are pretty bland and average for the most part; it's Resident Evil meets Michael Bay x1000. The storyline is peppered with setpieces of the eye-rolling variety, where the characters' circumstances tend to be ridiculous to the point that you can't be immersed for very long before yet another near-death scenario rolls around... and another, and another, and so on. You're also likely to drown in quicktime events during these scenarios.  That said, the Mercenaries extra content is pretty great, particularly the No Mercy mode, which includes far higher enemy spawns as well as Left 4 Dead characters &amp; enemies. It quickly turns overwhelming given the number of enemies that swarm you and is easily the most redeeming facet of the game, from my experience at least.  The controls are mostly decent with a controller, the largest exception being the cover controls and the fact that hopping over objects is glued to the same button / key as sprinting. Prepare to unintentionally hop or slide over a lot of stuff the second you run nearby. That aside, the controls aren't too bad - definitely different from RE4 and RE5 though. And yet, the controls are horrible with a mouse &amp; keyboard, which is disappointing considering that those were amazing in RE5. At any rate, you're afforded the ability to move while reloading and dive, dodge, and buttscoot around while shooting, so that's nice.  So to reiterate: Buy it on sale. Definitely do not buy it at full price. Quantity over quality here.",

The enemies are repetitive, and yet the atmosphere created by things like the creepy soldiers that mutate into horrifying abominations when attacked is just brilliant and really stays in the mind. It's not scary 90% of the time but then stuff like the final boss of Ada's story is eerie as can be. It's the bestworst game in the franchise!  It's a hoary analogy at this point, but it really is like a double album with a single album's worth of good songs on it, and those songs are good enough to justify buying it i think. It's a hot mess and some parts will make you want to burn down your own house with rage, but if you're a fan of the franchise and creepy bio-horror aesthetics then there's a whole lot of content here, and what's here is distinctive enough that it'll be someone's favorite game in the franchise and that someone could be you. As for me, i love the Revelations games above all, but i really don't regret playing 6-- the good parts make it worth it.

Devs want to keep players tense and immersing by canceling the pause of the setting menu in game, which is a terrible decision-making and doesn't add on any tension and horror into the game progress, only makes players feel annoying. And each chapter is cut into 3 to 5 stages, but the saving icon is displaying in totally different time from the stages, which misleads players for reload points. And the crappy control, I don't get why resident evil would get this crappy at designing the control style, this control style is virtually anti-human. I play the whole game on xbox 360 controller.   But the merits of the game is the clever design of the plot and the intersections of each main characters.  Ada Wong is actually the one who reveals the whole story from the other angle and pushing the storyline chronologically to the end, and her intersections with other main characters. So if you play the game from the original order, it's fine, which would give you a stunning storytelling, but if you want to read the plot in a common way, play Ada Wong's first, then the next three are free to choose which one to begin.     The main stage of RE6 happens in China, Hong Kong?, Every character would happen to meet each other before this big scenery, and each character carries their own past and demons to fight back Simmons and Neo-Umbrella. Leon is deemed to save the whole world by killing Simmons, Chris's goal is to exterminate all the living BOWs with his corporal comrades, Jake is the key character in the whole RE6 who has antibody of C Virus, and Ada, who reveal the whole story from a different angle by helping all the characters on their journeys. The plot designed very brilliant and contenting, the intersections of each character feel so heart-pounding. But the ending is kind of disappointing, coz it doesn't unveil pretty much information about the sequel and the endings of the incidents over the globe.     Recommend buying this one on sale.",

Chris's campaign was the most boring and cringeworthy for me and I'd rather see it gone from the game alltogether since both Chris and Jake fight the same enemies. Jake's campaign was suprisingly good albeit short. Leon's campaign would be better had the developers tried to make it even remotely scary, however its setting and locations partially make up for lack of horror. Co-op experience is fun and makes the game way more enjoyable as does the hunter mode in which you can play as a monster and invade oter people's games. Overall it's an obvious step towards making the franchise an third person action game which wouldn't necessairly be a bad thing had Capcom not tried to reinvent the wheel by messing with perfectly good menu, upgrade and inventory systems from RE5 and replaced it with new ones.",

This type of gameplay is very intuitive, I only wish it had horror elements like Resident Evil 4 provided. A third person horror game can be created as seen with Dead Space 1 and 2. I don't believe this is a bad game but I'm still not a fan of the QTE's unless it's button mashing but that's about it. PS. You'll probably get mad in a certain Chris &amp; Piers mission where you have to run across a bridge... You might want to do that offline but it doesn't seem to have a set timer.",

            "review_text": "  This game is garbage. You cannot remap controller bindings nor can you disable the controller from the options to use Xpadder. When I tried to remap the controller settings, I was unable to select anything to replace the controls I wanted to remap, nor could I exit out. The only way to exit out after selecting something to remap is to either A; close and restart the game or B; unplug the controller so it defaults back to the mouse and keyboard, kicking you out from the controller remap screen.  My specific problem happens to be with the camera controls. For some reason, everything else works just fine except for the camera. When I tilt the right joystick up, the camera turns right, down turns to the left, left tilts down and right tilts up. This means that Capcom is either under the impression that people hold their controllers sideways with the bumper pads facing the left, or they're just incompetent. It's almost as if they didn't playtest this game before publishing it.  I played a co-op campaign with a friend and we encountered the following problems:  #1: Enemies stagger when damaged and they do not take damage of any kind during their stagger animation, you have to wait for them to regain composure and point their gun at you before you can shoot at them again, which can last up to five seconds per stagger. Otherwise, you're wasting your ammunition on nothing. In fact, this applies to all enemy animations, from the giant bestial zombies 'hatching' to a zombie mutating its limbs after taking damage.  #2: Melee is shoddy &amp; botches constantly. You will run up to an enemy you stunned with a flare grenade only for your arm to swing over the zombie as it's writhing around during its stun animation. Then you'll turn back and take another swing and botch again, only to get hailed by gun fire with your back to the zombie. Should you successfully connect, you can flip a zombie on its back and stomp its head in to kill it. The problem is the zombie flies two feet away from you, giving it a chance to get up before you can finish it off. Should you run up to it in time, the prompt to kill it only appears about 1/3rd of the time, letting him get up to melee or shoot you anyway.  #3: Bullets can phase through walls so taking cover means next to nothing.  #4: Enemies spawn from nowhere and always right behind you.  #5: Enemies with powerful artillary are cheaply place around corners &amp; behind doors to jump-kill you instantly. We encountered a zombie with a sniper rifle hiding around a corner and were killed the instant we crossed its line of sight.  #6: The game is stingy with health drops. The game rarely gives you health item drops and the scripted health items are far and few between. I was revived from the brink of death by NPCs more often than I ever encountered health items. Once you do encounter herbs, the game awkwardly employs it in your inventory. First, you mix the green and red herbs, which create a pill packet. You'd think that'd be the end of it but no, you have to then assign it to your case and use the healing item by pressing the 1 key. This is all that the 1 key is ever used for.  #7: The inventory is stupidly limited. Let me stress that this is not a horror game, it is an action-horror game. It expects you to mow down hundreds of enemies &amp; to do it with less than 300 bullets between every gun, which includes grenades and health items. I'm not being hyperbolical.  #8: Skillpoints. The skillpoints constantly gyp you out of getting valuable items like ammo or the even more coveted health items. Skillpoints are all you get 2/3rds of the time from either killing enemies or smashing crates. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if skillpoints weren't a worthless feature of the game. I unlocked level 3 for firearms, level 3 for defense and level 2 for fixing the swaying aim of the gun and I noticed no notable difference. Much like in Evil Within, where the gun is fixed to miss 2/3rds of the time, the aim is fixed to constantly sway and force you to miss, even if your actual aim is perfect.  #9: Aiming the gun is 50% of the challenge in this game. The crosshairs mean nothing, the red dot at the center which dances across the screen constantly is what matters. Lining up your shot is nearly impossible unless you're at point blank range or you have cover that makes it impossible to hit you.  #10: If you get shot and lose a full block of health, your character is knocked down and you have to sit through a five second animation of him shakily getting up and dusting himself off, making it possible to take damage multiple times and to be killed, punishing you for getting hit even once.  #11: The game uses the spacebar for absolutely everything, from opening doors, to sprinting, to climbing walls. This is a massive problem when you're trying to sprint away from a horde of enemies and end up climbing a structure instead because your character was just barely close enough for the context sensitivity to change, which ends in you being shot to death.  #12: There is no genuine challenge to this game, the game's challenge is defined by cheap encounters, limited inventory and a broken control scheme.   Just play Resident Evil 7 instead.",
