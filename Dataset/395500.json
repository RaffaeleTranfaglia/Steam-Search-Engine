            "review_text": "Time to complete:  25  minutes Price: $1.69(15% off) at time of purchase. $ 1.99  is the original price.    Rot Gut   is a Platformer with a Noire-themed aesthetic that is minimalistic in gameplay but contains loads of personality in 25 minutes. The theme is black-and-white/grayscale with red highlights. You play as Unnamed Agent Man in the Prohibition Era of the US. Agent Man sees the murder of a man and follows, finding the body to be disposed of into an incinerator. From here the game is played as a 2D-Platformer with 2 guns available at the start. There are nice little details in this game, like how early on you receive a chest placed pretty clearly to teach you how to better use your Double Jump. Also notable is the cigar in mister Agent's mouth. It glows red and smoke comes up from it. Even if it's a small touch like that, a well-put detail is very much appreciated. There are 3 weapons in total, one of which being unlocked after one of the two(yes, two) boss battles. Enemy variety is pretty small, at about 6 enemy-types seen by the end of the game. The more interesting one includes the dog, which adds a small twitch reaction to the game whenever you think the way is clear. The music is very much of the 20's, being made up of jazzy chiptune pieces meant for looping, and is one of the strongsuits of  Rot Gut . I think my favorite song is the theme for the first level,  Down at the Docks .  Overall, while the enemy variety is lacking as well as the game being incredibly short,  Rot Gut  was incredibly fun with catchy music and nice little details like the cigar and the transitions between levels. However, if 25 minutes doesn't sound like a good amount of time to spend with the game, then I wouldn't recommend buying it, as I'm honestly one of the worst Platformer gamers out there and I still finished this game in the stated timeframe. However, the personality and music themselves and some vision of this becoming a speedran game(Hint, hint) win me over and I hope the same will be said for others. ",
