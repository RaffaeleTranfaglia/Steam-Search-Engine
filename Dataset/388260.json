            "review_text": "Alright, this is my review for SSDT! As previous reviews said, if you like arcade, fast-paced action sports games, this one is for you! Choose your favorite athlete and you're ready to go!  You can customize about everything about the match; Time per period, number of periods, arena size, what kind of ball appears, events that can occur right in the middle of the match, the number of points given depending on how the goal was scored, etc. You can also select from 4 different colors for your team.  Different kind of sports means different kinds of goals to be scored. You can shoot in the net (with or without a keeper), shoot in the hoop or aim for a long toss between american football posts. Each athlete has different kind of shots, try them all to find your favorite one!  The AI can be harsh sometimes but you can edit its skill as well.  Couple downsides though. There is no online multiplayer mode (I secretly hope for one in the future) and the price may seem a bit out of reach for some people.   TL;DR Bought it yesterday, quick matches, fun game, worth its price IMO. Good job Tipping Goat!",
