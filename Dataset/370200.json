            "review_text": "Wow. This is probably the 'game' I liked least this year.  So, why?  There is exactly one puzzle to solve in this game. The puzzle? The fact that you have to quit out of the first part of the game, to start the second part of the game. With the game giving you a warning that you should 'finish part one' first, even though there's nothing to 'finish' -- aside from getting into the endless loop.  The story started off cryptic and interesting. Honestly, I was expecting something like 9-9-9 / Zero Escape here. The theme could have been used well. Instead, it was wasted.  There are literally no choices in the game. And, realistically, there is no *ending* to the game. Nothing is resolved, because the entire concept is an endless loop. That means that the entire game is one big tease. You're left with questions,  Ultimately, this is not a game. It's not even like 9-9-9 on the iOS, where you make a few branching path choices...because there's no choice the player ever makes in the game. *YOU* are not wanted here, aside from as an observer.  I'm glad I got this game as part of a bundle, because I can't condone paying for it.",
