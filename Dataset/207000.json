            "review_text": "I really tried to like this game but I just can’t. I usually like almost every game that game reviewers bashed but this one is impossible to love. The biggest problem is the difficulty. I tried to play with a game pad and it’s almost impossible to get good scores. With a keyboard and mouse it’s easier but, nevertheless, the game is so damn hard. Games are supposed to be fun, to help you escape from stress and reality but with this one, you’ll get mad, frustrated and maybe with a headache!  I appreciate the developer’s work. The graphics are nice and the spider looks cute but if you want to play the game as it’s supposed to be, the difficulty is unbearable.  ",

            "review_text": "A very nice and fairly difficult platformer. I love platformers with grappling line/swinging gimmicks and that is basically what this is all about. The jumping is a little bit floaty but you will be thankful for that because it will give you time to aim your landing better. You have to be incredibly precise with both your jumpinng and swinging to succeed.  The game is score-attack based. It is totally possible to clear stages but take so many times and miss so many point icons that you are left with an absolutely embarrassing mediocre score. That's prettymuch where I am with it right now. If you are the type of player that enjoys games like Dustforce or Super Meat Boy where you practice and get better and better until you can clear levels in one fluid motion I would recommend it. It is a game for perfectionists and I'm not sure I will have the patience to clear all of it.  What I have played is fun.",

            "review_text": "This game is a nice concept marred by awful execution and unrealistic expectations of the player. The way to score points requires you to be absolutely perfect most of the time if you want to get more than even 1 star, much less 5. The web-physics are also a little buggy, every time the web connect the spidy jitters around weirdly and loses momentum for no reason. This is a game simply not worth trying to finish, and that such a small percentage of players has even cleared the first world (which I did manage) should be a red flag that it's not just difficult, but flat-out broken.",

Normally I can get used to hard controls of a game, but this game's 'web' the alien shoots flips out and doesn't respond well as it can be reeled in and elongated while swinging, messing with it's actual swinging mechanics and sometimes even causing the web to be shot upside down. I wanted to like this game more, and probably would have, except that broken swing mechanic which is about 90% of the important of it. I'm afraid I won't be getting through all of this game.",
