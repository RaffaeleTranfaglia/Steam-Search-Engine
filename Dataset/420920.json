If you have set it on stretched window use the hotkeys to navigate to the video settings (press alt to see hotkeys in the menu)  You can also change the settings in the settings.txt in the game folder. Go to the game properties in steam -&gt; local files -&gt; browse local files -&gt; settings.txt",

            "review_text": "The presentation in this game is awful: the graphics are all different styles and often have nasty looking borders round them. It gives the appearence of a game from the early 90s. There's low res pictures with visible jpg artifacts in them and the music is repetitive as heck.  Having said that the game itself seems like it could be a good one: there's certainly a lot of scope for customizing your character at the start and there's a lot of spells in the game.  If you wonder why you can only see the square you're in when you start, I think it's dark: you need to cast a spell of light of some kind (there's more than one).  Will write more after having played more.",
