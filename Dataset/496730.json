            "review_text": "If you bought the original SK, at this point the game doesn't add enough to be worth it - not enough new content to justift the price tag- it's more like a couple of $5 DLC's and a patch.  If you haven't bought the original SK, this game is very good and is worth it for its hybrid 4X/RPG gameplay, though I would recommend jacking he difficulty up, as the game needs a challenge to be worth it. There's a decent amount of replayability, but it's a hybrid of RPG and 4X in that regard- the first game peaked at about 50-60 hours for me, and this one about 10 max.  Giving this a positive review because the game is a good game for those who haven't bought the original SK- I would give it a wait for sale for fans of the original. I do think Rivals was unnecessary to make- the original SK is almost the same experience.",

I am only 2.3 hours into my first game of Rivals. I'm playing a tinkerer, I've got a dwarven hero, and I just acquired Tandis. I like the idea that I can win a couple ways now. So far the game is everything I expected. No complaints. Always room for more enhancements and additional content, of course. Stardock is great about supporting games for years so I feel like this is a whole new chapter in the Sorcerer King saga with much more to come. Definately a thumbs up for me.",

            "review_text": "I enjoy it so far. The original sorcerer king was hard to get into, but I find myself coming back to play this pretty often. I'ts a medium mix of 4x and rpg.  Pros:    looks nice, plays nice, even on my crappy laptop    rpg elements are fun, very fun    heroes are unuiqe and varied    you can buff up and make normal troops pretty awesome    extremely fun exploration and questing    soverign levels (empire level, kinda of like tech tree), heroes level, and spell research - works decently well, but I find every game I just minimize spell research, since soverign and mana are so much more powerful    summons are cool    can win via conquest (kill the sorcerer king) or cast a spell to become a god, or build a wonder    tactical battles are fun   Cons:    inventory management is a pain. Not early game, but mid-late    Late game is a slog, a mix of too much inventory and units/spells scale bad at very high levels    Late game, normal squishy units are uselss (archers, enchanters - one shot by high lvl monsters)    Spells - early, too expensive and late game, not powerful enough    No tech tree    summons too weak, cost too much early and are too weak later    tactical battle auto ai can be silly, having 8 melee guys all gang around 1 target, even if it means not attacking that turn and skipping several good targets   If you like RPG and 4x, its a blast. If your a HUGE fan of RPG, its a good buy. If you really like 4x, but not rpg, save your money. Stardock, so far from my experience, is a good company and their on the forums asking for feedback for balance and patches.  ",

The strategic layer and the story are interesting. I had a couple of CTD by loading savegames from the main menu, but nothing major. I am sure the dev team will come up with a solution. Overall a goood product. I recommend it to everyone who likes strategy games set in a fantasy universe.",
