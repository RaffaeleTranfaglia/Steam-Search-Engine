Hello everyone I'm reviewing  Kumoon : Ballistic Physics Puzzle  on behalf of the groups  Youtubers Unite  and  Twitchers Unite  The developer for the game was kind enough to hand out beta keys for the groups which was super kind of him.   Now for the review",

Serious review: Beyond my fondness for ballistic physics puzzles with lots of ricohets, I found the cute and simple environment and robot extremely aentertaining. The simple and mostly wordless in-game interface, HUD and tutorial are a plus, and likely made it easier for the developer to provide a LOT of language options without worry about poor grammar or syntax. My only concern is that really small children will get frustrated when they can't figure out how to ricohet the ball enough to get the high scores. But then, kids need to learn patience, perseverance and geometry.",

I was able to complete it in a little under three hours. The puzzles we're very difficult at all. The 'hard' puzzles were very long and tedious, but not difficult. This game will give you something to do for three hours.",
