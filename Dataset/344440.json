HOGs 4/5- Some very excellent areas, I actually had to spend some time to find things instead of finding everything in a couple minutes.  Story: 4/5 – Good for a casual game, 7 deadly sins are always fun. I actually cared what happened in the story rather than just searching for the next puzzle. I did feel like the end was a bit rushed.  Graphics: 4/5- Very nice drawings and areas, unique as well and not just copies of each other. (Also I love the torture devices they add for the wrath area).",

The story is good and makes you wanna figure out what happened and the soundtrack is pretty decent. The only thing that annoyed me was the map, had to move back and forth all the time, but the game is still pretty good. 8/10",

            "review_text": "This is one of the first HOGs I played, and they nailed it right out of the box. I'm a fan of creepy sanitariums and asylums, so this is right up my alley. Like all HOGs, the length of time that it takes to play only adds up to around 4-5 hours, but the storyline is very gripping. This last time I played, thanks to Steam, I went straight through the main game without stopping, realizing that I was getting close to bedtime :P I don't tend to listen to the music so much, there's too much background noise going on in the house to worry about it. And there's no voice acting to worry about, which sometimes can be a bad thing if you're looking for more realism. However, the graphics are terrific. Also, the map shows you where to go to do things, but it doesn't have an auto feature to take you where you need to go next.",

            "review_text": "This is a great point and click / hidden object adventure. The storyline is intriguing and the puzzles are largely intuitive although do take a bit of thought. The hidden object scenes are very challenging and so make for a great experience for those who have played a lot of these games. The story eventually still leaves you with unanswered questions, but all in all a very good 4 hour game.",

            "review_text": "Good music; good art; compelling storyline; logical puzzles - I enjoyed this very much. The hidden objects challenging without being frustrating, and at each stage, I was eager to find out what happened next. This game avoided the often-creepy side of horror mental hospital settings; the focus was on the angel/demon storyline rather than gore or psychological trauma. (There are bits of both, but they're background details.)   However, the negative reviews all have valid points - there's no instant map travel, and many of the hidden object zones are repeated. I like that; I get more practice with what I didn't notice the first time, and I like the plot aspects of 'oh, and last time you passed this cluttered corner, you failed to notice the screwdriver; this time, you'll pick that up.' But those who find that frustrating are not going to like this game; some scenes are used three times.  The pacing was a bit off - it started slow, and picked up and never slowed down, so the ending felt a bit rushed. But in my mind, the story was worth that, and the magic activation scenes (runes starting to glow, light filling a diagram, etc.) were lovely - flashy enough to be interesting, and quick enough that they didn't feel like a delay.   I'd give this a rating of 7 out of 10: if it hits your buttons, it's awesome; if any of its flaws are big red flags for you, the awesome parts probably won't make up for that; if neither of those is true, it's probably an enjoyable game, but not one that's likely to become a favorite.",
