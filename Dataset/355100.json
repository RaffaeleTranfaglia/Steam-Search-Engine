    "description": "Dungeon Crawlers is a game designed to explore the fun and funny concept of what &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; might've looked like if it were set in a dungeon. It's a turn-based strategy game that is easily accessible. Don't expect to dive too deep into statistics and weapons types here. The interface is highly streamlined.",

The new font is so much better and the fast response make me comfortable in recommending this game now.  Good work by the dev. in the speedy response.   *********************************************************************************************************************  As it stands I can't recommend this game, However, if the issues get resolved and it works I'll be more then happy to change my review. I'll keep my eyes on the updates for this.  Dungeon Crawlers HD is a turn based strategy dungeon crawling game, shocking I know!          YouTube™ Video:  First Look - Dungeon Crawlers HD&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "This is a cute game that embodies classical RPG style of the late 80's/early 90's. Remember those gold box games? The combat is nice and turned based like those. While it doesn't have an expansive scope or story, it does what it is designed to do well--crawl through dungeons and kill stuff!",

            "review_text": "The game itself is similar to how a board game would play. I enjoyed playing up until the first puzzle, the Banshee Queen. Which to me is a trial and error puzzle. There are no clues as what to do and in which order to do it. So you have to play the section multiple times. You can't study the room and work out what to do, which to me was a major frustration. I don't want to sit here for ages, playing it over and over just to see if I can get it right this time. But maybe I'm missing something? It is a pity about the trial and error puzzle aspect, I was enjoying the game up until that point. But it has squashed any desire to play the game more. Maybe I will come back to it in the future. There are many other games that don't have the frustration element but are just as fun. I felt the game could have done with dice rolls on screen. It playes like a board game &amp; I feel visible dice rolls would add to the enjoyment. Can I recommend it? Yes, if you can get past the frustration of random guess what to do puzzles. At this point I can't.",

Once the game starts you are prompted with Start the game, Enter the Store....after playing the first level, I didn't even have enough to buy the ♥♥♥♥♥iest item, which can only mean it was a pay-to-win on the mobile version.  Eventhough the game is cheap, avoid it. It is not worth the time and money.",
