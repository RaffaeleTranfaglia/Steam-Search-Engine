Lots of decisions to make, sometimes I agonise over how I should spend my money (they call it souls). The costume bit is fun :D  Cracked me up when I saw some of the enemies... You'll see :) politically incorrect, but hey it's just for fun. Plus lots of references to movies and the rest of our pop culture.  I can't think of much improvements for this lovely gem. It's a good fun game, much less on the repetitive clicking.  Your finger would develop a tiny brain after playing this much smarter clicker game.",

It's a shame that such artistic talent had to go that direction; it did a disservice to the game as a whole. The gameplay, music and detail are all fantastic but... why? -_-  If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, well, go for it... I didn't see any real humor in it.  In before 'too sensitive SJW lolz' you have your opinion I have mine.",
