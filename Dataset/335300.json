            "review_text": "Some people cry that Dark Souls 2 is ultra mega hard, but in my opinion it's easier than DS 1 and like in 1 in 2 all you need to do is not give up, find your motivation and move forward. You will die and lose anyway doesn't matter how powerfull and pro you think you are. If you don't believe me, then go and try PvP.   Now I will try to sum up by making list of some cons and pros.     Pros:  - even when you beat all bosses and watch credits you can still play this game, - many, many different armors and weapons which can be upgraded, everyoneone will find weapon he enjoy (in, let's call it 'late game' of course), - bosses looks very effective and they are real challenge like they should be even if you summon other players for help, - covenants makes game more interesting (especially  Company of Champions ), - rumors say that maximum level is 838,  - it is quite long and for me it wasn't boring, - varied locations, -  VERY GOOD DLC'S,  - sound is awesome, especially in boss fights, - more than 3 classes to chose at the beginning, - a lot of treasures and secret locations to find, - sometimes makes you satisfied, - video isn't perfect but it's good, - learns how to deal with loss.   Cons:  - magic makes game easier, it's too powerfull, - there are still Xbox prompts, - sometimes playing this game is just waste of time (trying kill boss 2 hours and fail), - AI sometimes decide to commit suicide, -  MESSAGES 2 centimeters from Illusory Walls so you can't 'open' them,  - you can be invaded by more than one player when you are going to finish stage which you try do from hours, - cheaters,  - sometimes PvP is not possible because of servers, -  MATCHMAKING by Soul Memory and not by level  (for some it may be good thing, but in my opinion that was a bad idea).  I recommend that game to everyone who have time and who is looking for challenges.  This game is not for everyone  and I guess that's why I had so much fun when I learned how to play good, after hundreds deaths.",

This review is in no way applicable to newcomers, and I fully recommend buying this if you didn't already own DkS2.   Tl;dr here: I strongly discourage people from buying this game, due to two reasons.  1. You cannot transfer old saved data. This means that that character you spent 250+ hours leveling, gearing and upgrading? Yeah, you won't have access to him/her anymore. Bad luck, mate. The worst thing about this is that they choose to pass this off as 'impossible, due to the DX9 to DX11 upgrade', which I know is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I could transfer my saved files from several other games, including Serious Sam, Titan Quest, multiple Resident Evil titles etc.   2. If you're a Dark Souls achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ like myself, you will have to grab every single achievement again. That means venturing to NG2+ in order to obtain spells like Wrath of the Gods, Great Chaos Flame and more.    Sloppy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this is not okay, From Software.  A final note: While my in-game play time will read about ~1 hour for this game, don't be fooled. I have around 260 hours into the old Dark Souls II, but due to this being an ENTIRELY NEW LAUNCHER, for whatever bloody reason, it doesn't count those hours. If you don't believe me, like some sardonic miscreants, go to my Profile &gt; Games &gt; All games &gt; Dark Souls II. You can see my play time there.",

(sorry)  I enjoyed SotfS A TON! As you can see I wrapped up a lot of hours into it, and only few games can achieve that for me. This one did it. So let's have a quick look.  GRAPHICS - It's not too bad but it's not great either. But Dark Souls was never about graphics, was it?  GAMEPLAY - Very solid, hitboxes could use some work, sometimes you just end up stabbed even though you've clearly rolled away.  CONTROLS - As a keyboard/mouse user I've definitely used them even though the store page strongly recommends controller. The default setup is horrendous, however it's not too hard to tweak it to suit you. As it is completely tweakable. I HEAVILY recommend disabling double-clicking as the game responses to your click are then much slower. Also, the option is bugged and you have to switch it on and off every game restart. So get used to it if you're willing to stay for long.  STORY - I didn't follow it too much, but it looks like you're some kind of an undead, hollow, who needs to seek souls in order to lift the curse. And so you're told to meet the king of Drangleic, the kingdom we are in pretty much the entire game.  ANIMATIONS - Solid and fun to look at.  ITEMS - There's a great variety of items, I've been told there's a lot more than in Dark Souls 1.   SOUND/MUSIC - Great soundtrack. Some sounds do sound a bit old. Breaking for example, sounds very low quality to me. But it's good enough.  OVERALL - As someone who played really only through SotfS, I say it's an epic game, I've been really enjoying my time on it and I can totally recommend it!!  9/10    ",

            "review_text": "Bad business practices. Then again everyone seems to be getting on that boat these days, it still pisses me off though.  I only personally bought it because I always wait for a GOTY edition to come out with all the dlc's bundled to save money, and this is the closest thing I got to that.  The game itself is pretty good as a standalone game. That said it is not nearly as good as darksouls 1. And I don't think the 'enhanced graphics' in this version were significantly then DS1 with DSfix applied honestly, so I feel bad for how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the DX9 version must have looked without modding.  I'll assume most people here will be comparing it to DS1 so here pros of each game  DS1 + Better level design + Better lore + Enemy placements felt more fair + More interesting boss fights + Better Matchmaking System (SL vs. SM) + More intuitive stat system (Though it is nearly the same in DS2 I felt it was a little more streamlined in DS1) + Better item durability system  DS2 SOTFS + More Weapons + More Armor + Better Dual Wielding + Better overall PvP combat (Gear seemed to play less of a part in determining the victor) + Longer overall game time    My major gripe about SOTFS is that you needed to use almost 3 weapons in your loadout to make it between bonfires without them breaking. Overall I found the game pretty easy in comparison to the first, despite encountering what I would consider some unfair enemy placements.     If you have beaten DS1 to death and a craving a sequel this will feed your hunger well enough, just don't expect to be blown away or get something better then the first. If you haven't beaten DS1 go play that until you puke instead.",

            "review_text": "If you absolutely loved Dark Souls for every aspect of it, do not get this game. You WILL be disappointed and upset.   If you loved Dark Souls because of it's artstyle, do not get this game. When I first walked into the Heide's Tower of Flame area I thought I had started playing a Kirby game or something.  If you loved Dark Souls because it presented a hard but fair and enjoyable challenge, do not get this game. I love Dark Souls 1 because it manages to be a single player game while at the same time presenting a really fun and decent challenge. And it did so with out relying on any cheap or annoying gimmicks. The same cannot be said for this game. It will repeatedly put you against the same dark magic spewing miniboss time and time again. Somebody in the lighting department decided huehue, DARK Souls, let's make certain areas pitch black DARK. Just to make the player use a torch lighting mechanic that adds nothing to the gameplay what so ever. You will repeatedly lose maximum health with each death that cannot be regained without using this game's equivalent of humanity (did I mention that they completely trashed the old humanity system?).   Farming has been nerfed, now if you kill any enemy a certain number of times they will dissapear entirely from the game, only to return if you use and item that raises the area to the next New game level (NG+. NG++, and so on).  On the topic of health and cheap tactics, all healing has been nerfed. The estus flask heals you much slower, and the only alternative you have to it besides miracles, soul gems, heal even slower. Humanity does not exist in this game so don't even consider relying on that. Healing speed is not the only nerf the estus flask has gotten. The Kindling mechanic is gone. You now start with 1 swig in your flask and can have a maximum of 12. The upgrade process only increases it by 1 at a time. Oh, and you still have to upgrade the actual potency of your drink, that hasn't been made any easier to compensate.  The previous point is worsened by the fact that all character animations have been drastically slowed down. Did you love Dark Souls because of how smooth and fluid it's movements and controls were? Then do not buy this game. I swear my character was walking through some kind of syrup. This is somewhat lessened by adding points into the Adaptability stat (Read as, you must waste souls to level and extra stat in order to use your estus flask without moving in slow motion) but even after that the animations and recovery periods from any action are still slow.  I mentioned an Adapability stat. This is not the only new stat that has been added which is nothing more than a piece of a previously present stat. Remember how nice it was that you could boost equipload and stamina at the same time? Not anymore, that has now been split into 2 stats just to force you to spend more souls in leveling. The splitting of stats has actually even forced the pvp meta up 50 or so levels. Hope you like grinding through enemies that stop respawning.  In all, Dark Souls 2 abandons things which made Dark Souls 1 great, trades fair and fun challenges for annoying and cheap ones, messes with mechanics that did not need to be chagned only to leave them worse than they started, and is overall a disappointment after playing through the masterpiece which was Dark Souls 1. Your money is much better spent on the first game, at this point I am certain that I can guarantee you will have more fun with it.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I have been playing all Souls games to get a feel for them individually. Dark Souls 2 seems to be the ugly cow in the farm mostly do to the fact that the original game director was busy with Bloodborne. Well, I must say that is not an issue and the team responsible for making this game did a great job. In the presentation department, the world seems fuller. Also, there are more npcs this time around that breath life into the world. Story, while still vague, is presented in better fashion than the previous game and as you explore along, some areas really depict a believable history in the World of Drangleic. Giants, fallen kings, betryal, war, humanity. The world has rich lore and it's sold pretty well, if you look for it.     Combat feels smooth, new animations look good and are varied. It's a bit slower though and character feels heavier when performing certain animations which I don't prefer but it's not a big issue. Had problems with the lock-on not locking on when I wanted to nor changing targets which is annoying but it can be managed.    The biggest downside for me is in the boss battles. There are more this time around but they have been stripped down and eased up from previous game. Most of the bossess designs seem unespired and only a few stood out. It does not compare to the Original game where every boss was memorable. While some would be easy but they where still impactfull. Here, not so much.    On a lighter note, I have to give MAYOR props for the guys who optimized and configured this game. Game runs really smooth and in the highest settings. The original Dark Souls suffered from mayor frame rate drops and I experienced the same in Dark Souls 3 even on lowest settings. Goes to show that the team behind this game, did a great job without the direction of 'THE BIG MAN.'   To conclude, the game is great regardless of some minor let downs. Pvp is an improvement. A number of areas where desgined as battle arenas for online play and serve as interesting playgrounds. Some areas are challenging to traverse like Iron Keep and the game changes tone as the game goes on. The world may not be the masterful design the Original was but, it's still a world worth exploring with some amazing set pieces. Also. all three chunks of dlc are superb and challenging. Great stuff here.",

The changes keep things relatively fresh while playing and there's a lot of little touches that change the ambience for the better.  The new enemy placements can feel a little overwhelming at first but that is usually remedied by playing smart. That said, I was somewhat disappointed in the purported 'graphics enhancements.' The game still does not feature the real time ambient lighting that its early demos showcase. From what I have played so far I'd say the changes are worth $20. If you're currently spending time wishing that Sony would grace us with Bloodborne then I'd advise you to go ahead and grab Scholar of the First Sin.",

Also the soul memory system was terrible. 2 is also probably the longest in the series. Get scholar of the first sin it comes with all the dlcs. Even with its flaws, I'd still recommend dark souls 2.   3 would be the middle ground. The pvp is ok, get the DLC to acess wth arena which is fun. While the level design is better than 2 i find it not as good as part one. I still recommend it for anyone who wants to play a dark, action, adventure, rpg.",

            "review_text": "It's a decent, robust dungeon crawler with lots of equipment, spells, 4 schools of magic, and lots of content, but I can't help but feel disappointed by it, because it simply can't live up to the wonderful experience that was Dark Souls I, thanks to its poor, often overly linear level design, poorly thought-out world (both in terms of level placement, and the lore of the world), and idiotic, polarising mechanics changes that happened for no reason.  In terms of how it stacks up against the original Dark Souls II, it's slightly better. Scholar of The First Sin, however, has been criticised too much for the shady business practices behind it, and too unfairly lauded much more than it deserved, when it came to its design changes; and people ignore glaring design flaws that would be criticised to no end in other games. For example, the Pursuer, an early boss in the game, is supposed to pursue the undead, so Scholar of the First Sin opts to place him all about the world. An interesting idea, yeah, but every single Pursuer encounter has the exact same moveset, exact same weapon, and exact same basic arena (that being a large circular or rectangular plane). Other changes, too, like the Heide Knights (an obviously unfair enemy; being able to break out of your combos and instantly lash out for huge damage, encouraging the player to game the system with ranged tactics) appearing in Heide, or the Fragrant Branch of Yore system being much more heavily engrained result in some even more utterly unforgiveable situations; it is literally possible to get stuck in the Lost Bastille, and forced to kill yourself, if you use a certain Fragrant Branch. Needless to say, the level design may visit some interesting locales and vistas, but the actual layout of the levels themselves, and the movement engine, too, is on-par with amateur projects in Unity, even if it is a slight improvement over vanilla DS2.   Speaking of amateur projects, Dark Souls II's enemies and bosses are also utterly uninspired and game-y. The Old Iron King is a giant, Diablo-like torso, which you fight in a wasteland of lava, and it shoots fire lasers out of its hand. Dark Souls even tackled a similar concept with one of its bosses, but it was executed far better, given a genuinely tragic and sad backstory, and some interesting behaviours, and strangely enough, the Old Iron King is just as bad, gameplay-wise, as its Dark Souls I counterpart. There are also plenty of polarising mechanical changes. Combat in Dark Souls II may seem faster to inexperienced players, but in reality, pretty much every player action in combat has been artificially slowed down; you now chug estus at a leisurely, insanely slow rate, regenerate stamina at a 'I've never done cardio in my life' rate, and many movesets have been changed to be slower. Dark Souls II is poorly designed, however, and paradoxically, the enemies still seem to be designed for Dark Souls I; the Drakekeepers in a later area have nearly infinite stamina; the Lost Sinner has nearly infinite stamina, very little recovery time, and the ability to exploit low invincibility frames if the lights are turned off, and many enemies like the Manikins resort to running up to the player and flailing wildly, and these enemies are often placed in groups. All of this enemy placement just feels restrictive and cheap, whereas previous games never heavily encouraged the player to use spells, or ranged weapons, Dark Souls II seems to be constantly rewarding players who do this, while extending a middle finger to those who don't by throwing cheap, objectively unfair things at players, like invaders, i.e human NPC enemies, that have stats too ridiculous for any human player to ever get.  My biggest problem with DS2, and SoTFS, though, is that it has no soul. Dark Souls and Demon's Souls respectively were great experiences which will stay with me for years to come; and their atmospheres, worlds, and challenges all cultivated games which really resonated with a lot of people, but most indicting thing I can say about DS2, is that it's 'just another game'.  The truth is that Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is a fairly good dungeon crawler, which ironically has many fewer design flaws than your average, run-of-the-mill modern games, and one with lots of areas, and countless weapons, spells and armour sets to experiment with, and there's a lot to see, and there are some stand-out bosses and areas; and the DLC areas in particular have some spectacular bosses (and two utterly ♥♥♥♥♥ bosses), and there is certainly lots of great design work to see in Dark Souls II, but there's too much to hinder the enjoyment of most people who really appreciated Dark Souls I.  Personally, I recommend that you start with another game in the series, or that, if you've just completed Dark Souls I, you go back and play Demon's Souls; a game which is well-designed, fair, and pays attention to more important details and atmosphere.",

After quite some time with this game I have come to give this review some more depth. The first section of this review will be for people that have never played a 'From Software' game before and the other section will focus on the controversy surrounding this remastered version  It`s difficult but when you start to come around at the fourth boss or so and get the hang of it`s gameplay mechanics, Dark Souls 2 will drag you into the world and keep you immersed for months. The world is rich with story and detail. The difficulty is always fair and when you finally take down that difficult enemy you have been analyzing for hours you get that satisfaction only DS can give you. From an RPG standpoint the leveling , gear, weapons, dialoug...basically everything is done with such class and confidence that it will be hard to find anything flawed. I know I sound like a fanboy but when a game comes around and gives me a whole new perspective of how I play and enjoy video games. you know it`s something special.  Even if you`re scared of the difficulty I promise you it will be worth it, if you give it time. I too was hesitant about playing Dark Souls in general but oh my how glad I am I did.  Now for the package itself. I do think it`s in general a bad idea to release a remaster in the timespan of less than 2 years. It`s a cash-in, although it was primarily made for the PS4/Xbox One users who got a terrible last gen version of this game. They will certainly experience a much bigger difference in both graphics and performance.   On the PC, the graphical upgrade is nice but DS2 already looked good to begin with. Only noticable change I can see at the moment is the lighting which has improved and actually gives the torch some purpose. With that said. DO NOT buy this remaster for the graphics alone. Not worth it!  Another controversial topic has been the splitting of the community and I do agree that it was a pretty ♥♥♥♥ move on Namco`s behalf. This needs to stop. On console it`s fine but on PC it`s different. There are no performance differences between the versions which makes the server split pointless. Alot of my friends have the original DS2 and I can`t play with them simply because of this travesty.  Scholar of the First Sin does come with all the DLC`s which I highly recommend. Go with the cheaper upgrade version for DS2 so that you can have the great Crown of Kings trilogy, if you haven`t played DS2 yet this is the perfect time. The best version by far , but not worth it if you have finished DS2 and the DLC before hand.   9/10",

Weird jumping monsters with undead looking clerics (and more ogres) in the flooded area?  The DLC locations fixed this though. The design was excellent and I really felt the lore through the journey.  Again, despite this, Dark Souls 2 is still one of the greatest games I've played and is worthy of the Souls' reputation. Brutal and beautiful.  BUT, if you are going to buy a souls game anyway, go for Dark Souls 1 or 3.",

Y'all know what Dark Souls is, so I will not spend any time to say obvious things about this game and I'll try to do a comparison between DS and DS2.  You know this is a Souls, you know this is hard. Isn't it?  Well...to be honest this probably is not entirely true: I found DS2 to be the easiest Dark Souls I have ever played. There are only 3 good boss fights, while all the other are trivial. Few traps. Few danger.   What about the level design?  In the first chapter all the areas were logically connected and there were a nice amount of shortcuts to bring you faster to the main hub. In Dark Souls 2 you have a teleport function that let you jump from bonefire to bonefire. This is wonderful, right? Wrong! Thanks to this now all the areas are randomly connected thanks to corridors/elevator, with no shortcuts and without that feeling of cohesion.  And all those wonderful characters? All gone. Only 3 characters are really well made, with a nice storyline and a nice quest (Pate for Quest and story, Lucatiel for story...well, can't find a third character right now ^^').  Most of Souls player says that this Dark Souls is the worst for this problems and other more, but I must disagree with them. This game has good things too, like a better gameplay. There are plenty of weapons, when on the first chapter only 2 weapons were actually useful. Your character's response from your input is really nice, with no random rolling or getting stuck on an invisible wall while rolling.   For this reason I do recommend this game. In my opinion those downsides are little things you have to bear to have a smoother gameplay.",

I haven't played a whole lot yet on my PC, but I have spent hundreds of hours on my console version of DS2. So uh, lemme get into the review here.  Pros: -A challenging and rewarding experience -The feeling you get when defeating a boss -A muultitude of ways you can choose to fight. You could be swift with a rapier, or slow and bulky with immense damage from a greatsword -You don't get your hand held throughout (unless you have a friend that is a pro and leads you through, but where is the fun in that?) -Pretty good PvP, if you can try not to get 'triggered' from the laggy cucks with greatswords that talk ♥♥♥♥ after they beat you because they are dirty little man♥♥♥♥♥s who can't get a good connection because their father is too busy downloading loli ♥♥♥♥ scat hentai -A pretty good Co-op experience, to boot. That is unless you get a ballista through the chest when you fight the pursuer because someone thinks it's funny.  Cons -Some of the enemy placement in SOTFS is just utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t -Invasions, but really only if you are new to the series and haven't prepared in the slightest -Wheelie Skeletons -Parrying is really weird compared to how it was in DS1 -I think I'm just putting random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at this point because I am biased  So yeah, buy this game and not vanilla because it's not worth it. Or, buy DS1 or DS3. A lot of people I have come across have told people eager to get into the series to stay away from DS2. I don't get why, it wasn't perfect but it isn't an abomination.   ",

The change in mob locations as well as the change of mobs in general is a refreshing feel to the game and can overall feel like a completely different game. The online is still filled with hackers, unfortunately I can't 1v1 someone without him going 200mph or backstabbing me across the map and teleporting me into the lava in the Iron Keep.  -Pros Game runs smoothly. Mobs like to overwhelm you and make you feel like a 2 year old like the good ol'days. Graphic Improvements appeal to the sense.  -Cons Prepare to Die. PvP is completely balanced and there are no hackers ever. Bosses cheese the living hell out of you.  Verdict: Great Game, Souls Fan 10/10 would buy again.",

I love that everything is about learning and getting better, and not about getting better gear as it is in every other RPG game. You have to be smart and always careful. Also, I love the level of little details like being able to use weapons in 1 or 2 hands, different weapons having VASTLY different playstyles and uses, the effects of gear on your roll speed, the effects of gear weight, etc. There is just so many little variables for you to play with and learn and customize in the way that you want.

Here's a simple statement: Dark Souls and Demon's Souls were never about 'difficulty'. It was about challenge. Dark Souls II literally spits on that statement and makes the game hard in the nastiest possible way.   I'll try to make my bitсhing as short as possible. Imagine that infamous Anor Londo Archer Bridge scenery. Now put two NPC dark spirits 'haveltherock420' who constantly respawns in the middle of these bridges. Archers are still there, bear that in mind. There you go. Your typical DARK SOULS™ II area. The problem is, the game tries way too hard to be DIFFICULT. It always reminds you that you're playing a HARDCORE game, where DEATH is pretty much inevitable. Dialouges (you're going to die, again and again bro xD), blood puddles (holy mother of god, there's WAY too many blood puddles, I wonder if they have a special ♥♥♥♥♥ing server for these), death counter, 'This is Dark Souls' achievement, list goes on. It also looks absolutely disgusting. I hate to do that analogy, but some of the locations look like they're covered in puke.  I played and finished this game on PS3 back in the day. I loved the first hours, but then things went downhill. I was suprised to find out that I'm not alone: the second installment is considered the worst game in the series. After two years, I decided to check out that GOTY-esque edition because I heard good things about it and I couldn't even stand these first hours.  I DO NOT recommend Dark Souls II. If you've never played Souls game, start with Dark Souls. If you loved the first one and want some more, give Dark Souls III a shot. Not as good as the first one, yet better than THIS abomination of a game. If you, by any chance, own PS3, do yourself a favour and play Demon's Souls.

I just beat it (and by beat I meant killed every boss including the DLC) and there are some things it improved on and somethings it failed pretty bad on. Just remember that this is my opinion on the game and it's quite long so just bare that in mind.  Pros Visually amazing combat is well done Online was well done in certain regards but I'll get to that later. There are poorly designed bosses sure but the ones that aren't poorly designed are extremely well thought out and worth while to take on there are more but I'm too lazy  cons It is insanely hard to co-op with friends on this game even with the name engraved ring me and one of my friends tried for hours on end with no luck A lot of bosses are lazily designed at bessed and down right horrible at worst. ruin sentinels skeleton lords twin dragonriders and my personal least favorite the blue smelter demon are just some examples of ways the game either reskins or just says 'hey, this boss isn't hard enough time to break out the old copy/paste.' your character heals SO GOD DAMNED SLOW. Yes I know you can level up a certain stat to speed it up but even then it is painfully slow to heal. iframes when dodging are almost nonexistant. (For anyone who may not know iframes are frames that you can't get hit when you're 'in' them they're active when dodging performing a riposte/backstab or if you been knocked down.   Now it may seem like there are more cons then pros so you may be thinking 'why by this game?' It is still extremely fun to play and I had plenty of good times with it.

            "review_text": "This game is probably the most disliked in the series by fans of the souls series, and I have to agree with many of the points raised by people who dislike this game. However, this is far from a bad game, but the first Dark Souls set such a high standard that it would have been extremely difficult to please everyone. But the game definitely still needs to be played, it has some really memorable moments and boss fights, and if you're into PvP it was definitely improved from the first game.  But I have to agree with a lot of fans when they say that there's definitely 'something' that's just missing from the sequel.  The world of Dark Souls 1 was just incredible, one of the best designed worlds in gaming, I can still go back and play the game now and still love the world, the atmosphere, the amazing design, I've replayed it so many times. The entire world of the 1st game felt connected, there were shortcuts and secrets littered throughout, however DS2 goes in a different direction. Instead of having the world feel 'connected', you will be warping from bonfire to bonfire a lot, which really takes something away from what made the first game great, and made the world feel natural and beautifully designed.  I remember finishing DS2 for the first time and having absolutely no desire to play it again, the only reason I'm playing it through again now is because of the DLC which I never got on console. I replayed the first game several times on console without any of the DLC, and played through it twice again when I got the Prepare to Die edition on PC. It was just an amazing experience that felt naturally challenging.  On the subject of challenge, Dark Souls 2 is definitely difficult, but it just feels 'forced' and very lazy at times, not to mention extremely cheap, and not in the fun 'lol dark souls' way, I mean the '♥♥♥♥ the lazy devs who made this dumb boss/mob enemy section' kind of way.  The first game actually never really made me frustrated, because the difficulty felt so natural, I knew I was doing something wrong. (Except for that ♥♥♥♥ing giant dragon bodies in bright orange lava section in Lost Izalith, which even the developers admitted was rushed and a mistake.)  DS2 has many areas where the developers just seem to get extremely lazy and throw in mobs of enemies, it doesn't feel challenging, it just feels frustrating and extremely cheap when you get swarmed by 5 or 6 large enemies in one area, it's a real motivation killer for continuing the game, particularly for a returning player who really just wants to play for the DLC. There's a difference between well designed challenge, and just throwing a ♥♥♥♥ load of enemies in a small room or choke point, and telling the players to deal with the developers laziness 'because dark souls'.  That's probably my biggest personal gripe with this game, the laziness of a few of the more frustrating sections.  But even with it's flaws, it's still a great ♥♥♥♥ing game, that I would recommend you should play at least once. Great combat and atmosphere, and when the difficulty is done well, it has that feeling of accomplishment when you do finally kill a boss, or get past that one area that keeps messing you up.  In my opinion, you shouldn't go into the game expecting it to be as good or even better than the first, because I don't think it is. But this game is really great in it's own right, and deserves to be played at least once.",

The Scholar of the First Sin edition adds many more enemies, a bit more story, and reduces some of the grind towards many of the harder to obtain armor sets and weapons. If you are a Dark Souls fan i would highly suggest picking this up, ESPECIALLY if you do not own any of the DLC expansions (Crown of the Ivory/ Sunken/ Old Iron King). If you are a new player looking to get into the game but feel you might need help, I would suggest joining a community and checking out the Subreddit /r/DarkSouls2.

Well, this is a sort of 'remix' version of Dark Souls 2, with slightly different and more devious enemy placement. It also seems to have all the DLC intact and is fully optimized for 64-bit systems and as a result, it runs PERFECTLY at max settings on this PC.  Alright, so let's assume you're new to all of this and have no idea what this game is. So imagine Ghosts n Goblins, but as an action RPG. Dark Souls 2 can be painfully tough, but extremely rewarding. It's ridiculously addictive and a refreshing change of pace from most mainstream titles that strive to handhold and pander to more casual audiences. Will you beat it? Probably not, but you'll definitely enjoy it, especially if you enjoy a more retro style difficulty that puts the skill of the player more to the test rather than your willingness to just grind in a given area until you're overleveled, which can't really happen anyway as you are limited to how many encounters you'll actually run into in a given area.

            "review_text": "Tough i still recommend this game. Im rewritting this review since a lot of time has passed from the last one.  First of all. Let's see the game as a sole game, not as a sequel.  Dark souls 2 is an excelent game with really good fighting mechanics. While other games are focused on combos and speed. Dark souls 2 is focused on timing and precision. That being said. the graphics are not really 'next gen' , more considering Scholar of The First sin is supposed to be. The main reason is the geometry detail. There is no really a lot of geometry in this game. Most of the geometry is made via tesselation, wich is basically 'simulating' 3d by giving lightning effects to ground. The texture quality, even on max is kind of lame. Enemy animation sometimes feel like they are skating on ground.  Hands down. Dark souls 2 strenght isn't in the graphical department.  The sound however, is a completely different beast. The sound is amazing. Specially the soundtrack.  The second weakness of this game are the bosses. They are definitely the worst thing about this game. And if it wasn't because of the DLC's included in this version. Most of the bosses would be terrible.  Now Comparing to DS1  +- The backstab concept in this game is different. Not better, not worst, just different. Instead of an instant backstab you make an animation. The problem is... The animation is too slow, and you will miss most backstabs now  -+The game relies more on enemy quantity over quality. And From teab B was aware of this. Since most enemies are way easier than DS1 if you fight them one on one. This isn't really a problem. But enemy placement seemed more sober in Dark Souls 1. Here they are sometimes all over the place, and sometimes nowhere.  -+The dual wielding system isn't clear, and it's not a big step up from Dark souls 1 , since you will require to sacrifice a lot of stats to use the special dual wielding stance.  -+While the netcoding was improved by FAR from DS1 There isn't a single really good PVP event. in the year i had this game I mostly fighted in the Iron Keep, since most pvp'ers and Dragons gather there. Leaving the PVP arenas almost deserted.  +-The gameplay is even slower than Dark Souls 1. The good thing about this, is that if it was as fast, it would be impossible to backstab anyone  +-The parry system is really weird, however is still playable if you time well.  -And that's the best i can say about PVP zones. The Rat is the worst PVP zone, and i doubt Dark souls 3 will be able to make an artorias woods copy so badly. I hope... The only reason you will find people in the bell towers is for the spell you only get there for the achievement. Otherwise it's incredibly boring. This is another pvp that tried to be like Artorias Woods. Not mentioning the boss.  -Agility: this is by far the worst idea of a stat. While most stats in this game are excelent, Agility wasn't necessary at all. Who wouldn't want Agility to begin with. You can't dodge anything, drink estus fast, or roll better. So why is this even a stat!?   -Soul Memory. one would expect that after NG+ SM wouldn't be relevant. You'd be wrong. Soul memory is the mechanic that once you get enough souls, you will see less and less people. A terrible match making choice  -Bosses. I can't grasp how lame the bosses in this game are compared to most Dark souls 1 bosses. Most of them are armor clad enemies. ReSkins or just stupid. the most original Boss is Demon of Song. But he's also the one that almost always will miss his attacks agaisnt you. Also. If there was something to surpass Capra demon as a boss in a Souls games in lame ideas. You have Congregation+Dark Magus, Skeleton Kings, and finally The rat royal vanguard. Wich is in resume a bunch of rats Between reskins you have. Sif reskinned as a giant rat, Ornstein reskinned as a silver Ornstein, Ivori king pet reskinned and cloned as 2 IVORY KING PETS, IN THE SAME GAME. Smelter demon, this time in blue, invaders... but now as a boss. Kalameth as the giant dragon from Shulva. And the Red firedrake, as small red firedrakes and a boss wich is the same enemy again.  -You lose your stamina too fast -You lose your durability too fast. I get it. Dark souls 1 almost never required you to repair your weapons. You will now, A LOT. -The navigation isn't as fluid as Dark Souls 1. While in DS1 most places ended up leading you back to Firelink Shrine. DS2 all paths end in a main boss and a dead end. Making the game feel more linear.Only The Ivory King DLC seems to understand a good backtracking. And in a certain way also the Iron King DLC. -While you can carry different rings it's for the most an excuse to make you always pick up the rings that raise your damage. -Most bosses rely on quantity over quality -You start with NO estus flask, to one estus flask and then you have to collect them back, up to 12. While in the beginning this is TOO punishing, for the end you will probably never use em all. You won't need them because tehre are now life gems wich are too cheap to get. The estus only being for emergencies -Every optional DLC boss except Sir Alonne. is terrible. They are not just bad. They are Really bad. And the path betweem them and the closest bonfire isn't more than red carpet over a bed with nails you will be forced to walk over and over. For what? A boring overpowered boss that is a reskin of something you already fought. Shulva had NPC's! Iron Keep , besides of Sir alonne, wich is awesome, had the boring Smelter demon, Wich is the same Smelter demon from the main campagin, but does more damage. And finally Ivory king had the 2 king pets... Wich are reskins of the pet you just fought right before you fight them.  +You can now carry 3 different weapons, wich is good considering you will sometimes need to change them before they break and 4 different rings.  +Better netcoding +You can always be invaded now. No matter if you are hollowed +There is now a penalty for being hollowed that isn't only not being able to summon partners. But also you know lose max life for every tim eyou died. Up to 50 % if your max health +PC version is an excellent port... For what it is , it's ok. +For better or worst. The game flow is more straightforward. It's easier to figure out what to do next since the maps are less complex +Most weapons are viable now. Except the joke ones. +You can break some chests in the fight. So you better be careful while checking for mimics. +most spells are rebalanced and were given better animtions +Lower loading times, atleast for the PC version.  At long term. DS2 is as good as DS1 and none of it's flaws hinders the fun of the game enough to call it BAD, exceptfor the graphics that have less polish. But without doubt the best first impression is given by dark Souls 1. 2 is a good follow up. But no matter wich one you play first. The one that beats here is DS 1. It's more polished for it's time. And the game really looked like it was pushing he console to it's limits. Dark souls 2 played too safe. Wich is understandable, but unfortunely it was also what made it stand behind the first game.",

I have not played the original Dark Souls 2 that much so I can't compare Scholars of the First Sin to it. Anyways, SotFS is a remix of the original Dark Souls 2, with different enemy &amp; item placements, changes to the level design and a new end boss. It comes with all the Dark Souls 2 DLCs. Controller is necessary because the Keyboard &amp; Mouse controls are still garbage.  When starting the game you can choose different preset builds to suit your playstyle, just like the first DS game. Same different types of weapons and spells as the first game too but dark magic is now a thing called Hexes. Bonfires serve the same purpose as the first game as well except your weapons/armor are automatically repaired if they're not broken and you can fast travel right from the start. one thing that's different is that enemies will not respawn from sitting at a bonfire if you've killed them too many times, esentially forcing you to progress instead of farming or grinding. However you can burn these things called bonfires aesthetics that will make all the enemies and most treasure respawn but the difficulty will be increased in that area to a NG+ level of difficulty. Joining the Covenant of Champions will up the difficulty too but will make the enemies respawn indefinitely.   The game plays a little bit more faster than the first game, movements are quicker, enemies are too. Takes a while to get used to at first but it's an improvement. The game is not without it's flaws though. With fast travel being accessible so early in the game it's very convenient but also takes away from immersion since you don't have to play areas through from the opposite direction thus seeing less of it. That's actually more of a nitpick I guess. A lot of the enemy encounters seem to be poorly laid out and there just to annoy you but with them being able to despawn, you can just brute force your way through an area until all the enemies never come back, eliminating the challenge.  After beating it I still prefer the first Dark Souls over this one but I still think it's an awesome game.",

For example, if you're stuck on one level, you always have the option to go somewhere else for now. If you're having trouble with a boss, the problem isn't that you need to grind or that you need better equipment but that your technique needs to be aultered. Yes, traps can kill you in one hit, but you will have warning. My advise? Talk to every NPC until every dialogue option is exhausted. The simplest of NPC's can give you items essential to progressing the story. Don't run to wiki as soon as you can't figure something out. This isn't the kind of game where you have to use the sandwich on the elevator to get the goldfish to talk to you; yes, there are puzzles and they are very solvable if you try. Pay attention! Learn when to dodge and when to swing, when to leave and cash out your souls, where to go to for upgrades, and so on.",

This game is still an amazing game to pick up and play. It may be difficult at times (looking at you Shrine of Amana) and you may get frustrated but at the end of the day; you know that you had a good time. The PVP is pretty good; yes there are people who take it super serious, but its still fun to mess around with. You can build your character any way you want whether that be magic, swordsman, pyromancer, miracle user, etc. The game has a decent character creator as well. This is the best Dark Souls 2 experience and is a good game to pick up if you are interested in trying a Souls game.   Pros: -Fun and interesting locations -Nice Charcter creator -Lots of options for character builds -TONS of items to collect -a lot of NG+ content (NG+ x10) -replayability  -interesting PVP -Lots of covenants -Co-op is possible -Nice Graphics -60 fps is easily achievable  Cons: -If you bought Dark Souls 2 + all of the DLC the amount of new content you will be recieving isnt really worth the $30 price point (assuming you upgrade your version which is kind of expected :x) -Terrible K&amp;M controls probably the worst I've ever seen   Price is kind of meh, I mean its an absolutely great game and you do get your moneys worth. I never bought the DLC for the base game so It was worth it for me. However if you bought all the DLC then it is only worth upgrading to the version soley if you play it for the PVP/Co-op experience that it has to offer.  Overall its easily in my top 5 games of all time and is a solid 9.25/10  If you're looking for a Souls game to try; pick up this game.",

            "review_text": "Although this review comes with a 'Thumbs Up' be aware that this isn't a wholehearted recommendation. This is more for people that played through Dark Souls 2 and are wondering if it is worth the money. Obviously if you are a newcomer then this is the best place to start considering it comes with all the DLC and a few minor improvements. Unless you are a newcomer to the franchise itself in which case you should definitely start with the first Dark Souls.  Scholar of the First Sin was announced immediately after the final expansion was released and I like many others was pretty irritated about. I purchased it recently on PC due to the sale although I also have the PS4 version as well. Having ignored it for nearly six months I feel I can look at this a little more objectively.  Whether this update is worth purchasing really depends on how much you enjoyed the vanilla version. Enemy placements have been tweaked, NPC summon signs and invasions are much more prominent and a few creative elements have been added in certain places (some of which are admittedly pretty interesting). There is also a ring in the game that allows you to control Soul Memory to a certain degree, although this is a band aid solution and doesn't really fix the core problem. Lighting seems to be improved and makes torches less optional in a couple of places but if you are looking for E3 levels of fidelity then you should probably keep moving. Lastly, a character very important to the lore makes multiple appearances. Speaking of lore, item descriptions have also been given the once over.   All in all, the game feels very familiar but also quite different. All the above mentioned tweaks and alterations to progression paths (you'll be using more Fragrant Branches of Yore than usual) make this update feel akin to a Director's Cut or Extended Edition bluray with all the added extras from the previous iterations. If you loved the regular game and don't mind starting from scratch (saves don't carry over) then it could be worth it. However the vanilla game has been updated via patch to include most of the features that aren't related to performance so it really does depend on how much you want the extra player count, slightly better lighting and enemy placement re-shuffle. If you weren't much of a fan to begin with then nothing here is going to change that.  So, should you buy it?   Newcomers... Definitely. Longtime Players... Yes, if you want to spice things up a little. But Not essential. Casual Players... Don't bother, you probably won't appreciate or care about any of the changes.",

At first you are weak and fragile and the game may seem impossible but keep going and you'll become an almighty demon lord wielding a lightning great dragonsword. People need to play this game.  10/10 would get rekt by giant dragon again  That was my original review. It really sucks. So I'm writing a new review after having beaten this game again and the other 2 Dark Souls games. Dark Souls may be my favorite game series ever. The way the games blend there presentation and gameplay into one is amazing. But I wanted to talk about specifics. Dark Souls 2 SOFTS is proably not the best of the trilogy. Its an amazing game but a few things do hold this game back from true greatness. (Dark Souls 3 is that true greatness in my opnion.) I just wanted tot alk about a few pros and cons that a player with previous expierence in these games might want to know.  Pros: -Still Dark Souls gameplay and environments intact -Tons of weapons -Tons of armor -Very expanded lore -Great environments -Many secrets -Pretty much all the pros of the last game -There is so much ♥♥♥♥ to do -Awesome Music -Fun as ♥♥♥♥ too play  The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t:   The Black Gulch. Seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking. The amount of poison statues is stupid. Unless you spend 5 hours smashing every statue you will get poisoned which is annoying as ♥♥♥♥.   Hitboxes. Omfg the hitboxes. Some enemies have made me scream ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at my screen almost every time I see them.  -Velstadt and his stupid bell hammer. -The Fume Knight (Funny Story: With an inch of health left the fume knight killed me by stabbing the air in front of him when I was directly behind him killing me.) -♥♥♥♥ing Mimcs. These guys will teleport grab and insta kill you by eating your face off if your not at least 10 ft away.  -The Executioners Chariot with his back kick. -Aava, Lud, and Zallen and their paw swipes.  There are many more examples and you will probably find them when you play.   Many of the bosses in this game are Gank Bosses. Some are ok, and some are annoying as ♥♥♥♥. (I'm looking at you Three ♥♥♥♥tards in Sanctum City). Seriously who thought that was ok. Some of the bosses in this game are borderline cheap just because there's two of them when one of them would be easy by themselves. And some of the bosses are lazy. Like remember Dragonrider? Well now there's two Dragonriders! Don't even get me started on Prowling Magus and the Congregation. Remember the Belfry Gargoyles in Dark Souls 1? Well there's 5 Belfry Gargoyles! You get the point.  Dissapointing ♥♥♥ Final Boss. Seriously Nahsandra and Aldia are so easy.  No connection to Dark Souls 1. Honestly the lore in this game is uninteresting because it doesn't really tie back to the original game and for the most part I didn't care too much for it.  Some covenants don't do ♥♥♥♥ and it makes them pointless and dissapointing.  SOFTS says it makes the gamer harder. Sometimes its real changes that add challenge. Like the Dragon being added to Heide's Tower of flame. But most of the time the game adds cheap difficulty by adding more enemies. It just becomes annoying.  The ♥♥♥♥ing reindeer. That whole run to the boss is anooying as ♥♥♥♥. Same with the killer Dragon Men in Dragon Shrine.   Ok so I blasted Dark Souls 2 a little bit but honestly this still one of the best games I've ever played. Even with all those faults the game is literally one of the best ever and should be played.  10/10 Would get lagstabbed by Fume Knight again",

This version is almost the same just enemies moved around and put more in some areas + other NPC (Dark Spirirts) spawn at some points and attack you, while its happening can other player also invade you if you are unlucky, and they show as red coloured characters and are called Dark Phantom.  You can either summon or be summoned as a Phantom, when summoned its about helping the Summoner in that world, when successful in helping you get lots of souls which are the games currency in basically everything, from weapons to armour and including leveling up, and everytime you level up a stat (Vigor, endurance, vitality and so on) the next level up will cost more souls. So you have to do alot of grinding in the game or go on to the bosses and get some from assistance of others or npc.  I havent reached the DLC areas yet but hear only good stuff about them. This version is visually updated also since its running on dx11. The original was in dx9. And I can see the difference and I prefer this one.  I recommend this game, first of all if you dont have the original and or have it but not the dlc, i bought this through steam sale when the price was low about 10 dollars to upgrade because i have the original.

            "review_text": "While I think that Dark Souls 1 in many ways exceeded Demon's Souls, Dark Souls II ultimately feels like a step backward.   The Graphics are Better, and there isn't any 'Dump' stat (Luck aor Resiliance) like the previous two souls games, but the game overall feels a little watered down from the tight design of its predecessors. The possible exception to this is the comparitively remarkable DLC, but said DLC is unfortunately locked inside a game where you absolutely must bring in a powered up - or underpowered - character to play them, destroying the developer's ability to properly pace the challenges the same way as if the levels were integrated into the main game.  There are several ways the level design falls short, and I think a deeper analysis would be appropriate, but for the sake of this short Steam Review I'll touch upon the two most glaring issues.   The first Level Design issue is that there are just too many areas where the layout is completely linear. The biggest sins are in the late game, such as where you literally run accross a narrow stretch of land in the middle of a lake flanked by sorcerous snipers, or when you enter a mansion that ends up just being a long hallway with optional doors on either side. There are GOOD levels, like the No-Man's Wharf (as short as it is) and the Depths, but in the previous games I think I could name only ONE area from each that could use a little more imaginative polish. With Dark Souls II it's more than half the game.   Incidentally, this lack of imagination also applies to the bosses. While some bosses like the Last Giant might have a story to tell, a lot of boss rooms with health bars are just glorified mini-bosses. I think giving them the 'boss' treatment drained a bit from the epicness of the title - and the simple design choice of just making them like the Vanguard Demon in Demon's Souls would have made the better bosses stand out a little more. Between the (mechanical) level design and these kinds of 'bosses', it makes Dark Souls II feel like it's stuffed with poor filler content.   Adding to this issue is the Second Level Design issue I want to bring up, and that's the thematic problem. Dark Souls 1 had a fluid and cohesive world to explore, where you could write a story just by the way things are connected. The first great obstacle you have to face is an enomous wall that would be daunting to scale even if that was an option in the game. The ONLY way you can get through it is by proving your worth and ringing the bells of awakening. Dark Souls 2 - the obstacle is a barely eye-level collapsed pillar, and you overcome it by going through a locked gazebo that opens based on how many souls you collected, and MAYBE based on killing 4 unrelated bosses. (If you don't believe me about the pillar thing, check it out for yourself.)  In Dark Souls 1, when you go to the 'lava level' you have to do so through Blight Town, then defeat a powerful pyromancer spider queen, and THEN you find yourself deep in the depths of the earth where the demons roam. In Dark Souls II, for some reason going up an elevator that's already in a tower IN THE SKY, for some reason this leads to a place surrounded by Lava. Could it be a floating continent? Well, that'd be cool, but no, because the whole story behind this place is that the King built a castle out of Iron and it's sinking into the earth... But based on how you get there, it has to be in the SKY! These are the kind of things that you might not have noticed... but your brain did. Personally I think the thematic level design also has a lot to do with the way this game just doesn't feel the same as the other two souls games.   But the DLC levels are GREAT. I wish they were the whole game, and I really think they're the reason I'm tipping this review to 'Recommend' instead of just giving it the thumbs down.   I haven't played Bloodborne or Dark Souls 3 yet so I can't make any comparisons there, but I still think I can safely say that Dark Souls 2 is a skippable entry. It isn't BAD by any means, it's just not the kind of quality that we should be demanding from From Software. If you buy this, make sure you play the DLC - though I couldn't blame you if you find yourself feeling a little burnt out by the game's main content - even with its few moments of brilliance.   Honestly though, if Dark Souls sequels are just going to be like what we got for the base Dark Souls II, then I really don't want any more Souls games.  3 out of 5",

            "review_text": "Now that I've finished this PC version of this game as well (had played it on the console before) I thought I'd write a review with what I like/dislike about this version/the game in general.  The SotFS edition adds some DLC areas/bosses as well as changing a few existing locations/monsters. Instead of finding some rather easy water trolls in the area before a certain bossfight, instead you'll find a smaller version of the 2-bodied flexile sentry down there which, if you don't expect it, makes for a small 'help' moment. I wouldn't say it made the game harder (like some reviews claim) but just a bit different. While on that topic, I still don't think Dark Souls 2 (or SotFS) is a difficult game. The bosses rarely use tactics that can't be dodged (which you'll learn right from the start to do properly, more so by normal enemies than bosses) and you'll become a dodge master before you've even finished the game. Sure, some bossfights take quite some time when playing with a different class (I've had more trouble with some of the earlier enemies than bosses or later game normal enemies) but overal it's not a 'hard' game. Difficulty doesn't come from giving enemies more health/let them do more damage, that just makes fights take longer. And once you get the hang of it, you'll learn to only take 2 swipes at a boss and roll away after the second hit instead of being cheeky and try to get a third off as well. Patience is the key with any fight.  So, if it's not an incredibly difficult game, why do you hear so many people (including me) become rather upset about it? For pretty obviosu reasons; it's a poor console port. Sure, you don't need to install mods (and risk getting banned from online play) in order to play on 60FPS, which is a blessing, but they haven't thought about a lot of useful things.  For starters, the key mapping. Yes, I've played this game from beginning to ending with a keyboard and mouse. Yes, I do own a controller and yes, I do know that makes some things easier, like pickign between a power attack and a normal attack (which when using a mouse means double clicking, which ofcourse doesn't work 99% of the time but instead you swipe a normal attack twice). That's more of an annoyance, but furthermore, a lot of keybinds cant be properly relocated to the keys you want meaning you'll have to use either your movement hand towards the arrow keys or you're aiming/attack hand in order to change spells/items, leaving you vulnerable to incoming attacks, which is critical duing PvP fights.  While on that topic, those don't work. At all. On consoles they used a steady server and for some reason the invaders always had a stable connection when fighting the host. On PC, 9/10 times it can't connect to the DS2 servers (aafter clicking 'ok' 3 times it sometimes managed to get a connection after all, which usually disappears after 15 minutes of playing and you can't reconnect without exiting the game) or you'll be fightingagainst someone that is either missing all their hits when they clearly hit (which is very nice for the invader but not so much for the host) or magic spells will go by you on your screen but still take away health as if hit. Making for a 'rather frustrating' Mirror Glass Knight battle.  So, with all these annoyances, why do I still thumb up this game? For its price you're not likely to get a more satisfying title. Yes, you'll only swear to punch the invader in the face if you ever see him in real life a few times and yes, you might smack your desk leaving you with a hurting hand but still, that satisfying feeling when you beat a boss, solo, after a bunch of tries is like no other.",

There are cheeky enemy placements (like Dark Souls 1) the lighting is significantly more like what was shown in the beta testing - meaning it's actually dark where it's suppose to be dark - almost all the textures have recieved a HUGE improvement in quality, and there is more story, which Dark Souls fans love to dig up.  However, I can not reccomend the UPGRADE if you already own it. It requires an entirely seperate download which takes noticably longer than the 'original.' Not only that, but if you're an achievement hunter like myself, it will reset all your achievements upon purchasing this version.

Reworked poise so that it isn't as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it was in DkS1. + Tons of customization - there are lots of armors and weapons. Feels a lot less restricting. Boss weapons also pretty much all have a unique attack. + DLC is great all around. Best bosses, best soundtrack, best level design, interesting lore that shines a new perspective upon the vanilla game; great items as well.  +/- Level design is all over the place. Some areas have some good vertical elements that adds variety with some cheeky hiding places for items - particularly Drangleic Castle and Earthen Peak However, most areas are just a straight corridor, extremely horizontal (almost to the point of being straight corridors) with no shortcuts or anything interesting going on like alternate paths.  - Story (or lore) is very disappointing. It's basically Dark Souls 1 with different names. Plus it has a lot of references to DkS1 (every boss soul basically contains 'this soul is reminiscent of a being from another time...' clearly hinting at DkS1 characters. It's just a nostalgia trip. There's nothing new here if you're looking for story. - Soundtrack isn't all that good. Only theme I remember is Majula and that's because it plays everytime you go there. - Enemies are placed to ♥♥♥♥ you in the mouth and frustrate you in some areas, instead of providing some challenge. Expect some unavoidable 1v3s (versus powerful enemies, not hollows) or worse. - Terrible world design manifesting in its disconnected world, to the point where it doesn't even make sense. You're in a swampy poisonous area, take an elevator up and you're suddenly in a burning lava covered castle.  If you're looking for more Dark Souls, it's worth picking up.

It doesn't solve any of the big issues that were massive turn offs of Dark Souls 2. Rather than trying to make areas more interesting, the developers simply added more enemies to make it 'challenging'. What you get instead is a fodder grind that drains your resources and time that simply makes large portions of the game tedious.   Most of the bosses remain boring, and borrow from the same mechanics or strategies as others. You simply need to block or avoid most attacks and you're rewarded with a single swing. This just adds to the mounting frustration. In previous Souls titles, you could weather attacks or create openings for yourself, but no such opportunities exist here. Many of the bosses you will encounter are either a generic humanoid enemy, or multiple bosses, often both. A lot of them don't fit the area they're in very well, which adds to the cluster that is the lore. Not to mention the massive hitbox issues that persist.  Online functionality is laughable at best. Hackers and packet filter users are everywhere and you'll often get invaded or invade someone with a decent connection at first but will suddenly be facing an enemy who teleports around and back stabs you from nowhere. The game is best played pretending these features currently don't exist. It's a shame too, because when the PvP match isn't against one of these people, they're probably the best part of the game.  In terms of mechanics, FROM has implemented many changes, most of which make little sense. They made all defenses weaker by drastically lowering stamina recovery while blocking to nearly nothing, and making base rolls worse. You now need to invest in a new stat, Agility, to bring the invincibility of rolling back to something worth while. Endurance from the previous game is now split into two stats. While this may balance the stat against others, when combined with Agility results in a large drain of level ups that feel pretty meaningless. In addition, weapon requirements and scaling feel very inconsistent, some of which don't make much sense. The high base damage of enemies combined with stats not increasing resistances makes armor simalarly feel worthless. It's a hodge podge of conflicted design, the game wants you to not sit back and defend all day but the bosses will only ever allow a single safe swing before harshly punishing you for the greed of a second.  Graphically, it's gorgeous. This version of the game runs very steadily which is a definite plus. Something to consider though, for some reason Lock Guard appears to be enabled by default. You'll need to bind a key to remove this.  It should surprise no one who played the previous games that the development team for this title was different. It shows in their complete lack of understanding of what made the series great. What we've got instead is a passable game instead of a brilliant one. Perhaps a good buy at $20 or less, but is not worth the current price tag.",

Secondly, the game is still great from what I remember (I bought it on ps3 when it came out but now i'm PC master race follower) and I have to say I enjoy the fact the multiplayer is now up to 2 invaders and 3 people helping you for a total player count of 6. The trolls you can do with friends or invasions are just plain crazy and fun.  Third, I've played this game for over 400 hours, I can tell you from experience that I'd seen about maybe 5 hackers in this game over the course of maybe 300 invasions. I actually think that's pretty good in general in terms of being a pretty safe game to play and these people do get reported an banned.  Fourth, It's a great value atm for the thanksgiving sale at 50% off and it includes all the DLC that came out with it so no one has any more weapons than you do.

The only real difficulty in this game is due to having your hands tied by cumbersome controls/animations, so imo it doens't really live up to the 'It's so challenging!!' hype. Any game could be called 'challenging' if you impair the player's ability to move.  Controls and UI are a crappy console port... even after binding keys to a sensible layout, the screen is still littered with the X-Box defaults (A, B, X, Y). Trying to do things like open the secondary gesture menu, or remove a spell from your attunement list with a mouse and keyboard require either hammering random keys on your board until one works; or consulting Google to see what other annoyed players figured out.  ...

[Minor Spoiler] The early vendor selling the Fragrant Branch of Yore gives you MUCH more freedom to choose your own path in this one. I'm enjoying that muchly.  I'm a bit disappointed in FROM Software though. They have been well aware of the 60fps durability bug and yet have not addressed it in this release. For those unaware, the game engine calculates certain things like jump distance, invulnerability key frames, and how much durability a weapon loses per swing based on the assumption of a 30fps game. FROM set the FPS to 60 for the PC and because these calculations were not adjusted it means you jump shorter distances, have fewer invulnerability frames, and lose weapon durability TWICE AS FAST. Its incredibly brutal, and can result in you losing up to 6 points of weapon durability for hitting a corpse! I had applied a patch called DS2Fix from a modder called eur0pa on the original DS2 and the return of this bug is especially painful. Since most of the areas seem balanced around the expected weapon degradation you basically need to carry 2 weapons, or 2 copies of the same weapon, to clear areas.  Anyway. I would wait to buy this until eur0pa fixes it. I'm going to be playing but I keep butting heads with that durability issue.. and repair powder is so expensive!",

Not quiet as unforgiving as DS1, DS2 is still pretty brutal with a large world, multiple paths to victory and a lonely melancholic feeling. There's no hand-holding here, traps are set to kill you, other players will invade to also kill you and if you walk into a deep chasm you'll be dead. Same goes for the towering boss monsters and the famous 'heavily armored knights on roller blades'. You can take only a few hits, restoring health costs a moment to use, blocking, dodging and attacking uses stamina - the fights are intense and probably the best melee in gaming.  The athmosphere is spot on from the beautiful graphics to voice acting and music, the sad dying world is perfectly captured. Unlike DS1 the sense of place and moving through enemy ground is diminished because of early waypoint teleporting you won't get lost easily or stuck in a deep dungeon. A hub town offers a safe shelter similar to the firelink shrine in the first DS.  Hints visible in online play where other players tell you of ambushes and secrets and help you with the bosses but also randomly invade your world to kill you. You'll actually see shadows of other players moving around sometimes or touch a blood stain and see how they died. Really funny and also frightening when you come to an area with many blood stains.  The game plot and history is not forced upon you but revealed in details like the placement of items, corpses and bosses, the item descriptions and selected pieces of dialogue with the mysterious persons you encounter. Excellent game design.  You'll die a lot but you can always train, try a different path, learn to use other weapons and movesets, eventually you'll succeed and it's sweeter than slaying cheap Alduin in Skyrim who falls in a minute thanks to overpowered PC . This game is not only about number crunching though there are a lot of them but about learning your moves and attacks in the first place. A light armor can even be more beneficial imagine that.

Sure, FROM did some mistakes with the dlc's (promising there would be none, pricing, etc), but the game itself does not suffer from this, only your wallet and/or trust in FROM.  As for the game itself, the combat feels fluid, the environments are pretty, and the feeling of finally beating that one boss after a hundred tries is the best ever. I love the gameplay, and the graphics are pretty good as well. There are lots of viable builds that you will discover as you play the game. I have put all my play time into my knight, but I have read a lot on reddit about pve/pvp meta, and it seems to confirm that there is no 'strongest' option.  There is a point about the gameplay that is negative. The game gives you very little information about available options. You kill a boss and pick up it's soul. You see that you can consume it for a large amount of souls, but in the beginning there is no way of knowing that you can get weapons/armor from it later in the game, leading to a lot of regret.  A lot of people on reddit seem to say that the first playthrough is the most fun because you learn to overcome greater and greater challenges on your own, while others would say the later playthroughs. This is due to overcoming the skill requirement and allowing you to do fun things like no block/parry runs and fashion souls (look it up). I cannot speak for either option though, as i have yet to complete my first. Still one of my favorite games so far.  Would reccomend to anyone who - Enjoys a challenge and does not quit easily - Does not tie the quality of a game to outside factors (See 1st paragraph) - Likes a wide array of customization options - Loves the feeling of mastery after FINALLY beating something they've struggled with for hours.",

My only issue with this game (both versions) there is a perfect game in here but it's been ruined by a few small things.  Like, Unessary stats like Vigor and Adaptability. In Dark souls 1 all this was tied to gear and Endrance so all these stats seem to be there for is to make it so you need more levels if the soft cap on all the stat were 30 I'd understand. What this means is your build is complete at level 150 rather than 100-125.  Soul memory... honestly all the game would need to fix this is an option in the main menu matchmaking decided by Soul memory or soul level and then twinking wouldn't be an issue and pvp builds wouldn't degrade. Ofc, they added Agape ring which just allows pple to twink agian making soul memory just an annoyance now more than a added feature /shrug. Personally I'd just remove it.  The last thing is an opinon thing and that's the way the world is connected, it really feels like they connected the area in such a way so the game would last as long as possible it would of been nice if they connected the areas in such a way you have say 2 routes to each goal meaning the game is shorter but all the content is still there and as you get to know the world you can choose the route most important to you.  Either way, game is good but for me it feels over designed I mean I don't think anyone thought 'you know what Dark souls 1 needs more pvp rules and more stats' but we got them with this game which spoiled what could of been a perfect game.

            "review_text": "Alrighty, after seeing all the polarzing reviews, I think it's fair I give out my honest opinion on the game. Thankfully, for all you Souls fan, it's a positive one. Initially I was pretty skeptical about the changes, especially towards the beginning, as there seemed to be quite a bit of enemy spam. However, while there is a lot of enemies, their placement wasn't there to be cheap, but rather more difficult and feel more like an army, as with the game's lore there was a battle thad taken place there.  Little things like that, are pretty consistent throughout this game, the areas feel more lived in and alive, and also the enemy placement is a LOT more exciting in many locations. There is a lot MORE enemies as well, so there's less 1v1 with easier enemies...but more with stronger enemies, which feels good, but very different from what you'll be used to.  Now for returning Souls players, there isn't THAT much that is new in the ways of content, there's a new enemy or two and a new boss fight....that's about it, but the with the new placement the game feels pretty fresh, especially after the first area, that is different, but not as dramastic as later locations are. Hell, Royal Rat Authority is a good boss fight now, who'd have ever thought that would be a thing?  I think I can safely say, if you're skeptical about the game, it's worth the money if you feel like re-experiencing Dark Souls II. It's different enough to surprise you and if you're getting into the game for the first time, the enemy placement really is awesome. Plus the game is quite long, especially for first time players.  A word of warning though, there is the Durability Bug and as far as I can tell wonky hitboxes at 60FPS. You can limit your frames to 30 FPS (It's not as disgusting as it sounds, honest) and these aren't issues, but they are worth noting, because it does break the game in that regard.

I am disappointed about a few things though: -16:10 and 4:3 resolutions are still not fullscreen (you get black bars at the top and bottom of the screen/aka cinematic mode, which I find really annoying). -Graphical improvements are just lighting, shadows and particle effects. Nothing more. In fact, I would say the original looks a little better overall in terms of the environment--the SotFS looks extremely too bright for me even with the gamma all the way down, especially in Majula. -The 60 FPS seems great, but the bug for faster weapon decay is there (your weapons decay extremely fast because of this bug. See the forums for more information about it.)  Honestly, it's not bad, but they need to market it as a Game of the Year edition and not a patch people have to pay money for--because it's more of a GOTY than a patch. I got this because of the DLCs and the hope that 16:10 resolutions, like 1920x1200 would be supported with a true fullscreen. Even though that wasn't met",

I've reported every cheater I've come across, but obviously something is wrong when the vast majority of these so called 'Hackers' all have the exact same thing going on in their steam profile... 90% of the time these cheaters only have 1 game (dark souls 2), have less then 5 or so hours in the game, and either no profile at all, or an offensive/provocative profile bio.   Tell me fromsoft. Tell me how you intend to fix this hmmm? cheaters were bad enough in the original Dark Souls, then in DS2 they gained new abilities, new ways to ruin someone's day. and in DS2 SOTFS they seem to be even worse!  I cannot recommend this game to anyone because Fromsoft is not going to fix cheaters. they made a slight effort with the 'softban' system, and it worked for... a day or so before people figured out how to LITERALLY STEAL THE GAME. softban doesn't work if you can create a new steam and just get the game for free, hack in all your stats and pick up where you left off in under 10 minutes.  Fromsoft isn't going to fix this game because they don't care. they made their profit and now they have moved on to new projects. I bought vanilla DS2 and liked it... a bit... and I even got all the DLC. hell, I pre-ordered the game along with all my friends! (I didn't get any of the pre-order bonuses mind you but that is besides the point)  If you don't have Dark Souls 2 yet, first off wow you are late to the game, and second off, Don't get it. DS3 is literally right around the corner, how about you just wait so you can go die in the new game. Heck, if we are lucky people won't figure out how to cheat within the first day!",

First of all it is not the same game, they sell you a 'remastered edition' where the graphics are not that good and are definitely worse than DSII with mods. Secondly instead of keeping a balanced gameplay they throw extra enemies in places where there werent any before. Sounds like fun right?  Well it is not, DSII was balanced, if you dared explore certain places you would get killed, yes, but you would get a great reward. As the game is setup now you will just face twice as more enemies, or an enemie that is due for when you are a couple of levels higher and say, yeah we made it more difficult, ♥♥♥♥ that balance that made DS &amp; DSII a rewarding experience.  It is not anymore about getting attacked by someone you don't expect, its about walking into arenas of enemies to kill. And all this taking into account you have already payed and played DSII, this means you won't be rewarded by the areas you'll encounter or the story developing. Instead you'll just lick your wounds twice as much as in the original gameplay to get the same rewards for an unfair ammount of money.  On the other hand, if you are a first hand player and looking for a challenging Dark Souls ecperience then go for it. You'll get the pain, the frustration and the rewards that definitely will make up for it.",

            "review_text": "If you've been eye-balling this game I'd recommend that you pick it up. It's not in your standard faire of ARPGs. This game does not hold your hand and it's a challenge for the sake of the challenge, and I love it.  Combat is almost puzzle-like. You need to learn and understand what each of your moves do and how to best use them. Then you need to learn what your opponets move set is and how to counter, parry, backstab, block, and generally move through their attacks.   This game is difficult in the sense that their is so many skills to master and so much to take in. Nothing is automated so you could potentially play through most of the game before you realize that different types of shields have differing movesets, etc. You could also go multiple playthroughs without fully understanding how your equipment load effects your stamina, rolls, run speed, etc etc. This game encourages trial and error. Whether that means falling off cliffs to see if you can get to a secret area, walking along stretches of wall and tapping your action key looking for secret passages, to figuring out whether poison works on what bosses. There will never be a popup saying go to this area next. It's all on you. Each time you die you also lose all your souls, which is a combination of currency and XP, with a single chance to go back and reclaim it or it'll be lost for good. You'll probably backtrack a lot trying to figure out what's next. The story isn't spoonfed to you. It's found through talking through each NPC's dialog, reading equipment descriptions, and observing the environment &amp; your enemies. If you kill the enemies enough, they respawn everytime you rest to regain health etc, they will eventually stop respwning potentially making an area easier. This allows you to farm for souls and equipment.  There is also a metagame referred to as 'fashion souls' among DS players. There is so much gear and equipment to collect, and potentially upgrade, that you can darn well look like whatever you like, using whatever weapons you like. Cosplaying is common.  Then you get PvP/CoOp. Co-op is done through leaving summoning signs or joining covenants that summon you to other players worlds (to aid them against PvP'ers). Co-op is helpful for getting through an area or challenging a boss. PvP is done with summoning signs, joining covenants that summon other people to your world or you to theirs (territory defense style), it's also done with items that allow you invade someone else's world. PvP/Co-op is useful for advancing levels in covenants which provide gear/spells, but it's also bring new dimensions to this game after you put in dozens of hours messing around PvE.  The Souls game all have a New Game+ mechanic. After you beat the game you can restart it with your gear, but everything is more powerful and difficult. DS2 has a mechanic that allows you to NG+ and area after beat a boss. There's a cap on how high it can go (I've never reached it but I've never tried to either), but I've seen people on their Original NG and having one or two areas NG+8. A quick warning, if you NG an area and then beat the game and NG the whole game, that area that has already been NG+ will roll over to the next difficulty (e.g. NG+ overall, but that one NG+3 will roll over to NG+4). Each NG+ will introduce new equipment and enemies (and more enemies).   There are still bugs in this game, and each time Fromsoft releases content they just add more bugs, much to the hackers delight. You can be invaded by people that hack anything from invincibility to superpowers to even having different skins. This causes some major frustration, especially for me. I don't enjoy people raiding me constantly that are doing it knowing I have no way to combat them. Lag can also be a huge problem (shut off that streaming radio), I'd recommend keeping yourself region locked unless you have a fast connection and an awesome ping rate. Fromsoft does rebalance gear from time to time.  This is the game to start with if you're just getting into the Souls series. DS1 is a lot more puzzley with even more back tracking and alternate things happening. DS2 also has a lot of mechanics that have been cleaned up since DS1. I don't know if I'd recommend the DS1 port, it wasn't done very well and the community is patching it. Steam did just remove the GfWL from DS1, so that's a plus.  I own Dark Souls 1&amp;2 on the PC and 360 as a referrence on how much I like it. Go buy it and enjoy!  SotFS is a game of the year edition of DS2. It contains all of the previous DLC, new enemy placement, better AI, harder enemies, increased graphics, and there are 32/64-bit versions of the the game. I think SotFS does more to prepare players for pvp. This is the stronger game between plain DS2 and this version, though some say the devs overdid it with what they did to the enemies.

To start off, Dark Souls 2 can be a bit too unforgiving, even for a Souls game. When the player dies, their maximum health is cut by a small amount, shrinking with every subsequent death after. It punishes the player too much for making mistakes, forcing them to scrounge around for Human Effigies in order to regain their maximum health.  Parries and riposte is more difficult to pull off in 2, giving a longer wind up time to the parry, and not allowing the player to immediately riposte. The whole system is so bad, I tried to avoid it as much as I could for most of my time through the game.  Now despite these faults, Dark Souls 2's gameplay is still farily fun, and still possesses some challenge, albiet not as much as the first, but enough to merit some fun. The game is even more gorgeous and impressive art wise than its predecessor, possessing more nightmarish enemies than ever before, and incredible locales. While the areas are more linear than before, I couldn't help but stop multiple times to appreciate the amazing detail that went into the areas.  Overall, Dark Souls 2 is good. Not great, not amazing, and no where near as good as 1. It's just not as difficult, and possesses wasted mechanics such as the parry and riposte.  8/10",

At original game, Hides Knight are scattered all over the places, from Forest of Fallen Gaint to Lost Bastille. But now, Hides Knights are at where they suppose to be, Heides Tower of Flame. Although you can also find a Hides Knights wearing Heide Knight Iron Mask at Upper Gutter. This is quite interesting due to the fact that all other Hides Knights are at Heides Tower of Flame, and this one guy wearing a different kind of helmet is at Gutter, where people throw things that they don't want to see anymore.  Another place is Brightstone Cove Tseldora, if I remembered it right, SotFS filled the army camp with actually armie, the Volgen Falconers. There is one interesting fact, a hollow miner is 'attacking' the wall, and there were 5,6 bodies around him, all of which can be found with Soul of Warriors and one Soul of Knight. Were the Falconers hired to investigate what was going on in Brightstone? You can magine a scene of a Falconer Knight leading his fellow Falconer Warriors checking up on this 'weird' miner, and was killed by him, or may I say, it. Speaking of 'Scholar of the First Sin', we can't forget the new NPC, as well the new BOSS, Aldia.  At original version of the game, I thought that the Ancient Dragon was Aldia himself emerged with soul of giant, because that Ancient Dragon only has two wings, so we can clearly cross him off the list of 'real ancient dragons'. Ok I was a bit off the topic there. The appearence Aldia, the Scholar of the First Sin gives the story of Dark Souls II a period symbol. At Dark Souls I, we get to choose whether to link the fire or create a new age of dark, but it turns out that those were just complete waste of time. Many kingdoms raise and fall, so are the 'Chosen Undead'. After 'us' in Dark Souls I, there were countless 'Chosen Undead' and 'Dark Lord', we were simply the begining of a never ending cycle of ages of light and dark. The choices of linking the fire or not are merely one choice, to continue the cycle. Therefore at the end of game we get to pick a different route, one that can jumps of the cycle, and look for a new road, one that is outside the cycle. Well, I think the overall story is great and attractive, although I haven't got the chance to look though all the new item descriptions, I will give at 10/10.",

Thoughts like these will be standard for players of the regular DSII. But nonetheless, except for the greedy moneymaking policy and the bad, bad port (you NEED a controller) this is a fantastic remix of the original DSII and really steps it up a notch. Only thing I'm a bit disappointed with is the new final boss, who is even weaker than Nashandra, since I had hoped they'd implement a fight that's worth the title 'final boss'.  Definitely recommended, I'm on my third playthrough right now",

My opinion is based on the fect 'Is this a good game' and it is definetly a good even a great game   If you nevr played Dark Souls 2 before then this is the one you should take now since it's enchanced a bit , it has all the DLC there and slightly improved Online Fetures ....but if you allredy own the Original Dark Souls 2 with all 3 DLC's its just not worth it , Scholar of the 1st sin just offeres too little for somone who has like over 400 h of gameplay time and a lvl 300 character too start form the begining ( especially since your save from DS2 wont work in scholar of the 1st sin ).As for the visuals ...well it has better lighting but iam not quite sure the textures all all HD now ...i mean my DS2 with ENB ecnhancment still looks better then this.  so in short IF you dident play Dark Souls 2 yet ...YES GET IT NOW !!! IF you allredy own Dark Souls 2 + all 3 DLC's then NO dont buy it , just keep on dualing on the Bridge with your Badass character just like your doing right now",

Excuse my English.  SOME SPOILERS AHEAD:  7/10 GRAPHICS : It will come a few frame droppings and some of the effects are bad, but most of it is great.  6/10 GAMEPLAY: They have really balanced it poorly, made it to hard in the beginning at some places, and to easy further ahead.  I have no clue where this lie about being able to play 6 people, except graphics and adding more monsters at some places.. not much have changed . Maybe I am missing it. Play it with friends, because honestly 60% of all phantoms (players) are just bad at the game. They make mistakes somebody at their level should be able to avoid. Like I don't know. rolling?? Also I am still wondering why some invanders can't take damage when they are being hit from 3 directions by people with large weapons. I won't say hacking.. but maybe.  I was so dissapointed when some of the DLC's became a cakewalk for me.. a crappy lvl 151 .The bosses are at times to easy, the first tiger boss is a damn joke to defeat even with NPC phantom, Furthermore they can never be like Demon souls or Dark souls 1, where you died again and again. I died mostly from invaders and being to tired to play. And why is defeating Venedrick (whatever his name is) optional??? Last boss Nashandra is so damn easy... it is rather poorly ported in one way, on keyboard it can become a struggle.  6/10 MUSIC: I love game music. But, It is not like on Dark souls 1 . I am sorry but it has perhaps one or two songs that are decent in DS2.  TOTAL SCORE : 7/10 - Not perfect, but OK..worth buying if you want a light challange. Not like in Demon souls or Dark souls 2 do..",

I, however, am here to say that this game is fantastic and worth your time, money, and lack of showering, Dark Souls will forever be my favorite franchise, and when bloodborne was fantastic to everyone but me, I was greeted with the warm solace of Dark Souls 2: SotFS. I'm never going to say anything against this series and out of the 4 released games (not counting different versions) this is far and away my favorite.   Is it worth 60$? yes, yes, 100,000% yes, unless you own dark souls 2 and all dlc already. (on pc. bc i had all dlc on ps3 and this is a huge step up.) Despite this, I still reccomend you wait for a sale, [given that im writing this on Chirstmas Eve that's not an issue]  Is it a good port? Now, Dark Souls I is meh without a mod. Dark Souls 2:SotFS is a great version to play. extremely well optimized to the point where i've seen my garbage build (745 GeForce GTX (not awful but it's running a newer game at max)) surpass 60 fps in certain locations and the game has never looked better.  Is this a good place to start the Souls series? Absolutly! I was a 'Dark Souls Virgin' and didn't know the ways of legends never dying and not being casual, until i saw the light of this game. (in it's base state on ps3). This is possibly the easiest and most beautiful entry in the franchise to the point where I lost count of the times i just stopped and took in the area and the soundtrack (special shoutout to majula's track and reveal. (bright sunshine contrasting a dark cave...it's great) Good luck and good hunting. and may the odds be ev... wait..sorry...wrong franchise.",

Negative: Dark Souls was a satifying game, from being one of the best RPG dark fantasy I ever encountered, it also added hardcore difficulty to the level which brought real challenger for ones who feels bored about casual games. Finishing bosses actually feeled accomplishing. In scholar of the first sin, its not hard, its plain annoying and a real pain. There is nothing enjoyable about fighting a boss who is programmed EXACTLY the same as Sif but in a different skin. The game is also not user friendly.

The atmosphere, the level design, the awesome design of the bosses, the cool weapons, the realistic fights and the sick hardness of the game sucked me in. It wasn't perfect the pc and even the console port were really bad, the multiplayer servers didn't really worked, there were chain-backstabs, Giant Dads, and this game is not something like beginerfriendly.  When Dark Souls 2 came out, I played with it, but it wasn't just as good as the predecessor. After 30 hours i put down DS2, and played with other games (for example DS1). However i got the Scholar of the First Sin edition to PC and i realised what the beatuy of this game. The multiplayer. However, the bosses weren't as good, the NPC-s were not so memorable, the map design was linear, the whole game got slower, and the you don't have that munch control of your character as you used to had in DS1. But the Coop is still fun \\[T]/ and the PVP is brilliant. I like it so much. The diversity of builds and the tactic and skill oriented fights are entartaining. It is really fun to play some iron keep pvp, or invading casuals in Frozen Ellium Loyce.  The DLC-s are awesome. I can say they are than most of the areas of the original ds2. If you want buy DS2 buy the SotFs edition, because of the DLC-s, the bosses are epic, and the map designs are great, and you can find very unique weapons and armors there.  In conclusion DS2: SotFS is a pretty good game with dozens of hours of content (i already played more than 200 hours whit this game), a pretty cool multiplayer and this is not as hardcore as it's predecessor. I can absolutly recommend this game to anyone who likes dark fantasy or mediaval themed games with a mostly realistic fighting system.",

DARK SOUL II: Scholar of the First Sin  9.5/10  After 173 Hours in Dark souls 1 150Hours on Dark souls 2 Xbox 287 hours in Dark souls 2 Pc And 100 Hours on Dark souls 2 SoTFS I think I sould Finaly review the game.  Dark Souls 2 is a arpg game where your go on an adventure and explore a mysterious and dangerous world.   You will die often. But its okay.  The game want you to learn from your mistakes and will reward you for playing carefully.  The difficulty of the game may seem high for new players, but the more you play it, the easier it get. There is also some in-game mechanic that allow you to decide how hard the game will be. Things like classes, or conveent will change that.  A Melee character may struggle where a ranger or a mage could easily destroy all his foes. And Some conveent will allow you to receive hel from Npc/ Other players. While other will make you a target or will disable help from others.  There is a very high amount of weapons and armors. also Magic, Pyromancy, Miracles, Hexes. All of these options give you infinite combinations possibilities.  You could be a Heavy Two-handed sword mage, Or a Fireball throwing Theif with a dagger.  The choices are infinite.  Sadly, some weapons are outright better than others and while they don't really disturb when you clear the main game. It can be a problem when you want to play only to pvp. You will often see people all using the same weapon, for instance a katana, because it is simply the best option to win.  But in Dark souls. Skills Beat Stats. So a skilled played should not fear an overpowered build.  Story in darksouls is scatered and vague. Most of the explanation you will get it from Item description in your inventory. It doesn't shove its story down your throat. You follow it if you want. and ignore if you don't care about it.  TL/DR:  Pros: -Combat -Customisation (Weapons choice/ Build) -Story -Ambiance -Pvp  Cons: -Lag ( Lag will ruin your pvp experience if you have alot of it.) -Hackers (White only annoying as they can't really stop your progression of the game. Getting killed by someone without skill is always a mood killer) -Pvp Imbalance -Linear ( Dark souls 2 is somewhat more linear than DS1 or bloodborne. It fell like the game was made to appeal to a more casual audience. You are still free to go on multiple path at the start of the game. but it seem every path you take is a straight line.)",

There are still a few beasties to be found, but they are not the most memorable features. There are a few adrenalin pumping and 'Impressive' boss fights with fore mentioned knights that harken back to the duel with Artorius in DS1s expansion. While the combat is to die for, you will suffer imesurably (from time to time) with hackers and lagg in pvp. From time to time you won't be able to tell the difference. Those of us who play DS2 for the pvp do not let this discourage us. PVP in this game is a dance and its beautifull when it works. The same dance is taught through some epic boss fights as well, better experienced with friends and voice chat. The 'Name Engraved Ring' will allow 'nearly' exellent coop. You just have to follow a few rules concerning when and where to summon your friends and you can experience this adventure in a party of four. I have hundreds of hours in this game, it is my favorite. Play it and join us all in DS3 when your ready to do it all again.",

So a big thumbs down for the company. This is the kind of company practices that lead people to pirating games (and for these type of companies I would encourage it…).  I originally decided to never buy this game since I already had DS2 and buying this would cost 25€ (discount price for owning DS2) but holiday sales brought that down to 10€ and since I didn’t own any DLC I thought that was a good deal and got it for that price, so I recommend it for players that own DS2 without DLC but get it on sales. In my opinion the DLCs don’t justify the price of 25€.  The game itself is good, well everyone probably knows it by now, so I recommend it to new players too. It’s not as well designed as DS1 was (they got lazy on this one) and a lot of the bosses are cheap knockoffs from the first game but it’s still a good game, better that most games you will find nowadays. It still has that “arcade” feel to it that I very much appreciate.  FromSoftware, BANDAI – 0/10 DS2 SotFS – 7.5/10",

The default controls are about half a second slower on the PC, because strong attacks are triggered with a double-click, and the game waits to see whether you double-clicked. This is ridiculous in an action game and clearly has to be changed, so the first thing you have to do is remap your controls. The game provides a 'disable double click' option that makes clicks work immediately, but when you restart the game, this option is ignored and you die, unless you remember to toggle the option every time you restart.  2. When you hover a mouse over the top half of a menu item, the menu item above it is selected. So you have a 50% chance of clicking on the wrong menu item and consuming an item that you meant to give to someone, unless you train yourself to ignore the location of the mouse pointer and go exclusively by what's highlighted, which is difficult.  3. The interface tells you all over the place which controller button to press to do what, but it is impossible to have a keyboard key that merely emulates a controller button. So while the game will tell you to press Y to toggle actions, there is no way at all to toggle actions using mouse/keyboard.  There are many other issues that I won't bore you with. Saying that this is a PC game is essentially fraud. Keyboard and mouse controls were a half-♥♥♥♥♥ afterthought, and are literally the worst interface I have ever seen in decades of gaming and computer programming. Do not expect to be able to play this game with a mouse/keyboard.",

It's a mess. The hitboxes are somehow more broken than Demon's Souls or the original to the point of enemies twenty to thirty feet away from me still somehow managing to register a hit, and on many enemies it counts nearly every frame of every animation they have as 'blocking' frames where you can't properly damage them. There are also bountiful places to get stuck on the level geometry and the occasional unkillable enemy that doesn't reset and become killable until it kills you, along with having an attack registration rate of around 75% (meaning, when counted and tallied up, roughly 75% of attacks that hit an enemy register as a hit. this varies between weapons, but is still a dismal number.)

Unlike Dark Souls this game does give you some direction into where you need to go and what you need to do.   The combat is as good as ever, although there is now a larger selection of weapons to choose from that will satisfy any play style.   The game has a fantastic atmosphere with music that just sucks you in.  The visuals are not great but the exellent level and weapon/armour designs are phenomenal and make up for the blurry ground textures.  The game also runs very well, never once did the framrate drop bellow 60 (the stability of the DS games has usually been a problem)  So in short, yes, you should buy this game.",

            "review_text": "I'm basing this review on having never played the DX9 PC version. Previously, I'd played through the game on the Xbox360. At that time, I was a little sad for DkS2; I thought it was good, but compared to DkS1 kinda, well, boring. So, I was kinda a bit unsure on whether I should pick this up now I've dropped the Xbox for PC.  First impressions, it's better. Ignoring the graphic upgrade for the moment, which is what I'd expect from a PC game in the first place, I've already had more fun playing this version in two hours than I had in playing the origional version in, god, 80 or something. It's mostly little things, like the enemy AI seems better, the small changes to placement, the fact that, yes, there are some gank squads out there, but so far I've yet to run into one that feels unfair. There are some nice little environmental changes (additional gunpowder barrels, i'm looking at you) that you can use to your advantage. It just feels, in terms of gameplay, more what I'd expect from a Souls game.  The game runs fine, as well (better than DkS1, which, you know, is hilarious) and is nice and smooth right out of the box, although I notcied some graphical and audio stutter in the opening cutscene. Nothing horrendous, but it was eyebrow raising.  So, the graphics...... I'm sure that the DX9 version is just as good with mods, but this looks fine out of the box. The lighting still isn't as lush as that promised by the infamous E3 demo, but there are now areas that are pitch black. It's funny, but I never thought I'd be happy to not be able to see what I'm doing. I'm looking forward to seeing how the gutter plays now (something else I'd never thought i'd say).  As for the durability bug, yep, that's ~very~ obvious. Oddly, though, I don't mind it. Even weider, I actually prefer it. Having to consider the weapons you have and making sure you keep backups adds a nice, if unintended, twist in play.  Overall handling, the game feels slightly harder, slightly weightier (compared to the floaty experience i had on the 360, anyway), but also oddly fairer. Even though I played it death last year, it now feels more fun, more interesting and pleasantly fresh.  In short, I'd like to totally echo what everybody else has been saying. This is how the game should have been released in the first place (hell, the lush lighting in E3 version should have been the aim for the PC), and if you've got the DX9 version with all the mods and DLC then you've really got to ask yourself if it's worth it. However, if, like me, you've only played it on last gen consoles, or you've never played it full stop, or you bought it in the xmas sale and haven't picked up the DLC yet, then have no qualms about picking it up.  Although, do yourself a favour, and drop brightness in game down to 0.  9/10 - would die before creating character again.",

The horrible equipment degradation.

Who's bright idea was this? I can barely swing a sword 10 times without it saying its almost broken. Sure you can get them repaired at blacksmith, but i don't feel like going back and forth and having to keep several spare weapons because these programmers decided to program something like this in BADLY. There's a ring which you can get which slows equipment degradation but even then its still bad, AND I have to give up 1 of my 4 ring slots to stave off slightly this horrible ultra fast degradation they've programmed into everything. NEARLY GAME BREAKING.  2. The auto lock on in this compared to dark souls 1 is DREADFUL. You feel 9/10 of the time like you have to be right UP on a guy to lock onto him, this can be a real pain in the A$$ if youre a magic user who depends on shooting your magic long range before guys can be right up on you in melee range. I found a dex char with bow was way better at ranged than a magic user, because of the ability to go 1st person with bow and 'snipe' witha cross hairs. Why didn't they just put in an ability to do this with magic user?? It also will mess you up in the middle of fights with several monsters. You'll have 5 or 6 guys coming at you at times, and when you push R joystick to autolock on nearest guy, it will lock onto a guy further away on the OTHER side o fyou instead of nearest guy at times. This can cause you to get hit and messed up alot of times when it shouldn't have. Annoying.  3. Weapons and spells at times seem WAY too slow. Uh what's point in using a weapon if by time you swing it you've been hit 5 or 6 times and died by something with a faster smaller weapon? Yeah i know they 'balance' it by giving bigger weapons way more dmg, but at same time, should the guy REALLY hold the weapon out that long if he thrusts it, has stamina left to roll away, and yet game FORCES you to finish hitting animation even though you're trying to get out of way before enemy can counterattack, which causes alot of deaths. Spells are the same as well, if a guy is right up on you, forget it, switch to melee weapon, by the time you cast your spell he'll have killed or interrupted you half the time. Yeah i know, you can raise attunement and intelligence to make you cast spells 'faster'. I played first game with a sorceror though, and 90% of my points were into attunement and intelligence, yet by the end of the game, with over 50 in both stats, I felt BARELY any difference in cast time and was STILL getting interrupted by guys when i'd start casting a spell with them a good 10-20 feet away. The spells don't stagger barely ANYTHING. I feel like they really nerfed casters in this, especially sorceror, as so many monsters are magic resistant/don't get staggered by huge magic missiles hitting them, which seems so ridiculous to me.   4. The level up is different from DS 1. You can't level up at any bonfire. you have to go back to this town which pretty much acts like your hub to all the zones in the game, where you have to talk to a girl BY the bonfire to level up, and are given the SAME long monologue every time by her, 'CHOSEN UNDEAD BLA BLA BLA SEEK THE GREATER SOULS ' yeah okay lady, i got it the first time we did this, can't i just open up the menu to level up instead of talking to this woman after the first time she gave me this spiel? People making this obviously didn't care enough to smooth stuff like this out and it really takes away from the immersion. Would it have been that hard to make bonfire the level up place like the first one? Were they trying to differentiate this game from first? I don't know all i know is that this 'feature' is annoying and adds several min. who knows maybe HOURS to your game time when you'd rather be doing more constructive things...  5. I will illustrate another thing about weapons by talking about one in particular: The halberd. This weapon says right in the description something along the lines of 'This is a cross between an axe and a spear, it can be swung like an axe, or thrust like a spear.' Um okay that's great only thing is, whether you hold the halberd 2 handed or 1 handed, strong or regular attack, it ALWAYS swings like an axe, either over head or sideways, or the guy spins around which looks dumb with it. And the point i'm illustrating is this, what's the point in having so many weapons if only a few of them really are worth using, and the rest have animations that are so long and inefficient? There is literally no reason to use the halberd its awful, and there are a few other weapons like this that you'll be like 'wow what is the point of EVER using this?' There are NUMEROUS spells you will use and be like, um okay what's the point of this. Examples: Soul Geyser and Soul Vortex. I put soul vortex up and used it a couple times, at POINT BLANK RANGE on enemies, it did NO DMG to the enemies. Is the spell bugged? i don't know but the spell sucks and its only 4 casts. Soul geyser. Shoots a bunch of 'homing' soul energy at a target, problem is, only 2 casts of this spell, doesn't do better dmg than soul spear, and the spell most of the time i saw it if an enemy barely moved it wouldn't hit. You might as well just stock up on more soul spears and greater soul arrows than use this crappy spell.  K well that's my review, if you can stand all this annoying stuff, go ahead pay 50 bucks, i wish i'd waited myself. Have a good gaming experience.",

            "review_text": "So I just finished the game and I have to say, it was really awesome but, there is one major thing that really bothered me throuout the whole game, but before we get onto that, let's point out some really neat things about Dark Souls.  As someone who is new to the Dark Souls series I was really surprised by some aspects of the game, for example the way they implemented the really helpfull messages which you can leave on the ground to help other players get through the game without dying as much, I found myself in numerous situation in which I would have died if it wouldn't have been for the messages on the ground. Another really cool thing is the statisfaction you get when beating a boss, it is really awesome to watch your 'Soul Counter' go up in digits as you sit there with sweaty hands and a pounding heart, just reaching a checkpoint (which is called 'Bonfire') is so statisfying as well. Besides that I really loved the way how FromSoftware delivered the lore of the game to the player.  Nevertheless I have to say, I wouldn't really recommend the game, due to its lack of exposition, FromSoftware does a really bad job at explaining the games mechanics, while some may say that, that just adds to the difficulity of the game I have to strongly disagree with them. An example for the lack of expostition is that, I bearley knew that there was an upgrade system in the game, I was comepletely clueless I just ran around, died a lot of times and just gave up untill i realized that there is an uprgade system in the game. Another example is the way they explain the 'weight system' of the game, which they pretty much don't, I was really confused when I got some new armor and put it on just to see myself trying to roll and fail, because my load was apperently too heavy and it didn't even reach the 100% mark, after doing a little bit of research I realized that the weight system was seperatet into four quarters, which I don't want to explain, but if you want to know for yourself  Here you go  [darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com] . The list goes on and on, but maybe it's my fault and I just missed something in the game which explained all these things.  Thank you for reading, have a good one.  PS: If you disagree with some aspects of my review, please leave a comment telling me why, that would be really nice. Since there are already people downvoting my review.",

        {
            "review_text": "Before I begin, I would like to join the chorus: COULD THE ESTUS DRINKING TIME BE ANY SLOWER? Seriously...  I should preface by saying that I have played and beaten the original Dark Souls and its DLC. I thoroughly enjoyed that title but this go around felt very different. The hours spent on the two weren't terribly different, but this game felt twice as long and half as enjoyable. Don't get me wrong. I wouldn't say that Dark Souls 2 is a BAD game, it just doesn't live up to the glory of the original and suffers from some poor design choices that really make parts of the game a chore. I think those who played the original will still get something out of the sequel, but those first entering the Dark Souls universe would be better served starting at the beginning of the series. Fighting mechanics have been improved (spare the awful hit-boxes) but new players won't be missing out on anything by passing on this one. Dark Souls 2 suffers a variety of flaws that alone would be tolerable but put together make the game fairly boring and sometimes downright miserable.  My biggest technical problem was the extraordinary lack of human effigies in the game. I never understood the purpose of humanity in the original title and so never used effigies. After learning that one could summon assistance with bosses by using them I was pleasantly surprised by how much more fun the game could be with a little help. Being hollowed-out also came with a health penalty that could be really detrimental at times. So with my new-found knowledge of effigies I began to use them often only finding out later how rare they were. The rarity of effigy drops didn't bother me at first because I figured vendors would surely sell them along the way. Problem was: vendors only sell so many before they are sold out for good. Just farm them from enemies that drop them in the field, right? That would work, except that after killing a particular enemy a certain number of times the game stops spawning it forever. You can work around this with bonfire ascetics but the increased difficulty of the area is a cost that far outweighs the benefits. The fact of the matter is that the health penalty of being hollow is far too great in this game and only serves to frustrate the player. The game is already hard enough. The developers should have made buying effigies a persistent option and just made them really expensive.  The lack of interesting environments and atmosphere was also a perpetual drag on the game. The original Dark Souls had a number of places that were really beautiful and awe-inspiring and the areas had a nice sense of scope, size, and cohesion that made sense. Dark Souls 2 is a patchwork of locations that are mostly uninteresting and offer little to no reason for return. There are no vendors, side-quests, or NPCs that make returning beneficial, so most are drive-through areas that clearly did not receive any thoughtful consideration from the devs. Some area transitions, like the one from the final elevator of Earthen Peak to the entrance of the Iron Keep, were just plain bizarre. Exploration of the world and the slaying of optional bosses doesn't yield much reward to the player either which is particularly disappointing after being brutalized by an area like the Frigid Outskirts. Touching on this point, the lack of NPCs in this game made it feel all the more hollow. Part of the charm of Dark Souls was its characters like Sir Onion and Trusty Patches who really rounded-out the game and gave it that dash of humor that was sometimes desperately needed. Their voice-acting and scripts were really fun and memorable. Dark Souls 2 is completely devoid of any interesting NPCs, save the Emerald Herald, who the protagonist rarely has any meaningful interactions with. My one hope in the game was to at least see some grand development of the Emerald Herald's story, some big animated ending that included some resolution for her. But 'Alas, nothing happened': we have about 3 short dialogs with her through the course of the game with no mention of her in the end. Epic. Disappointment.  With no unique plot developments or interesting NPCs the game comes off as just a poor carbon-copy of the original game and this doesn't just apply to the story. While some of the bosses you fight along your journey are fresh many are just cut-and-paste from the original Dark Souls. The Belfry Luna gargoyles are literally bosses right out of the original game. And although both are optional the game includes two nearly-identical fights with the Smelter Demon boss. The bosses of the Iron King and the Ivory King DLCs are true to the original vision but the base game bosses are weak and unmemorable for the most part. The battle with the Ivory King, which involves the ability to hire four knights and summon two spirits to assist in a group battle with the boss, was truly epic in contrast. I really wish we were given more refreshing battles like that. More group-oriented activities would have been much-appreciated and offered the players something truly different. On the boss side of things, I will give the devs some credit: The battle with the Fume Knight was exceptionally hard and the duel with Sir Alonne nearly made my chest explode. Good work.  But what was most damning for me was the general lack of direction in the game. This was tolerable in the original Dark Souls because it was a much smaller and cohesive world; if you poked around enough you would find where you were supposed to go. The world of Dark Souls 2 is much larger in scope by comparison and the DLC worlds make it even broader. I myself spent several hours in the Brume Tower after finishing off the Fume Knight having NO idea where to go to next. I couldn't find the last smelter wedge to kill the last Ashen Idol and knew it had to be somewhere in the Brume Tower. Turns out: I was wrong. After a few hours of wandering I finally resorted to consulting the internet for direction. If a seasoned video game player is doing this in your game you know you've failed royally. There is no indication that there is nothing to do in the DLC areas when you finish off their bosses and the fact that finishing them does not affect the story or gameplay is quite a disappointment.   On top of all of this the DLC areas are locked behind doors strewn about the world. Yes, they are locked. Where are the keys, you ask? They are hidden in random places in the world as well. The dragon talon required to open the Crown of the Sunken King is hidden behind a door that itself is locked by yet ANOTHER key hidden in ANOTHER hidden area. What the ♥♥♥♥ is that about? Why on Earth would you hide access to these areas and offer no leads to finding their keys?  I would love to go on about the empty story that I just stopped trying to understand about half-way through the game, but the small amounts of muddled history and plot leave hardly anything to comment upon. The 'story' is a tedious, poorly-developed afterthought. Enough said.  When I first finished this game a few days ago I didn't realize how much I didn't like it, but after writing this review I came to realize how many key areas this game fell short on. The empty ending cinematic felt like a real slap in the face after having sunk so many hellish hours into this game. I feel like I've put more effort into this game than the developers did. I can't recommend this game to new players of the series. Stick to playing the original for now. I haven't played Dark Souls 3 yet, and I've heard it's better, but this game has left me wary of trying it.  Oh, and whoever designed the Frigid Outskirts: I hope you get hit by a bus...",

There are also no tanks or aircraft anywhere in this game either which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, who cares about swords and shields and ♥♥♥♥ like that anymore?   Second of all fromshit who are the developers of this game forgot to add in actual enemy variety to this game. There are no people of different race from me to blow up and there are no countries to ruin in the name of freedom, wtf? All you fight in this game are zombies and knights and that's about it really. I'm so bored of fighting the same thing over and over again, I wish fromsoft would take a ♥♥♥♥ing hike over to activision and see how its really done instead of hiring a ♥♥♥♥ing potatohead to design these characters.  And the last thing I wanted to mention is the ridiculous story that makes zero sense whatsoever. There is an opening cutscene of the game which shows this random ♥♥♥♥er waking up for no reason and then going into some house and talking to people? Wtf where they thinking, this is probably the most boringest ♥♥♥♥ i have ever seen in a video game. After that house section you go down this alleyway until you get to machula and talk to some people? when you press a on these people they talk to you for an hour, at least in this game you have the option of cutting they're ♥♥♥♥ing heads off. After you kill these people because they are boring as sin you go down this little tunnel and face a door which you cant open. Fromsoft forgot to finish their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and instead put up a door that you cant get through, thats seriously all you get for 60$ of complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  In conclusion  This is probably one of the worst games i have ever played in my entire life i give this game a negative 0/10 worst game ever.",

Okay first, I didnt play too much, about 4 hours on my account and 10 on my wife. Is it worth ? It's worth, player database will transfer over SOTFS version anyways eventually so you wanna be there and prepared for PvP. If you dont care about MP side, then play your regular version and enjoy. Changes are relative and you are not missing anything which would increase or ruin your experiance if you are new to the game.  In terms of graphics (keep on mind I never tried ENB mods or any other), there is no difference at all. Literally, perhaps some deflections from Sun but that is pretty much everything. Some areas are darker and that is exactly what we needed in original game. Torch will be required if you are not brightening up too much your screen then normal.  Huge change for me so far is AI. He is not smarter or harder, not at all. Random AI is added to some locations, some are missing and placed in same area but with suprise factor. So even if you know game you are gonna feel that devs are trying to get you from behind so you are going to check most of the corners when you dont see well known enemy ahead.  I feel like that in begining in couple areas there are WAY TOO MANY enemies if you are going dexterity build with 2 weapons, shield is like 'must have' in some situations if you dont want to break everything around.  So overall: + Changed locations for AI + Suprise factor for experianced players + Darker Areas + Increased number of AI + Changed locations of NPC  - Same graphics - Separated community (its good for profit but bad for community) - Perhaps not worth 14/24euros if you are expecting drastic changes. - We cant gift upgrade to our friends (so if you dont have money/card you need to recieve full SOTFS version of 40 euros)",

Not being welcome to the idea of paying for the game again, I simply shrugged it off. When the game finally came out though, I then came to the realization that, as someone who didn't own the DLC in the first place, it would be worthwhile for me to purchase this (or have this purchased for me in my case :D). With the new differences in the engine and enemy placement as well as essentially getting a game of the year edition which included the DLC for roughly the same price, I'm impressed. They really made it a new experience. Sure, it's the same game, and I can understand why some would be disappointed, especially season pass owners, but when looking at this game from the perspective of someone who didn't own any DLC and was going to spend $30 anyway, I have to say that it was well worth it.   So if you're considering purchasing this game, go for it! The game is as satisfying as ever, and if you're like me and would've ended up getting the DLC anyway eventually, you should definitely pick this up instead. Beware, though, characters don't carry over. One of the few faults I see in this game is the total splitting of multiplayer, which is a fair criticism that I'm afraid would be very hard to avoid in seeing all the changes that were made.",

            "review_text": "I just finished Dark Souls [1], and moved on to the second game and... no. This is not fun. This is frustrating for all the wrong reasons. The level design is ALREADY annoying me, it feels even more clunky than DS1 (which I played without the fix that makes it run better), and although the graphics are gorgeous compared to DS1, I'm just not interested in playing this game. Yes, in DS1 I had a rough beginning, but I pushed on because I at least felt like, for the first few hours, I could make some progress. After a while, I got into my groove and I loved it. I played it twice before I felt like I wanted to move on to Dark Souls II, which I had bought in the same sale. But after only a few hours, and relatively little progress, even less understanding of what's going on and much less interesting level design (and I'm only talking about the first area you play, the most important part of the game for interesting a new player), I just cannot like this game enough to recommend it or even continue to play it.  My main problem is this: I'm BORED. It's not that I'm bored of dying. I don't mind dying. I played through DS1 and DS1 NG+, remember, I can handle the rage at dying. But I'm bored of mechanics that make it deliberately more frustrating from the getgo (e.g. only one estus flask at the beginning, which is totally useless, permanently losing a chunk of my health when I die unless I use a rare item which I only have 1 of so far, ridiculously low stats that improve so slowly with levelling that I'm worried that I might actually not be able to go down any other path than stamina because rolling literally uses half my bar at a time and enemies do more damage than I can block). I'm bored because I have no idea WHY I'm doing anything (the beginning of the game is less than impressive, to be honest, and does nothing to give me a drive to play it). I'm bored because, unlike in DS1 where you can be methodical and make your way through a level multiple times if you're really careful and you learn where the enemies are, this game is just one massive ambush after another, with ranged enemies you can't even stop attacking you, while you're trying to fight melee monsters who can one hit you, and you rely on luck rather than skill to make it through an encounter and get to the next one that you haven't yet been lucky enough to pass (and you can't even heal before you go into because you have literally no way of doing so since your 2 estus flasks are long gone). I'm bored because the level design is, honestly, just awful. Linear and then not linear, a hundred different routes which are all just BLOCKED OFF by locked doors, horrible enemies guarding dead ends with rubbish loot, archers in every concievable spot, one ambush after another that are designed to get you killed rather than you being able to carefully engage each enemy at a time and avoid certain death (after all, you have to go through the same area a large number of times, it isn't fun if you only make it past the first ambush once every 10 attempts because it's basically just luck if you survive), I can go on, and on, as the empty distances you have to run between areas go on, and on...  In short, I just can't be f***ed. Dying is too punishing for a game where you basically just die for a living (in a manner of speaking). The level design is too boring and annoying for me to want to struggle through even the first area. The fights feel too unfair and the mechanics are too clunky for me to be bothered to deal with them. And the drive to play it, the excitement I had in the first game, the interesting concept and inclination to progress (as well as the ability to progress) just isn't there. My biggest complaint, at the end of the day, is that DS2 has just failed to interest me. I would much rather go back and play some more DS1, and will.   I might come back to this game, I might even end up liking it 10 hours down the road when I have decent gear and reasonable stats, but right now, while it's on sale, I want to say this: buy DS1, it's cheaper and it's better, but don't do what I did and buy BOTH while they're on sale expecting to like both. Only buy this game if you liked DS1 and are willing to put up with new and odd design choices and even more awkward mechanics (as if DS1 isn't frustrating enough) from the start. I, personally, cannot, at current, be bothered.   P.S. I've been playing DS2 for 3 hours at the time of review and I am yet to fight a single boss. This bothers me deeply. In fairness, I spent half an hour staring at the gorgeous views in the main town at the beginning before I was willing to actually start the game, but in DS1 you stumble onto a boss's head in about ten minutes and subsequently get flattened. That's a real Souls game.",

Most cause of the crybabies crying over Dark Souls 2 not getting the update for Scholar of the First Sin, but you have to upgrade to experience it all. I can see why you would hate it, but THAT IS NOT what the review system on Steam is for. That does NOT say how the game is, but rather say how of a crybaby you are. Worst part is most of the 'reviewers' say dont buy it, but in order to write a review you HAVE to buy it, and ALOT of the people who are giving it a Thumbs Down and a 'Dont buy cause upgrade from old one' type review got over 6 hours into the game. Like... Dafaq?  On Serious note though:  Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin is not a bad game at all. While not being successor to Dark Souls 1 in terms of lore, characters and Plot (which you will learn either through reading or Watching Vaati on youtube) the game is more solid on the gameplay, its graphics and the connectivity between players than what the first one was.  While probably the 2 biggest sin of the game is Meeh Lore and Story compare to the first game, and that they allow for Fast Travel right from the start, it just feels more superiour right from the start. While some, if not all bosses are a tiny bit meeh compare to how terrific the monsters and bosses in Dark Souls 1 could look, they arent all that bad.  DS2:SOTFS compared to regular DS2 is as follows.  - A tiny bit sharper graphics - More enemies, new enemy placements - 4 Summon team (You and 3 summons) and 2 invaders at the same time! - All of the DLC is in the game. Which makes the cheap price worth it if you dont have the game, or even if you DO have the game, you shouldnt hold it back if you arent playing Bloodborne. - Some tweeks here and there that would probably not be as noticable but some noticable.  Overall. I like this. I have nothing against it. Sure, I dont like that Bandai Namco and Fromsoftware decided it was too hard for them to just give PC the update they deserved, but I am OK with that. It works in my eyes, while yet being a cash grab.  Overall. Yes.. I like this.",

Armor is pretty much useless, you'll have a much smoother time with nothing but a sword and shield. Stamina regenerates at a snails pace and is used excessively when rolling with gear on. Many bosses just rely on the auto targeting being awful for difficulty and equate to a handful of normal mobs in a room you cant leave. The addition of SoTFS solves some issues the game has and it is arguably the best DLC in the series (thanks for wasting your energy on the worst title FromSoft), though it still doesnt correct the inherent flaws in mechanics.

Balance... Fromsoft do not know how to balance their games and a game like Dark Souls 2 is hard to balance because they made a convoluted system in the first place and should have left it for the community to sought out. Mind you if this was the case the community would have gladly made rules as to what can be used and not. Right now as it stands every viable option people state online sucks because fromsoft just nerfed and fromsoft nerf things to the point where it is useless. From Day One every patch you read is how they kept nerfing ♥♥♥♥ over and over but kept the enemies with the same amount of hp and damage as before not even fixing those ♥♥♥♥ing hitboxes. Then they brought the game over to pc and the frame rate made the pc version harder to play because enemies hit earlier at 60fps. They fixed that... No they didn't, some of the boss fights in the dlc hit even earlier or you just can't tell, you gotta guess. Also the fire from the Ancient Dragon comes out faster than expected on consoles. That is not fixed either. Then they rereleased DKSII with this Scholar of the First Sin and made the game even harder with adding more annoying badly designed enemies, that no one wanted to deal with, except the masochists that fromsoft seem to listen to on the forums who are the 1 % of idiots who will tell you how they defeated Fume Knight NG+++ with a broken +5 sword and brag about it on Gamefaqs and BandaiNamco take that as a trusted source of information. More red phantoms that do not fit into the lore of the world and in the two previous titles to Dark Souls II when coming face to face with a red phantom enriched the world. Enjoy fighting constant red phantoms with infinite poise and stamina they pop out of nowhere in the cheapest of places, another gripe of mine in SOFTS, too many cheap spots for the enemies. It takes two to tango fromsoft, so if you want to punish the community for being creative and finding loopholes in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ system you designed than we should have that right.

So as such I can say that you can tell a difference in graphics , mostly lighting/shadows and better textures overall.   The experience is fresh, if I started going fast like this was the normal version I would get my self killed as they are putting many enemies together for you to manage, to compensate that you can more easily have weapons at +6 (early game) which means you deal a good amount of damage making up for the added dificulty of this version.  Summons, as for having 4 people bashing on the last giant it was strange but overpowering. the poor guy was already easy but he went down FAST, plus no one came near to half health.  So my review is about a 7/10 for someone that had the total experience from before, I feel like this was fresh from just going through the game again, the new placement of enemies and items can be just what you needed if you wanted more PVE, my case.  As for PVP I didn't fight anyone yet so I can't tell, but the added number of people could be really fun.  As for how the game feels , feels the same to me. It always played well on my machine and now its as smooth as ever with the better graphics. Undoubtably it's not the graphics we were looking for, but hey, its better. Also I found very cheesy that from one room with no windows to another room with no windows as well, one would become dark as the EA presentation and as soon as you steped out of that room light would come back just like in the previous version, I found that super lame...   So veridict from me is, for more pve, I think its worth it, plus I noticed some different enemy attacks that I never got before ( I played the original more than 500 Hours, not just pvp many hours were pve, so yeah that was a nice suprise ).

Yet, I've heard Dark Souls is not only the only one who has done this, but has done it knowing from Dark Souls 1 that people were having complaints about it, and from what I heard, they did it again with 3.   This puts your save game data at risk. Meaning you may lose 100's of hours of gameplay. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AND CHANCE WASTING YOUR TIME. WAIT UNTIL THE PROGRAMMERS FIX THIS VERY DANGEROUS AND EASILY FIXABLE SAVE DATA GLITCH.  Once they fix this very important and extremely dangerous bug, (Yes, its a bug.) then I will totally recommend this game and give it a 12/10 in quality of game. But no matter how good a game is, when you play it for 100s or even 8 hours and end up losing your save data due to a very simple bug they seem to refuse to fix. THAT NO OTHER DEV HAS BEEN STUPID ENOUGH TO DO. Then this game isn't worth your time. Buy another game where devs actually care about keeping your saves safe. Which is pretty much any other game.  TO PUT IN REITERATION FOR THOSE WHO DONT LIKE TO READ: Bad save location thats easily fixable and not able to be easily backed up and likely end up causing you to lose your data, you can lose 100's of hours due to this. Don't buy until they do a very easy fix.  PS: For those who don't know, %appdata%roaming is meant for three things: Cached files, settings, and temporary files. IT IS NOT MEANT FOR VITAL FILES.",

You definitely have to pick your battles more than before. I honestly can't wait to see what else they've changed and also mess around with the new equipment. I am looking forward to the DLC as well.  Pros so far ------------ -new enemy placement -the entire Darks Souls 2 complete package and all 3 DLC -max online players is now 6 (bring it) -definitely harder this time around   Cons so far ------------- -dont really notice anything different in terms of graphic 'updates' but i havent seen a side by side comparison either -kind of a rip off if you own DS2 AND all the DLC.

            "review_text": "An unbelivably rewarding game for those with the patience to learn its systems.  Dark Souls II is an amazing game and a great sequel. Taking place in the same world as Dark Souls but in another land and another time, you once again find your self a cursed undead in a hostle land full of undead, demons, monsters and giants. and you Defeate the mightest souls of the land to become the next Monarch. But first you must die. and die and die and die again.  Dark Souls II is very similar mechanically and graphically to Dark Souls but the combat has been given a tune up and feels smoother, more fluid. Dark Souls II also changes up a few gameplay details. The biggest being that enemies won't respawn forvever. after you've killed enemies in an area about 10 times, they will stop respawning. This forces you to explore ever further into the game and fight harder and harder foes. It also means that if you die and fail to recover your souls thats less souls left in the game that you could have used to level up or buy things so every soul counts. That being said there are tons of enemies in this game so its very unlikely you'll screw up so bad you won't be able to progress.  While i love most of the changes to Dark Souls II i am a little dissapointed in the lack of boss creatvity in this one. Bosses are the staple in the Souls games (and blood bourne) but in Souls II most of the bosses are some varient of big dude in a suit of armor. Thats not to say fighting them isn't fun, i just wish there was more bosses like the giant fire demon in Demons Souls or The Four Kings in Dark Souls. This seems to be a best of bosses collection with several bosses that feel like re-skins of Dark Souls bosses. They even put the bell gargoyle boss fight in this game unchanged in any way.  But this is a small nitpick and there are still a few stand out boss fights in this one.   When all is said i think i like this game better than the original Dark Souls. I think the changes to the game mechanics make the game more fun and since enemies only respawn a limited number of times it means even if an area is kicking your ♥♥♥ you can gradually empty it one enemy at a time. This is one of the best games i've played in years. Like in the first game, if you have the patience and can except death is a learning experince in this game then you'll have a lot of fun with this game.   Oh and if you've already played the Dark Souls II, this new version makes major changes to the whole game. not just adding new content but also re arranging the enemy layout for the whole game. expect new challenges and surprises as you play through.",

It reminds me that a good game doesn't need to be mindless and that the best reward is still overcoming a real challenge.  PROS: - Great community - Great PVP with a lot of replay value - Top notch story and atmosphere - For the player that pays attention and explores, the lore runs deep in this game. - Responsive controls (Controller ONLY, PC controls are terrible...  CONS: - It's clearly a port from XBOX as they didn't even take the time to change icons... very ugly but not enough to warrant not playing at least once. - Graphics are not as crisp as Bloodborne or WItcher but it came out before the new consoles so it's to be expected and at least the SOTFS version has updated textures. Additionally, although the graphics/textures may not be as good as Bloodborne/Witcher, the atmosphere/fun/game-play/reward that is created will surpass the need to have just slightly better graphics.",

In fact, I believed at the time that Dark Souls 1 was the best Action RPG ever made. So, is the 2nd game a good sequel to the first? My answer is: YES. Dark Souls II excels in every way that the 1st game did while making necessary adjustments to make the game fresh and balanced. Here's something of a list that I made:  PROS:  - Perfect Game Mechanics - Free-Roaming (by definition, not open-world, but you do choose which areas to go to in the game) - Great RPG elements with a huge variety of different ways to build a character - Great Action Elements. The game makes death punishing and meaningful. Combat never gets boring because of how fighting enemies is always engaging and heart-pounding - Intersting environments, and Pretty Graphics (especially with the last update) - Better keyboard/mouse controls than the 1st game. (playing with a game controller is still the best way to go)  And, that's about all there is to say. There is story in the game, but it is completely over-shadowed by the amazing gameplay.  CONS:  - The game lacks a good tutorial and does not explain the anything very well. I found myself going to the Dark souls wiki many times to figure out everything from the basic mechanics of the game, to the different ways to upgrade a weapon, and to the possible paths that I can take in the game. Without the wiki, I would've been EXTREMELY lost. - The game is not for everybody. Not everyone can stand up to the difficulty well in dark souls. However, for one like myself, the difficulty lifts the game up and makes it even better.  I definately recommend this game to anyone who is even only slightly interested. Even if the difficulty turns you off, you might grow to like it when you play the game. The game is difficult only in the right ways.   If you haven't played the 1st game yet, then you should play it before playing this. And, if you already own this game along with all of the 3 DLC packs, you don't need to buy the game again. Just mod the game to make the graphics better.",

PVP is easier and better, so is coop and the number of players that can play at the same time in someones world. These are all very welcome changes, along with all of the DLC's, you can either buy the game along with the Scholar of the First Sin for a higher price than the normal game, or simply pay for the Scholar of the First Sin version if you already have the original Dark Souls 2 for a lower price. It's definitely worth it, and it's even more fun if you play it along with another friend in coop.  This is the type of game where you die to learn an enemies attack pattern, to learn how to defend against it, so it is what you could call a rage inducing game, so you will rage, and a lot. If you die too much, you will have severe penalties to your health and not being able to call others to help you, and you will die alot and yet the challenge is what makes this game so fun.  I definitely recommend it, it's worth the extra cash.",

My friend and I are currently forcing ourselve to finish the game for the story before DS 3 comes out, it being a real pain considering bad game design.  If you want a good souls game I'd recommend Dark souls 1 prepare to die edition.

Cons:  However there a quite a few issues such as random crashes which keep the game running in the background, so your fighting and your game crashes AND you die in dark souls 2. The enemy placement focuses on the swarm mechanic which doesn't cater or amplify the effectiveness and brilliance of the dark souls combat system, this results in a lot of fights either requiring swarm damage or spamming a shield.

The most common hacks I have seen are invincibility and a backstab hack (they will backstab while in front of you). You can restrict the region your're in to have less lag which could be mistaken for a hack but if you're chopping a guy up while he is sitting there wagging his finger at you and taking no damage its probably a hack. I feel like I had enough of dark souls 2 and im going to reap the preorder bonus of dark souls 3. Finally if you want a ratio of hackers based on my experience in the game they are generally found only when they forcibly invade using an orb and 1/3 of them all use some of some variety and 1/5 -2/7 use every single hack in the book (speed, invincibility, flying, insta-everything break).",

If you have, then you'll know what I am talking about when I say that Dark Souls II is by far the largest installment in the series so far. The vanilla Dark Souls II alone took me upwards of 30 hours to complete; now, with the Scholar of the First Sin edition, there is even more content to explore and enjoy.   Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin is a fantastic game. It plays much smoother and faster than both the port of Dark Souls and the vanilla Dark Souls II, and for those who have already played the original Dark Souls II, the Scholar of the First Sin edition still holds some value since it renders the game with better textures (64 bit) and better FPS. Not to mention, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin has the conveinient feature of including all of the DLC avaliable to Dark Souls II in one place (you don't have to buy Crown of the Old Iron King, Sunken King, and Ivory King seperately). Finally, as if that all wasn't enough, Scholar of the First Sin updates some of the areas of the vanilla Dark Souls II with different and new enemies (*SPOILER ALERT*: It adds a new ending too), creating a fresh challenge for those who've already conquered Dark Souls II.  Here is my Pro/Con breakdown:  Pros: - 64bit textures - Smooth and fast gameplay with a refined feel - Full controller support (playing with controller is a must for a Souls game IMO) - Includes the orginal Dark Souls II with updated areas and a new ending - Includes all the DLC avaliable to Dark Souls II installed with it as a package  Cons: - Souls game (Yeah, you're gonna die, like a lot.) - For those who already have vanilla Dark Souls II and all the DLC purchased, SoTFS doesn't really have too much value  All and all, I loved this game and would definitely recommend it!",

Highly recommend this game to those who like a challenging game based on exploration and combat. The difficulty can be a shock to newcomers but the ambiance, world design and tense, nailbiting combat keeps you coming back for more.  Also, though it's not my cup of tea, this game does have a very active and vibrant pvp aspect. So those into co-op or pvp will be sure to appreciate fighting off invading players or teaming up to take on powerful enemies. Various factions in the game called 'covenants' award players for various tiers of participation in co-op or pvp.   Final Verdict: Very challenging but rewarding experience.",

The enemy locking feature is pretty terrible. Some covenants are just ridiculous (maybe its because not many people play this game anymore). Hardly any story elements except those vague descriptions of items. There are like 1 paragraphs of lore on a major character in the wiki page. The music was meh compare to many Rpgs I've played. The final bossfight was too easy? There are no quests and things to be done like the usual RPGs , just go to an area, pick up all the items, kill all the monsters, beat the bosses and go to the next area, rinse and repeat.

The starter tutorial is also pretty limited and prepare to have to figure some stuff out for yourself, like oh I can slide down ladders, that's pretty nifty! Oh there is a leap attack, oh wow! nice! But for some figuring stuff out is fun, so perhaps that was the intention, who knows.  Gameplay is awesome - I'm not enjoying the game right now because I'm dying like every 2 minutes, but I know once I get the hang of it, this will be a really awesome game. Combat gets pretty intense, it is one of those games that will have you arched up, tilting with your character as he/she goes left and right, your toes will spasm and you will breathe in very deeply as you about to kill this huge behemoth and he gives you a little backhand which takes up 50% of your HP. Then it really gets intense!  Graphics are cool, great mood throughout the game, soundtrack is pretty tight too.  All in all apart from stupid UI, this game comes together pretty well and is worth playing, that is, If you like dying and are up for a challenge.

            "review_text": "I've been revisiting this game and honestly I've found it to be much better than Dark souls 3 especially when it comes to mechanics.   I remember back when 2 was relatively new the game (especially pvp) was a broken mess but I'm pleasantly surprised to see it now, The devs did an amazing job at patching this game up and fixing all of the issues I had with gameplay and mechanics.   The base game is fairly weak as far as souls games go and many of the bosses are more or less filler which is great if you plan on playing through coop with a friend or two however the DLCs (that come prepackaged with scholar) are absolutely incredible and it's most redeeming feature.   one thing I am sad about coming back to this game is that Soul Memory still exists.  Soul Memory is a record of every single point of experience/currency (souls) that your character obtains and matchmaking is based purely on a tiered range based on this record. It does not take into account your character level or the fact that you may have lost souls on your way, it encourages players to max out their characters (which to me isn't really interesting) as opposed to playing around a meta level where one has to make choices and compromises based on what kind of character you want to make.  It truly is the worst idea they've ever come up with and I hope they scrap it for SL matchmaking some day.  This mechanic already divides too many players and I feel like it would be much more alive if they replaced it.  Twinking is always going to be a thing and Soul Memory doesn't even prevent twinking anyways, as I'm fairly sure some people out there probably just CE in 99 red eye orbs and up weapons to +10 asap combined with the agape ring.   The best possible scenario would be to scrap SM matchmaking and use the matchmaking system from 3 (Soul Level + Highest Weapon level)  But apart from that it's still a great game and worth picking up.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin is the definitive version of this game. If you’re looking to buy the game, this is the version to get. This version has all of the DLC, better lighting, and many general changes that are too numerous to list here. From Software gets a huge demerit from me for the butchered release schedule of this game, which kind of screwed over people who had bought in to the new game, and the fact that the different versions of the game split the multiplayer up into different populations is another negative thing. I felt it important to mention that this happened in order for folks to be aware in the future, however I don’t hold the bad management of this game against it.  I’m not going to go in to the basics of the Souls series, because I figure you kind of have to know them by this point. If you’re curious, I vouch for starting from the first game (Dark Souls 1) and working your way up. There is a ton of content in Dark Souls 1 to keep you busy for a long time, and if you love this style of game you’ll be thirsty for more.  Dark Souls 2 is very different from the first game, and it is difficult to say whether these changes are for better or for worse. There were a few personnel changes under this game, and it really does show. The general game runs very well compared to Dark Souls 1, and if you have a decent PC you’ll be pulling 60 FPS compared to Dark Souls 1 being locked at 30.   At points, it feels like the game opts to be hard, rather than challenging, and although the Souls series is known for difficulty, I think it has always been challenging and fair. Dark Souls 2 has a number of moments that are blatantly unfair and frustrating. It really feels like the developers intended you to be summoning phantoms in a lot of areas. One area that comes to mind involves you wading through waist-deep water which slows you down, fighting monsters that are hidden under water, and dodging ranged spell attacks all at once. It’s frustrating to be the only target and I found myself hoping to find phantoms to summon to help me through each area. The game would suddenly get much more fun when I had a second person around to be a target and help deal with the huge packs of monsters the game throws at you.  I must criticize how this game supplements combat difficulty by adding more enemies to encounters, rather than making interesting enemies. The enemies will also pivot 360 degrees and track your movements, which both looks goofy and makes dodging a lot more frustrating.  There are way more levels in this game than the first, but the levels don’t really fit together in a cohesive manner. The world, in fact, is very disconnected and there isn’t much thought put in to the design compared to DS1. Things feel disjointed and strange, but there is a huge variety in level design that wasn’t present in the previous game.   The world is very detailed, and you’ll learn a lot just by slowing down and looking around.   There have been a number of YouTube personalities who have done their own analyses of this game, and if you’re interested in a more granular approach to the problems this game has, I’d advise you to seek them out. However, these are rife with spoilers.  I think this is a good game, but it has left me feeling frustrated at times. I wish there were more people playing, but it is kind of an old game at this point so the lack of population is not surprising. I found myself summoning a lot of phantoms, or hoping to be summoned to grind up some levels. I didn’t talk about PVP much here, but I can confirm that it is pretty active if you seek it out.    ",

Many of the bosses are also 'dudes in armour' which can take away from the aesthetic of what Dark Souls 1 built.  Aside from those grievances, it's an enjoyable game. Prepare to Die.",

Here's a short summary:  The Souls Franchise is by far one of the best game franchises out there, but I felt, after my first run through Vanilla Dark Souls 2, that the sequel to the infamously brutal Dark Souls 1 was lacking in the difficulty that the original had set in stone. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin addresses that.... but in a way that let me down a little.  Let me explain something: If people say your game is too easy compared to the original, you should probably go back and study what made the original so harrowingly difficult, yet enjoyable. The difficulty curve in Scholar of the First Sin is so artificial it hurts. Simply adding more enemies to make the playerbase happy is not an adequate way to satisfy their needs and wants for a more naturally difficult experience.  That being said, Dark Souls 2 was a good game in the way that it adds obscure flavor to the mix, for better or for worse, regardless of how easy it was.   The verdict here is that Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin is good, but some players, including myself, will notice how the dev team lazily threw together a harder obstacle course to make us happy.  7/10",

Stats displayed on character sheet are inconsistent and confusing (B scaling STR is around as strong as S scaling DEX, and once a weapon is infused, the scaling drops a lot more than the scaling letters suggest.)

The second one does reuse some boss from the first, and the worst of all is the platforming. I lost worth of souls by making the wrong step. The game also punish you for Experience(souls) farming by removing enemy, if you kill them a certain of times. also resources are limited.

Hated all the random NPC invasions and ambushes around every corner but after I found the Large Club it got super easy. Like ridiculously easy. Forlorn fights became a game of whack-a-mole as I sit there and R2'd him into the pavement, wait for him to get up then proceeded to R2 him again in the same spot. Most other enemies died really easy to it too because they're pretty much all in armor and weak to blunt. Despite enemies going down pretty easy they also hit hard which can suck if you're being ambushed/stunlocked by dual weilding ones (aka the beginning of the game).   I played this and DS1 blind just to get a true experience and after DS1 this one felt like a game made by someone who was trying to capture what media claimed the game was about (a super hard game where you die a lot) rather than implement some of the smart design choices made throughout the original. The 'a super hard game where you die a lot' thing about the original was just a result of the original design and not 100% the intention.  With all that said these are my pros and cons:  Pros: - Large Club - Large Club - Lots of weapon/armor choices - The one shop keep who becomes cocky as you buy more stuff from him - Fast travel and few more design changes made things move a bit more fluidly - Large Club  Cons: - Enemy and level design was a bit meh - Maybe it's SotFS specific but the difficulty of some levels preceeding boss fights was way off wack. On more than one occassion I've been faced with really hard to get through levels and stupidly easy/uninteresting bosses to finish out the area. Made the overall experience just feel overall forgettable. - Estus, AGL and a few more design changes seem to just be there for added 'difficulty' rather than via smart design choice. There are ways to add difficulty other than handicapping the player and forcing them to grind out levels to get back to default DS1 style gameplay.  - Forlorn coming out of nowhere despite being easy/clubable (and apparently I may just specifically have bad luck because every single one popped out to face me. Every. Freaking. Time.)  If I could give this a middle of the road review I would. It's pretty meh but not terrible. Just get yourself a Large Club and make sure you AGL is 99+ and you should be fine. Also I hear the DLC is good so idk maybe that'll make it more worth it when I play it.  ",

I enjoyed the pvp and found the challenging difficulty a nice nod to '90s gaming.  Level design is incoherent and some mechanics (esp. backstabbing, imho) are in my opinion not well implemented. This game's positive and negative sides have been already widely discussed.   MY personal satisfaction with DS2:SotFS was becoming from total scrub to 'quite respectable danger in' PVP; I'm still being wrecked by experienced players, but at level 85 and SM 500k, I'm currently feeling that I'm bringing havoc and destruction everywhere with my last Claymore+Dark build (PVP &amp; PVE). I've learned boss mechanics where I used to literally turn my character hollow by burning out Soul Memory to now where I can beat some of them without one single death.  So the conclusion I wish to express is:  TL;DR -&gt; The type of reward this game offers might appeal not only to this game''s insider community, but to veteran '90s gamers, too. You will find your new 'Castlevania'.",

From Soft. was so 'scared' of making another 'atrocity' like DSII that they basically made a Dark Souls 1 reskin of Bloodborne. That is what mob psychology does to games.  Dark Souls 2 improves on a load of things, like variety of weapons, armor and character builds, actually competitive caster classes, built-in challenges for end-game, playable PvP etc. The only objective complaints that can be made, we have heard a thousand times. It's about the level design not quite bringing the magic back from the original. Also, some people may find that a few areas offer only 'cheap' difficulty, especially in the (now included) DLC.  The changes made in the Scholar of the First Sin edition are minor. There was a one-year gap between my playthrough of the stock version and I can say the differences are rarely noticeable. It's mainly about blocking off some of the areas in the game to avoid confusion for new players and make the game more challenging for the old players. Some enemy and item placements have been changed, usually for the best. Finally, the graphics were supposedly improved.  Personally, I have put way more hours in this game than in the rest of the series and for good reason, though I won't deny that the true magic of Souls shines in the original Dark Souls. But after you're done with that, drop anchor in this one. You needn't go any further.  If all 'bad games' were like this, I feel the games industry would be MILES ahead right now.",

But forcing you to hunt rat tails to earn ring you want? Or invasions on daily basis with full hollowing? Please. Invasions had meaning in first game. Here it was all rather pointless. And boring. The Boring feeling stalking everywhere in this game is another topic. There were few nice moments but mostly I was just asking Why am I playing this.

The feeling you get when you manage to scrape through a though area is euphoric to say the least. I will list some pros and cons, but do keep in mind my review may be abit biased since i'm ♥♥♥♥ing in love with this game.  Pros: -Emphasis on physical combat seen almost uniquely in Souls/Fromsoftware games -Rich and beautiful world, and a varying level design. No two areas are the same -fun and adicting gameplay -Massive amounts of weapons and armor Cons: -(from my personal experience) dying multiplayer... I hardly found any world to invade or players to summon -Frustrating, and dare i saw abit unfair at times. Hitboxes can be very unforgiving even if you are not in the viscinity of the attack. Mix that with a group of 4 ogres and you'll be sure to lose your ♥♥♥♥  Overall, i'd reccomend Dark souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, and i have yet to play Dark Souls 3, but it seems DS2 really was the exemplary predescesor.",

But what I can say for sure is that every one of you out there at one point before playing this game said to yourself, “Well the Dark Souls II was awful, but maybe THIS one will better.” You attempted to rationalize it by telling yourself that at least this time there wasn’t gonna be annoying bugs, The DLC was in it more, and so were new NPCs, and you think you might have even saw a updated graphics that were lied about initially at the original launch of Dark Souls II. So hopes were high that Dark Souls could be saved, and maybe we all just look back on Dark Souls II as being that really bad one. But what you didn’t realize is how ♥♥♥♥ing wrong you were! And you couldn’t have possibly imagined that even with all the cool Dark Sously stuff that Scholar of the First Sin could actually be WORSE than Dark Souls II. That it could be the worst thing since bagpipes. It was at that moment when you uninstalled the game that you learned to never trust your own judgment again.

It is a beautiful game that challenges you to truly work and strive for every victory, and then have an immense sense of relief and satisfaction when your work pays off (which it will if you stick with it).  The combat in this game is fantastic, and is the centerpiece of the game. You have a wide variety of classes and weapons types at your disposal, and each weapon type truly allows for an incredibly different playstyle from the others. The melee combat is where this game shines and is truly what the franchise is based upon, but there are also “safer” methods of play with ranged magic or bow builds (which you get wrecked with if you ever play PvP).   The online combat is also terrifying and fantastic, as you could be on your last legs trying to get to the next bonfire with 20k souls when you get the notification that “dEEzeNuTZ69 has invaded your world.” You best run like the dickens son. Overall, the game has fantastic combat with a gorgeously designed world and story. Things aren’t shoved down your throat (expect arrows and swords and fire and metal), and you have the option to discover the rich lore and story or just say “bunk that” and just go off and adventure. This was a great entry point in the Souls franchise for me, and I will be a lifelong fan of this series.   10/10 would lose over a million souls again ",

The only thing I would like to mention here is the introduction part to these games.  Dark Souls  had very original and perfect introduction for any game I played.Firelink Shrine and the soundtrack just reflected every emotion one could have. It showed how your journey would conclude as how sad and hopeful you are at the beginning. It portrayed that the state of being dead is usual and one day it will haunt every each of us. It illustrated that there is no true winner or loser. This soundtrack still reminds me of my play through and how I felt when I passed each level and returned to Hireling Shrine as it was my beginning as well as my end.  For   Majula  this concept has changed and while both place and soundtrack captures the the very essence of game it lacks the ambiance and atmosphere that   Dark Souls  has at the beginning.For Majula there is hope and sun,there is still light at the end but for   Firelink Shrine  we are alone,on our own and there is no illumination.There is a great contrast between these games and how they convey their message.While   Dark Souls   is the true definition of dark and desperation   Dark Souls 2  is the manifestation of hope within.

I haven't played the vanilla version of the game, but I've heard from other players that the vanilla version was way easier, and they decided to add more enemies, make them 'smarter', and they added enemies from other locations on areas to make it more challenging. There are way more bosses in this game than there were in the first Dark Souls, but almost every one of these bosses lack the spirit that Dark Souls 1's bosses had. Their design is alright, most of them feel lazy, they feel like From Soft didn't have any new ideas. There were couple of them that were actually really good, but overall they could've been much better. Areas in this game are not really connected as they were in the first game (except for Majula, Iron Keep and its neighbour areas). The thing I really disliked about game's locations is the lack of creativity, once again.  Once again, this game also has lots and lots of items, and the content is pretty good.   Crown DLCs are quite enjoyable. Areas are well designed, they've certainly upped the difficulty in all three DLCs. Most of the bosses are exceptionally good, better than any in the main game.     Overall, I would give this game 8/10. It is definitely a great game, but it didn't live up to my expectations. If you are looking to buy it, I would still suggest that you get the first Dark Souls and make it work with mods, it isn't so hard. If you already did that, this game is a good game to play while waiting for Dark Souls 3, or if you want more Dark Souls as I did. I am really looking forward to Dark Souls 3, as it is going to combine the best things from the franchise. Miyazaki didn't work on Dark Souls 2, which is probably why it feels this way, but he is back for Dark Souls 3. Hopefully, Dark Souls 3 will be on the same boat as Demon Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne are in terms of quality of the game.       Pros:   - More Dark Souls - Very good graphics - PC port is much better now (no need for any mods to play it) - Atmosphere of the game is pretty cool. - More attributes to level up - Better PVP - Torch system - Warping between the bonfires is immediately accessible)    Mixed:   - Good, but not so great of a story - Soundtrack is not so memorable - Enemies do not respawn after killing them couple of times, so the areas are no longer as farmable    Cons:   - Lazy bosses (couple of exceptions like Looking Glass Knight, Executioner's Chariot, The Lost Sinner, and most of DLC bosses) - Non-connected areas (only connected areas are Majula and the Iron Keep IIRC) - Cheap feel for a lot of areas - NPC's are not really interesting -   MILD MANNERED PATE WILL NEVER BE TRUSTY PATCHES  ",

If you come from Dark Souls II (dx9) You'll see some changes, like graphics, bosses more difficult, and even new enemies. If yo've come from 'Dark Souls Prepare to die edition', You don't have to play Dark Souls II (dx9) to start Dark Souls II SOTFS, it's the same history, same characters, just better graphics and a little more things like I said.",

It uses the same mechanics for the most part, same gear and a lot of the fights feel like retextured fights from the original.  The bosses themselves aren't as weird and amazing as in the original either, some of them are cool and a lot of them are just giant regular mobs.  There's also no fights with special mechanics, I mean in the original there were fights where you had to figure out what on earth you were supposed to be actually doing to hurt the boss and in this there's none of that, the most you're ever doing is just figuring out where to stand to not take huge amounts of damage.  They also added npc summons, that quite literally trivialise so many boss fights it's unbelievable.  The game in short, isn't anywhere near as hard as the original and when you love the original for punishing you until you finally win.. this one just isn't the same.. you'll feel like loads of the fights were just ridiculously easy.  It's still a good game and worth playing, but other than the same kind of setting and the fact that you will actually die a load of times still, it's absolutely not as hard as the original and that's what made the original so special.",

Overall, the game is a little more difficult to learn if you aren't using a controller. It isn't because controllers are convenient, but because quite literally all of the tutorials are showing you how to play- using the controller format. Come to think of it, it isn't limited to the tutorials, it's true for everything. If you want to learn everything for yourself, you can just skip this next part.   I learned the hard way that Space is 'B', Enter is 'A', and E is 'X'. I still haven't figured out 'Y'.   Luckily, the first area is kind of like a 'safe haven' where you can try to learn these controls on your own.  The game itself rewards the cautious and alert. I've saved myself dozens of times because I looked both ways before crossing a room, or realized that item next to a corner is probably a trap. Of course, to learn 'that item is probably a trap', I had to die or nearly die to a similar situation. This is where the next paragraph comes in.  The game also gives you many chances to learn the area around you, learn the AI of an enemy, or notice patterns. If you die or rest at a bonfire, all enemies respawn in the exact same area, in the exact same state. Things technically don't get easier, but because of this it feels like it does once you go through the same area enough times.  Anyway, aside from the game expecting you to use a controller, I really don't mind. I know it looks like I haven't played this very long, but that's because I typically play offline at this point in time. Not sure if that'll change in the near future, but it won't matter because this review will be lost in the sea of other reviews.",
