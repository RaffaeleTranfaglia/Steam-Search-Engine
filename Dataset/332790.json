    "description": "The number of missing in the city increased. People talk about the experiments on human beings. And now, only you can figure out if it was true. Especially because you have no choice. Mysteriously, you find yourself in a terrible location 40 meters underground. Your name is Katrine, and you do not remember anything about your past.",

            "review_text": "A girl wake up in a dungeon.. Well A lot games start with that. This small 3rd person shooter is a very small horror based game that will only take less then 1 hour to complete.   The map layout and the background BGM is decent and everything else is not. The control is simple but different then just about every 3rd person shooter game I ever played. The Graphics and view angle is really weird at time. And since it's only 1 hour long there are really not that much content. About 3 different enemy in the entire game with no boss make this game really scream out for more. More content.  As for now the game itself is simple and okish. Maybe developer can learn from this experience and make better games in the future.  There are some dlc for this game but it's only guns for level one to make it easier and some different cloth for girl to wear. Really not worth the money.  Achievements are really easy to get. Just don't miss the gun on level 2,3 and 4. I couldn't die enough times and shoot enough times by the time I finished the game so I had to grind a bit for those two achievement.  3.5/10 as for right now. A bug free game for me and it does have achievement for quick 100% and trading cards. Really not that enjoy on it's own.",

CONS: It's a really crappy game. I tried to give it 15 min, but the I hated the map layout. I had plenty of bullets, but no friggin' gun.   SUMMARY: If it's 80-90% off, buy it for the trading cards.

            "review_text": "No real positives to this game. There's really no story. You wander around this dimly lit level with corridors, doors, and rooms that are copy pasted from 1 another, without a map, or any real direction. Easy to get lost because every room, door, and hallway looks the exact same, and theres no map or marker to use for guidance. To equip or use items every time you have to press escape, then go to inventory, then click use, you know, because the most simple things should take an unnecessary amount of time. You constantly get stuck on invisible items or nothing at all, any many times I couldn't back up because......bad game. Also genius of them to use an angled overhead view, so that you really can't see anything and it makes movement and everything else super awkward and annoying. After fulfilling all mission objectives and wandering around for 10 min and no clue where to go, I just gave up. Only enjoyable part was laughing at the broken, nonsensical english. 3.5/10",

            "review_text": "The decision of 'recommending' this game was rather hard.In general it's a very short(in minutes:57) game with some things that could have gotten improved.For the price of less than 2€ it was okay to buy it, but it wouldn't be a loss if I hadn't. For me there was only one major problem in the first three levels: Lots of walking in confusing corridors.The flashlight was not necessary, but a nice addition.Some of the equipment in the rooms is being reused and therefore all the critical places are getting reused, too.I found myself being stuck in a chair in front of a shelf with items more than once looking exactly the same.Whenever you find the exit to a level, but failed to find a document(which should be optional, there could be achievements for collecting them all), you get sent back to find everything before you leave.Probably the most sensible thing to do when surrounded by zombies(oh well, at this time they might be all dead already and you might be alone for the ten minutes you're walking around aimlessly).There are health packs and adrenalin(which fills up your stamina), but there is no hotkey for them.At least the game doesn't tell us about it.The inventory is opened with 'i' which can be stressful in situations and doesn't help with the stamina problem, because it takes as much time to use adrenalin as it takes to just wait for it to load up. The AI of the zombies is okay, but the one from human enemies in later stages seems to be identical.The two remaining stages are more linear and are actually fun, because it let's you simply shoot and collect. The story of the game is rather 'meh', but fairly well executed.Nothing to complain here. To make things longer than necessary there are achievements.Those are okay except for 'Die 10 times.' and 'Die 25 times.'.I died once in the entire game(because I needed to press 'i' in a tight situation).Dieing more than that is simply a waste of time, not a waste of skill...and even if so, what's the achievement about it? There are lots of things the developer could have done better, for example encouraging the player not to shoot or letting the player choose between difficulties.Blindly shooting at everyone just takes away the horror factor that was there in the first level(since there were no weapons). Graphically the game is okay, but not up to the modern standard. If you're looking for something new, this game is cheap and doesn't take a lot of time.No replay value, not a lot of horror, but in level 2-5 lots of shooting and running around.For the price I'd call this game 'worth'.",

            "review_text": "Oh dang, shameless russian cashgrab. There is so much i dont like about this 'game'. The 3rd person top down idea is a nice style which has been tried and tested, but this game fell short. The map felt zoomed in at all times, you could not control the fixed angle or extend the distance. The lighting was horrid, i understand the game is called 'Darkness Assault' so pun, but bad design is a thing regardless. The options menu is horribly lacking when it comes to flexability. The game is playable with certain DLC packs, but vanilla it is a terrible 'survivor horror' cliche, with the Guns DLC it is a bad '3rd person action' cliche.   The game itself has a whopping 5 acts, with no big final battle, the story is confusing and feeds you nothing unless you open menus and read scraps of paper. Starts out a zombie clone game, became a cop killing game about locating professors. IMO, the only thing this game has going for it, is the rather small achievement pool and badge progression. It isnt the worst looking game out there, but the controlls are so terrible. So terrible. Straifing is a chore and combat is....well you can shoot. No melee, stamina and batteries.   It can be 100% completed within 3 hours.",

Then you find guns, shoot zombies, go to the upper floors, shoot cops who are only armed with batons, get to the mastermind, mastermind shoots himself... and then it says 'to be continued', even though that finding the mastermind alive was the whole point of the game... I'm still recommending this because it was challenging at some points + easy achievements.  But devs should've added an option in the beginning to 'stay in the kitchen' instead of '..Mysteriously, finding yourself in an underground facility..' would've been a better game.   really bad English in pretty much all of the documents that you find in-game   -9/0 Katrine should've stayed in the kitchen.",
