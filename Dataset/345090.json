            "review_text": "In a sea of TD sameness, here's a clever little standout. The artist has a good eye for our glorious 16-bit past, while gameplay, if hardly revolutionary, is dependably fun. Things get a little hard quickly as you must carefully plot your skills tree chioces to advance (thankfully, upgrades are reversable...as you *will* return to re-jigger them). I prefer this, in fact, to the usual one-size-fits-all upgrade paths in TDs. A grace note: I am surprised, actually, by the music, which is more intelligent and moody than these soundtracks deserve to be.   A game freeze after a long session -- also experienced, BTW, in the online Flash version -- points to a small problem lurking in the code. Other than this, it's fluid on my not-so-beefy Mac Mini and I'd happily see more from this developer.",

Luring gameplay. Game is small, but isn't small comparing to other TDs.  Game is a gem. Good memories will remain about it.  I hope authors will make more good games - want to see them.  Ayuoy, ayouy, ayouy, ayouy, ayouy. Ay. Uoy! 9/10",

            "review_text": "This game is almost really good, but is ultimately frustrating. The art, maps, units, upgrade path are all fun at first. There's an interesting mechanic of gems and money to upgrade towers during a mission, but also upgrade towers, weapons and your base after a mission. It has what most tower defense games don't, which is a bit of a story.  However, after about a dozen missions you get stuck on levels that can only be overcome by grinding back on earlier levels to get coins to upgrade your stuff. Not a little bit of grinding, like 10 hours of grinding for each new level. For example, grinding a level perfectly can give you 20 coins or so (it's random, so a range from 15-30) and that can take 10-20 minutes. It can take 300 coins to upgrade a particular path. There's about 40 different paths for each weapon type, tower type, etc. You may have to replay a mission 15 times to upgrade something all the way. That's almost 4 hours for just one path. Multiply that times 40 and it's over 150 hours of grinding. This is not fun.  I'm not sure why the designers did it this way. It seems like they originally had a super evil plan to sell upgrades and then their conscious got to them and they stopped the microtransactions. Thanks for this as it would be terrible to have to buy this stuff. But as a result they didn't adjust game play.  I would not recommend buying this unless it was 25 cents or something.",
