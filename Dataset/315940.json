    "description": "Best Indie PC Game, Digital Dragons 2014. Top Hat is a 2D action adventure platformer, just like old NES games. If you are tired of “games” in which you get hit by heavy machine gun and grenades, and all you need to do is cover behind the wall to replenish HP, then Top Hat is a perfect game for you!",

I don't have a down key due to shenanigans on my keyboard, and even though i had configured my movement keys to a standard WASD skematic, the S key refuses to register as my down movement key when i travers the ladders. That is my only gripe, the lack of quality for configuraton realiability.",
