            "review_text": "This is a real treat if you enjoyed coin-op games in their glory days - hand me over my walking cane, will you? It looks like a simple twin-stick shooter game with rooms taking seconds to clear, but it actually features a very simple score mechanic that requires you to learn and remember the level layouts. It is as much if not more memory than reflex-based. You got a single life, so you  will  learn! The sights and sounds, in all their paroxystic approach, are very fitting the silly theme of the game, and true(?) to its name, DRM can be run freely outside of Steam.  I have been loving this game since its first iteration, and my highscore is pathetic so I won't share it with you.   For the anecdote and developper stories lovers: I ran into an issue the other day - my new keyboard layout wouldn't allow me to play the game properly. The author, Mr. Fearon, replied to me within the day and pushed an update allowing key configuration. I could enjoy his game again within 48 hours. ",

            "review_text": "Death Ray Manta has lasers in his head  He blew up his house, now he lives in space instead.  Then at the local post office that same day but later He explained he'd soon be moving as his bungalow was now a crater.  They were very helpful and gave him a change of address form As though laser house explosions were really the daily norm.  But the constable called and was grumpy and told him if he left town there'd be trouble As his fat black handlebarred bicycle was now under three tons of rubble.  So in dead of night to deafening synth and psychadelic fury Death Ray Manta highjacked a roman candle and made for Alpha Centauri.  ...  Death Ray Manta SE is the most satisfying shooter I've played in years, *maybe ever*. Perhaps if I was a huge shooter or retro arcade fan that would mean more, but I'd certainly favour it to Geometry Wars or Hotline Miami - both fine games, but DRMSE just feels better for me.  It certainly starts as it intends to continue: even the title screen is hyper saturated neon with a deliberate effort to make figuring out what the hell you should do to start the game far more unclear than the norm.   I hated it first time I played it. But I get it now, this is genius.  Because it isn't the title screen. It's more like the 'You died, here's your score, left click to retry' screen. Like Super Meat Boy players failing and rapidly retrying is the norm, it's encouraged, so stopping the neon and synth would be senseless. And making it less a shock to the eyes and ears would ironically make it far more jarring once the first level starts again.  Nothing out of the game feels out of place, oddly everything feels simultaneously hard to accept and like it dovetails together perfectly.  It throws too much neon and synth at you; once you overcome that adversity and you feel unstoppable; not many games feel this great continually to play. It's perhaps almost an equivalent of getting over the shock of trying tabasco sauce for the first time and later discovering a lifelong love of spicy food.  Death Ray Manta SE is something special, something glorious.",

            "review_text": "A rather hard one to judge, as I seldomly play twin stick shooters, but this one isn't great at that either. The good thing here is that it offers everything it promises: very colorfull laser fights in space and some old sci-fi/disco theme. The bad thing is that that is ALL that is offered: it's a single track, sound effects are repeated the whole time and after a few variations of the enemies...that's pretty much it. No replays, power-ups, lives, ammo, weapons or anything. The only progression is in the levels, and these just add more mindless monsters each time.  Of course for four bucks I don't really expect much more than that. And it certainly has that 'okay, I'm dead...let's play again!!!' feel that old arcade games had. Controls aren't bad (note: controls are a must. It's not even half as fun with keyboard and mouse). But aside from the audio that gets repetitive fast, there is quite a lot of visual cluttering. Navigating between monsters is hard enough as it is but it throws pretty fireworks at you as well.  So...I wouldn't recommend. But wouldn't stop you from getting it either (unless perhaps you don't have a gamepad controller with 2 sticks on it).",

This game is clearly silly in a strange way, but gameplay-wise it holds strong. The controls are tight, and you won't die for anything you don't deserve to. It isn't easy to get in and play at first, but once you've given it a few shots you'll get the hang of it. Also it's a good way to practice this type of game, since you can play so many games in such a short time. The colors are beautiful, and even though it looks like it should be it's not that graphics intensive.  I'd give it a solid 9/10. A few things could easily put it up to a 10 in my books (but I'm an amateur so I may not be the best resource). it's definitely a good way to spend 4 dollars.",
