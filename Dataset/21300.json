This game is hard, you absolutely have to use a keyboard and not mouse or better yet a controller. The level design is superb, the sound effects amazing, retro feel/design and implentation is outstanding. So many classic games wrapped into one, do your self a favor and give it a try. It's $5, and it's a game that's challenging in a fair way, so you'll be back and glad you bought it.",

Gravitron 2 looks really promising and feels like a cross between Defender and Scramble, but the keyboard and mouse controls do not make this game friendly to play.",
