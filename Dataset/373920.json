            "review_text": "Why on Earth did they target the glory of Gregor towards mobile devices. Gregor deserves the full high fidelity and potential depth that a PC / Console release would demand.  Eisenhorn deserved better.   At least the books won't let me down like this does.  Edit: I should justify this negative review.  1. Controls are irritating 2. AI is stupid 3. Gameplay is repetitive (as you'd expect from a mobile --&gt; PC port) 4. The level of detail clipping is VERY apparent (2k + max settings) 5. The AA is very poorly done 6. Models and animations are low quality 7. Textures would be pretty, but the LOD wankness kills it 8. The ambient effects (water, steam, rain) is rubbish 9. Level Design is mediocre 10. The novels provide such depth of story and visual description it is amazing that the title has gone ad-hoc in some cases for the sake of creating an 'interesting level'  For what it is (a mobile game) it is excellent, it is what you'd expect; but publishing it on PC may have been a mistake.",

            "review_text": "Well, I was bored and I loved the source material, so I forced myself to play this despite the large number of negative reviews. Well, I made a terrible mistake.  Firstly, I don't mind the graphics. The atmosphere is reasonably well done. The Hubris backdrop is particularly well done and the Saruthi look (and sound) great.  Mark Strong does a good job with the voice acting of Eisenhorn and the guy who does the voice for Aemos does a great job. The rest of the voice acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. Not a big deal for me though.  After playing for a bit, the big problems surface: - The game is very glitchy, particularly in the cutscenes  - Events occasionally don't trigger or Eisenhorn gets stuck and I have to keep restarting from the last check point. This happens a *lot*  - There are quite a few QTEs (I don't know why people still use them as a game mechanic when they are universally hated)  - The level design starts poor and gets progressively worse through the game. I was really hoping that they would do something special with KCX-1288; unfortunately not, instead it's the most tedious part of the game.   - Dead bodies disappear in about 5 seconds which breaks immersion for me. I mean, come on, this is 2016!  - The AI is very poor, with your companions mostly only teleporting around, as they seem unable to follow you.  Basically, don't buy this game. If you haven't read the books, go and by them instead. If you have read the books, go and read them again. This isn't the WH40k game we wanted.",

            "review_text": "I've read the Eisenhorn books something like 10 times. I love them. And I was waiting for over a year for this game.  It's pretty disappointing. Obviously rushed. The camera angles in particular are bizarre, the cutscenes look dated (think early 2000's graphics) and the voice acting is pretty bad, Eisenhorn excepted. Everything is very linear. I'd expected something more akin to Fable / Fable 2, but it's an uninspired playthrough.  Having read the books so much everything looks a certain way in my mind's eye - the game hasn't captured the same sense of awe and mystery, in my view, and much of the subtle nuance has been lost.  Probably worth a tenner, but pretty bog standard.",

            "review_text": "Extremely mediocre game at the moment, definitely smells mobile port all over it. The combat at least this far in is extremely simplistic and the A.I. is completely idiotic. The graphics are definitely held back by mobile and while they are of higher quality than on mobile, they are still no where near the quality they should have been on PC. And let us not even get started on the awful texture pop in that occurs at times.   The design of the worlds, characters and weapons definitely scream Warhammer 40,000 and this being the first 'domestic 40k' game we have had it‘s a interesting journey and a nice change from the war torn landscapes of the other games placed in the universe. The voice acting can be really hit and miss, Eisenhorn and his crew range from good to excellent, whilst some of the side characters and enemies range from OK to absolutely awful, the first boss being a particularly huge let down. The story, being based on the  excellent  novel  Xenos  by Dan Abnett, is sole reason I will give this a cautious recommendation.   If you go here looking for a game, you will be sorely let down by what you find, but if all you want is an interactive version of the book, then you will probably walk away satisfied in the end.",

Its as vile and corrupted as chaos itself.  Really, the folks at Pixel Hero games, and whoever gave this game the 'Ok' for launch, needs to seriously reconsider their careers if they think that their work was good.  Where do i even start? How about with the animation that makes the Ultramarine movie look good? Or the voice acting, where certain characters sound like they were voiced by amateurs with a bad microphone in a cellar? Or the, i dread to call it as such, gameplay? A severly stripped down Batman Arkham series clone that feels as awkward to play as it is to look at.  But what adds the most insult to injury is that its not just any Wh40k franchise, its Eisenhorn. One, if not the best Book series in the entire franchise.  Cheers GW for handling your license in a way that allows things like this to happen.  *Sigh* Here's to hope that Spacehulk Deathwing and Martyr will be good...  ",

            "review_text": "Okay, I just finished the game on easy (please don't judge me, I swear it was an error !), and here are my thoughts on: Eisenhorn: XENOS.  So, I really love the W40k universe and upon seeing this game, I felt the urge to buy it. Now I'll try to be as objective as I can. This game is neither good or bad, yes it has it's issues that plenty of reviews have pointed out; strange camera, bugs like being stuck in some jump spots, enemies quite simple (Sometimes even frustrating, like, how the frick some enemies dodge ALL MY SHOTS ? AT POINT BLANK ?), for me those were the most 'irritable'.  But, there also many good things, the environment was great, the last levels were cool looking, reminded me of those beautiful necrons ! The many weapons available and the different crew members were appreciated. The plot was decent for someone who hasn't red the books, maybe juuuust maybe was the end a bit too complicated to figure it out for my lil' mind. And the choice to either sneak your way through or jump into battle is a good mechanic.  TL;DR The game is average, there are cons and pros, to someone who has some spare money, why not and if you don't know W40k this is a 'good' start (Unlike fire warrior on PS2 amiright ?!)  If I could not choose between yes and no I would, but since I don't want to punish the devs, I'd rather help them.",

            "review_text": "In all honesty, I cannot give this game a positive review nor a negative review. The game is far from being perfect, many aspects were poorly executed. Especially the voice acting, it is so terrible that it's on the verge of heresy.  However the details and designs of maps, characters, and puzzles are very interesting. Combat system is terrible in the beginning but when you get used to it, it can be rather fun. Whats even better, is that its based on Dan Abnett's 'Xenos'.   So, if you have the heart of ignoring many flaws and still enjoy the game, then I'll recommend it for you. If not, well, I can't blame you.",

Mobile roots are obvious and it has the sort of combat depth one would expect from an ambitious mobile game. Biggest draw for me is how much time it spends having Mark Strong read the book aloud. Get it if an interactive audiobook is interesting to you.",

            "review_text": "To make one point clear: I've read the book (in fact all of them) multiple times. After the Interrogation Lowing is mentioned dead, but inevitably joins the party on 56-Izar when entering the Saruthi building. Nice to have ghosts as company. Later it replaced him with Bequin, who for reasons has the same ability modifier (which IMPROVES you psychic strength instead of, you know, inhibiting it). The game does not follow the book to the word, but it is the same story. Many spoken parts are actually directly read from the book, but sometimes this leads to strange situations when something is mentioned, but has never happened in the game (the comm-messages from Maxilla on KCX-1288 for example, or the fact that malahite smokes pipe). This is not extremely bad, but slightly awkward. Also interrogating Malahite does not take place in a mental image of some excavation but within a chapel, so some statements like 'I have to work' are not quite understandable. The one thing I missed the most was the point of the Saruthi worlds being 'wrong'. They were unnerving, but more due to the need to run through several nearly identical large rooms; to the point this part was just boring after the first minutes. Every tile there was absolutely the same and every angle was correct. While I have to admit that making them all different and the angles look wrong would have been extremely difficult, it takes out the most important theme of the Saruthi. Eisenhorn calls a Space Marine 'brother'; if I am not completely mistaken, Jeruss also calls Eisenhorn 'brother'. Are they all a happy family or did someone mess with the titulations? Also every single Deathwatch Marine seems to originate from the Dark Angels Chapter. The Deathwatch is called 'chapter', but since the book was from an earlier fluff period, that is some lazy research by the developers. Bolters ans Bolt Pistols sound like some fancy toy guns instead of high-calibre weapons that fire self-propelling mass-reactive explosive shells. The voice acting is not very good (except the voice of Eisenhorn himself), but it is tolerable. Schongard's mask looks like some kind of respirator and he sounds as if he had braces and serious swallowing issues. Molitor looks like Heldane's twin brother. Endor is a poweful psyker here, for he speaks without opening his mouth during the holo-communication. And that were the negative points. And many are rather to be considered odd than bad. Although I prefer the book, the game is still enjoyable, if you can see past several small and a few big mistakes made during the development progress.",

            "review_text": "This is a good game. Not some muliplayer nonsense but a game focused on story, campaign and character. What is good in addition is the low graphics. 1. it feels like the old 'Fire Warrior' game for the playstation. 2. low for my laptop as my own graphics card cant handle all these big games too busy focused on too much details. Eisenhorn focuses more on teh story, with small graphics that dont clog up what this game is really about.  The story is great, i never bothered at first with the Inquisition as i keep seeing them as bullies to the imperium but the character shows me that not all of them are madmen hell bent on blowing up a planet. Its about a man/detective/spy of the imperium focusing on taking down the enemies of the imperium on worlds that have not/or yet affected by the war or invasions.   The story is well paced out and i do like a bit of the combat. Little tricky at first because of the controls being from combat to non combat but slowly getting the hang of it. Thank you for allowing us to use a chainsword and many more weapons.  However, I must say a few negative points 1. Some of the animation or sound effects with the weapons could be a little bit better, for example the lasguns, bolters and shotguns. Not always imediate to see if i am being shot at and i like to see exploding bodies when shooting. 2. The companions or the individuals that accompany you could fight a little bit better. 3. A few small touches to the animation like facial expressions for examlpe.  Amazng work to the team that made this game. Hope to see another Eisenhorn or a similar game based on another book(s) of the warhammer 40k with the same graphics for us peeps ^^",
