    "description": "Make circles! While the world spins round and round all you have to do is just press the space bar when the spinning bar is at the right place to make a circle. At first it’s easy, the bar oscillates with a period of pi seconds (3.14 s^-1), giving you plenty of time to make your first circle. But it won’t be easy for long!",
