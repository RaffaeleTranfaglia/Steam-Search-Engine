            "review_text": "Don't let the low price, the simple visuals and the fact that it's a tablet port fool you.  I would have never imagined myself playing a shooter ported from tablets on PC and having so much fun. First of all, it's miles ahead of the portable version, almost a different game. The fact that there are no microtransactions help you enjoy this as a wholesome product, albeit with a little bit of fair grinding.  A good zombie game needs 2 things: good zombies and good weapons. While this is far from many AAA titles, the weapons in Dead Effect look and sound meaty enough to feel the punch of every shot, but don't expect spectecular quality of animations and sounds. The zombies however are a whole other dimension, and are at the core of what makes Dead Effect so fun, as they should be. Despite the small scope of the game, it features quite a few types of enemies, each of which in its turn has its preset of behaviors, some of which are randomnly generated depending on difficulty. In other words: zombies are dangerous and unpredictable, and demand the best of your attention, reaction and situational awareness. The dodge funcion is in this game for a damn good reason. This, combined with the very much Doom3-inspired leveldesign, make up for a great immersive atmosphere of an ever-so-popular contaminated spaceship setting. There's even a small cheesy story that works well enough to glue the events together and give the player a sense of purpose in addition to a sense of place.  If I had to complain about Dead Effect, which would be stupid considering the price, I'd say some will find the grinding tiresome (althought there's not THAT much of it compared to other games of this type), and not much variety beyond the campaign and the survival modes. While admittedly true, these problems didn't stop me from finishing the game twice, and I'm sure I'll be going in for a third time on Hell difficulty where almost every zombie hit is deadly.  In conclusion, Dead Effect is easliy one of my best surprise purchases on Steam. It's like Doom 3 and Killing Floor had a baby that doesn't know much yet but already shows great potential for being its own thing. Big thing, hopefully.",

I can't say anything against the graphics, they are nothing special, but not bad either, but that's pretty much the only good thing I can say about this game.  The game mechanics are sub-par. You can't even jump, aiming is a game of luck; at least with some weapons and some enemies simply refuse to die even after 5 or more headshots. Oh, and you WILL get swarmed by zombies all the time, since your tools are simply not effective enough to kill them fast enough.   And this is actually the worst part of the game. You can't just progress from level to level like in most FPS. No, the game wants you to play every level again and again and again, because every single piece of equipment and every upgrade costs in-game money and you WILL have to upgrade them. Healing? Pay with points. Better shotgun? Pay with points. Ammo? Pay with points. And of course a single grenade alone costs so much points that you will have to replay a previous level in case you don't use it in a super effective way. Which, of course, will not work, because sometimes explosions will just drip off from enemies.  As I get it the devs promised to put more work into the game, but that never happened.",

            "review_text": "This is by no means a masterpiece, but I am finding it to be surprisingly fun.   Most of the level design and combat are unimaginative, but can be fun despite that. If the game frustrates you, try sticking with it just a little longer (the start of level I think 5 is pretty obnoxious and cheap, but not impossible). Everything upgrades, and you can continue for cash. That mechanic is silly, annoying, and another (add it to the list) of painful reminders that this was a phone game. But at least you can continue.   Looks pretty good, like Doom 3 with holiday lighting (Game in general is very derivative of Doom 3, with some Killing Floor in there too). The art assets are solid. The animations and weapons are satisfying. If only they would have spent more care and effort on story, level design, and making the transactions less obvious, this could be decidedly better. That said, it does function as both a fun shooter and as some wonderfully campy kitsch. The actor who voices the German scientist delivers his lines like a bad Ahnald impersonation meets 'Und now is dee time un Sprockets ven vee dahnce'. It cuts into the dread that the game does manage to create, and I can't help but laugh. It's like The Tower of Deadly Monsters or Far Cry Blood Dragon, but, you know, with less intent.  The extra modes are good for earning cash for weapons and upgrades and extending the play. If this had been a mod for doom 3 it would probably be considered a classic. A pretty fun shooter that mostly works and looks pretty good, you could do worse. Worth it on sale or in a bundle.   edit: Finished main game, not a surprising or great ending, but satisfying enough. Why am I not in a rush to uninstall? Because the Survival and Biohazard modes are solid zombie invasion fun, and there's a bonus rainy industrial area map in biohazard after you finish the story.",

Hey big publishers, that trash dev is smarter, than you! Next, the game is actually less linear than Call of Duty while being significantly cheaper and the story isn't that much worse either. That out of the way, the game is still a C-movie. Voice acting so bad it hurts, shooting space zombies, that's pretty much it. Visuals aren't bad, surely not top notch, but not bad. And an FoV-slider (hey big publishers, this trash dev is still smarter than you). I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm still astonished that something that looks like a mobile port is a better port than A-titles. Anyway, it's an FPS about zombies in space, what's there to expect? Pop heads, in slow motion if you want and enjoy feeling brainless yourself doing so. The lack of a jump button is irritating though. Hey, at least the story is better than the voice acting.",

They invited me to review this game, and I'm sad to say I will, and they probably WON'T send me any more keys.  I tried to like this game, it was awesome, my first ever reveiw copy keys. Sadly the game left a horrible taste in my mouth. Based on their mobile game, it still feels as though it should be being played on my andoid, not my PC. Controls (specifically look sensitivity) were extremely sluggish, and the maps were barely 3 dimensional. I felt like I was playing a slightly more attractive version of Wolfenstine 3D.  The theme is ripped straight out of dead space, your in some sort of spacecraft and their are zombie-like creatures trying to kill you (original right?). Their is absolutely no exploration feel to the game, as it leads you along with locked doors and overly obvious waypoints (like I need an arrow filling 90% of my screen to tell me to go thrugh this door, it's the only one unlocked).  Being the chicken ♥♥♥♥ that I am (I still won't play amnesia or slender) I was nervous about playing a horror game. Was I ever wrong, I get more nervous playing minecraft this this poor game.

I would have rathered them be harder to kill with less zombies than easy to kill with so many zombies that you have no reaction time. That said, the game makes a fairly decent atmosphere where you can dive in fairly well. All in all, it was a fairly good game that I enjoyed playing.

Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:  Gameplay: 9/10 (classic Controls for PC and you feel the comfort of PC´s!)  Graphics: 8/10 (Improved on PC, also the Android already had amazing Settings when set to Ultra on my sgs3)  Support: ?/10 (never used on Pc but on Android, since on android the was a Error occouring in a Checkpoint where it did crashed. The Team never responced personally but they did improve the Android for my Suggestions and now it also works fine on Android! I´ll leave it out of Impression for Rating)  Price: 8/10 (I can´t believe when i saw it was that cheap for such a well made game that want´s you to bring the Retro gameplay with new Zombie Style)  Story: 8/10 (great but short! I do not want to tell what there happen hehe)  Sound: 8/10 (As on Android it´s also great on PC and on my 5.1 Surround-System it just Sound´s so awesome!)

Survival missions, replying finished levels and more upgrades than you can afford to do just through one play through gives some replayability for those looking for it. There are better guns than the 4 you gets during the game, my guess is they are for the increased difficulty on the new game plus and to keep interest beyond the short single player storyline.",

            "review_text": "for an indie zombie app game i recommend this, its a good game but its not excelent ether however there are worse app indie games then dead efect out there and this one is decent anyways lets start whats good.   what i like:  - a weapon shop. you can purchase zombie slaying weapons with credits or gold bars the shop contains weapons from pistols to machineguns to ravage the undead aswel as upgrades purchases to improve your guns, not enough? wel why dont you take the chainsaw and slice yourself trough the horde, still not enough? well dont be disappointed because you can instead take out the big guy (and yes im refering to the f'ing minigun) and mow the horde down.  - different varieties of the undead. there is a variety of zombies in this game not so much as any other zombie game but enough that will try to feast on you. from regular zombies to minigun wielding zombies.  -suit upgrades there are certain levels that has suit upgrade stations wich gives your character upgrades such as: more health or stamina.  -random drops random drops happens rarely when you kill a zombie sometimes they give you gold bars or sometimes they give you a weapon or an weapon upgrade. (a weapon or a weapon upgrade drop is very handy)  - survival and biohazard gamemodes in survival mode you take on an endless horde of zombies, your goal is to get a highest combo possile and to survive till the timer runs out, youl be rewarded with credits (amount based on difficulty) biohazard is pretty much the same as survival exept its wave based and without timer that can run out, you win the game by surviving all waves, and just like survival mode youl be rewarded with credits with addition to gold bars (amount based on difficulty and length of the gamemode) before you start a match you can choose the length of the gamemode and the difficulty   - new game plus there is new game plus wich you can take all of your unlocks to a higher difficulty if your tired of the difficulty your on.  whats decent:  -12 levels campaign the campaign was fun to play but it isnt that special compared to other zombie games but its not bad ether for a 5 euro indie app game it was decent enough, for those who wants to play there fav campaign level again you can do so by choosing level select there you can replay the levels while still keeping your unlocks such as your weapons and its upgrades.  now lets talk about the bad things in this game:  -low amount of gold bars drops the gold bars that are getting dropped by zombies are very low on amount youl get only 1-2 each campaign level while you can get 8 if you play biohazard and if you set the game mode length to long and difficulty to medium grinding that is just way easier of getting golden bars then just doing the campaign all over again if your saving for a gun that cost allot of gold bars.  -OP kamikaze grenade zombies these guys are tough, armored and anoying as hell one of the most dangerous zombie types in the game, these guys are gona make you swear allot in this game because they can instant kill you with ether trowing a grenade at you with a frontal hit or suiciding near you they are hard to kill since they wear a body armor there only weak spot is their head but its hard to aim at if hes accompanied by a bunch of zombies so focusing only on them isnt easy their damage realy needs to get nerfed because they where the main cause of my deaths in the game.  -paying credits to get revived this is defindly one of the bad things this game has when you die you dont get to spawn near a checkpoint like most shooters do, instead it gives you the option to pay with your credits (and the costs vary) and be revived to continue where you left of or to restart the entire level, yes there are no checkpoints in the levels so more reason to hate those OP kamikaze grenade zombies.  -cramped rooms theres allot of times that theres to much zombies in small rooms or hallways wich youl get anxious, and its hard to combat them that way as you will get easy cornered and ganged with no escape.  low stamina and batterys: your stamina and baterys run out way to fast and its reloading takes way to long long enough for a zombie horde to corner you or to suprise you in dark areas.  wel that was it, like i said above its a decent game for 5 bucks youl gona enjoy it for what it is but i prefer to wait till its on sale then youl get a good deal out of it i personaly enjoyed and liked this game and im looking forward what the developer is planing to add in the sequel dead effect 2 wich i have sadly heard that it will be free to play unlike the first game wich is unfortunate. have a good day all thx for reading  oow yeah almost forgot developer if you read this for the love of god nerf those anoying OP kamikaze grenade zombies if your planing to bring them back in dead effect 2.",

I don't know or remember if it was more than $5 when it was first released on Steam but its current price is pretty damn reasonable for this game. Its main campaign is about 4 hours long on Medium difficulty and it has quite a few extra game modes and difficulties to play on afterwards. It has something like 10 or 12 weapons, mostly guns, and has a pretty good upgrade system. You have 2 special abilities which both work well in the game and on harder difficulties it is pretty challenging. Its graphics are well done all things considered and plays quite well. When I first started playing it had some nast mouse acceleration but once I turned that off it was fine. There's no Jumping in the game but thats only a problem if you get swarmed by enemies and the enemies themselves have a little bit of variety. Theres your average zombies and about 5 or 6 variations of zombies. Theres only 1 type that is REALLY annoying but the rest are fine but you kill them all in basically the same way so theres not much variety to the game play itself from the zombies.  Its hard to describe but the game is fun and if you just want to play a mindless shooter that is enjoyable, nice to look at and not overly difficult then this is a fun little gem for $5. I did enjoy my playthrough, i'll probably come back to it at some point and most of the guns are unique and varied. The weapons themselves control well and are fun to use and as said before are all upgradeable. The sound effects and animations on the guns are very well done and give the game a pretty visceral feel. The story of the game is pretty bland and uninteresting but it is kind of silly at times which is enjoyable. Theres only a few boss fights in the game and they're nothing to write home about.   Pros - - It costs $5. - Decent graphics and fidelity. - Nice sound design. - Good amount of weapons that are mostly distinct. - Animation quality is good. - Voice acting isn't as bad as I'd expected. - Upgrade system for weapons and skills. - Extra game modes and difficulties. - Decent visual settings menu. - Deliberate combat - No microtransactions. Its good to see mobile ports that recognize the difference between platforms.  Cons - - Repetative gameplay. - Anticlimactic boss fights. - Weak story and weak ending. - One very annoying type of zombie. - Female character has a clearly male breathing sound effect when out of breath from sprinting. - Mediocre level design. - Annoying respawn mechanic. You can restart a level for free but respawning in the level from where you died from costs in game currency.  All in all for what this game costs its worth the investment to me. The combat feels good and is deliberate, you have to make your shots count! The zombies can pose quite a challenge at times but not too challenging if you don't want it to be. And like I said this game has some pretty good replay value and potential. Dead Effect has a lot of ups and downs but I feel its positives definitely outweigh its negatives and is worth asking price.  Numbers don't mean everything, and I don't like giving a score but if I had to give it one i'd say Dead Effect is a.....  6.5/10",

Its a space ship game, with zombies, you kill them. That's it. Oh you can use keycards, what innovation. Weapon selection is exactly what anyone who has played a FPS game will know (junk, then pistol, then shotty, etc etc). It feels very sluggish, nothing seems smooth with this game. That's part of its cheapness, it feels like one of those budget games in the supermarket than you have never heard of before, often come in a “ACTION TIME” series full of cheap rubbish and the odd old time classic that clearly just ran out of copyright and is considered abandon ware.   Its not a game you will hate mind, I do not want to give that impression. Its so utterly generic and dull that I doubt anyone could be too annoyed with it. Personally I consider that the worst thing a game could ever be, boring. The sluggish feeling really starts to grate though, the “zombies” react the same to your shots, so even what little it offers is marred by a poorly put together cash grab.",

Sometimes I get tried of playing a game after getting killed over and over and I want to play something simple where I don't have to do a lot of thinking. This game is perfect for that. This game is a lot like Killing Floor but I like it a lot better!  This game has one major flaw for me. It remimnds me of Just Cause 2. I finally just gave up on that game and I will never buy 3. The problem is that you have a little timed puzzle every once in a while you have to solve to get past it. I'm 66 years old and my mind is not as fast as it used to be. I had to go back and start over on easy. Despite starting 3 times it topk me 16 to finish it. I would call this a $20 game. If Dead Effect 2 comes out I won't spend much more than that for it.  This is still one of the more enjoyble games I have played!",

Pros:  zombies crawling zombies modifications on weapons  cons: first three maps are very linear. controls are feeling a bit clumsy - like being in a slight sedative state. Even applies to nade throwing. no jumping option (sedative state) running feels weird (sedative state) reloading at the speed of someone looking for change (sedati...aahh f. it.).  At least the name fits: Its a real dead effect.  ",

            "review_text": "It was fairly entertaining. For a total of the 4 hours I spent playing this game. Once you've played Biohazard and Survival, the story is irrelevant and pointless to play. Pros and Cons time. Pros: -Good graphics -Nice weapon design -Fairly decent soundtrack Cons: -Very limited amount of weapons in your loadout. 2. -Could have way better voice acting -Has WAY too many enemies in one room. There's like a hundred in a small room, and a thousand in slightly bigger rooms. -Often repetitive gameplay, such as rushing into a room with enemies in it. Read the previous con for details. -Has enemies in literally every room you enter, which makes no sense in any way. -Stolen sounds, an example is the SPAS-12 (forgot the name of this in the game) sounds. They're stolen from the shotgun from Halo. -Complicated weapon names. This is bad because you forget the names, and you get these random upgrades and you have no idea whether to be happy or disappointed. -Promises a lot of gore. Which it lacks.  The Cons list goes on for a while so I'll stop it here. But their tactic for sales was a cheap one. Not too long before this game came out, the Doom reboot was confirmed. This got people excited for getting a game that you go around and destroy everything in. But they had to wait so long, so what these guys did was ripped off the old ones and mixed a bit of Doom 3 in there, and added new graphics. Therefore people would buy it constantly because they would need something to fill the Doom gap. Little did they know, it was not entertaining after a while. Short storyline compared to the one of Doom, especially in terms of time. Think about it, this game doesnt even have a 5 hour campaign, and Doom has a 13 hour one. This game has no multiplayer which makes it even less playable. Doom's got one where you can even create modes rather than be restricted to certain ones. And enemy creativity? Doom passes this by thousands of miles. Just think, it just so happens that theres chainsaw wielding zombies like in Doom 3, and shirtless fat zombies which are, again, from Doom 3.",

But I will say, blowing up zombies is fun, as it is in nearly every other zombie killing game. It's like someone put killing floor in space and tried to give it a story.

Gonna do a play through with the basic weapons cos they are just a lot of fun and then try some of the other weapons. Just wanted something to pass the evening with but ive a feeling i'll be playing this a lot more.  Simple fun &amp; crazy value in the sale, 9/10 I would shoot the zombies again :)  Edit: Finnished the story line on Medium.. swapped up to Hard &amp; Still loving it. Going to bed at 12.. $h*t its 12 already.. gonna go at 1.. God dammit its 2 already.. must get sleep!

The infinite melee weapon is also cool, zapping zombies and making their heads explode is awesome. Game has a simple upgrade system between levels that does the job of making you feel like you're making progress with your arms, even if it doesn't bring anything new to the table.

            "review_text": "Summary: Casual Dead Space, but with bullet time instead of horror.  The Good:  - No bugs (at least, not for me). These devs know what they are doing from a programming standpoint. - Nice graphics. - Weapon upgrades are fun. - Secrets to find in the game (Orbs, tablets, money) keep the player exploring - very Metroid, nice touch. - Short. Doesn't outstay it's welcome (the reason I stopped playing Dead Island, it just draaaaaaagggged...) - WAGNER. IT'S PARTY TIME! - Gameplay. Those grenade zombies made me think about room positioning and you can use them against the other zombies if you are smart about it - definitely a bit of depth that kept me interested there. Bullet time isn't a get out of jail free card but rather an aid to aiming, which is all it should be.  The Bad: - It looks like Dead Space, but it doesn't feel like it. No horror, no claustrophobia, no near-death experiences. This is only 'bad' if that's what the developers were going for, but it's clear that the aesthetic is definitely 'heavily inspired by' that game. - More Plot? It plays like a casual zombie shooter and so lacks long term engagement, but then there's WAGNER and the lore tablets dotted around the place. I feel like the developer could have done a little more with the plot and made it more interesting. Compare it to, say, Dead Space 1 with the whole Marker thing and the gradual revelation of the source of the zombies, and there you have much better engagement  I think £3.99 is a fair price considering the enjoyment I got from it. Definitely worth it if it's on sale, you won't be dissapointed.",
