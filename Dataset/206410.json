            "review_text": "Crazy Machines Elements is a 2011 game from the Crazy Machines series, could be called 'Crazy Machines 3'. It's a game of Incredible Machines genre, where you have to solve the linear puzzles by placing lacking elements in the contraption. This game also came out for Xbox 360 and PS4. If I am not mistaking, those versions had leaderboards implented, while Steam version doesn't make use of any online features. Even achievements are done in game itself, no Steam ones.  And presentation is really great here. The graphics are really amazing. Well, sure, maybe technical side lacks whatever graphics-crazy people are hyped over nowadays, but with more colrful and nice art style it gives us incredibly atmosphere. Each element appears more of toy-like, jolly for eyes. Thanks to that, you can tell away what contraption is about from the first look, unlike Crazy Machines 2 where you had to focus to tell away what is what. Well, game sure doesn't try to be too realistical, you suck UFOs into vaccum cleaner there after all. Music playes it safe. Nothing terribly original or memoriable. But it's great and doesn't repeat often, helping you to immerse yourself on thinking over the puzzle.  The game takes place at outdoor placed, like Professor's backyard, where he screws gravity up with his inventions with no care for neighbours. Professor himself finally took care of his hair and rarely appears in the game itself, not even talking to you anymore. Actually, there isn't even hint on intro plot for puzzles anymore. Previous games had little instructions written for each puzzles, like 'I need that basketball to 1v1 Einstein'. But that's not something people will miss anyway.  Outdoor enviroments not only give you gorgeous scenery, but you also can't place elements just in air. You can place them only on the walls, in whatever way they are placed. The layout of the wall can also give you visual clues to help you. And you will have to appericate that, as there is no hints system in this game. You will have to figure it out on your own and with visual clues. At least it doesn't have cheap puzzles with ridiculous solutions like Crazy Machines 1 does.  Gameplay-wise it's somewhere closer to the first Crazy Machines. If you don't know, Crazy Machines 2 was more focused on building and connecting complex systems of gears and pipes and lasers. Elements reverts gear system back to simplicity of the first title. Completely removes steam pipes. Less things to do with laser. Perhaps it tries to focus more on physical puzzles, removing every other fluff and 'time-wasting' parts. Even dominoes aren't in this game. It does add few more elements and focuses on Elements. Well, or more exactly electricity and fire. And how bolt of electricity can set things on fire. And wind messing your experiements up too. As said, think of Crazy Machines 1, with slightly different focus. At least I don't miss having to decide if I need small, medium or large gear in CM2.  Oh, and now description of each elements shows you a bunch of icons too, that explains it's special properties, like 'can be set on fire, can be tied to rope'. If you get stuck, feel free to check each elements. Perhaps you will find out that some element is electricity conductor too.  Oh, and bonus. Instead of providing bonus objective, there are now golden gears placed through the puzzle level. They have to be touched by elements to be picked up, and you should get them all to count puzzle as 100% complete in a proper way. It's developers way of making sure that those who want to fully beat the game have to fully find the most complete solution. But I have to say, in some puzzles I found some elements aren't needed to solve them. No idea.   Didn't go without technical flaws though. While it's not as broken as Crazy Machines 2, it still got some small stuff. Mostly, rare cases of physics bugs. When placement of unrelated to chain reaction element may lead to change in behavior of another object. I also think that in rarely I encountered some slight placement-grid part, where element seemed slightly misplaced on the grid. Could be just me. But sometimes it may be good to restart the puzzle fully, just in case.  The game has three modes to play:  Puzzles - Your classic Crazy Machines puzzles where you have to place given elements to solve the contraption. There are 100 of them, plus 40 from DLCs.  Challenge - Now that's something new to the series. For those who complained about linear puzzles. Instead you have simple goal and then given full list of elements, with some of them locked for sake of challenge. And you are given 2000 or so points that you spend by placing elements of different costs. Game also tracks the amount of elements and time it took you to beat the challenge. The less the better. There are around 20 challenges, plus 10 from DLCs. They are either easy, designed for sake of getting high score, or quite a tough nut to crack. Lost of placement tweaking around. I know that consoles has online leaderboard for this mode, so you could see all the creative ways that players solved challenges by. But in Steam version you will not challenge anybody, I am afraid. Just beat the stages. Not really fan of this mode myself.  Editor - Your usual sandboxish editor that allows you to build contraptions. Some silly fun, I guess. You can build proper puzzles too. But there is no online feature to share your creations. I didn't even find the file where puzzles are saved. So, I am afraid, you may not have fun with community works and not going to awe online friends. Dissapointing.  So, in conclusion, Crazy Machines Elements, while not being true continuation of Crazy Machines 2 ideas, still delivers. Combined with presenation, it's one of the best Incredible-genre games you will find on the Steam. Not to mentioning that it doesn't have technical problems of CM2, nor cheap ridiculous puzzles of CM1. So, all the fun.",
