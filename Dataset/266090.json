            "review_text": "It looks good in the video and the notes seem intriguing, but for a a game that you play once, this should be free. It's an interesting educational tool that should be flushed out much more fully. The really is one task - determine the wavelength of a radio signal. The description makes it sound like there are more of these types of puzzles, but there aren't.  Even the surrounding terrain, which is supposed to be from Curiosity, is very low-res and could easily be improved upon.  All told, this looks like a 3D game kit's demo rather than a true game - even educational.",

            "review_text": "Starlite: Astronaut Rescue is a 2002 tech demo for... oh wait. Nevermind. It's a 'mini-adventure', sporting 'Unity Terrain Mars Environment and Shadows, Futuristic advanced rover setting, advanced biosuit space suits, professional voice acting, realistic physics, original story and dialogue; and advanced robotic navigation'.   Every single one of the aforementioned features are over-exaggerated. This  cough  game  cough  is what you'd expect from one of those 100 Games on 1 Disc compilations for Windows 95. It's truly awful, but luckily it lasts only 15 minutes.  My single positive for this title is that I encountered zero bugs/issues with my short experience. But, bugs/glitches are directly proportional to content, and so this is expected.  In your short experience you'll control a rover and a human character. The looking action is awful, and movement is just as bad thanks to really terrible mouse acceleration. It feels as if the player is on ice. This problem is disguised as 'realistic physics'. It's annoying, plain and simple. Jumping and staying in the air for 2 seconds longer, and walking with longer strides is realistic physics. Not releasing the W key and waiting 2 more seconds for your character to come to a halt. Eugh.  The story is a generic rescue mission, which is outlined in the title of the game. Going along as usual, someone had an accident, you have to find them by completing abstract tasks and finally you're rewarded by landing back at square one. There are a grand total of  three  6th grade maths problems that need to be solved, a 30 seconds crafting bit (with a cluttered interface) and then a short driving and positioning part with a rover. Oh and someone said some words at one point.  Avoid.",

This 'game' is really a technology test, and should have never been sold. if they needed funding, they should have used Project Greenlight, and not sold game demos.  This replaced my postitive review from Feb 2014 review back when it looked like Project Whitecard might atually extend this into a full game. Two years later, and nothing at all.... I was *supposed* to be part of their game testing team, and I'm yet to have any new released to test. Go figure. Just as well though, this company is dead to me now.",

It's just a slow, linear, boring mess of 'walk to target'. The most entertaining part of the game is operating a calculator, to divide the number 3 by some things. I'm serious. Literally every other task in this game is 'walk to the glowing spot on the ground'. The dialog is painful, and the voice acting multiplies that pain exponentially. On top of that, it's got a lot of small bugs, lots of irritating interface bugs. This all adds up to make the experience as disappointing as I can imagine.  Here's a list of some things that are more fun: - shopping for car insurance - waiting in a dentist's office - sitting in a puddle on a cold day - that thing with the baby and the fire in The Stanley Parable, all 4 hours of it - making 20 boxes of minute rice - walking back and forth in a small room  Nasa, Whitecard, I am disappoint.",

I do hope this isn't representative of things to come with Astronaut Academy. Barely even passable as a mission-0 game tutorial. There's supposed to be 20 minutes of game intro here, but it's all 'things move slow here' artificial padding, with barely 5 minutes of content extended by boredom.   Along with the poor scripting, the controls are horrible. Play it with a controller or don't bother. The mouse mode doesn't even trap the cursor, so get used to accidentally clicking away from the game window while trying to turn.   The only point of hope I see here for the continuing Starlite project is the visual design. While not AAA-level, the designs are interesting and engaging. And if the robots look a little cartoony... well, real space assistant robot design is headed that way anyway, if Japan has anything to say about it.  Bottom line, even as a sneak preview, this should never have been released on its own. And certainly not for purchase. As part of a much larger game, this would simply be a poorly-designed tutorial, and could mostly be ignored. On its own, there's little to balance out the horrible.",

            "review_text": "It's a bit buggy, and as of this writing it only contains one mission that is 20 minutes long, but it seems the developers are hard at work adding a multiplayer level and more stuff to do. The game is rough in a lot of ways. Graphically it's sub-par, flat textures, stiff and/or missing animations, very low-poly models; this may make the game run better on a wider variety of hardware, but it makes it look rough, even for an indie game. The controls are floaty and slow, though that may be by design given the lighter gravity of Mars. The gameplay consists mostly of 'walk here and press E/LMB', so it's not the most intense or involved game, and although you're on a resuce mission to save a pilot running out of oxygen... there is never a real sense of urgency.  Still, all that said, it's somehow charming. And it's cool to see a non-violent, science-based video game, even if it's just a rough-edged 20 minute sampler of what the developers have planned. If it were more expensive, I might judge it more harshley, but for the price, I think it's still worth it even given all the issues mentioned above. If nothing else, to see where the developers take it.  But be warned, if you don't like unpolished games, you should probably stay away.",

Fluid movement and controls (except for a problem with turning in Linux which hopefully should be fixed soon). A decent score to listen to and more. Plus in colaberation with NASA they plan to add 50 or so more activities/quests.  Definatly worth a try!",

Graphics isn't that awesome but not too crapy either. Look at the images and video and you already saw everything of the game, it is really short, i did bought it for a laugh, i was hilarous xD  I don't recommend this if your low on money, this is not really a game but a short project test.  I did liked the music when you driving the SAM, but it was a little too short.  I would give this game a 3/10 for the originality",
