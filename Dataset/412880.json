Tried playing it today after not playing for a while because I missed how fun it was, but was just disappointed.",

I then picked a map to try and earn some money, and it felt very alone and desolate. Not to mention you earn money pennies at a time, IF you don't tap the edge of the track. Was in the middle of finally holding a drift that was more than just a slalom, and the car flipped into the air and rolled for about 12 seconds. That all said though, I feel this game has potential somewhere down the road.",

Good thing is there's enough Japanese cars available, like the famous AE86 and RX-7, as well as my favorite cars Nissan Silvia and Skyline GTR, it's like Initial D, though Akina is obviously unfinished. Also with the highway track and the Devil Z, it's also Wangan Midnight.  I'd give this game 6/10",

No vinyl, No exhaust, No neon lights, nothing so that you can make a real JDM car. The only thing positive about this game is the sound effects. I hate that i wasted money on this game, so i recommend that you dont waste 5 euros on this game, until the game gets some major updates and more content. its not worth it. I give this game a 2 out of 10, but only because the sound effects are good, but if the sound effects was as broken as the rest of the game, it would be a 1 out of 10.",

Firstly im sure that there would be people willing to help you with the game if you let them. That way you can get more done. Likeeee...

Game play: 7/10 The gameplay takes some getting used to, but when you get the handling down the drifting is fun and the car mods are fun too, although drifting feels like it's on ice. Graphics: 6/10 The graphics are decent, except for cockpit view. Story: N/A Multiplayer Experience: 10/10 This game's community is small, I won't lie about that. But, the community on this game is one of the best communities on any game I've ever played. They're willing to tandem, drag, train, and help you on a moments notice. It is some serious fun. Single player Experience: 8/10 Think multiplayer mode without the people. It gets repetitive. Overall (Average): 7.75/10 This game has a lot of potential and is already a decent game. Some of the best fun you can have for 7 bucks. The devs regularly update it with new content and features. Oh, there's also a track editor, so there goes even more hours of your life. ",

The concept is great, you have control over camber and offset of the wheels, you can tune the car (not as fine-tuned as possible, but certainly a nice amount) and the multiplayer is in theory where the fun really is. But all the issues take A LOT away from the experience.  At this moment, would not recommend this game. 4/10 Fix the bugs and it would easily be 8/10 or even 9/10.",

From what a few friends have told me there is alot of regular updates for this game keeping it fresh, there is a very basic level editor built into the game so you can even make your own courses though it would be nice if they allowed more objects and textures to be used in the Editor it is still very user friendly.  The only downfall i have noticed with this game so far is that online requires a decent connection or you will D/C after about 30 seconds with no warning, and you can only control master volume levels.  The first time you play the game it will seem very badly made hard to control and incredibly frustrating but if you keep at it and find a nice level to practice on (i use drift track 1's big open space at the spawn to practice without fear of bumping into things) until you are comfortable with your car.  There is a huge variety of cars of which none are liscenced so the skins are mirrored or emblems are chromed other than that some of the most popular drift cars appear in this game.

At only 7 euro, you get a fun, addictive and highly replayable game that is being constantly updated by the developers, at the time of this review, supporting even steering wheels with pedals. I've tried Logitech 920 and the feedback works just fine, the throttle has enough sensitivity, the steering is on point and the overall experience works very well. Also, for controller guys, the game allows the option to connect all kinds of third party PC controllers, as well as Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller. You will most likely not need a top notch PC for this game, as the Unity engine graphics keep it simple and the overall gameplay is not too sollicitating for your machine, so anyone can enjoy it. The develpoers are continuously updating the game's graphics and textures to work and look better, so no worries about that. The game itself is rather simple, consisting of car tuning and drifting it on 5 circuits at this time. Fortunately, the tuning is in depth, allowing you to swap engines and upgrade its components, such as the block, the turbo and the NOS efficiency. The gameplay is fairly simple, consisting of starting drifts in an aracadey manner then sliding continuously in order not to lose your combo. Some tracks actually require perfect throttle control to be able to keep the skid going, offering the game a certain skill-cap and keeping it challenging. The Multiplayer mode is a great chance if you want to practice tandems or simply have some fun with your friends, as well as meet new drifters. Aside from the scripters, trolls and bug exploiters which may sometimes appear on the server, the community is quite alright and it is unlikely you will run into any issues aside from the occasional server lag. Overall, even though the game feels a tad too much like an early access title due to its lack of content, its replayability and constant updates make up for this issue and offer the buyer an addictive and fun drifting experience. I highly recommend this game, as it is one of the better cheap and fun titles you can drop a few bucks and spend a few hours on. You won't regret buying this title.",

            "review_text": "This is an early access game (atleast I think it is), so I'll give it a bit slack. Plus I got only got this game for a dollar, so I can't expect too much.  As of right now, this game looks like the older NFS games (Between Underground and Carbon) but just drifting, with the controls being noticibly more refined for simulated racing, rather than an arcadey one. This isn't that bad, the graphics are surprisingly decent for an indie game and you can tell a lot of effort went to the cars and drifting mechanics. Plus there's also a legitimately decent driver camera and there's a good selection of popular modern and classic tuner cars to choose from.  One bad part is that the game is just badly optimized. I can run most modern racing titles just fine, but this thing struggles badly with framerate issues, even when I've restorted to almost minimal settings. Another problem is that the game's UI is too minimalistic and lacks crucial information (a pretty glaring problem for a simulator). Nothing there doesn't explain what you're suppose to do, how your tuning settings affect vehicle performance, or how races work. Sure, there's online explanations elsewhere, but the thing is; players aren't suppose to look elsewhere to explain how the game works. The game itself should be explaining the core game mechanics.  You're just suppose to go in there and either sink or swim and overall the game kinda just feels dead. Not the 'no players' dead, there's some multiplayer activity, but you have little to no interaction with everything else that the entire game feels souless.  Overall, its nice to look at and there is a lot of potential for this game, but the actual game just isn't fun right now. If you want a better low-performance racing game that has better drifting mechanics; I'd really just recommend playing NFSU2 or GRID 1 (granted GRID 1 doesn't have the tuning aspect but its' still leagues better, especially for a game that came out almost a decade ago).",
