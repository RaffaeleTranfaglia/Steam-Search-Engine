Mixing   Prince of Persia   with   Mirror’s Edge  , a Sega’s Master System color palette with NES tight controls,   Another World  ’s influences with   Yie Ar Kung-Fu  , a Radiohead inspired soundtrack with Bruce Lee’s awesomeness. A raised in the 80s kid’s warm dream that confirms Larry Stover as one of the most distinctive creators in the indie scene since Nicklas Nygren alias   “Nifflas”  ",

            "review_text": "Has great gameplay with a slightly broken fighting system    if you just spam down kick you can beat any of the basic enimies with 10 hits  . The music is great for setting the right mood, although I would like a different theme for the bosses. The only problems I have with the game are that it never explains wall running (more like a jump really), and the backgrounds, while charming, get repetitive. I got lost, user error though, so don't let that stop you from buying this great 2-3 hour game.",

            "review_text": "♥♥♥♥ this game. COMBAT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE I've played it for over 7 hours and I've come up with tree good things to say about it, the movement system is the perfect balance of realism and platforming, even interacting with other vertical walls and 'third' walls. The animations are so much better, actually fluid and yet quick at the same time. the soundtrack is really a step up too... 3 things that are nice when the game is about platforming... so to the rest of it  remember the first games where fighting was very simple, but actually fun? remember the last game where combat was pretty much do anything to the red guys, keep the blue guys at a distance, and mash and mash and mash against the ones that looked like underground fight club rambo? well now its even worse.   i dont know how this dev does it, WITH EACH GAME THE COMBAT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE.  he struck gold with the combat in the first one: punchy, easy to use hard to master, every enemy had a different style and move set to take them down.   then the second one where blocking was decided by a random generator, but you could still fight or fly over their heads  third game was bad, and had the fighting style listed above, but hey, it still had a blocking button!!!  with this game, the key-board and the controller comands are ♥♥♥♥ed AND THERE'S NO WAY TO CHANGE THEM (also a downgrade from jump Boxer).  with every game movement changes, and in the latest two COMBAT IS MANDATORY. the first one was a joy to fight in. second was less fighting and you could actually avoid entire groups of enemies, and hey in the last one did i mention the blocking function; i know it was half way functional!!!  let me tell you what this game is: its a nut shot simulator. no way to block or avoid it, you can run away all you want but sooner or later the enemies will pin your sorry ♥♥♥ down, with no blocking function, and blitz you into the pavement. then it really turned into nut-shot-sim when i found out that the farthest reaching move in the game was the standard kick and i started mashing more acorns than an august bound produce salesman!  im completely serious! it looks and feels like a kick in the balls any time that you are fighting.  the last straw came when i got lost. yes thats right in this balls to the wall, ball slapping, ball-APA!-loose-ah didnt even give me a hint.  and you need those hints to get into the now HIDDEN and partially LOCKED challenge courses.  see i seem to remember friendly NPC's in these games that would strike up conversations and tell you where to go or plot stuff... 'well, those were in earlier games'...DAMN RIGHT THEY WERE IN EARLIER GAMES!!!!! AND THIS CONSTANT DOWNGRADE IN QUALITY WAS FINE AS LONG AS A SENSE OF ACHIVEMENT WAS AT STAEK! in every game from this developer so far there has been the perfect balance of stuff to make me want to keep going. the game play, the movement system, and the visuals and the mood played off of eachother in the past. but no, not here; the insanely crap combat and confusing map design and stripping away key features DESTROYS the presence of the better qualities of this game  which leads me to the plot: game 1- master's dead and them supernatural gangsters are trying to kill you game 2- you mysteriously come back to life and get these epic platforming skills game 3- your a free runner in china and start halucinating that ancient chinese martial artists are trying to kill you  this game- your part of some weird martial arts gang that is now testing all the free runners on the roofs with mortal kombat style arena fighting and platforming challenges. beat bosses and stuff to get hints once. thats right, one single hint which is actually easy to skip because of all the button mashing you need to do in order to survive!  no, don't have the bosses repeat directions, this isn't like a majorly confusing repetitive pain in the crotch, or anything...  not to mention 1 boss that i fought (and managed to not skip his dialogue) said 'the door above me is now unlocked'... IT ♥♥♥♥ING WHAT!? there aren't any doors next to this guy! and there is no path leading directly up a few stories either. after mapping it out, my confusion was only strengthened by the fact that there are FOUR DOORS AAROUND HIM! 1 IS PRACTICALLY TO THE EAST and the rout to get there ISN'T really UPWARD and 3 are so far UP across the map, you might as well have put a door directly above the boss arena JUST TO SAVE TIME!!! AND THERE WAS ANOTHER BOSS ARENA THAT IN FACT DID HAVE THAT ARRANGEMENT! so the dialogue is either in the wrong place, or this level design of one door to the east and all the others being too far away and too hard/tedious to get to is ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!  if you as the developer do end up seeing this: do you know how to make games like this better  (1) a map, or some system of navigating. samurai_jazz was sprawling and complex, but anyone with half a brain could navigate it because it made sense, and was plotted (seemingly like real architecture). shin samurai jazz and jump boxer got away with janky architecture because puzzles and key hunting was usually confined to one area or a hub of some kind  (2) a block function that actually works. in the last two games, the block function doesn't even partially work for 'off hits' and the characters have no split second wind up... this would be bad enough, but most of the enemy fight moves require you to press either up or down with the block button to work. i can understand up for high kicks and down for sweeps and grappling but all kicks require down and all punches require you to press up!? well at least the special moves don't require an up or down modifier, but if there's not at least 2 or three frames of 'telegraphing' for each attack, then the directional modifier is useless and this one is unfair and sadistic... se nut shot simulator quote above  (3)friendly NPC's and defeated bosses that repeat what they say... maybe some vending NPC's selling drinks or T-shirts...  (4) make some real fighting controls. done  as for the players: if you want to know how to succeed then here are the final tips: (1) draw a map (or go to the guide section for this game and look at mine). get on microsoft paint and draw a ♥♥♥♥ing map of screen shots, even if the geometry makes no sense. (2) record all boss fights. the combat is mash heavy, and the IMMEDIATE text dumps are not a good way to communicate information THAT YOU CAN NEVER ACCESS AGAIN.  I finally beat this wanna-be free roaming mortal kombat in 2d, but only after 5 hours of playing while i was mapping it out. after an hour of the 3 previous games i was hooked. this beautifully animated mess just felt like another kick in the balls! every time i got lost or saw more than 1 enemy on the screen: WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!  WAS THAT CLEAR AT ALL? GOOD!  ... i know im about a year or two too late, but how did you release this game in this state?  i'm just going to spoil it here THE ENDING SUCKS!!! the gang of free running MK enthusiasts put you in challenge courses and they test you with strange alien teleporter drones, and in the last locked zone: they boss rush you and are so impressed with your fighting they say you can join the club, then everyone goes out for dinner... the ending wasn't even worth it...   it feels like blase was going for some kind of mortal kombat mythologies thing... and the ending wasn't even a real good mind ♥♥♥♥. after that boss rush, i was expecting it to turn out that you were joining some alien street gang or it was all really a means of recruiting informants for the CIA or something.  sorry blaze... your product still needs a lot of work. funny how the smaller in scope, simple in design, and attention in detail world of _jazz is still a better waste of time than this one... but still samurai_Jazz, shin...jazz, and jump boxer were good in their own ways, here's hoping for the next one...",
