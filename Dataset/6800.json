My tips are: read the F1 help menu in game and learn the keyboard shortcuts/commands. My other tip is, make sure you use multiple saves! This game makes you feel like a boss everytime you beat a level.  The only thing it stuffers from is a slightly outdated ui. It would be nice for the game to display the keyboard commands on the game screen rather than in an F1 menu. The amount of keyboard shortcuts is out of the realm of fast memorization. I actually took a pad of paper and just wrote down the keyboard shortcuts. This is only a problem because as a digital download you dont have the benefit of a nice printed user manual in front of you; something that this game originaly came with. Other than that this game is a must play for any methodical/stealth RTS fans. Works great on my win7 pc.",

            "review_text": "I originally played this game in what seemed like a different life; back in 1998 when it came out. I remember spending countless hours playing this game, and I remember it being incredibly difficult but loads of fun. It is very reminiscent of other strategy games of the mid-late nineties, but set in World War II.   You command a group of commandos, all with different skills and abilities. Each stage has different line-ups of soldiers and usually a different inventory. The spy can disguise himself as a Nazi captain, the Marine can dive underwater and commandeer an inflatable raft, the driver can control tanks, the sapper can place bombs and traps, etc. Some characters run faster, and only some characters can heal.   I will say, if you are looking for an easy play through and/or get easily frustrated, this game is NOT for you. It is very challenging and you die almost immediately if you are caught. You will find yourself constantly saving and loading, and I found it not uncommon to save/load around fifty times a map. It is stealth based and you will die if you go in guns blazing. Don't let this discourage you though, since it's a very fun game and gave me countless hours of entertainment.   When I bought this game here on Steam it was something stupid-cheap like 75 cents. Even if you only play a map or two, you get your money's worth to at least give it a try. It is of course heavily dated (I almost laughed when I saw the system requirements), but the value and fun is there. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.",

I can only find old outdated posts on the Steam forums by users that made fixes, but all the sharing site links are down and no longer working. THE GAME DOES NOT WORK STOCK ON STEAM. How they get away with reselling this garbage that plain doesn't work is beyond me. I've also read that these versions are 1.0, not even patched to the latest versions.  Once you get it working, if you do, the controls are god awful. You have to literally memorize 10 different hotkeys for each soldier. Unlike most RTS games, where if you click an attack on an enemy, your unit will close into range and attack. Not here. In this crappy game they stand there like idiots until you tell them to move with a hotkey, and then tell them to attack with another hotkey. By then they're dead. I don't care if it's an old game. I recall getting a demo on an old PC Gamer disc, and there were tons of RTS games like Command &amp; Conquer out by then. Whomever designed the UI in this game needs to be shot. This game was originally released in 1998, so there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for this. There is waaaaay too much micro management here for an RTS to where you were wishing it was either turn-based, or the controls were consolidated enough to where your unit weren't so worthless.  I guess after I fixed the speed as well as the saved games not working I now get to try to find something that will bind custom hotkeys.   Do not waste your dollar on this garbage because the time spent to get it all working will cost you more in the end.",

I was looking for something along the lines of Rush To Berlin or something similar and this is a far cry from that masterpiece.

You'll stab people, hide while their body is discovered (you won't have time to hide the body) and then come back to stab another.
