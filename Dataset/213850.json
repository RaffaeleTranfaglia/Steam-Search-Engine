You can only use predefined decks and take out or in cards that are already part of that deck.  Second: Sealed play is a joke...you get those 2 sealed deck slots but then you can't reset them if you change your mind or if you don't like your draft. Yes you can buy more slots but it doesn't solve anything.  Third: Fix steam overlay, this has been a problem for a long time and there's still no fix for it! Yes in some computer it can be 'fixed' by running the game as administrator, but it doesn't work on all PCs.  Forth: quite often is very hard to know which cards you have unlocked because after winning in multiplayer most of the times the card unlocked doesn't get highlighted.   For the people starting to play magic the tutorials are well done and will teach you well how to move and to understand game dynamics.  Beside this I have to say it was nice to get the promo card at my Magic store and it is always nice to play with my friends both online and IRL.",

I'm talking several dozen reminders an hour when you start playing campaign and try to deck build often. 3. When I clearly click on option that I played a lot of Magic, why do you still explain me mechanics like flying and trample and all of the tutorials? I said I played it a lot, didn't I? What was the setting for then? I could understand explaining only the newest. But all of them? Really? 4. I may be nitpicking, but how come the game doesn't properly recognize my PC settings such as monitor resolution? I've seen games old almost a decade do that thing.",

It has some very serious flaws, but MtG is normally very expensive and hard to learn, while this game is easy to get into (thanks to half-predefined decks) and very affordable during Steam Sales.  Campaign mode is a challenging, varied sequence of relatively static battles akin to a puzzle game. They're a great introduction to different deck types especially if you're unlocking decks manually instead of paying for them. Multiplayer is the heart of the game, but thanks to the only half-customizable premade decks it's kind of a rock-paper-scissors type affair in that victory is largely a matter of taking the right kind of deck into a match, and I've experienced issues with players disconnecting and each opposing side being replaced with a bot.  The 3D graphics are pretty, but unnecessarily reduce the compatibility with very old cards.  I find the normal price overblown given the huge amount of DLCs, but I had a lot of fun learning Magic: The Gathering through this game.",

            "review_text": "Magic 2014 — Duels of the Planeswalkers is a really good game, but it's not addicting as well. This is a game you'll happilly finish the campaign after some days (you won't feel like ending the campaign in the 1st days, for real) and play a few MP games before getting a little bit tired. You'll come back some days, play some more... but you won't get that feeling of 'OMG, I need to play this game so bad, pls lemme play it, ♥♥♥♥ off teacher, I wanna play Magic', no, not like that at all. Let's go to some specific points now Deck Variety: Pretty varied decks, we don't have only the monocolored decks we know we have double-colored and triple-colored as well. There are even TWO white decks. All of them have a different style of play, fitting most of the players playing style. Cards Variety: I expected a little bit more, but I'm by no means disappointed. We've got some quite interesting cards. Graphics: C'mon, it's not the most important thing in this game. The graphs are more than enough for it. DLC: It's cheap and it's worth it. You can use the 3 or 4 decks (don't remember) you gain to play in the SP as well as the MP. They're unique in this game. All of them are varied and we even have a really good elves deck in this DLC that uses some really old physical cards. Pretty good. Also, both the game and its DLC are cheaper right now. I'd buy the Special Edition if I were you, really worth it. Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is undoubtedly the best TCG we've in Steam. We've got a great variety of both decks and cards. The single DLC is amazing and the price is really cheap. Also, if you got money I'd recommend you checking out 'Magic Online', google it, it's very interesting, much more than this game if you want to make such an investment. That's it for today, thanks by reading guys. Feel free to thumbs up or down if you want, comment down below. Go play some physical Magic and win some FNM in your city!",

Wish multiplayer get more attention, but probably we should wait another year or two for a proper lobby system. And i wish i shouldn't have to buy a new version of a game every year.

Sure you can add or remove some preset cards, but it's just not fun.  Think about it if you want to have a full 'MAGIC' experence it could cost as much as $500 in cards. Why would a company digitize that game and charge $15 - $50.  The offline game is a linear set of decks, and nothing else. Most content is pay and see, meaning; after buying the game you must also buy content created at the same time as the game. It's not new content. It's pay for content.  This game could be like the 1990's 'MAGIC THE GATHERING' PC card game. You could have craft your own deck, or explored a gui rpg world like fallout or an elderscrolls game. Where fights could be settled with cards.  A magic the gathering online game could include the ability to play as other editions of the original game, or have a special mixed aditions play. In fact with todays technology a single engine could support multaple card games like pokemon, battle-tech, or the infamous my little pony. Think of TF2 and how it evolves over time, or the halflife engine which has multiple games born from it. you could have a main engine that lets you purchase the rights to different versions of magic as they come out, you could purchase an 'orange box' that may contain ;fallen empires, arabian nights, 16th edition, Erza trilogy, Portal, Portal2 etc.   But you don't. In fact you don't get much of anything in this game. And considering how good computer games of the same price are. There is no excuse why these yearly released magic games suck so much, except for one; greed.  I recomend you don't buy this, or any other magic card game for the pc. Especialy those yet to come out.

However, for the experienced Magic player, or even someone who prefers deck building in general, this game can be somewhat frustrating. You do not have the ability to create custom decks. Only decks you can create AND create are sealed decks, and all the cards in the game are from M14 and M14 boosters. You can't create decks from scratch and only crack M14 boosters. Most of the cards are the same anyways. The game's Intellegence in-game (NOT the AI Opponent) is sometimes lacking in ability resolving, since it's intellegence doesn't stem into human reasoning when playing the physical game. Sometimes it does weird things that isn't intended. Overall, it's a good game to play Magic when you don't have your cards or you're not in the proper enviroment, however, if you want the full experience and the real deal, buy Magic cards or play Magic: Online (95% exact replica of the physical card game but in online format).  6.9/10",

            "review_text": "Game: Magic 2014 Summary: Difficulty out of whack, sealed deck hardly justifies cost. The rest is good. Rating (5/10 = failure): 6.5 Multiplayer: Yes Completion: 14 Cards: No Cloud: Yes Cost: 5 USD  If you played the other Magics, you know the drill. This isn't much different; just some rebalanced decks based on previous theme decks. That said, who in the world did the testing for this game?  The first few battles are pretty standard. You get to pick between a monogreen or monored deck (both of which are kind of on the weak side). Battles are a little harder than normal, but perfectly doable. And then suddenly you are pitted against a monowhite weenie deck. Those are brutal in just about all Magic editions! It's not even a special deck; it's just some random unnamed mook. Green just isn't fast enough, and red will exhaust its instants with no good permanents on the field.  Once you beat that, you get to face... another white weenie deck. Brilliant. Following that, you get an entire plane that is easy, a few moderate battles here and there, and finally some decent challenges. Suffice it to say, the difficulty is out of whack. And I've been through the entire game with each and every (non-DLC) deck. The pattern remains the same.   The campaign itself is pretty short- around 30 battles (provided you attack the other optional planeswalkers too). I would have liked about 2x more main campaign battles set at a proper difficulty curve. That would have gone a long way in enhancing the experience.   Puzzle mode still exists, but it's not part of the campaign this time around. Most of them are pretty easy too with the exception of the last one. Not much else to say about that mode.  By now you can already tell there's going to be a Magic 2015, 2016, etc. etc. So I guess the only question is what's new? Sealed deck mode! Sealed deck is the most promising feature of Magic 2014... and yet it's also the least developed.  Sealed deck plays much like it sounds. You get a handful of random cards and make a deck any way you can out of them, and pit it against another sealed deck. It's great. But there's only like, 5 battles and a few boosters, and then you're done. Wut?  How easy and fun it would have been if we were allowed to make new sealed decks over and over, and in longer campaigns? But no. Sealed decks use your username as a seed, so you'll end up with the same cards every time, and to play with more sealed decks, you must purchase DLC slots for them. Yes, you must buy slots for more sealed play which is like a 1-hour game at best.  I understand games are a business, but this is just an insulting cash grab. I understand using seeds for multiplayer games to ensure someone isn't cheating using cards they couldn't possibly get using their name. But what I'm asking for is unlimited single player sealed play. Where's the harm in that? Oh, I'm sorry, replayability is for suckers. We can't have that undermining our real card game, now, can we? Players should be grateful we even included some form of sealed play. /eye roll  Anyway, I won't include sealed play in the final rating because it's optional and grabby. The base game is fine, and fun (with a horrible difficulty curve), but without a proper sealed deck mode, there's very little this game offers compared to previous installments.",

As an owner of the first 2009 version I can quickly say that it has been several improvements over the years. You have more freedom with the decks, as you are able to swap all cards from the preset decks out, and put your new and better unlocked cards in. The gameplay is still Magic 2014. Nothing to hold against them here, as they stay true to the source cardgame.   The decks are varied, and challenges you to try different gameplaying styles. Some are aggro, others are control, and some rely on specific strats. Each deck has 40 unlockable cards. Some of them are throwaway horsegarbage while other strengthens your deck signicantly. With the amount of unlockable cards you can see varians between how people choose to play each deck.   The multiplayer is lacking in content. Which is really Magic 2014 biggest weakness. With such a fanbase as MTG has, it should've been Stainless Games first priority to make the player vs player experience immense and filling.  Instead you get a bareboned version. Where you go into 'lobbies' with your opponent(s). Chose your deck and go. That's it. No ladders, no tournaments and barely no reason to play multiplayer other than playing against other human players.   Also the addition of sealed play feels like nothing but a tease. Here they could've done so much more. Maybe even made it into an arena (Hearthstone) type of experience.  Summary + Fun and varied decks + New Deck packs are being constantly developed added(tho at a price of 3euro per 2 decks) + Good AI, the best in the series so far + Lots of gametime if you want to try and unlock everything + Challenges and singleplayer campaign of decent length  - Multiplayer is bare boned - Sealed play is bare boned - Some unlockable cards are utterly useless - Somewhat clumsy menu and UI.  I would definitively recommend this to fans of cardgames and especially Magic: The Gathering. If you hate card games and/or lack patience, stay away.  It will not be like Magic online, which is much more advanced and challenging to both new and more seasoned players. So if you are a die hard Magic nerd, you would probably be better off with Magic Online. That said, this is a good entrylevel for completly new player.",

The first and foremost reason for that is that the AI is stupid as hell, and to compensate for that they get fixed hands... When you play about 5 games of it it becomes extremely clear that the hands are fixed. They always open in one of 3 or 4 ways (give or take). To me this ruins the game, because the only thing that you're doing the whole game is countering what your opponent is doing since they DID get the perfect hand whereas you're still stuck with 5 lands or something like that. It's extremely frustrating and rediculous. I had to lower the difficulty of one of the first planeswalkers down to easy just because he was getting fixed hands. Yes the rest of the game is surely fun, but just this simple thing ruined the whole game for me. A game like Magic 2013 is way better than this. Wherein the AI is actually good and can be challenging at times. Yes the game is a good way to get into MTG or have fun with MTG without your friends, but I'd still recommend Magic 2013 for that. It's actualy a fairly decent game, only the problem is that they released the EXACT same game, only slightly better a year earlier, called Magic 2013. Yes you don't have sealed play in that, but even in here it kind of sucks, it's not an actual draft tournament, and you can only do 4 games since if you delete one it turns out you get the same damn boosterpacks!

When zombies die and can be resurrected from the graveyard, half of the time the game will not allow you. It's the same with phoenixes or other after death effects.   Most of the time, it doesn't even feel like the game shuffled your deck. One match it feels like all the land has been put on top of your deck. The next it feels like every creature you ever had is on top of your deck.   For example. I used the card Flamebreak against a undying zombie card. It's supposed to allow any creatures to regenerate this turn. The zombie regenerated immediately. Later in the game, the undying zombie refused to regenerate when killed. There has been something like this in every single game I play. Where is the sense in this?   Exiling and regeneration also only seem to work half the time.   How does a game with this many bugs actually exist? I have played dozens of matches in this game. I only bought this game to play matches online with my friends, but every game just seems to be waiting to see who gets more bugs in their favor. I'd rather go back to texting photos of the card I played, than deal with this stupid game. I want my money back.",

Anyone who's even remotely interested in MTG should give this a try. it is a great way to get back into the game if its been a while or even if you are an active player it can be a fun way to experiment with the different card mechanics, test decks and you will enjoy the Planeswalker story in the campaign that is starting to really flesh out into a pretty cool story. it offers some interesting motivation to your games that are already very engaging. The nice thing about MTG is you can draw perfect cards or the worst cards from your library and lose either way. It takes intelligence to win and excercising that with the hand you are dealt is supremely engaging and satisfying. losing is sometimes frustrating but when you finally get your opponent down with a strategy that you engineered yourself it is extremely rewarding!",

Quote from the game description:   'discover what makes Magic: The Gathering the world’s premier trading card game'   Does that sound like it's directed at experienced players? This game is nothing but a rather long tutorial, designed to promote the real, face to face game to people that are totally new to the game... to give new, or indeed slightly inexperienced, players the chance to learn and try different deck types, discover what different attributes do, discover how to use cards together in a tactical fashion, all in the comfort of a Single Player mode (with a multiplayer option when you start feeling confident).  Keeping in mind what it's goal was, it actually accomplishes EXACTLY what it set out to do (help people like me get into a game I would have never had the nerve to try at noob level, face to face with strangers), and it does it in a very nice way in my opinion.  If you are completely new to mtg, like I am, then I'd highly recommend that you buy this game.  There is so much to learn and try to master with mtg that I really do think a single player game like this is absolutely necessary to give new players a thorough introduction and a basic, but still good, understanding of the game before they decide to head out and buy a kit or something.

            "review_text": "NOTE - This review isn't so much about the game but the decks featured. I don't have enough space for each expansion deck.  The base game comes with 10 decks. These decks range in colour and strategy, but some are clearly better than others:  WHITE  Guardian's of Light - This deck heavily features aura's and others spells that work well with aura's. It doesn't have very much removal, so it relies on the strength of its own creatures... or really, creature. It usually attacks with just one creature that can usually be chump-blocked. Thankfully, the deck has a good number of creature's or aura's with lifelink so you can stay in the game whether they chump-block or not. However, if your one super-powered creature is killed through removal, it's hard to come back. Losing a creature and 2+ aura's from just one spell means more mana-efficiency for them. Overall, a very strong deck if your opponent can't remove your creatures.   Avacyn's Glory - This deck's strength comes from numbers - and removal. This is a white weenie deck basically made from the Innistrad block. The deck works like a well-oiled machine, but can breakdown if a wrench is thrown in. This deck, if played perfectly, can win in a few turns. It can also play the long game with spells like Baneslayer Angel, and obviously, Avacyn herself. One of the reasons why this is one of the strongest decks is because it has many removal spells. This means this deck can stop creature decks in their tracks. Unfortunately, many of the best cards in this deck can only be unlocked if you buy the extra unlock key.  Without the unlock key, the deck is one of the strongest in the game.  BLUE  Mind Maze - Despite the name and Jace's usual mill deck strategy, this is a highly aggressive Illusion tribal deck. The deck is mostly creature-based and can win very quickly. The big problem is most of the creatures have the 'if targetted, sacrifice' clause. This can be a problem if your opponent has creatures and spells that can target your creatures. This deck has a few counterspells and a few freeze spells, but mostly relies on its strong agressively-costed glass cannons.   BLACK  Deadwalkers - This deck is a rather basic zombie deck that is very dangerous. Many of its creatures are expendable and can also come back from the grave. This deck also has 19 pieces of removal, and can keep killing your opponents creatures while it slowly withers away at their health. Some of the removal, like Tendrils of Corruption and Corrupt, also give this deck some lifegain.  All in all, this deck is probably the strongest of the base game decks.   RED  Firewave - This is Chandra's usual burn deck. It features a few Phoenix's with a decent bit of damage spells. While this deck can be good at removing small threats, it really suffers when dealing with anything bigger than a 4/4. It doesn't feel like it has any set strategy, and kind of stumbles between burning your opponent and punching them. It does get bonus points for its strength in multiplayer games.  GREEN  Hunter's Strength - This deck can be summed up with just 'creatures'. While it lacks a real direction, this deck can have its moments. It has a few pieces of situational removal and can overpower the game very early on. As the game draws on, the deck slows down a bit and the agressively-costed Kalonian Tusker's and Garruk's Companion's feel like dead-draws. The decks main drawback is that it has very little mana ramp, despite being a mono-green deck.  The deck gets a lot better once you've unlocked a few more cards, but evolve beyond 'Play Creature; Attack with Creature'. Overall, a decent deck, but can be foiled by a bit of removal.  Chant of the Mul-Daya -This deck is a fascinating ramp deck that has a few big stompy creatures to finish off. This deck really falters early game and can lose without playing anything good if you don't ramp your land fast enough. However, once you've got 6+ lands, the deck gets really dangerous. It has a few All is Dust's, which can really turn the game around. This deck suffers to most from removal. Even if you've ramped up to 12 lands by turn 7, you'll probably only have 2 big creatures that don't really have any means of protecting itself from solid removal like Doom Blade or Oblivion Ring. This deck is probably the best deck at top-decking a means of winning, though. In the end, this deck is the strongest if your opponent doesn't play any removal.   MULTI-COLOURED  Sliver Hive - Probably one of the most anticipated decks of the game, this White/Red/Green deck is a relatively new imagining of the Slivers from M14. This deck features a bunch of Sliver's as well as some mana ramp and small bits of removal. On paper, it seems like a strong deck. This deck can win quickly if you get all of the pieces assembled quickly and efficiently. However, this deck suffers once one of the Slivers are destroyed. Since they all build off each other, removing one can mean the difference. Even if they have no removal, you might still be unable to deal with them if they have one bigger creature than yours.  This deck gets a little off-focus when you add more of the unlocked cards. While this can diversify the deck, you start to lose your win condition as you start veering off the Sliver strategy.  Masks of the Dimir - This deck is basically a Black/Blue control deck. Its main focus is on discarding your opponents cards from their hand and chipping away at their health. Unfortunately, this deck really doesn't know what it wants to be: It doesn't have enough removal to really stop big threats and it doesn't have any counter spells to really control how your opponent plays. The only victories I've earned for myself was through attacking with my 4/4 flyer. Once it's killed, I rarely win afterwards.  A really disappointing deck; one of the weakest in the game.   Enter the Dracomancer - This Black/Red/Green deck's main focus is playing dragons. This deck has a decent bit of ramp spells that go into the few dragons (7) the deck starts with. It has a few weenies that can protect you and deal small bits of damage, but after a while, they're only good for chump blocking. They can later be used for the few cards that can Devour them. Similar to Slivers and Mono-Green ramp, this deck gets bowled over once you've destroyed the few big creatures this deck plays. Devouring the weenies sounds like the right thing to do, but it actually helps your opponent pin-point which creature to destroy. Removal is minimal in this deck. This deck does get better once you've unlocked more cards, but initially, this deck is weaker than the Dimir deck.  So there you have it: the initial ten decks this game offers. I hope this helps you decide whether this is the right version of Duels of the Planeswalkers or not.  I've even taken the liberty to rank the decks personally, based on how well each deck has played against each other:  1. Black - Deadwalkers 2. White - Glory of Avacyn 3. Blue - Mind Maze 4. Green - Chant of the Mul Daya 5. White - Guardians of Light 6. Green - Hunter's Strength 7. White/Red/Green - Sliver Hive 8. Red - Firewave 9. Black/Red/Green - Enter the Dracomancer 10. Black/Blue - Masks of the Dimir ",

Unable to provide access to the whole collection of cards available in the game, something that many Yu-gi-oh! and Cardfight Vanguard games strive for, really harms the experience.   And while they do provide a 'campaign' mode of sorts, the loose justification for battles is barely enough to keep the game interesting while losing yet again to an enemy that somehow has counters to everything in the premade deck. Other TCG video games tend to provide a larger selection of customization options that really give the player a chance to work out strategies to surpass a tough opponent.   On the positive side, the alternate modes do provide some fun challenges and reasons to keep playing. However, there's not enough there to make them last for an extensive amount of time. A disappointing fact as they would improve the game immensely.   The fact that not all of the rules are presented accurately, with many being wildly different than how they work in the actual TCG, cause the game to be a struggle to recommend for beginners or experienced players. Avoid this game, the MTG Online available directly through Wizards of the Coast is a better option to get a digital MTG fix.",

The tutorial is insanely good, and the visual image of 'the stack' is very good for people who have no clue how to visualize how spells resolve and in what order. I think the interface is very simple and easy to use for beginners and it would allow them to play some cards which are pretty expensive and that they would probably never get to play with like Umezawa's Jitte and Exploration. The decks are not really balanced that well, I think.

HOWEVER, it's another cash grab in a series that peaked two iterations ago. If you want to try out magic, buy 2012. This version is engineered to trick you into paying money. Unlocking cards is a chore, deliberately so, in the hope you'll give up playing the game in favour of paying to win. Each card in each deck is unlocked individually, whereas the decks in 2012 would unlock multiple cards of the same name, so that unlocking decks was a delight.  Worse still is the sealed deck system, dangled in front of us as in incentive to buy into this money farm. As you're hopefully aware, you get two sealed decks (which is no problem), you can buy more (which is fine and dandy), but you CAN'T EVER RESET THEM. That's right, you play with them once, and you're stuck with them permanently. Again, Wizards of the Coast decide to take huge slashes to replayability, value, and fun in order to try to get you hooked.  I've followed the series from the original, and the fun I've had with 2012 has kept me coming back until now. WotC has made it very clear that we, the gamers, are not important to them. You are essentially paying them $10 for an advertisement. The advertisement used to be good, but now it just feels like hollow marketing.",

But when 2014 went on sale, I gave in and bought it though I had low expectations. I never thought I'd be pleasently surprised by how much it has -actually- improved.   Firstly, I simply cannot gush enough about the implementation of the player into the storyline. Before, you just fought all of these planeswalkers without any real reason... you really didn't have a connection to them whatsoever, you followed -their- storyline without having one of your own. The game is a bit more immersive in that it actually includes you in the storyline. In the first duel you have with Chandra, she speaks to -you-, the player, and the information she gives decides your journey further.  The interface has cleaned up a lot: it's more streamlined and much less clunky. The menus are easier to use and cleaner. You can pick the lands you play for multi-colored cards, which is a nice addition. In battle, the phases bar look cleaner as well.   Graphics-wise, the cut-scenes were a little off. I preferred the method they've always used in the past: still figures and moving backgrounds. This time, some parts are animated and they look a little sloppy, as if they were created in the 90s. But it's not a huge deal. Some cards are animated, which is a really cool effect.  Other than that, you can expect the usual fair: new decks, new avatars, new game modes, etc. I've never felt any of the other games were comparable to the first PC Magic game, but this one I feel is the new standard.",

I myself have spent countless hours on it and personally love playing 2v2 online with buddies from my home state. (I move with the military a lot) Yes it has its issues with bugs, bad timing mechanics, and the on going cash shop, but ultimately I enjoy it and think its worth the small amount of cash I throw at this series once a year.  I think most of the criticism comes from the guys that want an experience closer to the real game. Thats why they have MTG Online on the official sites.

It's a quick campaign in that you can pretty much beat everything the game has to offer with opening one deck in about 25 hrs complete. But the fun it supposed to be in the challenge of learning all the decks that you unlock and how all their different pluses and minuses. SO then you figure to multiply that across the various decks thru the campaign. You do have to grind to get the decks to open up to their full potential, but what stat buidling game dont you anyway? So that's not really a valid point. I mean how much time would you spend in RL collecting all these cards anyway? Right now the entire season is available for less than what I would pay for a value meal, so as long as it's on sale I say go for it!

            "review_text": "I find this game to be a bit of a quandary. I love Magic, in all it's forms. I have been playing for almost 20 years off and on. It is indeed one of my favorite gaming obsessions. I love the game mechanics, the artwork, the deluge of new releases brought to us by Wizards each year. These are all fantastic things. However, and this is what makes a review for this game difficult, I think people miss the point with what Duels is trying to accomplish. This game is not made for the hardcore IRL Magic player. It is made for the casual fan, or perhaps even a beginner wondering what the game is all about. Don't get me wrong, the challenges and sealed deck play inclusive of this edition are geared at a more experienced player, but, minus those, this is an attempt to get people into the game.   Thus far, you may be wondering where I'm actually going to recommend this game, well patient reader, you have reached that fork in the road. I will very much recommend this game as it serves the prospective player on many different fronts.   For one thing, I have difficulty finding real life games of Magic to play. I have a busy and odd work schedule that prohibits me from being able to play at my local hobby and game stores. This fills the need nicely. One could say that Magic Online would be a better option, however, that title, though I do enjoy it, is a much more difficult entry to get into. The process of finding games is difficult, as is the ability to compete with others that have incredible collections to work with. I don't want to spend money forever just to have a chance to win a game. Duels gives players the opportunity to pop in and play a game quickly without the meta game that goes along with real Magic or MGO. I will provide no argument that the act of building quality decks is a huge part of the game. For me it is possibly more enjoyable than playing. I love looking through my cards and trying to come up with that next killer combo of cards. But, in adult life I rarely find the time to sit with countless cards at a table and do just that, or perhaps I just don't find it to be important enough to make the time. I don't know.  Regardless, this is a decent digital representation of a fantastic game. It gives quick play ability. The sealed deck mode gives decent, albeit limited, deck building for the first time in a Duels entry. The challenges, for me anyway, are indeed challenging, and very fun. I really enjoy the puzzle aspect of the challenges, and they are quick enough that you will want to try again and again until you beat them. I will admit I have not tried this year's campaign mode, nor the multiplayer, however, neither of those was my primary reason for purchase. I bought this for the Sealed Deck play. I wanted to see what they would do with it. While it isn't like playing for real, that's what MGO is for, it is a reasonable alternative at a much cheaper price point. I think it will likely be a good point for them to improve on with next year's edition.  I just want to end this with one more point to be made. A lot of negative reviews are being written about this game. I urge interested parties to download the demo before purchasing. This will give you a chance to see if it's for you. It may or may not be. I have a feeling that most of these negative reviews are being written by people expecting too much. No Magic product for $10 is going to give you a huge assortment of cards to work with, nor the ability to build custom decks to your hearts content. This product sits in a particular category for the Magic franchise and people need to understand that. If you want all the cards and the best multiplayer, go online and get Magic: The Gathering Online. If you want an interesting take on things in a quick and easy format, or want to learn to play the real thing, this is an excellent starting point.  Because everyone gives everything a number rating on here, I'm going to do the same. 8/10",

'Protection' from a card color on a creature doesn't grant said creature immunity to that color of card, but instead makes them invisible/unblock-able to the specified color.).

Magic: 2014 has immersive sound and much better controls than its 2013 counterpart, and should you use an Alienware while playing it, you'll soon realize that it will 'take over' your display. The LEDs will change depending on whether or not attacks are being made, if it's your or your enemy's turn, or if you're blocking.  That subtle touch went unnoticed, as my main setting is green, which is your 'turn's' color. I didn't notice until the enemy took a turn. It was a surprise that I welcomed, as it made this game unique.   Out of 10:  Style: 9, only because it looks similar to many of the Steam card games, and they could have done better, but did improve a lot. Sound and immersion: 10, although this game does not need it, the sound helps to immerse you especially if you've a headset. Uniqueness: 7, it played well and had a different playset, but something makes me feel like it's a bit repetitive on how they set their controls Playability: 9, I played this for a good time, not sure how long.

So as a vehicle to multiplay with other humans, this game is probably good? -- personally I would love to have constructed one of the great old decks I had played in the past. But I didn't want to buy or spend 100 hours making them, so I'm done and uninstalling until 2015+. ",

There is a cool feature where you build a deck from a random booster packs, but this part of the game is too short. It's fun to play through the main story although it can be a bit tedious. The controls are good, better than on systems. 7/10.",

            "review_text": "Way back then, me and brother bought a starter pack to try this out. We were left to understand the rules by ourself. of course this meant that our personal interpretation was often taken as self-interest ! Resulted in endless confrontation and frustration.   I started fro real with the 2010 PS3 version. Computers are great to teach you card games, no human interpretation. Sometimes the game wouldn't let you do something, that meant you misunderstood a basic rule. Even my bro came back to the game and we had lots of fun over the net, particularly on 2-headed giant.  I could play all the decks with 50% chance of aquiring an additional card for one in 2 win. Very addicting.   I know very little about programming, but I have a lot of experience with game making. I can assure you this is the simplest game you can program. The mechanics are decades old and playtested to the max, no further balancing is needed, the art litteraly copied from the card game. Why then do we get minor rehashed game engine year after year, buggy, unstable and slow (console is nearly unplayable due to loading).   I'm not even talking about AI, there is none. You can fake AI with rules but in the end, unless you write a rule for every possible outcome, you will get consistent mistakes. ie: If you are overpowered (50 beasts at 10/10, 200 health) the AI will stop playing. The game won't crash but the AI will draw 1 card, and disard 1 card at the end of the turn, period.  This is clearly a cash-in enterprise. It works. From what I can see, it runs on very limited resources. Bugs can only hope to be fixed in the next one or second advent. I have bought every game, hoping my experience would be improved by as little as 1%. It did. I can understand fixing the minor shortcomings would make this game 10 times more pricey to produce. Is it worth it? Of course not. But I strongly believe the community deserves it.  With all this said, I still recommend Magic. Don't fall for the obvious cash-in tricks buried amongst the really cheap deck unlocks (who needs foiled cards?, wallpapers, soundtracks ?)",

            "review_text": "This feels very awkward, as this is my first time reviewing... anything, at least publicly. So let's read how a socially awkward person writes a review for possibly hundreds to see openly, shall we?  I am a moderate player of magic, I know probably 70-80% of the mechanics to be classified as a decent player, and Magic 2014 has taught me more about a game I've already been playing for the past several years. New understanding to certain mechanics I've been fuzzy about or didn't understand when to do what, when, etc. If you are looking to get into playing magic, but don't want to invest in the paper game, and want to learn, this game is definitely for you, and a lot cheaper to start you off on.  I thoroughly enjoy playing this game, having paid a fraction of the cost of the full price, which is a huge plus in of itself. The amount of decks to play with, I still have a lot of decks to plays through, to see how my skills compare to many of the older 'meta' decks that used to be, and still are, very popular. If you are astonished by the amount of different cards in this game, you should see what the card archive on the MTG website has, literally thousands upon thousands, dating a couple decades back. With the amount of selection you have in Magic 2014, unless you are someone who plays this all day, you will have plenty to do on here, a sizeable compaign for the price paid (a little bit extra if you bought the expansion), with several different game modes, it will keep you busy for at least a little while. Having a little over 60 hours, I've only touched 1 deck thus far, out of 21. So if you are looking for quantity over quality, you don't have to choose, you get both for a much cheaper price than starting yourself off with paper cards.  A few minor gripes about this game, aside from your inability to actually build your own custom deck, which appears to be the biggest complaint about every other game, aside from the horribly rated Magic 2015 (the only seemingly good thing about 2015), is some of the decks that already pre-made, are broken in terms of how strong they are (card symmetry, strength of individual cards), where some decks just can't compete with others without drawing a really incredible starting hand. I myself have had to constantly restart duels, simply because the deck you are facing tends to have very powerful starting hands, or you seem to have every single action countered immediately, essentially forcing you to restart to not waste your time with a very bad start. While some decks seem overpowered based on their card mechanics and how well the deck is simply put together, there are others that are just the opposite, having such a slow start with horrible hands that you either have to restart, or just save yourself the stress and pick another deck to try your luck. There are also times, during Two-Headed Giant mode, 2v2 matches, the AI partner I have seems to always have a ♥♥♥♥ hand, while facing that same AI controlled deck, they draw beautiful hands that essentially win the game in under 10 turns. Whether it's due to the difficulty settings, I'm not sure, but it gets annoying losing to the same pair of AI opponents over and over, taking a break afterward. I have also noticed that I can unlock all but 10 cards for the one deck I've been playing most frequently. Whether those cards are hidden behind a paywall, I'm not sure on that either, but if that's the case, that is kind of upsetting, considering a lot of the great cards are in that block of 10 that I can't seem to unlock, and I'd rather not pay extra for a few extra virtual cards. I have paper decks to fall back on whenever this gets too much. Also, for me anyways, the game does crash out to the desktop from time to time, although not enough for it to be game-breaking.  Pros: -Solid gameplay -Numerous decks to play with -Multiple game modes -Tons of cards to get a new person acquainted -Decent tutorial for beginners -Lots of content in general for much cheaper than paper starting kits  Con: -Seemingly overpowered/underpowered decks -Derpy AI at times -Inability to create your own decks from cards you unlock -Occassionally crashes out from time to time (experience may vary)  All in all I give this game a 9/10. Great game to start you off into playing Magic, and much cheaper in the long run, unless you become more interested, and want to play in paper form too. If you can handle the few minor previously mentioned issues that I experienced, then this game might be a 10/10 for you. I know I enjoyed this game for the amount I paid, and I still do, and have no plans on stopping anytime soon. Good luck, and have fun everyone.",
