Personally I think that the old style and way the game was set out was better, you had more options with your avatar, you had the origonal digimon to choose from as your partner. The map and begining areas were diffrent, but I do lke the new tutorial and some of the quest lines though with thsis one.",

If this game had bad graphics, then why can't 80% of my friends play it because of it?  Look, i love digimon, and the game itself is fun! It's grindy as all hell, but with friends, it's fun and funny! I barely notice the bad english, and i dont blame them for not being able to properly translate the game.. anyway, for the pros and cons of the game..   Pros:  -Great gameplay -Ok AI -Good graphics -Great Comunnity -A sence of accomplishment when you get Digimon to ultimate/mega  Cons: -You dont get level up rewards, even with enough space in your inventory [Though that might be my bug..] -Doesn't let you say the silliest things.. like Devil, igm -If ya want more digimon, ya gotta pay like, 0.90 cents... which isnt much.",

I like this game a lot, had an amazing experience and was in a great guild for the longest time before we all disbanded to different games. Spent probably 1000+ hours on this game in the past and will try to do the same now ;D  The cons about this game out number the pros I will admit that.  1) yes you will get Dc'd a lot  2) Quests suck and when you get to a higher level they only get worse. (some will take weeks to months to finish, doesn't help that they're boring quests...)  3)Pay 2 win  4)Story is boring. Always skipped the dialogue.  5) constant grinding (I'm fine with it though if you know what I mean ;D )   I still think it's worth a shot to try out for your own personal experience. It's free to play just test it out.",

I'm still giving this a positive review since I have played many hours when the game was hosted by JoyMax and GameKing.  If you are a huge fan of Digimon, you WILL like this game! It has many Digimon that you can choose from, and it will most likely have your favorite Digimon you can level up.  Keep in mind, if you want a stronger Digimon, you might have to spend money on the items in the Crown Store. BUT...GameKing usually gives out a lot of free stuff (that's actually good stuff) if you just log-in and play. The longer you are logged in, the better the free stuff usually. Of course...it all depends on the events they are running for that month.   Here are some tips:  -If you want a stronger Digimon, get Level 5 Digieggs. (sometimes available during events) -Level 4 Digieggs are good too, in my opinion. -Make a party with people to gain XP faster.  The only thing I would like to see is current GameKing accounts connect to Steam. But once again, if you are huge Digimon fan, you WON'T be dissapointed. Yes, it's grindy sometimes for the Digimon you want, but it's well worth it in the end.",

I decided to play on a very old account I haven't used in years 'created during joymax time' and when I tried logging in it said the same thing 'abused the bug' how exactly is it possible to abuse a bug if you don't even login? So just a warning your account could be banned at any time too.  Their customer service is HORRIBLE. I sent them a ticket(Gameking)and asked the gms on this platform(Steam) to help me out.

You could only get digimons evolve them, and repeat, nothing more to add to the game. But that wasn't the worst, the worst was that, to get the BurstMode (usually the strongest evolution of the digimon) you need to buy the item from the store, with real money. Well, here it started to be a P2W game, but, it doesn't matter, some years later, Movegames got the game, and started to do, something even worse, now you have plenity of options to upgrade your digimon and tamer, but NOW it's 100% P2W game, and in addiction to that, they raise the money cost of the game currency, so, it's a P2W for people with more money then usual. Why do they need the money, if it's only for evolve the digimon, why would they care? Well, for that answer, i must say, now everything, it's buyable so, the dungeons and raids, are only for P2W, because you can't enter without your digi at max stats, well you can, but you will never win, so it doesn't matter. And now, they have started a server for Steam, but hey, we are talkign about the same garbage game, so, as i expected, the game is just the same, everything is the same, beside we can't transfer accounts from other servers to this one, so maybe we could try to make a legit game with less P2W, the others players, from the game, can make a nwe account and bug the game, cheating the game with bots, and ruin all the game, for the new players. Did i say bots and bugs? Oh, you didn't knew it? The game is free for bots and buggers, bugs like, they use costume skins and the dungeons are smaller/faster to do, auto bots that will farm all day for you, so you don't need to do nothing, money bugs, so the hackers have allways TONS of money to raise the in-game currency, and you, as a normal player, can't get anything, because of the super high prices. I played this game for like 6/7 years, and in the beggining, when it was only collecting and farming, it was fun to group with people and just level up for fun, now, you just need cash to play it.   Pros - It's Digimon; - Get friends to play, and you will enjoy the first week; - Nothing more good to add;  Cons - Full of Hackers; - Full of Buggers; - Everythig you need, it's in shop, you need to get it with real money; - P2W; - Everyone is AFK, you only see people (like real people playing) in Dats, that is when they need to buy things; - Dungeons and Raids are only for P2W, because they have all maxed, and you will only do 1% of damage, so you will not get anything from it; - It says Global Digimon, but it is divided between Brasilians and Indonesians, nothign against them, but they should get a personal server (liek Aeria for Brasilians) so we could all speak english or so; - No point on getting Burst Mode, because only 3/4 digimon are important to progress the game; - Really bad balanced skills; - Very poor diversity of Dungeons and raids; - REALLY BAD game for begginers;  And that's all, i was reallya ddicted to the game, some time ago, but with all these modifications in the game, it was impossible to play without spending at least 200€. Sorry for the bad english guys, if you just want to try the game, go ahead, like i said, but if you are looking for a real mmo, to spend some time playing, just skip this. Have fun ;) 5/10",

I like digimon, and I was excited about the prospect of being able to obtain and use my favorite one's in this game. The subpar graphics and lackluster combat wasn't much of a deterrent in the face of my nostalgia. The rng mechanics however, made it impossible to enjoy. In the 8 hours I played, I never even left the first area. I grinded a digimon I liked to get a very low drop chance egg that I could hatch for use on my team. Then I grinded the necessary items to hatch the egg. Then, after numerous failures, the egg broke. After breaking several more eggs I realized that the chances of success are abysmally low. Eggs are basically duds for anyone without godlike rng or far too much time on their hands. This means everyone else has to pay money in the cash shop just to get anything other than the starting digimon. I really wanted to like this game, but when the game keeps setting you up to fail in one of its (imo) most important feature, it's just not worth it.",

It's kind of a bad game.  The UI is clunky and unintuitive. The quests range from “walk to the other side of the map, wait come back” to “grind X until enough McGuffins drop,” with little variance. There are a lot of important items that are either poorly explained or not explained at all, which becomes burdensome when combined with a needlessly complex, disconnected series of systems for upgrades. Your item space is limited, and while you will initially get a handful of expansions in the tutorial, the rest you must pay real money.  Speaking of microtransactions, unless you shell out, it’s going to be a very long and restricting grind for you. While there’s a deceptively wide variety of Digimon to raise, space is very limited – you have three slots for active Digimon (the fourth must be bought with cash), and only ONE SLOT in your Digimon archive. How can you expand your archive? You guessed it, cash shop.   To get a chosen Digimon without spending money, you must grind for the egg drop, grind for the specific “data” items to hatch it, and if you don’t have a backup item from the cash shop (or endgame – you guessed it – loot farming), all your work may go to waste anyway as the egg shatters in your hatching attempt. Theoretically, you might get lucky and get some of these items through events, but you’re still going to have a lot of slogging ahead of you. Oh, and you’ll be fighting bots for spawns every step of the way.  If you’ve got cash to burn… I still wouldn’t really advise this game. There are plenty of other free MMOs, and plenty of good games that you’ll only have to pay for once. ",

The general feeling is that it's a lousy game engine with lousy gameplay simply grabbing the Digimon theme sauce to try to save itself. Final verdict: DO NOT PLAY. There's also a Pay To Win system in their in-game shop.   PROS 1. Digimon That's the only saving grace.  CONS 1. Bad Tutorial  Hard to do. It's not smooth. You can literally run to the next location without knowing what to do. It is not intuitive at all.  2. Dull Gameplay Extremely bad. It's even worse than fetch quests and I don't know how to create a scenario more boring than fetch quests. There are quests that have so many unnecessary steps. E.g. DATS centre? Egg hatching?  3. World is boring Seriously, the creatures just spawn all over the place with no reason why they are there. It is horrible. Why do you want Kuromon Dragon Type Data? No idea? Just bash them over the head and they'll respawn. Why are Kuromon in the city in the first place?  4. Pay To Win Seriously, $6.90 for a powered up Digimon pet immediately. $0.10 for Digiclones.",

            "review_text": "The question is whether or not I recommend the game, not whether or not I would still play it. The answers are No and Yes, respectively.  I played this game back when it was still owned by Joymax, and I think even before I joined Steam. I played back before fancy new DATS center was introduced, if you want to guage how old of a user I was. For hours, I probably had 600+ hrs.  Why can't I recommend this game? Because you need this much to sucessfully play as a F2P:   1 Burst Mode Capable Digimon for carding (E.x. Renamon). Must be 5/5 for maximum speed; 4/5 might work out. Gaomon is a possible replacement.   2 Jogress Capable Digimon for Raiding (E.x. Omnimon/Omegamon). One must be 5/5.   Simple right? I mean, you start out with 3 extra digimon slots. How hard could it be?  Well, here are the materials you need:   ~50 eggs  per Digimon    ~2500 Data  per Digimon    1 Burst Mode item (Event Only)   27 Evoluters (Event Only)   Grinding time   Pay for this all in in game currency, and you get around 55 Terra, 250 Mega minimum. Assuming 15M for eggs, 5M for data, 15T for BM, and 1T for Evoluters. (I will edit the pricings soon enough. Since the rapid influx of player has distorted the market by a lot, I'll look into making 10M for eggs and 1M for data)  Now, 1T takes probably a week of nonstop grinding, possibly less. So, it'll take you  almost a year  to even hope to compete with other tamers!  So, Gameking, here's how to fix this:  Make events actually worthwhile to play on. I don't    actually I probably would    care how you do it. Just make it so grinding new digimon isn't so bad. Here's how I think about it:  More people grinding more digimon = more people getting bored of their digimon = more people buying Eggs = More people buying Digimon Archive Expansions = More people buying burst mode items.  Tl;dr Make the grinding experience easier through events so more people feel less forced to spend money, and therefore more likely to spend their money on other easier to purchase items.  Of course, by making grinding easier, we'll need to increase the security of the game against botting. But, let's take this one step at a time.",

PROS: - Great digimon models - Great attack animations - Solid sound - I even like (barely) the elevator music in this game which suits the digimon universe  CONS - Worst character 'customizaion' I've ever seen in entire MMORPG gaming world. - Cash Grabing shop model - Only rental items and insane boosters. Also there are just few things you can buy in cash shop in terms of character customization. - There are roads and there are sidewalks, you can walk on the roads but forget about sidewalks..  - Very bad and boring map design - slow movement - Grindfest galore (it's kinda expected from F2P games) - Boring quests - Even though I love cell shaded graphics, Digimon models are the only thing that looks solid. The rest is a potato. very bad 'feel' overall - The worst UI I've seen in a MMORPG game. Completely unintuitive and plain ugly. Been playing games for over 20 years and this was the first time I was lost as a naked man sailing on a crooked carrot and trying to figure out what am I supposed to click next. - UI has the worst colour palette I've ever seen in a game. Everything is in ugly neon or over-saturated colours. From Lime green to dark magenta. Yes, It's so disturbing you can't even focus on the main game. Feels like a cheap flash game UI. - Overall feeling is that game looks and feels like it's from 2002   overall score : bruised agumon/10  EDIT: Bottom line, I'm still playing it. Looks like I can chew down pretty much any Digimon game no matter how bad it is. If you're a Digimon fan, there is no reason why you shouldn't try it. Although most of the maps look like a potato, some are really decent with nice cartoonish textures. Fighting model is what's keeping me playing for me it's really good and impactfull. (gotta get my black metalgreymon :D ) I'm leaving a negative review score due to reason that this game needs urgent changes and I hope devs will do something about it. there is no reason why this game couldn't be good. All I want is a brand new UI and redesign of some maps. Also if there were some type of minigames between players that would be neat !",

I'm also really not into picking one-of-a-few generic models as an avatar.  The tutorial starts with the super basic WASD/ click movement, moves onto battles and then suddenly drops you in a tutorial world which is an agonising mix of 'follow this arrow and kill 5 digimon then follow the arrow back' and a badly translated text-wad that gives you no info whatsoever. For a game that must be making a fair chunk of money you'd think they'd put some effort into the translations, 50% of the sentences don't make much sense. Once the tutorials are over you're transported to the early-level zone, given a few more quests which literally repeat what the tutorial told you and then let loose with a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of other items which aren't explained at all. There's a lot going on in this MMO to begin with and a lot of the items I've gotton from grinding enemies being effectively useless as I don't have a clue how to use them.  I haven't got far enough into the game to really care about microtransactions, but even after 6 hours certain aspects of the game are incredibly boring unless I spend money on items. I get that the game's free and they have to make money somehow, but if you're planning on hatching a digimon you'd better be prepared to spend HOURS grinding up the resources. Again, I know it makes them more of an achievement once you do get them, but it's not even a guarantee that the 10 items needed to level up an egg ONE out of a minimum THREE times will work! Grinding should offer a reward, not a chance at getting a chance at a third of a reward.  Usually I can play an MMO for hundreds of hours before getting sick of it, but after a measley 6 in DMO.. I doubt I'll get above 20.  The running animations also don't loop very well.",
