            "review_text": "I wish I had ten spacebars.  This is a short, straightforward, free-to-play platformer where you play a cute little 'box' trying to run and jump through 40 levels that are often tiny but sometimes challenging, divided into four areas of ten levels each. Finish an area, and you get an item you'll need in order to complete the next. Item gains are retroactive, so you can return to most earlier areas with your newfound abilities despite there not being a need to do so. Run out of your stock of lives by hitting floor spikes or letting the eponymous time limit expire, and you'll be sent back to the main menu to do the whole area all over again.  The game is kind enough to give a flashing-light warning to epilepsy-sensitive players, which is important since most of the game's 'gimmick' is in its hyperactive backgrounds. These are meant to be distracting and to psyche you out as you quickly figure out how to move through a level. Levels also have aesthetic 'dressing' on them, so you have to try through experimentation to see what objects impact the gameplay and which are simply part of the art. The music is really, really good, and it's somewhat hard to complain about frustration when even repeating several levels in a row can take less than 15 seconds to get back to where you got stuck. The sections where you have to train yourself *not* to jump excessively prove the most memorable.  Most of the game isn't very difficult, save for a few levels in Area 3 (Area 4, despite its additional trick, is easier), and you don't have collectibles to bother with other than 1-Ups you can find in certain places. The last level contains a big surprise and is a ton of fun.  You could probably complete a good chunk of the game in the time it took me to type this review, but for $0 and a tiny download, there's no reason not to give it a try.",

The keys are simplistic but aren't as precise as say Super meat boy. In some levels I also felt that skill didn't really matter and you could just spam space bar and boom. The soundtrack is OK but it doesn't have much standouts. I did thouroughly enjoy the last level. For a 28 mb download I'd say this game is worth a shot to have some good fun. I did end up beating the game in about half an hour, but one of the achievements is to beat the game in five minutes, so it's a relatively short game. It's a fun, short, platformer, and I'd say it's worth a good hour of your time. I'd give it an average 5/10. Hopefully in the future they add more levels. I would gladly play more of this game. Enjoy. Also the trailer dropped for the second game and it looks like it has more variety and levels. And it's free, of course.",

Do not worry cause you will begin with 2 extra lifes and there are about 2 extra once you can pick up. This game has some great music, simplistic but good gameplay, no violance apart from dying on spikes, but it only goes to white and spits you out on the start again. This game will test your skills to some extence. In the game there are some achievement goal you can try to go after that will not count on steam. Speedrun, Ironman, finding a secret and beating the game. So if this sounds like something for you then try out this free game.  Have fun, enjoy and hurry :)",

I think this game is tagged as difficult but I did not feel that to be the case. There were some levels that I died a few times on, but there were so many levels that we giveaways. Because I had to do Area 4 many times to get past the ending level, it's freshest in my memory. In I think the 7th level, there's no use of the magnet item, and there's nothing to kill you or trick you or take much of your time. This is so close to the end of the game and yet it's a giveaway level, I would consider it a waste. The game would be just the same without that level except that I wouldn't be thinking everytime how much of a waste that level is. In general, the timer is extremely lenient, as I never once ran out of time or felt the pressure to rush through levels. In fact, most of the pressure to play quickly came from the fast falling physics, which were frustrating at times but looking back I think it was a good choice. In summary, making the levels longer or the timer shorter, and make every level count. I think that's the difference between a pretty good game and a really fun game. It definitely helps kill a few minutes though.",

Its main trick isn't the difficulty of the course or mastering its secrets; rather, it's visual deception. The presentation is a bit obnoxious. with a some pattern that flashes in and out in the background while you play that's easily distracting, the player being hard to see among many of the backgrounds due to a poor lack of coloring and distinction, and courses can often be laid out in a way that deceives you into looking difficult, rather than actually being difficult. Once you get past the presentation and how the courses are laid out, it's way easier than it seems, and it becomes less about trial and error and learning the game's tricks and more about fighting against the visual design to look good. There's even a level in the fourth course called 'Confused?' which I think says it all. The final final area of course four is at least the least obnoxious-looking. A nice touch is that the lives counter stays static on a certain point of the level. If that's intentional, it's admittedly pretty funny.  There are also in-game achievements, but with the way this game is set up, why even bother going for those? As far as the soundtrack goes, it's pretty typical pump-up music, but not really anything more than decent. And thankfully the game doesn't belabor itself with dragging it on too long; I was able to more or less see everything and get the big picture in 20 minutes.  There's a sequel in the works, which I hope is frustrating but for the right reasons this time, rather than the wrong ones. I don't expect any of these side-scrolling, difficult 2D platformers to be on the same level as other highly-praised examples of the genre, but if the game has to rely on tricking you to give the illusion of difficulty, it's not really difficult so much as it is a burden.",

A 16 years old school project for computer class will be about this level or more. Yes im writing all this in brackets because the main review should be simply a 'no'. Games like that ruin steam and downgrade its level. This game might be free but it is not worth your free time)",
