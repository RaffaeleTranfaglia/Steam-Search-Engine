It feels like a practice program. This original game feels like a game should. Praise and objectives are much more fun to recieve than the new version. If you want to learn guitar , but are more into video games I think this would work better for you than 2014.",

            "review_text": "Here's how the game mostly works. The game requires a special cable that allows you to plug your guitar into your computer. So just downloading the game won't allow you to play it unless you have that special interface cable. Once you plug in and tweak your options, the basic campaign will give you the simple 'Rocksmith' experience. When you first start, all of the songs are not yet 'leveled up,' so you only need to play just a few notes of the melody, and probably no chords at all. But as you play each song again and again, the game figures out which sections of the song you're getting good at, and increases the difficulty, add more of the melody's original notes. This goes on continually, for every song you play, making the game increasingly more challenging the more you play it. After you have played each song and 'leveled them up' to maximum, you'll basically be playing the song as it was recorded.  As a 'guitar instruction' method, I really think this has potential. The early part of the game is simple enough that really ANYONE could play it, and the more you play, the more the game challenges you as a guitar player. Each song as a few different arrangements, some focusing on lead, some on rhythm and chords. The game is a harsh judge, so make sure you hit EVERY note, not just the ones that are easy to play!  As some who already plays guitar, I found the game was most rewarding when I was selecting individual songs to play from the game's catalogue, without bothering with the campaign at all. I sort of knew how to play Outshined already, but learning how to REALLY play it without cheating was a treat. I pick a song I like, and practice all the parts of it individually until I can play them all, then I try to put them all together by playing the complete song on the maximum level. Sometimes I can pull it off, depends on the song.  So if you're already a guitar player, or you are really interested in learning to play, this game is definitely for you! Tons of new songs to play as downloadable content. But if you're a 'gamer' who's not really much of a musician, even if you really liked Guitar Hero, I'd say this game is probably not your cup of tea. It's more of a 'musician's thing' than a game.  The game also features support for basses, and an entire campaign just for bass players. FINALLY, some respect!",

The UI is clunky and slow at best and I honestly uninstalled it just now. I'd rather learn the old fashioned way from a book than ever deal with that UI again. If I hadn't bought this so long ago and forgotten it I would be applying for a refund. As it is, I had more enjoyment typing a review than playing the actual game. if you have patience for bad UI and overall design this might be a good solution for you, but I personally refuse to lower my standards on what I'm willing to deal with and therefor this goes into the 'games I bought and played once then never touched again' stack with the likes of divinity II and other garbage.  I should note that I spent VERY little time actually playing this game so the review maybe not so much on gameplay, but the time spent with the menu made me absolutely hate this game before even going into playing it.",

My few issues are: due to its awesomeness, it's damn near impossible to find the real tone cable in a real store - you have to order them via gamestop or newegg, and they are quite pricey; also, the price point is a bit high for the DLC and it's kind of tricky to find songs that you'll like; I wish the recommendation system was better implemented, and of course, there are all sorts forms you have to fill out to recommend a song.  Still, quite an amazing piece of software, if you own a guitar and don't want to spend a whole lot of money on lessons before you find out that you hate guitar, I would recommend this for you. 95 out of 100.",

The fact you are actually playing a song on your own guitar, while you just read the fluent stream of tabs and play along with the real song.. well that was my dream!  However, I do recommend to new players Rocksmith 2014! It has solved all the bad(ish) aspects of this Rocksmith and includes whole new features. If not for the songs, definitely buy rocksmith 2014 if you are in doubt, but ofc, if you like most songs of this one more, then buy this rocksmith first.

Plugging in everything was easy, the first song catchy and simple to pick up, and the song list is impressive.   I've improved drastically since starting to play this in conjunction with some how-to videos and a chord book. It's clearly based off the idea and popularity of Guitar Hero, but don't expect it to follow naturally if you are a Hero hero. More finger movement, callouses and goddammit stop scooping the string, you're scooping the string don't do that make for a interesting gaming challenge.   It's not perfect: the multiplayer occasionally refuses to pick up the second player (usually me, making my already abysmal scores plummet) and even single player drops quite a few notes if the cord is not aligned correctly. And with the Steam version, you do need to buy that cord seperately.   However, I could play this game for hours. Feeling like an actual musician when you can fret without looking at it rocks and the first time you master a chord in-song is the most exhilarating thing. I've seen 2014 played and there is a lot of improvement in the interface, pickup and subtlety of the game, but Rocksmith still holds its own. The songs are solid, the gameplay is intuitive and you get to be a rockstar to crowds of enthusiastic 2d cut-outs.

As a side-note, career mode is not the only feature RS1 offers over RS2014.  Thus, I'd recommend getting this game (maybe retail with the cable, likely cheaper than Steam overall, outside of sales) and then 'upgrading' to Rocksmith 2014 once you've played through a good amount of the career mode, at least that's how I did it and I feel like it was a good transition.
