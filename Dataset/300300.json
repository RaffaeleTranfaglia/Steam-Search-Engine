While the initial 60 levels are rather short and easy, there are thousands of user submitted levels, and that is what truly makes this a nice game, and seperates it from what would normally be a mobile title.  I would rate it 6/10 and suggest buying it on sale or in a bundle.",

The Bad: Plaqued by the achievements.  There are lots of bad puzzles in the community because of the grindy nature of some of the achievements (which require you to publish puzzles and get people to play them). To add insult to injury, achievements often don't register.  Game would benefit from more default puzzles, or creator-approved community puzzles.  For the price, recommended.",

As such, because of the poor interface and non-existent graphics settings (puzzle games don't need much, but none is much worse than some!) we're going thumbs down here. If you like puzzle games, buy this for iPad/Android. It's not a PC game and it's deceptive of the developers to market and publish such a bad port as a PC game.",
