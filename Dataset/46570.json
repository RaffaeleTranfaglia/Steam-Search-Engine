You'll have to Google it like me lol) but I'm really liking the new voiceovers and it retains much of the good humor. It's a fun turn based Isometric view RPG so anyone that are fans of that should give it a try.",

            "review_text": "Unfotunatelly really buggy combat system makes this game unplayable.   With few more words: good:  Game/story itself is great, still the same parody of rpg games and grotesque series itself, so lots of funny moments. Game is dubbed, although voiceactors are overacting, but its parody so i rate this as +. Sexist screenwriters tried even harder than in the first game, heroes are teasing and arguing all the time, so something like school bus full of teenagers, for me it worked just fine  but can imagine that bus drivers, educators or mothers of 3 or more children would hate this part of game. Sometimes voices are mixed or voices and subtitles are mixed, for example drake talking with voice of aterius ( dont think it is supposed to be this way, but its parody so +) First part of game there is no healer in your sqaud, so you will use potions a lot, thats tough and fun, cause they were useless in first game (and they will be useless in the middle part of this game again)  bad: Special abilities of heroes are gone (heroes have skill trees, they are small and not described good enough). Bad description of everything in the game, quests are confusing, no minimap or anything to help traveling. After 2-3 hours you will probably get lost without any clue what to do next, where to go, who to speak with ...  very bad: COMBAT - bugs, bugs, bugs: stuck in combat mode, stuck in mode you cant do anything (no wait, no defend, neither skip turn, only load works or save/load sometimes), respawnig killed monsters, npc/monsters that dont turn into enemies ( so they hit you and you cant hit it neither with sigle target spell nor area damage spell) defending stance have no affect, you take the same or more damage,  start of combat i was complaining even in first game and ofc now its same hell, they added bonus dmg from behind, thats fine, but AI cheats, your heroes face last ai after each hit, so therefore each ai hit is from behind (!) on the other hand ai never turn so you can hit from behind only once CAMERA - is evil, you cant zoom out, you can adjust it by middle mouse button, but you can select only from range (topdown - totally useless), camera autofocuses on heroes (randomly), never on heroe you are taking turn right at that moment, so most of the time during combat you just fight with camera, also it macrozoom automaticaly without reason throught textures to the first floor/ground when you are on higher platforms (which is for sure great, epileptic friendly experience) PATHFINDING - because of it you can start combat broke into 3 groups in three different corners of the map ..., you can also get stuck in narrow spaces (party members will block your way and again only save/load works) ESCORTING MISSIONS - all previous 3 together + dumb suicide AI  tip for escorting missions (if you really have to play it): finish all eligible quests to lvl up your heroes and buy all movement +2 jewelery from merchants (you will need it)",

Also, the main village is far too spread out, requiring a ridiculous amount of walking around in order to complete a simple quest. Very disappointing after the wonderful first game.",

I like the concept and could enjoy the game... if it would work for me.  Turns out, many people have problems with bugs - pity there is no demo to try before buy. For me the game is unplayable, even restart from the beginning does not help. And the game is not SO good to justify hours spent on workarounds.",
