A VERY enjoyable experienec in the vein of LYNE and other puzzlers that don't hurry you up with timers and other stuff. You take your time and try to solve the puzzles with the chance to perfect them, which is just not undoing any moves.  With varying complexity and a huge amount of puzzles, there is plenty here to keep you entertained for several hours or to save you from a boring day at work.  Recommended!",

            "review_text": "When I installed the game I thought about a short puzzle game, but after launching I was astonished how many puzzles this game has. You have 7 stages with 4 waves. Every wave consist of 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 puzzles. And there are as many per puzzle as the puzzle dimension imply.  The only downside of this game. The achievements unlock too soon. Although I have all achievements I only played wave 1-4 and 7.  I can totally recommend it, if you are into puzzles. It even can help you train your short-term memory.  ",

But there is also the actual puzzle solving aspect. The puzzles themselves have an abstract way to them, and they'll put your mind to work. You'll wrack your brain figuring out the proper way to solve a stage... but just when you're about to give up, you'll simply  see  it. Clear in your mind: the solution. You'll suddenly find yourself in the zone, and you'll be solving stages in a breeze, amid an unstoppable flow of clarity.   It's a feeling that is hard to describe in words otherwise, so I highly recommend you experience it yourself.",

The music is soothing to listen to, and the puzzles are addictive and really enjoyable. If there's anything wrong with it, it's that sometimes the menus seem to randomly overlap each other and I can't click anything, forcing me to shut down the game and restart it. But this is only a minor inconvenience, really.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time to come!",

            "review_text": "A throwback to the dedicated puzzlers of the 90's like Honeycomb Hotel, all wrapped in a beautiful modern package.  This is one of those games you need to play fullscreen in a quiet room to really get the full experience. The art is minimalistic but the brightly coloured ribbons accent the view more and more as you progress into the larger levels. The music is very calm and suits the game very well, and every action you take introduces some small melody or sound.  In terms of actual gameplay, the main mechanic is intuitive and something I don't personally remember being done before, so props to the devs for that. The ribbons are a really fresh take on grid-based puzzlers and make some some surprisingly deep puzzles. And since there's more than one way to solve most of the puzzles, your free to form your own style of play.  For the price, I highly recommend picking up this gem if you're into casual puzzle games, or if you just want to chill out.  Very relaxing game. Well done.",

The store page says, there are eight available, but the game let's you only use one, likely based on in which region it was bought or to which country your Steam account is set to. (There is an option for changing the language in the Strata preferences but is has no effect, it keeps using the language it has decided for you.) This is inacceptable!",

Please stop reading if you still want to enjoy the game!  Think what do you expect when you are about to draw the last stroke? The last but one stroke? And so on. Or, what if it's not the topmost stroke that matters, but the bottom one?  Hope I didn't make a boo-boo in my proof; I kept getting PERFECTs for tens of levels in my first tries, except for some mistakes in moving my mouse...",

It's the digital version of a little game grandmothers would propose as a break between patchworks (or a way to keep the children busy while they do chores ^_^), and I wouldn't be surprised if yours would know it.  The minimalistic music helps relaxing, and the background resembles a stitching canvas, giving strenght to the aforementioned impression.  Some people complains it's easy to solve any level once you find the key, but they've probably forgot what's to be a kid at heart and just enjoy a simple game :)",

You're the friend people go to when they need knots untangled or Rubix cubes solved; b. you like games like Lyne c. you like sophisticated color palettes d. you like simple but soothing music for your background in puzzle games or  e. any/all of the above  My only criticism is that sometimes it doesn't seem to register that I'm clicking on a ribbon box - takes several tries to activate it. A blemish on an otherwise well-crafted game; might be a Mac bug, or might be something in my system, though I've yet to have any similar problems in any other game, which is what leads me to believe it's the fault of Strata, not my  baby  laptop. That aside, well worth the money and quite enjoyable.",

The thing is, the color of the top strip matches the color of the square it covers, which is much easier said than done when you are juggling 6 different colors, and a 6 by 6 grid.  With a few hundred puzzles, and a little over 10 hours of enjoyment, this game is definitely worth the $4. Hell, I still have it installed and I play it from time to time. It's really great for helping with anxiety.",

The people who've reviewed it already claiming there's a 'simply system' are slightly overstating that - yes, you can walk backwards through each puzzle to solve it but most puzzles have a system and this one isn't really any more or less obscure than others...  I enjoy playing this in short bursts, you may do too - it's a one-note puzzle but it's well presented and - well - works!",
