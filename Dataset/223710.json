It's amazing how Team Psykskallar squeezed such a great-looking horror game from such an old engine.   - Hardly any cons, just encountered few bugs througout the game and the voice acting can get a little cheesy sometimes but it's still very well done afterall.   ♥♥♥♥ing 11/10",

A place with rusty slides and naked trees around it. First, you're there out of curiosity, trying to overcome your fear. But then the place draws you with its unique atmosphere and memories that it bears.  Simon's experience becomes your own depression sweetened by transcendental ambient soundtracks. It's so much like one of your nightmares that you dwell on after a long unsound sleep. If you are born with congenial depression or have a chronic existantial crisis, this will be a nice supplementation to your splendid sufferings.",

The team that made this game also made the Afraid of Monsters mod for Half-Life, which some such as myself feel this was an improvement over it. The atmosphere in itself is just dark, metallic, tense, and irks danger more often than not. The way the world is built around this is pretty damn good too, it does it right.  Unlike Afraid of Monsters where ammunition worked in the same way as Half-Life, this game does it tradionally, with there being a magazine counter rather than total rounds in reserve; any time you reload you dump all the rounds in the last mag, no ifs ands or butts about it, it's gone.",

You play as Simon, a disturbed man that gets hit by a car and wakes up in an alley. As you wander aimlessly through the dark Scandinavian night, you get attacked by vairous monsters and demons that represent your life before and after the accident. Throuout the game, you encounter many disturbing hallucinations, that progressively get more disturbing and dangerous as the game progresses. This game is a psychological horror, and only the bravest can witstand the entire game to its brutal conclusion. The game has multiple endings, each one having a slightly different scenario, thirty unlockables, several custom campaigns, and a follow up co-op campaign, along with a custom co-op campaign. This game is dark, disturbing, and atmospheric.And it explains some of the things that people might experience after suffering from traumatic experiances. Sadly, the developers aren't making any more updates for it.",

After the first part with the camera i was scared beyond reason, i couldnt force myself to play until a checkpoint or however this game saves, so i just quit the game, and got somewhat depressed and couldnt sleep at all that night... had to push through the night watching cartoon network, not being able to shut my eyes for more than 10 mins at a time.

First of all on intial launch of the game through steam your presented with this very small window with a few options to click on. From this small screen you have to then click another button that says 'Launch' to actually start the game. While this isnt a big deal its kind of an annoying setup.  Second the game crashes allot and doesn't save settings. I had my game crash 3-4 times just trying to join the server my boyfriend had set up for us to test out this game. As far as the settings issue goes I nearly got my ears blasted out from the volume of this game. So naturally I yank off my headset and go to look for the volume settings. Turned the volume way down and clicked apply assuming that it had worked. Closed out of the options menu and went to look for the join server button again. Of course my game crashes again so I re-launched it and once again almost got my ears blasted out because of the 2 part launch setup. Once I actually got into the game I realized it hadn't saved my volume settings. I went to change them again and after exiting the settings menu now the main menu structure is all screwed up.  This brings me to my third issue with this game the menu structure. When the game is first launched the main menu looks like any other typical menu you'd see in a co-op style game. However once you actually click on anything the menu changes and it is very difficult to get back to the original menu as there seems to be no obvious 'back' or 'previous' button anywhere on screen. That for me was strike number three and after having all these issues when the game crashed for a fourth time I gave up and uninstalled the game.  If you really wanna play a game like this thats free and based off of half-life try sven co-op. Its not as creepy but at least its freaking playable.",

The game mirrors the human endeavor to arise from the mundane and materialistic plane unto the divine and immortal sphere of the enlightened ones through multiple reincarnations. I came to understand the role of the modern emasculated man living in the Kali Yuga, to live as an ascetic warrior resisting the facade of the modern liberal monoculture. Thats why I showed Alexander Dugin this game and he said it affected him profoundly. Whoever made this game should get a noble piece prize and I will personally blow him/her.",

Games like Silent Hill and Amnesia immediately spring to mind.  Cry of Fear is too good for that old way. They took the novel approach of building tension by making it phycologicly draining to even play the game. It took 50 minutes of menu clicking and server setting up to even start to think about launching the actual game. All the while your brain is churning and building that tension 'will this game be worth the pain?' 'What horrors could this agonizing process result in?'

Pros  -Free to play means that there is micro transactions to it this is a absoluelty   free game   -For a Free game the atmosphere is honestly amazing it spooks me, not like jump scare once and a while but a actually feeling of horror around every bend going into every door, the music is fantastic and so are the ambient horror noises that happen through the game  -From what ive seen in what ive played the enemy design is so well done, very silent hill style but a bit more...disturbing  -Being only two hours in it seems to have a pretty nice story line but i havent seen the full scope of the things to come and i may update it once i complete it    Cons   -My biggest problem is the controls, there is some obsticles that once you get to it you have to play with the control and jump just to get through, but i can see that easily being fixed no problem, they may have just over done it with the box collider size  -This is just a personal thing, i would have loved to have seen a limited ammount of saves thing just like RE had back in the day, I really loved that concept then and would have worked well in my opinion in this game to  -Besides these two minor things this game is amazing   Other thoughts  in this game im always at the edge of my seat with my heart pumping, Having been a huge fan of every RE game for the past almost 2 decades and silent hill, NONE of the there newer stuff has made me feel the way this game makes me feel, besides that i cant think of the last game that actually did make me feel me being scared all the way while playing it, these dev team clearly hit the nail on the head with a sledge hammer on this game and the fact its free its honestly unbelievable.

Cry of Fear is a horror indie game which has a inmersive as impressing atmosphere which will make you feel like you're Simon (The protagonist), a 19 year old who writes things that are happening to him in a book.  It's a must-play really, especially if your a horror games fan like me.  The game itself has decisitions which you can take (like for example killing a determinate boss or not) that will affect the story's ending and events.  The only real problem with this game is that you will need to port forward or either use Logmein Hamachi to create a multiplayer server, due to the game does not come integrated with a system to host one like Left 4 Dead 2's one.  My final veredict is a 9.5/10 as it's pros and cons will be specified below.  Pros :  -Has a awesome multiplayer campaign taking the role of 1-4 cops who they attempt to find Simon and save him from all these monsters he created.  -Loads of monsters to battle, as some challenging bosses too.  -Amazing story and stages.  -Has unlockables that are hard to unlock but are worth it.  -Has 5 endings, all creatively created. (7 if we count both the unlockable character's story mode and the multiplayer one)  -Somewhat curious character.  -You have a unlockable that will let you play in ANOTHER different campaign as a character that helps Simon out in the original story (Don't want to spoil it entirely.)  Cons :  -Multiplayer requires port forwarding or LogMeIn Hamachi to play with friends and since the master server list is broke, you will need to open up the console and type in it 'connect' (without quotes) and the IP of the server to join it (E.g : connect 190.245.78.75:27015)",

            "review_text": "You play as a depressed, self-harming boy named Simon, who goes through a variety of locations where both his physical stamina and mental stability are put to the test as he tries to return home. As you progress through the game, you begin to realize how the sheer insanity of the enemies actually reflect on Simon's very thoughts and emotions.  You have to go through this game assuming that something is going to pop out at you from where you are trying to go, or break down the door that you're directly in front of. This means that to progress, you will either need quick reflexes from the start, or you will have to employ trial and error very frequently.  There are a few issues in this game, one being that if you open a note that you stored, or even sometimes when you are reading the map in the park, the game will get stuck on it, and you will be forced to reload the most recent game save to escape the screen. Additionally, the collision experienced here is almost game-breaking; there were several instances where it took 20+ minutes in one location because of awkward placement of objects and/or enemies. The absolute darkness and apparently broken gamma/brightness adjustment controls also had me navigating through moving along walls for most of the game, especially underwater.  I recommend playing this game on 'Easy' difficulty on your first playthrough if you don't want to get incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, as I played it on 'Normal' and I'm genuinely surprised that I beat this game. There are little provisions for ammo and health, but when there are, they will either easily be overlooked because of their placement in seemingly insignificant locations, or they will be placed in plain sight, but only because you are about to REALLY need them.  The horror of the game itself was initially frightening, but only because it was unfamiliar. The jump-scares of the game quickly changed from shocking to annoying, as the same scares repeated themselves over and over and over again. The appearance of the enemies along with the general atmosphere of the game was more creepy than it was scary, but it did have a nice effect on the tensions in the game.  Why do I recommend this game?: Only because the storyline and the existence of the enemies have a very intriguing and surprising correlation, which you slowly find out as you progress through the game. Cry of Fear is full of jump-scares, but it is also full of cheap, unfair, and broken mechanics that make higher difficulties mind-numbingly frustrating.

Anyway, just had to get that off my chest, now for the pros and cons!   pros  -Interesting storyline that slowly reveals itself  -Lots of unlockables, challenges, custom campains,and multiple endings for replayibilty  -Game doesn't make you feel like its a mod, more feels like it's its own game  -Very realistic gunplay, like reloading too soon will waste bullets  -A good variety of interesting, and/or scary monsters whith different ones getting intruduced as the game progress, keeping you on your feet.  -Truly good jumpscares/scares, the game has a tendency to get you nice and comfortable and then BAM in your face  cons  -Kinda wierd learning curve, like some tutorials seem inconplete  -Ammo saving melee can be very hard to do, and takes awhile to figure out the proper technique  -Co-op campain seems a bit buggy, like randomly getting disconnected or being able to keep stun-locking enimies  -Dated graphics, although kinda phenominal for using the old half life engie and still looking decent, pales in comparison to the graphics of other horror games   misc  -very hardcore kinda gameplay, this can be a bad thing for some people and a good thing for other people, so I didn't want to put this in pros or cons   So if you like horror games, give this a try, afterall it is free. Just make sure to give the game a fair chance, once you understand how the mechanics work you'll love it.",

This game follows a 19 year old boy named Simon Hanriksson that gets hit by a car in the beginning of the game, then wakes up to find himself in the middle of an alleyway which you must traverse through to get to the next area, like every other horror game. It then turns into a pshycological, puzzle-solving, action adventure, horror game.   The game includes lots of jumpscares and disturbing enemies that tend to twitch a very lot, so do not play this game if you have heart problems. Cry of Fear HAS made me jump and pause the game due to the scare factor. It has a very dark atmosphere that can make you feel clostrophobic, trapped, and sometimes helpless.   The enemies are very fast, deadly, and creepy as well. Luckily, you are able to defend yourself with different type of weapons, like handguns, shotguns, rifles, and melee weapons.  The game's online feature is very neat as well, and doesn't follow the same role as Simon did. Instead, you and your friends are given the roll of police officers that are looking for Simon to help him, but eventually embark onto his nightmares. Sometimes, Simons evil-self shows randomly at some point and tries to dispose of you and your pals with a shotgun. Make sure you have some ammo with you at the time, or at least a plan, because there have been times when me and my friends were caught off guard and eventually were all killed.

Now, may I present you with my main problem with this game? SPOILER ALERT: IF YOU DO NOT WANT DISSAPOINTMENT, DO NOT READ PAST THIS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                            This game turns into a 'jump here and you might not die we promise' type of game. Seriously. Some of the parts leading up to the ending are absolute ♥♥♥♥. Some have you jumping across corridors that are bending constantly in and out of ♥♥♥♥ing reality itself and occasionally there's two areas you can jump in and one will kill you, the other will not. The catch is you the player don't know which is the good one to jump in. As much as I liked this game, I can't reccomend it. It seemed promising with all this story line and the building around this doctor charecter, but after you kill him the game is just 'get home and play a parkour game on lsd' This is one of the cardinal sins in gaming. Allow me to explain; A 'bait and switch' as most of us call it, is the act of making a game or product seem very nice with promising storylines or charecters, or maps. Then, the developers proceed to pull said proverbial 'switch' and turn the game into the dissapointment it really is. This game could've been great, guys. COULD have.",

This game is packed with cliche scares, awful looking animations, boring atmosphere, enemies are clipping through the walls and it also has very clunky controls. The only good thing about Cry of Fear is that it's free to play. So you either you like it and continue playing or you don't, in which case you delete it like I did.

In terms of gameplay, the combat is typical Half-Life 1 style, which I don't have a problem with. What I DO have a problem with is the absolutely pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. Every single enemy has a weakness: CIRCLE-STRAFING. When I can easily avoid your enemy attacks by dancing around them like an idiot, it kind of ruins the whole 'horror' atmosphere. There's also an insane amount of backtracking you have to do. Who the hell enjoys backtracking? Didn't Rumpel learn from Daikatana? The puzzles are mind-numbingly simple enough I think the devs ripped them off from bargain bin mystery games. Oh right, I mentioned the AI's weakness was circle-strafing earlier. For a lot of enemies, it seems a lack of motivation is also one of their weaknesses: at some points of the game, the zombies let me mindlessly wail at them with my knife while they just stood there gurgling.  Graphics. EARLY PSone era graphics. I don't care about graphics, but I don't see how people praise this mods' graphics. Are we looking at the same game here? There's nothing noteworthy-looking about the game AT ALL.  Lastly, the story is something akin to that of a devianTARTlet's attempt at creepypasta. I say it's akin to deviantart because the main character is a one-dimensional edgy self-insert of Rumpel, because he's a self-obsessed egotistical nutbar. Generic enemies that look like Rumpel stole directly from games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil, a generic mad DOKTOR villian, pseudo-philosophical and emo nonsense make the 'story' (if you could even call it that) easily one of the worst plots in gaming history and make Deadly Premonition look like Edgar Allan Poe.  All in all, Cry of Fear is one of the worst Half-Life mods ever (despite generic fanboys overhyping it), and Rumpel is one of the worst modders in the community.",

            "review_text": "CoF is a horror shooter where you play as a young man who after having an accident on your way home you are awaken to a deserted town filled with horrific monsters and unanswered questions. While trying to survive this monster infastation you are also trying to figure out what has actually happened and if anything of this is real.  The game succeeds in the balance between psychological horror and jumpscares. There are several of them but at the right moment. The level design is very diverse with creepy atmosphere.Seriously, for a game thats so old (Half Life) the creators deserve such credit for making this game look so good. From abandoned asylums to dark corridors (I will never forget the segment with the flares), haunted forests and many more, there are clearly references to other horror games in some of them. The monsters are very well thought and the boss fights are very creative. The gameplay is very chalenging requiring you to do resource management and making you feel more vulnerable as the game progresses.  However, there were some moments of frustration while playing the game. The biggest flaw in my opinion is the amount of backtracking you have to do, fortunately it was just in a couple of levels. I also think that the game was a bit too difficult. There is a lack of ammo in some crititical points and a couple of impossible puzzles. However, you learn to appreciate the game's difficulty in the long run.   Overall I think that despite its flaws CoF is a solid horror experience and given the fact that it’s free I would recommend it to anyone who likes to be scared once in a while.   ",

I've finaly started to play this mod, and I've gotta say that on every single way I look, this game got 10/10 from me, except that the team just needs to put some effort in optimizing some areas on the game, but its not really matter, we can live with that. There are a lot of times where you'll be scared the hell out of you, when you're least expecting it. You'll be amazed by the story, by the atmosphere, and the most importantly one - by the gameplay ! This game got the quality that you would expect in a paid game! I highly recommend this to be played at night in darkened atmosphere and with headset for the best horror experience. This game is a huge success, unlike the other F2P indie games released on Steam or other platforms. Well done Team Psykskallar, I hope you'll bring us in future more masterpieces like this one.",

The combat in this game is very realistic, if you reload with bullets in your clip left you lose those bullets. The weapons are very satisfying although they aren't very strong, the sounds and animations somehow brought my morale up. The graphics are beautiful for a GoldSrc game! It is incredibly impressive and the scares did a good job although jumpscares do get annoying. However the atmosphere really sets the mood of the game. Soundtrack is also really good for horror. The flaws are that the inventory can get tedious and there are some jumping segments (let's just say this game wasn't really a platformer)  Overall I recommend you at least finish it once as it is quite a good piece of work.",

I will admit that yes, there are some tricky times during the game including backtracking and puzzles but it was enjoyable. A great Horror game is how i would describe CoF.

Well what do you know? go back the same way, search for the item and come back the entire path just to open a mere gate --&gt; sound sometimes completely outshines what is going on screen or vice versa, i.e the music did not change at all as i was fighting 3 zombie children with knifes on noth theri hands, and when i was just strolling around the streets the music changed to erie and perfect. very odd.   Judgement: - All in all it is a good horror game, the gameplay value is great albeit taking a hit on the graphical fidelity, and some minor design flaws. To top it all off its free!! so most of the cons can be overlooked as this game provides a great horror experience.",

The going back and forth is a bit annoying , and dear LORD the freaking platform of the game D= no this game is horror now Mario. I played this before I had my gaming laptop (best decision I ever made ) and it will play on most laptops but may lag a bit and the framerate will mean more harder accuracy   Story is great, Simon is a kool guy he's no a big hunky fighter he's quite vulnerable and you start to like him more later on. The story is a good one , I didn't find it predicable and clues to whats going on are not given too early.  Graphics are fine don't expect much here , I played it on my other laptop on lowest setting so I can't say I know what the highest textures are like.  Silent Hill fans will enjoy , has some elements of the classic games of silent hilll , symbols and combat style, a few more surprises. Why aren't the classic silent hill games on steam btw?  This game won't burn out the element of surprise with a $hit load of jumpscares, it does rely on the more creepy elements that us hardcore horror fans want. If you've become immune to most horror games then I can't say this will scare you but if you are scared playing outlast or a five nights of Freddie's games you'll be scared easily but you may even be scared of Herdy Gurdy too xD If you roll your eyes at jumpscares but still shutter from Pyramid head's foot steps you may also be spoked at bits of this game. It is just a mod game but it does try more than most to get under your skin rather than just go BOO.  (= Still have to play doctor mode , doctor mode may not work on low spec laptops, with my new gamer laptop I'll hve to come back and give it a go! ",

I started playing Cry of Fear knowing this, but quickly realized my depth of knowledge on fear was certaintly skewed a bit. It's a game that surprises you, forces you to stay calm and collected in moments where you're low on ammunition and/or fighting very menacing/pants-wettingly frightening enemies.  While Amnesia took survival horror and turned it into a franchise of special, more intuitive games, Cry of Fear acts as a more modest game, using the simple Source engine from Valve and turning it into the building blocks of an in-depth FPS experience. The development of the game is so advanced from its state as a Source mod that you can't really tell that the same engine was used for Half-Life 1.  The story, both multiplayer and single-player, is both extremely well made and naturally the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in a game past the story of Outlast, another original survival game that is more based on stealth and is without weapons. Sadly, neither is found in Cry of Fear, where ammunition is a necesity and every enemy is one that you are REQUIRED to slay to pass through.  In review, this game is amazing, and anyone with a heart-problem should steer clear of it AT ALL COSTS.",

            "review_text": "ell boys i was dying for this post and it’s discussion here in  PP.com  i don’t know why it didn’t take so long maybe the good Phillip was out of combat for some days.  But well back to the point, my review of this work will stay in a solid Personal Favourite, why? well is hard to find just ONE reason because this mod is actually awsome and great, but in my opinion one of the most solid reasons is the one stick to the powerful emotional feeling any person has when play this mod. And i mean as i remember from the beggining of the mod you almost inmediately start to have a kind of “conection” with Simon the main character in the mod, from there on you will be deeper and deeper in the great story and some of the “Desiscions” you will find in the course of the maps will be crussial for the ending plot, which also adds an important replayabilty value to it.  I have 2 favourites sections in this mod, the first is when you met “Sussy” in the apartens rooftops in front of “Wespets Gardens”, there happens probably one of the most powerful and bests cutscenes done for any HL mod, i mean you have to see it for yourself or remember that cut scene in order to know what i mean, that part is crazy oozes quality, and the artistic conection is great well done, when you talk with “Sussy” and then look at the stars in that dark threating sky, there’s like a calm in the middle of the nightmere Simon is living, then well that happen and you have to be very focused in what ur doing next, because an important desiscion to tke will happen after the sad tragedy….  The second part that i liked the most is just related to the mapping, I LOVED and i mean i really loved the whole mapping part when you have to make your way through the Subways stations, i mean i loved that part because maybe i love subway sistems in real life, and i think that’s a perfect real location for many hl maps and mods, i’d love to see some mapping competition related just to the Subway stations thematic, like a “subway-fight ville”. The whole maps in there are great and perfectly done, and well at the end of that section u actually have to get on board to a Subway train and await for ur destiny.  Then i have to get to the point of any HORROR mod, yeh and taht’s it i’ll talk about the point of every halloween’s eve, THE HORROR.  The horrorific parts in this mod, almost never ends, i mean it, i just didn’t dear to play this mod in the 10 hours it took me to end it, with 100% of my room lights off and with headphones, no, no, no, i even played it at night just with the TV turned on and only speakers sound, call me a ♥♥♥♥♥ but i just won’t probably dear to play this all dark and in my lonley room, the freakin monsters are just the best available in any horror mod, the sounds are just terrificly great with almost comparable to a pure professional retail game, the scary parts never let you rest, if u are in a dark hallway or a dark room i better be ready for a well scare any time, oh, and if u hear a chainsaw along some crazy ♥♥♥♥ yelling, i tell u don’t waste your prescious time looking BACK, JUST RUN FORREST RUN!!!!!!.  The gameplay is also important in this mod, at the begining was a kind of desesperate and frustrating experence to me, especialy because of the saves system and not quick saves at all, so be advised for that, then, after u found the first saving point ( usable tape-recorders) the game really starts like after the first 7 minutes of it, and there’s also where u can manage the weaponery and equipment system, which is also kind of difficult because u have to acces to it and manage at ur own risk the necessary pickable objects to solve more than 3 puzzles and manage ur melee and fire wapons also. About the wapons i loved them, but i wish more ammo would be available, but well aslo remember u are fighting against psycopathical delussion monsters in the head of a 18 YO guy so u won’t need a tank to beat an army presicely, i’d love a weapon with endless ammo as in AoMDC as a gift at the end of the mod, i don’t know as a gift for completing the 3 official endings or so.  Well i think i’ve typed all my toughts about this great mod, maybe and is obvious you may find some bugs in this mod, and taht could be annoying, but this project wouldn’t be bugs free so be advised about that, i experienced some mod crashing freezze in some mapping transsitions, but nothing deadly to stop me continuing playing till the end, i solve them restarting the mod and taking good care of my gameplay saves. I hope the bugs some day will be solved with further update verssions.  I just can say as a gamer that the Gold Source engine is used and well taken to the limit in here, the effects and textures are great, also the inovative creation in this mod is amazing, and sure is really well done in the technical part.  Finally just go on and play it, this one to me took me more than 10 hrs in gameplay so be advised that if it’s not as long as the G-String mod you will be very bussy in every single map of this mod soving puzzles and killing freaks, so go on, takle ur time be brave if u dare, and play it!!.",

All of those gave me scares and thrills but I garentee you that all of those are mere childs play compared to this masterpiece. Cry of Fear is probably one of my favorite games of all time (and it is way too different and independent to be considered a mod anymore). Its probably because it has everything that I think should be in a game of its type and does it amazingly. You play as Simon, a depressed Swedish boy as he makes his way through a night in Stockholm. The city however has twisted into a hellish nightmare in which disturbing creatures lurk in the darkness waiting to kill you at any moment. The game's beauty lies in how well its made. Even though you are given powerful weapons you still feel helpless. All of the enemies are menacing, but most of them are easy to defeat. The scares and disturbing images will haunt you long after you've shut down you're computer. Another thing this game does amazingly is the story. This one takes the cake for my favorite horror game because it combines all of the great things I talked about above with a mature and emotionally charged storyline that will have you questioning you're own views on life. With multiple endings and rewarding unlockables, you will play this game numerous times. Load it up, turn off the lights, put on your headphones, and Team Psykaller will tell you a tale of depression, love, despair, fear, and a boy just trying to find his way home.   5 out of 5",

Monsters: While I ragequited on Sawer after I learnt a way to fight him it was soooo easy. So yes this game does require thinking but a game without thinking a game without brains. The monsters in general are not to overpowered but makes you want to throw your laptop out of the window. But after the endless hours of trying to figure something out and than figuring it out makes you feel soo acomplished! Jumpscares and Sounds: Excellent and excellent. The jumpscares make you pee your pants. I watched my brother play this. The soundeffects are soo important in horror games so I find that a game with good sound (and graphics) are usually better than games with no sound effects at all! Overall I give this game a 9/10.

The game PETRIFIED me! and nothing seemed bad at all about the game (Except for the fact if you reload a non-empty clip you lose the ammo you had,and the old 1998 graphics,and the bugs...) The scare factor for me would be 10/10 (I covered my eyes throughout the dark camera flashing place) This game is abnormally strange and mysterious and having to travel the with Simon's slowly growing insanity is AWESOME! most Horror games i played would have a third person perspective (Silent hill,Dead Space,Resident Evil,) but Valve broke the fourth wall by adding the FPS which helped bring on the scares.And the story is both trilling and great having to walk though the streets to search for answers while having to survive Hellish abomnations,Including the Co-op story with Book Simon (Looking at pictures of him made me almost shut my laptop and run away! honestly) This game deserves this review and is a good Survival Horror game so play this now FREE game! (WARNING:This game is afterall both Rated: M and fake but to me its Rated: A and has lots of Language and violent and SCARY images so the wimpy need not apply but people like me YOLO! and don't crap yourself during this game and don't go insane like I almost did :) - DiamondDawg9",

Why? becaus he reminds me of myself! i always felt alone like him. i was refused by the girl i love just like him! whenever i play the game i feel like the simon is me. enough about myself lol im sure u guys want to learn about the game. 'HOW ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY?' so the game's atmosphere is really cool for an horror game, depressive and scary musics horrofic monsters who wants to slice u to bits and all that stuff and much more. As main character, u play as simon who had hit by a car and lost his legs. and from what i've understood u play in his mind in his thoughts in the game. This is a psychological game more than just a pure horror. its different and unique.and also this game has five different endings. never saw so much endings on any game and for the last thing you can play coop with ur friends and enjoy this psychopathic atmosphere.",

During the course of the story, you'll be confronted with several choices that will affect the ending.

It is a one of a kind experience...Granted I am only 3 hrs into it(about half way), I will say this game is Scary as Hell, If you truly allow yourself to become absorbed into it's world....Let's just say that playing it in the dark with Headphones on is a must...(be warned, if playing on a laptop in bed next to your wife late at night, your likely to get a pillow in the face after swearing from some of the scares!)  The pros -good, standard control setup -Great soundtrack -The overall Ambiance is spot-on -Interesting story(so far) -Scary as Hell  The Cons -outdated graphics (I would truly love to see a major publishing company pick this up and give it a major graphical overhaul) which at some points, this makes some of the 'Monsters' look kinda goofy looking -The voice actor's english is a little rough in parts -some of the puzzles can be a little frustrating -some of the jumps (um, why are we jumping?) can be frustrating, due to the level design (here is a hint-REMEMBER you can crouch, so try combining the crouch with the jump....Honestly, before I tried this, I got hung up in the opening act for 15mins!) -load time when going into a new section... -Scary as Hell -Getting a pillow in my face from my wife   My final Thought-Even after all of these minor to medium detractors, Cry of Fear is Honestly a superb game that truly should not be missed, if you enjoy a physcological thriller. Best of all it is FREE (which makes all the cons bareable....well all of them, except the pillow)  Enjoy!   Update 1/23/15-After another 6 hous into the game...I chose NOT to finish Cry of Fear...My feelings towards this game have drasticly changed....up until chapter 4, this game is pretty straight forward, not that complex, decent puzzles, superb ambiance over all a pretty good game as my original review stated...Then Chapter 4 came....  The problems with chapter 4....  #1-So far up to this point the game is pretty straight forward, it is in chapter 4(which honsetly is the longest chapter, about 10x as long as previous chapters) where you will spend a great deal of time running back and forth, and all the way around, and then back again, oh and then back agin to this other part for this item that you had to leave over there to go on, but now you need it, so back again we go, but we are somewhere new, so how do we get back again? if this doesn't sound so utterly confusing, let me tell you the best part....There is NO MAP/HUD...You have to relie on the exteremly vague maps that you find in random places...There is NOTHING saying 'hey go this way to get here' Your best bet is to take a picture of the computer screen when you have the map up with your phone(your real life phone) so you can reference back to it, to help from getting completely lost...and if that was not frustrating enough.........  #2-The Jumps....This is by far the most absolutely frustrating part of Cry of Fear...Some of the Jumps, in Chapter 4 are downright cruel...Like I said earlier, why the **** are we jumping? When did this become Tomb Raider?..............Honestly if the jumps where taken out it would in NO WAY detract from the overall enjoyment of the game....Having platform jumping in this game, is honestly just an attempt to frustrate the player, which truly is NOT needed......  My updated Final thoughts on Cry of Fear--Cry of fear started out as a great game, great ambiance, intriguing story,&amp; Scary as Hell......Then in the middle of the game, it Totally Tanks...&amp; you are left with one of 2 options, to continue on, for the umpteenth hundred time after dying(usually from failing to land the jump) or to give up.....After this game pushed me to the edge continuiously I had enough...&amp; decided to watch the walkthrough of Cry of Fear on Youtube...Let's just say after watching ALL 7 endings, this game is throughly messed up.....I will say this, It wasn't what I was expecting....  In closing--I am changing my recommendation on this game to 'NO'....mainly due to Chapter 4 being a mess...if you survive chapter 4, it truly doesn't get much better...It continues on the downward spiral of frustration and repeated back and forth trogging....Ultimately I recommend just finding the walkthrough on Youtube(without commentary for the best experience) if you want to see the story &amp; what's going on.....

            "review_text": "While I was originally put off because of it's origins as a GldSrc horror mod (had some crappy experiences in the past), I've grown to appreciate this little game. The atmosphere is very heavy, even for a horror game. The voice acting is decent, but nothing astounding in my book. Be warned though, the game kicks your ♥♥♥. The only way to heal yourself is through morphine syringes and those are few and far between. This, combined with a lack of console command cheats and saving only taking place at designated casette recorders (in the highest difficulty you have to also spend a casette to save) will lead to a lot of time being spent covering lost ground after respawning. It may take a cheap blow with jumpscaring enemies here and there, but excels in brewing dread. I found myself hardly tapping my keyboard, constantly trying to peek around corners so a monster couldn't get the jump on me. It borrowed a Doom 3 mechanic in which you must equip a light source in one hand to use it, often making players choose between sight and defense. Dual wielding exists, but one handed weapons have slower and less accurate attacks when used in conjunction of other one handed items. One big gripe I have with the game, though, is the prevalence of bugs in the standalone port. Many, many people complain that the co-op is unplayable and those with 64 bit computers will likely have to download a third-party patch to ensure stability, lest you crash before even getting to the first save point. As long as your system meets the requirements, download the single stability patch, and play the single player game, you can still get hours of play time with little issue.  Bravo, Psykskaller, bravo.",

This just proves that 'Because its survival horror' is not a good excuse for bad controls.  My only complaint is that, the over arching story is kind of weak. You won't get the brilliance of Silent Hill 2 in this. You will get the brillance in the self contained moment of each note you find - Story wise. I would actually give this a 5/5 if it had a more thought provoking story to it. The enemies are good and creepy, but a lot of them are just dudes. Some have no signifigance to the universe. But, when they try to make connections to the world and the monsters, it works quite well.  Its, just, again, the over arching reason behind everything is just sort of...Weak.  ",

At first I thought it was some scary game that will have cheap jumpscares and things that pop out everyonce in a while. However, that wasn't necessarily the case, there are jumpscares of course but then there are the easily seen scares from up ahead before you end up seeing you gotta run. Some things you can kill, some...certain...things you can't kill. I remember going through this and I went as careful and as interested I can get. Though some points can get you confused and you don't know what to do next such as crouch jumping into certain areas. I'll give that a good point to anyone new to play is the crouch jump into some places you think you can do.  I will say the psychosis parts are the one that make me question and wonder what's going on before you start to revolve the story around and find out what's really going on. My most memorable part is going through a dark forest and Chainsaw Freak chases you around screaming like crazy. Did I ever mention the atomsphere is really good? Super dark areas and a point where you're stripped of everything and only must defend yourself with a dimpy branch, while taking out fast breathing enemies, freaks that chase you relentlessly and running into more psychosis things.   I recommend Cry of Fear for those that like a good scare.",

Do you want a game with with a AWESOME yet confusing storyline having to search on youtube to break it down but when you finally understand it, it makes you want to play again? Do you want a game with multiple endings? Do you want a game that will cause you heart attacks? Do you want a game that gives you freedom to explore the city and gather supplies? (survival horror) IF SO go get a bottle of bleach just incase IT TAKES U 6 ***** HOURS TO GET OUT OF THE *****APARTMENTS. Either the way the game is crazy fun even in 2016.  ",

This is a mod done right, its always scary, the story is interesting, bosses are (sometimes) intense, characters are likeable and interesting, and the combat is basically the Half-Life combat but with duel wielding, how can you go wrong.  In short unless you're a huge wuss, you have to play this amazing adition to the Horror genre.",

Now when you add this (and more positive words) all up, that's what Cry of Fear is. This is not just a horror FPS game, this is a journey into the life of Simon, the protoganist, which is so intense you will remember playing this game even if it's 10 years ago. All you need is to be prepared to be taken away....   Trust me you will not be disappointed!",
