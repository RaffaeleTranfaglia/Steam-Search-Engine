            "review_text": "Zombies on a Plane    Controls: 78/100 Mouse+Keyboard    I don't think I need to explain the controls unless you don't own this game then the basics for the player to move around is WASD + Mouse to point and shoot.    Audio: 70/100    When it comes to sound the game leads to fun but it would be better to add more music or selection to pick out from for example something to get users laughing like Romance songs while zombie dance their way to kill you, I think I'm trying to point out they act differently based on the music on the plane?    Graphics: 60/100    The Graphics aren't so bad but if you can improve it in some way you should do so, I had to play the game on low quality so yea I'm just glad I was able to play this game without a problem, the only game that still blows my mind away is xcom.    Balance Between Challenging and Impossible: 76/100 (Doesn't as points)    Yes it's Scaled at 76, Because holy ♥♥♥♥ when you get to play as the plane you get screwed over badly unless you are a pro at it then you'll still die at the end, Seriously I found it more fun playing as the plane then the character inside of it.    Other: 65/100    Alright so my suggestions for this game is An actual story mode, like each character has their own story on they on the plane and “who” made it out alive out of the plane crash on an island with zombies going after you.   This game Needs a multiplayer right away to make the game more fun or put multiplayer for both story mode and survival mode, I was thinking of your character needing requirements to jump off the plane to end the wave.   I Do Recommend the game but wait until the developer updates it more.  Rated 273/400 ",
