            "review_text": "By and large one of the best running Unity action games I've played. Unfortunately a lack of interesting content and procedural variety, coupled with an MMO level of nearly imperceptible progression tied to a per centage chance enemy drop farming mechanic ultimately make the game a chore instead of an adrenalin rush. The painfully slow progression could've been overlooked entirely if the game were truly completely player skill based, but perplexingly Dreadbit chose to artificially limit the player's freedom to dodge with a two charge meter that has a cooldown period. The end result of this, in union with the built-in dynamic difficulty, is that when playing well you'll inevitably get to a point on the difficulty scale that you'll be getting hit with swarms of enemies that are simply impossible to avoid taking damage from with two dodges. This then enforces the grind, to survive *some* hits from 7.00+ difficulty enemies and to have enough DPS to avoid drawn out encounters, instead of making it a natural reward loop.   After bringing this up on the forum, Dreadbit did respond to me (I will say, always, kudos to developers taking part in their distribution communities), and the game apparently did at one point give the player complete freedom of movement; the restriction on it was actually an addition! The sentiment was that you could essentially fly with unlimited dodges, which is both an empowering (read: fun) mechanical concept and fitting for an angel. Dark Souls, and the stamina meter therein, was used as a point of reference for the logic behind the dodge cooldown. The problem with that notion is From meticulously hand crafts games tailored to a steady and deliberate pace, each encounter is give and take. Seraph on the other hand is essentially a hot procedural mess once you hit that 7.00 and up difficulty mark, vomiting out rainbow colored packs of 'elites' at you indefinitely, the majority of which just spam whatever special powers they spawned with. Ultimately, I simply can't abide by the decision to intentionally make a game less fun in the pursuit of emulating somebody else's mechanics, but I can't fault Dreadbit if that's the feel they're going for.    As it is at the time of this review, what you see in the trailer is basically all you get. There's a couple different environment backgrounds, two objective types to clear each floor, a handful of enemies and enemy ability modifiers, a handful of consumable ammo gun types, a handful of cooldown-based powers, and a core dodging mechanic designed to shackle the player instead of free them; which is actually fitting for the plot. With all this in mind, if you really like the trailer then go for it; its far from the worst way you could spend $12.99.",

            "review_text": "I just picked this up out of Early Access after having been on my radar for a while, and I must say I'm not disappointed. Combat is quite unforgiving, and might seem rough at first, but the controls are really tight and once you start to get the hang of it, you really see where the skill-based element lies: movement. It's fluid, responsive, and you will need to pull off some sweet acrobatics in order to progress. All levels being procedurally generated definitely gives this game a MetroidVania vibe, adding the risk/reward factor of exploration versus ascension. With the addition of the dynamic difficulty scaling on top, this game feels like the lovechild of Equilibrium and Risk of Rain. Except instead of Christian Bale you're a badass gun-wielding angel killing demons in a cyberpunk-tinged futuristic setting. Speaking of which, I also found the soundtrack to be quite enjoyable.

            "review_text": "Honestly, I think this game is absolutely fantastic.   Especially for the price, it's going to keep you entertained for many hours - the movement and fighting feels so fluid, it's an absolute joy to play. It's one of the few games that I can sit down, concentrate real hard and grind for a top score in a daily challenge or chuck on some chill music and zone out on survival or the story mode.   When I first got it, I was expecting the gem system to feel a bit cheap but it's there to keep you playing and it's not like it's unfair - at the end of the day, if you're not good at the game then all the gems in the world won't help you.   Also, I tweeted at the devs with some improvements that could be made to the daily challenge - not only did they tweet back but they're actually working on implementing the idea in the next patch. That's always fantastic to see in a company, being able to take and use constructive feedback.  As for the negatives, it could probably do with more varience in level objectives but there's only so much you can do when it's generated content - and pretty much all the fun comes from fighting the enemies of which there are a multitude of not only forms but enhancements that they can each have.   The soundtrack for the game itself is not exactly inspiring but it's also very fitting of the theme and well made to boot.   I've already posted top times for the Daily Challenges and hope to do so many more times in the future - awesome little game  Well done, Dreadbit!",

            "review_text": "With the constant deluge of generic indie coin-collecting platformers the video game market in general has been drowning in for the past decade or so now, it was pleasant to play a fresh breath of the mostly forgotten sub-genre of the action sidescrolling platformer again with Seraph. While I enjoyed the majority of the game, I cannot recommend it because of the poor level design, an inability to backtrack or grind, and the monumental difficulty spike with the last boss.   Akin to 2D shooters of old like Abuse and the original Duke Nukem, Seraph is about shooting your way from one side of a level to another while unlocking some doors and grabbing ammo along the way. To put it simply, this is essentially a 2D 'FPS' game with full auto-aim: Seraph requires you to focus on dodging attacks and performing acrobatics to transverse a level instead of gathering rings or saving animals. This auto-aim system helps create a more cinematic experience by greatly increasing the combat speed and encouraging flashy movement instead of spending time every enemy counter mouse aiming. However, this is often detrimental to long range combat and against faster enemies; you will often find yourself being required to be point-blank to get shots in despite having no melee system against mostly melee opponents. Several abilities also require you to be close-range for them to trigger or work properly which feels more like an intentional concession to the auto-aim rather than adding variety to the combat system. All problems aside, the combat is mostly good and is unique enough alone to make this worth playing.  Sadly, no amount of good combat can salvage a game with miserable level design. Being a modern indie game means Seraph has procedurally generated levels which it of course doesn't do well. If I didn't know better I'd think the devs only made 5 unique rooms, flipped them, added some connectors, and threw them into a randomizer. You can add a new coat of paint with a few different tilesets but its painfully obvious that no one cared about the level design when you see the same rooms every level (with each level taking about ~5 mins to finish!). Some of the larger maps I actually got lost in and wished there was a map function (not because of any maze-like level design but because everything looked the same!). I would've really preferred fewer hand-made maps than the mess of random junk maps this poor game received instead.  As the difficulty rose and I struggled to finish the last few maps, I really wished I had some way of backtracking to level up my 'account' more. Again, being an indie game in 2016, this game has a system comparable to permadeath with no level select option. Dying in this will set you back to your most recent checkpoint which, not only can be several maps prior, but also interrupts the storyline flow by making you replay map's intro &amp; outro dialogue. The only real way to grind up your character's permanent stats is by doing daily quests and survival missions on the leaderboards. While it's a nice attempt to create a community, a once per day challenge that only pays out once the challenge is closed isn't very conductive towards reaching goals with your character's growth.   Why would you need to grind in a sidescrolling platformer? I didn't feel the need to until I reached the last boss which was an absolute nightmare. Playing on a seemingly average difficulty of 5.5 (I got downgraded several times from dying on the last maps), it took me probably 3 of my 9 hours of game time on Seraph to beat him. A combination of fast-tracking homing shots, teleporting full body-sized AoEs, a PBAoE on the boss that is larger than his hitbox (and pops up when you get close to him), and heavy randomization on both numbers of shots and time between shots makes this a bullethell boss without access to bombs. I was ready to uninstall several times because no build or weapon type seemed to work. As far as I can tell, I just got lucky with the volleys he decided to fire the time I beat him. A truly miserable experience that is further unsatisfying by the cut-to-credits ending.  Overall, Seraph is a decent game. There are unique concepts here and a real effort at lore &amp; world-building despite being a simple auto-aim shooter. I want to recommend this because I enjoyed most of the game but I can't because of the apparent traps of modern indie game design. Helmed by a more competent developer I imagine this could've been GOTY material; Instead, Seraph is just another indie platformer but with guns and demons instead of coins and cute animals.",

Even though you're not aiming, there's such a frenetic feeling of freedom in the game and it is an enjoyment to play. That last boss, though. Eff that guy. He has a super high difficulty spike from even the level you find him on, and although he telegraphs his moves (if he's close enough to see) it still feels like an overly difficult cheap ♥♥♥ final boss.  I would, however, definitely recommend this game. Well worth the money. Just... that boss... uugh.  8/10",

However, between the trite story, and and extremely bland and montonous level 'design', I can't recommend the game. This is a good example of how to rely too heavily on procedural generation. There are plenty of games that implement level generation well, but it doesn't feel right here -- you've seen one level, you've seen them all. This implementation stunts the pacing, and doesn't provide an interesting or convincing setting, and this makes it feel kind of unfinished; it's just bland.  There is a good game in here that could be great with some work; worth keeping an eye on, but it still just kinda feels like a early access game.",

Not only do you unlock abilities, latent abilities and such, but you can 'rebirth' yourself, to restart with higher bonuses @_@  4)There's a story here, and I aim to figure it out! 5) VERY fogiving gameplay - the game adjusts it's difficulty on the fly, so if you aren't great.. the game will dynamically adjust things for you, conversely, as you get better, he difficulty goes up, and with that comes more exp and bonuses ^^ Very nice way to make the game an enjoyable challenge for all skill types! 6)Graphics are very pleasing to the eye, the game runs very smoothly  I've only played a short while, but the game shows you everything that is availble to you the instant you can get it, it's a nice system in place to show players how things work ( the emotes, forexample- they are worth 3x as much exp if you pick them up asap, they quickly turn into smaller ones if you don't grab em fast)incentive to kill enemies at close range! NIce way to make players not snipe foes out from a distance and suck all thefun out!  I'll add more to this as my experience changes (or not) I have yet to see a boss, although I have a feeling one is right after this floor I'm on! haha!

The dash mechanics are really useful for staying out of reach of enemies, dodging their attacks and getting around rapidly. Combined with the jumping, wall slides and wall jumps this makes for some great acrobatic gameplay that is honestly rather awesome.  Game looks really nice also. Really on point UI and character/enemy models/animations.    And the soundtrack. As a fan of Neuro and Neuro-inspired music it really appeals to me. It could maybe do with more in the way of level music but the quality of the existing music helps take your mind of its' repetitive nature.",
