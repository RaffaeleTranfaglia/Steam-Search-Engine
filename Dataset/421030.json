Basically:  You rob someone's base. You get the money. You store it in your base. Someone robs your base. They get your money. You add guards. You watch the intruders get chased away. You laugh. You get roses and upgrade. You steal more money. You rob more bases. You store more money in your base. More people rob your base. More people get your money. You add more guards. You watch more intruders get chased away. You laugh more. You get more roses to upgrade... .....  ...  This is an awesome game, just buy it FFS.",
