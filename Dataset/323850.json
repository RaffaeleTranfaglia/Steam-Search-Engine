            "review_text": "This game is great fun when you actually get to play a match with a low ping host, but I have the same experience as many other reviewers. There needs to be a MASSIVE improvement with match-making.   One flaw is getting a message appearing on the main screen that 'x player' is seeking players for a match, I try to join their server, the game attempts to connect and after some time boots me back to the menu. This happens constantly.  I get kicked by hosts that should have their server set to private if they only want friends.  The server list itself bounces around too much making it difficult to select a specific server (and then often get kicked after managing to select it!). Should be able to filter private matches or matches in play.  The biggest gripe though is connecting to servers with MASSIVE pings! Which makes the game unplayable, resulting in having to abandon the match followed by a warning message that I will get penalised experience points! I don't want to abandon, I want to play!!  The game itself is great fun, the experience in trying to get an online game is not. This game also records win %'s. So if you're matched to a 900 ping server, there goes your win %!!  If you plan to only play this local OR if you have friends that live geographically nearby then I can highly recommend the purchase. The party games are varied and fun and the code works well.  If you are planning to buy this to play random people online then I'd steer well clear unless the developer improves match-making, displays pings or hires local servers to connect to. ",

It's a great party game, LAN game, or with just a couple of friends. Playing SIngleplayer is meh, but you don't really buy this game for the Singleplayer aspect. Plus you can unlock things by gaining levels by playing with friends, so you don't really have to grind out Singleplayer to unlock all the content of the game if you don't want to fly solo.   If you want a game that is fun, well-priced, constantly updated with a community that is active and super cool, Move or Die is the game for you! Super satisfied with the product.

PeerToPeer system..... Means lag almost in every game 4. Drop system like in CS:GO meaning you can get dupes 3-4 times in a row. And get usualy LOW tier items 5. Almost noone online at all times u must wait 5-10 min till someone joins your game to play online, and quits if you start to win him which means you dont get exp for that game, then you wait another 5-10 mins for someone to join.

            "review_text": "I have to say I was quite excited for this game to come out, being a fan of local couch competition as well as online play with friends. This game has it all on paper, complete with grinding incentives and lots of potential for long replay value, customization and friend competition. The trailer had me, hook, line and sinker, and it seems like everyone is giving this game rave reviews. Honestly the game is great on paper, the graphics are great, the controls are simple and this game is easy to pick up.  Here's the problem, This type of game hinges on 2 concepts: -Multiplayer competition with friends whether local or online -Tight engaging fast gameplay with variety  Unfortunately the multiplayer is completely broken at the moment, you basically have to create or find a room and just sit there and wait. The game isn't well populated so you'll end up in a room with a high lvl individual who will probably start the match with just you and some bots as he's probably been waiting for 20 minutes.  Once you finally get to play you get treated to extreme lag (unless you're host apparently) I'm on a solid wired connection and play games such as Brawlhalla with zero lag whatsoever. It really pains me to say this but even if you can get past these gamebreaking issues, the gameplay itself is actually quite bland and unimaginative and very repetitive at the moment. The devs are saying free DLC and sure there's the workshop I suppose, but a full game at release needs a variety of engaging minigames. It's like buying Mario Party at full price and finding out that you only have 5 minigames for now but you're free to wait for the community to make some new ones... The game claims variety but the minigames are all so similar in look and feel that you may as well be playing the same 20 second mini-game over and over again.  The graphics are nice IMO but the game suffered from performance issues and constant frame drops for me and my system is well past the purported system requirements. I have much more than 1 gig of ram and 512 mb of video memory.... These aren't even specific requirements and seem to be quite watered down for a game that clearly needs optimization and polish. Either way I can't get this game to run at 60fps consistently and this game is all about split second controls. I'd understand if the system requirements were honest but they're simply not or else I'd be getting a smooth experience with the video settings at near minimum.  In all honesty I bought the game, I messed with the gfx settings, played the tutorial, popped right into multiplayer (well after trying to find a server and all that), the experience was as listed above, I gave it a few tries, realized I was bored stiff and playing an alpha basically and requested a refund.  I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone as it's not complete. I was testing the game for me and 4 friends because I was leery about this title. The plan was to get a four pack basically and play together but the game simply isn't engaging enough to be local, and the online is broken. Also I read in another review that apparently you do not progress or unlock anything in local, you must be online, but online is, once again, broken (didn't bother trying the local because we'd mostly be playing online anyways)  Solid reccomendations: For Online And Local: Brawlhalla (This one is free, online and local, with no lag, and they're still in beta) Local only but omg buy a case of beer and invite 3 buddies over: Samurai Gunn (THIS IS THE LOCAL COUCH FRIENDSHIP RUINING GAME TRUST)  TL/DR: This game is great on paper, promises to deliver so much but is broken in it's present state. It's in alpha.. early beta at best. I really hate to bash on an indie title but at 15$, and claiming to be a fully released game? Nope. If it's testing that's required early access was the route with an honest memo. Especially if the multiplayer is the focus and local is an afterthought (ie you can't unlock anything unless you play online) then your multiplayer is expected to be smooth as butter and you're expected to have servers. This game may be fun one day, but not today.  Parting words: I could MAYBE recommend this game for young children for local play. At 15$ you'll have a cute colorful game that might get a few laughs. If you have a family and game with your kids this might be worth considering, try it with steam refund policy with your kids and see if they like it. If you're an adult looking for a party game to pwn your friends at Smash Bros style you'll most likely be let down and much better served with the two titles I suggested (one of which is free to play but not pay to win). Note that this game was marketed as a party competition game for adults so I reviewed it as such and that this is just my opinion. Honestly with steam's refund policy you can always just try it :)",

I dont know if that game is video card or processor oriented, but the game runs awsome on a i5 4th gen and gt 820m, good job with that, the game fells good on all high with FXAAx4 and off post processing (puteti sa il mai optimizati putin totusi, pt ca se cam simte diferenta dintre x16 si x8 destul de tare, dar si dintre x8 si x4 destul de mult)  Third: gameplay. Indie game with a lot of minigames, but the run minigame is very repetitive, with the same map every time, and the cleaning the wall minigame same thing. In rest, all the other minigames are ok, if not great (felicitari!)  Four: Price (ro) Stiu ca nu ati mai avut buget sa continuati, dar totusi pretul e umpicel cam umflat, nu va simtiti ofensati, dar si acea reducere de 10% ar fi trebuit sa fie cam de 10 euro, astfel mai multi oameni aveau bugetul sa isi ieie jocul, dar inca o data, nu va simtiti ofensati pe treaba asta, inteleg ca trebuie sa luati profit, dar sper ca la Steam Summer sale sa aveti o reducere mai mare, daca doriti bine inteles.
