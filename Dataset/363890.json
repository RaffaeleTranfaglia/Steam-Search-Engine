            "review_text": "An easy to use game maker engine that builds off the foundation set by its predecessors. I say 'game maker' rather than RPG maker because it has the potential to create other genres such as action, adventure and visual novel games, just like the previous engines.  Its simple and familiar look makes it easily accessible to people who have already used any of the previous engines, and is approachable to people new to it as well. It contains more features than any of the previous engines. JavaScript looks formidable compared to Ruby, but everything can be learned in time. The character generator has much better parts than the Ace one, and even provides a base and parts for their sideview battles.  Despite the familiar appearance, it has been remade completely, so bugs are expected from something so new. I've only encountered graphical bugs so far, but none of the lag mentioned (using a 4 year old i5 laptop with a generic graphics card that has update-to-date drivers). Just need to point out that practically every single program and game out there has bugs on release. The important thing is that the reported issues are being fixed, the developers just need time.  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and glad to have it despite the bugs. Kudos to the Degica team who worked so hard to see this program released this early, and who are still dealing with the issues related to the program together with Kadokawa.",

            "review_text": "RPG Maker advertizes itself as being simple enough for a child, but powerful enough for a professional. As someone who has herself programmed games the hard way, I can assure you that this statement is true. For the new game developer, RPG Maker provides a nice framework to understand how mechanics and gameplay can mesh with story and helps learn the basics of game design - how to telegraph things to your players, how to make enemies an appropriate strength, etc. For those who know how to do that, RPG Maker trims the fat, saving you the time of having to program different elemental types while still giving you the option to modify it if you want. And that, I think, is the power of this tool. It presents you with so many options to get you started, but can do so much more if you know how to code.",

            "review_text": "Although on the surface MV might look 'the same', but underneath the hood it's a completely different beast. MV outshines everything Ace has and out does it on several levels. Thanks to Javascript and a open UI, programming is MUCH more flexible and will allow more possibilities with the engine then what Ruby could provide. Plus just basic changes with the default engine itself: Better Default Resolution (By default 1K, but with Yanfly's Core Plugins it can be set to 2K and higher), An more organized database to easily go through the tabs and change what you need, and the best part for last, An In-Game editor. As someone who pays close attention to detail when ever I had to playtest a game and saw something that needed changing, you had to close the game, bring back up the editor, change it, and go back to the area to see the fix. This was specially annoying when it was during a long cutscene. And when it was multiple problems it's hard to remember what needs fixing or tweaking when going back to the editor, so you could be stuck going back and forth for hours trying to fix the problem. But thanks to the In-Game editor I can easily fix something while the game still runs without having to go back and forth. This cuts down on development time signifcantly. I highly recommand this for anyone new to the RM scene, returning veterns, or upgraders of older RM engines looking for more possibilities.",

            "review_text": "RPG Maker MV is an a great addition to the RPG Maker Series. I first started using RPG Maker VX Ace approximately two years ago and it was then that I fell in love with the software.  As with RPG Maker VX Ace, MV offers the tools to make an old JRPG styled game with ease. Unlike Ace however, MV is built on JavaScript whilst Ace used Ruby. JavaScript is much more powerful and enables more flexibility in my opinion when it comes to creating/applying plugins. &lt;--- Keep in mind that the scripting part is optional, you do not need any coding to be create an amazing RPG Game. Granted it does help add features to make your games unique.  Pros: - Great Community: I absolutely love the RM Community, you can find tons of resources, tutorials and scripts to use in your projects. The community is quite active, so if you have any questions feel free to ask them. - High Res - (48x48): Compared to VXAce, MV now has a resolution scale allowing for a higher level of quality for sprites and mapping. Always a nice addition. - Tons of customisation options: The character generator has taken a big jump in flexibility since VXAce, allowing for more customisation of faces and sprites. Oh and you can import your own generator parts! The sprite sheets produced also contain more sprites for various situations, side battlers, damage etc. - Easy to learn: As with all RMs, it's pretty easy to get around once you learn the basic functions. - New Prebuilt Side Battler Mode: You can now take the side battler approach for your games as opposed to front facing approach (for battle sequences). This could only be achieved by using a custom script before. - Export to Mac/Android/iOS/PC : A nice feature that enables you to export your commercial/non-commercial projects.  Cons: I'm slightly biased as I absolutely love this software, but I have come across some minor issues that do create additional work when I'm creating my game. - Bugs and Glitches: The software is still relatively new (relative to the original date of this review), so there are some minor bugs still present. In my case, I found some issues with the shadow tool. Certain shaded areas would render when the games were executed. These were usually fixed though by erasing and re-tiling the affected areas.  So do I recommend this software? Absolutely!!! Although, if you're new to the series, I suggest you start of with an older varient such as VX Ace which can usually be found for cheap during sales and on bundle sites such as Humble Bundle and Bundle Stars.  I give this software, 10/10.",

Being interested in game development, but failing to start because of massive setbacks such as designing characters, creating a setting, and having no direction. However, with the pre-made assets you are able to prototype, prototype, and prototype. I stress this because understanding what you're doing will make you better and faster at making a game. You don't particularly need a story, a whole bunch of characters, or designed assets - the whole point is to understand game dev, and is most definitely worth the price. If you can, get it on sale!  I'm actually interested in the battle mechanics and events. I assure you that you can make a great game if the battle system is fun! Note that I only have about 100+ hours right now, but I still want to keep making and perfecting my game even if all I am working on is battle mechanics and events. It will never be released, but nothing won't stop you if you keep learning about the mechnics of the engine. Javascript makes it extremely flexible.   And as others have said, plug-ins make the process of creation so easy, and there are many free resources online! If you're a beginner and need to experience making an RPG by all means go for this. The continued support for Javascript plug-ins doesn't hurt either.",

It was flexible, but somehow I felt the scripting language was not modern and will be removed someday.  Now RPG Maker MV fully replaced RGSS with Javascript and it also support plugins, which greatly extend engine features. After 10+ years of time, I purchased MV just for supporting the developers.

With the inclusion of Javascript over Ruby, it is far easier to both create your own plugins, or use other people's created plugins.  The program has the potential to put out quality games in the JRPG and action adventure genre, and with Javascript you could potentially spread this to other Genres as well.   overall, this is a worthwhile purchase if you have an interest in making games but are intimidated by bigger engines like Cryengine or Unreal engine, or you just want to make a fan JRPG / professional JRPG.",

Its been a while since rpg maker was this good (last one I liked was rpg maker xp) but rpg maker mv finally brings back the side view option for battles and it now supports more platforms like mac, browser and mobile for releasing your game on the app stores.  Plugin support is already pretty good with lots of custom menu and battle tweaks, although theres no action battle system plugins yet like there was for past rpg makers so you can't make a zelda like game just yet, but the rpg maker community is already putting out tons of content and tutorials to make working with this engine really easy.

There are a number of add-ons you can find and some titles with the right amount of work can come out very well. With this title, literally anyone is capable of making a decent game after mastering a few simple concepts. If they can find the commitment to finish...  I would reccomend this title to anyone who wishes to play around with making simple games and advancing their story telling skills but my reccomendation comes with a warning.  This is the first RPG Maker version that is Mac 'compatable.' I use quotes because on different Mac machines including a 2015 Macbook Pro Retina, the title suffers from an irritating crash issue. When editing events and typing dialogues, I cannot tell you how many times the title simply exits. No error message, no option to save work, no way to recover what you have done. To work around this as a Mac user, save frequently, and do not type longer dialogues without stopping multiple times to save. Other than that, this title works almost flawlessly doing what it was designed for.",

I do need some way to import a VX Ace project to MV so I don't have to restart everything. I do need the ability to disable the RTP to make the download size smaller. At least include the characters from the cover art in the actual software instead of DLC, you know?! It's very new, but there are far too many problems for me to just accept it.

RPG Maker games have been given a bad reputation for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fangames, and most of them are... But then someone comes out of no where with something real neato.   But I suppose I should talk about the actual program, right?  As the name implies, you make RPG's. You can only make RPG's, because it's RPG Maker. It comes with a whole bunch of default music, tilesets, enemy sprites, and even a character generator. All are free for commercial use. You can obviously import custom graphics and music if you're an artist or musician. I'm not, so I just upload ♥♥♥♥♥ that I made in MS Paint.  10/10 would make RPG's again.  If you don't want to fall under the stereotype of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fangame RPG, then I would recommend importing custom stuff. I would also recommend the use of Plugins. Yes, Plugins. If you know javascript, you can write and import any kind of plugin to spice up your game a bit. Or if you have no idea how to do a javascript, you can just take some plugins off of the forums, provided that they're free to use. I highly recommend using plugins by Yanfly, because they make some real neato plugins that are real neato, and free for commercial use. These can be anything from easier menu management, or completely changing the battle system.   RPG Maker requires no actual programming. Did I mention that? RPG Maker uses something similar to Scratch. It's hard to describe, so I won't. Look at the screenshots or some ♥♥♥♥ idk.  RPG Maker MV can export to Windows, Mac, iPhone or Android. The hard part about exporting to iPhone is getting that sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ onto the appstore, because ♥♥♥♥ Apple. You can charge a price, or put it out for free. Just make sure the stuff you use is free for commercial use if you decide to sell your ♥♥♥♥ game.  RPG Maker MV is some good ♥♥♥♥. Ever since I got RPG Maker, I've gotten so many ladies that I'm practically drowning. Now you can trick people into thinking you're a game designer but in reality you make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sonic fan-RPG's.   10/10 would make meme games again.",

Game can be edited while you are in-game, and changes made to maps are live (just open and close menu to update). Event changes will require you to re-enter the map to update. Database and plugin changes require you to close and reload the game. 4. Switches and variables can be controlled in-game. Just press F9. Very helpful for testing events in-game. 5. A lot of support and updates from community.  Criticisms: Default graphics may be too 'squarish' for those who want to map circular stuff. You can find resources for this though. Auto-shadowing of tiles can be a disaster. Shadowing tool is hard to use. You can't click and drag a rectangle of shadow; you must draw it carefully like a pencil.  Conclusion: Worth buying.

I really like that they changed the Ruby scripts to JavaScript plugins which well helps me a lot since I actually know JavaScript. Oh by the way you do not need coding knowledge, it is mostly for advance stuff. The whole exporting to different OS is very very neat and you can even run your games in a browser!

You will most likely have to learn JS just to disable it.) and the maps have a restriction because of mobile devices. (Pretty much, they expect you to code out the click to move and not to mention, make your own .apk files, but think you're too dumb to code for conversion to phones for maps.) But, the engine is still useful none the less. Ace with a little bit extra. Oh, and if you're looking to get this because you think it has improved on the mapping, think twice. The mapping is the exact same as Ace, with (-Rolls eyes.-) the allowance of letting the upper corners overlap. Yep, they lishened to us, and really delievered on that,",
