You begin building a fort. You see someone else doing an entirely different thing. Are you doing it wrong? One guy is putting trap blocks over a hole, another is digging a large tunnel with water, another is creating rooms packed with traps and class shops. Who is right and who is wrong?  All of you are right! This game encourages creativity. Using what's around you and turning it against your enemies. A shark in a pit killing soldiers? Turn it into a trap. Enemies built a wall? Launch yourself in a catapult. It is all these different ways to play that make every game so fun.   Assume they are putting heavy siege upon your walls. Off the top of my head, you can: - Build tunnels for a constant stream of defense. - Fill a boat with explosives and ram it into them.  - Get a boat full of builders to destroy the small base they built. - Build walls behind the wall that is under siege - Dozens of more ways, for you to discover! To counter these: - Have builders climb up using ladders to destroy the tunnel. - Sacrifice yourself by turning the boat back into their wall, toppling it over into their base.  - Knights to stab the builders. - Put your catapult on a boat for a constant push on each wall.  TL:DR, King Arthurs gold is a fun game that encourages creativity to defeat your enemies. 9/10",

            "review_text": "This is my first review of any game so I'm just going to start out with the basics.  Pros:  -Three diverse classes to choose from, each with there own specific roles. -Fairly easy to build.  -Not much cookie cutting of any blocks.  -Each block can be used for more than just its intended purpose, increasing the possiblities for building. -Numerous maps -Archer gets an awesome grappling hook! -Knight gets to blow people up! -Builder can drop boulders on face! -Diverse selection of vehicles  Cons: -Nothing determines what players you go against (You could end up with team full of people who have played less then 5 hours of the game, Or end up against people who've played over 100 hours) -Toxic community -Steep learning curve -Controls aren't very good(If you spam stab as a knight to much, it will cause him to just keep stabbing over and over and over again till at some point he stops. Or as the builder, you try to destroy some stone on the wall, you end up destroying the ladder your standing on.) -Not very many game types to choose from(CTF, Take the Halls, Zombies, and Team deathmatch but barely anyone plays anything other than CTF) -Still a few pretty bad glitches (probably only for mac though)  Summary: This is a really fun game that has a few rough edges, but still great fun with friends and random strangers alike. Unfortunatly, the community is pretty toxic and you will probably be going against pros most of the times (pro knights are such a pain, and are almost completly unstoppable). If you give yourself time to get good and can ingore the toxic players, then you'll really enjoy this selection!  P.S. sorry for my bad grammar and spelling and less then pro game critic skills",

The combat system is for me what makes this game really special. I have spent most of my time in game practicing knight combat. If you like fighting games such as Smash Bros then the combat here will likely appeal to you a lot. The knight has only a few skills, but there are a huge number of ways in which they can be combined. There is little better feeling in this game than going on a huge kill streak.  As the best games should be - it is simple to learn but takes many, many hours to master!  There is a small but very dedicated community. Don't worry about there not being enough players. It only takes around 12 players for a good game of capture the flag, or just 6 for team deathmatch. At the time of writing there are always 60-100 players online.",

Or you can be an archer who has a grappling hook that you can use to parkour around and shoot people from trees. You can also crouch as an archer which makes you look like your dead so I have feighed my death many times to get past enemy lines. Lastly you can be a builder to make traps with spikes or make a castle for the rest of your team and then change classes while your traps rack up kills. In General these are the good things about this game.  Good combat: If you have decent amount of skill you can pretty much be a god with a sword or an Archer who can parkour around. Fun Buildings: Spikes, tree choppers, catapults, ballistas, those are the buildings in the game that you can use to farm kills and make an impenatrable fortress. Flaws of this Game Needs a Larger Community: More players! It is rare to find a game with more than 8 people in it, Even then those eight people will leave and their is no-one to replace them.  Upgrade Mechanic. You have to vote to choose what upgrades to use, and the system is somewhat difficult for a team to decide what to use. This may have been an old bug but You are unable to build the mounted bow turret. Overall this is a good game with the steam sale and the fighting mechanics you shoud try it.",

When I wanted a harder challenge I would fight as an archer or knight, Where I was treated with lots of deaths as my body was continuously stabbed, shot and blown up. Needless to say Kag has many things for people to experience, it even allows for people to create their own servers and make their own mods.  I have seen some interesting mods such Role-playing, or just bunnies turning into zombies, a overhead view with people making ships to blow each other up, and just different maps if you start getting tired of the old ones.  Did I mention zombies, yeah it's got zombies, mods with zombies, yep got that too.  and for those who don't always want to play with others there is a sandbox mode for you to go and play around in( or that role-playing mode as long as you don't make anyone mad, and A save the princess mode where you fight through several maps too save a dazzling beauty.

            "review_text": "2013 Game of the Year, hands down.  With apologies to Risk of Rain - it was pretty close.  King Arthur's Gold is just absolutely wonderful. From the lovely chiptune music to the diversity of the classes, to the way the map transforms over time and eventually collapses into the ocean, it's an almost perfect red vs blue game and one of the best retro games I've ever played.  There are only three classes, but what's so nice about them is they vary in playstyle, skill ceiling, and complexity. This is a game good and bad players can enjoy together. It's a game kids and adults can play against each other.  The knight is essentially pick up &amp; play, very easy to learn and difficult to cause problems for teammates while learning. The archer is a bit more advanced but allows for players still getting their bearings (or who just aren't very good) to stay reliably out of harm's way while still contributing to the team objective.  For the advanced player, the builder has a complex range of tools, materials, and duties which are the meat &amp; potatoes of this game, because it's the builder who makes the fortifications and defenses, designs the traps, determines the base layout, and is crucial to the infiltration of the enemy base. There is also resource management to consider here.  All of this stuff can lead to long contests, and in fact the map can become so wrecked that there's a 'map ruined' option under the vote menu. This slow destruction of the level is more fun than it sounds, though. If one side decides to hold out and refuses the reset vote, you'll see pitched battles underwater, hunts in the collapsing and flooding tunnel systems, and probably more drowning than you'll encounter in all your other games combined.  The end result of all this delicious chaos is a rambling, relaxing mashup of Fat Princess, Ace of Spades, Worms, Terraria; and of course the great forgotten SNES classic King Arthur's World, from which KAG took much of its inspiration.  I cannot lavish enough praise on this game. There's even a solid co-op zombie mod if you haven't tired of zombies yet, complete with deep base building and boss portals to destroy. It's a surprisingly slow-paced and often suspenseful take on the genre, the likes of which we haven't seen since Urban Dead. Certainly not for everyone, but worth mention.  The rest of this game though -  that's  for everyone. Nobody should be without KAG. It's as good as multiplayer gets.",

You can use your smartness to include some blocks that could trap the enemy or make only your team be able to use it. You can also mine and dig tunnels or go in offensive building agains the enemy. Since Physics is included you can knock down theyre building and then get the flag. As a knight you have 3 attack types Normal slash, Heavy slash and Double Heavy Slash. Knights can also like the builder buy things. As builders can buy Drills, Sawmills, sponges, lanterns and buckets and trampolines Knights can buy Bombs, Waterbombs, Mines and Kegs. Also the Archer class can be very usefull He has two attacks a normal shot at any strength or a tripple or double or one heavy shot. Archers can also buy arrows. E.g Fire arrows for setting wood on fire and water arrows to stun Also most deadly the bomb arrows to explode enmy defences. This game also included boats which can be sailed across the waters and used as faster transport or just siege weapons and spawn location E.g the big warboat that can fire Explosive balista bolts and used as a spawn point. Also it has a massive ram in ht efront preventing enemys from entering the ship or going above past the ship. The type of blocks in this game are also Dirt, Dirt walls, Stone, Stone walls, Wood, Wood walls, Platforms , Trap blocks, Spikes , Stone Doors, Wood Doors, Bedrock, Stone ore, Larger Stone ore, Ladder and workshops.

You can use your smartness to include some blocks that could trap the enemy or make only your team be able to use it. You can also mine and dig tunnels or go in offensive building agains the enemy. Since Physics is included you can knock down theyre building and then get the flag. As a knight you have 3 attack types Normal slash, Heavy slash and Double Heavy Slash. Knights can also like the builder buy things. As builders can buy Drills, Sawmills, sponges, lanterns and buckets and trampolines Knights can buy Bombs, Waterbombs, Mines and Kegs. Also the Archer class can be very usefull He has two attacks a normal shot at any strength or a tripple or double or one heavy shot. Archers can also buy arrows. E.g Fire arrows for setting wood on fire and water arrows to stun Also most deadly the bomb arrows to explode enmy defences. This game also included boats which can be sailed across the waters and used as faster transport or just siege weapons and spawn location E.g the big warboat that can fire Explosive balista bolts and used as a spawn point. Also it has a massive ram in ht efront preventing enemys from entering the ship or going above past the ship. The type of blocks in this game are also Dirt, Dirt walls, Stone, Stone walls, Wood, Wood walls, Platforms , Trap blocks, Spikes , Stone Doors, Wood Doors, Bedrock, Stone ore, Larger Stone ore, Ladder and workshops. I reccomend this game as it is very intresting , fun and addictive i hope this helped you get a better idea",

I love the ideas of building epic structures and working together with your team to take them down with siege weaponry and cunning, unfortunately this is not usually how the matches end up. You'll go into a game hoping to create a grand structure, but you'll be one of two, or maybe the only, builder and it's just not possible to build anything large by yourself, you simply can't gather and hold enough resources to create it before the enemy shows up. And then they do... wave after wave of knights carrying keg bombs, just laying waste to your creations. Who needs a catapult when a cheap as dirt explosive does twice the damage? It's stupid, makes no sense, and ruins most matches. Then there's the lag, I'm not sure if it's happening to anyone else, but i meet the requirements to run the game and it does run very smoothly when I'm playing alone, but then i hit the servers and it all goes to hell. The match will start off fairly smooth, but then it will degrade as the match goes on. By the end I'm moving at slideshow speeds of a frame every couple seconds. MY ping is between 30-100 most days so i really don't know what's going on. I really have to wonder how people with higher pings even manage to stomach it. I tried turning on faster graphics and that literally made things worse, when it is supposed to speed them up. I find it difficult to recommend the game, but i will as if the problems i've described are fixed it will be a great title. Right now as it stands it's either fun as hell or oh-my-god-someone-give-me-a-gun-I'm-going-to-kill-that-son-of-a- kind of experience depending on your luck at the servers. So if we could just raise the cost of keg bombs, decrease their damage, get a bigger player base, and fix the framerates this game would be excellent.",

The game is fun if you get into it and take the time to learn some of the things it has to offer (learning is not to long, and even then its worth. Trust me.) All these people with their negative reviews only bought it when the DDoS was happening, got butthurt, and didn't both to change the review after it was fixed. The game would have a review up at about 92% without all these crap reviews, easily. It is a masterpiece of a game that keeps giving and giving no matter how many years pass by. It is an infinite supply of joy and entertainment that I have been blessed to have enjoyed for 3 years. The community is great, and you will be able to find some KAG friends in no time. Hell, it might even be me. I have somehow managed to build a close connection to this game. It sounds really weird but there is just something about it, I don't know what by I am always compelled to play it even if there are no servers i like or if its empty.

I can't explain it completely, but no match is the same. There are three stages to every match. The building stage, marked by a grace period to build and stuff, the... in-between phase, marked by people dashing around just trying to make enough cash to buy a massive bomb, and the final phase, marked by someone actually managing to coordinate an attack, which ends up decimating the other team and making an insane war-zone of death and chaos.  The only con I can think of is the very chaos that makes it so original. When you start playing, it is incredibly confusing, and you end up failing a lot.

Their hasn't been any big 'game chaning' updates for a long time as Geti (one of the developers) said that their done with that sort of stuff and are just doing bug fixes/patches from now on. I feel as though KAG has way more potentional then they have given it but maybe their will be a KAG 2 one day? lots of people still play and it hasn't died! so I highly recommended buying this game if you believe you will play it, it also has a small (but reasonable) competitive scene if you're into that kinda thing too!",

Along with the controls, there are many button combos that can perform dash moves, devestating attacks, and quick escapes. The classes are a main feature in this game. There's the knight, the archer, and the builder. The builder is essentially the heart of the team. This class can build war machines, defenses, castles, spawn stations, and tunnels through the desrtuctible enviroment of the map. The knight is the one that charges in hacking and slashing. They have the ability to use bombs and several sword attacks. And don't forget the shield, an important factor in combat. The archer is the ranged attacker. With light armor and a deadly bow and arrow, the archer is quick and deadly. This class has the classic bow and arrow, but also a grappling hook, for daring advances and quick escapes. Another great future is the destructible enviroment. The bombs launched by kinghts will leave holes below your feet along with blood and dismembered limbs. Arrows will stick to everything, including human flesh. The gamemodes are fun and creative like the Create-Your-Own Castle and defend it (Take the Halls), Team Deathmatch, CTF, Zombie Fortress, and Challenges (minigames).

I'm far from a pro at the time of writing this review.   First off, there is a very tactical base for the game. With larger teams and maps, it requires strategy to take down a large fort.

The building aspect of the game works great in terms of engine technology, but the balance between building and destruction is like 1:10 to destruction.

Admins enable their friends griefing, some of them grief themselves. The vote kick/ban system has no memory, so the toxic players just come back the next day even if they are removed one day for bad actions. No global ban list, no meaningful moderation by adults. The classes that were once reasonably well balanced are now unbalanced so badly a single player can hero-mode through entire castles/teams. It's really not worth any amount of money at this point, far better similar games out there - I would suggest one of those.

Multiplayer will actually play out much like modern FPS games. Yes, there are rocket jumping knights in this game. Here are the unique abilities of each class:  Archer: Grappling Hook, Charge Attack (fires 3 arrows if you keep clicking), Fire 4 arrow types (normal, water, fire, bomb). Builder: Mine, Build, Deconstruct. Builders make all things including workshops to manufacture items for the other classes. Knight: Block, Charge Attack (breaks through block, usually killing the other knight if you know how to cheat, and I don't), Use Bombs (water and explosive), use heavy demolition, fly with shield (further with chicken), bomb jump, weaker deconstruct (knights can chop through wood and dirt, but must bomb through stone). They can also surf over rough terrain using their shield.   As you can imagine most multiplayer sessions devolve into rushing for bombs and demolitions and then most players switch to knights because they are so overpowered. The game could be much better than what it is with a few simple changes to the knight (remove charge attack, have shield only block arrows and melee, make stone blocks tougher, remove supply drops). But as it stands the combat oriented players will win every time over builders and their traps.  It would also be nice if you could make a custom castle or fortress and then use that at the beginning of every game rather than having to rebuild it at the start of each new game. Sadly I cannot recommend the game in its current state, which feels very pre-alpha to me.  Edit: I forgot to add that very occasionally you will hear a strange glitchy (loud) noise and every member of your team will die. There is some cheating in this game. Be warned.",

I went to the options panel on the menu, but nothing. Nothing about fullscreen or the resolution, just controls and other nonsense. It took me 5 minutes to find on google that you had to change it BEFORE pressing play on the little window that pops up. Why not just put it in the settings? Is it some sort of limitation on the software used to create the game?  So, after fixing up my resolution, I decide to play a little bit of sandbox. And god it's horrible. Back in the old time of KAG, it had a simple building layout, with 8 things on it. Simple and easy. Now you have all these wires and lamps and other bullcrap that don't actually need using.

I was always able to find a full server, even if that meant playing on overseas servers, although you risk getting temp-banned for high ping (rare though, but be aware that you should have a good internet connection).  Pros:   Explosives &amp; dynamic options to leverage physics (bomb jumping if you shield down on a bomb, for example)   Castle building with interesting mechanics including team-only doors, and 2 types of block material   Easy to jump into a game   Plenty of mods, and also completely moddable via LUA Mods include Role-playing modes, extra vehicles and weapons, entirely new games like Shiprekt and Bunnyfection   Relatively fast matches (less so since the update where you can repair over damaged blocks)   Cons:   It can run slowly on a lot of computers, because the code is apparently unoptimized afaik (devs have mentionned they're trying to get this fixed but their company head is slow to approve patches)   Occasional glitches (including animation glitches which are frustrating because they can completely mask what an enemy is holding)   No way to stop macro users (a mouse macro can completely break this game, disagree or not it is actually a bigger problem than some people realize)   I want to give this a thumbs up, but in the current state a lot of matches either go to server crashes or ties which can get kind of boring. You also need a fairly good rig to have this game play smoothly (sorry non-pc master race).  If the pros outweight the cons to you though, this may be worth a buy, it just happens to be right on a tipping point for me though where I can't recommend it to everyone (and I sincerely apologize to the devs, because I think they are actually trying really hard to fix it).",
