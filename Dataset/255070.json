If you like Dark Souls or roguelikes (roguelites?) then Abyss Odyssey will intrigue you. I haven't poked around all of its secrets yet, but I've had a blast so far and will keep going. While it's not as weird as Zeno Clash, it definitely has the same charm with a unique setting and interesting visuals and music. It rules that Atlus keeps putting out these weird ♥♥♥ PC games on Steam.",

But, the control is too laggy for pc player, simple moves must be made be pressing many different keys and the moves are not clean enough, i.e. leaving too much gaps for emeny attacks especially if you play ghost monk and surrounded by 3 mobs like the peacock or jackel. the skills of each charater are also slightly unbalanced. on the 3rd charater i rarely use the special attack since it is too slow and merely disrupt enemy attack.  but still, this game resembles an old school 8 bit game so anyone looking for a challenging should try it.

Reading through some of the reviews I see many people complaining about 'difficult controls' or 'bad gameplay' which to my mind feel very unjustified because all gameplay elements are very thought through and serve a purpose. If you actually take your time to look at the control scheme and how to play, you will realise that most negative reviews are just people who didn't spent a single minute of their time to even learn the basics not to mention the actual depth of this game.  You are able to: ✘ cancel attacks into special attacks, dodges, dodge-jumps, allowing for large combo strings ✘ short hop, fast fall and utilise the momentum of your airdodges, similiar to wavedashing in Super Smash Bros Melee ✘ switch characters mid-combo for further strings  It is true that you are unable to change directions mid-combo, but this just adds to the experience of having to make a commitment when attacking an enemy. Given the fact that there is no collision detection for enemy or player models and and the actually viable AI of most opponents, like in many fighting games, positioning is very important and knowing when to attack and when not. The missing collision detection also makes escaping easier when outnumbered or stuck in a tight spot, which you definately will be at times since enemies have their own unique moveset and never feel trivial (except slugs and spiders maybe).  As a huge Souls fan and supporter of the fighting game community i definitely recommend this unique piece of art.",

            "review_text": "Abyss Odyssey offers what feels like a cross between a Souls-like and Street Fighter-like approach to complex combat mechanics amidst a gorgeous, sometimes whimsical, eerie 2D background. Yes, the controls can feel counter-intuitive and frustrating as others have mentioned, but once you get into the groove of dashing, parrying, and cancelling out of and into actions and abilities, fighting begins to feel extremely rewarding. You will most definitely want to use a controller.  Enemy AI is sophisticated enough to make battle feel like a UFC squaredance. Foes read you, and they are quite good at it. They anticipate moves and react accordingly. Hitboxes are fair and accurate. Enemies often provide enough time and space between moments of engagement to allow you some room for planning attacks. Add to this the fact that each character has unique moves and skill sets, and the main playable characters have ability unlocks and customizable loadouts, and you have a ton of great replayability. There are plenty of characters to master as you collect the souls of monsters you encounter, including some boss souls--gotta catch 'em all!  Itemization leaves a little something to be desired. The few weapons and items available have standard fantasy attributes (fire, ice, poison, curse, charm), and while they look aesthetically pleasing, help destroy foes more easily, and add another nice layer of complexity and fun to combat (especially charming and freezing), more could have been done by the developers to diversify and add to the repertoire.  If you enjoy rewarding difficulty with precision control mastery, stunning art and music, smooth pacing from stage to stage, and a fairly unique spin on 2D action platforming, get this at full price or on sale. Either way, it's worth it.",

            "review_text": "The way i would describe it by compairing games, is 'rouge legacy' combined with 'tobal NO.1' for ps1  Problems: control / feel, Item labels / information, content / length, special moves, AI.  Control / feel: game controls almost perfectly. The only problem i would face is when trying to jump and grab onto ledges, and jumping onto platforms you can pass through.  The problem with ledge grabing comes from not being able to turn your character mid jump, and that the character automaticly turns when doing a wall slide. The character can only climb when facing the ledge, so many times when i would try and climb up a ledge (uses the same buttons as wallslide) i would go for a wall slide and then change direction.  The problem with the platforms is that you can pass through the platform by holding jump and UP or down on the joypad.  I have a habbit of holding up in games when jumping on passable ledges specificaly so I dont go through, so i had to retrain my self on that habit. There is also a problem when it comes to using a special move to go up higher than your jump I set the jump specials to UP and special, which will automaticly cause me to fall through the platforms aswell.  Item labels: There is a lack of infortmation in game.  The game is very basic and simple, so it is not a big fault point. That is unless you are like me, and love to have clear information on gear that your character equips. The problem is, main items have its damage values, and the magic effect / level. extra gear such as belts and rings may raise the magic effects stats by percentages, but I am not givin the base information on the main item to know excatly if what I have is doing anything significant.  Content / length: The game feels short, and the main core of the game does not have alot of substance to it.  Leveling only gives you the ability to add three stats to your special ablities, damage, damage reduction, add mana, a maximum of 3 times to each skill. The characters stats increase automaticly and are hidden.  There are only a few special core events e.g.: buy hidden random stat till death, get a free item to be attacked later, certain walls only break to certain weapons.  I beat the game in about 4 hours, and again in about 45 min to an hour and half. (I have yet to play nightmare or experiance everything)  Replayablity feels limited, I expect people will get about 4 hours out of this game before moving on.  I did fight a random boss after the last time I beat the game, and started another playthrough. I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me, but I have yet to see if it will happen again. I hate the feeling of missed oppertunity that may never return.(I returned, beat the game and the special boss a couple of more times, all playthroughs felt the same).  I have mixed feelings on the AI because it does feel like they use input cheats, but at the same time I am not a programer, but I still think that is a neccessary thing for a fast pace fighting game. My feelings are the A.I feels balanced and not overly cheap.  Pros:  Simple combat with a basic set of moves that are easy to preform. game feels easy and natural to play.  Graphics look awesome I give it a 10 for these reasons: Easy on the eyes, interesting to look at, little details, I can tell what and where things are, platforms and walkways are clear, hidden walls are not overly hidden.  In game story is simple. I skipped the starting cutscene, but still got what i think is all the story. The story is non intrusive to the gameplay. Each character is diffrent, e.g.: stats, speed, move set, specials, feel.  Nothing feels tacked on.  For a rougelite (intent to die alot, random level / item generation). I never felt the game was overly hard or impossible. Even the end boss fight felt “fair” in terms of fighting games.  Unlockable content for free as people play. I would rather have it as I beat the game and not others.  My thoughts and description:  This game is a side scrolling beatum up/random generated scenarios rpg. It was alot of fun and some what challanging without being overly frustrating. There was some controls to get use to, but it didn't take long to get use to; with the exception of the cons i put above. This is a game that I recommend because there is no other game similar to it that I would recommend over it. A nich game for sure.",

            "review_text": "  Summary:   A game that may not have the longevity to warrant comparisons to Rogue Legacy, but definitely has a unique battle system that relies more of slow but pointed movement. The combat system at its core felt like a good changeup for the genre as it reminded me of having influences from fencing, and it's complemented by a beautiful art style and a great soundtrack. The game does have content problems, as it's corridors and enemies do start to grow stale over time, especially in the layout department. However, combat surprisingly never felt TOO repetitive for me due to its mechanics, and I disagree with a lot of users saying that the controls are bad for the game: they perfectly fit in for what the combat was trying to do. In the end, the mixed rating on Steam really surprised me about Abyss Odyssey: I felt the game did give a great experience that stood out from others in the genre, and is definitely worth a look for fans looking for a slower, but more detailed combat experience in the end.

However what this game lacks in smooth gameplay, it tries it's hardest to make up for in looks and variety. The game looks absolutely stunning, and the designs of the characters are varied and interesting. The different areas are all great, but I wish there was a little more variety in them. Once you've seen one particular 'tileset' you've seen all the permutations of it.  The combat, which should be the core of the game feels a little bit 'floaty'. This doesn't feel great for what is essentially a fighting game. Sometimes moves that look like they should be hitting just go through enemies completely, and this just makes the combat feel not that great at times. It's still serviceable and has a ton of depth since you can capture enemy souls and play as them, which is the main draw of the game. Each enemy has a pretty distinct moveset and while some are clearly better than others each enemy has their own style and this gives a ton of replay value for the game.  This replayability is much needed, since the game is actually kind of easy. I played this both co-op and solo, and the solo experience actually felt a lot easier. Enemies are more passive when you are alone and usually come at you one at a time. While in co-op play you usually tend to get ganged up on and comboed by multiple enemies at a time which makes the experience frustrating at times.  All in all amazing art and music, decent combat, fun exploration and good replayability make this an overall great experience.",

It's basically a 2D version of Demon's Souls (not to diminish the designer's work, it's just to give you an idea of what kind of game to expect) with random generated areas. Very good music, wonderful art, lot of playable characters and combat styles. Unfortunately it's not a masterpiece though: the combat mechanics could have been improved and since the game is basically a fighting game this is a bit of a problem. I'm not saying that the combat is bad like I've read on many reviews, far from it. It just could have been a bit better, some animations are a bit stiff, sometimes you feel like some moves link (or not) for random reasons, sometimes you don't feel the combat as you should and some fights are a bit cheap, depending on the combination of moves of your character compared to the opponent.

But, again, repitition and lack of depth are strong points. This game is ultimately about jumping in and going. It can be confusing when you are unable to pick up weapons (wrong character) or you find yourself playng as either a human (you died) or an enemy (you captured its spirit).

If you're familiar with Smash Bros. then the fighting will make sense to you, but the controls still take some getting used to. I wouldn't recommend playing with a keyboard. Grab a controller and give it a chance! It takes some skill, but eventually you'll be gracefully double jumping through the air and doing 10 hit combos.

Combat is geniunely deep, and you can't button mash your way to victory. Attempting to do so results in you getting steamrolled by the enemies, who have full movesets just like you do.   An interesting mechanic is that characters essentially have three 'layers' that must be destroyed before they die. The top layer is the stolen soul of an enemy. You can capture enemies and become them, being able to use their unique moveset and stats. But when you run out of health you go to the secpond layer, which is one of the three heroes you chose to play as. Finally, if you lose as your hero, you end up as an emergency character, and your goal is to now find an alter to revive yourself. Should you fail, and die as the emergency characyer you are kicked back to the first floor of the abyss, money and skills intact, to try again.   the atmosphere is beautiful, and truly dreamlike, and the audio is amazing.

My opinion of the game changed from mild dislike, to neutral, to active enjoyment. I'm glad I gave it a chance.  Things I liked: + Characters + Light, yet enjoyable story that you need to play to discover + Smooth combat mechanics + Art style + Every enemy is playable (nearly) + Plenty of randomly generated secrets to find  Things I didn't like: - Only 3 characters are selectable to start your game, two of which need unlocking - Forgettable soundtrack - Lack of variety to the power ups - The game doesn't do a good job of teaching you about the characters' abilities, though this is saved somewhat by an excellent tutorial by the devs on the steam forums. I had no idea there were more than 3 selectable 'moves' for each character.  Overall, I liked this game and while I'd hesitate at full price, when it's on sale, it's a bargain. I don't know if its fighting game elements are good from the perspective of someone who likes fighting games, as I'm awful at them.

I'm not saying it's bad, this game is REALLY fun and rewarding especially once you've got a hang of the controls.  The game is paced like your average rogue-lite these days, delve into a dungeon that's randomized everytime (although currently the biomes for the dungeon always stay the same) fight things to get exp and money, use money to buy weapons, potions, camp tokens (Checkpoints) along the way and try to reach the end to defeat the Warlock.  However some bits stick out, the game lets you keep all your gold through all your runs so no matter how much you fail, you'll always have your gold to buy better gear at the start with. Another thing is that your level is kind of... Not integrated with Roguelike elements. Basically it kind of starts getting a bit more like an RPG where dieing is a part of the game until you get strong enough. Your level never resets, letting you grind until you can just beat the game by having too high of a level, which lets you have more and more HP.  BUT! Then another element comes into play, where beating the game isn't the goal anymore. You see, this game has a 'Capturing' system that lets you take the souls of monsters your level or below and transform into them. Your mindset shifts from 'I want to beat the Warlock' to 'I want to capture and BECOME the Warlock'. Of course, the Warlock is at a high level, 70.  Now, from a gaming standpoint without having played this or something with a similar 'let you play as everything' system like Guardian Heroes, you'd think, 'Why would I play as monsters? Aren't they usually weaker than players?' In Abyss Odyssey, everything has the potential to be as good and if not better than the three player characters. Especially considering how free form this game's mechanics are. By that, I mean there's no limits or gimmicks with anything. Every single enemy and also the players all apply to the same Smash Bros. like combat mechanics, so everything can be grabbed and thrown no matter if it's the final boss or a random goon or even the player, everything has the same amount of fighting moves (the Heroes have more but you can only equip 3 at a time), and every enemy and player feel like they are strong enough to be able to go through the game. Of course, later monsters and bosses are more powerful but nothing feels too much like super weak throw away trash.  This mechanic also works it's way into earlier gameplay as well because monsters you capture have their own seperate health bars, you can only have one monster soul at a time but the game lets you switch to them at any time so they can either give you another character to play as in that run totaling to 3 (Hero, Soldier, Monster) increasing your survivability and letting you delve deeper.  Overall, I'd say this game is... Very niche. You have to like a lot of different game mechanics from various other games to really enjoy this. The game fights like Smash Bros. handles rogue-lites a bit like Rogue Legacy, platforms through dungeon areas like a Metroid-vania, lets you play as anything in the game (except small bugs that die in 1 hit) like Guardian Heroes or Code of Princess, and it also has Three Player Co-op with three characters that handle very differently almost giving it a Trine-ish feel, especially with the Art style.  If all of that in a jumble seems really awesome to you, there's no way you won't like this game, but if all of that sounds like it'd clash and make everything awkward and the game kind of... just flat out weird, I'd avoid it.  Still, for only $15, it's got enough content to match if not, surpass it's price point. Especially with the new content that was slyly promised for everyone beating the Warlock enough times.  [EDIT] Friendly fire is now toggleable but if you have it off you won't contribute to breaking the Warlocks mask. Think of it like a practice mode.  Dungeon variety could still use some more randomization since Biomes are still stationary, otherwise, it's a pretty enjoyable experience, especially with a friend.",

In a good way, of course. As of this writing, I only have an hour of play time in and there's a reason for that. My only beef with the game is that it's so unforgiving. An hour's worth of gameplay, and I have made so little progress, people have started nominating me for a position in the federal government. In order to respawn anywhere other than the starting area, you need a camp token. Where do you find them? Hell if I know. Some merchants (very few and far between) will sell one and only one, but they're ridiculously high, and you lose them permanently if you die. On rare occasions, you may stumble across one, but don't hold your breath. If you die (and you will die) you get one chance to respawn by means of fighting as a soldier until you reach an activated check point. My problem is that I've only found three tokens, of which I lost two, and my only activated checkpoint is a hell of a way away from anywhere I need or want to be.

With some customization, you can create your own combos while levelling up, choosing to add special abilities that will, if well chosen, make your combos longer.   Being able to transform into enemies and monsters is also really fun. Each monsters have their own combo sets and special abilities. I'm a little saddened by the fact that these do not have levels and customization of their own, but them having a different Health bar can be very useful.  The game is pretty hard. Until reaching a higher level, dying every time you enter a Hard floor isn't too surprising. Dodging and blocking is fully needed for survival. Jumping and grappling will also help a lot. Co-op mode is sadly very limited. Although it's fun, the camera always centers between both characters, and when a player goes too far, they disappear off-screen and can make things complicated. Friendly fire is also always on, and makes for very cautious battles, while enemies are not always affected by this.  All in all, the game is fun, but better to play solo, (Unless playing in Versus mode, which is like playing a fighting game with the characters unlocked through the story) unless you and your friend are used to difficult/fighting games.  Edit: The first patch will attend to some problems, as well as change something related to friendly fire being too harsh.",

Say goodbye to spectacle fighters' button-mashing and brawlers' single-button win-strategies. Abyss Odyssey's combat forces you to think before you act and make each move count. From zoning enemies using projectiles, to frame-canceling attacks into special moves. For all the good the game does, its tutorial is sparse and lacking, and puts players into the hotseat of 'die and learn'. The game's difficulty isn't excessive, with a single clear taking as little as a few hours of trial and error (your mileage may vary). If the game suffers from one single problem, it's the blatant input-reading that goes on during certain encounters. While this adds to the overall difficulty of the game, it's hard to tell whether an enemy is 'smart', or simply cheating.",

In this game, you need to learn the controls. You need to learn how the enemies fight and you need to build and adjust your characters skills and special attacks in order to progress.  Some have described Abyss Odyssey as a mix of Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Castlevania? That comparision is only partly correct: the gameplay reminds me a bit of Super Smash Bros Brawl, but not Castlevania. Unlike in Castlevania, in this game, you cannot just whip&amp;One-Shot-Kill basic enemies. A mob of low-level enemies can easily hack'n slash you into pieces, if you are not careful. Health vials are scarse, mana-vials are even more rare and good weapons cost a lot of coins. Did I mention there are no free save-points? In order to save progress, you need to grind enough coins, then you need to find a merchant who sells a camp token, and then you need to find an altar to use a camp token to have one or maybe two retries from that particular point.  The game graphics are sounds are awesome, but I am personally more attracted by the fair challenge of this game. The game is quite merciful to some degree: for example, dying does not automatically reset your character experience and it does not strip you from your special attacks you built, only your weapons and items are lost, and you are returned to one of the three starting stages.  I'd say learning to use different attacks and gradually proceeding in this game is the main hook, so for skill-oriented players looking for a bit of a challenge in a game, this is one to pick. The game is also very beautiful, has unique and interesting lore and is flawlessly designed.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Abyss Odyssey is a platform based fighting game with a bit of story, a randomized map, and a whole lot of crazy. A major facet of the game is that death is not the end; not necessarily even in each playthough. When the main character, one of either Katrien, a dead dude with hands but no body, or a sea goddess, dies, they are simply replaced by a soldier (still playable, of course) who can revive the main at certain alters. Only when the soldier dies must you restart. However, death only costs you your progress down and your current one items. Level, exp, and gold are kept.  This game has a special mechanic that adds one more layer in. The main can use a special skill and rip the soul from an enemy, gaining the ability to transform into any enemy, including all bosses. Dying as a monster turns you back to the main, adding another layer of life. Which you will need because the monsters are brutally unmercifully good at beating you to a pulp. The AI is intelligent and each monster knows its strengths. If a monster is fast but weak and you shield, it'll wait for a hard hitter to show up and they will tag-team you to death.  The story (for characters, primarily. There isnt much of a plot.) and art of the game are amazing. The story is that a powerful warlock is in a asleep in a coma or something, and his nightmares are materializing in the real world. As one of his dreams, you are trying to stop him. Characters and monster are primarily from old Chilean myth and folklore and also a considerable amount from the Christian bible, plus many from various other worldwide myths, all with the wonderful wackiness of ACE. Plus there is also a crossover character from Zeno Clash now.   Pros: Great visuals, music and designs. Every character/enemy is playable.  Either way: Difficulty. The game is brutal. There is no easy mode or tutorial. Only hard or harder. I like that, but not everyone does. Enemies are really smart and know you, so you have to know and exploit them. Finding ways to successfully spam attacks is generally rewarded with not dying. You can do it, but so can the enemies, so it could go either way. Animation cancelling is a major mechanic. This means that learning combos through hard trial and error is the best way and messing one up can mean a lost battle due to long animations. The mechanic is really cool though, so again, either way.  Cons: Controls can be a tad floaty, but its not that bad. Soldiers cannot jump as high as other characters, and I am bad at getting places with them. This is far more fruatrating than it sounds.   Verdict: Excellent game. I really enjoy(ed) it. If you've never played a fighting game, or don't like them, or you're really bad, then this isn't the game for you. However, it is excellent for those who are willing to climb its learning curve.   Notes: This is my first review. My apologies if I've messed absolutely everything up and offended everyone in the general vicinity.  Also, my playtime is very inaccurate. I've played it offline most of the time. Supposedly the multiplayer is good, but I haven't bothered with it yet.",

I could also tell you that there are technical flaws which harm the game in many ways, that the game is mostly balanced for playing alone and thus making the co-op modes nearly superfluous, not even counting the great technical flaws in the online co-op.  In the end I will say that it is possible to get used to the technical flaws and that there is a great charm in playing what is essentially Smash Bros. with a stamina-based cancelling mechanic in a simple, Roguelite map with fantastic art and presentation. It starts out hard, but gets easier as you get used to the mechanics.

Having never been competent at fighting games (I beat Street Fighter II on the SNES but once at difficulty 'III'), I admit I'm in over my head and instantly grateful for the weapon and moveset upgrading system. If I've any chance at all, that alone is to be thanked.  This is a lucious game, and there's a lot to love, if you're a genre fan. Awkward voiceovers can be overlooked, the base character leveling system gives less skilled players a chance. Unfortunately the character animations are quite stilted and lack the polish that would have better integrated them into the classic, 1890s art style.  For an indie, this is an impressive start but for full price this is too much to ask for casual players. This is no minor distraction, but a lore rich, gorgeously presented nightmare.

Consider buying it if you are on the fence, to support devs who do their best to change from criticism, but don't expect too much or you'll probably be disappointed.  ** /EDIT **  I heard the devs tuned the controls to make them more responsive, which is shocking, because the patched version is one of the most unresponsive brawlers I've ever played. It's Bad Dudes NES bad. Turning to face the other direction is a chore and moves spend more time finishing animations than they do starting them. Essentially, you're vulnerable whenever actual strategy is required, which means the only way to progress is to stay out of the action and spam cheap shots. This lack of engagement is only compounded by the limited number of attacks available. Not only is the combat unengaging, it is extremely reptitive.  The only thing that stops the game from being completely unplayable is that the AI is tuned to be moronic. This may be incidental, as the enemies are also designed to be player characters. Either way, they're adding nothing to the combat experience, other than cheap shots when you're facing the wrong direction.  I want to like this game, it's got many creative notions and the presentation is fantastic, but it's just not fun to play.

It would have been far better if it took the player's level and gave it any thought, but that is beyond Abyss Odyssey. While you do retain your money and experience even after a defeat, you unfortunately don't retain any items, adding to the frustration. The promise of playing as any number of characters is also similarly not what it is presented to be; an extremely unwieldy and difficult-to-use soul capture system, through the woefully slow-filling mana, is used to temporarily command that soul. All things considered, it's not really that worth bothering with. Additionally, the character designs for female characters in the game are elegant and beautiful, but of course male characters are either placeholders or hideous. Maybe if you like teeth-grindingly annoying 'roguelikes', you'll like this. But I personally found the promise far greater than the actual game itself.

            "review_text": "I echo the reviews of many here who note that incredible awkwardness and unresponsiveness of the controls -- especially the unreasonable difficulty in simply getting your character to face the right direction while enemies quickly and fluidly move around you. Animations lock you too easily and quickly.  The game is obtuse and offers almost no guidance on its quirky mechanics. And I suppose I could handle death penalty if it wasn't so random and out of your control -- sometimes you just get mobbed by 3 fluid, well-aiming enemies who simultaneously kill you very quickly while you struggle with just aiming the right direction. I don't want to grind for gold to replace expensive weapons so I can continue when that happens.  There are a lot of other minor complaints, like the common problem that it is VERY evident that the game was quickly ported over to PC from consoles with as little change as possible in UI and control scheme. Hint: ESC should not take you to main game menu from anywhere in the game; it should function as a 'back' button when you are in in-game menus. Do NOT require the player to press the B key to exit a menu on a PC game; we hate stuff like this. It's more irritating over time than it would first appear. In the world of PC ergonomics, it's like putting the doorbell button to your house on the mailbox 30 feet away from the door.  Again, like others, I was attracted by the art and music and visually fluid animations, but had enough of the unresponsive controls; and terrible, poorly-ported UI; and the death penalty + death by UI + need for grinding to get equipment again.  Note on hours played: I played a few hours on my son's account, so you can consider me as having about 4 hours in. If there is indeed a gem buried under the punitive barriers to entry, I couldn't bring myself to play further to see it.

There's no real combos because your moves hit them away from you. To actually get combos you have to juggle the poor enemy against a wall or use your super. All the reviews that are comparing it to smash bros are somewhat correct but mostly assanine and not really helpful. Lke in smash bros, if you hold up and press attack, you will do an attack that is known as an up tilt, and this applies to all the directions, like in smash bros. The same rule follows aerials but they don't really lead to combos that often either. That is literally the only thing this game has in common with smash bros. So do not think you will be getting a cool game where you can combo people. There's a super move you get to use when your mana becomes completely full that can get you a pretty decent combo relative to the rest of the game though. By that I mean around 6 hits, which doesn't even kill an enemy. Useful.  Edit: There's fast falling like in smash bros as well. There's also grabbing and rolling out of shielding, but that's kind of standard for these types of games.  You get three specials as well, and they are pretty easy to spam and honestly make quick work of the enemies usually. There's no real reason to use the regular attacks after you get them unlocked. Hell the first girl gets a fireball which is mediocre but then she gets a counter, which you can just stand still and spam then you get a pokey attack that seems to put the enemy in enough hitstun to follow up with another pokey attack.  There's random items throughout the map, which is randomly generated every time you die and go down there. There's weapons which can range from being incompatable with your character to being able to catch them on fire or freeze them. There's other passive armor type things and potions, antidotes and mana things you can pick up. Not much to say about that. Then there's these other items that you can activate that will let you completely transform into one of the enemy units. I have no clue if these are helpful in any parts but so far I find my character to be more comfortable to use.  Now, you're probably wondering why I bothered typing out most of that? It's because the tutorial does absolutely nothing to help you other than your movements and give you your first special ability. That's it.  I wouldn't recommend this game at $15. I wouldn't at $10. I might say it's acceptable at $5, which is what I think I picked it up for during the Autumn sale.

            "review_text": "Pretty basic fighting game with various problems.  But first the positive: -Nice game concept -Interesting background story -Fun for the first few hours -Potentially amazing genre-mixup  Now for the negative: -For one, there's only very limited characters to be played. -The character's power level varies widely (some are totally useless, others really op) -A lot of said characters (including the op ones) feel really clunky -The PvE feels dull and (especially the 'nightmare mode') often pretty unfair (enemies keep you stunned until you are dead etc.) -The 'skill system' seems like a nice touch at first but does not add any depth to the game because adding skillpoints to ceratin moves only increases either armor during the move, the mana gained or flat damage output -The 'special skill' is, again, a nice idea but poorly implemented. Every character has the same and it takes forever to gather the mana needed in order to cast one -During PvE you level up your hero. The problem here is that a levelup only gives very minor improvements to stats and a (pretty useless) skillpoint every now and then -Waiting times to find a PvP match are off limits. Seriously. I just kinda gave up after a while -The inventory system is really bad. You can only store 6 items, can't change their order, delete them or even use them under certain circumstances.  As a conclusion I would only recommend this game to the most hardcore Fighting/Platformer fans and/or people with a pretty high frustration tolerance. Everybody else should probably just play Street Fighter or some good old platformer",

The combat goes from too easy to way too difficult and swings wildy back and forth in each zone. Doesn't really have a good flow and feel to it.  Item balance is also a serious issue with the camp tokens costing way too much for what they are.

I'd like to post something along the lines of 'in spite of these difficuties' but the gameplay is terrible. They force you along you a main storyline to begin which is fine to learn your basics, but after floor 1 the kid gloves come off and you realize that they weren't making this for the players. It changes quickly from an experience that you think might be reminicent of a castlevania to wondering why there are no hit boxes for your enemies or yourself. My genuine complaint is about the mechanics. It seems like the designers wanted a beautiful game that could do a lot, but got kind of bored half way through the process. If they patch the hell out of it I'll be stoked, but as it stands it's not worth a couple bucks much less the $14.99 they're asking. If you're looking for something to dissapoint you go hit up walmart and get some Nancy Drew game compilation for two thirds of the price instead.",

The animation cancel mechanic (it lets you do a follow up atack and it has a cooldown of 3 sec, but you have to time it perfectly) is a nice touch. BUT the gameplay is so step by step, the fluidity of the character is 0, it almost feels like the got some photos and place one after another, the muvetment is dam annoying when you have to jump from a platform to another, because (you can jump 1 more time while in the air) the second jump fells like he was implemented so players dont anoy themselfs if they cant change the direction while flying from the 1st jump(just details, not important, but there are plenty and sadly not in the good way :\\ ) Now what I like about this game is the character sistem (actualy i ♥♥♥♥♥ hate that boar caracter, it just dont make any sense to play as a boar that looks like TripleH + Steroids and have those atacks that just apear as pictures, you know what i mean if you played SF 2), now if I imagine that boar wast there the character sistem is rly nice, it brings a little more diverity, even if the first 2 heroes have the same muve set and WOW GUES WHAT the first char throws a FIRE BALL {FORWARD}, o wait, what is that, the seond character WOW it can SHOOT a BULLET {FORWARD} Such unicity. I enjoied games like this and i still do : Ex1: Lost Saga Online (It's free, 3D,Better graphics,MUCH MORE AND UNIQUE HEROES indeed &lt;3, the bad thing : bcs of no funds, after 3 years of gaming it shuts down and after 6 months it opens again by another .srl) Ex2: Trine1,2,3 (It is a 2.5 like this but it has awesome gameplay and graphics, awesome to play with friends, it got some puzzels too, I highly recomand these one to be played with friends it's lot of fun for like 6h) The CONCLUSION for Abyss Odyssey : NO!

            "review_text": "Great concept, but too many things holding it back.   Abyss Odyssey has many things going for it: interesting story, nice graphics, an encapsulating theme. Unfortunately, it just doesn't feel right when you play it.  Tutorial: the tutorial is very sparse. Sure it shows you what it wants you to do, but doesn't tell you the right inputs to do them, or the intricacies, like the difference between double jumping when facing a wall vs not facing the wall, or even wall slides. They don't teach you what number button quaffs what potion.  Controls: The default controls are garbage, and should be reconfigured. Further, the tutorial doesn't really help you choose what suitable inputs should be. Ultimately, this leads to a lot of frustration for a player who want to just pick up and play.   Combat: Combat feels a little clunky. It's slowed down in the interest of making combos, but it feels unresponsive at times. The AI doesn't have large enough tells. You would expect that weak enemies would have obvious precursors to their attacks, as would strong enemies' strong attacks, but many of the attack animations appear quickly and often seem uninterruptable.   Lack of instruction is a problem here a well: There isn't any instruction as to how to combo. New players are left frustrated as the AI pile on multi hit attacks, while they are stuck with a basic 2 hit combo. Nothing tells players that the timing of the block matters in terms of breaking combos and counter-attacking.   I disliked being constrained into artificial combat areas to fight particular non-boss enemies. It seemed unnecessary, particularly when they were already using a key system as a gateway.   Also, being limited to fighting 1-3 enemies at a time was disappointing. I never felt overwhelmed by enemies, though at the beginning I did feel overpowered by them. Also, the enemies would often just stand still, waiting for your attacks! I felt as if I went to the bathroom and came back, the enemies would still be there waiting for me to make a move.   Death Mechanic: Personally I liked the death mechanic of having a second chance, with a weaker character until you could find a revive spot.   Environments: The levels are procedurally generated. Overall they felt luxurious, but sparse to me. I feel like there was a lot of wasted real estate, which could have been filled with smaller enemies. Unfortunately, the game seemed to want to focus on fighting one or two enemies at a time.   The relatively linear exploration was somewhat disappointing to me as well.   Inventory: You are allowed 1 weapon, 1 of each type of accessory, 1 soul transformation. If you want something else in a slot, you have to throw your current item away, and can't even sell it to a merchant. Very arcade video gamey, but not something I desire for a regular game. Would much rather have had a configurable inventory so I could switch swords.   Plot: The fight seemed inconsequential after your first death. You die, you get reincarnated. Simple. What were the soldiers fighting for? Why didn't they just stay home and avoid the abyss, only guarding the exits? Were the monster's stealing children, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ women, setting fires? Nah, the soldiers just wanted to commit suicide by jumping into an abyss to fight said monsters. A lot of wasted potential here.   Overall, this is a game with a lot of potential if you can get into it. However, it's lack of instruction, odd difficulty curve, slower combat system, and lack of drive will make it meh to most players.",
