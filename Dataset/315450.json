            "review_text": "PROS: - Each level introduces distinctively unique puzzles and new game mechanic. - Music is decent. - Artful game.  CONS: - Inconsistent difficulty throughout the game (some puzzles are poorly designed.) - User-unfriendly and minimalistic GUI and game menu for the sake of being overly artsy. - Slow and sluggish movement and so much gliding on a platform. - Unresponsive jump at the edges of a platform. - minor glitches (get stuck between moving ghosts, mislocated balloon tied with an ice spike, boomerang can launch you to somewhere off-screen; all very rare issues but when any of this happens, exiting the game is the only way of fixing it.)  . RECOMMENDED .",

            "review_text": "OK, so the game itself is well polished, smooth, and the level design is acceptable. It is best described as the result of putting eversion, limbo, and braid put into a blender. It has a touching story narrating my own future in a few years as well as reminding me of past grief in 2011. The game is also appropiately priced. However, this game is doomed to complete obscurity for the following reasons: - The name is abysmal, game names need to be googleable and distinguishable. Not only is 'bliss' a common english word, but its also the name of a different android game - No effort whatsoever was put into the settings, there are no settings in fact, it's not even possible to put the game into fullscreen and experience some immersion. This makes Bliss the polar opposite of Mortal Kombat X on launch day. - The game starts easy enough but after an hour or so it starts to approach IWBTG in terms of difficulty. This means the game will only appeal to hardcore gamers.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed this game! If you like Braid then this is a game for you. Some really smart puzzle mechanics and level design and it never felt like repetition. The ambience and art in the game is beautiful and I loved the story. I also love the fact that there are no single word in the whole game except the end credits.  Puzzles were conveniently challenging requiring even amount of platformer and puzzle solving skills. The bonus challenges punished me a lot(!!) till the point of rage quitting but I finally managed to squeeze the rest of the achievements.",
