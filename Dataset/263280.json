            "review_text": "Im sorry, no matter how much I want to like it, I just cant. I have listed complaints as suggestions to the developers. Multiplayer Complaints Random people join games and you cannot kick them if they are annoying. If the server crashes, then you loose connectivity on the client (well kinda obvious) but you also loose all progress (hours of work) There is no saving multiplayer. Multiplayer depends on the steam networking (i.e. you must be signed into steam) All Multiplayer vehicles of the same type spawn on top of each other, causing damage to vehicles due to collisions when you drive away There is no mechanism to drive another players vehicle Rejoining a game that you disconnected from (i.e. game crash) requires you to unlock all acheivements again (even if the server has stayed online). If another player switches trucks, it dissapears. If they switch back it reappears, even if you are driving on top of it. Complaints for the Game in General While the destructible mesh is great, and its really cool it remembers the form of destruction along with the heightmap, dont you think that its a little too much mud? Very far on the unrealistic side coming from a person who worked logging in the mountains. Spring runnoff only causes so much mud. Also while there are some awesome 3 meter mudholes, not every mudhole needs to be that deep. Realistically there should be a mechanism to dump pebbles into a mudhole, or more appropriatly sacrifice some poorly tapered logs to the worst mudholes. There needs to be a visible minimap, and perhaps a cab driving perspective (preferably with secondary cameras on each side showing the tire position). If you want to go for realism, only the drivers side. Gear shifting mechanics need to be adjusted (I dont know about Russian trucks, but many of this era truck had spider gears, or at least more than 3 gears). Furthermore the gear transitions are mouse based and non granular, this is problematic. What exactly is the crane for? It cant seem to move the trucks, nor pickup logs. Kinda cool, but wished it did something.   ",

There is a lot of judging the road ahead, trying to spot the areas to avoid so you don't ditch or spill the load, winching yourself out of mud and holes, winching another truck out, examining the map, etc, etc. You have to be relaxed or you will just get nowhere. The best part for me is just how immersive it all is. The truck models are top notch, the environment is thick and rich, and the way the mud squishes and deepens and exposes boulders is something I've never seen before... very realistic. And the physics and vehicle behavior all feel right; I mean, considering it's a video game. When it's night and you're alone on some muck-filled, forest path with crickets chirring and you're unsure where you might be, the sound of your mighty diesel is a very welcome thing. It takes a little while to get used to the game; especially the camera. Until you get used to that and a few other game controls, it's aggravating. I am glad I didn't give up on it and have been very happy with Spin Tires.",

            "review_text": "Almost exactly a year ago, when Philip Seymour Hoffman haven't yet died, defending New Zealand from Attila the Hun's ressurected zombie hordes, I got my hands on tech demo for Spintires for the first time. I haven't been the same person ever since.   Upon my birth Reptilians have planted a device in my head that lets them read my thoughts. For a reason unknown to me they established Oovee Game Studios (oh come on, doesn't THAT sound Reptilian?) and used all the information they gathered to create a video game of my dreams.   In Spintires you assume the role of a Soviet truck driver in 1980's Siberian woodlands where a concept of 'concrete roads' is considered an imperialists' attempt to weaken the USSR.  Your main task (and by far really the only one) is to pick up wooden logs from point A and deliver them to point B.  Easy, right? Well... IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥ NOT.   At the beginning you get max 2 vehicles - usually a jeep and a small truck. Jeep is purely for exploration purposes, in which it excels, while the truck, in theory capable of delivering small logs, is best in support role as it doesn't even have an all wheel drive. To be able to complete your task you have to start with exploration.   Your minimap is full of dark spots which you uncover driving near their centers. Knowing the terrain is critical in planning the route. Even the biggest trucks won't go through rivers and dense forests. You have to drive smart. But even the best route available won't promise you success if you don't have the right equipment. More trucks can be unlocked the same way as minimap which is driving near them.   All vehicles can be customised in garages, though the options available vary for each vehicle. Your trucks can carry spare parts (as trucks can be damaged), fuel (as some trucks may use even 20+ liters of fuel per MINUTE of driving), trailers for wooden logs in different sizes (there are 3 sizes of wooden logs). If your main truck is badly damaged or runs out of fuel you can use the other one, with proper equipment, to save it.   Whether exploring or completing the delivery your greatest enemy is Russia itself. It does what Russia does. It kills you. It devours you. It consumes both your truck and your very soul. This is where the ♥♥♥♥♥ gets serious. Physics in the game are simply marvellous. Trucks react to every bump, each wheel's suspension is independent, tires deform. Terrain is also gorgeous. Mud deforms under your wheels in real time and it stays deformed for as long as you play on the map, water behaves in a very natural way and you can mow down small trees.   The game is pretty difficult and it favors patience. Moving through the mud is slow and painful. More than once you will find yourself stuck or flipped upside down. In many times you will have to use the winch (it's a really helpful tool) or revert your truck back to garage (but only in casual mode. In hardcore mode if you're ♥♥♥♥♥ then you're ♥♥♥♥♥). The game is also moddable. First mods were released for closed beta which sounds promising for the future of this title. There's also multiplayer.   There are some downsides as well. Graphics are good but not the best, the only real task so far is delivering wood, the game saves your progress only on one map at once (if you want to play on another map all your progress is lost), maps are similar in many ways, draw distance could be better, lighting at night is pretty awkward AND THE WAY CAMERA WORKS IS A REAL BUMBERFUK. I don't want to sound like a fanboy (even though I am one) but I believe many of those problems will be fixed as both developers and community do their best.   You can download tech demo   BY CLICKING HERE YOU BLIND MOTHERFUKER   [oovee.chicsystems.net]  to see if the concept of Spintires seems to be appealing to you as I believe it will not be to many. Many of you fukers will be disgusted by it.   So should you buy it then?    Yes.    Because in the end the money you give to the developers, if not you, will at least benefit me, and honestly it's all that really matters.",

It's easy to get bogged, to flip, to lose your way. Those lacking persistence will get frustrated and quit.   I still have yet to successfully transport a single load of wood.  I got pretty far, but I hit a muddy hill and almost flipped my truck, had to winch out with a chain on a tree while hitting the gas. When I looked back all the logs had been dumped out except 3.  Almost no instructions, no tutorial. But this just adds to the mystery and challenge, it doesn't feel incomplete nor have I found a single bug. There's a great variety of vehicles, and even more variety in vehicle add ons, many of which I don't understand.  I'm not sure it is worth $25, but it'd definitely be worth $10.",

The water moves as you push forward into it, the mud sticks to the wheels and sprays backwards as your tyres spin furiously to gain traction, the gorgeous visuals coupled with immersive sounds of a wet muddy forest filled with wildlife and the vehicles you use to drive through all this makes for a unique gaming experience. There are 5 maps to explore, all of them are hidden beneath 'cloaking' points that need to be unlocked in order to reveal the areas hidden beneath them. You do this by driving around the map in a variety of vehicles that anyone who's played Dayz mod will instantly recognise.  The main objective of the game is to collect and deliver lumber. This is done by hauling small, medium or large logs around the map to a pre determined point. Youll drive through impossibly deep mud, fast running rivers, tall thick forests and still tranquil lakes. Youll also need to negotiate steep inclines, often muddy wet steep inclines that will require some measure of fore thought before attempting. If you get stuck you can always fall back on the handy winch feature that attachs to any nearby tree, enabling you to pull yourself out of trouble, which is inevitably where you'll end up.  Other vehicles aid you in the completion of this objective such as repair and fuel trucks. These all need to be driven by the player by swapping from one vehicle to another as they become unlocked on the map.  The one thing that lets this game down is the camera. You follow vehicles from an off centre perspective that works well when youre on the wider areas of the map, but as soon as things get tight the limitations of this become apparent. Trying to see where you're going when the scenery closes in, or when your're trying to save yourself from toppling over on one of the many steep inclines that run out of deep water crossings, can be frustrating. Thankfully this doesnt hurt the game to much but it does take something away from the gaming experience.  There is also a multiplayer option that enables you to basically do whats done in single player only you get to drive around with friends as well.  I like this game because it's challenging and is gorgeous to look at. It is one of those games that just grows on you the more you play it and the challenge to deliver those logs to there destination while negotiating the steep, muddy, rocky, wet, uneven and trecherous 'roads' you travel along, make for a rich and rewarding gaming experience.",

            "review_text": "Finally the real thing is here after years with tech demos.  Game is awesome, totally free roam with lots of challenges, but no closed Circuit, no point to point racing.....actually no racing at all, its all about trial and error where error spells disaster so u end up stuck, too damaged or out of fuel and hence u will soon enough learn to drive very carefully, just like u would irl.  The physics are superior to every other driving game ive ever tried (ive tried quite a few), Spintires has all the things we always wanted in an offroad game, manual diff lock, enable/disable AWD, winches and cranes.  You can even winch out ur fellow driver if hes stuck somewhere, bring fuel and/or repair his truck on site.  There are however some things that needs to get sorted, like the camera, its a chase-cam that can be moved a little using the mouse, but it acts in an annoying way that prevents u from seeing what u r actually looking for, because it centers the truck that makes it obstruct ur view.  Controls aren't always all that easy and not really explained anywhere in game, well some controls are, but things like how to operate the crane isn't, ive been struggling for 20 mins with it as it wont let me control one piston at a time, hence it moves both pistons in or out at the same time, making it impossible to use.  Theres nothing to find online, Ive googled several times for several things about the game, simple things like 'Spintires How to use the winch' aso., but I get zero results that has an actual answer, so it goes for the crane control, all I get is a video that demonstrates how it can move (controlling one piston at a time) but nothing about how its actually done.  So better/more extensive in game help (maybe even a tutorial), rewrite of the camera so itll move 'freely' and with the option of a wider perspective.  A fully manual gearbox would be nice too, so far u can choose from 4 gear lever positions 'Auto, 1st, rev' and a position that makes the engine stall.  Also manual reduction gear would come in handy a lot of the time, especially when passing over rocks where too much speed (approx. &gt;3 km/h (1.5 mph)) will cause damage to the truck. It would be good for going down steep hills as well, where ur truck otherwise gets some heavy dmg when u hit the bottom and for these things, even 1st gear allows for too much speed.  Despite these issues, I still think its incredible good quality compared to the issues we normally experience in other games just after release.  Ive been playing for a few hrs straight and never do I experience any lag or similar issues, everything just runs super smooth all the time, gfx are set on max all the way and im even on an old GF GTX470 gfx card, so the games graphics are indeed very light to run and I can see on my NVidia monitor, that it takes up about 500MB of VRAM, which isn't much by todays standards.  As far as for realism, ive never tried driving any of the vehicles irl, but I can say that driving that 6 wheeler in this game, is very much similar to driving the Hydrema 922 dumper, in the sense on how it handles at different speeds, going thru rough terrain etc., so ill say the game feels pretty real for most parts.  One thing they shd consider imo, is the rocks, they have weird physics and doesn't feel like rocks, also the truck tires has very little friction when passing over rocks which seems wrong and the rocks doesn't get squeezed into the mud when passing over them in well, mud.  All in all, if u like free roam off roading, buy the game, u wont regret it. :-)",

As downside, in first hours, you stumble on repetition in maps (COPY&gt;PASTE literally) and lack of content (more activities, vehicles, maps would be preferable), so question, how long it will bring joy. And poor support for mods in multiplayer!! this alone is substantial for longevity of such game.  So, in one word - GREAT! but looks more like extended tech demo, not a full featured game.",

It has interesting ground deformation that simualtes mud better than any other game I've played.  Even this early on this game is shining with potentail. Currently we only have 4 objectives per map; deliver lumber to the sawmills, uncloak the map, discover the extra trucks, and unlock all garages. And five mostly unique maps, I don't fully know how unique because after 40 hours of play I'm still playing around on the Coast map. As the game stands now I'd say it is well worth $30 but the Devs have proven diligent on this game and have delivered on thier promises thus far. They have promised more maps, more trucks, and more objectives. PLUS they are leaving the game open to the modding community. In just the tech demo alone modders created huge libraries of well built mods.   The bad, the camera controls are wonky and you can never seem to get the right view, the controls are rigid with only keyboard or xbox controls available (no steering wheels,) there are still some bugs with how collisions work and how the renders and with the latest hotpatch the biggest bug of getting your wheels stuck under the ground mesh seems solidly fixed.  I foresee myself logging a lot of hours on this game ",

Other then the fact the Developers seem to always be busy on vacations or in meetings, the rare occasion we get updates like the more recent one which added workshop support for vehicles is pretty good. They need to really get more maps included and workshop support for the modded maps asap, because this game's limited choice of 6 maps does get old rather quickly. The online multiplayer is pretty solid but it's menus are still very bare bones, and frustrating to use because you cannot name servers, and in general it just doesn't look very appealing. As far as networking goes, that is also something that's fairly broken and in about 30% of the times joining a server you will time-out or just freeze before loading the persons game.    All in all this game still rivals every other game for its mud physics which are quite amazing really and there's no other game on the market that pulls it off so perfectly. I really hope Rockstar games has seen this and taken note, games like gta could really use this procedual mud physics. Overall ill still give this game a 7/10 , as there's still much that's been promised and not fulfilled.",
