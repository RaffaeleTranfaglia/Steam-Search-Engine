            "review_text": "The riveting sequel to the established military sim franchise, this game offers an intrepid experience in the daily life of Cpl. Ben Kerry, a US marine stuck in on a greek island after being blindsided by the Greek army. This leads to a series of guerilla warefare missions engaging in enemies with a rag-tag group of American-friendly greek forces with a dreamy British leader. You eventually leave your small island to the much bigger island - Altis. Altis is very expansive and covers a wide array of terrain from the salt flats to mountainous regions. It boasts having several large cities and multiple airports. After arriving, you continue your mission with the greeks and the brits. I won't spoil the rest, but you're sure in for a ride.  The real meat of the game is the multiplayer though. Engaging in platoon sized battles between 50 real life people clearing a city against massive hordes of AI is exciting. The combat leaves you awe-struck as bullet modeling and bullet paths have been integrated flawlessly into the hands of the engine. Multiple vehicles, ranging from Main Battle Tanks to Anti-Air Vehicles, are available from the onset and spice any mission up. When you join a large group, it's utterly fantastic the amount of fun you can have. Imagine 50 other players running toward an objective while trying to dodge MG fire. That's the game's experience.   Actually, it's a ♥♥♥♥ strategy game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics that make you want to claw your eyes out. If you actually enjoy sudoku, get off the internet. Get Arma III instead, it isn't ♥♥♥♥.",

If you can count to nine and have enough patience you can solve the hardest sudoku puzzle. Zen of Sudoku offers a window based running option that I prefer while I do other things on my computational machinery. The charm of running it on a computer and not a booklet is that it corrects for you. Zen of Sudoku even offers in game help and guides if you are having a hard time getting started.  It's pretty. Nothing too fancy but it is enough. Sound is lacking but can be turned off.",
