I recomend this for people who want to play that kind of game   Long time since i was so disapointed in a game.. Buy 'Space rangers HD a war apart' instead.. This is far from what you expect after playing that..  Seriously the biggest letdown in gaming i have ever experienced...  Im going to try to force myself to play it some more.. Hopefully there is somthing good about it further inn...  Its only text quests...    Ill leave the recomendation because i like the franchise, but this is not a good game...  EDIT: I expected a different game.. This is probably a good game if you enjoyed that part of the old games..",
