            "review_text": "This is by far my favorite game to play now. I was a HUGE fan of the Zoo Tycoon franchise, and being that it isn't available on Steam (and my laptop has no disk drive) I downloaded the original 'Wildlife Park' to see how I like it. I LOVED IT, so I downloaded the 'Wild Creatures' expansion. Having loved that so much as well, I play this game more than any others I've gotten from Steam.   Bottom line: LOVE the original title and the 'Wild Creatures' expansion more than I ever loved Zoo Tycoon and it's entire franchise.  Yes, I would recommend this game to EVERYBODY that loved (or even just liked or enjoyed) Zoo Tycoon.",
