            "review_text": "First of all, don't sell me a game called 'Funk of Titans' if there's no actual funk music in it.  Second, just having your main character be a black dude with a huge afro who says 'Ah yeah' a lot... isn't funny or clever. I'm not even sure if it technically qualifies as a joke.  Third, the premise makes no sense. Funk fans don't hate rap or pop music. (It makes sense in the 'Frederic' games that the curmudgeonly classical pianist would detest pop. Funk fans, by contrast, tend to have more chill than that. And rap music is *derived* from funk, for gawd's sake).  Fourth, running games get pretty tedious very quickly on a computer. Playing for five minutes on a phone isn't so bad, when you're just killing time; devoting all your attention while sitting at your computer is a whole different story. (This one's kinda on me, though. I thought this was a straight platformer when I bought it, not a running game. Serves me right for not doing my homework).  Finally, credit where it's due: the game is put together fairly well... for an unfunny mobile game   with no freaking funk music in it.   If you're into running games, you'll find that the stages function the way they're supposed to, with the player being given adequate time to react to new obstacles. I only played seven levels and one boss battle before I got bored and asked for a refund, though, so I can't vouch for the rest of the game. (The boss 'battle', BTW, is basically just a quick-time event: press the correct arrow key when the prompt appears, and voila, you win).  If you really insist on buying this thing, get it on a mobile device to play in short spurts. For everyone else, here's a link to a   real funk fix.  ",

I played it over a few days and my playtime represents completing the game with 100% achievements. There were enough new dynamics to avoid feeling repitive every few levels. An overall good experience.",
