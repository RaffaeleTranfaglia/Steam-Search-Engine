            "review_text": "This game is terrible. The artstyle is decent enough, even if they got lazy and couldn't be bothered to create clouds and other background art in the voxel style, but everything else is awful. The controls are loose and sloppy, creating an unsatisfying feeling to the gameplay. The level-design is near non-existant, where about half of every level is just flat ground with an object for you to jump over here and there. Sometimes there would be some platforms for you to jump between, but then it was back to flat ground again for a while. Maybe that gets better as you go, but I played the first two worlds and only a couple of semi-interesting things happened.   The bosses were terrible, mechanically uninspired and boring too. The regular enemies are also irritating, because they randomly shoot at you if you get close. There's no rhyme or reason to their shooting and the bullets move so fast that dodging them intelligently is nigh impossible. You just have to keep jumping while slamming the fire button and hope you don't get hit. It's like Contra if Contra was crap.   On top of all this, it seems fairly low on content. As you may notice, I've only played 10 minutes and that was two worlds out of five or six. I even died and had to continue once, yet I still beat 1/5th of the game in 10 minutes! Basically, this game seems like it's an hour long. Maybe two. I'm not planning to find out.  At this point, I'm also going to point out that every level ends with a box popping up asking you if you want to keep playing or take this time to review their game. After every level. Could this game be a lazier mobile port?  That's not even to mention the obnoxious music. Oh, man, the music. It's going to hauntingly echo through my dreams for eternity. It sounds sort of like Teletubbies music, or something similar that your toddler cousin might adore. If you're older than 10, though, you will be muting this game if you decide to play it. The constant plop-plop-plop sound of your gun doesn't help.  In fact, the above is true for the whole game. If you have a four year old at home, they might get some enjoyment out of this game. It's simplistic, easy and obnoxious. Sounds perfect for a toddler! As an adult, I slogged through a few levels and couldn't deal with it anymore. When I fell through a glitched platform twice in a row, I quit out and uninstalled it.",

Graphics and simple controls make believe little childrens are supposed to play this, but by world 3 the platforming and enemies get ridiculously hard, you get frustrated and the dull music and constant popping of your gun drive you insane. I cannot recommend this game to anybody...",

It's good and all...but not original...enough...to be on Steam. Yes, I get it that you people wanted to share your iPhone/iPad app on Steam...but take money for something you can get for free on your phone? Seriously?  Just for that it gets an 5/10. Graphics are okay. But now gameplay... Who the heck though moving right while spamming shift was 'okay'?  That takes it down to a 3. Each level is unoriginal and repetitive, not to say frustrating. Also, no offense, music was kind of bad. I got this for 90% off...still kinda overpriced even though it was less than an euro.  3.5/10 Would not reccomend. Could've tried better.",

Pros: Playing on Fantastic The voxel graphics were fairly nice but in reality without any expectations they were pretty shoddy. Gameplay was not challenging at all but very casual with simple controls. Cons: Ridiculous checkpoints, Easy levels, Easy boss battles, Rubbish story. For the pricetag just buy it to make up your game collection. Its what I did and its pretty worth it.",
