            "review_text": "Toy Odyssey seems like a game that would be really good, and for short periods of time, it is. Unfortunately, it falls short (but just barely so) on nearly everything. I should also note that about 4-6 hours of gameplay were in offline mode.   Pros:   +Interesting concept:  The toy designs are all really interesting and the main character is pretty cool. The room design is well thought out and the story seems really good thus far.  +Good sound effects:  I can't exactly say why I noticed this, but the sound effects felt really fitting, given that you are literally a toy. I thought it was amazing that the player 'hears' from the perspective of an average-sized human being. Swords won't sound like swords, but like tiny toothpicks being swung. It's probably my favorite part of the game.  +Fun core gameplay:  Like all rogue-lites, the gameplay is compelling. There's always an urge to go a bit further, especially if there's the possibility of reward.  Cons:  -Repetitive, even for a rogue-lite:  Unfortunately, after a few runs through the house, I began to dread trekking through the first few rooms to get to a new area. Sure, the rat holes offer fast travel, but on some runs they barely appear, or appear in mostly useless places.  -Little to no rewards:  The first time I came across a chest and was greeted with a spinning card, I was excited to recieve a new weapon, as I was doing paltry damage to the other toys. Instead I was given a  blueprint  for a silver sword. I planned to craft it as soon as possible, but was told by the game that I needed to craft every sword  before  the silver sword before I could make my prized posession. I didn't have a single one of the blueprints for the previous weapons, and I still haven't obtained one, despite getting the blueprint very early in my gameplay.  -Glitchy Spawns:  Normally I wouldn't point this out in its own flaw section, but since it makes up the majority of my deaths, I believe it needs to be addressed. Sometimes I entered a room (usually from below) only to spawn on top of a group of enemies, taking massive damage and getting knocked away from the door. It feels like there is a 'anti-spawn radius' next to doors that enter from the side, but some enemies get projectiles or attacks that trigger so fast it seems like it needs to be bigger.  -Strange VA. sound balance issues, and poorly translated text:  The voice acting for the game is a bit strange. Some characters sound fine, and the base audio quality really shows in these characters, but others, like Brand, sound like they're reading the lines with a gun to their head, as fast as possible. The sound balance is also an issue, as sound effects (like in the baby room for example) are much louder than music and dialogue. This may be a problem with my sound system (as I've noticed it in a few other modern games), so don't take that point as absolute fact. The text, however, is poorly translated in some areas. It isn't a huge problem, and is still readable by all means, which is why I included it with two other minor points, but it is very noticeable.  Overall I wanted to like Toy Odyssey, but it pushed me away with a lot of tiny punches. It was at the top of my wishlist for months, so I was very disappointed to see it fall flat. There is a good chance I will play it more, and will change my review to reflect any changes in my opinion, but for now, I think it would be best to pass on this one.",

            "review_text": "While it shows some real promise and workmanship Toy Odyssey just feels incredibly stale and without any voice of it's own. From the types of enemies faced to the general graphical design and music it feels all over the place in it's inspiration and lacks any focus. Combat is stiff and platforming feels frustratingly sluggish. While I would normally give a game more than 30mins to give my verdict this just feels... off in a way that no amount of play time will alleviate.",

Mediocre story, voice action, and dialogue, but not enough to be a dealbreaker. Some mechanics (mostly the base mechanics) seem a bit anomolous to me at the moment, but not in a gamebreaking 'WHAT DO I DO' way.   So far, my experience has been 8/10 easily.",

Should pick it, especially for discount price",

            "review_text": "The game is fun but there are a couple issues: - Input lag (occasional but noticeable with an Xbox One controller) - Enemies spawning on top of you when entering a new area - Build times for buildings (should be reduced since it's very noticeable when marathon gaming) - Text errors everywhere (It looks like the game doesn't display apostrophes) - Recipe drops (drops should be changed so that they drop in order of upgrade paths rather than pretty random) - Ninja enemies stick way too close  If you like rogue-likes, give this game a try. It's not too difficult and the lore entries are entertaining (albeit a bit cliche).  Update **October 28, 2016** The dev team has shortened the building times greatly. I like this change (albeit a bit drastic). The addition of a visible crafting tree for weapons helps greatly as well. No longer will you build a weapon that may have no upgrade path.",
