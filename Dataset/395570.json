It features some truly alien landscapes filled with devious traps, cunning enemies and lots of ways to show off your personal skill. While all of that is incredibly fun the roller-coaster of a difficulty curve made my experience with We are the Dwarves a lot more frustrating than it needed to be, especially in the tutorial which is ironically the hardest part of the entire game.

It is something inbetween RTS and ARPG with a strong emphasis on the tactical aproach. You cannot just go and shoot enemies, you have to think, otherwise you''ll just die. I think it is great.",

I heard there were problems early on with this, but the seem to have fixed this.   I found the game to be brutally hard - I was frustrated when playing, but after finding out the correct paths for each level, I wanted to reach the end. A save game bug has so far prevented me from this - but the development team has mentioned they have found a solution for this and will push this out next update. That bug aside, I recommend this for people that truly enjoy a challenge.",

I was impressed by the combat system, which is real-time, but it allows you to slow down the time to queue up some commands for the dwarves. Players are free to decide on how to deal with enemies - whether using close combat or stealth. Another cool thing in this game is the vast variety of different abilities that game characters posess. All these factors create the unique playing experience. I can recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "I like the idea of this game to let dwarves to be main character and rts style game system. but I don't recommand this game because there are some flaws in control part.   1. control set is contrary to general game nowaday. For example LMB is giving command and RMB is rotate camera. Although it's not a big problem and aceptable. but I think it's better to follow main stream control set to let player play this game more easilly. 2. RMB cancel skill function doesn't work sometimes. have to click RMB several times to cancel skill. 3. Sometims can't click/select enemy even mosue on it.  Actually there're still some detail problem in this game. but I think to make a immediate and reliable control is the most basic and important thing for this game right now. This game is quite creative. I hope they can make a new game with this idea but more complete in the future.",

            "review_text": "Here are the first things I noticed about this game.  1. It's very pretty. 2. The voice acting is God awful. I might mute the voice acting and just read the subtitles. 3. The tutorial prompts are difficult to understand. It doesn't tell you a whole lot, which might be intentional or might be bad design. It's hard to tell. 4. It's very very hard. I can't tell you how many times I died in the starting area. Again, the game doesn't tell you how to be successful, so there's a lot of trial and error. That wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for... 5. The load times. Don't get me wrong, they're not very very long. Like, it's not NBA2k15, but considering how often you'll be dying, looking at the loading screens gets pretty infuriating.  6. It's satisfying. When you complete your goal you feel like a tactical badass, and that's because the game stacks its deck against you.  7. The atmosphere of the game is really cool. It makes you take an interest in the world, but not so much in the characters (probably because of the VA work.)   I'm gonna keep playing, and I'll probably update this review as I get more time under my belt, but right I'd say go for it. It isn't an expensive game, and it looks like some fun can be had here.
