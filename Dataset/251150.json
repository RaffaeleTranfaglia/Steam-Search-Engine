            "review_text": "Unbelievable world building and detail, well-developed characters, careful deliberate pacing (although slow due to having to set up a huge saga as its first entry) and a well-written script all contribute to creating a world that pulls you in and is populated by characters you care about. Despite the huge amount of text in this game (yeah by the way, stay away if you don't like reading) I found myself savoring each and every line in the game, even those by random NPCs. It's like reading a good fantasy novel, it really is the best world building and such work that I've seen in a JRPG, most likely ever.  That would be reason enough to jump in, but the RPG underneath that world is also fun, balanced, and somewhat nostalgic.  Battles have that 'everything matters' feeling, a sort of mix between a strategy game and a traditional RPG system. Character progression is tied to the story, but gets really good after about the midpoint in the game, and battles ramp up in strategic scope as you go along.  Overall, this should not be missed by fans of JRPGs, or anyone that enjoys good narrative and world building in video games, especially the more literary types who are accostumed to diving into fantasy novels and taking in all the details and workings of a fictional world to heart as it slowly unravels in your head. By the way, the random NPCs who roam around the village and such? The soldiers? The innkeepers? They have character arcs. Character. Arcs.  That's all. There's no overstating the narrative and world detail that goes into this series. Get it.",

            "review_text": "I played the original release of Frist Chapter back in 2006 and the Second Chapter in 2008, and now my son (4-yr-old) is playing the re-released on Steam. On a glance this is one of your staple JRPG: cute and seemingly clueless though motivated protagonists, tactical turn-based combat, heavy text-based menu and stats/mechanisms. But beneath that thin layer of disguise, you would have one of the most wonderfully made story-driven RPGs with a plot as dark as the Witcher series (dare I say) you have ever played--if you play all three entries you will reach the same conclusion.  Needless to say the story goes beyond the good vs. evil scheme, but characters in this game also evolve in a believable way. They are very aware of the changing world and interact with each other in meaningful ways. Suffice to say you won't find any one-dimensional character in this game, be it a protagonist or antagonist.   Also worth mentioning is the quality of English translation, which I believe has been to be marvelously done by professionals. It's almost like a re-interpretation of the source material--if you will--in Japanese. This definitely sets this game (and most likely its sequel--Second Chapter and the 3rd) apart from the likes of Final Fantasy and such.  You will probably find choke full o' troupes or clich√© common to comics and mangas in this game: - shadowy groups with profound motives beyond human comprehensions and far reach to every corner of the continent by all means fathomed by only the most conspiracy-minded individuals in the creative industry,; - mysterious enemy combatants ranked in number not by sheer strength but their legendary reputations; - villains turned out to be activists manipulated by a greater force each step of the way without a clue; - etc.  However if you can look past this and accept that most of the deeper story-driven games are more or less like this, and it's only a matter of expertise to conceal the usage of these troupes, then you will have a wonderful time like me to explore this universe--its lore and its characters. Not to mention this is one of the few REAL steampunk themed games available on PC, or even the entire industry, consider it being a niche not generally looked into. And if you are concerned about cliffhangers since this is the only the first entry, worry not--for each 'chapter'(game) conclude its story in a satisfying way, while foreshadowing the next one and leaving room for a respite and a sense of achievement.  Gameplay wise, this game sports both open-world (opened up gradually in the first 5 hours) and meaningful character customizations (able to be re-speced at any time) through assemblies of clockworks and gem-socketing (thus comply to its Steampunk theme). Enemies are varied and requires certain tactical thinking in the manners of both character positioning in the battlefield and strength/vulnerabilities of each enemy type. Character progression is also non-linear, meaning there's no hard coded class definition, so you can have detailed customization of each character's role, while everyone still has their unique specialties.  Aesthetically this is one of the more pleasing JRPGs you'll ever come across. The graphics have been remade into HD and its aesthetic design definitely takes cue from both contemporary and mid-19th century old-world life, and the visual design does a great job taking care of every minute detail in 3D and the textures are excellent if you take into account of the fact that this game is made in the early 2000's.  The soundtracks have been one of my favorites and it certainly sounds like it 's heavily inspired by the work of Academy award winner Joe Hisaishi.  To conclude this review, I would absolutely recommend this game to all RPG enthusiasts, even if you don't usually touch JRPG. When you do, make sure you endure through the first 3 or 4 hours of this game after which point the story really starts to pick up its pace.  Final verdict: first chapter of a deep and story-driven steampunk RPG trilogy, 9.5/10. ",

            "review_text": "Trails In The Sky is a JRPG from Falcom, a cult classic developer that's been churning out diverse and well crafted role playing games in a variety of styles (from action to strategy to dungeon crawling to metroidvania) since the Nes days. Joining all these games are equally diverse and gorgeous soundtracks from the developers in-house band/sound team.  Trails In The Sky's biggest twist on the jrpg formula is that it's actually well written...Falcom you madmen! How do you ever expect some crazy gimmicks like 'a good script', 'foreshadowing', 'plot twists', 'humor and whimsical moments that are actually funny', or 'character development' to ever catch on in the anime/game biz? Obviously this is why you guys are so obscure.  Oh yeah and the battle system is really fun too and both the story and gameplay are nicely paced, if you don't mind a ton of reading. But let's be honest, you're mainly playing this to see Estelle and Joshua grow and develop as characters along with their relationship.  The cute, sweet, funny, slice of life bits are honestly the best part too. So I'm happy it stays that way for about 40 hours, hahaha.  Go play it. Best Jrpg I've ever played. Can't wait to play the rest of the trilogy!",

If an RPG manages to get past those two milestones, then it's safe to say that I've become invested and am enjoying myself. The story is very good, despite a few cliches here and there. I feel like all the characters are unique, and more importantly, alive.   The progression of the story is also interesting, as it plays out more like a 'coming-of-age' story than what I'm used to from most games of the same genre. Estelle and Joshua travel across the country, remaining the only permanent members of the party. In each chapter, 2 characters are introduced and added to the party, and go their own ways at the end of the chapter. It's refreshing to follow Estelle and Joshua through the story as they grow into their own respective roles.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the best JRPG's I have ever played story/plot wise, combat is also particulary good but mainly I play this for the story rich enviorment it offers. I would recommend this to almost anyone who enjoys a good checker board JRPG but like any other game - depends entirely on the person who plays it.  Every character in the game has a special role, with each progress you make the game becomes more interesting to play, even the side/minor characters in other towns you will be visitting have always something new to say. But what got me the most of all into the game is the strong bond between the two main characters you'll be always playing (from start to end), not to mention the uncoverage of their hidden backstory throughout the progression of the game.  In other words, I think this game deserves an excellent grade in my book, there is also a sequel to this game which I will be definitely playing and if you ever decide to play the first one, then I think you won't regret playing the second one either.",

            "review_text": "This game is just simply amazing. If you enjoy long and adventurous RPGs, not to mention JRPGs, then you've come to the right place!   The plot itself is excellent. It reflects the struggles people can experience, the pain of losing what you consider dear, and the heartwarming friendship of those around you. Estelle Bright, the main female protagonist, discovers herself stumbling upon a path to a long and winding journey with the main male protagonist, Joshua Bright. She doesn't know what to expect, but she prepares herself both mentally and physically for the challenges up ahead. Sounds a bit cliched, perhaps? But if the journey begins with an odd pair consisting of a whiny, child-like teenage girl and a smart, awkward teenage boy, who both have an unbelievable amount of potential, you start wanting to follow along to see how their future turns out.  In addition to the main plot, which was fantastically written, there is a multitude of sidequests that each have their own unique effect on the gameplay. You don't just quickly rush through the events and understand the story. You take your time with each event, paying close attention to every detail, and not only understanding the story, but feeling it and living within it. And you are able to do all of this because characters of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is capable of pulling you into their own world.  The connections and relationships between characters are rather interesting, and you easily feel the need to know how these connections develop over time. Each character has their own wonderful background, full of mysteries that are yet to be uncovered and investigated. There is so much to learn about them and there is so much left unsaid. Their personalities are quite the attention grabber as well!  And while wandering around and exploring to your heart's content is enjoyable, the battles are also extremely exhilarating and always keep you on edge. There is never a time when you can sit back and relax during a battle. This is because it is not always easy to defeat the monsters or the opponents, and this is a good thing. Why? If something was easy-peasy, it would be expected to get boring after a period of time. These battles are battles that you must endure and help your main characters fight through successfully. They provide some difficulty, and though it can be frustrating at some points, it really does keep you going back for more.  To top off this tall stack of excitement, the soundtrack, artwork, and design are simply impeccable. The music accompanies the beautiful scenery of the game. I always found myself being awed by it all; it never failed to amaze me.   All in all, this is a fantastic game. I certainly do not regret purchasing it at all, and I always find myself being tempted to replay it over again. So, is this something you should buy? Definitely! You have my vote!",

I guarantee if you make it to the end and finish this game, you will purchase the sequel within minutes once the credits start rolling.  This game is also great for completionists. There's tons of things you can miss if you aren't paying attention. Quests, treasures, etc.  Do not buy this game if you can't handle large amounts of voiceless dialogue.

Your characters are junior members in basically an international NGO! You have run-ins with the national military! Rabbelrouse with foreigners!  This game's just fantastic. Only thing that isn't the greatest ever is the battle system, but it's serviceable, if a bit finicky. Tinkering with orbments to try and ease out the spells you want is a neat little problem solving challenge, if you want to get that into it.  But seriously, get this game.

The characters are really well done. All of them are really usefull in battles too its just up to your preference.Even the NPC's are really well done they always have something new to say. Hell some of the generic NPC's are better than most Rpg characters I have seen in my life.  I DO have 1 problem with the game though. The final boss has REALLY high physical defence. Even if you increase your strenght you can't do that much dmg on him withouth using an S-Craft. This makes getting one of the achivements really annoying. He also has great magical defence too.Also I pretty much tried every status aliments on him and nothing works. Even the super boss of this game is affected by some of the status aliments ( then again the super boss is dificult for other reasons).

            "review_text": "First time I played this was back in 2011 on my trusty PSP which now lies somewhere because I have no idea why. And boy, that was an experience. Being a hardcore fanboy of RPG and especially those from Japan (because I'm a giant fat weeaboo) and played games like the original Legend of Heroes, Ys, Generation of Chaos, Persona/Shin Megami Tensei and whatnot I was very quick to pick this up from my local Gamestop back in California. I think that was the best 20 bucks I spent during that semester.  Trails in the Sky is a spinoff/sidestory, or if you would like to call it the sixth game in the Legend of Heroes franschise. It's your typical turn-based JRPG with a little twist and a bit of strategy to it. Battle doesn't become too dull thanks to that and because of the 'Arts' system you can customize your characters (which are quite the amount) for a specific role whenever you want to. And it is paramount for the important battles. Unless you are playing on easy. Which you shouldn't do anyway. Shame on you if you do. Like, seriously.  But then, a lot of peope play RPGs for a good storyline which Trails in the Sky does not falter at. More the opposite; albeit that it has a problem of pacing. Now, the game is divided into chapters (I actually forget how many) but the game doesn't start to pick up about halfway through and for many that can be a turnoff. But to compromise this there are a lot of other things one can do. Sidestories, extra missions, exploration. The world of Trails in the Sky is vast and extremely beautiful which is one of its selling point. It's extremely well detailed and the characters just compliments this so well. Compared to a lot of other JRPGn out here on Steam the characters are actually interesting (*cough* Agarest *cough*) Seriously, of a cast of 35 party members in Agarest only three of them were actually somewhat interesting. Now, Trails in the Sky doesn't really have THAT huge of a cast but that doesn't matter when the majority of the characters are great. But of course, it's Japan so we have some sort of stereotypical characters which you will always see. *sighs*  But those minor flaws just pales in comparison of the whole greatness of the game. It's a rich and engaging world with some actually great music (I actually have the CD with the OST, suck it ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es!) that fits the vivid world and enhances the experience. Battle is somewhat fluid, characters actually have an interesting personality (for most part) and has an amazing story... if you can get past the first two chapters (but hey, the story isn't actually bad even from the beginning).  The experience from playing it on a PSP was great but I don't think I could experience the details from that small ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• screen the same way I can do on a PC. I mean, holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. The difference is amazing and I can finally enjoy both the artwork and the surroundings to its fullest potential. Only downside is that I feel like a neanderthal sitting in front of my computer and playing games with a controller. With both hands close to the crotch with the vibrating controller, I could do something else. Ya'now.  9/10. 'Anime was a mistake' - Hayao Miyazaki  but this game wasn't",

Nothing too major, just a trope/cliche that I'm not particularly fond of, and one that I think is overdone/done poorly a lot. Still, considering this is just part of a series, I'm not too bothered by it; if this game is any indication, the rest of the series will more than make up for it.  Nothing that you haven't seen before (not surprising considering it's age) but I don't think it's much of an exageration to call this a masterpiece. Everything seems to be gracefully woven together, with attention to detail where it matters. The characters are likeable, if a bit generic in some instances, but they play together nicely. The world building is fantastic, each NPC having several different bits of dialogue depending on where you are in the main story. Lots of locales, lots of friends. Even bits that would be jarring on their own are supported so well by the rest of the game that it makes sense.  Plus, it does one of my absolute favorite things a video game can do, ever! I don't understand why developers can't figure out that the climax is so much more interesting if it draws from all your actions leading up to that point. It's honestly rare, and probably worth playing for that reason alone.  (On that note, if anyone is interested in getting into game development, definitely give this one a study. The execution is mostly flawless, even if not all of the pieces are perfect.)  9.9 out of 10, lmao",

In the end most (but pretty much all the important) questions are answered and the ending leads straight into the plot of Second Chapter. But then you replay the game and suddenly all the pointless dialogue was actually foreshadowing the whole time.  Also this game can really break your balls, even on Normal (the easiest difficulty).

Because I want to pick up on all the plot hints I missed and the side quests I appereantly missed. &gt;.&lt;  It's fun, the combat system is simple and reasonably fun (I love turn based games). I'll admit that it's not one of those games who's battle systems made me want to grind, but I didn't mind sitting running around fighting all the monsters that I came across.  I love how this game doesn't give most of the characters backstories. They hint at them and then continue on. I like how it was natural in the story for these people to team up. A lot of times it's kind of like 'Meet random talented person. Get involved helping random person. Solve their problem. They join you for rest of game.' Characters leave group when it's natural and join hen it's natural.  Overall, a good game! Definetly worth a play if you want an actual story, a JRPG, or turn-based game.",

It has a great memorable story the characters are well designed. Some things I really enjoyed about this was at no point did I have to grind out levels (assuming you don't run from fights) so you are always moving forward, there is a ton of depth to this game but it has a very good pace so you are always moving forward you don't or at least for myself never felt like I was stuck having to spend hours on some small side quest that was boring and lose interest and that does happen in some games I believe I did all of the sides I only did one play though I found the side quests added to the story a lot of course I missed a lot too for items like there Ultimate's and probably some other chests.  I am 30 and been playing RPG's since I was around 6 back on the NES then SNES so I have played many RPG's since I was a child. Anyhow it is a very well done game, I would defiantly recommend this to anybody who wants a large engaging game with a great memorable story. You are able to customize a bit but I wont go into detail you will have to play it for yourself and find out as for myself I would like a bit more options for that but in no way was it something that held the game back. Hopefully If I can ever come up with some extra coin I will try the second chapter of this game to continue the story and if it is anything like this game It will be a joy to play. Anyway if you are looking for a solid Single player RPG this one is definitely something to pick up and give a try of course everybody is different with individual expectations of what a RPG should encompass but as for myself this has made it onto my personal top 10 list I cannot wait to continue the journey in the second chapter. -Nik",

I don¬¥t really know, what happened after that point - but to me it somehow seems, modern games in this genre have lost something. Something, I¬¥m somehow unable to name - for the time to come, lets refer to it as 'Charme'. Visuals made a really big step forward, but somehow that little special something, which makes a game unique got lost on the way. I didn¬¥t like the last 2-3 Final Fantasy Games, neither could I enjoy Dragon Age Inquisition. For me, the genre was kind of dead.  Until last summer. I stumbled upon Trails in the Sky. I¬¥ve heard of the game before, but I only knew it was originally a PSP Game with ... well lets say decent critcs. As a huge fan of JRPGs I thought 'okay, 15 Euros - you can¬¥t make much wrong at that price' After that I have to admit, I sort of forgot about the game since I had to work abroad for almost half a year.  In my winter holidays, I finally found the time to tackle the game.   It sort of left me back stunned. I finished the game in about 50 hours, In three days, in one go. I dont even remember the last game, which managed it to make me to this. I won¬¥t praise Trails to the skies, (pun not intended) it has enough flaws in my opinion. I mean the story in the first installment is ... well somewhat predictable if you ask me and I don¬¥t consider it very original, but it somehow breathes that certain atmosphere or charme I talked already about. The protagonists, as well as the rest of the main cast, are incredible likeable and you simply want to know, whats happening next. So, all I can actually say is - buy it, support the developers and simply enjoy it.  Id like to tip my head to XSeed, for bringing us such a gem. All I can do now, is to wait for the second part and hope I won¬¥t have to wait for to long. But nevertheless, SC is already on my 'buy on sight' list",

It didn't give that feeling of bland lifelessness that many newer games do with their worlds that may be populated with many people, but they all say the same thing or are just simply filler objects with no dialogue whatsoever. To put it simply, I found that I cared about the characters and that is something that is missing from the writing of so many games today.  The story was engaging and filled with humour and suspense that has you pondering the various mysteries that are introduced throughout the plot and are resolved in a way that left me feeling both satisfied and ready to grab the next chapter in the series.   The music wasn't heavely varied but was well placed and helped establish the atmosphere of the many locations you will visit with a few tunes being memorable.  The battle system was fun and allowed for a variety of tactics without getting too bogged down in overcomplicated game mechanics. The battles where fun and seemed to be designed in such a way as to offer a bit of challange without putting the player through the annoyance of having to constantly retry because you weren't using a tactic that was designed for that particular fight. (I'm looking at you FFXIII &gt;:|)  Overall, the game was a long adventure that was filled with wonderful characters that I enjoyed and left me with pleasant memories.

It's a very enjoyable old school tactical turn-based RPG. You do not customize your character stats, but you do get to pick equipment and what magics to equip --- you don't, however, pick your clothing or anything like that. You can go and grind to get more XP and items to craft your magic ability, or you can just go at it head on.   I've played some games where setting up your 'formation' in tactical turn-based game was useless, but I've found it really can make a difference against higher level or higher-number opponents.  The game is a bit lightweight in the customizing department, so I would label this as a 'simple RPG' or an 'easy to pick up RPG'.   Graphics are not bad. Sound is not bad.

            "review_text": "Synopsis: With an unbelievably detailed world, a great soundtrack throughout, and a beautifully detailed story (and characters) Trails in the Sky is one of the best JRPG series available to date. The first game in the Trails series (a trilogy, currently with game 2 in the series predicted to get it's US launch in 2015) introduces us to the heroes of our story, Joshua Bright and Estelle Bright. The game, with between 70-90 hours worth of gameplay, follows the story of our heroes as they set out from their hometown in their quest to become full-fledged members of their guild, the Bracers. Over the course of their journey we're able to watch as both Joshua and Estelle grow and meet a number of other individuals who aid them in their quest to bring peace and resolution to the rising turmoil in their home country of Liberl.  While I could ramble on and on with a wall of text, I think that this is a fair synopsis of the story, and as such will proceed to the pros and cons of this game.  Pros: Up to 8 playable party members, each with a fully developed backstory that's revealed as the game progresses  Great voice acting (even in English!) really sets this game apart from numerous other RPG games  Graphics fit well with the genre and themes of the game and are complimented well by the game's music, though they are clearly not the most modern graphics available  Rich story-driven game experience, something every JRPG fan will be able to love and appreciate  'Quartz' system allows for characters to be dynamically built to fit almost any role they're needed for  Detailed dialogue with both NPCs and [empty] Chests builds a more immersive game world for the player to explore  Large, flowing game world that feels neither to linear or too small for the grandeur of the story  Guild questing system offers a prevalent, immersive side-questing feature to the game  Cons:  Part 1/3 in the Trails series, while not truly a 'con' per-se only part 2/3 has been confirmed for release in the US (allegedly via Steam) in 2015 despite all 3 parts having been released overseas already, if part 3 never makes it stateside fans of the series will have to seek out a 'fanlated' download for the 3rd installment as all 3 parts combine into a single complete story (yes, each sequel is a DIRECT sequel, picking up right where the previous game left off)  Preemptive strike can be finicky at times, registering a monster's facing as having changed up to 2-3 noticeable seconds before the on-screen model responds to the change   Backtracking, LOTS of backtracking, I can't stress enough how much backtracking there is in this game  And following right along with backtracking, monster spawns have no variation or randomization to them, instead each monster model will always result in a fight with the same type/amount of enemies each time you engage it, which leads fight to grow repetitive over the duration of a chapter  Expensive quartz crafting system makes optimizing characters costly and time consuming  Final Evaluation: Truly, this is one of the best JRPGs that I have played in ages, and it's easily my favorite start to any series since Tales of Symphonia got its US port. So what can I say? The pros here speak for themselves, this is a game deeply entrenched in the ideas of good storytelling first-and foremost and it serves this game well (as it serves any quality RPG well), especially with how well the voice actors were chosen for the US port of this game. Plus, after so long with the Arts system used in the Tales series the Quartz mechanic was also a nice fresh breather from what had become oh-so-familiar. The cons are more of a hit-or-miss experience wise, and for the sake of my final evaluation I'll overlook the obvious glaring issues with this game being [part] 1/3 in a series where the ending may never even see the light of day (officially) in the US. The quartz system's costs and the monster spawns depend on you personally. I didn't mind the quartz format since I never ran from combat, but never running led to numerous boring fights that really made me 'feel the grind'... so to speak. Again, for me, the backtracking didn't bother me as it typically comes with the JRPG territory but for others this can be a big turn off, especially with all the side quests this game features.   The Final Take:  Graphics - 8/10 These graphics really fit the game well. Clearly a step up from the traditional JRPG turn-based combat system but falls a bit short by failing to go all-the-way and implementing real-time combat and appropriate AI.  Audio - 10/10  A beautiful soundtrack that is used well throughout the entire game to truly maximize the emotions any given scene is trying to evoke in the player. Perfect.  Gameplay - 7/10 Gameplay can be hindered, at times, by the lack of 360-degree control. This is especially noticed during travel between places and attempting to engage from behind enemies. The preemptive strike mechanic also seems to be somewhat glitchy and it would be remise of me to not take these flaws into account when thinking about the game's overall gameplay. Otherwise, it's a solid, all-around JRPG... though I do wish there were a bit more player control on the battle map.  Game World - 10/10 An amazing game world with a very detailed society and social structure. Coupled with the flawless execution of cross-border politics and the promise of other countries opening up to the player in the remainder of the series makes this a land no JRPG fan will be able to resist exploring.  Story - 9/10 A very well executed story. Clich√© at times, predictable at others, and a bit underwhelming in the climax due to the carry over into the rest of the series. The characters develop well over the course of the game though and all of the characters are very likable. With well written dialogue and a story that operates smoothly on a national scale it's a thoroughly enjoyable experience.   Difficulty - 6/10 Hmm... this one's a bit difficult. Leveling is almost unnecessary through most of the game, you'll do just fine just fighting what you happen to run into by chance. Until act 4. Once you reach the final act enemies are MUCH more durable and dish out FAR more punishment. Dungeons in act 4 serve to power level characters to the level the game wants them at (which in my case was a 10 level bump into the 30s from the 20s).   Final Score - 8/10 A very well done JRPG with solid overall presentation throughout. Beautiful music, quality writing, and genuinely likable characters transformed what could have been a passable story into a truly memorable experience. If you don't like turn based combat or the JRPG genre then this game might not be the right game for you but for those of you who like an expansive, immersive JRPG story this is a must own series.

            "review_text": "SHORT VERSION: If you like games with well-crafted lore and setting, lovable characters and excellent attention to detail as well as world-building, this game is definitely for you. While it may start out slow, it's because it takes it's time to build up, and in the end it will be all worth it.  ________________________________________________________________________________  Have you ever felt nostalgia for something that you haven't played yet? This was what I felt when I started playing Trails in the Sky. Made by Falcom back in 2005, Trails in the Sky tells the story of a plucky young tomboy named Estelle, and her adopted brother Joshua, as they take on the role of junior members of the Bracer Guild, a group that undertakes tasks and requests to protect civilians and maintain the stability of their country, the Liberl Kingdom.  The story itself is very well presented, and is really something that modern JRPGs lack. The characters themselves are likable, with humorous banter, good one-liners and engaging dialogue when push comes to shove. The amount of foreshadowing is insane, having the subtlest detail early on in the story developing and playing a huge role later on. While it starts out fairly tame, with a bit of a slice-of-life atmosphere as you take on various sidequests from the Bracer Guild, it slowly becomes evident that something is happening within the kingdom, as numerous incidence and weird coincidences occur starting from an airship hi-jacking, which escalates into a full-scale conspiracy. The feel itself is reminiscent of late 90s to early 00s JRPGs like Suikoden and Xenogears, as the developers themselves wrote the story for years before they could even make it into the game, making sure that no plotholes or sudden asspulls happen in the story. There is focus on world building too, as there are various notes and NPCs in the game that shed some light into the history of the Liberl Kingdom, from political structure, history of the royal family, political events and relations with its neighboring countries, as well as regional customs. This can also be seen in reading the Liberl News issues, an in-game newspaper that can be bought and will not only shed light on recent major events that your characters have partaken in, but also show off backgrounds of places and traditions in the kingdom.  The gameplay involves traditional turn based JRPG action with a bit of tactical movement thrown in with the use of movements in grids and heavy emphasis on turn order manipulation. Its a relatively simple formula, but becomes interesting as you gain more skills that work with turn order. Unlike most JRPGs before, status effects are actually good in this game and is key to making short of hard to kill enemies and/or bosses. The skill system has a bit of depth in it, promoting mixing and testing different combinations of gems (or Quartz in this game) that results in different skills.  Exploration is open-ended. While the game doesn't have a full world map and eschews for interconnected highways and roads like Final Fantasy X, the game encourages players to explore areas that are available to the from the get-go, which rewards players with good equipment, good leveling spots and sidequests. Sidequests in this game are entertaining, as they're not just fetch quests or eliminating X numbers of monsters, but rather involve bit of investigation and decision making for full reward. This, coupled with the characters throwing witty dialogue makes sidequests fun to do and not feel soulless or seem like padding.  As with all Falcom games, Trails in the Sky excels in the music department. The musical score ranges from a jazzy battle theme and upbeat field music, to relaxing seaside themes and orchestra. The selection makes every scene count and fits right in whether it be a sentimental one or while traversing along the highroads. Just the opening theme itself gives the player of what to expect from the game, starting slow and steady and slowly making its way to an epic orchestra.  As far as it goes, Trails in the Sky is one of those games that I really really want to promote, its a very under appreciated and niche gem, made with a lot of heart as well as attention to detail and good story telling. With a good amount of drama, mixed with political intrigue and with a dash of humor, Trails in the Sky is a game that harkens back to the days of quality JRPGs.",

So, for quick review :  + Good story (this is important) + Fluid control, either with controller or keyboard and mouse + High resolution with good 3D + Pretty good voice acting  - The texture kinda low at higher resolution. It's looks good on low-res display like PSP, or if you play it on TV. But on PC, usually people are barely one meter from monitor, sadly the texture looks blur. - This is subjective, but I do hope this has dual voice. Yes, I am aware with the lisencing issue. The English voice is good, but I still prefer the original voice  especially Tita .  Foods for thought :   This is only the first part of a trilogy (Second Chapter and The Third), and so far, only First Chapter (this one) get translated. I really hope they'll release the english version for both SC and Third. Or else, you are stuck... like me ;_;.   Based of what graphic card you have, you can override the setting from your graphic card control panel, so you can maximize the graphic. I have maximized the anti-aliasing, and now the 3D looks really smooth.   So yeah, I recommended this game. Get it.",

            "review_text": "This game is fantastic! The characters are memorable, late game strategy is fairly complex and there's no lack of challenge at higher levels. I love the story, and I can't wait for the next installments. If you enjoyed Xenosaga/Xenogears or some of the earlier final fantasy installments you're going to love this game.   Best features:  - Characters all play very differently. The story gives you plenty of time to learn each character's strengths and weaknesses, and while you cannot control your party until the end of the game (for truly legitimate storyline reasons), once you have that control you can put together some really interesting dynamics for the end game. Teamwork is important, and many characters have skills that allow them to function in multiple roles without breaking away from their overall archetype.  - Deep and engaging storyline. For a first chapter I'm really excited to see what happens next. The initial story is fairly self contained, but the characters are developed just enough to give them true depth without revealing everything about them. It seems clear that the next installments will expand on each character, and I honestly can't wait to see it. The bad guys are developed in a similar manner as well, and there are already indications that some of them will be returning in the sequels. Character motivations are unambiguous (except for when they need to be), and personal conflicts are well defined.  - Unique skills are awesome! Individual character skills are highly accessible, very powerful when used properly, and thematic to each character. A full party can shift gears from offense to defense at just about any time with these skills, and the enemies are vicious enough to reward both aggressive and conservative playstyles when necessary.  - Very Limited level grinding. XP received is based on your character level. If you're below level for an area you will gain levels very quickly. If you're overpowered for an area you will gain levels extremely slowly. As such, you will quickly rise to the appropriate level for a given area until it's time to move on.   Areas that need improvement:  - Itemization is dull. There are only a few game changing pieces of equipment. Most are just currency sinks that keep you in line with the enemies' power curve. In most cases characters will upgrade automatically (aside from the two main characters). It would've been nice to see more variety in the gear.  - You can miss out on sidequests. If you're not careful you'll bypass a lot of hidden quests, or if you advance the story line too quickly you'll lose access to some quests forever. There's no real reason for this other than 'time constraints.' The only benefit of this system is that you can't really overpower the sidequests, but for completionists it's a pain.  - Magic feels underpowered. For the most part you won't really need to use magic aside from healing. At low levels you don't really have enough MP to build a dedicated mage, and at higher levels it's difficult to stack quartz in a way that really maximizes the power of magic since the quartz that boosts magic damage is blue, and blue is primarily for healing magics that heal for a fixed amount and are not based on your magic stat. Since you need to stack the same color to gain access to the most powerful spells, the system seems to work against itself as a result. Magic is used in a few very specific circumstances, but any character can do the job for the most part.   Overall: 9.5/10. The games flaws are minor and nitpicky. It's strengths are glorious. This game is worth every cent.",

            "review_text": "I am not really a JRPG person. Does Fire Emblem Awakening count as a JRPG? If it doesn't, I believe the most recent one I played is Phantasy Star IV on an emulator. Other than that, I've primarily been acquainted with WRPGs.  But this game is great.   As of the time I write this, It strikes a delicate balance between modern and classic RPGs. In terms of being player friendly, it is neither hand-holding or frustratingly cryptic. The graphics are outdated but pleasant, a good mesh of 3D and 2D and character portraits with a wide range of expressions (something I always appreciated since FE). The battle system calls for no mastery of strategy, but it's always satisfying to nuke a horde of enemies with a big fat AoE.  So far I spoke only of how this game might be acceptable. Why do I like it so much? The story, my dear boy, the story.  By story, I mean everything from the background of the world, to characterization, the plot, and how it's all presented. The steampunk-ish world where there are monarchs, airships, and magic goes between almost idyllic and gut-wrenching (in a good way) as events unfold. All the NPCs you meet have their own lives, and although it may be just a few lines, they change over the course of a chapter so you can see how their stories progress. The plot constantly piques your curiosity, but is not overbearing and feels natural, thanks to the focus on the main characters meshing beautifully with the standard secret conspiracy/shocking reveal fare of JRPGs. You'll grow to like them and care about them, and see things unfold from their perspective. Witty dialogue from a hardworking localization team certainly helps as well. In retrospect, you might be able to play 'spot the cliches', but the game manages to make it immersive and engaging.  Oh, and the music's great too. More focus on chill than epic, but that's how the game rolls.  So I think you should buy this game, worth full price, and if you're too poor for that do buy it when it's on sale.",

The main story itself is simple and has been seen quite a lot already.However, it is the entire cast of characters who make it such an enjoyment to fulfill the role of a couple of young bracers in the Kingdom of Liberl. Estelle and Joshua, the two main characters, works very well together. And that complicity,until the very end of FC, with each chapter introducing new characters to team up with, each playing an important part in the whole story, will bring you a great deal of good emotions ! But that's not all, FC standing for First Chapter, there is of course a second chapter coming, and it seems FC is just a prelude to emotionally prepare the player for the last minutes of the game and what is to come in SC. You'll have to play the game to understand.  While FC truly shine thanks to its characters and their story, it is still a rpg, meaning a combat system. It is classic but quite good, thought some combats are a bit long and leveling is needed from time to time. The item and magic system ifsa bit unusual and feel underused. It is still rather simple an easy to use, but be aware of you spending, because you can quickly run out of money if you don't farm a bit.  Add to all that the technical part, lovely visuals, graphims, cute chara design, and a great soundtrack. Yes it is now one of my favorite rpg.  So in a few months hopefully; the second chapter of Trail in the Sky should be released, which is supposed to complete the main story. Feeling heartbroken by the end of FC, considering its ending, such a cliffhanger and all that has been left unexplored.

The localization is incredibly witty and the story does a great job of stringing you along with a nice organic plot that isn't some 'you're the hero' cliche. The game does use plenty of tropes, but the writing keeps them feeling fresh all the way through.   It has turn-based combat, with a bit of positioning involvement. And the CP system is a pretty neat way of making you choose whether to save your points for massive attacks or use them on smaller special attacks, when the big attacks would just be overkill. Also, every character has a decent amount of customization of their spells and whatnot through the orb system.  The PC version so far has some pretty glaring bugs, but looking at the Hub page, the developers seem to be updating to fix them as quickly as possible.   This game, also, is merely the first part of an overarching story, and ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.

The story is fairly slow paced. If you like that is a matter of opinion. The battle and magic system is pretty cool. Every NPC says it's own text which changes after each event. Even item chests have their own custom dialog if you examine them after looting them. My issue with the game is the ending. Oh boy what an ending. I played this game for 42 hours for *that* ending.

However, I still decided to give The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky a try and I was impressed how much fun I've had in the short amount of time I've played. Trails brings back the old-school feel of console RPGs, while still embracing new game mechanics. The combat system, although simplistic, still carries a touch of complex customization to keep players interested.   The story and the characters are instantly likeable, funny and charming in their overdramatic dialouge. For someone who grew up on Final Fantasy, the Tales series and who's first console RPG was Lunar, Trail's handling of characters sure brings back memories, while making new ones. But this review isn't carried solely on nostalgia. Trails stands on its own. The combat is smooth, even on an older laptop as mine and the framerate hasn't even been an issue. Playing it with a USB controller was instantly recognized, without any issue on my part to set buttons. Although I've yet to clock in ant double digit hours, I've throughly enjoyed everything about this game.   I hope STEAM recognizes the flood of positive reviews for this game and works double-time to bring more JRPGs of this nature to us. If so, I'll buy it. For us older gamers, it's a nice break from the dark and gloomy RPGs, and to sit back, laugh and have fun in this light-hearted adventure.",

(it has happened to me in some games) Each turn has specific turn bonuses, (anything from standard crits to healing and strenght boosts) and if you play correctly, you can steal them from your enemies with a special attack (I forget what they are actually called) that allows a character to attack the next turn instead of the person who would normally take that turn, or a skill that has a short cooldown/cast time. Used correctly, they can make boss fights much easier, but still worthy of the name  BOSS . The story is also well done, and it always left me wanting to know what would happen next. It did become a bit of a grind in the last zone for me, (a huge maze that you can quickly loose yourself in) and it took me a few months before I decided to finish it, but I now regret not finishing it sooner. It has great world design, and even though the graphics aren't the best, they could draw out some beautiful scenery.   I have played many different RPG's, and this was one of the best. 9/10  The reason it isn't 10/10 is because their is almost no loot. Money is mainly earned from questing, and all gear is either purchased or found in chests. I am someone who would much rather get great items from killing enemies than grinding to buy something at the store. Now that I think about it, though, this may have been done for world building reasons.  Going back to combat, the skill system in this game was unlike any other I had seen. Each character has a device called an  Orbment , and by inserting special gems (quartz) into them, their element changes and grants the character new skills. Systems like this may have been used in other games, but this is the first one I've played that has used it. I realize I gave my rating above, and it is usually done last, but I am too lazy to move it.",

I prefer turn based games versus the more popular real time fighting styles, which makes it rather tricky to find a game that I like for pc, as I don't have a different gaming console.  This game is much better than I thought it would be. I hadn't heard of it before, so didn't know its anime, or PSP renditions going in. The game is much more complicated than I anticipated (the prologue was a little confusing for me with the orbs, quartz, etc, when I was just reading through the explanations), but it quickly fell into place and was pretty straight forward. The heroine is a little annoying at times, but she is a sheltered, headstrong 16-year-old, and the other characters call her on it, and she is an interesting foil to Joshua, the male lead. As the game progresses, her behavior matures a bit, which is rather astonishing to have character development in a game like this. My only complaint about this game is to do with the conversations. THere are A LOT, and you can hold down a key to try and speed through the speech bubbles, but that doesn't help much. It gets annoying very fast, and very tedious, especially since there isn't a way to exit out of a conversation, and EVERY NPC has dialogue. In its sequels, I hope this is changed. Some chapters have so much dialogue, you have to take frequent breaks to not get frustrated (at least, I did).  The game has replayability factor, is incredibly detailed, and the vernacular is great! There are allusions to sexuality, but it is not blatant, no boob armor, and the humor isn't overdone. It really is a very good game. I am tempted to get a console to play its sequels that have been released already in other mediums.",

Inside said mine you get to ride in a minecart, the minecart takes you to a dead end where you have to talk to a chap in order to learn to flip a lever, only I'm fairly certain I clicked that lever before going into the minecart but whatever, so then you go back, flip the lever, arrive at the elevator only to find out that the elevator needs a key. Go back to the starting point, go back to the dead end, talk to the chap again, learn that the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• knew about the elevator key yet neglected to mention it, get key, backtrack and finally go to the damn elevator!   Now, this sounds like a fairly standard introduction to a boring rpg puzzle right? That's what I thought, yet on the next level of the mines, there are no minecart puzzles, let alone any minecarts, only a straightforward path. The whole section with the minecart was just a timesink to pad a lacking game. And pretty much every single side quest is like this too.  And the difficulty level, now don't read this as something good, higher difficulty in this game does NOT mean, use strategies to prevail. No. The enemies just gets buffed way above their level, to the point where two hits will drain your life bar, and there's usually around 3-5 enemies in any given fight. You cannot play around this. Even on the lowest difficulty, grinding is unavoidable. Don't even bother choosing anything other than normal, it just increases the amount of grinding needed. I did, and I had to go back and suffer through the whole intro and yap yap yap non-stop dialogue one more time.  Usually in rpgs you can avoid the vendor junk and hold out for the good loot in dungeons and secret chests. Not so here. There's no looting in town, I mean none. No secrets, plenty of dead ends though, but nothing, NOTHING, to justify such exploration. Really strange. And the loot found in dungeons are really, REALLY, sparse as well. So you grind to be able to buy the junk from the vendors, just so you can reach the next area, where your gear isn't so hot anymore anyways.

The game feels like a B anime show, with mountains of unnecessary dialogue and attempts at humor that never really hit the mark. Character development feels very forced, and usually devolves to one character listing off their personality traits in a conversation.  Most of your time with the game will be spent moving from town to town, solving problems that have only a passing link to the primary conflict. The storyline quests that the characters pursue have little to no bearing on the actual plot. In short, the game is mostly filler material, with plot development only occuring in the first and last few hours.  The combat system isn't bad, but does drag on in certain fights. Animations can't be skipped in any way, so when battling groups of enemies the fights tend to drag on. The monsters you will encounter have no coherency with the locales of the world, and aren't threatening in the slightest. Most of the game is spent fighting squirrels, sheep, and bugs. The game's inhabitants are terrified of these creatures.  If you're a big fan of JRPG tropes, stereotypes, and story beats, this might be what you're looking for.

Of that 37 hours I've spent maybe 3 hours actually fighting monsters. Literally 4 hours tops...Including grinding and all the side quests. (which are no more than walk to an area. find an item or enemy and bring back or kill) there is not any real surprise or any life to the game. just endless walking. the map direction is the worst because the screen can swivel and when you bring up the mini map it looks like you have to go north when in fact north might be walking south on your screen. Stupid and confusing at times. there are a few decent boss fights. (3 challenging ones so far) but for 37 hours of game play the anti climactic tone of the whole game is getting annoying. The end of chapter 2 there is no final fight. just hours of dialogue that is very badly written and one can only hope to button mash 'B' to end the suffering. I'll play on and finish the game but unless there are awsome boss battles and many more enemy fights it will be a disappointment. Im not sure why everyone seems to like the game.

The only mini game is fishing and you dont get to partake in that till over half way through and its not very fun. the leveling system is there but you dont choose any perks when you level... you just hear a 'Ding' sound and your hero grow a little stronger.

Combat is turn based with minor tactical elements. Fairly simple and rarely difficult. The only real uniqueness comes from picking your passives/spells and there is an in game manual that explains it well.   Story:  Usually easy going and lighthearted.   Conclusion:  Although the gameplay is very dated, I enjoyed this one. At no point while playing did I want to stop, but after 60+hrs ill need a break before steam releases the second chapter.",

Originally, I had a rant here about erratic difficulty, but I think I overexaggerated it a bit. There is still difference in difficulty between sidequests and story progression and sometimes required battles are quite difficult. My problem is that I forgot items even existed. Once I stocked up on items and started really using them, the difficulty dropped from impossible to challenging but manageable. Learn from my mistakes, readers: stock up on items and use them. You're gonna need them, especially once you hit Chapter 3. The retry offset function is there as well if you need it.

Gathering Quests and Hunting Quests have little stories behind them and have a degree of difficulty to them (you have to find them instead of the map showing you where they are)  The Main Characters have nuances and reasons for being 'Bracers' which I've only scratched the surface to currently. People who join the Main Characters have reasons for journeying that doesn't seem forced or contrived, with stories and histories of their own (again only scratching the surface as of now).  The cooking craft is helpful in multitude of ways and you really have to balance between your funds and your need to gather certain crystals that activate powers powers and open parts of your 'powers'.

Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (AKA Eiyuu Densetsu: Sora no Kiseki) is actually the sixth entry to a larger series which, itself, is the sixth entry to a much larger and older franchise created by Nihon Falcom, A wonderful little group of developers whom I, frankly, just can't shut up about.  In terms of story, gameplay, and graphics, Trails in the Sky FC (which is the official title) is the first title of the first trilogy arc in the entire Trails/Kiseki universe, with the second title and, hopefully, third title on its way here, in which all the characters, nations, politics, etc., are established. The gameplay resembles that of traditional RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, in which enemies are visible in the overworld, and at the same time, battles are very much like a simplistic version of RPGs, ala Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics. I should also note that a magic system is implamented very much like Final Fantasy VII's Materia system for complete character customization. As for the graphics, the engine was based on the graphics engine Falcom used on their previously released, and successful, PC game Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, which also served as the back bone, with many tweeks and enhancedments, for not only the majority of Trails titles but also for later Ys titles such as Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origins.  All in all, the gameplay and graphics will feel both old and new while the story will keep you on your toes with the anticipation of SC being released later this year, if all goes well.

This can sometimes be a bad thing when all you want to do is go explore. However the story is a good one and worth the read in my opinion.

            "review_text": "Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a game I bought last August right after it came out on Steam because I had some extra money and I generally like JRPGs. I didn't actually end up playing it until January 2015, and after finishing it I can't believe I didn't play it sooner.  As has been stated in other reviews, the world building in this game is great. I was sucked in pretty quickly and was fully invested from very early in the game until the end. The characters, while not all exactly unique, are very likeable and fleshed out. From all the supporting cast to the party members (and especially the two main characters), they're all memorable and have their own distinct personalities.  The combat system isn't groundbreaking but it's very solid and I liked it quite a bit. Think somewhere between Skies of Arcadia and Final Fantasy Tactics. You move around on a grid and your movement is limited, but your positioning very much matters, as line attacks or AoE attacks can hit multiple units on both sides. My only real complaint with the game (and it's a relatively small one at that) is that it's somewhat restrictive in where you can go. After you clear the first region for example, you move on to the next with no option to return. There's no real reason to ever go back even if you could, I just like being able to go anywhere in a game like this.  After finishing the game, I've been extremely eager to play the sequel which, barring another delay, should be out within a couple of months in English. If you like character and story focused games (and if you like JRPGs how could you not?) then you won't be disappointed with Trails in the Sky.",

            "review_text": "To start out with I'd like to mention that I'm a sucker for the Final Fantasy series, but have been pretty terrible at getting my act together to try out other acclaimed JRPGs. I didn't know about this game until it's Steam release was announced and people seemed to get pretty psyched about it online, so I figured I had to try this. More than half a year later I got my act together and have just now finished it. And holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. This is one of the best games I've played in years.  Is it a perfect game? No. First of all the combat system grew old and a little too repetetive on me quickly and there are pretty far between serious combat challenges. Mainly due to this, the game is fairly easy (there's a few really tough battles, but not that many).  I think my main concern with the combat is also due to the 'battlegrounds'. They look different, but throught the entire game they're essentially the same. It's a fixed square area where characters and enemies can move around. The nature is a little different depending on where in the game you are, but there are no obstacles or interactive objects on the battlegrounds whatsoever, which is a shame as that would have added an additional element to the combat.  That is pretty much my main gripe with the game, though. Well, that and the fact that it starts a bit slow, but I'm alright with that.  What really makes this game phenomenal is the story. It's not just good. It's really, really good. It has everything - romance, tragedy, political intrigues, humor, war, betrayal, and I could keep going. And it's not just implementing these themes - it's implementing them together very, very well. The characters are also well-written and have some pretty good interaction. They're different both in personality and in their role in the story. I never found that any of the main characters felt out of place or unnecessary, which is pretty impressive with a fairly large character roster.  There's also a ton of side stuff to do with varying difficulty. Standard monster-killing sidequests, take item from A to B-quests, escort quests, etc. Alongside all this, there's a lot of hidden stuff and collectibles, that are completely optional and a lot of it is pretty well-hidden. If you truly want a 100% completion then you have to extremely thorough and visit and revisit almost all areas - and you have to do it before progressing too far or some areas will be locked. Normally I hate this locked approach, but I actually find it works alright in this game, as there's always something new to do in whatever area you end up in next.  Completing the game took me just under 50 hours - and I tried to be thorough in finding most collectibles and items (and failed...). If you're not into all these extras I reckon the main game can be completed in less than 30 hours without rushing anything. If you're into JRPGs you should definitely not miss out on this title!   Be warned, though. Halfway through the game I learned that this is just the first of three chapters. It was originally released in 2004 and they're still not done with the localization of the second chapter, yet, so finishing the entire story is going to require some patience. Playing this game is still completely worth it, though!",

There's orbment (i.e. magic) system frustrated me a little - Much of it goes unexplained outside of an in-game manual, and it's quite cumbersome to keep flicking between the manual and the menus to figure out which combinations of orbments will gain you access to which spells. Around mid-game when I had access to most types of orbments, I slapped a 'good enough' config into my characters and then never had the incentive or desire to delve back into it other than to replace orbments with higher level ones.  Support and defensive orbments/abilities also seemed to be unnecessary throughout the entire game, other than in the final boss battle. It all just boiled down to damage, damage, damage...  What really kept me playing though were the game's story/writing, the music, and the attention to detail.   Unlike many JRPGs, the plot is engaging and coherent and the characters are interesting and relatable. It's all quite trope-heavy, so don't expect stunning levels of originality - but it's pulled off with enough charm and intrigue to keep you nicely entertained.  The music is catchy and pleasant - up there with Final Fantasy at times. Sound effects are pretty standard / nothing special. The attention to detail can be seen in the environments (particularly in the towns), enemies, dialog, etc... It feels like a lot of care has been put into the game.
