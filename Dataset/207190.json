            "review_text": "Fireburst is a competent racing game that doesn't really add anything new to the genre, but hey it's a racing game and for that reason alone it is probably of interest to racing or action minded gamers. The Steam Overlay and widescreen modes work, and controller support is included by default. Overall the game does not try to do anything new, the flame-on ability of your car essentially allowing insta-kill collisions doesn't really add anything exciting to the mix. However the level design is competent and there are a variety of characters and cars to choose from, and given the bargain price this game should be considered before purchasing a full price racing title. In summary, the game is slightly better than Post Apocalyptic Mayhem, but not quite as good as the Flatout series, so I recommend it only for the racing afficianado who has to have his hands on something new.",

            "review_text": "This game has the potential to be a great game but a few deficiencies result in it just being a quite good game. Each car has a fireboost power which speeds up your car and damages opponents however it generates heat which can cause your car to explode. Your car can be cooled down by driving through water which makes for great gameplay. Both the choice of driver and car affects the stats. The challenge mode introduces variations into the gameplay and is great fun however it is far too short. The other fly in the ointment is the splitscreen mode. In splitscreen mode there is just the two of you and no option to add AI drivers. So this game has great visuals, good sound track, great gameplay but is spoiled by a short single player mode and the lack of AI in splitscreen. I suspect the online multiplayer would be very good if you like playing with strangers on the net. Another oddity of this game is that reconfiguring the buttons requires you to edit a .ini file using a text editor.",
