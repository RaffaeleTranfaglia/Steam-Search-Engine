This game may not be pretty or super-polished, but it's got it where it counts. As the Pogo Athlete Steam Card says, you have to learn all the nuances of the controls to master the game, and it can be quite challenging.",

I am now questioning my sexuality. Great game!",

The main pogo stick mechanic is implemented very well, and I personally havn't plaid any game with movement like this. My favorite thing to do in the game is collect the bounce power-up, climb to the highest point in the level, and bounce as high as I can and turn on bounce mode (which retains your jump hieght) and bounce like a meniac to the end of the level.  The game's biggest weaknesses are the enemies, poor collisions, and one or two bad music tracks. The enemies provide no threat but at least you're not required to kill them (because combat is kinda boring) . Somtimes you'll hit the side of a platform and get suspended in air and then gradually slide off. And like I said there are a few really bad music tracks, but for the most part it's ok.  All in all, the platforming is fun and the game is cheap. I think it's worth a buy!",

Seriously though this game isn't a hidden gem, it has a crap load of issues. Akward controls mixed with first-person platforming? Check. Faulty level geometry collission and power-ups that have no pick-up hitbox meaning that you can't use them? Check. Bland visuals? Check. Royalty free, stock BGM that doesn't loop or transition properly? You betcha.  However despite all of these really blatant and intrusive flaws I managed to find enjoyment in this game. Something about beating a level with a jump that seems nigh-impossible because of how unreliable the collision and controls felt so massively satisfying. Like when I got stuck on a single level for probably an hour because of one jump that required precision timing and a passionate prayer to every god, goddess, and spiritual being known and unknown to mankind just to make, and then I made it, I felt like a champ. Only to die to the next jump.  Needless to say it made gave me something to do while I listened to podcasts. Best ~0.50 cent purchase ever.",
