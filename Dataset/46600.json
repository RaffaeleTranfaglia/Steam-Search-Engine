I bought it for it's gameplay, and still enjoy it for that and it's well done online laddering.  Not only are the controls solidly simple, but they also allow for quite a few physics based trickes to be pulled off. This results in gameplay that rarely gets dull and allows the player's playstyle to clearly show in multiplayer matches.",

The gameplay is fast but responsive and skillful, there isn't a moment where you feel cheated by the controls. There's not a flaw in this game and you could easily kill hours playing this. Would recommend.  It's also a perfect price to gift a friend after you learn the skills then kick their butt.. until they get better than you xD",

Once you found out how it works this is pretty fun and really addictive for a indie game.   One interesting part of the game is that there is an KI which learns from you. The aim is to train the KI to beat the enemy KI on maximum difficulty. Which gets rewarded with an achievment aswell...Wasnt able to do it, but I wish you luck.",
