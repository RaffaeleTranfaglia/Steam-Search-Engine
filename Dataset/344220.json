    "description": "Janky Tanks is a local multiplayer combat game for 1-8 players. It features hilarious physics and rapid &quot;janky&quot; combat. Seriously, your tank winds up spending most of its time in the air, using wall jumps and rocket jumps to fight. It's fun for the whole family. Try it. You won't be disappoint.",
