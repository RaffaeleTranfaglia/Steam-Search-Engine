This game is pretty hilarious and has lots of entertaining chatter as well as scenarios and it's own style.If you enjoy murdering zombies, hate boss like personas and want make a difference in your job , this is the game for you!",

I enjoyed it a fair amount but the $/hours ratio (5:2) struggles a bit compared to some titles if you aren't picking up the soundtrack. I put this in my 'buy at 50% sale' bucket.",

            "review_text": "One of those games that I'm not really sure about if I should recommend it or not. If there was some kind of neutral rating I would have picked that.   In Corporate Lifestyle Simulator you're goal is to kill as many of your fellow (zombie) colleagues and rescue some who have not turned yet. There are quite a few weapons and office supplies (which can be used as a weapon) for you to use, after a few levels you will have to battle some kind of boss which all have different attacks and skills.  Mindlessly killing hordes of pixelated zombie accountants with a stapler is pretty fun however, after a few levels you'll be doing the same thing over and over again untill you meet one of the bosses.   Corporate Lifestyle Simulator is not a very hard game. You could rescue other employees, who then in return help you fight the undead but there is no real reason why you should rescue them. Yes, after each mission there's a scorelist to see if you killed all zombies and how many people you have rescued but that's about it. There are no leaderboards or achievements so personally I just don't care.   Overall the game is quite fun nd you will be having a laugh but you probably will only beat this game once (which should take max 2 hours) and never return to it. it's just not enough to fully recommend this game.

Also the arsenal of weapons is quite nice - you have stapler, fire extinguisher and deo spray flamer among others.  This is a shooter/action game with a bit of humor in it.   If you like such graphics style then you may want to check it out during some Steam Sale.",

I mean, it would be the same gameplay either way, but the route they took was extremely lighthearted. I mean, everything about the game is lighthearted and it just feels good to play.  Also, the music's great.  Also also sometimes it crashes :(",

            "review_text": "A fun game to play if you are bored and just need something to do, With the new music player on steam the sound track is definitely worth a purchase on its own without the game 36 songs and as far as I can see they are all pretty good.  The game itself is pretty decent, the way the people look is slightly strange as everyone looks like they have been in the local fast food place for a little too long, whether it is a way at looking at the obese population of society or just the people not being too good at making people you tell me, that doesn't really take away from the game at all and it is still enjoyable, the cutscenes between the levels are kind of awkward to watch as the voice acting isn't the best in the world but some of it is quite amusing to watch, if this bugs you you can skip them and get to the action quicker.  Wide variety of weapons available and with power ups appearing now and again to make it more enjoyable (flamethrowing chainsaw...I think yes) some ranged some melee so it does give you an option on how to play.  I personally bought the game on sale for £1.24 (Soundtrack edition) I would say the off sale price for the soundtrack is worth it more than the game but that is just an opinion. I would say if you don't have a powerful machine to run a lot of games at a solid 30 and suffer from frame drops (me currently) it is a decent game to pick up. If you also don't have tons of money as well as this I would suggest putting this game on the list",

WELL worth the price, I think the price is perfect for attracting buyers and not over-charging them, as it is rather short, comparibly. However, if you really like the game, you'll have a lot of fun either replaying levels or playing endless mode. I love how you have a fricken' mech in the last level :D Epic end-boss, as with the soundtrack, which in my opinion makes the game twice as good.

The soundtrack is effective, punchy and relaxing simultaneously. The action is constant and satisfying. The gameplay is simple, yet rewarding.
