            "review_text": "Like the sequel Shank 2 is a cheesy 2D platformer &amp; beat'em up game that plays in Mexico. It has it's own graphic style. There's a little bit gore and brutal scenes especially on the boss kills. You start with 3 different weapon classes, melee = chainsaw (yeah!) double pistols (akimbo style, you can fly during shooting in the air because of recoil wtf?) and 2 daggers to pounce on enemies. Somehow the movements and controls are a little bit clunky. There are still lags even on high end systems.  They added lately some MP gamemode Survival which means you have to survive in a certain map with applicable traps &amp; buy equipment mode 30 waves. There are even zombie waves. Strangely if you play over internet it gets at some point dissynchronized. So if you are protecting your armory piles some Goonies can blastup another one than on your teammate map. That's unacceptable and makes it either incredible hard to survive 30 waves.  Good is that you can unlock many new charcters. My favourite is Sunshine dressed like the girl from KillBill with a longsword and desert eagles. The main game suffers from repetive enemies and a quite flat boring story.Though you can do some counterattacks the gameplay hasn't really changed. The hard mode still exists. So you can play story mode at least twice ...",

            "review_text": "If you're playing Shank 2, you more than likely played the first before it and thought 'holy crap this is a really cool cheesy game' and you're right it was. Shank 2 is just more of the same, just with a different setting, a few improved features, and not much else.  Now, more of the same isn't a huge problem, but in its haste to do better than the original it missed a few key points. For starters, while the original game's plot is basically Kill Bill only with a badass mexican dude, it felt structured as if there's a direction and application to the titular hero's badass anger management sessions. Shank was all about revenge, but not really in the way you first expect. It's not shocking, but every set piece and level felt like a step closer to your goal as you eliminated each threat one after the other. Shank 2 is just 'Shank is going to visit his home town, ♥♥♥♥ happens, Shank doesn't care but kills things anyways' so it's less progression and more absentminded wandering around the country until Shank shanks the right people. While from the beginning it's clear the goal is to rescue the woman who ran Shank's orphanage, there's really no direction to that point. Shank just runs from location to location being Shank until things happen. Even worse, because Shank follows this narritive structure, every boss battle becomes 'Shank meets and kills people who get in his way.' Sadly this also extends to the final battle where Shank fights someone who - again - mirrors his attack patterns, except rather than be the guy who taught him these things, you fight someone who just attacks recklessly and is defeated by dodging his attacks until he blows himself up on his own explosives. Honestly it's really hard to follow up from the last game's final boss.  As you noticed I haven't really talked about the gameplay yet. Well, it's because, like I said, it's more of the same. There's less demand for Shank's signature flying tackle move but fighting is incredibly fluid and combo heavy, there's also many items to pick up and use to make use of every combat. Really the strong selling point to this game however is the various new enemy types. While you still fight the endless same-faced melee and gun mooks, you also get to play footsies with larger enemies, fat guys, women, and small guys, each with their own style of combat. So while it is more of the same, it doesn't feel stale. Co-Op has been incorporated into an all new Survival mode, which plays pretty well and is a good way to test your fighting skills though there is no Co-op campaign this time around.  So Shank 2 still is a solid game, but it's a solid meh kind of game. The flashy straight to DVD Shank compared to the original worldwide release Shank. If you liked the original or you just like beat-em-ups, you'll probably like this but don't expect to remember it a few weeks later. Game's been out long enough too that it sells for pretty cheap to boot.",

The story in this one is more like Collatoral damage of Taken 2 where you should know not to mess with someone who just tore your troops apart like mere tissue paper and killed one of your generals in a horrific way.  Really, Shank was just fine, drinking booze on the bus and if you left him alone nothing would happen. To quote spoony: 'But oh no. You had to come down and shake his ♥♥♥♥ing tree and now he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and going to come after you' which is the basic plot of the story, plus for a single level you get to be a different character and switing weapons is done in a in-game menu whilst paused which is so much easier.  Only real downside is I feel sick that it had to be related to EA. Eitherway, if you liked the first you'll love this and if you didn't like the first. Well, things have improved and controls are less confusing and better made for PC use but generally I'd say only buy if on a sale.",

With the main hook gone from the first game, ie revenge, the story in Shank 2 is clearly as deep as the 2-dimensional graphics but no more or less poorly executed than it's predecessor. The story is a thin veneer but, if you want a modern beat'em up that opens up the mechanics of the previous entry in the series, then the game will provide. Controllers recommended for best experience.  Survival is challenging and a nice addition geared towards repeat playing but one hopes that there would be a custom level editor or future content to expand on it, as it only sports three maps. Blocking from Shank1 is replaced with a rolldodge. 2 also lacks the prior's co-op campaign with it's nice killsharing, but that's not so bad with the Survival mode in it's place. Recommended for anyone who loves a grisly cartoon and can stomach thin plots in their games, ones that rips the jaws off of sharks gratuitously for your viewing pleasure.",

Shank 2, with its superb art, suffers a similar fate but with an even weaker story and more uninspired foes.  Gameplay-wise, Shank 2 tries hard to be diverse. There is a large variety of actions and attacks at your disposal and in moments of high intensity, it's all too easy to get buttons mixed up, resulting in eventual death.  To encourage replayability, Shank 2 boasts a leaderboard that tracks player scores built up by combos and items collected. Additionally, there are a dozen or so alternative skins unlocked by completing achievements. If you're not interested in those, then one playthrough may be enough.  Grade: C",

The result is that most deaths in this game feel a lot more justified than in Shank 1.   The original game's controls were dumb enough - it required 12 buttons to perform all actions, completely ridiculous for a fighting game with such a shallow combat system. This one is even worse, with 14 buttons required. They added a dedicated 'pick up/use' button, and added 2 (!) dodge buttons. These add absolutely nothing to the gameplay, but make it so that you have to map a couple controls to the right analog stick... really really stupid. Do you want your dodges to require you to move your thumb from attack/jump controls? Probably not.  They mostly got rid of the QTE type boss fights from Shank 1. Boss fights in this one involve shooting your guns A LOT, maybe 300-500 hits kills a boss. They feel more like Mega Man bossfights than fighting game boss fights. When EVERY boss gets to half health, you can grapple to trigger a short cinematic.  Presentation wise, this game is quite a few notches below Shank 1. What little story there was there is pretty much eliminated here. Cutscenes are quite poor quality, and some of them look like they were hand drawn, scanned to 720p and then stretched poorly to 1920x1200. The game takes place in south or central america, but all voice actors sound like they're white game developers from Seattle. The drop in quality makes me think the budget for this must have been a step down from Shank 1.  Due to less cheap deaths, I'd say this game is better than Shank 1 by a hair, but still pretty poor. The controls are stupid and overly complicated for such a simple game, the combat system is still pretty much button mash with the occasional jump out of the way, and the presentation is almost non-existent.  I WILL recommend Mark of the Ninja, don't be scared off of it because of this, but by the same token, don't by Shank thinking it'll be the same quality as MotN.  ",

The controls are wobbly and the gameplay is the same basic gimmick. Dodge and counter-attack. If it wasn't for the constant waves of enemies you have to fight, it would be a much duller game. As for replay value, it serves no purpose in going back, unless you're an achievement hunter. There would be no way of going back to this game aside from playing survival mode with your friends. Which gets pretty lame after the first few rounds. Would not recommend if it wasn't on sale. 4/10",

I loved the first mission however for whatever reason it goes to a snow level and Boss you have to kill in a certain way without dying once otherwise its back to the start of the boss fight again. No thanks. If you enjoy uber hard challenge and little to no hand holding and little to no help from the game then this is the game for you. If you enjoy rigid and only way to kill certain things then this is the perfect game for you.   The game is not for people who get frustrated easily. As you will die a lot and then die a lot some more.",

Because it's very repetitive, the musics are the same for the whole game, and that's very annoying to play with that dümb music playing and playing again. But, nevermind the music, you can turn it off (Of course you can, if not, I would be god damn dead right now), let's talk about the gameplay itself. You play Shunk, or whatever, and you cut people. That's all ! You cut people with knifes and machetes again and again ! Enemies are all the same, checkpoint is a forbidden word in this game, bosses are just boring and wasting your time, etc. But at least it's pretty decent when you look at the graphics, yeah, it's all drawn-by-hand, and it looks awesome ! It 'looks' awesome. Looks.  Ups :  - Nice graphics - In the first hours, it's still fun to switch between Knifes, Machetes, Guns, etc., it makes the first levels a little more exciting - You don't need a PC from the NASA to make it work, and that's a good point if your PC is cheap. - A little coop mode, didn't test it yet. (I need to find someone who likes this game first...)  Downs :  - Musics are... BLEH. - Too repetitive - Enemies are all the same - Bosses are full of bugs, and seriously not interresting - The story. I don't understand anything about this 'conflict' or whatever. You maybe need to play the 1st game before playing this one.   I do not recommand it, but I cannot spit on it, I had fun on this game !",

I finished 95% of the game and than quit because the crapy controls wouldnt let me use the machine gun that u would use to kill the waves of brutes running your way. 0/10 worst game ever made i'd rather give a homeless guy on the street 10€ insted of buying this excuse for a game.

If you like good graphic style and simply mashing buttons until reaching the checkpoint then buy it.

This isn't even a Game For Windows Live game, and it still doesn't want to play nice with my PS2-style controller, which is functionally identical to the XBox controller, just laid-out for a human hand instead of a jock meat-claw. I don't understand why developers refuse to acknowledge and support this issue. It happens with every single game of this genre since Arkham Asylum (probably before, but that's the oldest recent one I've played), and every time we're forced to hack open our ini files and fix it ourselves because nobody in the dev community cares enough to properly port their game to PC.  Shank 2 gets an F for being completely unplayable. And too bad, because it seems like a lot of fun.",

            "review_text": "This is essentally the same game as Shank and comes with all of the same flaws, plus a few more.  Mainly, that the game just isn't very challenging and has been severely dumbed down for the casual market compared to old school beat 'em ups like Streets of Rage. Giving you infinite lives and checkpoints takes all of the fun out of this type of game. If nothing else at least offer an option to set limited lives and continues while retaining an 'infinite lives' option for casual players who are just playing it through for the 'story'.  Speaking of story, it also took a turn for the worse. While the original Shank's revenge plot was at least interesting enough to care about, the plot in this game is just generic 'B-movie' fare and makes no mention of the characters from the original at all. The settings are also a lot less diverse and interesting, boiling down to dark dismal jungle and industrial environments which are a lot less nice to look at. The added in-game voice acting is also unnecessary and for the most part downright cheesy.  Essentially the game retains the same flaws with little in the way of improvement, and a few additions that make the gameplay worse:   *Easy, short campaign, little to no replay value with the only unlockables being alternate costumes and character bios that add nothing to the gameplay  *Poorer controls than in the original (having to use seperate buttons to dodge left and right)  *A survival mode which had potentional but is multiplayer only (and with no one playing it online this mode is only accessable if you have a real-life buddy to play with)  I really can't recommend this except to casual gamers who typically play Facebook or Zynga games (and even then, the strong language and gore will probably be a turn-off to the type of people who play Farmville or Candy Crush Saga).",
