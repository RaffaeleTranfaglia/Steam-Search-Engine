            "review_text": "'Escape the Lost Game: The Forgotten Ending'  I find it really unfortunate I can't in good conscience recommend this game. Visually, it's quite a nice looking low res. casual game, it's fully voiced, and even has a decent adventure/hidden object mix. And it's about one of my favorite subjects, ancient Egypt, to boot.  Why can't I recommend it then?  Easy. The ending chapter isn't included. Apparently it was part of a Collector's Edition not available on Steam. Normally that's not much of a problem, but the store page here clearly shows content nowhere to be found in this game, and the main story introduced in the opening cutscene is hardly even referenced again, let alone fleshed out and wrapped up. At first I thought I somehow missed something despite all of the map's rooms stating they were cleared. The only way I was able to figure out where these missing scenes were was to search on Google, which I find very sloppy to have not been at least mentioned on the page. It doesn't help the non-CE ending is a sudden, out-of-nowhere black screen with a simple white lettered 'Game Over.' No credit roll. No feeling it actually ended and you hadn't somehow managed to screw up a hidden object game. Very disappointing, especially since the rest the of the game is pretty great for the genre, despite its short length (1.5 hours, not rushed, listening to all the dialogue and enjoying the scenes) and a few quirks.  Pros: -Nice, but low resolution artwork -Pretty good atmosphere for a casual title -Fully voiced -Gameplay is a nice mix of adventure and hidden object, complete with standard hidden object search areas and a full inventory you carry room-to-room -Potentially had/has (perhaps in the Collector's Edition) an interesting brother versus brother story, quite fitting for an Egyptian setting considering the importance of Osiris and Set (two gods who were also feuding brothers) in their mythology  Cons: -Not the Collector's Edition and is missing content displayed on the store page -An hour and a half long -The main and most intriguing story is ignored after the opening cutscene, with sparse and minimal exceptions in the form of other characters vaguely mentioning a second, forgotten pharaoh  -Few quirks, particularly in dialogue, such as misaligned text and oddly shifting the spelling of the name of and gender of the cat  For its current sale price of $1.25, sure, go for it. Full price? Probably not. You won't even realize you successfully completed the game and will be left wondering where some of the awesome looking store page scenes are.  I honestly wish there was a neutral button on Steam, as I wouldn't necessarily say, 'Avoid this.' Rather, be aware of how oddly it ends before you get there, and be aware some particularly interesting bits (the video shows you playing Senet, for example) are not included in this edition.  Still, solid 3/5 for gameplay and the partial story it includes, plus the intelligent, interesting use of objects in scenes (and finding objects you'll actually need) and inclusion of some real ancient Egyptian mythology. It would've been an easy 4/5 (for the genre) if the non-CE ending wasn't so abrupt, and the store page only showed content actually in the game.",

            "review_text": "Short (around 2h), but very cute game and very enjoyable for people that are fans of both Egyptian culture and indie games. The graphics and the story are nice and the scenes have subtitled dialogues. The game has rather simple puzzles and the few hidden object scenes support 3D vision which adds a nice feature to it. I recommend this game for those that enjoy hidden object games and a feeling of Indiana Jones adventure.   More reviews on the  Lilly's Corner Curator page  ",

            "review_text": "Ugh. As others have noted, this game is incomplete on Steam, missing the exciting conclusion. As it stands, it's very short and ends abruptly.  Too bad! The little content that's there is fun and innovative. The game uses 3D glasses (red/cyan) and it's highly recommended to get some to play the game. The hidden-object scenes really pop out! The game system also lets you switch between characters, and each has its own special flavor and abilities.  Alas, the engine is quite buggy. Sounds will play simultaneously multiple times if you click on something more than once before the sound ends playing. On a few occasions, my clicks did not register in hidden-object scenes. At one point, you are allowed to choose the order of chapters: I guess I chose wrongly! Even though I already had the sister find the brother, when we met the parents they wondered where my brother was. So, I guess the order is important after all.  Also, I'm quite angry about this bumbling American family destroying ancient Egyptian tombs. :) It's supposed to be a family game, but that aspect is extremely anti-educational! But, I guess, adventure?",

The game is very small, not that difficult since the solutions to the puzzles are presented to you. The only thing that made it a bit harder for me was the poor quality of the images of the hidden-object challenges but nothing that I couldn't overcome. The game isn't worth the money, at least I got it in a bundle with way better games of the same genre so my loss wasn't that significant.",
