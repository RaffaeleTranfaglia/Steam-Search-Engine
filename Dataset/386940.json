Although lag may sometimes looks like your opponents were hit and didn't die, that's just purely graphic problem.",

Four people who had no idea how to play this game picked it up in minutes, and then we all sat together on the couch roaring with laughter as we got decapitated by errant propellers and sucked into black holes. Even the one person who is basically incompetent at platformers (me!) had a great time.  The game is this. Each round, you and your opponents each add one element to a platforming obstacle course. Then, you all have to run the course. If nobody makes it through, nobody gets any points, so the goal is to make the course hard but still doable. Elements include stuff to jump on like planks and moving platforms, as well as hazards like circular saws and crossbows. You get points for completing the course, and you also get points if one of your hazards kills an opponent. There's a lighthearted and cartoonish aesthetic, which turns hilarious as dead characters get cartoonishly X-ed out eyes and goofily ragdoll through the course.  You can't get any better entertainment than this for fifteen bucks, guys. Go buy it!  ",

This game is amazing! The gameplay is really fun, and you can play with friends OR strangers, locally and online! The best part about online is that you experience no server lag whatsoever, because it's all client-sided (i think that's the term)! You may see other people a little jittery, but like this, you can play with anybody around the world, and still have a blast, because all your movements are as smooth as if you were playing with someone right next to you! There still are some bugs, but the developpers are working to fix them.  Okay, I just want to point out... THE OST IS AMAZING! I'm so sad that I didn't buy it, because it's not on youtube, and I didn't think it would be this amazing! So if you can, buy it along with that soundtrack. So far, my favorite are waterfall and the party level. The graphics are fun and friendly, and all the animals look adorable! Each map in the game has some different thing about it, and each has their own song. You can find cosmetics for your animals, new animals in general, and new maps for when you host a server as you play!  In conclusion, I have not even played the game that much yet, but I'm already having a blast. When seananners first played this game, it looked so fun, and I waited for it to be on sale. Glad I bought this. Worth every cent. Wish I got that OST though, so amazing.",

            "review_text": "Ultimate Chicken Horse (UCH) is one of the best (local) multiplayer games out there when played with friends. It is a 2D-platformer with simple graphics, where each player choses a farm animal of his or her choice to compete against each other. Up to four players can play together in a total of 10 different levels, both local and online. Most of the levels (and some other stuff) is locked in the beginning and is randomly unlocked by playing certain levels at the right time (you'll now how and when to do this).   Basically, UCH is a Super Mario like Jump n'Run, where you have to reach the end of a level. However, there is a pretty cool twist to this old-school mechanic: After each 'race' in the current level, players have to chance to place an object to 'make the level more difficult'. In other words, they will try to f**k you up. Of course, they still want to finish the level as well. Thus, the placement of objects is a dilicate matter. There is a rather sophisticated point system involved to determine the winner of a level. For example, you can get 'post mortem' extra points...  The game offers some other game modes as well, but I think that the real fun begins if your play with three friends locally in the described 'party mode'. While the number of levels is low, the replay value is immensely high due to a random selection of items which can be placed each turn. In a recent patch, the developers also added the possibility to share levels between users, i.e., you are able to prepare a level with a choice of items and then send it your friends to see them fail. It really is a bit like Mario Maker for PC, but with chickens and horses.  One drawback is the rather small selection of items right now. There is definitly room for improvement, but certain mechanics and hillarious traps make up for it. Especially the fact that you can combine different items via 'honey' to make terrifying death traps. This also works for the various moving objects.  Overall, I really can recommend this game. It is one of the funniest multiplayer games I have played and has a good controller support. It works nice in local multiplayer and different options allow to customize the game modes further. However, I have not tried the included online mode yet, but this possibility exists as well.   Buy this game, you won't regret it! :)  4.5/5",

This means the players themselves make their own diffculties ranging from walks in the park to the absolute embodiment of Satan himself. Yep, that's it.  At first the online portion of the game was um.. Shotty at best? But lord has that changed! Online connectivity has increased dramatically thanks to the latest updates! There's also couch to online coop. You're welcome~  The unlock system can be a rather confusing... I would simply recommend hosting online matches to increase your unlock rates (host seems to always unlock maps quickly).

The reason why I gave it a negative review is because the BUGS and bad community are overwelming making this such a frustrating experience that becomes almost impossible to play.  The bugs I ran into are super lame such as phantom games where you try to join but the game does not exist, or full games showing in the game list over and over again, inconsistency of traps where some times they act some way and others ways act differently like the plants that most of the times punch with a short delay and others immediatly, games that drop for no reason in the middle of the play, or even more serious ones where the game start but no one can take any action or some members can't select an item to play. I know most of this stuff seems rather simple but i guarantee you that it adds up with time and becomes unberable even because there are such a few games being played at any given time that its really frustrating to finally find one just to be dropped in the middle of it.   Another problem I found is the high latency. Yes I live in South America so I would not fit in any of the regions mentioned but I play many other games online in US servers with no problem at all and here I always recive a Bad Connection message.   Lastly the community...what to say, it all adds up in the end...There are a lot of kinds or trolls that either want to make levels super simple and explode EVERY single intelligent obstacle that would make the level interestingue or you find the total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that simply put a plank in front of a passage making it impassable and impossible. Sum all the bugs, with the few games and the poor community together and you get a TERRIBLE gaming experience out of an AMAZING game.   Buy this if you pretend to play local with some friends but dont do it for the online experience.",

            "review_text": "More Reviews @  TheVideogameBacklog.com   This has to be one of the weirdest titles I’ve read in a long time. Along with that: it is also one of the more imaginative games I’ve played in a long time. Mixing up platforming with player-created-on-the-spot levels is genius.  While this game can be played with two people, or yourself and three other controllers, The Ultimate Chicken Horse is a dish best served with three other people (always better with friends)! As the level changes after every round as dictated by each player, the levels only get crazier and crazier. Unless someone uses the bomb and cleans it up a little. However, sometimes some spring cleaning is in order unless you don’t really want to progress.  Allowing on-line play was one of the smartest moves for Clever Endeavour Games. It’s not something that I can remember many small party games like this having missed lately, but it is something I could see someone taking a stance on. “Get your friends over like we did back in the day.” That’s weird to some people, but that was the norm back when I was a kid. It’s buggy currently, but they are diligently working on it. All this to say: it will still be more fun with your buds right there to punch.  I can understand the way multplayer is done currently, but it’s not my favorite. Given the flavor of the game, a more open multiplayer would have been more appreciated. However, since trying to make my own game and getting caught up with tiny details not working, if it was this “port-forwarding-friend-menu”method or nothing, then this trumps any complaint. I simply got used to this method of connecting with Magicite, but didn’t really appreciate it because of the lack of friends playing the same game. I like these type of games while not many of my buds would be willing to drop as little change down as Ultimate Chicken Horse costs. A more fluid, server-based multiplayer would have opened the floodgates to a more populated online experience in an ideal world. It could very well have been a lot of time spent coding and then been underused and that time could have been better spent. There are to many variables and let’s just say that I’m happy to at least have the option.  Score: Tasty!  Ultimate Chicken Horse is pretty darn unique. It still surprises me that some devs can come up with something like this out of nowhere when it feels like it should have been a part of our gaming library for a long time now. There are a lot of tools to hinder you and your friends with and enough levels to add some variety to the gameplay. Ultimate Chicken Horse is definitely worth picking up if you’ve got some buds that enjoy good platforming fun-time.",

The online can be a bit buggy (though it's been getting better with every update), but even if it were perfect a lot of the fun comes from the banter with your friends when someone's clogged up the entry with 'Canadians' (what we ended up calling the hockey puck launchers).  The gameplay itself is simple - a 2D platformer where you have to get to the flag. The first few maps are also incredibly simple. Each round after everyone dies or reaches the flag, you get given a selection of traps or platforms to pick from and each add one to the map. As it goes on, it gets more chaotic.  It has lots of replayability because of the randomness in terms of what setpieces you're given, but also the more complex maps can have more fun interactions between traps and movables that are a part of the map.  Waterfall and Windmill are quite frustrating because completing them after the first round of placements is often a rarity, which makes the game have quite a slow start, but that's the only criticism I have about the game.  I was going to nominate this for 'Best Use of a Farm Animal', but decided that actually it should be nominated for 'Most Prominent Featuring of Farm Animals' because in terms of gameplay they could be literally anything that's small and cute.

Ultimate Chicken Horse makes for a great party game as you work with friends to make a devlishly difficult but not impossible obstacle course. The traps and obstacles are awesome, and nothing beats the feeling of watching your friend get skewered by a crossbow bolt or sucked in to a vortex. I also appreciate that the game is easily played in hotseat mode.",

You are suppose to put objects down whether they be traps, platforms or something else, the goal remains the same. Get to the goal. Now most the online games I've played I have been UNABLE to grab an item. Some times I've been kicked for not being able to grab. I can't say the same for local because I don't have friends. If you can play local, buy it.  I will change my vote when they fix this bug.   EDIT: I don't know what it was, but everything seems okay now. Get this game for some 'How did I get hit by that?' moments.",
