Maybe if you're uncontrollably curious about extremely minor aesthetic details, you'll love this game. Every time you boot this game up will feel like Christmas morning.   For the rest of us, you could get a better experience by just going outside and talking to your weird neighbor in real life.",

If you're looking for a game with goals that's meant to be played for hours on end, then this isn't the game for you, no. However, if you enjoy chill games, short bursts of play (such as the recommended 10-20 mins) or have a tumblr, you'll probably like this game. It honestly just reminds me of amateur art but I mean that in the best way.",
