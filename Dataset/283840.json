I have played to many shoot em ups since then and I have found only a few worth playing. Of course Radiant Silvergun, Ikaruga, Gradius V and Gaiden and so on. Alltynex second is clearly worthplaying. It has good graphics, good music and smart gameplay that includes a silvergun-style sword.  As hapens with Ikaruga, it is a bit too short, but I strongly recommend it. By the way, I am enjoying very much Reflex, so I should say that the tales of alltynex package is a good choice.",

I discovered the Blade Mode. Well, that was my fault, to not watching the tutorial and the input settings...  Now, I'm getting used to it, and the Blade mode really adds something to the gameplay. You feel very powerful, slashing ships 10 times bigger than yours. You also eat bullets as if they were your cereals at breakfast. So tasty.",
