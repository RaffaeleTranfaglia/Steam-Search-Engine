The developer has only completed the beginning of the story, which takes about an hour to play through, but it already has the makings of a great game. If you were waiting for Steam to give you something new and interesting, or maybe you remember the times when games were not designed by 'borrowing' pieces of existing games and pasting them together, play LAND OF LAMIA.",
