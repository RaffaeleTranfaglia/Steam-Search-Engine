    "description": "1933 will go down in the history books as the year America passed the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. Prohibition is over. To the delight of millions, alcohol can now flow freely across the thirsty land. Two days before the official announcement, bars and clubs across the land are stocking up on quality whiskey.",

            "review_text": "I love me some point and click adventures but the short time I've spent with Jack suggests this isn't for everyone, or anyone.   The animation is off putting, the scenes seem random, the charactisation laughable. It'd be great to see someone do a good modern adventure set in the 30's but this is really poor.   Get ready for unskippable scenes, random re-starts and some awful looking gameplay. Feels like a game that'd be nice as a shareware download for AGS but as a real game for sale in public marketplace it falls way short of the mark.  Hey, it's cheap though so there's that!",

It reminds me of a harder version of a Game I used to play with my brother back in the day. The Pajama Sam Seris. Very similar the two. But of course this one is a little harder. Like for example 'it took me forever how to open my inteventory!' (It's F1) It's not just the adventure and story line that's awesome. But it's the action and drama that i also like. You fight a black guy and a italian. I don't no about you but when the black guy returns and get's revenge i was actually glad. It brought a smile to my face. I think that what gamers deserve when they play a great game like this one!  I Recommend this game!",
