            "review_text": "  This is a visual novel where all you do is click to go foward. There are no choices, no scares, and the writing is like sub-parr creepypasta. The game is all tell, no show, and even though it tell you everything, it still is a convoluted mess. And the graphics are just... something.   Despite the game's lack of gameplay, the game still has a bug in it. If you're playing the game in steam's onlline mode, the game will occasionally close steam in the background, somehow. It's annoying if you're trying to show it to your friends via steam brodcast.  This game took about 30 minutes to play, so if you really want to subject yourself to this for whatever reason, you'll be well within the time limit it takes to refun it.",
