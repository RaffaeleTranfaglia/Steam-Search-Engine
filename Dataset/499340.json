            "review_text": "Turner is a simple puzzle-platformer with mysterious exposition. Although it isn't a terribly long game, it does feature challenge versions of every level once you complete the game. The hand drawn story boards and pulsing music adds a lot to Turner's unique charm. As the player progresses through the game, new abilities are added, along with new challenges. Turner does a great job at leading the player level to level, slowly teaching them how to play. By the end of the game you will find yourself using every ability and skill you have learned along the way, none of which become obsolete.   This game is fun, challenging, and intriguing, but there are a few features I would have liked to see. I really would have loved to see a 'Reset Level' feature, as I had to go back to the main menu on level 182(?) as it is possible to get stuck. Also, since this game is ripe for speedrunning, in-game timers would have been nice. Or at least an individual level mode to try to get the best IL times.   For the ridiculously low price tag, you really can't go wrong.  ",

            "review_text": "Lots of levels based on a interesting central game mechanic. I liked the idea of shifting the level around the player. It plays like a mixture of portal and super meat boy. Overall, Turner is a nice little game that's defiantly worth the reasonable price. Check it out, its only the price of a candy bar, and it doesn't make you feel fat afterwards.",
