    "description": "RAMS is a shooter based on the mechanics of Battle Royale, but with more attention to detail, a sharp focus on experience of your every moment during playtime. RAMS is much deeper than a standard shooter, with the ability to expand and train your character. You're more than just a gun. Go get 'em!",
