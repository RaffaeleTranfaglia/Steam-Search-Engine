            "review_text": "I bought this game with low expectations, but it was cheap, so I took a gamble. I was most put off by the poor English in store page and such, considering it seems to be a quasi-fantasy game roughly about the English settlement of North America.  I was pleasantly surprised. I started playing it, and I did not stop for 7 hours. Even now, I only stopped playing because I started falling asleep in my chair.  It's a slow-paced, easy-going town-builder in which you grow your 'colony' from a single building and a few colonists into a bustling village, complete with trade, jobs, building upgrades, and scientific research. I really appreciated that it never makes you feel anxious about staying on top of things, like the Anno series can sometimes do. You totally set the pace in this game, so if you're looking for a relaxing play, this could be for you.  I was surprised by the quality of the game. While a few things are a bit off--like the way the colonists perform the exact same animation at the exact same time when they talk to one another--the game shows a lot of polish, overall. I never felt like my enjoyment of the game was being damaged in any way by a lack of effort or expertise on the part of the game's designers and/or developers.  It's a bit like a slimmed down and streamlined Sims meets Farmville meets Anno, without any stressful situations, pushy monetization, or excessive micromanagement. Overall, I would recommend this game to fans of its genre, though I would not really know what to call it.",

            "review_text": "The art style is cute, and the game is enjoyable for the first couple of hours. You gradually come to realize that what you thought was the tutorial is actually the entire game. There's only one map, and the game basically takes you step by step through it. You can't fail at anything, and there's no challenge. The entirety of the game you will spend simply waiting for more of a resource to collect so you can build something that will then require you to wait for more of a resource to collect. It's as if someone took the resource management part of Age of Empires and turned it into a game. The end result is there's nothing at all you can do with your resources. If there was a game speed increase, you could finish the entire game in 20 minutes.   There's some lurking potential here if some mechanics for challenge were added. I kept hoping the 'game map' was a shortened tutorial map that would later throw you into a series of more unforgiving islands. Perhaps the developers will later turn this into a full-fledged title with suitable strategy, but I cannot recommend the gameplay that's presented here.",

            "review_text": "I brought this game at 75% discount. Totally worth it, finished it in one day. While the game itself isn't complicated and needs a very little planning (you can achieve the final goal even a longer roundabout way). The gameplay is smooth, a bit slower paced at the end (maybe), it mainly depends on your building/research choices (there isn't many, the progressing is linear). I recommend this game for cute character designs, the great BGMs, some hilarious animations with sounds (e.g. male chars eating, alpaca shaving, etc), interesting elements with the gameplay (ship battles, house/room management). If you have a few bucks and love this kind of games get it, or get it at discount time for yourself/friends/children!",

To complete everything in the game took me about 15 hours. It was nice, laid back, and an easy play. I think I probably picked it up on sale for &lt; $2, and it was worth that. I think my kids will like it, too.",

The game is especially perfect for someone who enjoys Facebook games involving building up settlements, as it is similar to one, without the long waiting times and the need for friends.  Also contains an “Angry Birds” type mini game, and a few little puzzles.  The animations are cute, and although it does not have amazing life-like graphics, they are smooth, and do not strain the eyes.  The game would make an ideal gift for someone like me, used to playing Facebook games.   My only one complaint would be that you can’t run it in the background while doing other things, as it pauses itself, and like any game that’s enjoyable you wish it could go on for longer.  Definitely, worth getting if you like these types of games, particularly when on sale. ",

            "review_text": "A ship filled with a few villagers arive on a new piece of land.  The land looks inhabited at first, and the villagers start building a Warehouse to store there goods.   Soon they start collecting rocks and wood.  And not much later they even mine iron, silver and gold from the earth caves.  They ceate fields and cultivating them to sustain themselves of food.  Explore and examine ruins to learn about the mysteries of the people that lived here before.   Eventualy they also discover a friendly Native Tribe, and they battle against pirates.  Excess goods they load on the ship and sell it for a good profit in the Old World, and maybe bringing back new villager to live (and work) in the New World.   --- If you like peacefull, colourfull and cartoon style graphics, and games that invole a little bit of strategy. Then this is most likely a nice game to play. It is not very long however, but it sure is pretty. Currently the price is only €0,62, rediculessly low in my opinion. This game has much to offer, and even the original price of €6,99 is fair in my opinion.   Great game about putting your mini villagers to work and see them get busy on starting a whole new village.",

I found myself just leaving it running towards the end so I could complete it. I couldn't finish the last achievement because I would've had to sit and wait for ages for some things to respawn. That was partly due to my own poor planning though.  Although there were some minor issues with the game (it crashed on me once - no progress lost though), all in all I quite enjoyed it. It took me about 10 1/2 hours to complete fully other than the one achievement. I think had I pursued that it would've taken another 1-2 hours but it would've just been sitting and waiting.   I'd say if you're a fan of casual games, this is definitely one worth buying. It's certainly worth it for how much it costs.",
