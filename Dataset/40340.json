Some of the puzzles might need a bit of thinking, and voiceacting isn't the best, but overall this game is pretty good. For 2009 atleast :)  This game taught me a lot. But the best moral is: 'Everyone should have his stove door' :D",

            "review_text": "Story was good. Voice acting of non-main characters was good; for some reason, ALL main characters voice acting was very poor. But it may have actually been the writing not the acting...couldn't tell. Also could be related to German -&gt; English translation. Puzzles pretty good. Some nicely drawn scenes. Graphical glitches here and there...not many bugs found.  I would only recommend this for adventure game fans of Secret Files and/or the developer (Animation Arts). Otherwise, it is just too bland. As such, my general consensus is Not Recommended.",
