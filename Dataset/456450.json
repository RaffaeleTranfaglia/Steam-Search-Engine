You stand on stage next to his piano, you are amongst the band, you can see the audience, practically feel the heat from the fireworks, it's totally spectacular! Imagine experiencing any kind of gig or show like this and tell me it's not great! Also, sporting events, watch the ice hockey demo, brilliant! Want to watch the world cup final? One day you will virtually stand anywhere in the stadium or beside the pitch. I can't wait for it! For now 7/10. Potentially 20/10 :-)",
