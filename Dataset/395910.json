            "review_text": "Highschool project adventure/visual novel.  The page says the game needs 200 MB HD space, but it downloads 18 MB, and a third of that is the XNA framework. So, actual game ~12 MB. The graphics resolution is 720p, quality ranges from bad Flash drawings to beaten-to-death-with-effects photographs. There are 18 backgrounds and 16 characters, but you'll only get to see about half of these because the game crashes as soon as you sell something to the baker. The voiceovers have amateur quality as well. I am calling this a visual novel because you can't really manipulate items in the environment; most of the gameplay is cutscenes and dialogue (but you do get a movable avatar in three scenes, animation is 4 frames). One positive point: I can confirm that it will run (such as it can, seeing it crashes in the baker scene) on an old slow XP box.  It's a very incomplete amateur game. Don't pay money for this.",
