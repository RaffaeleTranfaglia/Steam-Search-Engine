            "review_text": "Mini Metro is an extremely polished, well made game by Dinosaur Polo Club (which is an amazing name, btw).  The premise is that you are designing the layout of a subway/train system to get people where they want. Instead of cluttering the gameplay with stats and names, everything is abstracted and simplified for a very smooth experience.  I have 87 hours on record on steam, and many more on their alpha version they had on their website previously.  You start on a map with 3 stations: A Square, a Triangle, and a Circle. At each station, passengers will appear and your job is to connect these stations so they can get to where they want. When a passenger appears, he will appear as a symbol, for example, a square. And the goal is to bring them to a station that matches their own symbols.  The trains themselves are smart, and will only pick up passengers that can be dropped off down the line OR allow them to switch lines at an interchange to get where they want.  As the game progresses, the map zooms out so and new stations are added. You will face increasing difficulty in the presence of unique symbols (which reinforces the need for efficient interchanges), as well as GLUT OF CIRCLES that is the doom of all system designers (once you play it, you will see what I mean).  Different game modes exist depending on your tastes:   Normal - The standard game where you can adjust/move your tracks at will Endless - Relaxed gamemode where you can play as long as you want with no loss condition Extreme - Tracks are permanent, so future planning is important!  They also have a Daily Challenge mode where you get to play the exact same layout as everyone else, so you can measure exactly how you stack up to other people.  Everything has Leaderboards, of course, so you can marvel at how some people can achieve the results they managed.  Non-Gameplay elements are also polished, pleasant music, smooth/clean UI, are all very appreciated.          YouTube™ Video:  Quick Introduction: Mini Metro&nbsp;",

You will never quite have all the resources you need to make the system fully efficient, so how will you allocate what you have? Time becomes a resource -- can you afford to spend time to contemplate a better arrangement?  Playing in normal mode, each game lasts about 15-20 minutes, so it's nice for when you have a smaller block of time. The interface is more sophisticated than the minimalist-looking screenshots might lead you to believe. The sounds and music are subdued and soothing.",

            "review_text": "I fell in love with Mini Metro from the first time I saw it, when it was the result of the Ludum Dare compo. It had a brilliant strategy of releasing a web-playable demo (RIP Unity Web Player), a demo so good that you could simply play it there and not buy the game.  But the guys at Dino Polo Club announced the Early Access, which I propmptly bought, as the potential with this game was really visible. And it did not disappoint. I am someone that is not much into narratives, but rich gameplay, and this is what this game offers: rich, profound gameplay.  In Mini Metro, you are the planner of the transportation system of a very abstract city. Stations with specific shapes will pop up all around the city, and characters will pop up in those stations. These characters will wait in the station for a train to pick up them, and the characters's destination matches their own shape. You will be able to lay down the train tracks and, depending on the mode you're playing, you will be able to change them to accomodate a bigger volume of people. If too many people remain in the station, however, the station will overcrowd and a timer will start. If the timer completes, you lose.  The best part of this game, though, is the soundtrack. You will not find it anywhere, except on Gameplay videos, as it is generated for all the action that is happening in the level: when characters pop up, when you change the lines layout, etc. The music is composed by the great Disasterpeace, so if you like his music, you'll love Mini Metro's music for sure.",

So, there is this day when I am done with clearing my seat (we were renovating our office) and was sitting with my Macbook Air (MBA in short) looking for something to play. My steam would not download any games in school as the school has blocked all gaming sites (IP I presume), even for staff, and I am too lazy to set up a VPN. My MBA could not handle anything that is too graphical (if you know what I mean), so I went and start Mini Metro.   The game is minimalistic, easy to understand, and fun. It is simply connection lines, shapes and moving rectangles that are presumably train carts. There is nothing intriguing about it, yet it is simplistically attractive, bite size (a game last around 3 to 5 minutes) and an extremely effective remedy for symptoms arised from office boredom, such as yawning and drowsiness.   After a couple of rounds, my boss, the department head, walked pass. She looked at my monitor, and asked, 'are you playing a game?'  It took me around two seconds to give her an appropriate.   'Nope. I'm working on a set of powerpoint slides for my class.'   'Oh, okay.' She walked away after that.  Well, that worked well, except that I no longer have any classes after that.   Still, great game for these kind of situations. ",

It's pretty casual, the sounds are great (and I personally love how each new line has it's own sounds), and there are almost no problems, the only one I've encountered in 3.8 hours of game was that the sound glitched and turned into a one-tone buzz that was only fixed by restarting the game.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

            "review_text": "I was hesitating to buy this game and kept it on the wishlist for a longer while, as it seemed expensive. When the Summer Sale came, I decided to buy something I really wanted to play. I felt like a transport sim, but Cities in Motiton didn't get good reviews, while Cities:Skylines were not cheap enough for me. Therefore I had only one choice within my budget and - to my surprise - It seems to be one of the best games for me in my collection!  First off, one of my favourite games of all time are:  - FTL - a more or less typical rougelike with significant strategy portion  - Transport Tycoon / Locomotion series - where one of the main tasks is to build efficient networks  Combine the two above and you get MiniMetro :).  I'm a busy guy, and I don't have more than a couple of hours every day to play games. Therefore I turn more and more frequently to short games, that I can finish in a day or two, with high replay value. Mini Metro fits this description perfectly. Randomly generated stations are always a challenge (fourth circle or triange station in a condensed area drive me nuts!), while variety of cities encourage to try different strategies. I hope the descriptions will be added soon, although discovering the differences is also a kind of fun.  One can look at the game as 100 years of a city growth condensed to 15-30 minutes. There are no resources - every 'week' you get something to expand your network. It might seem strange, that you can re-rout your trains in any possible way. That way the creators avoided making the game extremely difficult - fortunately the 'extreme' mode exist, adding that piece of realism for hardcore city transport organizers.  With such minimalistic design, there is a lot of room for immersion. It's very easy to imagine that triangle and circle station represent every day destinations, like work/home/market. Square is probably a railway station or airport - unique but important. Then there is a bunch of unique ones, that can easily translate to a football stadium, hospital, or other touristic attactions. Even with no sound, you can hear all those crowds, looking at the train with six symbols - each representing a traveller and his destination.  One of the best things about this game is the fact, that you are 100% focused on the core - designing the network as efficiently as possible. You don't have to waste more than a few seconds to build the route or add/move trains. If Transport Tycoon was simplified to a white board and lines with rectangles instead of detailed tracks and trains, you could finish the game in a fraction of usual time.  Overall - GREAT game! I was not expecting that much from such small game.  It's still early access and the devs are working hard to finish it - updates/hotfixes are frequent.  FULL VERSION UPDATE: EVEN MORE AWESOME!!!",

I played a lot of city planners when I was younger, but I always got caught up in how complex they would be (damn you, SimCity 2000!). Mini Metro is a fantastic, stripped-down city planner: all you have to worry about is getting people on to trains, and off of trains. It's incredibly engaging and relaxing, and after the most recent update, includes a great procedural soundtrack from Disaterpeace (Hyper Light Drifter, FEZ) that I wish I could just leave running while I'm working. It's endlessly replayable, and just... so good. Excellent.",

Thankfully, you can rearrange your lines after they're complete. It took me a while to realize that, so that's why I'm mentioning it. As for the cities, thedifference is the shape of the rivers and shorelines. These will effect how you use your tunnels. After a few maps, it does get pretty difficult.

It's clean and not overcrowded with features or unnecersary complexity. Yet there is still time for a few cool features - such as the ability to output .gifs of your game.  It's also highly additcive and can be played for hours. This is because there are many cities and three game modes (normal, endless, and extreme). To unlock cities you need to complete milestones in normal mode (eg. transport 1000 passengers) and to unlock cities in extreme mode you need to complete even tougher challenges (eg. transport 1000 passengers using only 1 tunnel, transport 1600 passengers with no more than 1 locomotive per line).   In normal mode you can move lines to respond to new stations, in extreme mode they are fixed. In normal and extreme mode you recieve investment (eg. a new line, tunnels, trains or carriages - you can choose) at the end of each week and you loose as soon as a station overcrowds. In endless mode you recieve investment based on efficiency milestones and stations do not overcrowd.  This game is 100% worth the money.",

The use of smooth crisp, sharply coloured diagrams really makes you feel like you are creating a tube map. It's amazing how immersive such a graphically simple game can be.  I have a few minor gripes; occasionally trains get stuck in the stations for no apparent reason. The random spawning of stations, whilst giving great replayability, can also sometimes make games unplayable.

Pros: + Intuative gameplay + Very nice minimalistic art, simplistic interface and controls + Relaxing background music and sound effects gel well with theme + Idividual games are not too long, generally 30 minutes (+/- 10 minutes) + Each map is different, with different rules and regulations, such as the maximum number of trains per line or number of seats per carriage - this is not explicitly stated in game (that I have seen) but these are nice to stumble across + Very relaxing, a great game for stress reduction + Features an even less stressful endless mode + Very addictive  Cons: - Removing stations from the middle of a line can be a bit fiddly but you will eventually get the hang of it (drag the line inbetween the station you want to remove and the next station over the station you want to remove)  - The random station spawns can get frustrating when you have 5 circles in a row!  Would very much recommend to anyone, especially for someone looking for a relaxing puzzle game or a building game  5/5",

It's actually kind of ridiculous that I could accumulate over 10 hours in a game so simple, but I managed to because this game is just so replayable. You'll find yourself trying over and over to top your previous scores, but not really in a fursturating way. There's a lot of strategy required to really rack up the big numbers, and those strategies change drastically from map to map. The sound design in this game is pretty cool too, the more passengers are being escorted, the more of a melody is played, and this goes well with the previously mentioned art style. One thing that's nice about this game is that you only need to use the mouse, unless you want a quicker way to pause. It's really nice if you, for whatever reason, can't use one of your hands during play. There's also daily challenges to keep you coming back, a good feature, but I didn't use it much. That's okay though - there's enough ways to challenge yourself between the 3 gamemodes and 12 maps. My only major issue with this game is the price point, however. $9.99 is a lot to ask for a game this simple. If it's on sale for $3 or maybe $6 less, it's definitely worth it, pick it up.",
