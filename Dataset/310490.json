            "review_text": "GREAT GAME!   Finished it in 51 hours (completionist, collected most of treasures-unnoticed) not counting the challenge modes and was a blast from the past lol!  + Nice 1970's vibe, music and nostalgia minus the LSD/drugs. + Good point &amp; click strategy-stealth-puzzle type of gameplay. + Lots (18) of interesting and big complex maps, some can take 30-100 minutes. + Some replay value from creativity to complete missions. + The game has a pause feature for planning) and have each do different tasks throughout the map. + Nice art - graphics, music and decent controls. + Good auto-saves, does so often. + Runs very smooth, no bugs, but load times to restart can be a bit long. + 6 unique charaters with unique abilities and upgrades (lock picker, tech guy, tough guy, fast lady, flexible lady and a robot).   CHARACTERS: Tech guy after upgraded can disable floor shock panels, security laser beams via terminals and video cameras directly (all can do so via terminals or with a tool). Tough guy can punch through walls and knock some guards out indefinetly if standing over them. Others can knock out guards via choroform and break walls via a acid if you picked one up or supplied one at the start when planning the missiong. Rocket can jump through security laser beams (others can disable via a usable tool if they have one) and go through vents in the wall. The other woman is fast and can go through floor grates to hide and the robot after upgraded won't be seen by cameras or guards cone fields of vision, can go over electrified floor panels and laser beams, but only interact with some basic things, can't use all tools. The lock pick guy is helpful, but you can find keys along the way or use a blow torch or bomb if you didn't select him as part of your team at the beginning. So LOTS of creativity in doing missions.   - Some features like vents can't be used until unlocking a certain character, so can't utilize some aspects in the first 8 levels (maybe its for replaying the game after beating it?). Wish you could select the skills to upgrade or unlock sort of like deus ex - human revolution style enabling you can pick your path rather than forced down a particular way. Also, some parts are fairly linear so is more of a puzzle with few paths or options.   NOTEWORTHY:  Its a bit slow paced (methodical planning), so if you lack patience this might not be of interest. In the later levels it takes lots of planning and precision.  Its addicting once you get a hang of it, fairly laid back but fun, unique and thought provoking!  The attention to detail is noticable and it is reasonably priced.  If you like the game, 'The Master Plan' this should be up your alley! Some small similarities to Doorkickers, Monaco and Marvelous Mistake too.  Hope you found this helpful, if unsure still check out the FREE DEMO-which has been out before the game was released and has four maps, so is enough gameplay for you to get into it or not. Also, Steam has a refund policy if under 2hrs or you can wait for a sale if in doubt.    9.5/10 based on price, creativity, stealth, fun and unique.  kc  Meatvideo.com  - Factory Farm Animal Cruelty, Why Vegan?",

            "review_text": "I give this a thumbs-up with some reservations.  It is an under-rated game in that there is a surprising lack of players for what is a competent (but sadly not exceptional) stealth game.   One thing that Crookz does very well is having a planning stage, where you can watch the guards patrol and examine the level in detail prior to picking a team and initial equipment to tackle it. This changes the feel of the game somewhat: Instead of a scrappy sneaky thief making things up as you go along, you are a master criminal crafting and then executing a devious master plan. Or something like that anyway.  You have several characters with mutually exclusive skills only some of which can come with you. In practice however, you almost certainly need the only character who can pick locks, the only character who can cut cameras, and the only character who can take out [most] guards. Item choices can partially mitigate this, but once you have found a team that fits your style, the other characters aren't really involved much.   The other big drawback to the game is that the skill development is not terribly exciting. For example, one character can sneak through light barriers. Except later on the higher security complex have laser barriers instead. Except that later on, your character gets a new skill allowing her to sneak through laser barriers as well. Yawn.   There are some challenge levels that are much harder -- and force you to use a particular set of team members and equipment. However, I did not have enough interest to want to continue once I completed the main campaign.  Overall, a decent game. But not an exceptional one. I bought it on sale, and suggest you do too.",

It took me a while to decide to buy it but it turned out to be one of the best buys I ever made on Steam. This game will always call you when you are looking for something to pass a few minutes. Then when you start to play again it will remind you how original and fun this game is ...  You can save when you want to. You can pause when you want to. You can play at your own pace. You can try different strategies. You can reload levels and give it another try on just a click of the mouse. And most important you can just have trying different plans.  Play this for a while and stop when you find something more flashy to play but this will always call you back.",
