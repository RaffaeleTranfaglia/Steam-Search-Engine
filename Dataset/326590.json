            "review_text": "For the nostalgic only. All of these games are horrendous by today's standards and have aged even worse than 90s FMV adventure games.  Each of these game takes a setup of half strategy game, half adventure game, and has different minigame portions. Each portion is terrible. There is no strategy to the strategic portion, the adventure portions are barely there and feel like they were written by 10 year olds, and the minigames are worse than 90% of any free Flash game on the internet.   For example, the minigames in Wings are full of anti-aircraft guns that you cannot avoid. A fatal hit can kill you in the first 5 seconds of a mission. One strafing mission saturates the area with anti-aircraft guns and it's impossible to not get shot down even if you ignore the targets and constantly move around, which is what the manual tells you is the way to dodge AA fire. And that's the BEST minigame of the bundle. Most of them just have you wait and push a button at the right time. One button push. That's it. End of minigame. They're shallow and short to the point of being Warioware levels, except you have to wait several minutes between games.  And yes, the waiting. The emulation is perfect in that the load times of 1980s computers is just as long. Every time you change a screen, be ready to sit through 5-15 seconds of loading. Need to hop into your spaceship to shoot down enemies? You have to wait 10 seconds to watch your guy go down an elevator, then another 10 seconds of him running down a corridor. Every time. Several times.  Then there's the emulation. You're given the choice between the Amiga versions and the PC versions. The problem is that the Amiga versions lightyears better looking graphics (PC versions are 4 color CGA most of the time, all the screenshots here are the Amiga versions) but the PC versions are lightyears better in the gameplay department. Most the gameplay in the Amiga versions is so bad it's virtually unplayable. For example there's no way to end your turn in Defender of the Crown (Amiga) other than invading a territory or holding a tournament. Attacking every turn before you're ready is suicide, so you have to end most of your turns with tournaments, which means sitting through the looooooong horrible joust minigame every turn. If your character sucks at jousting, your fame and leadership stats go into the toilet. The PC version has much better options and lets you end your turn manually, but the graphics are too ugly to look at (even for someone like me who was around in the 80s) and the PC speaker music beeps make your ears bleed. The other problem is that while the Amiga versions function, most of the PC versions do not. It's like they screwed up the DOS Box configurations. I could only get a single game's PC version to run.  AVOID unless you played all these back in the day and are really, really jonesing for a nostalgia fix. Just go watch 30 seconds of gameplay from something like King of Chicago or Sinbad on Youtube to see how truly bad these relics are. ",
