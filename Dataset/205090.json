            "review_text": "(This review does not cover EVERY single detail. Just the things that stand out)  The epic finale to the BIT.TIP series, Flux is certainly a must have for anyone who has experienced the full journey...if you can get past the game breaking bugs that is.  The first thing you may notice after the startup screen is the mouse lag, the thing thats killing this beautiful game. Attempting to play the first level without fixing will result in a very unsatisfying experience. Also, the game becomes somewhat impossible, as bouncing beats will go through the paddle! V-sync is able to be turned off through the options menu so your going to have to mess around with a few files. From what I have heard though (since this has not happened to me) the 1st boss becomes un beatable due to a crash.  Now that were done talking about bugs, lets talk about the game itself. Flux plays out in similar way to Beat, the 1st game. There are a few differences from Beat, the most obvious being that your paddle is on the right side of the screen. Other differences include colourless beats, avoid blobs, bonus beats and of course, the modes. Just in case anyone is confused, I dont mean mode as in different game modes. What I mean is the change of beat sounds and graphics as you continue to block beats. A new mode has also been introduced. 'Meta' (coming after Giga) will have a tune that makes it sound sort of victorious in a way when you block beats.  Levels now. There are 3 levels in this game. Epiphany, Perception and Catharisis. Each level has there own background, music and boss. Stage progression is different to Beat, in that you are no longer required to block rainbow coloured beats. Instead, checkpoints have replaced them. This means that failing to get out of nether mode will result in you being sent back to the last checkpoint, starting at hyper mode. Boss stages are always the final stage and each level will have differing fights. To avoid spoilers, I wont describe them although I will say that perceptions boss is the most unique.  So for a quick pros and cons sum up:  Pro:  Fantastic soundtrack Satisfying conclusion Checkpoints Great 8-bit graphics Some replayability  Cons: Bugs Epiphany and Catharisis bosses a bit too similar Bugs No public leaderboards Bugs   Rating this game, I would give it a 7/10 ",

It's very disappointing, because it's the finale to the series, and it just runs horribly compared to all the other BIT.TRIP games - even Runner2 does better. I really want this to just at least work and perform well at the very least... but alas, it looks like I'll have to pull out the Wii if I want that experience :/",
