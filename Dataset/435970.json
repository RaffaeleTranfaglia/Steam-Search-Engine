            "review_text": "I really like the game and wanted a hard copy, which was obtainable on a certian website. However one day the site vanished and I had to go with a illegal cracked version of it. Now the game is on steam and so I missed no time and bought it right away.  The game is very good. You have 3 pilots each with its own ship. It hard to decide since every ship exceeds in a certian terrain. You got everything from area defence to focussed laser attacks.   The game works as follows. You get coins by defeating enemies, which can be used to cast methods. There are multiple level of this. The final version of it is most of the time an entire screen clearing attack. With these methods you are able to knockback bosses and get a bit of time to recharge your method gauge.   Then you have the concept reactor, which is more of panic bomb/method gauge refiller.   If I could describe the game it would be like 'if revolver 360 and akashicverse had a small son this would be this game'.  Ofc the other games are not made by the same dev, but the overall similairty is there.  You have the matrix design from revolver 360 Re:actor and the method used in akashicverse.  The music is very good and the game offers a lot of difficulties to play with. The higher the difficulty the more fast paced the game gets. I can recommend this game to everyone having small experience in the genre up to the scorechasers that come from other shmups like crimzon clover world ignition or mushihimesama.",

Only negatives in my opinion is the sound effects in places lack punch and the background can be rather simplistic at times. BUT who cares about that when the screen it covered in bullets :)  Recommend it highly. ",
