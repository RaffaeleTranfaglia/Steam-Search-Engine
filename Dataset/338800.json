About the game: The most detailed, most cleverly designed and most entertaining strategy game even in 2015 :) But still needs some updates. Firstly, i can select my army with shortcut ( select army then press ctrl + number so you can select your army with this number ) but i can't reach them when i double press on it. And, after send my army to fort or lair, the shortcut disappears. (Edit: Devs fixed it. Thx Enlight) Also there is no shortcut for buildings. It would be great if some buildings has shortcuts like Mage Tor. Second, the rain sound is so loud and occurs frequently. It's annoying sometimes. (Edit: Devs fixed it. Thx Enlight)  Thanks a lot developers for this masterpiece. Actually a lot more things to be done but hope to see them in SEVEN KİNGDOMS 3!",

Now it's back with HD graphics, so even though my current monitor is over twice the resolution of the old monitor I played it on, it still looks great. The gameplay is simple, there are lots of detailed ancient cultures to choose from (as well as the dreaded Fryhtan aliens/monsters), and overall it runs well. I definitely recommend it if you like RTS games.",

So now that is out of the way on to the review. This is simply one of the best rts games ever made because it is realitivly simple to learn but VERY hard to master plus there is a wide choice of cultures to play as plus a fair amount of fryhtans to play as. The replayability is almost infinate because of the random generated campaign, the scenarios, and the scenario creator. In conclusion I definatly recommend this game for the price.  Now in all fairness their is one big negative right now and that is the optimization of this version. There is quite a bit of lag everytime you open a menu inside a game and also very rarley just at random times the framerate can drop as low as like 10 frames or just freeze for a second.",

I have never played with others online but i would think it would be a blast from the spy and trading part. overall i would give it a 8/10",

This game was made by a small team, and it shows. No click-attack option. Insanely slow infanty movement.  The utter lack of mines. I mean. I played a scenario match. It stated 'mines are what will grant you victory' or something like that. I found 1 freaking mine in that entire map. It didn't grant me victory.  What will grant you victory? A good general, fort turrets, and a bunch of free labor for your forts.  This was fun to play strictly for nostalgia, but there is no good reason whatsoever for this price.  WAIT FOR A SALE",
