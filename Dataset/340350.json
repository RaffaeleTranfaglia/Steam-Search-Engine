It would be better with voice chat but you can use TeamSpeak. If you like Star Trek this is the game for you. Teamwork is a must. If your on a good ship with a good crew nothing is better.   P.S. The DLC is just actually buying the game. The free version is just the demo (which is still fun). You can also play on your Iphone or Android and the players playing on Mobile can play on the same ships as the players on PC and Mac.",

            "review_text": "Quintet is an excellent game that allows multiple players to command different parts of a single combat spaceship. It would be the perfect game for very large gaming guilds to use to face off against each other, since you only need one ship for every five players, meaning computing power could be dramatically reduced for the same number of players. Despite its simple design, it has very complex underlying systems that take a great deal of skill to utilize to their full potential while still being very forgiving to newcomers who do not yet fully understand how the systems work.",

Also it seems to only want people on controller and screw over the keyboard and mouse. If you put something on pc it should be very keyboard friendly. I don't see any of the positive feedback for this game. Bad design with no idea how to play. It would fly back in the DOS age of games. But this is 2015 where more is expected.",

I can only assume this was popular once, and I also assume the developer(s) used this game to project themselves into the gaming industry - in which case bravo. This game is simple, but well formatted. Lacks a lot of content, but has a lot of ships.   I dunno, great for a LAN party if people still do those, but it's basically shoot each other until you're bored.",

You pick between several crew positions of a ship comparable to the Enterprise and fly about blowing stuff up. That is all you do. The tutorial is hidden, the interphase is hideous and there's no reason to do anything. There is no salvage, no missions, not even an end goal. Just blow stuff up. Even the blowing up of stuff isn't very interesting as your aim wavers and you go so fast. I wouldn't recommend for more than half an hour or so.",

Pros: Fun with friends  Runs on any PC made in the last 10 years Unique gameplay lots to do Cons: Only ok by your self More people need to play this game ",
