            "review_text": "So, I checked the game out yesterday. The game is one of those semi-roguelike basebuilders, not that different from Prison Architect or Banished. However, compared to those titles, the game is quite shallow. You generally deal with money, power and oxygen. Money comes from residents and visitors, power comes from solar panels and is used by components on your ship, and oxygen is generated by some of these components and flows through your ship depending on the status of your doors.  And for just that, the game is quite easy. Getting a net profit is not that hard, and getting power consists mainly of building lots of solar panels. Oxygen is easily managed with air locks.  The only real problem comes from random events (of which there are not that many it seems, I got some of them multiple times in my playthrough) and meteors. You eventually research equipment to deal with that. Until then you have a cycle of buildup -&gt; damage -&gt; people die -&gt; buildup.  To make things interesting there is research, but there are only 7 or so subjects which do not offer more in-depth mechanics. The game suffers from the same problem I had with Banished. After a while the real challenge is out of it and you can just expand until everything eventually crumbles apart. On my second try, at took me 1,5 hours to build every facility there is, net 2k each day and I did not have to care about asteroids or supernova's. Getting the last achievement would only consist of me walking between my pc and the couch to check for random events and otherwise let the game run at max speed.  Add to that the fact that the user interface is functional but a bit weird, and that the game lacks explanation. Yes, I think pointing out after the tutorial that 'the hand-holding comes to an end here' is very clever, but I could not find a way to use the stairs to actually build a second floor. The game just 'lacks', it lacks content, it lacks challenge, it feels like an early access game with way too less stuff to do.  Is it worth the money? Well I got 3,5 hours of minimal fun and I feel like I've done everything there is to do. Since the game cost me 5 euros, it was not a complete waste. But I don't think the game is good by any means, maybe a 5/10 for effort and only considering the low price.  You want something like this? Get Prison Architect. Maybe Banished. Or Dugeon Keeper. Or Evil Genius. Just not this game.",

I can see it being addictive once you learn how to play (which isn't that hard).   If the devs continue to update the game and fix up bugs, I can see this being a great game.  If it is worth the buy to you is up to you. It is buggy, which is expected in alpha, but nothing is game breaking so far (I haven't play too much, obviously).",

            "review_text": "At the moment it has its bugs. You try to run a space station but some advice, trying to build multiple floors bugs out, have to many residents and robots the ai crashes and then nothing is maintained so your station dies, and never build the fusion generator in a room that has oxygen. So have two engineering rooms. For no oxygen means fires are instantly put out. I would let the game sit for a few updates before it is more playable.",
