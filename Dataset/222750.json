The games are easier to handle and the campaign changes its format. All this without damaging the strategic content that made the studio's lust. The wannabe soldier will be happy to find hundreds of available units, and it will be time consuming before you can master everything during online games. The players really fond of change might regret the seriousness of the graphics and interface.Hard to learn and tough to play well, this game will attract only the hardest-core RTS player, the kind who cares about realistic combat and deep strategy. This is a game that will repay effort with success, but many will find it too much effort for not enough payoff.Wargame: AirLand Battle is a great game for those that enjoy realism in the planning and execution of skirmishes and battles. It will certainly present a challenge to those used to diving straight in and getting to grips with the nuances of the games with little effort. This is definitely a game that requires your full attention from the get-go and will provide lasting fun through the campaigns and into the multiplayer component.The RTS genre will be alive and kicking until the day they stop making games like this one.",

Even the management of saved games in single-player is terribly implemented, and leaves you feeling like you wasted an entire evening, when you discover that the game only overwrites your save, without giving you any save history to go back to. Single player should really be RTWP, because the AI has the tremendous advantage of being able to simultaneously command all units, to the extent that I have seen it command 10 gunships to move around the invisible engagement circle of my AA units as I moved them forward. Ridiculous. The AI also cheats terribly, such as being able to take control of sectors within three seconds of start, and deploying with more points than it actually has.  I regret this purchase. It might be great for multi-player, but they shouldn't promote the single-player aspect at all.",

Well to start the AI is rather dumb so to keep it in the game it has unlimited resources.   I set up a nice defensive position and murdered the AI to no end rarely losing a single asset. In the end I had shot every round and went through all my assets and the AI was still coming. You basically race against the clock to capture areas which may suit some people, but if you like to absolutely crush everything the enemy has you wont be able to in this game.   If they removed the timers and constrained the AI's resouces it would be a game I would highly recommend. I just dont care for it in its current form.",

You can beat the AI by basicaly 'rushing' into sectors and flooding them with units, but the AI can and does cheat and it's that part that of the game along with the timer that just frustrates.

The learning curve may be a little steeper than, say, Company of Heroes, but it's worth learning. The graphics are excellent, and I even have to say the audio is great.

            "review_text": "Too many units to choose from, it's almost imposible to use them all. Many of each: Logistics, Recon, Tanks, infantry, IFVs, Helocopters, Tank destroyers, ATGM, and of course planes. (yes lots of artillery too) If you're game to play war: keep your supply lines secure, Anti air close to cover, infantry supported/ supplied, planes in safe airspace, and tanks with the ammo and fuel to push. It's not about winning it's how you fight, you can loose while making your opponents sweat for every inch. Win a battle through attrittion or embarress your oppenent by breaking through their lines with outdated T-34s. Destroy countless M1a1 Abrams with the Su25 frogfoot mi-28 Havoc, or the famous A10 Thunder bolt and AH-64 Apache. It's your choice what kind of army you will put together, their is more than enough freedom in deck building. You can even try you luck fighting the mighty Soviet Union as Canada or even Denmark. Enough hellfire missiles, cluster bombs, napalm, and rockets to go around.  This game plays itself out as a survival guide to 21st century warfare, every lost soldier should be a painful lesson. Nothing should be used as expendable and preserved to the best of your ability. The learning curve is steep (for some), once and if you learn to play, winning comes with careful and consistant play. Don't feel disheartened if your first few games your defence collapses to overwhellming force, or your push comes to bittering stall when your tanks run out of gas. Which become stranded easy targets for defending Atgm or attack Helocopters. Keep your recon well positioned to spot those sneaky delta force which could go un-noticed behind your lines with an airborne drop from quick Blackhawk helocopters. If you choose to learn from your mistakes you will be rewarded for your patience and quickly become tactful in your thoughts.  Ranked mode is competetive at 1v1 level and Teams can be as well, however only if you prearrange for the ladders. Easy to make friends hard to find competent mates. Can play casual matches from 1v1 - 4v4 or even up to the crazy huge 10 v 10 mode. 10v10 is good to learn on, as you just need to try to win each engagement, or not collapse under pressure. Attrition can set in fast, make sure you have supply nearby. Overall, the game's multiplayer is solid. Keeps me coming back for more destruction.  War is ugly and Wargame gives you a beautiful way to play war.",

(anyway RIP world in conflict online)  The purpose of this is that; if your teammates commanding tanks or Infantry and they busy on killing the enemy hostile, capturing command points in the battle ground, As teammate, your job is to protect or support them with Artillery, Attack helicopter and Fighter Aircraft for air strike fire support.  player able to used 'symbol communication' (Requests Menu)  The Requests Menu contains a number of requests that can be sent to your teammates.  Many of the requests require the player to select a location, for example; select the position where the artillery should be placed. The other players will then see an icon on that specific location.  Requests Menu is an extremely powerful and effective way of communicating with other teammates.

While the singleplayer portion could be improved upon a bit more and not be so restrictive with the time frame (I'd enjoy bidding my time against a hard opponent), the multilayer is where it shines the most.   In the original Wargame I've played quite a bit of multiplayer but it didn't captivate me that much as it was restricted to only 4v4 on rather small maps. In this one they've added a 10v10 map (only 1 so far, hopefully more will come) and at times it can get incredibly chaotic and tense. This is where I've had the most fun so far.   To top that is using your own custom Decks (army builds), finding the best combinations for the majority of situations and watching how effective or ineffective your deck is. Even when loosing I never really felt bothered, it only opened a new window on how I could create a new deck by learning on what happened during battle.   I fully recommand this game, even if you are new to Wargame, or to large scale RTS in general, this is a good game to start with. Endless posibilities, endless fun.   However, remember that this is not your usual RTS, there is no base building.

I regret asking a friend for this one during Christmas because it is nearly dead, if I could go back and get Red Dragon I would in a heartbeat. Besides that I love every part of this game, being a military nut I love the depth this game has and how accurately it depicts the growth of weaponry for a cold war that got a bit hotter. Retaining things like small arms development and changing things that do not fit the timeline. The deck system is a favorite of mine since I love creating my own decks in card games and making something unique that can be tweaked to perfection. This is my first military RTS so I cannot give opinions on most of the gameplay, but the idea of a 1-10v1-10 really makes me feel like I'm controlling joint combined arms operations in World War III.

Dont get me wrong I love the concept of a Cold war rts but its VERY poorly executed in this game. Let me provide examples: 1. Special Forces are completely unrealistic as they are apparently (according to the game) Indestructable to Tanks, Napalm, Arterly, and other Infantry( with the exception of other spec ops) 2. Recon makes no sense whatsoever as the Spetsnaz VMF (a two man squad) has a higher chance of being spotted than a squad of five Razvedka division. Also on the topic of recon lets talk about the broken recon helicopter system as the statistics make no sense whatsoever. This can be easily shown through the optics section of a units description (in this case Iâm using the Soviet mi-2 as an example) the mi-2 has optics of very good but how is one to compute the words very good into actually game play? I don't know,as it does not give the player a accurate sight listing (ex: optics up to 10,00 meters etc) 3. Helicopter spam: This is probably the most annoying flaw about this broken game as this happens IN EVERY SINGLE GAME people can simply spam helicopters (and not uses any strategy while doing it) and literally destroy everything while doing (including anti aircraft) 4. Anti Aircraft : The aa system algorithm in this game is surely the worst Iâve seen in my entire life as certain planes are literally untouchable by anti aircraft again let me provide more examples from the game. In a particular match I had 6 zsu-23 afghanskii which altogether have a fire rate of 5,454r/m and a Tunguska system right beside them. then a lone f -14 tomcat comes along and take NO DAMAGE from the Tunguska and the six afghanskis and as to be expected this is continuous from game to game no matter what aa system I use on either pact of nato it will rarely take down aircraft. 5. Forest Combat : fighting in a forest in this game is being realistic as it basically becomes like harry potter. Basically a squad of 40 motostrelki disappears magically from my 60 US marines, and when I do get sights back on them is says âno clear sightâ which is absolutely ridiculous given that the forest aren't very large in most maps. Final Verdict: Only but this game if its ion sail never pay full price for it as its utter garbage to anyone who has respect for this genre of games.

It's a very different game from the RTS's that I have played in the past, and it's a great game because of it.  Hardware required: So I played this game a few weeks before building my first gaming rig (I honestly could not wait, I was watching gameplay vids every day), and I was using Intel HD2000 graphics instead of HD3000 graphics that it suggests and it ran just fine, sure it didnt look nearly as impressive, but the gameplay is very fun reguardless.

Multiplayer is very fun, but there is a very steep learning curve. And while on the topic of multiplayer: by now most of the community has moved on to Red Dragon (which I'll talk about after this), so it can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 40 to actually get a game going. That being said, there are perks to having a small community; it's great seeing people you know consistently on, and trolls and AFKs get blacklisted fairly fast. After a couple weeks of multiplayer, you will most likely know and recognize everyone by name and rank. My friend and I still immediately quit lobbies when we recognize someone who outmatches us by a large margin, and we kick the trolls.    Now, about Airland vs. Red Dragon... Having played a decent amount of both Airland Battle and Red Dragon- the lattergenerously gifted to me by someone I met on Airland Battle!- I can confidently say that Airland Battle is the better of the two.   There are simply several oppressive gameplay mechanics present in Red Dragon that don't exist as much in Airland. In Red Dragon, air power is severely weakened, artillery is way too strong, and infantry is near useless (several niche positions notwithstanding; scouts, sappers). There are several improvements in Red Dragon, of course. The menu is better, there is a naval aspect to the game, and there are 'Coalition' options, as well as a couple + nations. Is that worth buying? Not really, not when 90% of the units in Red Dragon exist in Airland, and not when the gameplay is so frustrating.   Eugene is a great developer who releases free DLC. Unlike EA, I gladly pay for their games, instead of pirating.   Buy Airland Battle- you won't regret it.",

Euguen Systems put in every little detail that makes every unit seem and act differently. Its not like some RTS games where you build a base and spawn units and if they get killed you can spawn in new units. No, here its as realistic as it gets. You can only bring out whatever units you have on reserve, and once you lose them, you lose them. The campaign was only okay. It was a little short and it didn't go as far out as I would have liked. The 10 Vs. 10 multiplayer battles in the game were just breathtaking. Just the fact that it was possible is what really got me the most. While its always great if you have friends to play with. For a good challenge, switch your interface to NATO mode, and hit some random servers. For an overall total I have to give this game a solid 8,5 out of 10. The only reason I say that is because some of the units sometimes get stuck on pretty much nothing, and the campaign was short and didn't offer very much of a challenge.",

It takes itself as seriously (and plays a bit like) the Close Combat series, with clean real-time tactical RTS gameplay backed by one of the best turn-based stratigic planning I have seen in a mixed strat/tact game.   During RTS play, it does seem to fall in between squad level and platoon level, and not in a well thought out way, but in an awkward way. The UI could also use some updates, for example, there is a concept of cover, but no way to tell that a unit is covered or not. Or your infantry comes with jeeps (or APCs, helos, etc.), but you can't control how they start, so when defending, I can lose huge amount of infantry before I can get them to evac their trucks. I feel like a pause option would solve a lot, but only for single player.   Overall, this is a fun game for serious players. Expect to lose quite a bit until you get an understanding of the machanics, which took me about 4-6 hours.",

Infantry, tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters, airplanes, and in the next game, BOATS! This game just screams autism. So if you're autistic and like semi-realistic and modern military games, then this is the right video game for you.  This isn't your typical gook click 300 APM minimum required strategy game where you practice the same build orders over and over. Nothing is static, there's a myriad of factors that have an impact on gameplay. Yes, it's possible for your WW2 era T-34s to destroy modern Abrams at point blank from the right angles. If you fly a helicopter over an urban area, it's likely to get shot down by small arms fire, so you can reenact Black Hawk Down, especially since Black Hawks are an actual ingame unit.  Over all this is a great game. Don't just take my word for it though.

Wargame: Airland Battle takes the RTS genre and makes it much more tactical based with large, brimming maps with obvious terrain hundreds of units and is brimming with details that will literally make your head pop with just how much is packed into it. I was in a tank fight and I had noticed that one of my tanks had an orange warning on it that said 'Targetting Computer Reset' and then a timer next to it. This was damage that had been done to my tank that was being fixed by the crew...it's little things like that that took me my surprise.  The graphics are good for an RTS, you won't get blown away by particle effects or anything but for a game that you can lay down hundreds of units in a multiplayer game it was obvious why they kept shadows and particles down a bit. That being said though the game still operates well and does have beautiful graphics, battles are engaging and look like they should feel with missiles, rounds and tracers brimming from one side to another.  The 'deck' building element that they like to call it is also a fantastic addition to this game, allowing you to make your own customizable armies from hundreds of units makes for a unique and enjoyable experience, especially in online play.   However, I do have one gripe about this game and that is the single player campaign. Where Skirmish mode and Multiplayer shine with beauty the campaign is lack luster and feels rushed, doing 20 minute skirmish after 20 minute skirmish gets old real quick.  However, don't let that last bit deter you, the replay ability for the skirmish and multiplayer mode is endless with continual differences in the lists that you run and the opponents you face. Wargame: Airland Battle takes the RTS genre in a much needed change of pace and pulls it off with beauty....beautiful beautiful destruction.  9/10",

        {
            "review_text": "Backstory:  I grew up playing strategy games such as Command &amp; Conquer and Starcraft, but after a while I grew tired of the arcade-y gather resources, build a base, spam a unit, upgrade, repeat archetype. I came to want a game with some more strategy than spamming a good unit. So, I told my friends the kind of game I was thinking, no base building, units that don't have unlimited fuel and ammo, and more sophisticated combat than 'this does more damage than this' and they said, 'you mean Wargame?' Thus, I bought the game.  Getting into the Game:  First off, there is the singleplayer, which is basically skirmishes with the nigh mindless AI. It's not much, even with a campaign of sorts, but it isn't a bad place to get used to the game and test things like new decks before you start playing multiplayer as the AI does know how to defend itself and keep the pressure on you. Next up is the multiplayer; unfortunately, with as few players as this game often has, most players will be either very good pros who've been playing this game a long time or almost completely new players to the game giving it a test. So, chances are unless you find someone willing to help you (whom I have seen a lot of; the community is typically fairly friendly), you'll have a lot of games were your allies can't pull their weight or your enemies have super-sneaky infantry and fire-support for them in every bush you don't want them to, making getting used to the game in multiplayer a difficult but not insurmountable challenge for the unseasoned.  Gameplay:  The first thing that sets Wargame apart from most RTS games is the realistic attempt at mechanics. Units are often very specialized for countering certain other units, and there are often counters for those units. I could go into great depths on the handling of the units and the importance of anti-armor ability, high-explosives, range, accuracy, stealth, supply vehicles, command vehicles, capturing sectors, radar AA, anti-radar planes, bombers, fighters, helicopters, manpad infantry, anti-tank guided missiles, artillery, recon, maintaining a good screen against enemy attack, and so on, but that belongs in a manual. For now, I'll leave it at large numbers of units not being a good stratagy, because an intelligent enemy can simply pick your guys off out of range and sight with ease. Positioning, recon, and being ready to kill whatever comes your way are typically what win the game.  Decks:  The replacement of base building and research in contemporary games is the building of decks. You can create a deck in the deck editor to your liking (balanced approaches typically work best, but unique strategies have their place) and use it in any match that isn't campaign, and start with every unit you will be able to use that match at your disposal, only limited by the deployment points gained from capturing sectors with command vehicles. Do not be discouraged by the sheer choice of units: you can limit your selection by country, date, and general combat philosophy (mechanized, motorized, marine, airborne, armored, etc.)  Vs. Red Dragon  Of due note is this game's sequel, Red Dragon. If you find the need for a lot of variety and a large playerbase, you might want Red Dragon instead. However, Red Dragon, while it adds more content, is broken in gameplay compared to Airland Battle. Simply put, Red Dragon is what happens when you put late 1990s top-shelf equipment in a game modelling the late 1980s; it isn't a perfect fit, and game balancing suffers.  Pros +Solid gameplay. Nations are well balanced, while still being diverse in technologic advancement +Sweden. Sweden, a neutral, often forgotten country in warfare, has a lot of great strengths and perplexing weaknesses +Intelligence, preparation, and careful management over nigh-mindless spamming. Chance for good, in-depth strategy to develope over what often becomes stack-wiping battles +Diversity. Plenty of ways to win and get a sneaky one-up on your enemy  Cons +Aging graphics. Not bad by any means, but certainly not the shiniest toy on the block +Few people. Everyone pretty much has no idea what they're doing or knows the game like the back of their hand",
