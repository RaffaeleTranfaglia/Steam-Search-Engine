            "review_text": "A modern retouching of the game North &amp; South. The original came out around the time that I was born and I remember playing it often with my dad and uncles when I was very young. Much of the gameplay is very similar, though a few aspects have been modified or added to the game.  The most obvious change is the graphic quality of the game. As it was always a game based on humor, the new graphics work well and do not detract from the game in any way.  The economic system still works mostly the same as it used to, owning two separate train stations allows a train to go between them at the end of your turn to generate gold for your treasury. However, now instead of acquiring a new unit after filling your safe, you have a store that you can purchase from. This store includes new units (half the price that they were in the original), protection from Indian and Mexican attacks, protection from storms, and additional ammunition for your cannons in battle.  Combat seems to have been overhauled and simplified, however, which is my main complaint with the game. No longer do you bounce between using direct control over your units trying to outmaneuver your opponent, now it's simply giving commands with the mouse as if it were an RTS. This removes a significant amount of the skill that played a massive role in the original. Taking a fort has changed as well. Instead of, for lack of a better term, playing a 2D platformer beat-em-up to get from one side of the fort to the other to raise your flag, you now sit in a single position hiding behind cover and popping up to shoot enemies until none of them are left. These systems are not neccessarily bad, but may steal a little bit of the nostalgia from the old game if that's why you picked it up.  All in all, the game is a simple, board game like game that can be played locally against a friend. I recommend it as a fun, casual experience, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for something hardcore.",

A good game when you want something to break the long sessions of bigger more complex games. 3€ really well spent.  P.S. I really like kick the northerners as I am a really fan of Dixie land.",

            "review_text": "I must admit. I had much higher hopes about this game...  But I must warn you before you buy it. The difficulty is easy enough for a two year old to continue winning... There's no competition what so ever. :/ And the length of this game... Wow... Don't get me started. A game lasts about 3 min, unless you decide to give the enemy a chance, and drag the game out. But what's the point?  I could've spend my money much better this time.  I hope they do implement some more features, to maybe make the game abit harder, and maybe make a game last just a tad longer. Because this is ridiculous.  Eitherway, it's a bit like the old Amiga 'North and South' game. Although it's much shorter, much easier and well... The mini games isn't really that fun.  I wouldn't recommend the game, but then again.. If you don't know the old North and South, and like this type of games, then buy it. If you know the old game, and wanna keep that precious memory, then DO NOT BUY!  Because this game will ruin any good memory you had of the amiga version of this game.  I'll give it 2/10.  Only for the graphics and well... Graphics and the idea.    TL;DR - Don't buy it. Save your money. It's too easy, too short and not really that fun. 2/10 is all I'm gonna give it.",

I do like how battles take place in real time and sometimes you get to shoot enemies. Overall, it's not good enough to get a thumbs up. Additional game time past 15 minutes is strictly for cards.
