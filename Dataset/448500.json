The First Level's Difficulty is fine, but what I though were the checkpoints didn't let me respawn when I lost my health, but they always brought me back when I fell so I don't know if the checkpoints are confused about what they're meant to do or if they only let you respawn on falling down a pit.  But it's a pretty fun game and I wanted to keep going through the level every time I ended up dying.  Graphics are Really nice and pixely and they sit well with me.  Overall I'd recommend it, it's a pretty fun game and for 4 dollars, it's enough to keep your attention for a little while.  However I recommend d-pad mode, the normal mode the game was made with in mind is highly boring and is really not a good mode to start with if your just starting the game.",
