    "description": "Krinkle Krusher is an action castle defense game where you cast elemental spells to defend your kingdom from twisted and hungry creatures called Krinkles. After several generations of peace, they happen to come back exactly when the Ancient Tree bears its first fruits in centuries, and of course a cake was made from it.",
