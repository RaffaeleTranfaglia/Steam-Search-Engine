No blood, no zombies, no violence, no boring cliches that all other developers are using nowadays.  Finally a game where the focus is on cooperation. You may build your city together with a bunch of friends. There is no 'real' pvp in the game. Of course you may compare yourself to others in many ways. But that is really pointless here. This is a peaceful manager game.  Yes, there is an in-game currency that you can buy from devs. But thats reasonable. Of course they have to earn some money do keep up the good work. You wouldn't work for free either. Would you? Also an important feature is that you are allowed to earn that currency in the game so easily. So you may still play without paying a single cent without any restrictions. Very nicely balanced. Still I advise to back the devs a bit. :) They deserve it.  The support is very helpful, and they are acting fast, when you contact them. You may link your steam based account and your phone account to a single shop. That way you may visit your business even if you are not close to your PC.  I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes to chill out in a peaceful environment.",

Yes, there are micro-transactions, but I have played the game for days without feeling the need to purchase anything extra. This game is so fun, though, that I would be completely fine spending a bit of money on it - I've had more enjoyment out of it than some Steam games I've bought for $20 or more!

Its a very addictive game, easy to learn how to play it and YES there is a cash system but as far as i played you can completely ignore it, you can use it to buy some cosmetic stuff or skip the production time but believe me, things don't take that long to be crafted. (at least thus far) I say: give it a go but be aware; this game can be very addicting. __________________________________________________________ Português (Br): Para ser honesto ...

É um jogo muito viciante, fácil de aprender como tudo funciona, e SIM existe um sistema de cash, mas ate aonde eu joguei você pode ignorar o cash completamente, você pode usá-lo para comprar algumas coisas como roupas ou pular o tempo de produção dos itens, mas acredite em mim, as coisas não levam tanto tempo para ser fabricadas. (pelo menos ate agora.) Recomendo dar uma chance, mas esteja ciente: este jogo pode ser muito viciante. ",

It's not something you'll spend hours a day playing, but it's great to kill a few minutes while you're waiting on something else, in the restroom, or just bored.  I prefer the Steam version to the Facebook version (FB was super laggy and had to be refreshed periodically) and this one feels more like what I'm used to on my phone, just with a bigger screen, and easier to play while still looking busy and not as if I'm definitely goofing off on my phone.",

Gamewise, it's a pretty standard shop simulator, but more forgiving than say Diner Dash. It may get a little grindy after a while, but then again all games do so.

It is a mobile game in the same style as Recettear, so the comparisons others have made are apt.  I have personally enjoyed the game though, as unlike Recettear it is best when groups work together for mutual benefit. The bonuses obtained through City guides are quite helpful, and they are free. In fact, the whole game can be played from free, though it takes some extra work to build up gems, the IAP. There are other F2P games that follow similar formuls, so in the end it comes down to fun, and I find the game enjoyable.  Pros: Working together in a group Free* Can be played in small increments or continous micromanagement, both styles of play supported Fun (subjective) Arenas (PvP) That Diablo feeling when you finally find or craft a legendary item.  Cons: Free* but spending some actual money helps. With that said, it is not too difficult to build a steady stream of free gold.  Can be incredibly difficult playing solo. Group play is pretty much a requirement. Group bonuses make the game more enjoyable and faster crafts  Some minor gripes - turning furniture only turns in two directions, not in all four Lack of avatar customization without high IAP - Similar to other games, but still sucks Missing some aspects that make Recettear so enjoyable - More shop customization, plyable missions",

First of all this game is FREE, not like Heroes re-gens at 14bucks it's fricking 0, micro transactions are meaningless you dont need to buy and more importantly the game doesnt ads or cut your gameplay to force you to buy.  The game does not require any stupid mobile game stamina that makes you play less than 20mins per day. The game is illimited.  The game is huge, you have ton of things to do, quests, crafts, management and it is smart and developped to be coop.  The game isnt unfair or selling fake content like all the others on market... In only 2 days i made up to 30 Millions gold just by playing normally... spending 0 real money and it is a good game to pass time, specially if you need to relax when you're down or like me, when you get mad on your speedrun training.

There are IAPs in this game, but I hardly think that would be unexpected. However, they are entirely unnecessary. I've been playing for three months now, and it hasn't got to a point where I'm bored or I feel stuck and can't progress. The in-game IAP currency (gems) are easily obtainable (over time), and all the important extra purchases for the game are made via gems.   The developer has been very responsive to making positive changes to the game, again in my opinion, although I'm not close to the max level yet, so I can't comment on the end game.

Yes, it does have microtransactions, but they seem to be entirely for speeding up the simulation. You can easily just go slow and steady and accomplish everything in the game regardless, so the cash shop is entirely for convenience, not necessity.

Yes there are some blueprints (used to craft items) that can be in cash packages, they look cool, but there is a free item that is just as good. Yes you can use cash to speed things up if you like but it does not unbalance the game at all.

You can earn premium gems by sending your heroes on missions, doing city raids every weekened, and you can sell any item you craft for permium gems.   Ok enough of the money stuff. It's free to play period, don't listen to the folks with 0.3 hrs on record that didn't bother to try out the best parts of the game. Or just downvote it because it's a FB/Phone game. The build here on Steam already has things implemented that are not on other platforms yet.   The devs are great, they listen to the comunity and keep us informed about what is going on. They are very responsive to any concerns and seek to solve problems quickly.   If you like crafting in MMOs this game is for you. You run a shop where you craft items to sell to heroes or to other players. You send your heroes on missions to gather items to craft with though not all items need them. You can fight other players in the arena if you like. Join a city and work with others to build your town up to unlock all the heroes and workers you need. Raid with your city weekly to earn premium gems and box keys. Browse the player market for good deals and resell for a profit.  The most important thing is to join a good city.

I mainly play PC games and don't own a mobile device, so I'm glad to see these types of games offered here on Steam.  The microtransactions don't have to be that painful, unless you are the type of completionist who cares about earning every gold star. You can gain a decent amount of free gems by playing the game co-operatively. After you reach level 15 in the game, (probably less than 24hrs of gameplay required), you can earn gems from other players using the global Trade House. The best use for early gems, is to get gold, any amount of gold that you gain can speed up your progress tremendously.  If you feel you can manage to reward the devs at Cloudcade a little for thier work, the Fountain of Gems offers 100 gems per day for 30 days, which seems the best deal at $9.99USD for 30 days. As I mentioned you can earn a Gold Star, if you manage to hire all 20 available workers. Sadly gaining that star will cost you close to $100USD for the two premium workers.  It's beneficial to be in a city by yourself for the first 20 levels or so, and then joining a mid-level city will give more advantages. Every city buiding gives some type of passive bonus, and an instant bonus when you invest in the building. The investment costs for a solo player are going to be much lower, which makes it much easier to take advantage of those bonuses.",

Send heroes on quests (which effectively are just timers and nothing else) to find out if the Random Number Gods will give you the resources you need to craft more items. Wait. Find out you didn't get the resources. Wait some more.  I've played for just over an hour, and for the first half-hour, there was very little waiting. The second half-hour was pretty much solid wait city. I like the fact that games like this are available for the PC, it's so much easier to click than tap. But this one is just not for me. It remains to be seen if I'll go back to it, but I don't think I will.",

It is FTP so I don't wanna judge it too harshly, I'm just saying that this 'game' is far better suited to facebook than steam.   Though since Greenlight is the worst cesspool since...ages now, I'm not at all surprised such a game slipped through and made it to the steam store (despite not belonging here at all).",

Its got story, good mechanics, cute/amusing characters, and no timers or microtransactions. Its a decent anime-style shopkeeping game that isn't some mobile cash-grab timer game.  I liked Recettear, so I tried to give this a shot, and it managed to lose my interest before even the minimum 5 minutes needed for a review had passed because I immediately had wierd response time issues, and there was 0 story introduction, just some lady who says 'Oh hey, here help me craft and sell stuff for no reason'.",
