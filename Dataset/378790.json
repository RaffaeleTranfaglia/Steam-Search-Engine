    "description": "We are currently planning an English release of Kagura Douchuuki! Kagura Douchuuki is a roguelike RPG where you control shrine maidens (miko) and battle against monsters. Dungeons are randomly generated, so the map layout, enemies, and items will be completely different with each play-through!",
