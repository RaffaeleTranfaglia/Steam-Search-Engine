            "review_text": "When I first saw this game, I mistook it for a shooting game, in the sense that you run around dodging the enemy while you fire at them from afar (The problems of not reading and looking at the game carefully!)   At first, it kind of felt hard, it wasn't easy getting your bombs to detonate right in front of your enemies' faces when both sides are moving. Your bombs are affected by your surrounding, which are in turn, affected by your bombs, your movements, and the enemies' movements. This surrounding of yours is very important because it will affect everyone's movement. You can drop absorbtion bombs which will compress the surroundings, dragging everything, bombs, enemies (and you!) into it like a black hole. You can even absorb them to yourself, (be careful of letting them touch your head! Your hitbox is in your head) causing them to follow you in a line and crushing each other. Spin around in a circle, and your enemy will ball up and crush each other to death (or be crushed by the surroundings)  It's hard to explain. I found this game fun because there's a slight tactic to it. Simply placing bombs at the enemy's location might not work, and you would have exploit the enemy's patterns and your own abilities to be able to blow it up. You can also do the tactic above, carefully compressing the space in the surrounding and forcing the enemy to be squished by the web or by each other.  Well, I liked this game and would recommend it for anyone who wants to try something new  Oh, and by the way Good luck on bullet hells. It's a Japanese game, of course your enemies will be firing at you from everywhere",

            "review_text": "Surprisingly innovative game, which is fun when investing a bit of time!  It need some time to get used to the game. It has some mechanics from a shoot'em'up, but not shooting on the players side. Instead some 'ripple graviational deformation' are created by bombs and 'inversion bombs'. The ripples are visualized with a dynamic grid.  Check the official webpage, as it contains some more explanation than the ingame help.  The initial 'ship' is a bit weak. Nevertheless with some experience it is possible to beat at least everything up to boss number 4, even with this ship. Tipp: use both weapons quickly one after the other while rotating the ship, therefore positioning the bombs close together.  One main shump mechanic is the move or get killed one, which applies strongly here. But as there are no long range weapons (at least the first upgradeable ones are not), it is necessary to get close to moving enemies. This is what makes up a lot of the fun of the game.  The enemies (I played up to boss 4) are all very nice, challenging, partly innovative. Graphics is ok, a bit generic, but practical, as it does not overfill with effects which are not directly linked to the game mecanics, as many other games have.  If you are not fixed to the standard move and shoot shoot'em'ups but want to try something a bit different, while still having some of the mechanics, I can highly recommed this game.",

            "review_text": "This is definitely NOT a shoot 'em up. There is no shooting involved, only laying down bombs. The upgrades that allow you to 'evolve' cost a ridiculous amount of points which are difficult to earn in the first place since your only weapon to start is a bomb that doesn't even do that much damage, making the game super slow and frustrating.",
