            "review_text": "Overall, I've enjoyed this game. I don't exactly remember when/how I got it, but I wanted to play a dungeon crawler, popped this one in, and was surprised by it.   From what I've collected, this game seems to have had a rocky history/start, but I can't really find anything major to gripe about it. I'd imagine major issues have since been patched by the time I played this game.  Attack of the Labyrinth is pretty basic and it can be beaten in about 80 minutes if you're experienced with the genre, slightly longer if not. It's hard to get a game over in this game because if you're decent at it and like to explore you'll either find a ton of 1UP's or be able to buy lots of them from the store. There are two endings that I'm aware of and the requirements to get the 'good' ending aren't that hard.  My only real gripe is that there's something weird going on with the achievements, namely that some people think one of them is outright broken, and that there are a couple whose unlock requirements are unclear. As I write this review there's no guide and no insight on the forum as to what's what. If you're looking for completion, I'd stay away from this one.  The game is a 'solid 5' on a 1-10 scale, to me at least.",

            "review_text": "A fun little fantasy twin-stick shooter. So far as I can tell, the classes aren't well balanced - range doesn't seem to be a major factor in the balance of attacks. As such, it's hard to beat the (free) unlimited range of the mage. You can kill things you can't even see, and with a high rate of fire, that really helps keep the screen clear in the direction you are moving.  The other classes seem to pale in comparison, but it is still a fun time.  The upgrades feel like a proper shmup, they are significant, but you lose them when you die. But the permanent upgrades give the game a slight RPG feel that is cool.  The game could use a couple of things that I think would have made it more fun:  1. A more gradual ramp-up of enemy difficulty and frequency. Basically you are getting random encounters with tons of monsters right out of the gate, and there doesn't seem to be anything stopping you from bumping into rather 'nasty' monsters in the very first parts of the very first level.  This isn't a flaw, by itself, but it seems like a missed opportunity to feel like you are gradually ramping up, which is common in shmups.  2. The game could use some 'sanctuaries'. The shops seems like the obvious choice, but it would be nice to have somewhere to go to think, count, and just look at your map for a few seconds.  These flaws are all minor, though, and the game achieves its goal very well, overall, I think.",
