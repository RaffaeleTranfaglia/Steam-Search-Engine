            "review_text": "The best zoo-tycoon game in my opinion. The WP series features heavily on realism, unlike the Zoo Tycoon series, although that series is good too. Animals look realistic, as are their AI behavior. It takes a while for babies to be born, unlike ZT where it apparently happens instantly. Food don't magically appear out of thin air to feed your animals. like in ZT. You need to place the proper facilities to make the food.  WP 2 also focuses more on those rare/unknown animals, unlike ZT where they feature mostly well known/popular animals. I like this idea, because it lets people who play this game learn about animals they've never seen/or read about before. For example, there's the frilled sharks from the marine expansion. I doubt many people who aren't shark fans would know what they are.   The map isn't really set up like a grid (ZT again). You simply 'paint' the paths along the ground for your customers to walk on, which makes your zoo look more realistic if you're using stone or dirt paths for instance.   One thing I do like in ZT over WP2 though is setting up your habitats for marine animals. It's very easy to do in ZT but I find it frustrating to do the same in WP2.  Both zoo series are good, but if you want more realism in a zoo game, then WP2 is the way to go. With 150+ animals, realistic AI, along with loads of plants and attractions, etc, however, you should buy it anyway.",

            "review_text": "This game has many issues that prevent it from being fully enjoyable. In fact, had I known about these issues, I wouldn't have bought the game. The main issue is that the expansions do not act as DLC. They act as their own seperate games. They show up individually in your library. The base game does not contain missions or maps from the expansions. In order to play with those, you have to start up that specific expansion. However, the animals from the expansions seem to show up almost randomly between each other. For example, the base game appears to have almost all of the animals (fish, dinos, dragons, etc) but appears to be missing certain specific species. The expansions have the same issue; having certain species and not others. You can fool around in the program files and condense most of everything into the base game but you will still be missing stuff. And, I must point out, the animal color customization button in the base game doesn't work.  As for the actual game itself, it is alright. There are aspects of it that are annoying (each employee has their own individual giant fugly tower, there isn't much variety in animal enrichment items, there aren't many items for guests, etc) but overall if you're looking to play something mindless for a while, Wildlife Park 2 isn't the worst choice. It is certainly not as enjoyable as Zoo Tycoon, however, and if you're looking for an exciting, challenging simulation game, I would not choose this. ",

Perhaps this wouldn't be a problem if help was avalible but the forums don't seem to have many threads about this issue, and also seems to be dead since 2014. I'm really disappointed :'( I'll probably keep the game incase I figure something out, but until then this game is completely broken for me.",
