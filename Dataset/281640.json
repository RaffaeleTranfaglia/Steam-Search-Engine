            "review_text": "Superb improvement over an already decent original. The combat is more interesting with a greater variety of both allied and enemy units and more in the way of battleground terrain and structures. The storyline is also improved over the original and the better quality of writing is almost instantly apparent. The training tent is also not so much of a white elephant and now periodically contains training puzzles which boost reknown on completion. The somewhat boring travelling sections have also been given an overhaul and creating a good balance between fighters and clansmen is no longer just random as clansmen can now be trained into fighters at the training tent. These fighters will consume twice as much food as clansmen and clansmen will now actively scavenge making them more than just the dead weight they were previously.   It's certainly an advantage to have played the original (and the final save from your previous adventure can be imported) as continuity is maintained with regard to storyline and base mechanics. But despite this BS2 remains a better and more well rounded game than the first making it a must-buy for story driven TBS fans. The only valid reason I can see for not getting hold of BS2 is if you absolutely hated the original - and why anyone would have is beyond me.",

            "review_text": "The Banner Saga 2 it's more of a continuation than a sequel, but the improvements that this game has over the previous one make this game incredibly enjoyable. I know some people found their experience on the past game quite challenging or even frustrating but in TBS2 trust me that you will enjoy this ride like you have never ever enjoyed a Turn based strategy game.  Improvements in common gameplay! The caravan system has been vastly improved, now those lazy clansmen actually bring much necessary food/supplies to you! By hunting and foraging and thus keeping up your survavility rate! This allows you to do something that in TBS1 would be unimaginable and that is Purchasing Items from the market! Can you believe it? Well neither can I and that's just awesome!  There are awesome items that are worth every renown point. Also random encounters generate higher morale stats which was something very rarely heard in TBS1.  Also it has as you begin the game, it explains to you with simplicity and in great detail on how the game works and how each thing works and why is it there and what it means. It's just like they took everything from TBS1 and made it a million times better and added a bunch of new cool awesome stuff.  Improvements on heroes! Speaking of which, now your heroes can reach level 10! And whilst in TBS1 it costed a lot of renown, now it's much cheaper. PLUS! they gave us the introduction to new perks! Perks can make your hero into a tank, regenerate will power or armor or simply become a whirlwind of death. Heroes can also obtain a new ability once they reach level 5/6! And this is fantastic as it brings more variations and new strategies to play with.  Art Department: As expected of Stoic, TBS2 explodes to unbelivable levels of Awesome and beautiful when it comes to their art department, If you thought that TBS1 was beautiful just you wait until you see this one! The journey overall it's more epic, you see more of the world and it makes you feel like you really are a part of an animated fantasy film! But in this case of a different piece of narrative and art.  The music it's beautiful and if you are fan of game/movie music I highly recommend to get the soundtrack, because it just nails it and gets 'them muh feels!' I would even compare the combination of both to a Jame Cameron movie in the sense of complete immersion.  The Narrative it's way more smooth, it gets more interesting and intense. Build up from the 1st game is given fruits on this one and naturally the gae keeps branching on it. We learn more about the world of TBS and it's people. Also the new Godstones are bautiful and interesting.  This game has more replayable value than you can imagine, specially due to all of the branching that it has 'not only depending on how you finished the first game' but also on the decisions that you take during this one.  Even if the story is sort of lineal, it is really an RPG since your decisions really take a weigh and reward in this game.  It also left me wanting for more because it was awesome, and the new animation segments are great! Seriously, maybe you think its going to be hard but this game it's actually easy BUT! it can also be challenging if you wish it to be so! It also has many surprises depending on what you decide.  So yeah! Go for it because it was worth every penny.",

            "review_text": "It's the original but better in almost every way except for the story, which gets kinda lame at the end. And that's just because it's the second in a trilogy, so expect the story to be better in the third game.   The design and music are improved and much better integrated this time around, and there's not as much random empty space that sticks out either. More animated cutscenes are nice, and more interesting characters are always a plus. Shame some of the original's characters and plot threads get almost no exposure, even though i thought they would have gotten their arcs in this one.  Raven segments aren't as much fun as Skogr segments but it's not a problem.  You can also get Eirik to train a war bear. So that's cool.",

If you like good turn based aesthetic strategy games then buy it already! ",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I was a huge Banner Saga 1 fan, my only complaint being it was too short. I have not finished this yet but it seems like it will be longer as much as I have played.  Okay, on to the review.  HOLY ♥♥♥♥. This game improves so much upon the mechanics from the previous installment. There are more levels! One slight pet peeve of mine is that now leveling takes a good bit less renown, so I feel like I wasted a lotta renown in my last run, but thats okay. There are new 'talents' which you unlock after maxing out skills, and puts those excess skill points from more levels to use. You can level to level 10 now. That about covers leveling.  Camp and markets are largely unchanged. Dialogue seems a lot more tense and enjoyable in this game, which is saying something.  Anyways, so the combat system is as far as I can see mainly unchanged, but its been spiced up. There are barricades which people can take cover behind or attack to destroy. Core mechanics remain quality, and some exciting new abilites are popping up with the new recruits.  I have not encountered the new race but I hold out hopes they will be great. Will update this later when I know more.  Overall so far rating of 8.9/10. Great game, buy it if you were a fan of the first. If you weren't, go buy/replay the first and get convinced, then buy this!   UPDATE: I have finished the game. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is it fun. The systems have been improved upon greatly and the new race is a blast. Rebalances have made the game a bit more fair, and the new level cap means your old characters are not obsolete. New enemies (and some old ones) reappearing prevent combat from becoming boring or unsettling.  Now for a sad thing. I have encountered a bug (Thats ONE BUG in an entire game). It does not affect gameplay significantly, but occasionally during combat characters will become invisible. The outline below them remains, and the health indicators do not disappear, but the player model is invisible. This applies to both heroes and enemies.  However, since in 29 hours of gameplay I have only encountered a single bug in an otherwise masterful game, I am willing to forgive a small sin.  As others have said, this does lack a bit in story due to it being in the middle of a trilogy. However, this entire game beautifully rises in dramatic action, with perpetually escalating conflict and a permanent sense of impending doom that really ties it all together.  Updating score to 9.4/10.",

The turn-based combat is a drawn-out slog where the best strategy is to delay every fight as long as possible to setup a full team kill, so that weakened enemies waste turns in the meantime. The game also poorly explains many of the new mechanics and skills, and fails to give proper guidance on many missions, forcing you to fail to actually figure out what the win conditions are.  The story or 'Oregon Trail Lite' would be acceptable if you weren't arbitrarily punished by your decisions. There are no difficult decisions to make about what to do, because every choice is either right or wrong. You either pick the right choice and get a bonus, or you pick the wrong choice and a crucial party member is killed or half your caravan is destroyed.",

            "review_text": "Banner Saga is a developing game trilogy inspired by Norse mythology where you lead a caravan of refugees fleeing a world-shattering catastrophe. It consists of story driven strategy gameplay with tactical turn-based battles. Don't expect frantic action requiring lightning reflexes, in Banner Saga you take your time with your decisions, as their consequences may prove heavy. While playing the first game isn't strictly necessary, I strongly recommend it, it will greatly improve your experience.   Second Banner Saga improves on what was already great in the first one. It offers new characters, new classes with new abilities, couple of new enemies, new victory conditions, training missions with objectives for bonus renown, improved caravan management, more animated cutscenes, insanely gorgeous art, great music, apocalyptic story reminiscent of Tolkien's works (complete with the strife and hardship). Plus you can import your save from the first Banner Saga with all consquences of your actions (hero roster, items, clansmen, supplies, renown) which may ultimately affect some of your decisions in BS2. Having the ability to play as either Rook or Alette gives you additional replay value, since dialogue options vary depending on who are you playing as (the main story however remains the same). Easily the best game I've played this year so far.   If I were to point out some negatives, there would be minor issues like the battle screen occasionally being a bit disorienting - they've introduced destructible obstacles with their own strength bars, so if you like to have strength/armor bars visible at all times like I do, the screen is cramped and it's harder to click the correct tile. And perhaps the pacing could have been improved as the final battle feels only as a warm up for the big finale we can expect in the third Saga. Ending with a cliffhanger with final part approx. two years away can be considered criminal :)  Anyway, go buy it, it's great !",

            "review_text": "If you enjoyed Banner Saga 1, like I did, then you'll get great enjoyment out of this.  You'll get roughly around 10 hours (completion time for me) out of the game as a whole, which is quite good, although I felt it could do with an extra 2 hours of content, which I'll come to later.  In terms of improvements; honestly, I've not noticed any. That's not a bad thing, it's just that Banner Saga is rather singular, there's only so much they can do with the game, and it is essentially as the first one was. There have been a few additions to combat (which I don't consider improvements), new abilities and such. I will say however that there is more animations for this one in terms of small cutscenes, which are done very well.  And one of the favourite aspects of Banner Saga - for me anyhow - is the music. The music is still fantastic, and very much immersive. The voice overs are also well done, and suit the characters that they are attributed to very well.  One thing I've been critical of concerning the series is its combat. To be fair, the combat is quite deep. Surprisingly so for a game like this. But I do think the series suffers because of that. Normally I love deep strategic mechanics, but here it feels really tacked on, and not needed. Combat in Banner Saga has always been a convoluted mess I found, and Banner Saga 2 doesn't really improve upon that. I also found myself becoming affected by abilities in combat from the enemy that were not blatantly obvious, although this didn't become apparent until later on when facing Dredge stonesingers and so on. As the game continued on,   I found combat to be more of a chore than a pleasure to play. I enjoyed the story and narrative, and simply felt that the combat just dragged things down. A much more simpler mechanic (but not overly simplified) would certainly benefit this game.  And now comes the bit about the length of the game. 10/11 hours is a fair amount. But considering how the game ended, I'd say it wasn't enough. This has already been brought up in the forums concerning the ending. Banner Saga 1 left on a high note (or a low note depending on your perspective). It finished at just the right time. You felt vindicated and rewarded for your efforts. You felt you played the first game to its conclusion. It really did feel like the end of a tv show, a series. A proper end.  Banner Saga 2... felt like a mid-season finale than anything else. And nobody likes mid-season finales because usually it means ending rather abruptly. That's exactly what happened here. Without going into spoilers, lets just say that certain story threads felt unfinished.  Obviously it's a setup for the next game, but that's not the point. The next game should continue from the previous game's high point. Banner Saga 2 did not reach that high point, and honestly, I was hoping to get more out of it. I was hoping for a better conclusion than the one we got.  Regardless, TBS2 is highly recommended, and I look forward to TBS3!  ",

The story is still good and you're fully immersed in the journey that the characters are on, but you definitely feel that this is the middle of the trilogy. There weren't many answers, yet you have more questions. There were a few choices that I wasn't sure as to what to pick so they might warrant a second playthrough, which is a good thing because TBS2 is definitely a few hours shorter than the first TBS. TBS also had a few choices that warranted another playthrough, but the endboss in TBS was just so tedious and RNGbased that I never got around to another go at it. In TBS2 however I never encountered anything that was particularly unfair, so no problem there.  Looking forward to the final installment!",

            "review_text": "Fresh off finishing the first installment of The Banner Saga, the Steam Sale gave me a perfect segue into the second installment in the franchise. Overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed it, although I do have a few quibbles. There seemed to be some scripting issues where the game talked about a character in the past tense (i.e., as if they were dead) when they were still alive and in my party. And I also found myself annoyed by having a bunch of party members die but not actually knowing when it happened. It seemed like deaths were a bit more obvious and important in the first Banner Saga, so I'm not sure if that was just an oversight or an intentional thing.   Besides that, the story was still pretty engaging, the cast of characters diverse and interesting and the caravan management still tough and satisfying. I have to give Stoic props for crafting a game with some really tough decisions. So many developers go for the whole 'choice' system a la Bioware, where the options are so brazenly good or evil. So often it seems like you're either a Good Samaritan or a jackass who kicks puppies. But The Banner Saga actually seems to deal in shades of grey, and that makes for a much more interesting experience. The choice to go with a dual narrative here was also a pretty bold one, especially given the initial stark difference in terms of a 'likability factor' for the two protagonists. But the secondary storyline quickly grew on me and I became quite engrossed in both. Prior to playing the first Banner Saga, I had read a lot of people complaining that the game ended on a cliffhanger. After playing the game myself, I didn't find that to be the case. The game was a bit short yes, but the story wrapped itself up in a way that was satisfying but clearly left room for another installment. However, with TBS2, I didn't feel that the ending was so clearly satisfying. I'm left hungry for more and quite empty inside. Hopefully Stoic is able to have a quicker turnaround with the third installment!",

The world is breaking (Ragnarok) and this is part of the mystery as the story unfolds. In many aspects this sequel continues the trend of The Banner Saga 1. But on a grander scale. The enemies are more varied, the battles have more diverse environments and other winning objectives than simply 'defeat all enemies'.  The battles feel integral in moving the story along and it is paced very, very well in my view. The game's underlying mechanic is essentially getting from A to B via C via X. Confusing? Not really as the story branches out and introduces new main characters such as the war torn Varl (a race in this universe) Bolverk. A stark contrast (depending how you play and your choices of course) to the other main character.  The story, and choices, are multi-layered as you make decisions as to how (not) to protect your Caravan of people at the base level. The stakes are upped when you parley with more powerful individuals, whether in regards to magic, title or simply supernatural beings, and need to make decisions that can affect whole communities or possibly the world.  If you have played The Banner Saga 1, you will want more answers regarding the game's overarching plot of the world breaking apart. These are somewhat passed along to the player just like treats to a pet. They satisfy you for a bit but you stay to get more as The Banner Saga 2 augments the series' universe. The lines are blurred and your morality, as well as your view of people, will get challenged. Compared to other 'choices matters' games it does matter here. Main characters can die, or be lost, 10 minutes after using all your ressources leveling them up.  Common sense will get you far in this game, but what exactly is common sense when you are presented with possible world altering consequences?",

Pros: * Art, music, atmosphere remain good. * Promotion/ranks are easier in this game * Strategy has improved; the approach to the training tent can net you Renown. Better special attack combos in general. * Your choices matter in this game. Be prepared to risk losing characters you love or for fights you feel conflicted about, especially late in the game. * Ludin seems...nicer. He was a character I didn't like in BS1, and he seems to have grown in BS2. * Reasonably good way of handling/discussing sexism for the setting. * I imported an old save; I could immediately tell my choices in BS1 mattered. I saved Egil in BS1 and Alette lived, and that actually gave me a special scene in BS2 at a certain godstone.  Cons: * Image flickering in Old Wood with Horseborn fight * Occasional lag * Don't expect to be playing from the perspective of a 'hero' all the time. Bolverk is...different. He's probably the furthest thing from heroic, and oftentimes I found all of the options in conversation for him to be negative ones. He can be very rewarding, as his personal story is very rich, but in the beginning, he's incredibly frustrating, at least for me. * Ending feels a bit...abrupt, comparedto BS1. As if one is being stopped mid-tale. BS1 has a sense of closure to me; BS2 feels like I'm left on a cliffhanger. Could be a pro, depending on how you like your plot structured; it was just a bit jarring for me.",

Yes I do believe so, you will seriously miss out on lore and back story for the characters if you don’t! Not to mention your choices from the first game are carried over.   This game has made some great improvements most notably for myself is the foraging system. In the first game you had to buy supplies with renown which was also required to level up, you had to balance on the fine line of ‘keeping your people alive?’ or ‘levelling up to win battles’ Now while you do still need to buy supplies your clansmen now go out and forage while on the path which is a massive help. There are also new a new species, new enemies and hazards in the battlefields now which makes the battles more interesting.   The story continues on from the last game and more is revealed and hinted at as to why the world is breaking. But the game is left on a massive cliff-hanger so gosh darn it I can’t wait for the third game! Please don’t let it be in two years…  The music is again beautiful and atmospheric, I made sure to purchase the special edition so I own the OST. The art is again just magnificent and makes me desperately want an official art book. HINT HINT stoic!  This game is worth the asking price, I have no regrets. Though it did feel a little shorter than the first one, however I’m not entirely sure if it is because this one is shorter or rather the final boss in the previous one took many many many retries….  Once again the developers have released a brilliant game and have made me a devoted fan for life!  Thanks for a great experience, can’t wait for the next one! ",

With survival mode’s high stakes and the campaign’s new monsters, hero abilities and characters every choice felt decisive.   The story mode on the other hand was much easier that in the first. Even on my later runs in BS 1 my caravan came dangerously close to starvation and despair. The new forage and training mechanics gave me more freedom to roleplay without worrying about the impact my decision would have on supplies.  The Banner Saga 2 is a great continuation to the plot of the first game with some answers to the questions of the first teased and many more questions blatantly throwing themselves at the player.",

The Norse lore is quite fascinating and is well integrated to the livelihood/power/pride of the people living in it. Each chapter gives a challenge to the player and helps them explore new ways to enjoy a fight.   Now for the cons I mainly have gripes on a few issues like the training portions in which they have glitches of disregarding objectives or War Horn is not responding, even in normal mode you may gain 7 waves of skulking minions, some choices for outside assistance like side archers are not helpful and some of the conversation choices are just going to ♥♥♥♥ people off(applicable on both genders). The Banner Saga 2 as a whole is a great strategic game, cool Nordic lore and compelling combat with interesting mechanics that aren’t hard to learn or make new strategies of your own.

The combat is decent, but that's not the main reason you'd want to buy the game (though it does have some interesting mechanics). The story is really what drives the game, and in comparison to its predecessor, it easily matches or equals it. My recommendation would be to not skip the 1st game, although you have the option to do so. I quite enjoyed the story that Banner Saga is telling, and I look forward to the conclusion. The universe is a vibrant blend of fanciful Norse Myth, and it is a great setting for this tale.  The Bad:  One of my main issues with this sequel(and I think the developers are aware of some of these), are inconsistancies between choices in the previous game and dialogue in this one. Another shortcoming is the lack of reaction/punishment for letting your caravan starve/die. There are few repurcussions or character reactions, and it kind of wrecks the tone when you've accidentally killed most of your party and yet they still act as if you're a great hero who saved everyone. It feels as if they could have done more with the choice mechanics and the party mechanics, as the storytelling is really this game's strongpoint. The combat is not able to carry the game on it's own, and could have been improved by additional features.  Overall: Wonderful art and story, but could have been improved in some areas. I still like it, and would recommend to those who like plot-driven games.",

            "review_text": "Alright, so I've played quite a few turn based stragey games over my years, and I have to say... This game is amazing! I actually owned the first one for the longest time but I was merely too intimidated by it at first to play it, but finally grabbing the nerve to sit down and play revealed how much of a treat this was.  Now the story is quite a treat for people who enjoy grim tales, as it is the end of the world as a massive force of stone-like soldiers called the Dredge are marching from their homes in the north and underground all the way south. Through the lands of horned Giants called Varl, and into the human lands. If you've played the first game you'd know this, and if you skipped it the game will take some time to catch you up on what happened. This story picks up about a few weeks after the finale of the last game. The boats are finished and it is time to sail down stream and make your way to the human capital and hopefully to safety.  I won't go into too much detail about the story, but it is great, especially playing the games back to back. Without spoiling everything there is only one thing I found dissappointing. It feels like some of the characters doesn't get as much time or lines as they desreve. For some it is perfectly fine because they are unimportant or could have been dead by this point. The only one this really bugs me for though is the Prince. Ludin at the end of the game seems like he'd be a bigger deal than he was. but since he can die I understand why. The gave also recieves more mercy for being an indie game with only so much time and team.  Gameplay wise, nothing has changed all that much. It is the same as the first game, but the Rank Cap has been pushed up higher. If you are a fan of turn based strategy you'll enjoy this! This game made my eyes sparkle and made me raise my voice in outrage as things happened compared to some other games. You can even tune the difficulty up or down to make it easier or harder for you. Just to find the right experience for you! Now for traveling on the road they made it so Clansmen aren't just dead weight, they can now forage and collect extra supplies while you also can train them into soldiers. So you need to decide between how many soldiers you want and how many Clansmen you want to forage for food while you travel. A great improvement from one to two!  Understand though that this is not a happy game per say, if you are expecting everything to go your way, don't. Some choices will screw you over and there will be nothing you can do about it. People will betray you and vice-versa, and despite all your hard work sometimes things will go to ♥♥♥♥ and you will have to deal with it. In battle people will get wounded and die, choices will have consiquences and sometimes there just isn't a good choice, managing your caravan will be hard some of the pain from that part has been lessened though. If you want things to go right for the main character, you'll be dissappointed.  Still, if you are a fan of turnbased strategy give this game a try! If you're hesitant, take a look at some videos to help make up your mind. That is what lead to me getting these games and playing through them. Hopefully this has helped you out with forming an opinion on the game and taking a look.",

Once again the gorgeous art style evokes a feeling of purity and beauty, yet in this second installment there is a clear feeling of loss and danger that comes with it. As you pass through the world, it gives one pangs of sorrow, because it's clear that the darkness is coming to destroy all that is lovely.  To begin, THE SOUNDTRACK ALONE IS WORTH THE MONEY! Austin Wintory (composer of Journey, flOw, Horn, The Banner Saga, and many more) does an exceptional job once again building the perfect rugged and fierce atmosphere for this mystical Nordic landscape. The music fits the brutality of war; blaring horns bombard the listener in fight sequences, and in the time between fights, the soundtrack helps keep tension high. Soulful performances by the vocal soloists tie everything together perfectly.   This product is more of a story than a videogame, and you truly feel like your decisions have weight. The storyline is great-- major props to the writers for creating such a well crafted experience. There is no right decision at any fork in the road, and many times along the journey you will regret your choices. It is virtually impossible to finish this game without questioning some moves you had to make, but that is part of the beauty. The combat system is not too challenging, but at times thinking on your feet and making sacrifices is going to be required. You are challenged to take on the personality of your character and do not only what you want to do, but also what your character is able do while keeping a good reputation. There are consequences for being too ruthless, but also for being overly-soft or lenient. You have to strike a balance.  In my opinion, the most important thing to keep in mind while playing this game is that it is just ONE part of a MULTIPLE part series, and should be treated as such! Do not go in expecting closure at the end, or even a perfect story-arch. What you get is part of an incredible journey, one that isnt too common in games. I STRONGLY recommend this game, the previous game, and any future games in this series.  On their own, each game may not be a feature-length experience and game, but when put together, you get a 30+ hour adventure that is unforgettable. I can't wait for The Banner Saga 3!",
