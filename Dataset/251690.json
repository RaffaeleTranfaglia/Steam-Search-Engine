Ai is okay, there aren't any issues aside from the randomness of the game, one strategy i use consistently fails and then i try something by accident and i score. IMO its a fun game but i feel like theres not a lotta skill in it and it seems to be random. I'll update when i get more hours into it tho",

Just to receive a major whooping for sh**s and giggles? 5-) Ok, this is SERIOUSLY boring... 6-) After so many meaningless seasons, I think that I finally have a chance to turn the tables. 7-) Well, that was close but I can certainly win next time. 8-) GAME OVER?! What the hell is wrong with this game?!  Overall, it's not the worst game ever but it's certainly one of the most tedious and sadistic that were ever created.",

So fun and addicting for me...the second I opened it up I couldn't exit until I beat the first cup or whatever its called...heh. However, I got this through Humble Bundle - don't think I would pay 10 bucks for it, but honestly haven't explored the rest of the game options beyond Career mode so far. If 10 bucks isn't much to you, then I recomend picking it up if you're in to these type of games :D If 10 is pushing it for you, I'd wait for it to go on sale (or grab it from Humble Bundle now!)

The overall feel of the game is the same but a few issues prevent it from truly recreating the feeling of the original.   I guess expecting a simple graphical update to the original is a bit much as this is probably more of a modernised version of the game and newcomers to the series may find that this game is a lot of fun (which it is); The game just seems to be lacking the soul that made the original so great.    The aiming seems to now be somewhat automated whereas before you would have to aim to one of the 8 directions available on the joystick, this does make the game easier for newcomers and I can see why this is the way it is. Player selection seems to be a bit clunky at times, suddenly your control is moved to another player and you'll end up performing actions you didn't intend. The menus are certainly a lot more simplified than the original and it seems as though a lot of the control you have over your squad and their training is lost.   I would say overall this game is definitely easier than the original (Steel Fury used to be a very strong opponent but now you can wipe the floor with them) But it's still got something about it that makes me want to play it, I would still recommend this to people just don't go into it expecting to feel and play just like the original.",

Initial impressions, it's a shame it don't have manager mode or the ability to customize the team as much as you could in the PS2 version Speedball 2100, and the team graphics within the game are a little too retro for my tastes,  but Hell, it's Speedball and I just LOVE IT!!!!!!  There is much scope for further and future development (ie, to be able to design one's own stadium would be a very nice touch) and I hope that this game will go through some further development and expansion in time  But at the very least, it takes me right back and I love it as much now as I did when Speedfball 1st came out all those aeons ago!",
