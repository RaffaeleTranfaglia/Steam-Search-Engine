            "review_text": "'Gothic 3 scored only 8/10 because producer JoWood 'rushed out' production...' that's a funny complaint because an 8/10 from any major critic is a heavenly blessing upon a game like Gothic 3. Nobody who plays any of the Gothic or Risen games is ever on the fence about them; you either love them or wish that you could set the developer on fire.    Allow me to explain:   I love Gothic 3. I come back to it over and over even though by now the graphics are seriously dated (I had originally reviewed the game many years ago and called it beautiful) and I have discovered pretty much everything in the world that there is to discover. There are hours upon hours of quests and content in the game to keep you busy and most of them are pretty easy to figure out. Rarely do you have to trek across an entire continent (like in some other open world RPG's out there) in order to pick up item x and then walk all the way back to drop it off. It happens... but it's rare.   Allow me to first address the number one thing anybody will ever criticize about any Pirhana Bytes game: The combat  SUCKS ! Even after official and community patches it's still one of the worst combat systems I've ever experienced and without a doubt  the  worst in an RPG. Let me save you some frustration though:    If you're fighting near a hill, ALWAYS make sure you're below the enemy; if you're fighting downhill you can't hit them for some reason.    Trying to use any offensive spell other than fireball will most likely get you killed; don't invest any of your learning points into magic. In fact just use archery and you'll be a lot happier with combat once you get the better bows.    If you do have to fight in melee, just mash the attack button. Never block, it's useless. If the enemy backs up out of range and you can't close the distance, stop attacking for a second and right when they're about to strike, spam attack again.    Two handed weapons are super strong but while your character is powering up his swing, you will be murdered. With enough points in strenth a one handed sword can one-hit almost every enemy in the game.  Like I said, combat is extremely unbalanced and poorly executed but once you get used to it, it's actually kind of funny. Near the very beginning of the game there is a literal army of orcs camped outside a castle and with very little training and the starting weapon I was able to single handedly kill every last one of them because for some reason they all wait for you to kill the guy you're attacking before another one attacks you. The only exception to that is with archers; they'll shoot you while you're fighting someone else.  The world is huge and unfortunately either due to how old the game is or simply poor design choices (a common theme with Pirhana Bytes' games) the quick travel system is horrible. You have to first find teleporter stones to a town or (very rarely) another location and then use them like an item. A neat idea but it just doesn't work well. For one thing, the cities are in some cases so far apart that even if you use a teleporter stone you still have to walk for 20 minutes to where you're trying to go. Since enemies and items never respawn this gets pretty boring in the mid-game. But on the plus side there  is  a lot to see and discover in the world; obviously not as much as say, Oblivion, but it gets relatively close (it has absolutely nothing on Skyrim, though).  As with all of the Gothic and Risen titles, the voice acting is a joke. In Gothic 3 this is compounded by the script also being a joke. I don't think it was given to a native English speaker for proofreading; if it was he just phoned it in that day. I would love to see a Gothic 3 movie that uses the actual game script. That would be comedy gold.  There isn't a WIDE variety of weapons but there are plenty to keep you progressing. Unfortunately theyre's always one obvious choice that's better than what you have, no real reason to experiment with other weapons. For example: I have never used an axe or a quarterstaff. There's no point. That would be really annoying in any other RPG but since, as I mentioned above, combat was little more than an afterthought by the developers of this game... you don't really notice. You just buy the next better weapon so that you can kill faster.  Magic system is broken and they never bothered to fix it, don't even waste your time. Some of the spells have such a long 'power-up' (super saiyan) time that you'll be dead before you ever get to see what they do. Having fireball scrolls can be useful in a pinch but they do about the same damage as a strong bow unless you waste a bunch of learning points strengthening your magic (and ultimately losing the game unless you're fairly experienced).  Speaking of learning points, in the Gothic games (and the first Risen) you level up differently than in other RPGs. You gain experience and gain a level like in other games but you don't get anything but learning points when this happens. You then have to find trainers to either increase attributes or teach you new skills. In the beginning of the game you level up super-fast but levelling eventually slows down and then stops so make sure you have a plan on where you want your character to go before you start spending learning points willy-nilly. I like this system, I just wish there were more levels in the game so that you could customize your character a bit more. You can really only MASTER one combat art which is why I say magic is useless... if there were more learning points available it'd be fun to play around with but it stunts your strength in melee or ranged combat.  Reagents for potions never grow back like they do in, say, The Elder Scrolls. On the surface this seems wrong but the fact that there are potions you can make that permanently increase one of your attributes or skills shows you why they did this. If you could just keep making those over and over again there would be no need to ever spend learning points. There are plenty of reagents in the world to make more healing potions than you will ever need, anyway. Honestly come to think of it I don't think I've ever made a healing potion. You find a ton just by fighting and opening chests.  I could go on forever. It's difficult to explain what makes Gothic 3 a good time because, especially as a new player, you will rage quit a few times. You will hear some dialogue exchanges that make you think 'why the hell am I playing this?'. You will notice some of the skills or crafting recipes never got finished (only 2 or 3) and if you spend money to learn them you basically just wasted your money. Quests will break and you'll have to load a save (and in a couple rare cases I've found, completely start the game over).  But I love it.  Maybe I'm a masochist.",

            "review_text": "First off I would like to say, even though my time says I have only played 30 hours. That is when I got it on steam. I actually got the game on a CD first(saddly the CD broke and lost all my saves &gt;.&lt;), and I've clocked well over 60 hours on that. I don't know my exact time but i've seen and played a lot of this game.   Much like the Gothic series, this games boasts a HUGE landscape to explore. Even if you look on the top world view(main map) That is about half the map as their is a whole other level to the game, the amount of caves and tunnel you have to explore is huge as well. The areas you have to explore are beautiful and some scenes you can just stand there watching it for awhile. The map is huge for a game that doesn't give your a great fast-travel system, but that is the fun of an open world game, them forcing you to explore.  This game, is unfinished though, even the developers came out saying that the people who put them up to it, rushed the game to be released long before it was ready. So you will find caves that are completely empty, pockets of pitch blackness even with a torch. Grass and trees that don't match the landscape. Even some areas that are just empty of anything. Anyone who has played through and explored the map has seen this, it does mark the game as not completed. Now, if they had completed the game, it might have been THE best game of that time, but, who knows, they never did.  Comabt wise, the game is very simplistic, it goes on a 'duel' system, so you'll rarely have 2 or more people gang up on you, so it is mostly 1v1, even if you are surrounded by an army. Your moves consist of the same thing and it's very easy to kill the enemies. Saying that though, any archers or magic users are not afraid to cast their spells at you, even when your already fighting someone, and spells in this game are VERY unforgiving, some even doing a 1 or 2 hit on you. What makes this game all the harder, is that there is no auto-save feature. So you will have to manually save. It's smart to save every time you enter and leave a town, this game will make you a spastic saver. Getting killed with a sword or axe though, is just as easy, as the computer gets the exact same attack patterns you do, and if your not careful, you can be quickly killed off. (Basicly, once they start a combo and you can't break it, your dead.). Archery works fantasic and forces you to aim and be accurate, shields actually do their job, I.E. stopping arrows from hurting you and magic... magic is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sometimes. Overall, the combat is wonky and unforgiving sometimes, but workable.  The quests, although quite simple at times, range wide, towns usually consist in the same but you'll find that the game does follow the progress so, killing off an orc town, well, that means going into any other orc towns wont be easy. This game also has quest that spans the continants. For instance, one quest, for you to get a boat skimatic, which is roughly the middle of hte map, well, to get said skimatic you have to go to the south, into the varrent, a desert, well, sorry, the guy wants ice wolf pelts, and those, can only be found in the north in nordmar. The game makes you travel to this fantastic areas to grab something, it is truely amazing the amount of work was put into this game that wasn't even finish.  This game lacks polish, that is evident in the fact they got rushed to release it, I don't blame the dev's for that, you can only do so much in a certain amount of time and your not allowed to push over. If you can look past it's flaws the game is great, the story is lacking somewhat and isn't that straight forward, but, it makes you take your time and explore. Overall, it is a good game for those who don't mind the lack of polish and the sometimes wonky gameplay. I've loved playing it and I think many others will too.  Quick tip to anyone wanting to get this. Focus on leveling up and getting lots of quests done before truely picking a side. You'll get twice the amount of quests.",

Lots of swearing, nice dialogues, diversified quests, character building. Still got its old Gothic spirit.  The only thing I hated (and I REALLY hated it) was the combat system. Either become a mage or some ranger, donÂ´t focus too much on melee, because fighting is really clunky and even in endgame, when you got used to it all, not really that great. I spent 80% of my fights either running away and shooting the enemy with my bow or standing on some plateau/wall/stone where they couldnÂ´t get me and shoot em down from there. Heck, even the enemies often have massive problems attacking you: a lot of enemies can be beaten by simply walking backwards and shooting them. TheyÂ´ll catch up to you, swing their weapon, walk up to you again, swing their weapon...without hitting you. Not to mention that sometimes the arrows just fly through the enemies (especially snappers, damn beasts...). IN A NUTSHELL: Focus on ranged attacks and youÂ´ll be fine.  Nice, enjoyable, LONG(!) game, good soundtrack, makes a (imo) good end to the story. (since nobody ever wanted Gothic4 ;) )",

I know this game very well and my problem can be I remember all this adventures I have in it. And all of them are very important for me. Those was awesome times when I was traveling across Myrtana and other two countries we have available in this world. And still one more thing, You can't just gave it couple minutes of your time, this game need hours to understand her fully. That's can be reason for me why I can't for now at least, return to it.

It's just, the NPCs and the story felt forced. I just didn't care about any of them or any of it. The best way to complete the story and quests was to systematically collect everything and kill all the monsters in basically a grid-like formation. There was no thought, love, or nuance to it. Here's another big â¥â¥â¥ field or large hill with tons of monsters. Just run up and down the hill to make sure you've scoured everything and killed all the filthy 'beasts.' Get used to hearing 'the beasts'. 'Beasts' was the translators favorite word.  Everyone had a quest for you and they were all basically the same thing. Talk to person, get something from person, kill enemies, collect items, go back and talk to person, the end. I stopped actually listening to the NPCs dialogue because it was boring, pointless, and lifeless.  Edit: Grammar, I wrote this late at night, give me a break.",

Drink a potion ... sheath your weapon and drink ...your still getting mauled then draw your weapon. While I understand the dev figured you cant drink a potion while in combat or if you have a sword and board. What if you only had 1 sword. I shouldnt have to stop put my weapon away drink then draw my weapon again. Summon Spells break the game. Summoned Skelly army only to be attacked by everyone. Cant despawn them either. So they run rampant killing everyone who attackes them then I get accused of murder.

Having disarmed me the creature moved in and knocked me to the ground. I attempted to get back on my feet and......nothing. I tried again but apparently my character decided it was a good time take a nap.   Eventually I was able through some inscrutable arcane means able to get back up. Noticing I had a ranged weapon option I drew that. Success! And we're back to drooling so I ran around pretending to shoot things while going pewpewpew. This was not very satisfying. I think my character might have died of boredom if I had continued to play much longer.   Then it dawned on me. It's a cleverly designed punching bag simulator! Starring your character as the punching bag.   I noticed from the screenshots the game has dinosaurs in it. Alas, I will not be able to recreate that scene from Jurassic Park where everyone is being chased by the T-Rex.   The camera controls worked but they were as clunky as the rest of the game.

People say it's the best RPG in the world, even better than Skyrim because it has such an amazing, large and deep world to play with. That may be! Except the combat mechanics are literally the worst I've ever had to endure in a video game. Melee combat is horrific. When you try to block an attack it's 50/50 whether it'll actually block it or not. It's not supposed to be 50/50 - if you block it's supposed to block - but the game is so buggy it doesn't always register. You can't tell when an enemy is going to attack because animations are so stiff and poorly done, so it's almost impossible to know when to block. The enemy, on the other hand, will block all your attacks with total efficiency. If you want to play as a melee character, this leaves you with no choice but to approach an enemy and furiously mash the left mouse button to attack over and over and hope you win, which is 50/50. Quite often the enemy will hit you and make you stumble, putting you in what I call a 'death spin' which you can't get out of. This is where the enemy keeps stunning you with each hit, meaning you can't retaliate and eventually die.  Furthermore, the game is buggy as hell. Even with the community patch this game is horrendously buggy. I had to restart 3 or 4 times to get past the first part because after I had killed all the enemies in the little village (by furiously mashing the left mouse button because there's nothing else you can do) because you have to talk to this guy to advance the story afterwards, except when I tried to talk him he just said 'talk later'. After 3 or 4 restarts he finally talked to me.  Archery is even worse. All you have to do is stand on a spot that breaks the enemy AI (which is basically on any kind of rock or tree stump because the AI is awful) and the enemies will begin slowly walking away from you because they have no way of getting to you. So you can wipe out nests of 100 goblins by standing on a rock, even though under normal circumstances 2 or 3 at once would be a challenge.  I can't recommend this game. It's absolutely awful.",

I have to say if you install the 1.75 'beta' test patch its moreorless bug free to a point that it feels like the game it should have been when it was released.  The game has a lot of merits which are sadly lost mostly in time due to its terrible launch, the story is interesting and the content is massive. I was impressed with just how many quests and towns there was.   However like every game there was a couple of things that still annoyed me, the usual voice changes (Not as drastic as Forsaken Gods thankfully). Also the rebranding of your friends Gorn is now White so is Vatras, also it felt like Vatras was talking to you like he had only just met you when in reality he sailed in on your ship lol.   But if we put them minor points aside I think this game is a lot of fun and very much worth buying (If you install the 1.75 patch).

It still looks good today.  The best feature of the game is the fact that you can do everything pretty much as you want, there is no real guidance through the quests and the main story line. Some people find this daunting, but when you get into it you realise it gives you a real opportunity to experience the game world.  If you want to get to a specific area, the only thing that stops you is either the enemies are too dangerous or it's a stronghold and the faction that owns it doesn't know or trust you. To get through these blockades you have to either train, sneak, do favours, or find a loophole (i.e. getting into an area by doing a job for a farmer).  Because of this, the game has an authentic feel to it. There isn't some unseen force of progression that is compelling things to be driven and world events to happen, it all unfolds in an organic and viewable way.
