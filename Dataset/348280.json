So i wasnt able to play at all. I looked for some help on this but i have seen nothing online about it. there is very little info about this game. normally ill spend a hell of a lot of time getting a game to work but here... i just want to play something fun to play with my kids on local. this isnt it for me.  So with the above in mind i rate this not recommened.",
