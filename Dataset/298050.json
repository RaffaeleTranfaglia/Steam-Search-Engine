            "review_text": "So I am re-writing my review after the latest patch and spending more time playing.  The game is a lot better after this latest patch, a lot more fleshed out. There are still issues that need addressed though.  Pros:  Voice work is amazing Graphics are incredible The technology tree is quite good.  Here are the remaining issues and some are quite significant.  1. Limited tactical combat. You cannot disable engines and shields, board vessels and steal tech. This creates a huge disadvantage for races that have marine improvement perks over other things - it essentially removes a significant source of tech aquisition. Races like the Myrshan and the Bulrathi in particular. It also really removes an important dimension of the original game.  2. The antarans are game breaking - the way they attack is insane. They simply create a massive fleet of small ships that essentially crashes the computer eventually. Small ships are more efficient than larger capitol ships so mostly you die unless you do the same. But you can control where they go because they will attack the planet that has most of your fleet. Honestly it's nonsense. if you get to the Antaran homeworld there are 61 ships - yet they can field a fleet of hundreds just to match a stodgy game mechanic. Utter non-sense. I guess random attacks of reasonable size was too difficult. 3. There doesn't seem to be a way to look at the specs of a ship after it is built. Or to manually retrofit a ship once it is created. You just apply a new build and that is it - cookie cutter style. 4. There is no way to set a rally point - this is just silly.  5. There seem to be nebulas and astroids everywhere - regardless of where combat takes place. I attack a planet and there are nebulas and astroids in front of it. Thats isn't a thing - stop that! 6. The victory conditions win screen is a huge letdown most of the time. I was thinking of modding in the one from MOO2 because it was great.  7. The races are terribly unbalanced. Thankfully you can do custom but still.. 8. Finally anythign that makes marines stronger is essentially a pointless tech or perk. The solution to your fancy marines is to just 'use more bombs' - and since marines only get play in ground invasions this makes it a lot of investment for very little advantage. Maybe you get a few extra turns while your litle marines get thier faces bombed in...  Anyway - less of a crap sandwich but still very frustrating. It just feels like the devs take too much for granted- and this more than anything bothers me - because the original makers were some detail oriented uber-nerds and these guys just isn't.   do better.",

            "review_text": "After 74.5 hours of playing (also hours more during the early access stage) I can say that MoO is a mediocre 4x game. It mimics most of the features of its legendary ancestor (MoO 2)  I am sad to give a negative review for this game. It is certainly playable and you'll have fun with it. But for a 2016 game, I honestly expected much more... Here is a list of pros/cons.  Pros:  1. Excellent cinematics and voice acting.  2. Good language support. 3. Graphically well designed races, race animations, in game research assistants. 4. Fluent game play.  Cons:  1. Repetitive technology tree. Too few creative weapons or technologies. Most of higher tech nodes in the tech tree just replicate the early nodes by just improving parameters. +1 production buildings become +2, x damage weapons become 2x damage weapons and so so. In some tech tree nodes you can decide from 2-3 different technologies but the better tech is in most cases obvious.  2. Although the races are parametrically different (some get bonus to diplomacy, some have better spy mission success chances, some have better ground troops etc.). They all share the same technology tree without a single variation. This makes the game very dull and uninteresting.  3. The game is very uneventful. Unless you provoke the AI (by colonizing near their systems) you can be in good terms with all AI races for the entire game. The AI does not challenge you. No random events that may cause a political crisis between your race and some other AI race occur.  4. The AI is not smart. They do not colonize the choke points systems to protect their borders. They do not make clever attacks or defense. They just throw whatever they have towards you (2-3 fleets at most) and once you deal with em they are left completely defenseless and broken.   5. As with almost all 4x games, harder AI does not mean smarter AI but rather cheating AI.  6. There are no strategically important bread and butter resources in the game. The game needs resources that would end alliances. Resources that will cause every race in the galaxy hunger for them and eventually cause galaxy wide wars. Resources which will enable you to unlock technologies, build buildings and new ship hulls etc.   7. Governing complexity is not scalable. After you acquire 10 or more planets you'll quickly realize this. There is no abstraction method in MoO (such as Stellarsis' sector governing) which will enable you to govern huge empires.  8. I do not understand why the number of different ship classes you can design is limitted. I might be ok with a limit (like 20-30) but 5-6 designs? Seriously? Why?  9. Some annoying bugs which should have been solved in early access at least a year ago. For instance you cannot save your keyboard mapping if you change it. Everytime you enter the game you have to change key mappings again and again. Also the game may lock up or crash after long lasting space battles.",

Something that you'll fire up for a few hours, get some joy out of listening to Mark Hamill voice a bird man, mindlessly watch two gigantic fleets blow each other up, or maybe even have a furry identity crisis staring at cat cleavage. All-in-all a good and campy time, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a game of this price and size.  Now, MoO 'fans,' most of whom are fairweather or never even played MoO 1 and 2, are coming out in droves to trash this game for being a 'shallow' experience. Yet half of them raved about Stellaris at launch, which was and continues to be an unpolished, unbalanced turd that slows to a crawl at midgame, has less than minimal polish, and goes for months without a major update.  So, do I think this is a better game than Stellaris? Hell yeah. If you want to capture some of the magic of MoO2 and play a 4x game with some actual production value, give Master of Orion a shot.",

If you played the first two in the series you will likely find this remake execptionally boring after a short period of time. I wouldn't recommend spending more than $10 on it. Perhaps it can be redeemed through DLC, but right now it's just not worth it. It is really disappoing that both attempts to revive the series (MOO3 and this title) have really fallen short of even basic expectations.",

Edited 12/4/16: Making me pay for fixes to correct problems from their last patch as part of a DLC is unacceptable. Adding AI improvements that the community asked for and then telling us we listened to what the community wanted and charging me for it is also ridiculous. Charge people for the 3 new races if they want it. Do not charge me money for something the community asked for as part of AI improvements or reversing a previous patch that was bad.

            "review_text": "I was going to make a full review of this game. Recommending it. Till I found out that there is no tactical combat, and only auto-resolve for battles in multiplayer. Until that changes I can't possibly recommend this game. If you want to play a MOO with autoresolve, just play FreeOrion, which is, yes, a free game. You'll be better off than playing this game in the current state. Or simply play one of the classics.  Again, there is plenty of good things in this MOO, and it's ok to play a few times in single. But with a multi without tactical combat, or at least the ability to watch the battles in spectator way. The game just isn't worth the price tag. It's a good start. A base of a game to start from and add to it, perhaps in an expansion. BUT, the fact that there is autoresolve only in multiplayer makes it targeting a much narrower group of players who have many other titles to choose from if they wanted an autoresolve driven experience.  So I have to sadly add MOO to the list of failed space 4X games that didn't live up to their full potential. If you want an actual 4X in space done right. Check out: Sword of the Stars Endless Space MOO 3 (Strawberry/Vanilla/Tropical modded), MOO 2  (Galciv 3 could be a great choice too, but since I haven’t played it yet I can’t really recommend it)  Otherwise today's 4X games, keep being released either with no multiplayer at all, or with this kind of crippling decisions to make it autoresolve only. This niche of players, who want to enjoy what was a standard 20 years ago - space 4X games with multiplayer and tactical combat. Before this “less is more” ideology came about and ruined franchises like Command and Conquer. Must just bite the bullet, and realize that today making games like Sims is more profitable than actually making good space 4X games. Or so it seems. This is not just the problem of this MOO. It's the problem of whole industry as you can list all good space 4X games on the fingers of both hands if not just one hand on Steam. Sadly.  EDIT: In addition to the above. This MOO's community is very toxic. Filled with 12yos and trolls. People on the LoL and CS level. Yes, it's that bad. You post a review, or you write a suggestion on forums and get trolls attacking you ad hominem, insulting you, saying f you. Maybe it's because it's done by Wargaming, and people from World of Tanks are here? Or is it because all the adults and actual MOO franchise fans left this failure long time ago after the end of EA? I don't know. But this new Orion's community is nothing I'd recommend anyone getting into. Best avoid it and go to places where you can actually spend quality time with adults instead.  EDIT2: Some UI related things also make you cringe. There is no sitrep. Instead we get icons above end turn button. That you can't filter with the priority of important and less important stuff, they are all displayed in line. And you then 'dismiss' each one of these. And since there's no sitrep list, you can't bring them up again, unless you reload the game. GNN news can't be paused and when skipped they don't give any summary of what they were about. You can turn them off completely. But that's all you can do about it. So if you happen to be busy or get a phone calll at the time the GNN news plays... well, there's no DVR option to repeat it and no summary, no sitrep. Which again is an example of lazy design of the UI that might be ok for a mobile game but not really for a PC game.  EDIT3: Might be because I'm playing not on the highest difficulty setting at this point. But so far the AI is very dumb (so some people keep saying this is a single player oriented game... well, then it sux even more because AI is very dumb). Example that you can always replicate. Fly with your fleet to the enemy system. What will the AI do? Instead of putting their fleet in a stronger position, say, to defend the homeworld. The AI will move ALL the forces from the homeworld, to meet you at the warp point. Where you can first take out the fleet, then move on to the homeworld and take out the space station and other defenses without their fleet around. Yes, it's that bad. I also remember in previous MOOs, especially MOO3 AI was pretty aggressive from the get go. While here AI is camping, sitting idly and attacking you only if they randomly get a cue for it. So the game feels way too easy and with no pressure put on you.  EDIT4: Found more balance issues today. So turns out that when you get a truce with an AI faction, you guys can't have any battles for the duration, right? So how about all the fleets and outposts blocking the warp points during the truce? Simple it's very one sided favoring the dumb AI. During the truce: AI can pass your blockades (outposts, fleets stationed and guarding the warp point). BUT you can NOT pass the said AI's blockades yourself. Making a 'truce' with AI simply 'Give AI some space' deal. Ridiculous.",

            "review_text": "After receiving a 22% helpful rating based on my original review I've decided to attempt a proper review;  As you're probably well aware the latest incarnation of Masters of Orion is what is commonly called a 4X game. eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.  When you start a new game there are a myriad of options when 'creating' a new galaxy within which to play. Be it a large galaxy, small, how many empires inhabitat said galaxy, which species they are, game speed and other options besides. Meaning you can setup an epoch spanning game that could easily lasts days or weeks (it seems) to games that perhaps take a mere afternoon. I'd have to spend some more time with the varying settings to give you more details on this.  As your sweaty little fingers eagerly click your abused mouse button, with it's cursor hovering over the start game tab you'll find yourself transported to your galaxy and a single planet. From here you will manage your population putting them to work in the food industry, manufacturing plants and labs. Managing your output of food, construction of buildings and space ships and research into new technologies.  You'll eventually send scoutships out to discover new systems full of juicy (or not so juicy) planets to explore and perhaps even colonize. When you colonize your new planets you'll have to carefully manage their early years, it helps to buy (automatically receive) automated construction factories, biomes and indoor farming to help your colonists thrive and build newer structures quicker, increasing your population size and therefore food construction and research speed, eventual increase in taxes with government buildings and tradeports and increasing your fleet size with starbases.  Some planets have negative effects, such as high or low gravity, toxicity, barren, gas giant or asteroid. Eventually you will unlock techs to change all of the above into habital planets or at least more appealing to your average space colonist.  Diplomacy seems to work well, in as far as I've experienced it on my singular game I'm still going through. I don't attack the marlocks, (or whatever the hell they are) and we trade technologies and set up trade between us increasing our monies.  What does annoy me though is that when it comes to espionage in order to put an agent on an enemy planet you need to have visited it first whereas my friendly foe has no problems with this, having made sure their ships never entered my space in a couple of rather more violent forms of diplomacy. Yet they still have agents on all of my planets. Perhaps this is a racial perk as their faction is the espionage specialists. But still, it annoys me.  The space battles themselves are a bit... Meh. Still, better than most space battles I've witnessed in other 4X games.  Despite my lack of conversing with all of the races within the game, I rather like the characters I've seen so far and the 'Global News Network' droids that tell you everything you need to know about the galaxy in a fairly amusing manner and occasionally some helpful news too. Such as detailing the top three races in colonization, population, military etc. The most recents news story was several cips about a star about to go supernova. You'll be pleased to know that on the brink of disaster the weird turtle people managed to save themselves and stop the star going supernova.  Overall, probably my favourite 4X game. It's relatively complex and yet VERY streamlined. Fans of the genre should enjoy this.  If you don't find this review helpful go play with a chickens ♥♥♥♥.  -  My original review;  I like it.",

They fixed the racial traits, random race picker, tech tree issues and many other things. This game is now far closer to the MOO formula we all know and love. And while I'm still not a huge fan of the RTS ship combat I understand that this is a new entry in the game and they have to mix things up somewhere. If they just carbon copy moo2 with updated graphics then its not a new entry its an update. I do really like what they have done with the pollution system on this version though. In other MOOs a portion of your production was lost to pollution clean up. In this version you have to burn turns of production to clean up your pollution. You have to ballance between production and clean up. The one major thing that I think is still missing is the ship refit feature, in previous moos you could take an outdated ship park it at one of your planets and spend production to refit it with more modern tech. The only way to do that in this version is to spend mass amounts of BC which makes it almost not worth it. I'd rather sacrifice my old ship to the guardian and build a new one in 20 turns then spend 2800bc on an upgrade. Would be nice if i could spend production on that instead of money.

            "review_text": "*WARNING* Possible spoilers ahead'  I have only played this reboot of the 'Master of Orion' series for about 4 hours, but already I see the immense detail, time and care put into the game. Firstly, they hired top notch voice actors *cough cough* Mark Hamil *cough cough* . They paid these actors probably hundreds if even thousands of $$$ in order to have this game in top quality standard before release.   Secondly, the actual structure of the game and lack of glitches and bugs are absolutely fantastic. The way that they designed the ship paths around stars and the way that everything was animated really made me feel like I was commanding a galactic empire. Good ol' M.O.O.1, the legendary M.O.O.2 and ESPECIALLY the godawful M.O.O.3 do not live up to this new competitor. And dont get me started on the AAA graphics.  Lastly, the way that they structured the gameplay is fan-f***ing-tastic. The A.I is so well developed that top players from Stellaris, M.O.O.2 and other strategy games lose so often to the A.I. The A.I will do the most seemingly random things sometimes, such as blowing up your space-factory when they are on the verge of defeat in order to distract/annoy you, they might give you technology and befriend you even though they are more advanced and they may even destroy you before you have researched Xeno Relations. They are just that good!   In Conclusion, we can see based on my experience that this new iteration of the 'Master of Orion' franchise lives up to the legends of old and then some. I Highly recommend this game to all those that are looking for a fantastic, humorous 4X strategy game.",

            "review_text": "1 November 2016. 1443 MST.  I purchased this game roughly two weeks ago, and loved it. There were some frustrating moments, like AI opponents all being warlike and wanting to invade my territory within ten turns of first contact unless my military capability was larger than theirs. But today's update has changed this dramatically. The update removed the ability to actively remove pollution from a world. It also increased the amount of pollution that buildings and people produce, while the buildings that are supposed to passively remove pollution haven't changed. The net effect is that developed/developing colonies WILL destroy their ecosystems with pollution and there is now nothing you can do to change that. You will be stuck periodically re-terraforming every world you inhabit.  To make matters worse, today's 'update' has changed the gravity tolerances of all races that have a gravity tolerance that isn't total. It used to be that all races in the game could handle normal gravity. One race could handle low, one could handle high, and one could handle all gravity conditions. Now, if your race has a gravity tolerance other than normal that's the ONLY gravity level your race can handle. To make matters worse, normal gravity worlds seem to be roughly half the worlds in any map seed. Low gravity SEEM to be 25%, and high gravity SEEMS to be the other 25%. The nail in the coffin is that the one and only building in the whole game that can change a world's gravity level will ONLY change the gravity level to normal. Net effect here? Two races in this game have been rendered essentially unplayable. There is no possible that you can ever be competitive playing either.  It grieves me to say that I can no longer recommend this game. I find myself in the position where I have to apologize to two people that I bought the game for as a gift, as well as the others I've recommended it to. DO NOT buy this game. Run. Run and hide.",

I suggest the producers to start playing the first two games to understand what is all about and change it radicaly. It think all how are playing this game will be happy. At some point in time during the game I was not even bother to control the fleet battles. How can it be in the MoO to control the fleet in real time mode, I think this is one of biggest disapointments. All you are doing during the game it's to select the next thing to be built on different colonies and to do some research. I end up playng the Master of Orion 2, far more interesting than this one.",

It satisfied my need of nostalgia, and made me want to play a galactic dictator (or monetary star baron) all the time. The initial rush was great, and I enjoyed playing this title.  Until the release of the Antarans.  Sure, give us races that we played with in Master of Orion 2, that was great. Sure, give us the Antarans, they could be annoying but controllable. But with this? I have one planet, with a star base and a missile battery. And what happens?  Defeated. Repeatedly. Doesn't matter if I try to rush with colony ships, they get blasted to bits by this overpowered race of roaches. And they always pick on me, even with three other races out there to butt heads with. And it doesn't help that I only have one colony while everyone else cranks out colonies like there's no tomorrow. Even on Very Easy, I get stomped with no relief. Best case scenario is that I ally with a race like the Humans; instead, I end up with races like the Silicoid or Bulrathi, both expansionist and warlike, and not keen on sharing space.  Oh, and let's not forget random events that seem to severely hamper me when least expected. Even though the previous Master of Orion titles had those annoying mishaps occur, I could reload a save game before all that happened, and I'd manage to breeze through that turn with no harm done. Here, it seems like the events are already fixed, and WILL happen to you no matter what you do. Even choosing the Lucky trait didn't give me breathing room from, you guessed it, the ANTARANS!  Frankly, I'm disappointed with how this game has turned out in the long run. Sure, I can turn off the random events and Antarans, but what fun is that if I did? I enjoy the game, but these new updates are killing off my joy for it.  So until then, I'm just going to let it gather dust until they either reduce how OP'd the Antarans are, or at least beef up my defense.",

Once again i find myself immersed in the world of MOO with its haunting lonely vast expanses of space where home is onboard a huge colony ship or other space faring vessel. Exploration and discovery abound in joyful moments of finding a planet that can be colonised in all its mysterious beauty waiting to reveal its naked reality to you. Then there are asteroid fields which can be mined as well as strange signals in distant places where advanced technology or some anamoly which may or may not be a threat could be waiting to be discovered.  You will encounter other races alien and inhuman looking who may or may not become your ally depending on ones skill at universal politics. Of course there could be some who because of their tempermental and competitive nature will turn on an ally just for the fun of battle such as the flirtatious and easily offended Mrrshan ruled by the feline Empress Marupa.  Then there are the space pirates who are a constant threat but with a bit of exploration and bomb capable space ships you can discover their bases of operation and blast them to stinking fragmented bits of charred flesh.  Taxing your empire for much needed coin to run it is a necessity to be able to afford the research and development to create the habitats, weapons, ships, electronics, population motivating items etc etc needed to grow and florish across the universe as well as be more attractive to other races as an ally when making many types of agreements, trading tech, paying tribute, giving gifts etc. Just make sure not to tax your people too much at the wrong time or you may find them rebelling as they unleash their displeasure until you act one way or the other.  Graphics bring the infinity of space along with the bliss and horror of new worlds. Alien races are a sight to behold capturing a 1990s science fiction quality as if from an episode of BABYLON 5 and STAR TREK. Battles are violent and catastrophic as scenes of ships charging full speed ahead with ballistic and energy weapons blazing across monitor screens create exciting encounters which are played depending on whether you auto resolve, give partial control to the ai or take complete command of the battle controlling your ships in battle which is wonderfully executed.  Music captures a mix of classical and 1990s science fiction ambience relaxing yet full of suspense and the wonder of discovering a universe. Hearing the insane amounts of voice acting by an all star cast who create characters who are very diverse, full of depth and unique is an incredible experience to go through which motivates me to keep diplomatic contact with them.  MASTER OF ORION a true successor and success of a time past which has risen to claim its place once more in the annals of gaming history.  MASTER OF ORION, BUY IT!

MoO remake is faithful to its roots in almost every sense of the word.   The races involved &amp; tech tree feel familliar, the playing is smoothed out &amp; has a new if a bit simplified feel to it. The simplification is superficial though, as your colonies number in the 6-10ish the simplification feels welcome and maybe even lacluster (MoO veterans know what im talking about, The horror of managing 20+ colonies).  There is a colony manager that you can set in general terms, manufacture, research etc (helps a little).  Ships can be upgraded, so thats a relief, no more Mk I s*itboats running around getting blown up. Upgrading is easy (just park your ship to a planet you controll &amp; refit the bugger to the latest blueprint)  Diplomacy is there, more choices than most 4x games.. Pretty straightforward..   Spying, now this is where they made a lot of changes, you can now select what your spy does. Disrupt trade, steal tech, etc etc.. There is a whole tree for that now..   Combat: Realtime, felt odd at first, but after a few bouts it works.. Weapons are arced so you can manouver your little buggers to 'bite the bears ♥♥♥'.. Wont work so well in big fights (naturally) turning speed seems to be linked to the size of the ship..   Overall.. I would recommend it to every MoO veteran out there.. Give it a go and dont be too critical in the first hour or so.. You might just have found a jewel in the rough..

For example, I've played a game where the ai Sakkra was colonising as much planets as he could with his huge army of frigates and destroyers while the ai Silicoid was using a smaller number of bigger ships using biological bombs (or whatever they are called) as he was trying to genocide everyone.  In my opinion, pretty much everything is balanced and there isn't any overpowered technology, ship design or race bonus. These are all good at what they do.  The game has improved massively since its apparition. The development team is clearly working hard to make this game awesome. Good job and keep it up!  P.S. : Most of the negative reviews are people complaining about the lack of content that was in the previous games of the series. What if it was the first 'Master of Orion'?",

It is wonderful to build your own race, build ships, populate worlds, and blow the daylights out of alien scum. The AI is superior with some minor issues. Diplomacy could be more robust with more ability to haggle, but on the whole this is one of the most fun games in a long time.  Even BETTER than the gameplay is that I get the feeling that the developers LIKE gaming. They want feedback. There is an in-game bug reporting function. The trouble ticketing is easy and simple. I contrast this with Sega's Warhammer Total War. Sega appears to be much more about the money and is willing to put out substandard games. NGD Studios appears to want to play GREAT games and share them with us. Thanks for being gamers first NGD!",

POSITIVES Nice graphics and cut scenes Modern UI Smooth transitions and scrolling Tech tree display is very nice/well done Pleasant music Good sound effects Excellent path to victory timeline graph  NEGATIVES Few planets in each system Multi-ship fleets appear as one vessel despite zoom level No multi-player manual combat Only one tech research at a time, few paths  Overall nothing really bad but not exactly innovative either.  I would have liked to see a few things different. First, because of its relationship to the Wargaming company, I had hoped to have battle occur in the manner of World of Warships or World of Tanks. Likewise I had hoped for the ship customization that is used in those titles to find its way into this game. Upgraded modules, signal flags, pennants, ammo options, etc.  The espionage system has tons of potential but is handled very simply. It would be amazing to have a few espionage cut scenes and some more detailed choice trees. Perhaps specialization of operatives? Maybe some tactical missions that allow players to control the spy?  This game is competent and has a modern look, but there are more interesting options to consider. 7/10",

It is just an improved MOO with better graphics and i am happy with that. Two things I want  1) Leaders ( would make the game so much more interesting)  2) the Antarans.  I would give the game an 8 or 9 out of 10.  EDIT- After playing some additional MP games I am going to have to reevaluate my score.. Change it to a 6.5 out of 10 for now. No tactical combat in MP is a really really bad move for many reasons.. There is just too many unknown variables, for example is it still better to load your ships with nukes in MP? or should you do mix? does the AI know in the simulation that your nuclear fleets should stay as far from the enemy as possible? Devs please give us some information on this. thanks",

The early game is exploration and discovery, with several turns going by between actions other than ship movements (playing on Prewarp, which I always do). The GNN events bring me back to that as well, although I was surprised the first time I saw a whole other race (Mrrshan) wiped out by a supernova!   Later in the game you become more cautious, consolidating your gains or taking advantage of your opponents' weaknesses to attack them. It's fun and exciting and I enjoy it thoroughly.  I don't prefer the combat system, as many have stated, so I just put it on cinematic unless it's a close battle that I think my human brain needs to participate in. Most of the time, though, it isn't.   The AI seems fine, nothing extraordinary. No complaints or accolades yet.  All in all, if you liked MoO2, you'll like this one. If you're a MoO2 purist, though, believing that any successful sequel must copy it exactly (except updated graphics or what have you)...then maybe not. Although it really DOES feel like that to me, honestly.  ",

An addendum: a lot of people think the tactical combat was the heart and soul of MoO/MoO2. I'm not sure I agree, and it's definitely not a reason to rate the game down.",

I had a few crashes and they were always fixed with the next update to the game and I had 2 or 3 crashes during the turn. On a 1 to 10, I give it an 8 because of slow turns and crashes.",

The gameplay is exactly like other turn based 4Xs; expand, manage, bide your time and plot your enemies demise.   Pros:  - I've never found a space 4X that you can conveinently terraform gas giants into usable planets with worker units.  - Those same workers, Space Factories they are called, can construct planets out of asteroids. That is just cool as hell!  - The voice acting and diplomacy screens are beautiful! Top drawer!

Ah hem! I mean 'Doom Star'. It's very late tech tree but oh man is it satisfying. Suddenly the colony ships I had following my armada weren't even going to be used.... I made the Jedi weeep as I literally shattered the remaining planets my enemies held.   Cons: -The AI to autobuild in your dozens of colonies is terrible. It kept pushing me into a deficit on the imperial level! It was unusable until the endgame as a race that doesn't use food when the autobuild decided to build each farming upgrade. -The main starmap looks terrible.

The devs are really quick to respond and I enjoyed the game overall, I would say it's a worthy successor of the MoO2 classic. I haven't played MoO3 so I can't compare to that.  Pros: - Great support from the devs; - Nice graphics; - Has almost everything from MoO2; - Has better diplomacy and spy features; - Military outposts: you don't need a fleet to guard your borders.  Minor cons: - No hero units; - No colony bases (in MoO2 you could colonize a planet in the same system without colony ship, here you always need to have a colony ship); - No freighters for the galaxy food delivery. On the other hand, the food isn't such a big issue as it was in MoO2;  Cons: - No antares. The biggest military challenge is the Orion guardian, and once you can beat that you don't have much left to do unless you're into conquering the whole galaxy. Of course you can beat them economically or technologically but it would be great to have that ultimate goal to wipe the bad guys.   ===================== My original review =============================   TL;DR: Great game, too bugged. Don't waste your money.  I've read those negative reviews, but I thought 'what the heck, it's MoO successor and everyone deserves a chance' and there was the steam sale. At start the game was great, I know that everyone was expecting something on the MoO2 grade but though noone can beat the classic this game was ok. I really enjoyed the first steps, setting up your home system, spy network that works, the auto-scouts, the warp entrance military posts - it all sounded great. But once I hit a certain point the game just froze on the 'stuck on processing turn'. Ok, I started a new game, bla-bla, once I encountered Mrr'shan (or what's their name) ambassador it froze. Ok, third time's a charm, another ambassador, froze again.  So no, despite the fact that this game has a lot of potential and I did love it when it didn't freeze I just can't play it because of it getting randomly frozen. And since it's not like a 'reload and it goes away' freeze but the 'reload and freeze on the same spot' freeze it's just unplayable.",
