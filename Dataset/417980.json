Personally, I find this even funner than Galak and that was supposed to be this month's big game. Surprised I haven't heard of Planet Diver sooner. Definitely give it a shot if you been wanting a very fast paced game that has you falling through caverns. That's really where this game shines in my opinion. Just how fast it is. I been wanting something like this for quite a little while now. It's rather cheap so why not give it a go?",
