Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!  UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything.   Pros: Kinda fun at times  Cons: Too easy Broken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join) Framerate drops  Just no  UPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!",

Perhaps if you fix it, it might be worth your time.",

You're a gumboy, which is basically a ball that can stick to surfaces, also the gumboy is able to jump.  Your goal in the game is to collect more diamonds than your opponent does. You can play vs bots, local vs a friend or online. Mind you though, there probably won't be any player online to play.  Gumboy Tournament is a neat party game, especially for kids but you probably get bored with it pretty quickly. The game is cheap (normal price: 2 bucks, in a steam deal it could be 0,30 cents) which is the right price for the game but in my opinion it's not enough to recommend this game.   ",
