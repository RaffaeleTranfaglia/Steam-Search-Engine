            "review_text": "'Hustle Cat' is a true gem among visual novels, that are currently available on Steam. I absolutely adore this game. That being said, if you are interested in buying it, there are two things you need to consider. First of all, it's short. When you look at my playtime (add 1 or 2 hours for offline), you should know, that it took me that little to finish the WHOLE game (all six routes). Another thing is that decisions have very slight impact on the game, they are pretty much limited to choosing the character you will end up with. And while each route presents new scenes with your 'chosen one', the overall storyline remains the same, no matter who will you pick. I write about it here, because even though, usually, I considered things like that a flaw, that didn't bother me at all with this game.    Great things:",

            "review_text": "Disclosure: A couple of the development staff are friends of a friend of mine and she has been hounding me to check out Hustle Cat for literal months, even though she knows I'm not terribly fond of dating sims. In the time between her telling me about the game and me actually buying it, the evolution of my reaction to Hustle Cat kind of went like this: skeptical → willing to humor a good friend → confused by how intrigued I actually got → pleasantly surprised → oh no I'm crying → MY LIFE HAS BEEN RUINED  The one negative of this game I encountered was that there are still some bugs that need to be ironed out; the Steam overlay doesn't work and the game crashed on me three times. However, the game autosaves at basically every decision menu and scene change, so crashes don't set the player back too much.  If you enjoy cats, likeable characters, an interesting plot, great dialogue, cats, lovely art, great UX design, the ability to play a nonbinary protagonist, and cats, this is the game for you.  11/10 would battle rust with trash again",

            "review_text": " (A briefer summary of it all will be at the bottom, in case you don't wanna go through a full essay!)   Hustle Cat doesn't really have what you'd call a proper  gameplay  exactly, though you could say the same about several other members of the Visual Novel genre, and I can name several that still don't give you as many options and interaction as Hustle Cat does, even if the ones it gives are a little bit light. It's definitely not for you if you're not a fan of text-heavy games, but you'll be right at home if you're into that stuff, or if you're looking to start!  With that in mind, Hustle Cat happens to have a WONDERFUL set of characters, a pretty engaging plot, and overall just really, really nice writing! The way characters are written and their dialogue is laid out is done in a way that you really don't see very often in several games, and though I absolutely liked some more than others, there truly weren't any characters I disliked at all. Avery, the protagonist, is an easy example of splendid characterization, and their interactions with the cafe's staff are really fun to read and enjoyable to go through.  I will say there were a couple of routes were things were handled a little bit strangely, and some certainly feel like they received less attention than others, although that tends to be mostly in the pictures department rather than in writing. General favoritism is there, but this isn't to say that the ones that were noticeably better liked by Date Nighto weren't amazing to play through!  It's easy to catch wind of how to go through each route, and though runs past your first might be a little bit uneventful on your way to taking on another one, the fact you can speed up doesn't really let that drag for too long.   I do wish that the whole 'cat' aspect of the game, which is the lead appeal, hadn't been dropped the way it was, though, but that might just be me. I'll give them a TON of praise for using the word 'witch' as unisex, though! You hardly see people realizing it's unisex in most games these days!    Moving on to the music, I can say it was...all right! Nothing really stood out to me, and most of the songs began as generic before shifting to repetitive, but I wouldn't say they ever got grating or annoying to listen to, and some were very much perfect for the mood, at times. ...Big emphasis on 'at times', though, as there were tons of moments through the game where I felt as though a change in song or maybe a bit of silence would've been much better suited (almost expected) for what the text was carrying the mood through. It definitely took away from some scenes, for me.  Next, we have the art! And boy, Hustle Cat is PRETTY! The character expressions might be a little awkward rarely, but I usually found them to be really nice and fun to look at! The mugshot models themselves are really nicely shaded, with thick lines and great color choices that keep everything vibrant, cute, and just really...alive! Each character gets a very nice and decent selection of expressions as well, which keeps the text accompanying them always engaging!  If there's anything to complain about, it'd be that certain of the special event pictures tend to have awkward faces or anatomy at times, and then you have some others that just don't have shading at all, which I found really strange. These aren't so many that it'd damage the overall quality, though.  The interface is kind of generic for what you'd expect of a visual novel, and can be a little plain here and there, but it's definitely not unfitting or clashing with the style. It's cute, simple, and not pretentious or intrusive, so I can't complain at all.  One thing I absolutely wanna praise is the game's auto save feature! While it's not good advertising to say that the game crashed on me twice, it did happen at times when I was speeding through the dialogue, and my laptop happened to also be running several other things at the time. But, thanks to the auto saving, I really didn't need to worry, since I could just hop back onto where I was just playing last time!   Overall!",

            "review_text": "It is an otome, if you like otomes you will probably like this one. If you do not, then it is likely not a game meant for you. It is a more PG otome, so do not expect explicit.  I have played all the routes (and got the achievements) and I find it was a great decision to have you play through all of the others before getting to Graves, who gives you a larger explanation as to what is going on. The art is cute, the characters are likeable, and act III has some good intensity to it. If you like the story and characters, it has replay value.  My only criticisms are I wish it had been a little longer to dedicate to the relationship building. As it is, it is fine, but it is not the longest game. I also wish there was some voice acting, as I feel it gives more life to the characters, but I also understand that means more time, more employees, and more money involved. My last is the antagonists’ motivation (which I will not spoil here). I feel it could have been something more substantial.  Either way, it is a fun cute story with good characters. As I said, if you like PG otomes with a bit of a weird flair to them, you will like this.",

I did find some characters more interesting than others, and some endings left me feeling truly happy. That being said the final ending left me still wondering what had gone down between the antagonist and Graves, and that route was also kind of meh worthy overall in my opinion, it was nice seeing more of Graves and getting some better answers about what was going on, but overal I was still left wanting. I can't help but wonder if the game had gotten more money when it was on kickstarter it would feel more complete to me. Perhaps, perhaps not, but either way what is here is overall satisfying even if it leaves me wanting more time with these characters.",

When viewing illustrations including Avery you can choose between all of their different presentations which is nice but the banner covers a lot of the image so a big chunk actually gets cut out, unless you can disable the banner though which I'm not aware of.

I enjoyed every bit of it!!  - Incredible art -- It's very pretty, the only issue I had was that all the ending CGs were only views of the character's backs...? It would have been nice to see more variety in poses for the ending CGs... But otherwise I'm not complaining since we get to kiss everyone heh   Could be improved:  - Skipping. I was initially confused by the skipping feature because... It's slow. I thought maybe it was an 'auto' button instead but it felt a bit too fast to be that either. The skipping feature also made it hard to tell when you encounter new/unread text because it's only a tad slower than the skipping speed. It would be nice if the skipping is faster and skips over sprite transitions, but stops immediately upon encountering new text. Just my advice?  - Personal opinion but I felt the romance feels a bit rushed. Then again I don't think Avery has spent enogh time at the cafe within the game to develop the romance more? Or it could be because after skipping through most of the common route I slowly stopped feeling as much for the characters... --  I finished the game in about 9 hours apparently? And that's including (long) toilet breaks. Honestly speaking I wouldn't have paid $20 but now that it's on sale it's definitely worth grabbing!! Overall still a pleasant experience! :)  Personal play order was Mason, Finley, Hayes, Landry, Reese, Graves. I suggest leaving Reese for last to unlock Graves.
