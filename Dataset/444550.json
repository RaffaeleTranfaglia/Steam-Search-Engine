Played on mouse and keyboard and felt that the controls were nice and responsive. Pretty good replay value, though it's missing that little addictive spark that keeps me coming back to games like this.  All of that said it's the kind of game where you stop playing and don't really feel the need to come back it. It's actually a game that I wouldn't mind having on my mobile phone because of the pickup and play nature but I don't think it really provides enough value for the price.",
