The game is difficult, but the level design is extremely good and the game worth its small price.Ethan: Meteor Hunter has good ideas, but it lacks variety of challenges and its control is imprecise.Ethan: Meteor Hunter is a solid platformer, but it lacks the character and exceptionality.If you like this kind of games, especially those harder than the average puzzle/platformer, it well deserves a try. However, it fails to show any outstanding feature. Overall 6/10.",

            "review_text": "It's not very good; by no means mechanically broken, or glitchy, but theres no inspiration or innovation to be found in this title.  You play as a mouse/rat (whichever has the long tails) and you run through platfoming levels, collecting coi..I mean 'fragments' and the gimmick is that every so often you pick up these pause items. All these allow you to do is pause the game mid action and move around blocks similar to how the Wizard in Trine and Trine 2 can.  I'll admit I didn't give this game more than an hour or so, but I really could not keep playing after that.  If you're a hardcore puzzle platformer, sure pick this up for a kick, but I'd advise waiting for a REALLY good sale on it.",

            "review_text": "This is a platformer with puzzle elements, consisting of pausing the fast-paced jump-and-avoid-action to very methodically place wooden blocks to form stairs, bridges and whatnots. The idea is cool enough, but the pause-and-action-system really screws up the immersion. It's a few hours of pretty solid gameplay, but most of the time it isn't very fun, just annoying. The puzzles aren't that hard; they require more luck than anything.   4/10, I'd say.",

        {
            "review_text": "Fairly difficult but mostly fair platformer which introduces logic puzzles by pausing time and allowing you to reorganize certain platforms in order to get over obstacles. The game seems fairly simplistic at first but don't let that fool you it gets a lot harder going forward.  The controls are fairly precise but if you don't have anti ghosting keyboard you will be frustrated quite a bit as sometimes you have to both slide jump and direct at the same time which may not work so well if your keyboard can't register them all. The graphics are fairly simple but that works well, the music is decent but nothing to write home about. Levels are varied quite well along with the puzzles so you won't find yourself bored. Until you hit a wall that is.  Typically through the levels you will have check points and failing only resets you back to the last checkpoint. However, bosses don't have any checkpoints, so you will be forced to replay the whole thing over and over. At first this is not so bad, but later on when you encounter guided missile/bombs it becomes a nightmare.  Overall, a fairly good platformer which could have done things better but you should still check it out if you like that type of games. I'll warn you right away it is hard to finish so if that's a put off don't buy it. 8/10",
