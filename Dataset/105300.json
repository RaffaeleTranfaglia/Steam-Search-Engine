Not the way it plays, but more like the fact that it`s a time killer, it`s ment for you to play like 10 minutes, and then come back to it.  The game is about maching colloured blocks, that are stuck in a cluster in the middle. There are some power ups like a time slower and a multiplier, which will come in handy.   Overall the game is really fun, and there are tons of modes to play. Of couse the goal are the same, but it becomes a bit more of a challenge, when the timer you have to work on is halved!  The problem I have with this game, is that I find it boring, much faster than many other time killer games. I don`t really know what it is. Maybe it`s the play still or the presentation, that gets me off  I give this game a thumps up. 4 out of 10",

To me that is amazing, I mean... touch screens are usually so finnicky and unreliable, and as a society we have used computers for decades, we've been brought up on them! But Critical Mass is actually hard to play using a mouse... A touch screen would make this game great.  Props to the developer for thinking of a playstyle that would be completely at home on the huge boon of tablet devices out there today.  On steam? Yeah it's alright. Time based, 3D match 4 game. Match 4 blocks, they explode. Clear the board before the mass of blocks goes critical and blows you up (I'm guessing that's what happens). Feels awesome, looks awesome (fantastic UI) and has worldwide leaderboards for each level and game mode. As stated, it's finnicky to play, but rewarding, and I could see some people really getting into it.",

Critical Mass is an action puzzler in which the player races to eliminate all of the colored puzzle pieces by placing incoming pieces straegically to connect four connecting colors. Despite the description, it's not particularly 'innovative.' The game is similar in style to something like Tetris in which you have to manage the incoming colors in order to reduce size before it reaches, well, critical mass. Everything works smoothly, and the menus are swift. All works together perfectly to keep you in the action. I only have two complaints for this game. First, the player is unable to rotate the shape (it slowly rotates on its own), so the camera angle can sometimes obscure the best place to insert a block. Secondly, every time I lauch the game on my MBP, it searches all available drives - I launch and then my optical drive fires up. I have no idea why this would ever be necessary for this game (or any other). Regardless, it's loads of entertainment for the prce. 12/13",

            "review_text": " tl;dr -&gt; Match 3 game that reminded me of my childhood playing with those lego-like voxels in elementary school. 11/10 nostalgia feels good.   I got this game gifted to me by a generous friend and was excited to play it because I enjoy match 3 games, especially any that try to do the genre in a novel way. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience.  If you like the match 3 genre, score attacks, and playing on a 3D-plane, then you will enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are simple but nice - you are playing with different-colored blocks in a space theme. The music is nice and calming (drum &amp; bass-like), however, there is only one track, so I quickly muted it and used my own. You can listen to the track on the store page video to know what you'll be listening to.   The controls are very simple - everything is done with the mouse. There is a brief tutorial popup when you start playing, however, I feel that a bit more information could have been provided. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with match 3 games and speed at searching/scanning.   Gameplay consists of you rotating a jumble of blocks around while adding a single block with every mouse click. Feedback will always be given on what color the block will be. Although it is a match 3 genre, you need to actually connect 4 blocks of the same color before they are eliminated. Chaining longer combos will give you a higher score multiplier. More importantly, larger combo chains will give you more time - the blocks move closer and closer to the screen (your time limit). Every time you clear blocks, the jumble will move back a distance depending on how big your combo was. As the jumble comes closer, the edges will turn red to signal that you are about to lose; the music will also stop and the blocks will start shaking.   An interesting element is how ONLY same colored blocks will be eliminated when you match a minimum of 4 blocks. I initially thought that any pieces that were separated from the main body would also be destroyed - they actually stay floating in space. This is a cool concept because it allows you to try creative ways to achieve larger combos. When you eliminate a color, you will not spawn it until the next level.  There are a variety of game modes to play: classic, survival, meditation, and rush. Classic mode is your typical match 4 setup - powerups charge depending on the length of your combo. The three powerups include a score multiplier, slowing down time (jumble moves toward screen slower), and a mass reducer (I believe this allows the pieces to exceed past the screen, which would normally cause you to lose). Survival mode periodically adds more blocks to your jumble. Meditation mode is a more relaxed experience and a good way to just play around. Rush mode constantly subtracts from your total score, forcing you to act quickly.  Overall, the game is a great title in the match 3 genre, and anyone interested in score attacking and being challenged should give this a try.  Recommend!  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",

            "review_text": "I hate bashing on Ozzie companies. ;p And this isn't an evil, unplayable game. My first impression was good, I played it for a bit, expected to play more, had it installed forever, yet every time I fire it up, I close it after 5 minutes.  It's a match 3 game with some 3D tetris elements. The concept is good. The graphics are polished. The music isn't bad. The controls feel annoying at first, but they're actually mostly okay. The problem is, the gameplay doesn't feel satisfying. It expects (and rewards, scorewise) big combos and long term strategy. It also expects you to be fast and responsive. This should theoretically work, in that zen-like way games like this work, but it doesn't. The rythym and pacing feels all off, it feels like the speed jumps from 1,2,3,4,5 to 50 to 150. Once you get into the zone and start planning ahead for later big score combos, it feels like you blink and the game jumps speed, asking you to go for quick, 'just don't make a mistake' placement. That may be totally subjective of course, or it could be that the feeling gets exacerbated by the clunky cube placement process. It simply isn't visually always obvious or easy to correctly target the location you want on a constantly rotating cube, which really hurts the game when it picks up speed. People misplace blocks on tetris too, but usually feel it's their fault, here it feels like the cube jumps place three times before you can be sure it's where it should be. By which time the game has jumped two speed gears and you're basically done with.  Again, not a bad game, in theory. I just never feel like playing it long, because it doesn't feel very enjoyable. The thumbs down is just trying to balance a 'very positively' reviewed game, with an 80 something metacritic score that few people seem to actually play much (notice the curiously short play times of the majority of the positive reviewers?). So I'd suggest to approach with caution, and at least play the demo first.",

The game doesn't even provide basic gameplay elements like a heads up about what the next color is so you can strategize accordingly.
