This game is definitely not as good as Limbo (which should be 5 stars for sure) though I'll still put a RECOMMENDED.  However, after playing the last level, I would give this game at most 3 stars. I don't see any rationality that you don't put any checkpoint in the last level. It's kind of boring when I know all the tricks but still need to try a lot of times to pass the level. If you go to Limbo, there's nowhere that you know the tricks but still need a lot of luck to go through.  I spent 4 hours on the game but more than one hour on the last level. I really felt annoyed after the 10th try.",

And it is a lot like Limbo indeed, but the lacking story, annoying visuals (like hidden caves that remain hidden until you stumble into them) and puzzles that have more to do with timing jumps than thinking left me feeling disappointed.",

It has the similar feel, but this game is a little bit lighter in terms of its graphics. The puzzles are also good so far, I haven't finished it yet, but this is one of the hidden gems I'd definitely recommend to a friend who loves puzzle and platforming games.",

Beautiful art together with the music makes amazing gameplay experience against logic puzzles.  The non-verbal story is also attractive as you can decide on your own what really happens in the Toby's world. It's worth to play it, as this adventure is somehow unique and personal, even if it's inspired by Limbo so much.  Good work!",

I have played Limbo and Toby is far from it but in this case the silhouette and awesome atmospheres works very well together, I spent over an hour playing Toby the other day and felt like I could keep on going forever!",

Jumping is the single mechanic you have and it doesn't feel good. Lastly, most punishing platformers like this make death interesting/entertainment in some way to make up for the frequency. However, it's not interesting in this game. A lot of times it's obfuscated by the world element that killed you.   I think there's potential here for something good, but as it stands I'm not having fun.",

Some feats could be improved like flagging missing friends over tree level.",
