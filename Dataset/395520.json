The graphics would be acceptable if there was any sort of depth to the game aside from the puzzles, but there isn't. It's clear that the artist put lots of good work into creating environments that will never need to be looked at. And the puzzles themselves were not paid any particular attention, even though they are the core of the game.   Some parts of the map appear as if they can be unlocked as the game progresses, but that's just to trick the player into thinking there's more.    All in all, you essentially get what you pay for: nothing.",

Puzzles 9-10: 'Oh, I might have to start thinking about these puzzles soon.' Puzzle 11: 'Okay, I got this...' Cat hops up on table, walks around perimeter of table, gets back in my lap. Puzzle 13: I start not getting the puzzles right on the first try. Cat keeps repeating table-circle-lap thing. Puzzle 17: Am having to really think about these puzzles and try a few times. Cat doesn't know if he wants to be on my lap, on the table, or both. Puzzle 18: Cat is meowing from my lap for attention. 100 percent of it. Puzzle 19: Throw cat off my lap to work on puzzle. Cat jumps back up. Puzzle 20: 'Gonna finish this, yeah!' Cat is insistently banging his face against mine regardless of response in order to get attention. Puzzle 24: Cat gives up after repeatedly insisting that 'Meaaah' and 'mrrrah', goes to living room. Puzzle 25: Victory!  Start typing review of game: cat pukes on living room rug.

            "review_text": "Oh man, I really really wanted to love this game. The promise of a new language via pictograms really got me interested, and I began the game eagerly. Sadly enough, the game had about 10 'words' or concepts in shapes you could make on an Android lock screen. They aren't bad, but they're so limiting when there's no point to learning them. There's only a single puzzle that requires any understanding of them and that one isn't even words, it's based on numbers.   It's a remarkably detailed world for being greyscale, so it was nice to look at. The music was fantastic, but the loop was surprisingly short. I know I heard the same music sequence multiple times and I played almost two hours. That isn't a long time, but the music shouldn't be so obviously repetitive.   The entire 'plot' of the game is in two cut scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end. That's it. They're maybe two minutes combined, so plot is thin on the ground. This game focuses mostly on its puzzles, though. They're simplistic, and, honestly, boring. The first few levels of the puzzles (there are 3 types and 25 levels each) were interesting because you had to figure out what to do and once you had it, there was a definite 'Aha!' moment. But after you understood, it was easy, almost painfully so.  This game could really use more to it. It's a great base, and honestly, I have no idea why it won all those awards. It isn't terrible, per se, but it feels like a demo, not the full game. If you were interested in the language part, don't even bother. If you like puzzles, don't bother. If you want plot-- that's right, don't bother. It just isn't worth your time investment when it gives you nothing in return. If it had more language like it promised, it might be worth it, but as it is, it just isn't.",

If you also find this helpful or not leave a rating!  Overview: Missing Translation is a pixel, puzzle, indie game, that’s free to play and over all is very good. It offers a good hour or two, depending on how good you are at solving puzzles. The game has a unique story, which I found to be interesting. The game play is simple and the puzzles are pretty simple, a little hard towards the end of them. The graphics fit well with the game, I couldn’t see it be anything other than pixels. Some other things included are steam achievements, 6 in total which are all possible to get in one play though. I personally was able to get all 6 and I can now add this game to my 100% completed list. Lastly, there’s no language needed to understand this game, it’s all symbols, so anyone can just download it and play.  Genre: Missing Translation is a puzzle game that offers 3 different types of puzzle for you to complete. Each type has 25 puzzles you can complete, this totals to 75 puzzles to complete. The puzzles are pretty simple and start off easy at first, then they start to get harder and harder towards then end. I personally liked all 3 different types of puzzles and I was able to complete at 75 puzzles in one play though. The only downfall I could find to these puzzles is it’s a bit repetitive towards the end and they could off added some more. Also if you’re not good at puzzles or just don’t have the patience to take your time and solve them, you might find the last few to be a bit hard. But other than those couple reasons it’s a very good free to play puzzle game.  Graphics: Missing Translation is a pixel and black and white game at its heart. The graphics work very well with the game and I couldn’t see the game using any other type of graphics. I love the graphics personally and I couldn’t find any flaws with it. Overall the pixels and the black and white theme really work well with the game and add to its charm.  Game play: The game play for Missing Translation is really simple, first move around the area you’re in, then just come across doors that take you to puzzles. After that you complete the puzzles and move on to the next ones, very simple. As you do this, the story will revival intersecting plots in its self. I won’t talk about the story; due to it being simple and you should download the game and just see it for you. The controls are simple, just moving around and a activate key. Overall the game play is simple and works very well for this game.  Content: Missing Translation offers about 1 to 2 hours of game play, depending on how good at puzzle games you are. There are 3 different types of puzzles, totaling up to 75 puzzles, for you to complete. There are also 6 steam achievements that you can get; these are all possible to get on your first play though.   Cons/Let Downs: Missing Translation is a fast game that only offers a couple of hours at most. The only thing this game lacks is content. Without more content there’s really no point to replay it after you beat the game and get all the steam achievements. Other than that little thing, this game is a little gem.  Would I recommend this game? I would totally recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games or indie games that offer a new type of game you haven’t seen before. If like puzzles you are going to love this game. Also if you are looking for a free game to get all the steam achievements for, this is a great game to do that with. I would recommend this game for anyone looking for a great free to play game! ",

All you need to know is shown on the first seconds of the game: you were abducted and need to find parts of a machine to go home. As you search for the machine parts you need to solve puzzles, and each puzzle makes it clear what you need to do. Overall you got 3 kinds of puzzle and 25 levels in each plus an extra in decoding symbols (find the scientist) Aparently there might be some extra content in the future but for nopw it can be finished in under 2 hours (and I did look a lot around trying to see if there was something else). The idea is nice but it gets a bit repetitive as you advance on each puzzle, maybe more kinds and less lvls could be more fun.  So if you like puzzles and paterns go for it. ",
