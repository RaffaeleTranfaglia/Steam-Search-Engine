It's food!  Environment wants to kill you. Environment wants to help you! You must be careful - You never know who is really helpful and who is tricking you.   Final scene of the game is mind blowing! Yet... you must find out for yourself about this :)",

            "review_text": "  What a lovely game Selma and the Wisp is. As you can see from my playtime, you can finish the game in about 2 hours, maybe even faster. But the price is fair for the story and the challenge that the game offers.  Although the control of the girl is a little bit tricky with the wisp, most of the time I had no problem to play the game. As a great bonus, the game offers solid setting options for resolution, graphics quality and 4 options for your prefered soundmix.  So, from the crafting side and the game itself is a solid product which I can recommend without hesitation!",
