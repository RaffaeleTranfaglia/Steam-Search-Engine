            "review_text": "I must say I ended up being somewhat disappointed. In case you never heard of this, it's a turn based roleplaying game set in a post apocalyptic world, extremely similiar to Fallout (the original Wasteland 1 is the spirtiual predecessor to Fallout). It offers a very good amount of content and great athmosphere. The world is well built and interesting. The story is ok (you pretty much just help local folks, the big bad only rears its ugly head every few hours for a line or two) - it's a game that is living more off the lore than off the plot, which is totally fine (see for an excellent example: Morrowind). The disappointing part is everything else. The attribute and skill system is just bad. There are only 3 viable character builds attribute wise. Attributes are completely detached from skills, so the only thing attributes concern is combat. So there are strong guys who can walk fast (melee) and guys who can shoot well and often (sniper) and intelligence chars who suck at combat but get more skills (skill donkey).   There are a ton of skills, for example lockpicking, animal whispering or mechanical repair, as you'd expect from a RPG. But the difficulty scaling of skill checks is made in such a way that you need expert characters to keep up with the skill checks. So every character just gets 2 skills you'll dump all your skill points in every few levels. There is no customization or thinking involved in building a character after it is created and you start the game. Every level is just new skill points you have to spend in the same skills every time. Terribly boring. The skill checks themselves also ultimately become boring as hell, because every single chest in the game is locked AND trapped. It just becomes an annoying chore to disarm and open it. The reward is usually just 3 bullets of ammo and a bit of junk to vendor off. You'll also constantly come across containers with only 10-30% success chance. Prepare for the exciting meta gameplay of quicksaving and then trying and reloading as long as it takes to finally open the junk. Or simply ignoring it. But at least early on, the game is balanced around you really going after every scrap. Later on it becomes irrelevant instead.  And the biggest problem, the combat system is very very bad. It looks like another take on the tried and true Jagged Alliance/XCOM formular. Only it's the blandest iteration I've seen so far. There are no skills, no classes. There is just one type of cover. At the end of the day there is nothing to do but just sit down all your chars behind a wall and keep firing at the nearest enemy until the fight is over. By the end I didn't even bother with cover anymore. I just left my guys standing in a big blob where the combat started and kept shooting. That's how dumb the combat here is. The maps also only very rarely offer interesting tactical opportunities. Most maps seem to have been made with aesthetics in mind and not tactics. Blackguards for example was WAY more inventive here, where you could clearly tell that the designers hand crafted every encounter and tried to get a unique twist out of every battle. In Wasteland it's just cannon fodder fights with a random fence you can use as cover if you want, or not, it won't make much of a difference.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible game. What kept me going was exploring the world and seeing how the small surviving communities in this world worked. Still, I can't help but feel terribly disappointed over the massively wasted potential on display here.",

            "review_text": "Wasteland 2 is a decent CRPG, but it's lacking in the depth that FO1 and 2 offered.  The character creation is intimidating at first, but the manual will explain things. For the most part it avoids having any single attribute as a dump stat, although charisma and luck come close. The skill system could use some work. Three dialogue skills is two too many, and a lot of non-combat skills are just various ways to open loot crates, although there are several cases where high repair or demolitions are needed to progress in a quest. Strangely, your attributes only affect your derived stats - the majority of which are sadly hidden from you - but have no effect on your skills.  Combat is a huge part of this game, and while it is fun it's also rather simple. It uses a turn based system similar to Fallout, but you get control of each member of your party. There's an ambush attack similar to overwatch from XCOM which is pretty useful, but there aren't any aimed shots except for headshots, which are pretty boring. The weapons are seriously imbalanced, with assault rifles becoming really good about 1/3 of the way through, and godlike in the end-game.  The quest design is decent; there are a handful of major quests in both areas of the game that are pretty complex and fulfilling to solve but the majority of them are short and combat focused. The quests in the first half are more polished while the back half feels rushed and incomplete.  Wasteland 2 is worth playing especially if you loved the old Fallout games and wish Van Buren was real. A word of warning: the game can still have some pretty poor performance even if you meet recommended specs.",

            "review_text": "I had been looking forward to this game's release for a long time. A lot of things were done quite well. I liked the general setting and story outline and the fact it used turn based combat, but there are a huge number of letdowns in this game.     Plot. I think it's supposed to feel immersive, but I just didn't feel like it was. Other than radio messages and a couple of places overrun by end-boss henchmen, nothing connects the end of the game to the start or middle. There is no feeling of building to an epic conclusion. The side-quests are fine.     Skills. There is hardly any synergy between stats.Your Computer Science skill character for example, his intelligence level is irrelevant on skill checks... that makes no sense. I think it would have been much better to keep skills more closely linked with stats. Partly I think this has happened because of the ludicrous number of skills/stats. There is just no point in having safecracking, lock-picking and alarm disabling as separate skills. Less skills, less stats, less skill points and this problem would have gone away. Also, especially the stats feel very ineffectual, each char might get 2 or 3 points to allocate throughout the game. What can you get for them? Not a lot.     Skill-checks. I'm guessing there are 2 kinds of players, ones who try and fail to open lockboxes/doors/safes and accept that and move on (potentially to lobbing grenades at it) or ones who will save/reload until it opens. The system in place does not really handle it that well for either. The randomness is just a complete waste of time. If the former type of player got to a box and the tooltip says the skillcheck is too low, that would be fine, they could move on. If the latter type of player did the same, ditto. It's just making busy work for people who want to explore event inch of the game and open all the chests. Later in the game there are chests that will be 20% chance to open with maximum Lockpicking + Luck... what is the point in that? If it's supposed to be because sometimes in lfe you can't overcome a challenge... then just make it that you find lockboxes which can't be opened at all.     Using skills. There is no reason for it to take several seconds to try and fail/succeed to perform some action, especially if you have to do it several times in succession. Mine fields are a prime example... Quicksave, right-click, disarm, wait, wait, wait, repeat. How tedious. Combine near instant usage with some absolute (i.e. not random) skill-check like I describe in (3) and it would have made the game a lot less annoying.     Combat - Tactics. This is perhaps the biggest letdown. There is no excuse for this at all, the combat is incredibly dull and you inevitably start to feel like your trying to trick the game's AI instead of trying to waste some raiders.     Combat - Positioning. This could have had a big effect on most battles, making them more tactical and thus more interesting, but in the majority of cases (especially in the end-game battles) the bad guys are entrenched and you come in the door and the battle (or cut scene leading to battle) begins. It would have been a lot better if there was some kind of stealth skills that you could have used to get into better positions. Also, it would have been great if there was a way to tell whether you were in an NPCs line of sight so trying to position your squad cleverly wasn't an annoying save-reload procedure.     Combat - Cover. I like cover, it's a fun mechanic, however, because of the positioning, often by the time you reach it you could have already won. The last few battles I felt were pretty crap tactically because it was almost impossible to make decent use of cover. Also, if you have any melee characters, obviously they can't really make use of cover so should be appropriately armoured...     Combat - Melee/Brawl. ... which they aren't. My blunt weapons dude was maxxed out on strength with all the armor and constitution and crit dmg reduction perks... he was still a ridiculously easy target. In the end game, if he got into melee range before being killed that was a surprise. Massively disappointing. Made worse by...     Combat - Armor. ... the fact that heavy armor makes you slower. Ok, that makes some sense, however it makes melee chars slow (especially as they'd have to have taken high strength to be useful at the cost of other stats, like speed) and thus less able to get into position to pummel the enemy. I get that having the whole squad in (enclave) power armor (FO2 stylee!!) doesn't make a lot of sense, but combat speed was the stupidest thing to reduce when wearing it. Much better would have been a loss of coordination or evasion. You can make it RP by saying that it's like mech armor, giving them more speed to make up for the heavy armor. In the end-game, melee is almost completely useless as there are snipers who can take them out in a couple of shots. Conductive armor... this is a stupid idea, if you are struck by lightning/energy weapons, the best thing you could be wearing was a huge suit of power armor as the faraday cage effect would ensure the wearer remain unscathed, it's basic physics. This all basically means you have to carry 2 sets of armor around per person to ensure you can change when a battle will be energy weapon heavy. This is a massive hassle and adds very little to the game. I think it would have been better if the novel use of energy weapons was that they were less applicable to precision strikes (for obvious reasons), but overall a little more powerful than regular weapons to compensate. Make them a little better against robots and a little less against biological targets, by all means. Having your energy weapons guy be almost entirely useless for the first half of the game... great!     Combat - Followers. Maybe these guys aren't meant to last long in combat? When they 'bum-rush' the enemy in every fight you either do a lot of save/reloading to keep them alive, or just let them die and get on with it. Kind of a pity.     Combat - Healing. Given that in any tough fight, unless your party is 100% snipers and assault rifles, people will have to move in closer, and will get incapacitated... Having the surgeon get to them is nearly always impossible in combat as it takes more than 1 round to get them back on their feet, in which time the surgeon will almost certainly be out in the open and gunned down. Also, you use surgeon to get people back on their feet after a fight, great... but now they have a real-time (some are 600 seconds!!), unremovable debuff reducing their stats. What is that for? Mandatory bathroom breaks? All it does is introduce an annoying time delay before you can go into combat again.      Weapon types - Nobody wanted to use weapons other than sniper/assault rifles right? Oh, you did? Well, that's too bad because they are pretty crap.     Car - One of the best ideas in Fallout 2. It allowed you to move around the map a lot faster (not a huge Wasteland 2 problem), but more importantly, you had your 'bank' nearby, so when you get to a place you can go and grab that heavy quest item or 'white' item when you find someone who wants it without having to go all the way back to base, then inside the base to the chest, then all the way back again. Definitely should have existed here.   In summary. The game wasn't terrible, but particularly the combat was a big let down. While there are some new things from where Fallout 2 was (oh Marcus... did you just kill 2 of your own party members with your minigun...again!?), this game did not get them right. Given that we're 17 years down the road in terms of game design, it should have been much, much better.",

            "review_text": "This is NOT AT ALL like Fallout 1 and 2 or similar classic CRPGs which offer significant choices and freedom, interesting dialogue, chances to use your creativity.  It's mechanical in the most boring way. You march linearly through a sequence of mostly empty areas. In each area, you do the same tedious and repetitive click-and-wait, which is all minor variations on the following minigame: find box, disarm trap [wait], disarm alarm [wait], unlock lock [wait], unlock tumbler [wait]. The waiting really is excessive. If you accidentally click things in the wrong order, which is guaranteed to happen since the click-wait dance is so boring, the box blows up or the alarm goes off. When you succeed, you get some minor loot. Which you must hold on to forever, because there is only one container in the entire game that you can put things in, and the game tells you things are junk when they might be useful.  Skills are all for boring skill checks like this; too few points, and you'll keep failing and waiting over and over, or have to take the long route through the area. That's too bad, since skills are your only way of interacting with the world outside combat.  Occasionally an area contains a friendly NPC. I guarantee that NPC has nothing interesting to say, and don't expect deep dialogue trees with important and rewarding decisions. Even the writing is boring. Just click all the topics until they go away to update quest status. Then go to some other area, do same tedious boxes-and-combat dance, come back to turn in quest for reward. Your reward is to level up and increase the mandatory weapon and box-opening skills. These are also illusory choices, because if you put points into the wrong skills, you will just be waiting more. It turns out there's one optimal way to make a character, this is impossible to determine before you have played the game or copied the perfect recipe, and if you didn't do it, the game is even more tedious. Unlike Fallout, you can't make weird characters like a a low-intelligence talker character or a nonviolent sleazeball work out. Just restart and build the character in the combat-oriented way you are forced to do.  What this leaves is a ton of unavoidable turn-based combat - which is decent, though simplistic; it mainly tests whether you put enough points into the right gun skills, because several of the gun skills are really not worthwhile.   Please do not buy this game unless turn-based combat is your primary interest. It's a 'tactics' game. If you expect anything else, you'll be disappointed. If what you want is an RPG with choices, run away. There are no real choices. Your choices (such as they are) are morally 1-dimensional, you can't affect the politics or world in any interesting way, and it's not really possible to be bad or even strange. The only thing it is possible to be is a character which marches through the predetermined missions shooting things as intended.",

            "review_text": "I have played both Wasteland 2 and Wasteland 2: Director's Cut. I *really* wanted to like this game, and there are things I do like about this game, but unfortunately they are overshadowed by several design decisiosn that I feel are completely game breaking, decisions that ultimately left me feeling nothing but disappointment.  To get this out of the way first, yes, there were a *lot* of bugs, from graphics not lining up properly, to strange problems with the names of clothing, to crashes to desktop on load, to a horrific problem in Ranger Citadel where attempts to load the game in Ranger Citadel would leave me with a completely crippled interface and the feeling that I had somehow broken the game so much that it would never recover. To be clear, while these were annoyances (yes, even the Ranger Citadel bug for which I eventually found a work-around), none of them were bad enough to actually make me dislike the game.  Also, to get THIS out of the way, I agree that the visual style could have used some work, and the audio definitely left something to be desired, especially the background noises which, in the Ag Center, nearly had me tearing my hair out at one point. But, again, none of this actually made me dislike the game.  Instead, up to a point I liked the game *in spite* of these problems. I liked the combat system. Sure it was relatively light on tactics if I wanted to just plough through encounters, but if I was smart, I could end encounters in one or two rounds. I liked the weapon and armor system well enough. They were definitely servicable, and modding weapons was kind of fun. I liked character customization well enough. The perks and quirks were a nice addition. I also liked some of the rebalancing, and felt like my characters in the DC were better able to handle themselves in a variety of situations than my original Wasteland 2 characters. I liked the plot for a while. I saved Highpool on my original Wasteland 2 playthrough, I saved Ag Center on my DC playthrough, and I liked them both. I liked the Rail Nomads, and the little hidden surprises scattered around the wasteland, including the random encounters. I especially felt good about the number of options I seemed to have for resolving a number of the situations I ran across. It felt good. It felt right. I was pretty happy.  Then I went to prison, and everything went to hell. Suddenly all my options went away. Without spoiling anything, the prison area presents you with little in terms of choices, and it is frustrating. Especially in the DC, I got to the prison with characters that had a lot of options available to them, and yet at the prison they were largely unusable. Further, the logic that the game presented behind *why* I had no options just did not follow. What's worse, the outcome at the prison seems to be the same no matter what you do there. I've searched for an explanation online, only to discover various apologists saying that the development team was trying to hammer home the idea that the wasteland is really terrible. The problem with this argument, of course, is that you do not have to take away player agency to get this point across, and yet this is what we are left with. Confusingly, in earlier versions of this game those choices did exist at the prison, and there seems to be no good explanation as to why they were taken out.  And, unfortunately this is where I had to stop playing both versions of this game. This is when it stopped feeling like a role playing game, and started feeling like a visual novel with some cosmetic combat, and not a particularly interesting or engagine one at that. Is it unfair to judge the entire game based on my experience? Maybe. But I have tried to get back the feeling I had of playing a role playing game, the one that the game still managed to engender early on in my playthroughs, but the immersion has apparently been broken irreparably.  Maybe if I hadn't seen the setting half a dozen times in other games, or if the plot were more unique and engaging, or the gameplay more interesting, or the game less frustratingly buggy, or the graphics more beautiful or the audio less . . . horrific . . . Maybe if these things had been the case it would have carried me through this immersion-breaking area and onward towards the end of the game. And maybe I will still be inspired to play through the rest of the game, experiencing it in its entirety and I will change my tune. But every time I try to play again, I am presented with the fact that my choices in the Prison area will have no impact on the game, not even any HOPE of impact, and then despair sets in and I cannot continue. Not despair over the setting or the plot. Not despair over the fates of the individuals in the Prison area who are doomed because the wasteland is a horrible place. No, my despair is over the poor design decision. I *know* that it could have been a better game, that they could have confronted us with an unforgiving area that showed us how brutal the wasteland can be without taking away our options/choices/agency. But they did not, and so I cannot recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "This is my first review ever here on steam, and never has a game compelled me so much to review it as WL2, so here goes.  Short Review: This is an unfinished game. If we, as players, accept this very low bar of completion as OK, then we will reap the 'rewards'.  In-Depth Review: I think it's important to understand where this game is coming from before criticizing it. Tons of Fallout fans were less-than-impressed when Fallout 3 came out and, despite being promised something other than a re-skinned Oblivion (now Skyrim) got just that.  As such, the hype was huge for a game from the original makers crowdfunded a true sequel with tried-and-tested Firaxis on board. The target of 1 million was met and grew to 3 million dollars. The game won a GOTY award and has been well-received.  That was all I needed, so jumped in and was ready for just such an experience.  I did some reading and carefully crafted characters for the long journey ahead, nevermind thst there's very little in a tutorial to prep you. I'm seasoned gamer, so go!  So I end up roaming the wastes and get random encounters. Some I try, some I try to flee. You get 'caught', and then you're loaded into an instance. The mobs are now romaing about in the instance, not chasing you, and you get to do these a lot unless you have one skill. Same scenarios and maps. Hmmm...is this GOTY material?  Then you get into your first quest to go to X place and do Y things. Along the way, my noob party visited a much higher level area than they were fit for. Hmmm...no warning?  Luckily, we left and didn'tengage our certain death. We went on to the Ag Center. I was woefully unprepared, but managed to survive most of it...until I found myself at an impass: I had tried to crack a safe that has a critical keycard to enter one of the next areas, but I critically failed which essentially bricked the safe, which was the only place where I could get the keycard.  I went on having learned the critical rule of this game: you save about every 2 seconds and keep vast repositories of save lists. Unfortunately, I learned this after i borked the safe with the keycard. Not one to give up, I went on to other areas and did a boss fight where only 2 of my people had ammo left. After about 20 tries, we got the guy without running out of meds for people he wasted.  Now, that's what happened in the game. The combo of ridiculous bosses, minimal resources, and the CRUSHING fact that I might not get the keycard I needed nearly caused me to uninstall.  My reaction to this is now what you might expect, but it's what gets repeated ad nauseum on forums related to this game. I took this as old school. You just have to deal with your decisions. YEAH, and this makes everything more realistic, right? So I left and had my NPC surgeon Rose desert us and picked up Angela Deth, who is great and all but nobody told me i'd need her, and we progressed...  But at the same time, the clunky camera and its limited zoom functions created this 'very atmospheric' sense that I was lost. I was...and just wanting one more level of zoomout as compared to the satellite view in my inventory.  And then you go into a scenario and place your characters just like you want them as you've done a thousand times by this point: in the right position but facing walls.  And this was the point of no return. I just realized that, for all the 'difficulty' you face, the execution is just sucky. I knew that, if enough people complained, patches would fix things,but, I thought to myself for the first time ever, 'THIS is GOTY?'  I stopped blaming myself and started thinking 'these are the problems that justify the existence of play-testers.' Did anyone playtest this game before release? Not based on my experience, and forums suggest I'm not the only one who's had the same problems I've encountered.  AND AND, if you want to see this done right, X-COM does it to near perfection.   Bottom line: the game required a million dollar budget. It got 3 million. In turn, we got something that is still in beta. finished.  I don't blame players who are enjying this, but I'll never trust entities again which have chosen it as GOTY when it's not",

Do not PLAY this game thinking it's Fallout. Wasteland is one thing, Fallout is something completely different. Now lets begin.  Do you like post-apocalyptic lite CRPGs? If you do then this is something you should definately check out. Now when I say 'lite' I do really mean it. This game feels, at times, extremely shallow and simplistic in everything from interactions with the environment, quests, combat and items. Everything is simplified. Yet this still is a good and enjoyable game and worth every penny you spend to buy it. The closest comparison that I can make to this game is Fallout Tactics, which in my opinion was vastly underrated and received way too much flak than it deserved, and I still rate Fallout Tactics higher than this. Character creation is based on the CLASSIC system (whereas Fallout uses SPECIAL) with just attributes and skills. No special perks or traits. You can customize your Rangers appearance, bio and so on but none of that affects your game in anyway. Combat is single squad, turn-based and squared grid layout playing field. Nothing too fancy, straightforward and to the point. You have different guns, bombs and heavy weapons with some different fire modes and ability to try a headshot. The cover system is similiar to the new XCOM Enemy Unknown game with the icon showing cover positions. Quests are typical (somewhat gliche'd) CRPG quests of fetch things, solve problems and make binary choices between factions. Environment is a bit stoic. Things you can interact with can be highlighted with a press of a key and that's about it. Game is full of easter eggs, dark humour and references. This was actually something that really started to annoy me. It feels like in every scene and place you visit is just riddled with them. I mean come on! Candy is nom noms but too much candy makes your stomach hurt.  As a whole Wasteland 2 is a good game. It's not fantastic or rebirth of CRPGs. It's just a good game. Just do not try to compare it to Fallout games. The only things these have in common are Fargo and the post-apocalyptic theme.",

There are a ton of great details that make combat fun and interesting with more than enough skills and attributes to make each point assignment a tough debate.  Perks are sadly missing. That really would have iced the deal. Regardless, you're getting a great script, fun old-school gameplay with some modern tweaks.

It lacks any and all of Fallout's whimsical charm, it forces you to create a squad at the beginning instead of striking out on a lonely, eerie struggle.  Moreover, the game feels like it's high on its own supply. Overhyped, oversold, generally just not ideal for someone who wants an original Fallout experience. There's a big difference between this super serious, staid setting and the wacky retro-future of Fallout.  Honestly, this is like a better verison of Fallout: Tactics at the end of the day. I'm not saying this is a bad game, it's just extremely misleading to compare it to the original Fallout titles. It is NOT like them. No traits, no perks, no color or humor. Not enough attribute and skill points at the beginning for an individual character, since you're supposed to make four. There's no room for character development or finding your own identity. The very first conversation, I'm pushed into saying 'sir' constantly and being a military recruit. Maybe I don't WANT to join the rangers.   Maybe I want to just run out into the wilderness or find a city hub and just make my own path - like I did in Fallout.  I realize everyone is different. But part of the reason I loved Fallout was that my companions had their own minds and I didn't have to micromanage them constantly. It ended up creating hilarious (and sometimes awful) situations in which my companions surprised me in combat. Overall, it was more immersive (to me) because I was focused entirely on my own character, instead of mysteriously mind-controlling a group.  Overall, it's hard to say whether or not I recommend the game. I know some people will love it. But I can't get over the vast disappointment after I was lead to believe, from literally everyone, that this is like Fallout. It's not. Fallout, in my opinion, is way more fun. Mechanically, aesthetically, and otherwise.  Just one woman's point of view. Take it or leave it.",

            "review_text": "Ultimately, Wasteland 2 is an average game that scratches a particular nostalgia itch for many gamers and is receiving praise beyond its merits. Quite frankly, the Turn-based strategy genre has been in a drought for nearly a decade and fans are dying of thirst to the extent they'll lap up contaminated water riddled with disease and ask for seconds. They're so enamored with a sub-standard product they don't recognize they're dying a most dishonorable death from dysentery.  Combat - The combat is lackluster and is not tactical nor strategic in any sense of the fashion. OK Corral gun duels might be more appropriate, except slow and with none of the skill involved. If you want a game with good combat, just replay XCOM2012 or Xenonauts.  Character building - No skill tree, no perks, nothing to be found except redundant skills to simply dump your stat points into every time you level up. If you're looking for the complexity and fun of a D&amp;D style character sheet, keep looking. If you're looking for a Fallout perk system... keep looking. Even Diablo 3, which the avid fans of W2 seem keen to mock, has a far more indepth character building system.  Story - Glaring plot hole at the beginning of the game that most people seem to overlook or simply not notice. Even if you look past that, the only clever aspect of the entire game is the little Easter Eggs you'll occasionally find. However, finding kitty litter, a condom, or big black didlo for the 15th time is just sad. It's funny the first time, but like any good joke, you have to know when to quit effing telling it. If you want a game with a good story, reboot Mass Effect, BG, Fallout... pretty much any other CRPG.  Characters - Easily forgettable and none that will be remembered. No Minsc &amp; Boo, HK-47, Commander Shepards, Irenicus (best villain ever), Tomi Grin Undergallows etc. No Delita or Ramza to be found here. For the most part, they're as bland and lifeless as the Arizona wastes you'll wander around for the first half of the game.   Exploration - Some of the environments are interesting, but with the terrible combat and random loot, much of the fun is taken out of it.  Graphics - The game wasn't trying to inspire us with graphical prowess or eye porn, but what it delivered is unpolished and ugly. Some will argue it's stylistic or gritty, but to each their own.  Sound - Ok, but no gripping musical scores to be found here.  At the end of the day, everything W2 set out to do has been done before (obviously), but done far better.",

Characters randomly transporting all across the map, quests that get stuck or become impossible to complete, with most players getting past the location by killing everyone on the map as the only way to 'complete' the location. Unlike Fallout 1 and 2, you can't 'skip' a town's quests and move on. If you can't complete the quest, the game is permanently stuck. There are so many times I've gone across the whole game map, only to find out that I need to talk to some obscure, random NPC at some location just to 'complete the quest' and open up a new location. Frustration, frustration, frustration. And the game's plot completely lacks all of the dark humor, the biting social satire, and the open-ended adventure of Fallout 1 and 2. Disappointment.",

I came to Wasteland 2 as a Fallout 1/2 fan. The kickstarter was the first time I had heard of Wasteland so I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that it was a combat heavy turn-based strategy game set in a nuclear wasteland. Based on the fact that 'Toaster Repair' is a useful skill made me it assume it had a healthy dose of snark as well.  When I started the game I found out it was both what I expected and entirely different. The interface was more or less exactly what I had expected. The descriptive text and conversations were a lot more detailed than anticipated, but still lived up to expectations. [WARNING: This game has swearing.]  The fact that the interface was as expected made it seem easy to jump right in and start exploring. Wow, was I wrong. The content and difficulty were another beast.  From what I've seen thus far the overall tone is best described as “Dark Attitude”. The rangers aren't lights in darkness, they are flawed individuals who find themselves in the roles of peacekeepers. Its not a game where you get thanked for helping, its one in which those you help will gripe about it taking too long to get there and generally be jerks. Fellow Fallout fans should be prepared for a very different tone.   Contrary to what I expected it was not easy to jump in. I had chosen a party of pregenned characters, thinking they were relatively balanced, and was proven very wrong. This became very obvious in the Ag Center and led to me restarting. Chance to hit was low, ammo usage was high, and eventually I was running around punching everything with characters spec’ed for ranged combat. If you don’t explore everywhere and carefully manage your ammo, you are in for a hard time. Don’t forget your shovel, safe-cracker, and toaster repair expert!  Despite, or perhaps because of, the difficulty, I find myself continually thinking about the game and wondering what is next. If you like turn based combat and don’t mind having to work for victory it is worth getting. Just don’t go in expecting a Fallout clone because its an entirely different game.",

Old-school, pretty long and reasonably hard, with focus more on gameplay than on graphics. Plenty of choices, lots of possible ways to outfit your party, no 'right choice'. You can play as you like, and are actually encouraged to do so. You may very well be locked out from several parts of the game through your choices, but that tends to happen anyway, whichever choice you make. If you really want to see everything the game has to offer, you have to play multiple times, and fortunately the game makes that a viable option as different playthroughs will feel differently.  So I recommend this game on its gameplay merits, but I have to warn new players for the fact that the game, at the moment of this writing, still seems to be in the beta phase. While it has officially been released a month ago, there are plenty of quests in the late game that may still get into an unresolvable state -- this is a consequence of the fact that the player may go anywhere he likes, and thus may get into areas that are quest-related without having got the quest in the first place. There are also quite a few bugs left which may cause a forced reload.   So my recommendation is: if the style of game appeals to you, get it (preferably in some kind of sale), but wait with playing until the bugs are ironed out. It looks like the game will get a major update soon, considering that Steam has made it clear that achievements will be added.",

But then they have been going out and trying to force developers with complete success so far, to change the names of their games if it contains the word Wasteland.  You know its funny, because thats exactly something a publisher would do, they would throw money away pursuing these things instead of making games like Brian Fargo claimed thats what he wanted to do. Its understandable to engage in these legal matters when a game is intentionally trying to ape your stuff, but in every case the only similarity between titles, was the word Wasteland.  Have the courage to stand for something InXile, no one is going to try and USURP the Wasteland IP by making ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little indie games. I won't be sending you anymore of my money(unless you get the Fallout IP back and make Fallout games). So yeah, Never again.   Original, still true review below:  I have about 110 combined hours between Wasteland 2 Classic and the Director's Cut.  I backed this game on kickstarter and was pleased with Wasteland 2, to get the Director's Cut after for free was a huge bonus for me.  The game itself plays like a squad-based Fallout 1 and 2, but in its own 1980s style post-nuclear setting. The RPG elements are solid but the game is combat focused which I am happy for. You get a number of useable skills to to do quests with, find hidden objects and loot. There is a ton of flavor text everywhere you go which help adds to the immersion and feeling of the game which I love. The music is a perfect ambient style soundtrack which hits all the right notes and there is an ambient soundtrack for areas aswell to help add to that immersion.  There are tons of things to do in the wasteland and plenty to shoot aswell. Lots of weapons to choose from and different types of armors to wear. You can find clothing to dress your rangers up if you want, or will need to find clothing if you get it burnt off in combat!  I think if you enjoy squad based turn based combat, you'll like this game. If you enjoy post-apocalypse settings, you'll enjoy this game. If you like to read and use your imagination, you'll like this game.  If you liked Fallout 1 and 2, you will like this game.

Wasteland 2 is a great game, but it is not as good as Fallout 2.   The game is a good squad-based RPG that reminds me heavily of those old Fallout games, though. And indeed, I love this game much the same. There is a variety of ways you can solve most of your problems, and because of that, this game has consumed what has to have been over 10 hours of my life already.   There are some problems I have with the game. And if this game were made by any other unknown indie developer, I would have rolled my eyes and moved on. But this game was made by Brian Fargo, with help from several other veterans of good old RPGs that we knew and love, so this makes me disappointed at a few design choices.  1. A few skills are a bit too divided. Unnecessarily so. Why is Safecracking and Lockpicking two different skills? Why not just make Safes harder to lockpick? Why are Blunt Weapons and Bladed weapons separate? What was so wrong with a general 'melee' skill? Why is there a skill just for modding weapons? Who in their right mind would put skill points into Toaster Repair? While some skill divisions made logical sense -- obviously, in a squad-based RPG, a generic 'guns' skill would be broken, and speech is basically divided into what you want to accomplish with words (Reasoning, Seduction, or Intimidation). But I honestly think Weapon Modding should have been covered by Mechanical Repair, and Safes should fall under Lockpicking.  1a. And while I am at it, what is the point of the Demolitions skill outside of trap disarming? All explosive weapons are disposable, one-use items (REAAAAALLY dislike, by the way), and none of them are affected by your skill at handling explosives. Instead, grenades and bombs are handled XCOM: Enemy Unknown style -- click where you want the bomb to go and the character tosses it, with little chance of error. Now, I loved XCOM, but what the hell? No grenade launchers with appropriate ammo? No rockets for your LAWs and RPGs? No mines? (well, the ENEMY can place mines, but you can't). No C-4? Why have Demolitions at all, outside of defusing the numerous (frankly obnoxious) traps inside every other box of loot?  2. No Stealth mechanic or skill. This hit me pretty hard when I realized there was no stealth in the game, because I am all about conflict avoidance in RPGs. I am the kind of guy whose priority in Fallout New Vegas was getting my speech to 100 -- the fewer bullets I fire during a quest, the better. Not to mention there were several situations I ran into that practically BEGGED for the usage of stealth, and yet, it simply wasn't possible.   Aside from that though, the game seems to be doing well in the 'cause and effect' aspect that many RPGs sorely lack. There are tough decisions you will find yourself making as you journey across the wasteland. The best solutions that benefit everyone often require large amounts of skill in the required talents -- Unless you specialize your rangers, you aren't going to do many great things. It's a good RPG. And honestly, it has me hooked. But damnit, I DID expect better.  I do recommend it though, despite its flaws. The game itself is good, it's just that I did not expect to find the flaws I did from veterans of the industry. If you liked Wasteland, and you liked Fallout 1 and 2, check it out. Of course, I must stress this -- it is NOT Fallout. Don't get the game expecting Fallout.",

            "review_text": "I would recommend playing fallout 1 or 2 instead of this game, it starts with your character talking to a ranger, no explanation about who you are or why you're here, he just tells you about the death of another ranger and assumes you're in on the loop, you're dropped straight into the story with no idea who your character is or how they got there.   So you and your team of 3 (which you just met without introduction) leave the ranger camp to investigate a ranger's death for you're boss you just met, and for a moment I expected to embark on a grand adventure but dissapointingly the ranger died just a short walk away (along the way you'll have to fight the same 3 or 4 raiders over and over again) The team you lead doesn't say anything to eachother, apparently no one cares who they are or why they're here they never react verbally or non verbally to anything they're seeing or doing.   In fact every NPC feels as lifeless as their voice acting, which frankly is dull and boring, understandable had they been reading perhaps the 400th line of dialog at 5pm on a Friday, but it seems they carry the same enthusiasm or lack there of throughout the entire game or at least the first few hours that I've played.  After a few hours I began to grow impatient and decided I was going to do my own thing because I honestly don't care about the rangers, or their quests. I thought maybe I can start a fresh in another part of the wasteland, but you can't go walking too far into the desert, oh no, don't go exploring and trying to have fun because then you'll die of dehydration, you need to stay around the oasis' which are conveniently located along the routes to places you need to go, mother nature you sly dog.   It's disapointing that there's nothing to do around these oasis' except fight the same raiders over and over which for some may be fun for a minute or two, but you'll soon run out of ammunition and you're party is very fragile often bleeding from a single gunshot until death. Not a problem if you have plently of supplies dropped by the raiders you've killed for no reason, but wait a minute, I can't use it because I didn't go through med school, I needed to spec my character in a particular way otherwise I'm not able to heal.   That's alright I'll just go back to the ranger base and get them to heal me up, seeing as I am helping them out by investigating the death of their friend. Nope, they'll let me buy more of the supplies I've already got with the very little money I already have. But it seems they aren't prepared to give me treatment or anything else accept for the odd 'hurry up and do your job' radio message, If only I could somehow communicate to him that our group is very close to dead and would likely not survive another raider ambush.   It's puzzling how these characters survived for the 20 odd years prior to the beginning of this game without any decent weapons or currency? Don't think about that you gotta keep focused on the story, about a ranger that was killed by a giant frog when he went for a walk? The only appeal a game like this has for me personally is story and I am trying really hard to find some story here, it's just not happening.",

            "review_text": "I found the game to have serious game design flaws that make me regret the purchase. May this be a warning to others.  First there is way to much useless clicking involved. Seemingly every action requires another useless click. For example: characters don't just level up, one needs to call in to HQ then pretend to read the useless exchange with the caption then click through a series of boring dialog options only then can one go to assking skill points. Seriously I was annoyed by this even the first time around. You have to do this each time a character levels up ...  Here is another: assigning an item to a hotkey is not just dragging the item into the hotkey slot, you have to right click the item (even though the help says right-click to use, you have to disregard that) then click the assign hot key then click the hotkey. The interfaces are a little sluggish so you won't be clicking all that fast either.  Maps: The maps are tiny, cramped and sluggish. One seemingly needs to always rotate the map back and forth not to miss a detail. There is always another zone to load there is no sense of exploration or adventure. All the background are prerendered and non mostly non destructible. It is very difficult to figure out quest objectives - some objects are 'indestructible' until some quest objective is finished but still show up as targetable - so you end up wasting ammo on them.   Combat: The game interface is unforgiving in combat - it is hard to tell which character is in LOS of another thus in danger to get into a friendly fire incident. Combat alway seems to play out the same way, the enemy bum rushes you - and because the AI is dumb it has beefed up stats to make up for that. See that big rabbit that you shot four times already - it still has an insane range and attack power and still has the ability to quickly take down a trained well armed ranger. It is just bad game desing.  Travel: The map travel is boring and uninspired, who wants to watch an icon moving on a map - there is this seeminly pointless difficulty setting of having toxic fumes appear out of nowhere thus killing your entire party. WTF game design is that?  I really tried to like this game but unfortunately it lacks the simplicity and fun factor of old school tactical games such as XCOM or Jagged Alliance.",

            "review_text": "In short, Wasteland 2 tells a story about what you cannot do - open doors, chests or safes, hit enemies or talk cunningly. Mostly at the beginning of the game to be fair, but even later on there are several objects to interact with that often cause you to fail critically when using a maxed out skill on them. You then either have to accept this and carry on or load a previous save game and try again.  Given the fact that the loot often is not worth the trouble, option 1 should be the way to go (or ignore the possible loot in the fist place), but that's not what I expect of a game. Reloading (and again and again sometimes) is a slow and tedious process. May be I'm not getting the point and Wasteland 2 then is not the game for me, but on the other hand this is a personal review and all about how I like it.  There's more boring stuff in it, like quests which have you to visit the same places a few times over without the possibility to quick travel. Given the size and layout of some areas and the way they are connected to other areas sometimes causes you to sit there for minutes and tell your team to go back and forth. That's a way of extending the play time. One I don't like at all. Especially if the quest giver sends you more often than needed to the same place when all that has to be done could have easily been accomplished on the first visit.  Personally I didn't care much for the story. Cannot really identify the cause though. I found myself mostly rushing through the dialog options, only scanning for relevant key words to get through quickly - which is a shame because I think the writing itself seems to be fine. But I couldn't connect the the world like I did when playing Fallout 1 and 2 for example. In the end I tried to solve all open quests and finish the story so I could mark this game as completed.  Technically I had severe performance issues in some (mostly indoor) areas on my Linux machine and encountered several bugs. The Linux version of Borderlands 2 for example runs much better here.  I'm not saying Wasteland 2 is a bad game. Most people seem to like it. But you have to tolerate a couple of things which just annoy me to the point the fun gets significantly spoiled. All in all I'm too disappointed to recommend this game.",

I'd say it is a must to anyone who is into tactical games, the story and characters are very witty, there is plenty of variety in both items and personality, I was especially suprised when I found Mad Max's V8 inteceptor, being an aussie it blew me away, had to call the Mrs to come and have a look.

I also have trouble seeing past the walls of text - in the end, I just didn't care.

The skill system became trivial towards the end of the game, where there were more than enough points to go around.  Difficulty curve? The 'difficult' part of the game is scaled by opponent health, which, after carrying around launchers for most of the game, quickly disappeared. I think the 'hardest' part of the game was working out which option to choose, which in itself is another attempt at 'grey' decisions.   Spoilers ahead;  I saved the AG centre.

About the game, Wasteland 2 is not for everyone. Not by a long shot. It requires patience, thinking and in some cases, nerves of steel. The top-down view and turn-based combat may turn some people off. It's a hardcore RPG where your choices, starting from the very beginning at character creation, have lasting consequences throughout the game. If you're looking for an experience similar to the more recent Fallout games, you won't find it here.  The character creation is intimidating at first, especially for newcomers to these types of games. There are tons of skills and you have no way to know in advance which are useful and which are more situational. I suggest consulting a character creation guide, but if you want to do everything on your own, one tip: make a team of specialists. After character creation, it's good to keep in mind these three things: Talk to EVERYONE, LOOT everything that isn't bolted down (or if it is, Brute Force can help with that ;)) and do EVERYTHING you can before moving to the next area. If you miss something, it might mean missing out on quests, companions or loot.  The combat is tactical and turn-based. Director's Cut added precision strikes, which are not too useful at the beginning but can be lifesavers late in the game. It also brough some flavor to the combat system, which can be somewhat tedious at times. I found most of the quirks to be quite useless; their downsides were either too bad or they were too situational. Same goes for perks, they were a nice addition, but when selecting perks I had difficulty finding ones that were actually useful. Overall, precision strikes, quirks and perks feel somewhat like an aftertought; they're there and they're nice to have every once in a while, but they aren't really crucial to completing the game.  The weapon rebalancing of DC was a welcome addition. Assault rifles and Snipers are still king, but Shotguns, for example, now actually have some use. SMG's and Handguns still suck, though.  Overall, I definitely recommend this game to everyone. While it can be somewhat tedious and difficult at times, it's still a whole lot of fun.

The guy who tried to land the Desert Rangers in trouble with them is scared for his life because I dobbed him in as the true culprit - even after he helped me put things right, even after I said I wouldn't. He runs off to get his scaly mates all wound up and ready to make trouble.  I think about it for a split second then headshot the stupid bugger. He can have his little hissyfit, but there's no way he's stuffing up this unexpected and welcome truce, Not while my sniper's rifle is loaded.  Then I realise the effect this game is having on me. I'm horrified with myself. I rationalise the decision: the guy was too dumb to live; he'd have only got more innocent people killed; he was trying to covertly start fights he couldn't finish; at least if I put him down like this the other mob wouldn't torture him to death or something. I'm even more horrified at the rationalisations. I wonder if the game even has an event path for what I just did. Would his friends jump me next time because of a bug, or did he need to actually make it back to his friends to trigger that situation? Would there still be a truce when I got back? Did I really take care of the problem?   The problem. Huh. That problem had a name. And friends. Possibly a family.  This game is getting me to play like an amoral hardcase for the first time ever (usually I do my best to be a good guy) - and I simultaneously love it and fear it for that. Not because it's fun but because everything is a moral grey area, every success has a bit of failure in it, and it's rare for everyone to make it out alive and unscathed.  10/10",

I have no interest in the story line and the quests themselves are too dam long and boring.

On the other hand, if you enjoy isometric party-based RPGs but also might like to see some progress from the last 15 years or so of gaming history, Wasteland 2 is kind of a letdown precisely because of how stubbornly it emulates the UI fiddliness of Fallout 1/2. Get ready to remember which party member owns a shovel, switch to them, activate the shovel item, and wait while a progress bar fills up, every time you want to dig something up. And this isn't just shovels, it's *every specialized skill*. You're not realistically going to put together a party with more than one girl or guy who knows Safecracking or some other random ♥♥♥♥, but the game will never let you just click on the safe and have the one Safecracker open it.  The maps suffer from a similar level of fiddliness. You will have to memorize where in town that random questgiver is, or come back from a fetch quest to wander all over wondering where his shop is among a town of identical-looking dwellings. No quest markers is fine, I don't think that the player should have telepathic knowledge of where stuff is ahead of time, but when you're looking to turn in quests (and the characters would already know where shopkeeper X is) it's just a hassle. Isometric design also means that the level designers hide crates in places where you need to rotate the camera to find them ... which is fine, but after a while, it's not clever, it's just irritating to have to rotate the camera every time you enter a new room or potentially miss out on loot.  I could go on with examples of the weird sort of micromanagement that Wasteland 2 requires of the player (there are many more), but you get the point.  Bottom line, it feels like a game that came out in 2000, not 2014. If you're fine with this, go ahead and get it (but you probably already did). If you're not, and especially if you haven't played Fallout 1/2 to death, there's really no reason to play this instead of Fallout 1/2.",

But when I heard that Brian Fargo, who is responsible for the best games in the world (Fallout 1 and Fallout 2), wants to make a Wasteland 2 I was immediately interested. I bought Wasteland 2 but it waited a long time before I found the time to play and in the meantime a Director's Cut edition was published, which I received for free.  This game is not Fallout. But it is an awesome game nonetheless. It combines the RPG with tactics game (with more tactics element that RPG) but in a better way that Fallout Tactics did it. The game is hard. The combat is challenging and you always have less point in the skill that you need to use right now.  The plot is good with some nice plot twist at the end of the game. I was surprised as it all turned out. I enjoyed the grim future of the post-nuclear wasteland. People are struggling to maintain a decent life and you cannot help everybody. Sometimes you must choose who will live and who dies. And there are a lot of mad inhabitants (just as in Mad Max series and Fallout series you could tell that something in the radiations affects the brain cells). As I love a post-nuclear setting this was one of the best example of this unfriendly world.  The graphic could be better but for me it is not a major issue in a game like this. But it is done in a way to emphasis the dark world you are playing and that was done great. Personally I think that there could be more portraits. The sounds and voice acting are satisfying. Adrian Gordon wins the award for the best performance, he was outstanding. Just listen to his 'RAIN JERKS?!'. And last but not least the music. For me it was excellent. It caught the climate of the game perfectly. And I recommend to listen to the 'Cries of a Dead World' by Miracle of Sound (it is in the credits).  It is not the best game in the world but I rate it 9/10. Play it. Play it now!",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Decent story, interesting world, mediocre dialogues. Relatively boring battles/gameplay. Decent sound and graphics, but limited customization and very ugly character models. Would have fared better without the high expectations from the kickstarter. Close to a positive recommendation, but not quite: 5/10.  The sequel to the inspiration for Fallout... talk about high expectations. Add to this the fact that it was a super-successful Kickstarter project that promised to put the creative people back in charge of their own projects, and it's easy to see why so many hopes for the future of PC roleplaying rest(ed) on this game. I found it somewhat disappointing in many details small and large, unfortunately. Would I have liked it without the hype? I will never know. Does it matter for this review? No. A game that carries so much baggage needs to be reviewed with it in mind.   Story/World:  Meh. As so often, it is difficult to say anything without too many spoilers. The world is an... interesting place. Unlike Fallout, it places less emphasis on realism and does not take itself too seriously, allowing for some weird and fascinating factions and places, which are fun to explore. Unfortunately, while there are some gems, the size of the world means that no place has much depth and really catches your heart. Did I feel at home and connected to Ranger Citadel? No. Did I care that a lot of old acquaintances showed up, helped and died in the final battle? No. Did I really care for the epilogues for the places I had visited? No. So: While the game presents a varied and interesting world, it failed to pull me in.  Additionally, they sat a bit heavily on the predecessor (old characters, old locations, old stories that are repeated again and again) which I did not play, making it hard for me to get invested.  Dialogues were a mixed bag as well. Some good, but also a lot of repetition of the same pieces of information over and over again.  The roleplaying came down to a handful of choices (Do I help this person? Which of those two factions do I support?). My characters lacked, unfortunately, a character.  The main story is actually very short. Weird robots show up. Now go and fight them. It's nice and consistent, without plot holes, but the ending    not only digs out the Big Bad from part one, but also uses the Terminator reasoning for the nuclear war, which seems lazy.     Sound:  Nice enough, but could have been more varied.  Graphics:  I usually don't care too much about graphics, but some things really disturbed me here from the very beginning. Character models are  ugly . What's more, there are a very limited number of character portraits, all of which are used as NPC portraits as well, so you quite often have two identically-looking people talking to each other. Finally, the descriptions of characters in the world very often don't match their portrait at all. Takes me out of the story.  That said, the maps are done with great care and are quite beautiful.  Gameplay:  Yeah... that was what almost made me give up on the game in between. There are a few minor things that bugged me (area map is a screenshot, allows no notes, shows no locations), but the big thing is the combat. This is where you spend most of your game.  But  the combat is pretty damn  boring : There is a basic cover mechanic, but many places in which you will find yourself starting battles are devoid of cover at least for your group. Thus, many battles end up being about choosing who to shoot. Throw in some small-ish things like unclear sight lines/weapon ranges especially when the battle goes over two levels and the whole affair becomes less an intricate chess game between you and the (mediocre) AI and more a tedious excercise in mopping up without using too many resources.  Then there are the crates. And the safes. And the holes. And the toasters. Everything wants to give you items, which are absolutely necessary in the beginning and absolutely superfluous in the end. But if you're anything like me, you will STILL open the next safe - just in case of the very occasional plot-relevant item. Makes the game go even slower and becomes, at times, an excercise in quick-saving and quick-loading.  Finally, while the game throws loads of skills at you, there is no deep character building here. One weapon skill, one auxiliary skill (or three for the skill monkeys) per person, done.  In summary, while the game amused me and made me smile at times, it did not make me think and it did not make me care for its world or characters. At least one of those I expect from a roleplaying game. Thus: Not recommended.  Addendum: Reading it again, this review sounds exceptionally negative. It wasn't really meant to be; most of the issues I mentioned bothered me, but not as much as in other games. It's just that a lot of things that don't bother me too much add up to make this game pretty mediocre - maybe 5/10.",

            "review_text": "Wasteland 2 was one of those games that really speaks to older generations of games. There are many good as well as bad design features, but overall it's an enjoyable experience if you're willing to put yourself through it.   Upon starting up your first game you create a party of four Rangers and can choose their stats and skills, select character appearance options, and write a quick bio should you so desire. Of course, one of the things that is limited by the standards of old crpgs is that you can't play your character too far off the path of the desert rangers, but still the story is interesting and features a lot of unique ideas that might just get you to crack a smile.   Now there is a ton of dialogue and text in this game, but of course that means a lot of conversation options come up time after time. You'll find your self clicking things to get them out of the way, and of course sometimes this can get you into confrontations without any clear indications. Since I like to schmooze my way through many of these it was kind of annoying that there werent more options to use the skills associated with conversation, but at least they were there.   The combat mechanics were probably the most fun. I played this game at the second highest difficulty on my first try and didn't have too much trouble. There are some frustrating things, like enemies walking 150 tiles across the map straight up to your characters on the first turn and punching them in the face, but so long as you're prepared you can usually deal with this by lobbing out grenades and rockets. That being said, there are plenty of different weapons to take advantage of and they are all useful and unique in different ways. Some character stats are more useful to combat than others, so it helps a ton to diversify your party because the situations that arise require different skills and weapons. Some enemies are tough to take out with light weapons, but easy targets with energy guns, and vice versa.   As a piece of advice you will be binding quick save to the key closest to your keyboard hand, and pressing it often. There are times where it is not always clear what you have to do, and if you do them in the wrong order you can get into situations like endless combat for HOURS before you give up and reload. It's truly unfortunate that unorthodox situations do this to the player, as it feels restricting at times. I remember early in the game trying to expedite a mayoral race, and did as many helpful tasks as I could save for one that I could not find. Turns out the doctor, who said he didn't need any help, actually needec you to use your surgeon skill on his patients... seriously? I spent hours trying to figure this out before looking it up.   Another gripe is that you will spend hours just walking across maps, for no purpouse other than you're going back and fourth for quests. There are sometimes ways around this that open up after having done enough to open up a quicker passage, but usually by this point it doesn't even matter anymore. You'll experience this enough to come to hate the experience. You'll be getting out your chair to find something to distract you for three minutes while your party walks around, and sometimes you have no idea if where you're going is going to help your quest. Truly this was the most frustrating aspect of the game.   Yet another thing, many characters have the same portraits, even important ones at times. I really wish that they had taken the Baldurs Gate appreach and only gave important characters unique portraits. And the portraits, they look like they were painted by a college student. They werent bad, but felt lacking. Sometimes it made the characters you meet less unique, as they just sort of blend into each other.   Now it might seem i'm going off on the negative aspects of the game, but these are things you should know before you start playing. It's by no means perfect, but hightly enjoyable. Comparable to Shadowrun Returns, where as shadowrun had a really focused story and an enjoyable simplicity, Wasteland 2 has a very big and diluted feel with explosive chests falling out of the sky and arguably more interesting combat mechanics and a big world.",

Whenever you aren't in an encounter area (random encounter, dungeon, town), your party is represented as a marker on a huge map of the American Southwest, which will slowly move toward your destination in the way Indiana Jones travels-- a line drawn on the map.

There are an incredible number of skills that could fall under various traditional RPG roles (tank, rogue, healer, etc), and even within one of those major categories there's plenty of room for variation. I find this a fun aspect of the game, because the four characters (which I created completely from scratch, from their appearance to their skills to their religion and the brand of cigarettes they smoke) can be completely different from each other and are able to support each other well in combat, trading, persuading, and other tasks in which they find themselves.  I will definitely work my way through the entire storyline in this game at least once, and it's entirely likely that I'll go through several more times because, with this wide variety of character traits to choose from, I don't see myself playing the game the same way twice.",

(played native res of 2560x1440) - Not open ended completeing the storyline missions ends the game.  I cant seem to figure out what is up with the ending. After winning the finnal battle General Vargus says to detonate the nuke. There is not nuke in the basment of the Citadel and the elevator does not work to return to the upper level. I tried reloading the game and it doesn't even reload to the area my characters are, it reloads outside the citadel. Really strange. I wonder if the latest patch (patch 5) just downloaded a couple days ago broke something?  Obviously there are still some issues wtih this game and it does need some polishing/tunning/balencing done it. It really is a great game that I have had many fun hours playing. I do plan on playing through once more and I will be implimenting some mods I have downloaded from the nexus in an effort to do some tunning myself. I really hope InExile is able to fix the broken ending so you can actually set off the nuke and 'save the world' through your self-destruction. Whatever...

Like Tactics, you start off with four party members and are given the task of investigating the mystery of the death of one of your fellow Rangers, Ace. (Before you leave the Citadel, you should pick up Ace's friend Angela Deth as a follower.) But beforehand, you get to create your team, Team Echo, with a very sophisticated character creation interface in which you decide what each of your Rangers will be good at. (i.e. Submachine Guns, Field Medic, Toaster Repair, Brawling, Surgeon, etc.) and then design their characters with a...very dull appearance. You'll get to name them, decide their age, if they do drugs, if they have a religion, and write a character bio. If you don't want to go through all that jazz, you can pick from their pool of pre-made characters. Once you're done with that, you're ready to start your career as a Desert Ranger!

The Game is amazing the Character creation can take an hour or more trying to fit all the skills your want in to 4 characters you quickly learn you cant have what you want, time to pick what you think you'll need.   While I see alot of comparing it to Fallout 1&amp;2 no one mentions how close the game is to Fallout tactics the combat is almost a clone. Fallout tactics was also a squad based game with the same Map system for travel.  All in all I love the game, Best $40 I have spent this year the replay value is high and it makes me feel like I was a teen again, Playing Fallout on a computer that could barely run doom.   ( Edit ) Having Completed the game I feel I should fill out the reveiw Some more. First The Battle system does get a little bit boring shall I say? but its to be expected in a battle System of Turn Based and Guns in the end you know what is going to happen you'll hit that wall for every shot hits. The AI does tend to simply Rush at you rather than use cover but again to be expected from this type of game ( Fallouts where all the same ) But the story and the choices you make unlike normal RPG they carry a certain weight too them which after the first one or two you make and you realise this you start to question your actions, what to say to the NPC's what the out come might be and how to push it the way you want.   All in All I loved the game it felt Fleshed out and complete to me, I did not see any of the bugs the others have added to their reviews infact the only issue I did was that the Camera locked at one point and I had to Alt + Tab to fix it. I will Play again, many times. I feel that if you want a game where choices do matter and who you Shoot changes the game this is the game for you. I look forward to some DLC too.   10/10",

Combat: One of the biggest downs is the non avaible sneak mode. Once your spotted (and you will be at a very long range usually) every enemy near the one who spot you will enter combat. That part is okay i guess, because if you get spotted by an enemy human guard IRL i guess he would scream for help and the other would still be coming because of the gunfire.  But usually there is huge open areas which are impossible to sneak through without taking a totally different way which anyhow leads up to a combat situation just from an other entry point.  So forget about playing sneaky because there are no stealthboys in this game.   And also the hit ratio seems messed up (or im just really unlucky).  Questing:  I have really enjoyed the quest, its no pointing fingers in this game. You just get a general tip of the whereabout of whatever you'r searching for. It's no arrow pointing you exactly to the location to go. Which is really nice.   If you do the 'right' thing in a questline its a huge chance you end up with better supplies and another follower to your party (which is always nice because combat is unforgiving, if you play on normal or ranger difficulty).  Lots of random loot you find will be of interest to various NPC's throughout the world (not the junk items, altho it says in tooltip that you never know who might be interested in a junk item. Still haven't found any use of em)  World:  Like many others said before me, its too much space with not enough content. And too many preset combat situations when walking on the map from zone to zone.   Bugs: With the most recent patch i havent encountered many. Just one where monk suiciders go through stairs and walls.  Overall: 6/10 Lots of fun but without enough depth to satisfy you'r RPG experience. Too much sloppy work on character development (like there are only a few of your party members on whom you can customize pants, jacket and hat) Many of them got just preset apperance.  ",

However, at one point I've realized this game has fundamental flaw, what will prevent me from completing it - and that exactly what just happened. I'm in the middle of LA region, and significant part of plot is ahead of me, but I just can't stand it no more. I know, for any quest left, for any encounter there will be 100 useless actions I'll be required to perform.  Wasteland 2 is a good example why nobody should try to implement gameplay from 1990-x now. From 37 hours I've spent in this game I feel like about 30 were about opening boxes, crates and other various containers, disarming alarms and cracking safes. Not only that, this game is full of character skills for every occasion. Healer and surgeon. Heavy weapon and automatic weapon. Kiss a-s-s and smart a-s-s, and some other a-s-s - all related to one thing - dialogs. There is even special skill for toaster repair (not related to regular repair, of course). But having too many skills is just part of the problem. Another, biggest issue, most of this skills take real time to perform. It's 15 seconds or so to open a lock. 15 seconds of staring into the screen, it's not interactive. It's not much, but consider 5-10 safes per location - it's 2-3 minutes at best, more if you fail. Rinse and repeat it on the next encounter. You also might be really lucky to have 10 landmines begging to be disarmed - another 2-3 minutes of your priceless lifetime. Add alarms, healing, and whatnot - I'm surpised reloading weapons does not requires time! - and here you go.   I clearly don't have The Skill to master all these skills.

This may well be the first game set on Earth that actually lets you choose both your nationality and religion. Dunno if that actually DOES anything, but its neat.  - Crafting, modding, and so on is ready from the word go (provided one of your guys is a weaponsmith) and you can immediately use any mods you get.  Cons: - The combat is horribly stacked against you even on the lowest difficutly. Here's a quick rundown of the issues I had with it:  - I want it to be a rule in games like this that if you have ranged combat, whether its guns or bows or whatever, that your BASIC ammo is unlimited. Especially, and I mean ESPECIALLY, when one of the first areas you go to has zombies that explode upon death and plants that burst the second you get near them. The only way to get past those without getting hurt was to shoot them, which eats up ammo very quickly.  - Some of the fights are so stacked against you it's painful. I get that people want a good fight, but when my four guys are up against four raiders with assault rifles, two throwing dynamite, two more with pistols, and one big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a machine gun in the same fight I might begin to think that this game's difficulty needs to be adjusted a bit. Yes it does come with difficulty settings but here's the thing: I WAS PLAYING ON ROOKIE WHEN THIS HAPPENED! I'm not asking for a free ride here, but for ♥♥♥♥'s sake I did that fight three times and each time my entire team got wiped out within a few rounds because our half of the battlefield is narrow and, again, TWO GUYS THROW BOMBS AT US!  - It seems like my guys miss a hell of a lot. My team had one guy who specialized in energy weapons, one who was good with pistols, another who used shotguns, and a melee specialist. No matter what though, even with crouching, I could sometimes only get about 50% hit chance even at point blank range and this was with them having most of their points in that weapon type.  - Status effects for everyone! This involves combat too, but also those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t plants I mentioned and others. It is way too easy for the enemy to stack up damage over time effects on you. Poisons, bleeding, and other debuffs cause severe difficulty in and out of combat, especially when my healer girl would run out of medkits to keep my crew alive. Yes I get that if you got shot several times its very realistic for you to bleed... but in a game where I fight pod people, giant mutant rabbits, and maggots the size of dogs realism can kiss my big fat ♥♥♥.   Overall: Fans of classic 'crush your balls' difficult CRPGs like the original Fallout will enjoy it, but in the end I found it too frustrating to keep going. By all means have some difficult fights, but when every fight is one that can kill the hell out of your team and I wind up resorting to save scumming just to get past them it doesn't exactly make me feel like the heroic lawman of the wastelands. Go the fantasy route and give Pillars of Eternity or Divinity: Original Sin a try instead.",

            "review_text": "3/5  I've been playing Wasteland 2 and feeling a little disappointed. It's too retro.  The pacing is on the slow side, and it's not the best-looking game.  OK, it's set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but character designs and backgrounds can still look good. Like, the environments of Bethesda's Fallout 3 were dramatic and beautiful even if they were all drab gray ruins. My performance should not be this poor for a game that looks like this.  And the skill use is just a touch too slow. If one needs to save-load-spam to get past a lock, or if there are a lot of mines to disarm, it's tedious.  And the combat does not feel as dynamic and tactical as, say, the X-Com remake's. There's really only 2 options: headshot and burst, otherwise one crouches the team and shoots and that's it for tactics. X-Com's system encouraged much more movement and flanking, as well as having special abilities by class that affect tactics. And of course, Divinity: Original Sin introduces a lot of tricks with spell interactions that can control the battlefield, or that rapidly move characters around the battlefield. Compared to X-Com and D:OS, the combat in W2 feels primitive.   Also, it REALLY needs formation options. It's damn tedious having to individually click on the characters to spread them out before triggering combat. Most of the time I just have them clustered up non-optimally because I can get away with it, but it would have been nice if there were Baldur's Gate style formations. If there is an option for this and I'm just too slack to find it in the interface, please, tell me.  If I hadn't played Divinity: Original Sin or X-Com, I would probably really enjoy Wasteland 2. It's still a decent game, but it feels like D:OS just does it better. It's prettier, the combat is more fun, the pacing is better....  Wasteland 2 feels like there was a little too much old-school thinking limiting their design decisions.  And some of the mechanics just plain feel WEIRD. Like how disconnected attributes are from skill use. Or the way energy weapons work with armor. There should NEVER be a situation where it's better to have lower armor, that's just dumb.  Plus there are too many skills that cover similar things like lockpick + safecracaking, 3 skills all covering dialogue, etc. Do shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, smgs really all need separate skills? It ought to just be small arms, long arms, energy weapons and heavy. It seems COMPLETELY random that toaster repair requires its own skill.   Normally, I'd still recommend this game as it's still above average, but there are SO many great games out or soon to be out; I would hold this purchase until it's on sale.  I'm frankly astonished at how many people seem to love it. I mean, it's okay, and I'm still going to finish it, but they write like they love it. Did they not also play Divinity: Original Sin, an also crowdfunded game that is superior in nearly every way? I loved the old school rpgs too (the Fallout games, the Infinity Engine games, the gold box games), but a great deal of the good feelings around this game seem to be driven by nostalgia more than what it actually delivers.",

            "review_text": "Game is decent but seems like it was rushed. There are a lot of inconsistencies and annoying things left out that would have made the game much better.  The NPC pictures look weird and different than the game's text descriptions. You will read about how ancient looking an NPC looks and the picture will be of a person in their mid-to-late 30's. Stuff like that isn't too serious but it does break immersion a little.  The camera controls are annoying. You will constantly miss things and have to re-search areas because the camera angle was wrong and a wall or something was obstructing your view. I am not even talking about small things either... you could miss a giant door or anything because of this. You can press the Z button to see outlines of interact able things but if you want to make sure you find everything you pretty much would have to hold it down the entire time which is unacceptable. Small rooms are almost uninteractable because of this. I don't understand why the developers didn't make it that walls go transparent when you get near them (like most other games like this one). It seems like it would be a simple thing to do that would make the gameplay so much better. Perhaps a future update will address this?  One of my characters has had a concussion effect for pretty much the entire game. It tells me to go see a doctor but there are none to be found anywhere (or I keep missing them due to the way the overview camera works as explained earlier.) Therefore she is suffering from lost attribute points and I seemingly cant do anything about it. Annoying.  Your characters don't automatically level up. You have to go through an unnecessarily lengthy radio call-in dialog every time someone has enough experience to level up. Because your characters level up individually and at different times expect to do this frequently, almost after every battle encounter. While we are on the topic of leveling up the character skill and inventory screens are very clunky and unintuitive. An example of this is when you find a new weapon and want to compare it with a character's current weapon. Since you have a primary and secondary equip slot you can only compare it to the currently equipped weapon. To compare it to the weapon in the other slot you have to exit the inventory screen, switch to the other weapon slot, and re-enter the inventory screen. Like most things I have pointed out this is more annoying than really game-breaking.  Ammo is pretty scarce IMHO. You will go up against enemies that shower you with bullets but somehow only drop a few when they die. Buying bullets is expensive as well. Just a warning.  The worst problem with this game I have encountered so far is how enemies seem to have unlimited action points allowing them to move around at will every turn. I had one enemy make it from a field, up a ladder, and right next to my sniper sitting on a building in a single turn which doesn't seem right at all. It is really irritating to setup a nice ambush plan only to have your troops overwhelmed by melee enemies that make it 20-30 spaces in a single turn right next to your well-positioned team members. It really spoils the whole battle mode IMHO.  I was going to give this game a thumbs-up overall but after actually typing out all this stuff I have changed my mind. The decent story is overshadowed by a horde of minor annoyances and I have to give it a thumbs down until they address this stuff.",

THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!! Fallout 1&amp;2 and Fallout tactics and even with a mix of the Dragon age tactical combat (imo anyway) amazing game and SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY EASTER EGGS!!! lol combat is very strategic which i like skills are really cool and how different ones can interact with the world in different ways. surprisingly the story is very easy to follow and upon leaving the ranger citadel it wont be long before the games starts to swallow you, the open world map is actually very well done and the random encounters (which scale off of outdoorsmen) have a nice touch ranging between attacks and finding random caches or even merchants. the voice over is well done, i actually enjoy listening to different character conversations and sometimes you can even get VERY USEFUL info off of eavsdropping. character development is similar to that of fallout with the quirk and perk system (almost reminds more of Fallout new vegas even the setting will remind you of it) the game will give you so much nostalgia and comparisons moments like how the setting and certain tribes and coumminties come from different movie or game references with slight name changes the enemies you encounter, and the backstory to an antagonist early on will all give you this feeling, overall im impressed and i understand now why folks like this game. this aint no shoot up michael bay BS where EVERYTHING goes BOOM, nope, here we only pick a handful of select few rangers good or bad who can carry out any task for he good of the wasteland so sure make you guy a master mechanic or make a combat medic or even a sharpshooter! but remember your only success lies in teamwork, for no ranger is a real Ranger with out his crew!!! 10/10 cant wait for a 2nd playthru.",

The turn based combat offer many options but doesn't complicate things (think of XCOM:EU/EW, when it comes down to simplicity; not much micromanagement) so it keeps up the pace and therefore the fun! Combat can also be really hard on higher difficulties since there are some medical conditions you can get (e.g. concussion, blood loss, etc.) much more frequently than in Fallout 1 &amp;2 (it was very rare to get hurt in the eyes, legs or arms). While the combat and interface mechanics are simple there are a lot of options, skills and abilities, e.g. to spot a trap on a door you need to activate your skill 'perception' and it must be high enough. Spotting a trap is one thing but disarming is another thing that require the specific skill. In Fallout there were some skill with little or almost no use like Science but not so in Wasteland 2. Every skill you can learn can be used and some skills that seem irrelevant at first might even used in the first hour (like repairing toasters!).  Do you know the tactical RPG The Fall: Last Days of Gaia? If yes think about Wasteland 2 like a next gen and well crafted and balanced version of The Fall (and Fallout Tactics). Everything just works, quests which appear pretty straight forward and easy at first may open up and get more complicated or leads you further than you have expected (think about Vampire: Bloodlines or The Witcher 1) The German version has some troubles with the translation here and there (few parts are poorly translated or not at all) so this may apply to other languages then English, too.  The soundtrack does really make you think you're in Wasteland 1 or Fallout 1. It's just well fitting and while depressing it really makes you enjoy and recognize the soundtrack deliberately.  I wish there were more customization options for the character creation but you can use custom portraits like back in the old days of Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate. Since you probably use a camera angle with further distance it's not a big problem.  The price for this game retail is 30 bucks and for 40 you'll get the Ranger Edition in an amazing looking box with nice additional physical content (plus the Soundtrack from Wasteland 1 and 2). So you get more for your money than with many other triple A titles nowadays, physically and virtual.",

After the game was patched a few times it was much better. -The graphics could have been a bit better. I played and enjoyed the original Wasteland when I was 14 so I'm used to old school graphics, but idk, maybe I'm spoiled by all of the good graphics these days. The graphics are by no means bad. -They did not do enough bug testing in the last few zones of the game. Some quest do not work or get stuck.  I supported them as a backer and I have to say overall I was very happy with this game.    ",

Really the only thing I can think of that I don't like is that it is far too short for my liking, it lacks variety in the weapons, clothes and armor you can find and/or buy to dapper your characters up with and it could use a lot more side missions.  All that being said, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Fallout series or the original Wasteland. Can't wait for Wasteland 3.",

I guess I won't know until I can ungrade in the distant future.  Other things that bothered me a bit were during character creation. I couldn't see my character portrait very well but that may be because I don't have a real videocard. It's a minor issue, so I ignored it. What bothered me a bit more was that each character is assigned 12 skill points, yet all skills cost 2 points each. Erm...just divide everything by 2 and you get the actual number of skill points and costs. Why design it this way?  Also, I have no idea if it's just my anxiety problems, but running into characters that have serious attitude problems, and there were many, is kinda aggravating. Though, in this environment I can understand how real people would be on edge. But if I was also in this environment I'd personally not want to help so many crabby people. It brings out my inner crabbyness. And so did the first few hours of this game. lol?  Eh, I may still buy it when it's on sale again in the future.

Also i would like to have more clues for what to do during tasks and missions.  Since i am not a telepath, it is somewhat difficult to know what i am supposed to do, this makes it impossible to complete many tasks.

Looting of deads- Please explain to me why is it so when i have killed some enemies, i can only find junk on them? They clearly shoot at me with good/usuable weapons, but when i loot them, they have tennisballs and teddybears. And no guns, or broken gunparts. I am maybe mistaken here, but noone threw tennisballs at me or fluffy pink teddybears. So Where the ♥♥♥♥♥ are the weapons the attackers used? FIX THIS FRUSTRATING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DETAIL ASAP.  And why is it so all the safes and crates that are locked and protected by alarms, they only have junk inside? Atleast they should have ammo, weapon or sexy weapon parts.

Now, let's see the pros and cons:  Pros: - It's a decent RPG, with an ok story - Some nice characters - Funny dialogs now and then - Some interesting faction dynamics  Cons: - It's so long, combat is so not interesting, that I ended up cheating my way by maxing out all the attributes, all my skills, max money, etc... skipping all the random encouters, and it still took forever to finish the game - Many places where you have to search online to find the solution... because you did not see the interactable element that is 2 pixels on the screen or not highlighting because the camera position decided that it would not - Places where you have to do things in a specific non obvious way despite descriptions hinting that other ways would work  Ultimately I think it's a decent game, but it's probably not going to stay in players memories as Fallout was, it's just not that good.

That includes director's cut.  they are a great bunch of guys.   it should then, come as no surprise when their game, made to follow in the footsteps of the original wasteland, turns out to be a gem, in the process of being polished for yet a second time, with directors cut. having played the original like a fiend, i can tell you it feels alot like it. i'm not IN LOVE with the engine they used, per se, but it works. the detail they were able to get using it speaks for itself, in my opinion. things pop, the detail is there, without overstating itself or becoming the center of attention.  That, would be the combat.  combat in wasteland 1 was pretty standard zork crap. press a button here, press a button there, with only text for us to go by. i'm not complaining; but thats how it was. in all honesty it was pretty boring. now take wasteland 2. i've been playing video games for... well, just take a look at my steam account. 12 years on here. so i can tell you i've played quite a few games. wasteland 2 FEELS like it should, having gone thru the fire as Brian Fargo has. there is only so many things you can do with an isometric combat oriented tactical rpg.... NOOOOT. seriously, play around with the combat and tell me it doesn't feel EXACTLY like it did when you had a good g.i. joe match going with your best friend. i'll give you a million bucks if it doesn't.  for me alot of it is nestalgia, at least at first.  if you like top down tactical rpgs, and miss this kind of game, this will be your JAM.   i cannot stress to you how amazing this game is.  remember all those BAD kickstarter campaigns??  they're trying to mimic this one.  too bad they cant. brian fargo is old school tested, new school approved.

Let's put it this way, every bullet every move counts but the frustrating part is that the drop system, which has some serious balance issues (feels like the game uses a seed randomizer) which can leave you many many many time defenseless with a lot of inventory junk in a heavily infested world.. the game is really unforgiving..   However, the downside for me is the conversations part.. tons and tons of reading.. at the start i was into reading every single word, but as the game progressed I started losing interest especially when having a long conversation during a mission; this really sucks the action out of the game (at some points).. I would've prefered a more of a fallout 3 style of conversations..   ",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed the game, but not as much as I was hyped. Please note, I RECOMMEND this game at a lower price, but at full? God no.    I felt there wasn't much I haven't already done in other post apoclyptic games, or RPGs for that matter. The story was good all the way up until the end, where it fell flat and felt very rushed. The fact that the main antagonist was recycled once more from the previous iteration was neither suprising and also extremely eye rolling.   The freedom of 'choice' seemed very bare bones, making me feel that there was only a few ways to solve problems with each branch just ending up at the same point. It suffers from the 'amusement park' effect of most RPGs, (which needs to stop). Where, sure there are many interesting areas to see, but once you've more or less tied everything up at that area, there is no need to return to it, ever. There is no real sense of a vibrant enviroment around you, you just go from A to B to C to D, only really back and forth to replenish/sell/top up your water and some few quests. There wasn't much dungeon raiding or exploration, I may have missed a few - and if I did that's on me.   I thought all of Los Angeles was super rushed and pretty crummy, with exception of Rodia which was kinda when I got my second wind, only to be really kinda drained by the lack of really anything interesting going on. With each stop after rodia easily tied up and finished within a hour. The last two hours of the game dragged on with combat and really bad black and white choices.   As when I played it (I hope it gets patched for whomever is interested) a lot of the sidequests were really broken or dead ended if you did specific things in a different order. Which sucks if you have no idea - I would make sense if it was specific to something you dead, but sometimes it uses a character that isn't relevent anymore, but since you already did something related to another quest with them, their dialog wheel is a bust. (McDade im thinking of you as well as Maggie).   The combat was awful, straight awful for the first bit - however once I got so overpowered from overlevelling (due to so much travel and map combing for areas) you smash through confrontations, and after doing massive criticals did I really start getting excited to do battle. Once you hoard RPG/Rocket launchers, did it really get fun too. Only problem I have is the weapon jamming was pretty broken. I jammed so many times, I never had a real issue with missing, I would just CONSTANTLY jam, it only made fights more longer, I was never really in danger.   ----------  The only really things that was consistent and what I enjoyed, was the followers. They always had something relative to say, and for every quest/event etc. Scotchmo and the tryhard rebellious LA punk were my favourite. They all have little bios you can read. There are some good dialog trees but they are few and far between, I again felt that with all of the chest thumping and crazy black or white decisions you had to make, people kinda didn't do anything about it unless it was to -try- and kill you, face forward. Which is a dumb way to resolve anything.   I did enjoy the customization of my characters, and the idea of spreading out all of your wanted perks over 4 characters. I could roleplay 4 different people rather then being a jack of all trades. Which was a shame, because nobody really noticed or reacted specifically to any individual of my group specifically. It might've well of just been one person, shame.  Overall I'd rank it a 6.5/10. It started off strong but towards the end I was writing it off. I really love the post apocalyptic genre, and I could never get sick of it. The controls and interface were crisp and steady. Unity was a poor choice, but acceptable. I just hope they do not get discouraged or blame fans if they didn't enjoy their return. I hope there is turn based wasteland game to come.   Only buy on sale. Nice attempt, but it will be unlikely that I ever play through it again, unlike the Fallouts, Stalkers and other RPGs.  (On a plus side, this is a kickstarter game that WASN'T a complete write off, props to inXile).",

            "review_text": "Ok, so I'm 20 hours in (according to Steam), and I've owned the game for less than 2 days. Was Wasteland 2 worth it for me? I'd say so. I like complex, difficult games. Should YOU buy it? I'm not so sure. I'd give the game a 8/10 so far, but I can't recommend it to everyone. I'll breifly give you some points of reference to understand the game, and then I'll go over some more detailed points to explain why I feel the game rates an 8. Also, I did not judge the game on it's graphics. If that's what's important to you there's a massive line-up of AAA titles out there right now that will blow up your computer. W2 is not one of them. If you like XCOM Enemy Uknown/Within, then you should understand how combat works, yet the combat in W2 is much slower than in XCOM. This is, in large part, due to the depth of W2's combat system. I'll go over some of those points in a minute, but suffice to say that most of the important parts of combat are never explained, or poorly explained. The are intuitive, and they make sense, but the learning curve is far steeper than XCOM, for sure. As far as the story goes, well, the story of XCOM is told in your own head and in the moment to moment action (especially after you've played the game for hundreds of cumilitive hours), while in W2 the majority of the story is told in conversations. It's actually very similar to KOTOR or Fallout 3 in that the combat takes less than half of your playtime. Maybe even less. Unless you skip all the conversations in W2, which I imagine many players will. I fear, however, that the game loses much of its charm and drive if you don't pay attention to the written dialogue. I just think that most players aren't playing a video game to read massive amounts of text, even thought the writing is done rather well and I personally enjoy it. But then I enjoy reading and writing in my spare time, which is not representative of the average gamer. I imagine the replayability to be very high, however, since after 20 hours I'm already regretting my character builds and wishing I'd done things differently. But I'm still in the bottom quarter of the world map, and barely past level 10 with my main charaters. Even with up to seven people in your party you can't possibly have all the necessary skills for every given situation, which is both cool and frustrating. For example, your first companion, Deth, is a complete badass, and quite overpowered, and 20 hours in she is still in my party. She was essential at the beginning, yet she made one of my 4 custom charaters basically obselete. I diversified later, but unlike in XCOM, you can't switch out one of your 4 primary soldiers until one of them dies. I even purposely killed my melee warior because in the end I found him useless. Down the line you can flesh out your team somewhat using the 3 additional party slots, but it bums me out that their stories are more fleshed out than the 4 custom charaters I spent an hour making. The game truly does throw you in the deep end make you figure things out on your own. For example, does the Demolitions skill make you more proficient with exlosives? No. Apparently anyone can use explosives fairly well without training. What the demolitions skill allows you to do is disarm explosive traps. Not seeing the traps that keep on exploding in your face, even in the early game? Well, that's because you need to level up your perception skill. 'But I made sure my Awarenes skill is at Max!' you may say. Tough luck, you should have invested that in intelligence so you'd have more skill points after each level to upgrade your Perception skill. Which is a passive ability, byt the way, but you NEED TO TURN IT ON. According to Wasteland 2 and every dictionary ever Perception and Awareness mean very different things. But in the context of most video games some may think they are interchangable or at least related. In W2 they're not. This game doesn't hold your hand. This symbiosis or abilities does play out in fun and intersting ways, however. A simple example is when you break a safe while trying to crack it, you can repair it with the mechanical repair skill and try to crack it again. If you detect a boobytrapped door you can Percieve the mine, use the Demolition skill to disarm the explosive trap, then try to pick the lock, fail and set off an alarm, then use another skill to deactivate the alarm, while simultaneously smashing the broken door in with brute force. Moments like that are cool, though really only present in the more scripted story missions. Also, believe it or not, in the middle of combat you can see all the information you need about your currently equiped weapon just by hovering your mouse over certain areas to generate tooltips. It wasn't until 10 hours in that i finally found out that's where you find out your weapon's optimum range - float your mouse over the bar with mini arrows just aove the gun portrait. I could also have checked the weapon in my inventory, but who has the time for all that? Also, armor is poorly explained, so I'll explain it to you. Armor does not lessen damage taken in the traditional may like add HP or subtract from incoming damage. What it does is lessen the damage from weapons with lower armor penetration. A badass looking weapon may suck against everyone but the most basic of enemies if it has low armor penetration. That expensive new assault rifle doesn't look like much of an upgrade? Guess again, if it penetrates even ONE MORE armor layer. Seriously. I'll give you a hypothetical example. Lets say you have 2 characters weilding hypothetical pistols that both do 20-25 base damage. One of the pistols has 1 armor penetration while the other has 5. Now let's say a wolf with 1 armor ran at your two characters, and both your charaters shoots it. Both guns would do 20-30 damage. Now a human comes along, but he has 3 armor. This time the two guns do 5-8 and 20-30 damage. Huge difference, right? Now if you send that team against an enemy with 5 armor one of your soldiers will still be doing a solid 20-30 damage, but the second will be doing 1 damage every time. I barely won a few tough fights because I didn't grasp this for a long while. Honestly, I feel like I can write a guide about this game, and I'm sure there are guides out there. Yet I'd say that less than half of the people who may have tried to read this review have reached this far. In my opinion those poeple shouldn't buy the game. If you didn't have the patience to read this review, then the odds are you will not have the patience for the game. If you have completed this review, and I haven't turned you off from playing it, then follow my lead and buy it. It's pretty good. I like XCOM better, but in some ways the two games are like apples and oranges. Good thing I like both.",

I remember walking by a small village made of junk and rust, treading heavily in my power armor. Children were playing around, and the wasteland sun was shining. One kid threw a stone at me, it clancked off my shoulder plate. I decided to play along, picked that stone up and threw back at the kid, my hand accelerated with well-oiled X-series power armor motors. The stone went right through kid's body, he screamed and fell into a puddle of his own blood and entrails. Suddenly i became an all-hated child murdering psycho, but what did i care, i had a Bozar on my back, helload of ammo and iguana on a stick. Terrified villagers heard my helmet-muffled whistling as i walked away, towards the white wasteland sun and new exciting adventures.   That's one of my many Fallout memories, and the only memory that Wasteland 2 left is gosh that sucked.   Wasteland 2 is on a level of really good tablet or smartphone game. It's built on awful Unity engine, which screams lazyness, it has a tablet-level dumb combat system, bland graphics with no textures, you name it...  The plot and setting are extremely uninspired, if you are a veteran of Fallout franchise, you will feel a very strong deja vu.  Mutant plants on a food growing facility? Nuclear bomb worshipping fanatics? Robot army? Raiders? Fanatics preserving technology? List could go on but i didn't make it to the end of the game.   Quest system is tedious and lacks logic. I remember doing a lot of quests to make peace between two gangs in some village, even did some not obvious things, like disarming bomb on a bycicle quickly, but in the end they still shot each other, i checked on the internet and realized it's all because i didn't kill(on purpose) some drugs producing guy, who had nothing to do with the rivalry!   Though i liked some non-obvious thing in game, like strange creature in a cell which asks for candy, strange person standing in a pointless location, it's very rare in modern quest markered games with no mystery to them.   Overall, i don't recommend this game to Fallout fans, because it's nothing like it.",

It's okay (although I only played 46 minutes*, ~10 of which were character customization and another 20 dialogue). It made me want to play better post-apoc games, like Rimworld or Fallout. What I saw was very much in line with things I like, though. I don't think it's worth $40-60 tho. Go buy Fallout 4 for that money, or two copies of Rimworld, or something.  Pros: - Guns seem to do a bunch of damage, each shot I hit was an instant kill - A bit of character customization - Skill points for each character - Character portraits and loading screens are well-drawn  Cons: - Early 2000s-era 3d (think zoomed-in WH40K Dawn of War) - Low res (can be turned up to 1080p, but text is still oddly in 720p, as if the text isn't a vector. This is true for various art as well - You can't move characters separately outside of combat* - Some really strange skill checks* - No explanation of various mechanics, and what little is tutorialized is poorly explained and strangely ordered  *I had a character with the highest perception available at the time, and still they didn't notice what were apparently   oil drums full of explosives.   This combined with the fact that I had to move   all of my characters   to open a booby-trapped gate meant my entire team lost almost a third of their health, each (6 out of 21 HP).  Seriously, though: buy Rimworld, use the Combat Realism mod. Much more worth $30 than this.",

The characters feel fleshed out, and you can tell the care that went into making them interact with the world with you by their comments as you explore areas or encounter new people. Examples:   - You have an opportunity to pick up a mutant follower who never left the lab and has an innocent curiosity about the world, and shows it every time you discover a new area.  - There is a follower you can pick up about 30 minutes into the game, that like every other follower comments on the world. But what struck me was the cross interactions between her and another follower you can pick up almost at the complete end of the game. They didn't forget to add those little details that makes the world feel fleshed out.  If I had to pick my single gripe with the game, its the camera. It isn't smooth, pointing only in one of the 8 cardinal directions, and zooming in you cannot tilt the camera up to see ahead.

I am so sad i got things to do in the real world,the details in skills and items is really good and i use hours getting ammo and weapons perfect and i love it. there is so much content and i look forward to my next new game so i can make other choices and see how they affect the world, as some choices can have a great impact on the game.",

            "review_text": "I haven't played the original Wasteland or Fallout 1 or 2. My introduction to Fallout was through Bethesda's Fallout 3 and then Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas. I fell in love with the post-apocalyptic wasteland instantly and craved more. Years later and I find this game on Steam. Looking into it more, I realize this game sounds great. My friends have always talked about how great the old Fallouts are, and I've always wanted to play them, but just didn't have access. So with this game out, I decided I would not only get to play a more modern isometric Fallout, but also an updated classic cRPG that is part of what Fallout was entirely based on.  I'm only a few hours in the game, but don't plan to stop anytime soon. I'll be completely honest, it's a flawed game with bugs applenty (none-game breaking) and with a kinda wonky interface that takes time to get used to. It's a super slow game that takes time to get into and that doesn't have an overload on story (no SAVE THE WORLD kinda plot here, it's smaller and a more personal story). But if you like in depth RPG's and love Fallout/post-apocalyptic wasteland games, this game might be for you. It's a story customized to your choices and where you feel that your choices matter. On the other hand, your choices will let you know that no good deed goes unpunished, as all choices have consequences and no matter what you do, by helping someone, you're going to either hurt someone else, or let them get hurt.  Also if you like Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age, or D&amp;D, this is pretty much a post-apocalyptic setting D&amp;D in the real world gameplay wise. So there is that.  Overall, I do recommend this game. It's a flawed product, but I appreciate it for what it is, and how much work has gone into it. It's an accomplishment in the gaming industry to see such a successful Kickstarter for a game that has been so deserving for so long, and if you are able to accept it's bugs and problems, you will be rewarded for your adventures!",

Because in this game, if it can go wrong it absolutely will. Guns with a 1-3% jam rate seem to jam every other turn. Squad members with excellent skills in markmanship (handguns/etc.) will miss far more often than they hit.   In Wasteland 2, you will spend 10 minutes disarming a trap and unlocking a safe only to find absolute junk inside. Reload to try it again and you'll find a shiny new sniper rifle instead.  It's hilarious: I've never been so frustrated with a game that I couldn't stop playing.   As addicting as Fallout/Fallout 2, as frustrating as trying to tame a hyperactive six year old in a toy store.   Guns jam with staggering frequency. A gun that says it has a 5% jam rate? Try 45%. Seriously. In one firefight, where each of my squad members had a 75% or higher change to hit, not a single round hit the enermy... FOR THREE TURNS. It was incredible. I've never seen such a ridiculous display of gunnery incompetence...  Until my 98% to hit point-blank pistol shot went awry. Not once. Not twice. Thrice.   Wasteland 2 will punish you for even thinking that you have a chance. If you don't learn that F9 must be pressed before ANY action you will not progres. Your characters will miss the enemy, repeatedly shoot themselves, and somehow manage to catestrophically fail digging up something from the ground... resulting in two fresh bodies for the Arizona wastes to reclaim.  You will quickly learn that the only thing that Wasteland 2 is honest to you about is that there are a lot of things out there trying to kill you, including the mechanics of the game itself.  But it isn't all bad. When things go right it can be a lot of fun. The graphics are pretty good. The story is even better. And hey, you're playing a RPG about a post-apocalyptic America- no kidding your guns are going to miss every other shot.",

It's 100% in the spirit of the games that came before, be they the ancient artifact that is Wasteland, or the more direct analogue, Fallout. In fact, it immediately reminded me of the storytelling style of Fallout with the more capable squad-based skills and combat of the Fallout Tactics 'experiment'. Take the stengths of both, layer on the lore of the classic Wasteland. then run it through an extended Early Access period to ensure it delivers on its promises, and you have Wasteland 2.   I will say, this game is unforgiving. If you miss a sidequest opportunity the first time through an area, Wasteland does. not. care. That NPC could easily be gone the next time you visit... or worse. Whole zones play out differently based on how quickly you answer the call. Neglect a skill that was essential to solving a problem the way you want to, and you might have to admit defeat (or just do it the hard way.) Have a lot of regrets? Good, says WL2. That's life in the Wasteland. I'm impressed so far, and it all feels well done. Truly a game with an old soul, that learned a few lessons in the intervening years.

The game is absolutely brilliant, exactly what one could expect from Brian Fargo and the rest of the devs. I commend you for this priceless piece of gaming software you've just offered us. We've been waiting for a long time for this and you hit the jackpot.  First and foremost, bugs. Seriously...what are you complaining about? It's a game, you use programming languages to code it...of course it will have bugs, but of course! Nothing the devs can't handle in a couple of minor patches so...take it easy, everything will be alright in the near future. To be honest, I've got a couple of game breaking bugs but I just reloaded the savegame and all was fine again, so nothing I couldn't handle. Do not forget who these guys are...they are not a major corporation trying to steal your money with cheap advertisement and crap like that...these are true heroes in gaming history!  Setting - What can I say..it's extremely well achieved and everything else I might add would be redundant. You feel you're in deep ♥♥♥♥ everywhere you go. You start doubting everything and everyone...it's just..genius.  Soundtrack - Helps to emphasize the deep ♥♥♥♥ you're in. Brilliant once again.  Interaction with the world - The fact that you can send out a mortar to the people you're trying to save, says it all.   Interaction with NPCS (dialogue) - Now, the dialogue is AWESOME! You got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of options and your skills do influence them. Barter/Kiss ♥♥♥/Hard ♥♥♥ for instance. I find myself wanting to read more...the humor is all around also.  Story - Brian Fargo is the man. The dialogue, the setting, the quests, everything adds well to the story. Brilliant once again.  Difficulty - This is what a true RPG should be. Hard as hell to make you feel crap hits the fan everytime you move your mouse. Save often! Makes you think, strategize and use everything in your power to win and the sense of achievement is absolutely tremendous. Love it.  Character Creation - What can I say, it's good, oh so very good. Make sure you THINK before going ahead with your chars. Seriously, think about the ♥♥♥♥ that might find its way to you in-game and plan.  If you love old school RPGs like Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale and Fallout 1 and 2, you're gonna love Wasteland 2. Ignore what the trolls keep saying about looking unfinished. You'll soon forget all about it. One has to be patient. The juice is all there, it's a finished game with a couple of issues that will be solved eventually. Just buy it.  ",

            "review_text": "I wanted to love this game, sooooo much. I don't, but I like it. It's good, it's definitely worth playing, but this comes with some serious reservations.  First, the good: the range of options is nothing short of amazing. The return to the old model of some voice to augment mostly written dialogue clearly gave them huge amount of freedom, and I love the way the decisions *feel* like actual decisions, and not just 'Good guy / Bad guy' inane dichotomy decisions. No decision ever feels like the ideal one, and that's both difficult to execute and brilliant when done properly. The writing, by and large, is top notch.  The bad: It's very easy to create characters who end up as basically trash, and you almost have to play through once to know what you're going to need. Both your skills and attributes are locked once you select them. Skills you can make up for if you learn quickly, but you attribute allocation is pretty much locked once you create a character. Specializing in skills is hugely important if you don't want to save scum your way through all of the unlockables, but without knowing what NPCs are going to become available you can end up with very annoying redundancies. Given that a significant number of the skills are basically 'unlock X,' it starts to feel sort of silly.  The worst part, unfortunately, is the combat. It feels old, and not in a good way. For any fight that isn't a faceroll, you'll want to position your team before engaging and get it the first shot, guaranteeing your team at least some of the initiatve. Problem is, doing this is clunky to say the least. On top of that, cover (fairly necessary to keep fights from just being a straight up numbers game) is sparse and spread far apart most of the time...far enough that it's generally impossible to have more than a couple of your team in decent position. This problem is exacerbated by the weapon group disparity--ARs and sniper rifles (and occasionally energy weapons) completely outclass other weapon groups, a gap that only gets wider as the game goes on (although I will admit that my hand-to-hand bruiser does well, circumstantially). Maybe this is because I'm playing on hard, but enemies seem to have double or triple the action points of characters, allowing them to run obscene distances in a single turn or fire twice as much as characters.   The game relies heavily on combat, and for the style if play it's going for I felt like it was Jagged Alliace II lite. It uses almost all of the same systems JA2 does, but with less depth, or like X-Com, but with worse map design (for combat purposes--they're beautiful).   To clarify, this isn't a complaint that it's too hard--I *like* hard--it's that it's boring. There simply aren't a lot of options in the course of fighting and some skill and weapon choices, it becomes clear as you progress, are simply superior.   Short version: Everything about this game feels brilliant--writing, world, the player choices--but the simple / punishing combat model enourages simplicity and min/maxing in a way that takes away from the rest of the game.  So, worth buying and playing, but (and this is the first time I think I've ever said this) play it on easy or normal. Because the fighting is bland and making it harder just makes it take longer to get to the parts of the game worth playing.",

It feels fantastic to be back in the wasteland with all of it's interesting characters, mutated creatures, raiders, robots and various pop-culture references.  As a personal preference I don't quite like being forced to start with a squad of four blank slate characters instead of the single one you get in Fallout, but since it is faithful to the original Wasteland I can't really fault the game for that. A design aspect I DO have a lot of problem with however is that the enviroment doesn't fade when it's between the characters and the camera. When a character enters a room one would expect the closest wall to become translucent to allow the player to see what the character sees. As it is you are really forced to change the camera angle around several times in each room just to make sure you don't miss any containers hidden in corners.  That aside; this game is definitely worth it if you loved the old, and possible the newer, Fallout games.",

            "review_text": "So I'm a few hours into Wasteland 2 and I'm not especially hooked by it. For such a combat heavy game there is an insane amount of challenges for your other skills. About 60% of all loot is behind a locked safe/box/door which could either need electronics, safecracking or lockpicking to open, as well as this it could be trapped which you need perception skill to find. Already thats 5 skills you need just to open stuff. If you want to be able to sweet talk everyone, you'll need the three 'talking' skills (hard ♥♥♥, smart ♥♥♥, kiss ♥♥♥) and if you want to be able to complete optional objectives you'll need mechanical repair, outdoorsman, animal whisperer and alarm disable. You do not have enough skill points to do this with your starting team of four... Especially if you want them to actually be able to shoot anything, and as I said, that's pretty important in this game where killing is the only option half the time and the preferable one most other times (so far).  Having said that, I could easily see myself bypassing this skills hurdle later on in the game as levels are nicely frequent. I guess a way to bypass the lack of initial skill points could be overcome by killing some people in random encounters but I wouldn't put it past this game to have some sort of timer where the longer you take, the more the wasteland will kill you/itself/something.  A little thing that bothers me also are the graphics. The environments are beautiful however the character models are really ugly, low poly which is further accentuated by the fact that the gound they're walking on looks better than they do. But that's a minor gripe.  I reccomend this game only because I like the mechanics and the story so far is quite good.",

I've been considering buying this game, but was a little worried that a 'reboot' wouldn't live up to my nostalgaic expectations.   For the most part, I think this game did very well, both in catering to old-timers like me, as well as provide content and gameplay for everyone. A few pros and cons:  Pros -- Respectful of the old game without replaying everything; the relocating of the HQ was nice touch, for example. I wonder if new players felt lost at all with all the references to the old game? It seemed like it was well-written to avoid such confusion, but I'm biased. (Am I the only one who got misty-eyed over Ace's death?) There's some fun humor throughout, such as the E.T. cartridges north of HQ and the descriptions of the overgrown vegetables. The mix of puzzling and fighting for missions was good, and the sharing of equipment between characters seemed to be about as good as any game could ever hope for. I liked the combat controls -- a good mix of real-time and turn-based mechanics. Interesting locations, great graphics, satisfying combat, fun characterization.  Cons -- The controls for moving seemed really awkward. For example, trying to see objects in tight rooms (like Ryan's pen in the East Field) was a pain, and the 'fog of war' seemed stingy. It was sometimes hard to see where you could and could not go. This complaint plus the suddenness of saving Ralphy in the Rail Nomad camp made that quest aggravating -- couldn't find Ralphy right away, and then he drowned as I was trying to figure out how to save him. Not really fair for just entering the camp. The swearing was a little off-putting as well, not only in how it seemed 'canned' and unnatural, but also in how it seemed to not quite fit in with the tone of the game. So, in short -- awkward viewing controls, high difficulty (even on 'easy'), counter-intuitive puzzling, and clunky potty mouth.  With a choice only between recommending or not recommending this game, I give it a mild thumbs up. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would have chosen '6' .....",

I loved Fallout, so this ticked all of my nostalgia boxes. And really nostalgia is what this game is about. It's a top down post-apocalyptic cRPG with all the party building, xp grinding, side quest hunting goodness you could want. The different areas are mostly interesting. The side quests have multiple ways to resolve or screw up and don't always have a happy ending and often the game provides you with a choice of two (or three) equally bad outcomes. It's also rammed full of geek references  All in all it's hugely enjoyable.  But. It's not perfect. It's almost too caught up in nostalgia and could have done with some modern thinking applied to some of the mechanics. It's not particularly intuitive to start with and the lack of a decent in game tutorial will mean a lot of trial and error at the beginning. A few mechanics are clunky; for example, when you find a trap on a box you still have to explicitly use your demolitions skill to remove it as clicking the box with your demolitions expert will cause him to happily ignore the danger and open it anyway.   The camera thing, while pretty is a little pointless. I never found a situation where I wanted the view anything other than as high as possible and missing things due to not having the screen rotated the right way grates a little.  The first major location you hit will be one of two. Ag Center or Highpool. I hit Ag Center and it was long and tedious. It's not a great introduction to the game and may well result in people dropping the game at this point. Which would be a shame as it immediately improves 10-fold on moving on.  The second half of the game is hugely unfinished. Side quests can be completely bypassed by doing something slightly different and people will talk to you as though you were asked to perform the task and failed it. Then you'll find the side quest later on than you were supposed to, complete it (all the while being told it was a shame you couldn't resolve it) and everything will flip to the 'completed' state. It's as though inXile provided many paths to find/avoid/complete quests but didn't account for it in the dialog.  Nothing is insurmountable though and, with the odd little issue you can get through pretty much all the content. If you can put up with this, it's a blast.  It is, however, expensive. It's priced on a par with big AAA games. And while you can't say they're released bug free, they are generally a lot more polished than this is. I got it through Kickstarter and that was a perfectly acceptable price to pay for it. £30 though is too much.",

The main problem in my mind is the poor gameplay balance and how weapon damage, action points, and armour works. For example: laser weapons do more damage the higher your armour level is, which forces you to strip your team down to their underwear in order for them to survive a laser weapon battle. Yes, you read that correctly.  Despite the many updates and patches it has had, it still falls short of what I think it could have been. The developers also said pre-release that modding tools would also be released for the game - which hasn't happened as yet.

The Bad: The combat is good on the whole, but the way battles begin could be a lot better. The battles have an ambush feature, but outside of battle you can't set up an ambush for enemies you see ahead of you. You have two options, have one of your characters shoot at them first, or have all of your characters (which are typically bunch up in a formation I like to call 'Please throw a grenade at us') fire simultaneously. The second option usually results in one of your teammates getting a shotgun, or automatic volley, to the back. You can painstakingly set up each of teammates in position ahead of time, but that will usually trigger the battle. As with most games, enemy AI is not great and seldom do they use any sort of tactic other than running headfirst towards the nearest person and attacking. Like the original Fallout series some characters are voiced and some aren't. Nowadays this seems lazy. If TES IV Oblivion can get away with voicing thousands of NPCs with a handful of voice actors, so can this indy studio.  The plethora of jokes and Easter Eggs were a nice addition, but many of them have been used in both Wasteland and all of the Fallout games. They are getting old. Lastly, the sidequests were really tedious for the most part. Usually it involves getting a quest that leads to a secondary location in BFE, then needing to come back to the original location only to return to the second (or third location) again. Usually without anything interesting happening. I almost joined Matthias and his evil robot army just to wipe out all the Wastelanders that were too lazy to go on their own gopher runs.  The Good: Combat was solid and once you get your squad tuned up and outfitted, you can really wreak havoc on all manner of enemies.  Wasteland 2 gives a lot of playtime for the price. I bought it at full price and got sixty-three hours out of my first and only playthrough. That's a decent deal. Sure, other games have more replay value, but for an indy game sixty-three hours of story, with no repetition, is a good deal. Another bonus, for busy people, is that you can play it once and feel like you did pretty much everything. You don't have to play it again to get a feeling of completion.  Finally, the goats were hilarious.  As far as indy RPGs go, Wasteland 2 was worth the price tag.",

I haven't even beaten the game yet but I've played the first half through 3 different ways. There are some balancing issues with the skills and weapons, but I don't play these games for the battles as much as I do the story. I like that it doesn't do the Fallout 2 max at 99% weapon accuracy that somehow always seemed to miss far more often than 1%.  This game is VERY fun to play with a pary of max CHA and INT characters with everything else in Luck. It's fairly easy to do on 'Easy' mode once you have a hang of the battle mechanics. Making your 1st character the 'speaker' for the party and maxing them out with all the speaking skills really opens up the game to you. It's sometimes hard to remember to flip to another party member who has a certain speaking skill, so keeping it all in the 1st player makes it a little easier to not accidentally skip past opportunities.  The point being, this game is very malleable and totally adaptable to however you want to play it. Easy mode is perfectly balanced for people like me who play for the story - battles are still fun and you get close to dying, but it's not too often my whole party goes down. I haven't tried it, but I'm sure the hard modes make the strategy and skill in the battles a lot more intense and challenging in a good way.  This is one of those games you don't want to beat because you don't want the journey to be over. Loving this renaissance in realizing that Iso games are the ♥♥♥♥ for RPG players.  My one MAJOR gripe with the game is that nothing is marked on your area map. The maps are pretty confusing to navigate sometimes - especially in big areas with lots of individual houses. The pathfinding AI is leaps ahead of old Iso games, but it still has its glitches here and there. It would be great if at least the shops were labelled, but I see absolutely no logic in not labelling places you've been to.  Would be amazing for Wasteland 3 to be the prequel to the destruction - you know it's going to happen, of course, but maybe there are ways you can affect the future somehow. Would just be a neat twist on the apocalyptical genre.",

There are some bugs to be worked out still but it kept me hooked for 60 hours and if you are into it then it's likely to do the same for you. Easily 8/10 for me.

Here's the short version of my review:  I do not regret that decision.  I have bought a whopping two pre-order games in the past 5 years. The other was XCOM: The Bureau, because I was comming off a high from XCOM: Enemy Unknown and forgot that a shooter-XCOM was a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid idea. For Wasteland 2 it was due to a combination of love for Fallout 1&amp;2 and outside recommendations. Wasteland 2 did not disappoint. Mostly.  If you liked Fallout 1 or 2, or never played them, give Wasteland 2 a shot. The story tone overall is dark, but it makes sure to lighten things up as you achieve goals, and there is a lot of hidden comedy to be found, adding a little bit of sillyness to the stark seriousness of the wastes. That might sound incongruous, but Brian Fargo's directing and his team's writing hold it together in a way that is sensical and digestible without becoming mundane. Events have weight and depth, and that weight gradually lifts as you succeed in goals, if only momentarily as the story progresses.  My only complaints are in the combat system. It isn't bad by any means; throw a dart at a game listing and you'll hit something worse. It just seems to be lacking a bit compared to Fallout 2. Overall the leveling and combat system are a fair bit simplified from the Fallout games, which I dislike a bit; while there is something to be said for simplicity, Fallout was still on the friendly side of the line of where too much complexity becomes a chore rather than fun, if only just. I guess my main complaint is that it led to an odd situation where I completely avoided wearing armor throughout the entire game as if it where plague-ridden, whereas in the venerable Fallout if you weren't wearing Powered Armor by act 5 you'll just spontaneously explode. So maybe it's a petty complaint, but a complaint nonetheless. Maybe I should just be glad that was one in-game expense I could completely ignore.  Other than that, it is a little difficult to believe that a character could be a master sniper and yet unable to hit the broadside of a barn if you hand them a shotgun, but what the hell, it's more combat focused than Fallout 1 or 2, so it is reasonable to expect the mechanical focus to shift towards combat, even if it does lead to some silly levels of specialization.   In summary, there's a few petty gripes for the long-term Fallout fans, but much like Bethesda's work, this is overall a positive development in that vein. If you want a good post-apocalyptic story or a squad-based combat game, then look no further. It's not perfect, but it is quite good.",

            "review_text": "Wasteland 2 is basically Fallout / Fallout 2, but you control a team instead of one person (companions still exist, called recruits here). It was made by Brian Fargo, the guy who listed his name as the creator for those games, along with a few other relevant names to make by my definition a great team of developers for this kind of project such as Liz Danforth and Chris Avellone, among others. The combat plays like a cross between Fallout / Fallout 2 and X-Com: Enemy Unknown, and the non-combat feels just like Fallout / Fallout 2, as well. W2's story context is in the game itself scattered throughout books and dialogue, so there is no requirement to play the original Wasteland to appreciate this game. The soundtrack is great with the exception of the GOD AWFUL ending theme song, the art direction is as expected for a post-apocalyptic game, and the game is quite long for modern single-player game standards. That last point is generally a good thing in my opinion, but I think that W2 exceeds that sweet spot of game length to promote replayability to the point where many players would not be making an effort to play through a second time any time soon after finishing W2.  Some faults: -This game is full of bugs and inconsistencies, to the point where one would think that this game is still in beta due to how it is such a central part of the gameplay experience. These bugs and inconsistencies will never get fixed, so be aware that you are playing a game which feels as though it did not really undergo any quality control between the ending of the beta and when the live, 'complete' game launched. -In inconsistencies, there are many white-named items which indicate importance, but have no purpose whatsoever and are just mislabelled junk items. -Another important thing to consider with said inconsistencies is that the description for all energy weapons is backwards. Using the Meson Cannon as an example, it says that it has an armour threshold of 3, and that its threshold damage multipliers are 0.4x damage above 3 armour on the target, 0.9x at 3 armour, and 2.2x below 3 armour. This indicates that energy weapons do more damage to lower-armour targets. All energy weapons are listed in this format, and all of them are listed WRONG in this way; the skill description itself tells you correctly that energy weapons do less damage to unarmoured targets, but the weapons say the opposite. You end up doing 2.2x damage with the Meson Cannon to targets with above 3 armour and 0.4x damage to targets below 3 armour, and so on for every energy weapon. -Pistols, sub-machine guns, and shotguns are pretty worthless because of their range. I believe that the highest range I saw was 21 metres with mods to extend the range as far as possible, whereas I had assault rifles often over 40 metres, and sniper rifles over 50 metres. This makes a HUGE difference in combat efficacy. Melee as a main combat discipline is also worthless for the same reason, but it works well enough if the enemies get close enough to you where you do not have to go to them to use melee. -Portraits are reused HEAVILY, to the point where supposedly meaningful NPCs end up sharing the same portraits with nobodies from the wastes. It seems really lazy imo to only make a small handful of portraits and recycle them; not using any at all would have been a better choice than reusing the same several. -The proper endings, like with the endings for the Fallout games, is the phoned-in slideshow which cheapened the efforts put forth to complete the game.  All in all, this is a great game in spite of its problems, and I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the original Fallout games. The devs like to tout that someone once called it 'game of the year,' but let us be honest here: unless that year is 1996 or prior, it most likely will not be the best game of any given year that you play it.",

With the pros there's a solid combat system, lovely music score, solid story and properly fleshed out characters out there. Some love you on sight while others hate you, and of course there are some that just don't really care about you until you do something.   Most of all your decisions make an impact on the world while some not being obvious. Do you help this faction or that other one? Can one of your decisions is to do nothing and hope it solves itself? Yeah, you can choose to do nothing. And then you get to deal with all the consequences of those decisions.   Oh, and if you feel like it you can kill everyone you meet. Is this a good idea? Probably not... but this kind of thing is what I'm going to judge other RPGs on. Such as you don't like how someone looked at you? You can kill them. You don't like goats? You can shoot them. Don't like Mr. Boss Man telling you what to do? Yeah, you can shoot him to. Probably won't end well though.  Sadly with all games there are cons. Such as random encounters using the same map repeatedly. Slow on response, especially on the world map.

Easter Eggs (for now i found one that made me laugh, still looking for more) The combat is fun, especially when 5-6 monsters appear next to you and you realize you have no grenades or tnt The story is interesting and keeps me playing The party building is great once you understand it. Took me 3 tries to get a group with most skills + de ones i get from the NPC in AG Center(since my first char i made him surgeon and computer science :P(same skills that npc had) The replayability i already notice is good since decision you make impact the game for good, so next time you may want to chose a different path. All in all i'm closing to 30 hours and having fun, good game.",

            "review_text": "I didn't play the old Fallouts to compare with this game, and I don't want to compare. In fact, I like to see every single game by itself, and, for my taste, I think Wasteland 2 really worth my money.  I not finished the game yet but I already played it a lot. I like the combat mechanics - in which you have to buy and do a good use of ammunition -, and choose specialities for each weapon, having a lot of space to move with balanced AP. Basic turn-based combat, right? But this seems more free and even realistic to me. And it's nice to create a character and give him all habilities and particularities you want, even writing a bio! So I can have somebody that is good on weapons, another on healing, another on locks and alarms, etc.  One of the most interesting things in this game is the choices we have to make, and the reactions of all the world about it. Some games promise to give us freedom to do anything, but the ends are always the same. In Wasteland 2 you really see things changing, now or later. Some choices are easy, and others are really drastic. So you really need to think about everything.  Oh! And I really like the humor on this game. I laugh about the junks I loot, I like to read the lore, and the achievements are also funny. Everything is always getting me by surprise.  Graphics are good, too. A little boring, but it works well in high quality in my old pc. And until now I didn't have problems with graphics or bugs, just some delay on characters movements. But keep in mind that they will brings a big change soon, so graphics will be better, we'll have mod support, etc.  I highly recommend it! Give Wasteland 2 a chance if you like turn-based, choices, humor and post-apocalyptic world! It will give you a good time, some laughs and a lot of indecisions. :)",

            "review_text": "This game in my opinion is what fallout 3 should have been if they did not make a first person RPG adaptation. The game shows immense effort the creaters conributed to the game. From the scripted scenes to the artstyle, this game is very well polished and is considerably addicting. What I love about wasteland 2 is the fact that it does not really hold your hand throughout the entire game, the outcomes you see are totally based off your decisions. This game is not easy either, even in medium diffuculty you will find yourself having to revive your squad members if you did not think of a well thought strategy. Despite the few bugs I have encountered, the game is a gem that is underrrated. I am surprised that this game is not as popular I think it should be. My tips for the game are to spread your skills evenly throughout your squad and make your two of your squad members have a surgeon skill unless you want one of them to die you heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I am playing the Directors Cut and have immplemented over 30 hours, for some reason I cannot write a review from Directors cut....",
