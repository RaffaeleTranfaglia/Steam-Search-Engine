            "review_text": "Broken beyond belief. Damn near everything I have done in this game has basically caused it to shut down one way or another. Between some sort of crash from trying to sell an item or trash something down to a runtime error for simply walking down a hallway, you'll restart this game more times than you'll ever care to. Oh, and sanity? Yeah, consider that lost with the constant grinding sound of repeatedly walking into a walk ever split second with a full suit of armor on when you're walking down another hall, stuck on absolutely nothing, or just at a full stop standing there.  Oh, and if you think achievements might save the game somehow? They won't. They're broken. They don't unlock. And cards? Well, I can't be ♥♥♥♥ed enough to even bother trying to get one or see if they're even selling on the marketplace here.  All of this is sad because, if anything, the game at least looks competant. If the developer would fix these issues and other slight problems like the invenory down arrow being a not aligned properly up arrow, this would have been a casual enough dungeon crawler work a buck or two during a sale to kill some time. Instead it's nothing but highly broken, pretty muh unplayable garbage you'll put a refund in for before you reach the second level of a map like I somehow managed to do.",
