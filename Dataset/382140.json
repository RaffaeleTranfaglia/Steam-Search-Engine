            "review_text": "Agree with everthing in the top review.   It's not that it's out right bad, there is nice polish and such, but once you start playing the game is so very linear. Go here, attack this, move on. There is no consideration of your actions, like where you go or how to spend resources. Nothing feels important in terms of your actions.  In short, when a rouge like is just dice rolls, it doesn't matter how well presented it is, if I have no choices. As mentioned in the top review a rework of the layout would be needed or a reworking of fundamentals in the game, otherwise this is about as deep as clicker heros.  Not all bad, but certain design fundamentals, haven't come off here.",

            "review_text": "You pretty much get what the trailer shows, a survival game where you travel down a hotel, scavenging supplies, building weapons, upgrading safehouse and repeatedly dying. The game has some replayability thanks to unlocking perks which give you a special start bonus, though some of those are near useless while others superior over everything else.  Combat is simplistic and turn based, only real option being deciding if it's worth the risk to trade blows or retreat, it could do with more options. It's the stats, equipment and some dice rolling that decides if you win for the most part. Some fights are unavoidable too, while others can be bypassed entirely or occur in side areas.  The game is randomly generated which adds to replayability but also makes obtaining the components for your desired weapon that much harder.  And there's multiple endings too, if you're engaged enough to want to look for them. All in all, if the trailer interested you, go for it.",

            "review_text": "This game is alright. Spending money on it is a little absurd, it could've done just as well as a free flash game.  Combat is basic but it works. Its one of those games where raising the dificulty just makes finding items to win the game harder, and makes enemies gain health and damage. The intro story sets up the game, with three very different end outcomes. There is no reason to play after winning once. There are perks you can use that mildly affect the game, but other than that its nothing special. Definitely not worth $15, but for 50% off maybe a little more worth it.",

            "review_text": "Fun turn based roguelike. You can try different 'builds' by pumping up different stats so you can equip different weapons. You unlock perks that are used in repeated playthroughs to add variation to your strategy.  I won my first game on normal mode about 11 hours in, I look forward to playing more on harder difficulties.  I love the notes, voice recordings, photo fragments, etc. They really flesh out the world.  The graphics are basic but stylizied. The interface could use some polish, finding the correct recipes in the crafting menus can be time consuming.  Overall a great game. Glad I grabbed it!",

            "review_text": "Honestly, a good Rogue-like should not be 90% luck. You can be the greatest tactician of all time, but some games will just refuse to give you anything to work with; all of your gaming skills mean nothing when what little food you get is rotten, you can not craft that antidote for the eternal poison, and the game thinks that kitchen knife from the third room is the only weapon you will ever need or should have access to.  Skyhill is pretty much one of those Rogue-likes. The playtime is entirely dependent upon how far the game feels like letting you go. Stats give such pathetic bonuses that leveling up feels pointless once you're accurate enough to reliably hit enemies ('Yay! I got .2% extra dodge chance and plus .8 damage on my stick!'), and you will constantly be relying on the RNG to not give you impossible requirements for fixing elevator panels ('Oh yeah, five floors down and I definitely built a generator with all the supplies I don't have, game.') so you can make those frequent trips back to your apartment to craft everything that requires you to be there or to heal up after one enemy crits three times in a single battle. Eventually, a merciful roll of the dice will just give you an easy but slow grind straight to the first floor via handing out plenty of medkits or crafting supplies.  Story? After the very first newspaper clipping, I called the easy 'twist ending' that you can get, and I'm certain any other player who has read a few books or seen anything shoveled out of Hollywood in the past ten years will predict it as well. The other potential story lines are not really stories at all due to having so little content within them.  I bought the game on sale and I still feel like I wasted my money. Once you've had a successful run to the end, there is probably not going to be much drive to do it again unless you love speedrunning luck-based games or just want to waste time with a mouse-only game.",

Then try to make your way down to Level 1. You fight all kinds of monsters. Never do you feel cheated in combat. You put points into certain skills, and use weapons and plan fighting accordingly. The game says you can target certain parts of the body to hit harder, i have seen it on a couple monsters but maybe i just havent found it on the otheres. Anyway good game with amazing art, and the feel is very dark. Recommended.",
