    "description": "Hold the line as your booster rocket pushes you to increasingly insane speeds after every lap in this high speed, unforgiving, 3rd person racer! Watch out for blocks of ice and the edge of the track or you'll explode into a scattered pile of parts. Drift off the fast line and an opponent will edge their way to 1st!",
