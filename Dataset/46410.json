I actually like it better than torchlight (not better than torchlight 2). To get it to run on win 8.1 in Avencast options you have to keep the resolution set to default, it will crash on HD res. also I had to uncheck the video box at the bottom. the game seems to like it set to all the settings with the asterisk. Im really enjoying the game so far. the controls take a little getting used to but it has a good story and great level design and creepy atmosphere in some places with some puzzles as well. Also its not point and click like most games like this. you control using a-s-w-d which I prefer, simple attacks are L / R mouse buttons major magic attacks are set up with hot keys, you can customize all the settings. The graphics are a bit dated but its a solid game. I would say its worth the $10 price tag but even better on sale.",

There is a finite number of mobs, so there isn't a lot of grinding and this force the player to spend wisely his upgrade points. Extremely low replay value and a gameplay of 20~ hours if you're in a hurry, also you can access the option menu only when in an active game and not in the starting menu, and this is a bit annoying since the game starts with a low resolution and doesn't remember the previous settings.

            "review_text": "What is there to say about Avencast? Well, the gameplay is definitely Action RPG, for one thing, as the player contends with room-fulls of enemies by making best use of a variety of spells, and survival depends mainly on staying out of the way of danger (By dodging. Dodging constantly). You are given two different skill trees to draw from, one mainly dedicated to melee attacks, and the other to ranged (and a third set for summoning spells) and while you are free to invest in both, the damage of every spell in each set is governed by a separate attribute; therefore it seems most efficient to just pick one so as not to have to spread those attribute points too thin.  Other things of note: the game is pretty much 100% voice acted, and there's a fair amount of eye candy in the level design. Overall, it's an acceptable game if you're interested in a straightforward, combat-centric fantasy title.",

The spell casting requires you to press a series of keys. Once I targeted my crosshair on the monster, I had to press left + up + mouse 1 key which causes my character move to the left and aim is off. You can't move while casting and even if you bind a spell to a short key, you are bound to get hit.",

Apart from that it gives you some riddles and puzzles - very easy ones and not so easy ones. Even the story is quite nice. The level system and ability trees make sense - although I only played the 'soul path'.  Story, gameplay mechanics, loot and level up system are quite motivating. I don't know if I would go for another playthrough on the 'blood path' though - we'll see. Don't judge it too hastily and try different settings, especially for the controlls/camera. I played it on normal difficulty and with a following camera. It never got too easy or frustratingly difficult.  At this price you won't expect tripple a gfx, hans zimmer music or bioware style voice acting. Still all the technical aspects of the game are - at least for me - much better than expected and executed quite well. I'd rate this game 75/100. You should give it a try.",

The choices here are much more flexible and tactical but the casting system and the magic itself lacks the pristine polish and substance found in Magicka or Nox and there is no lightning magic (an odd developmental choice, in my opinion).  You can either choose to cast spells via an arcade style input (left, right, click... etc.) or by hotkey. I prefer arcade input myself. The story is cliche as hell but the setting is pulled off decently and worth a two-finger round of applause.  Now, the SDK provides a good deal of potential and has a very detailed and easy-to-use readme. I put together a somewhat large mod myself, overhauling the Soul Magic tree and even added more spells.   Overall, Avencast is certainly worth the asking price if you are a magic-user enthusiast like me and definitely worth it when on-sale.",

The plot, however, reads like baby's first adventure. Seriously, play it for the mechanics and the ability to throw magic around without worrying about a mana bar. Hell, take it up a notch and, for those 21+, take a drink whenever a storytelling trope shows itself. Halfway through the first major arc you'll be seeing triple.",
