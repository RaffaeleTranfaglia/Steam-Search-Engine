            "review_text": "This game is a well developed asymmetric RTS game, featuring 3 vastly different factions.  The humans are network based, all the constructs are linked and the game-play is heavily advantagous for those who prefer the turtle approach thanks to the turrets and the compact design their playstyle promotes. They are also the only faction capable of teleporting 6 units at once to any spot on the map where you have visibility allowing you to quickly reinforce troops if needed. Their elite unit sends a laser beem straight forward in a line, damaging any enemy ground unit (imho. this is the weakest elite unit, but they have air-superiority anyways thanks to their airplanes and how small their storages for the airplanes are).  On the completely opposite side this this is the Goo, the playstyle of the goo focuses on aggressive hit-and-run tactics, their elite unit can cause serious havoc and is also able to climb any obstacle and destroy enemy buildings and units by simply being around them. They are very strong if coming in a pack and when lacking form they can devour an entire base by simply being there. That said, their forms (units) do have a lot of advantages such as range, ability to target airplanes and pure damage. The goo has no structures, they are a fluid faction in every meaning of the word.  The Beta are most normal of the factions, specifically said by the Devs to be intentionally so for new players to get used to the game, but they are still very strong and definitively a force to be reckoned with. Their elite unit is a walking production facility that sends out miniature nuclear bombs and is able to attack any close-range enemies by having units mounted ontop of it. This is one of the big strengths of the Beta, some of your units can mount walls and the elite unit, allowing you to create a strong permimiter that is very hard to break through. If you then decide to go on the offensive, the elite unit will help you take down most resistance, having what is probably the strongest of the elite units in the game.  As for the campaign, it is very well made, although, it is a bit short, allowing you to get used to each of the factions while also deliviring a great story that they have confirmed will be expanded. Note: It will come through DLC.  Now, on a more negative note, while humans are strong, they often feel unflexible as you might not be able to expand anywhere due to it not always going so well building uphil and some areas are just blocked off for building. For the Beta, that just means you place it somewhere else, for humans, it means stop.  Also, the game, at least so far, allows for only up to 4 players, meaning you can't even have a 3v3 with one of each faction on each side.",

            "review_text": "First off, this is a quality game. It is well made, great cinematics, high quality graphics (although the scenes a bit on the dark side) - yes worth the $49 release price IMO. I have now spent about 9 hrs playing and still working things out. It is not complicated, just an initiial learning curve of where and how to build structures, do upgrades, keep resources flowing etc. There is ingame help but I found it to be hints rather than a hand holding guide which I needed when i started playing.   There are 3 factions to learn to play- each quite different,  Like other RTS games the idea is to build up a base/bases and pump out fighting units and destroy the enemy. You only need to collect one type of resource. You can have up to 200 units.  Technically the game plays very smooth and well on the main, i have had the game crash once when I was right clicking madly.  Is it fun? Well yes, I am enjoying the campaign I have played so far. The campaign consists of 15 missions- 5 for each of the 3 factions so plenty of opportunnity to learn all aspects of the game.  The skirmish mode seems a bit limited as there are only 8 options of maps which include number of players each map.  I have not played the MulitPlayyer as yet, due to none of my friends having this game, so cannot comment there.  Nothing can beat my AoM/AoE games but I did enjoy the slightly different style of game here and glad I bought it. If you enjoy space RTS games this is a nice one. 8/10       ",

If this game had faster updates and better developer communication with the community it could have been one of the best RTS`s out there.  Multiplayer: After playing 334 hours and ranking high on the 1v1 leaderboard im totally jaded with this game. Its not a game you should buy hoping for a lasting multiplayer experience, at least not with what the game offers currently.  Single player: The campaign itself is decent with cool cutscenes and a nice lore surrounding the factions, however i wouldnt recommend you buying this game solely on the single player experience, as the campaign itself is not long enough or that interesting compared to the price your paying.  Final opinion; So why do i recommend this game, its a decent game with a cool art and functional gameplay that has the potencial to get better if the developers put their dedication back into the game. But as things stands the game is sort of in limbo waiting for the developers get their act together. I will still recommend it because it has potential that`s the main thing to look for in this game.  So buy it if you wanna support the developers or just want to play a short singleplayer campaign if you are bored. Dont buy it if you want a solid and competitive multiplayer experience.",

            "review_text": "This is an amazing game. One of the best new RTS games to come out since the Dawn of War series. Incredibly well made; the production values are top-notch. The voice acting, the graphics, the models, and the sound are all incredibly well done. The writing is very solid - telling a familiar sci-fi cautionary tale with an excellent twist.  The gameplay is smooth and well thought out. The only complaint I can recall is that the mini-map isn't as full-featured as I expect from a modern RTS. You can't seem to (or at least, I never could) click on the mimi-map to instantly move your camera to that location. But these misses were minor, few, and far between.  By far my favorite part of the game was the titular faction. The Grey Goo is the most innovative RTS concept I've ever seen. I dare say that they perform the 'Zerg motif' better than the Zerg do - and before you declare me a blasphemer, let me explain. Part of the Zerg flavor was always that they arrive at a planet. murder a bunch of living things, and then use that biomass to increase their own numbers. Sort of like a sci-fi version of a necromancer: your fallen enemies increase your strength.  And that was awesome. But that flavor rarely found its way into the mechanics, really. Sure, you could infest a Terran HQ to produce an infested marine. But that was it. For the vast majority of the time, you harvested crystals and vespene, just like everyone else. And you spawned units out of buildings (albeit gooey buildings) just like everyone else. Not a lot of the 'murdering for biomass' flavor in there.  But the Grey Goo take that concept to its logical conclusion in the mechanics. You have only one production 'building' - the mother goo. It can roam around looking for suitable mass to absorb, but it is also a dangerous unit in its own right. It can traverse any terrain, and it can occupy the same space as enemy units and buildings, damaging them and healing itself while it does so. And its health is the only resource the goo needs. It spends goo (its health) to spawn specialized constructions. Mechanisms made from goo that perform specialized tasks (like murdering things from far away). Then, once the murdering is done, the enemy becomes goo and heals the mother goo. It's a perfect implementation of the 'murdering for mass' flavor that the Zerg made us fall in love with.  But the Grey Goo is just one part of this game that makes it so excellent.  All in all, a highly recommended game.",

The three race dynamic is one that has been in use since Starcraft put it on the map and this game does it justice. Each of the factions has a unique infrastructure and units that make for wildly different strategies when played. There is a single player campaign that involves cut scenes and voice acting which has a high production quality. SP and MP will give plenty of value out of this game.  At times there seems to be a balance issue but that may be just my perception with only 10+ hours into the game thus far.  The interface could use some improvement in some places, but overall you feel in complete control of your forces and are not limited by interface restraints as you are in some of the other RTSes that I have played lately.  Keep it coming Petro.  UPDATE #1: Petro, why only 4 players? We need bigger maps and bigger battles.",

Then after watching videos and actually getting to play the game I loved it. I mean music in the game is made by Frank Klepacki and if you enjoyed all the classic command and conquer music and red alert 1&amp;2 my god he does some good stuff. I do recommend this game to anyone who likes the old feel of an RTS building, expanding and waging war upon your enemies.   The GreyGoo may be a very odd name for an RTS, but actually it fits quite perfectly for the Race the Grey Goo and what I mean by this is the race is very unique from any RTS I've seen the way you can form your units and gathering resources it different, then your Goo can run over everything and when I mean everything I mean EVERYTHING!!!! it insane.",

It takes many of the best elements from the C&amp;C series and incorporates some progressive new ideas of it's own!   - Single player is incredibly well polished, with great cutscenes, although the story itself leaves something to be desired.   - The QWERTY hotkey-bar setup takes a little while to get used to but is generally much more user friendly than other RTS hotkey configurations like SC and AoE.   - The foliage cover mechanic is a fun twist to traditional cloaking.   - So far balancing between the three factions looks solid, but I haven't played that many multiplayer games yet so we'll have to wait and see if it still feels right after that.   - I enjoy having the resource rate meter on the top right, like Supereme Commander and other games in that vein vs. just a straight up resource count.   - The multiplayer games I've played with my friends so far have been action packed from the get-go. Even with 2 factions having walls, turtling doesn't seem to work as a valid strategy for too long.   - The unit upgrades in the game are more strategic than, 'This just makes my units beefier,' like SC2 where you pretty much have to get some upgrades without thinking too hard about them.   - The Goo is probably the most unique faction I have EVER played in any RTS game. It will be a lot of fun to master!   My only major gripe with this game is that the multiplayer scene looks a little scant so far.

If there were more RTS games that were coming out which weren't absolutely a complete waste of time, then I should think Grey Goo might still be up there on my top five list. Because it's really sublime. Good soundtrack, good gameplay, all the modern conveniences of a modern RTS (which I appreciate).  Ordering your units around just feels smooth. Unlike some other games, Grey Goo just feels uncluttered and simplistic. I love it. The shortcut keys to quick select units and buildings makes one feel like a pianist, and I love that too. I also like that, it seems to me, the tips on the loading screens are actually useful for once. And that's awesome.  The Grey Goo faction is also pretty neat.  Also, I can't stop saying Grey Goo for some reason. It's a name that really rolls off the tongue. Bonus points for that.  In short, it's an RTS. You like RTS? Get this game. If not? Don't bother.

The base-building and unit-building might have been a bit more expansive with more units and buildings to select from, but otherwise I liked what the game had on offer gameplay-wise.   Apart from the raw gameplay, I think the reason why I'm writing this at all is because I love the game's story, atmosphere, graphics and soundtrack so much. I admit, I'm not the most competitive RTS fan, but I can't get enough of listening to Frank Klepacki's (He's a big name when it comes to game composers, I believe) soundtrack for this game and contemplating the game's different factions and characters.  I have probably spent 3-4x more time in listening to the soundtrack and thinking of the game world than I have playing the actual game. The humans in Grey Goo are so interesting with how, in Ecosystem 09 at least, the humans are small in numbers and one single human settlement is both managed and developed by a single human scientist.  The graphics in Grey Goo are spectacular and head over heels above the graphics of the other RTS games I've played.   In all honesty I'd like the idea of having the creative design in Grey Goo combined with a more 'sandboxable' experience such as a city builder or a turn-based tactics game. The sci-fi lore, art design and soundtrack are just to good!   ",

Rather than try and talk through every single bit and piece of the game I'm going to give my first impressions, then later on I'll try and throw something more complete up.  First things first: it's gorgeous. The cutscenes, the units, the buildings, everything feels really solid. I will say that my computer chugged a bit on the menu and at the beginning of each cutscene, but my computer (while pretty nice) isn't top of the line. Specs at the bottom if anyone cares. Weirdly enough the actual gameplay doesn't seem to have any slowdowns at all, so I'm wondering if it's just some minor glitch that'll be patched out.  Next up: it's fun! Most of the gameplay is pretty intuitive, the units respond in fairly interesting ways, and in general the game feels like a competent studio worked on it. The only real issue I had as the Beta in the campaign was a mild misunderstanding of the hub system, and if I'm being honest that's probably more down to me being oblivious than anything.  I haven't tried multiplayer at all as yet (waiting on a couple of friends to pick it up), but the gameplay seems like it would translate really easily and well to multiplayer.  The tutorial section of the campaign does a good job of explaining things, and the fact that the tooltips are visible without being overwhelming or intrusive was really nice.  Apparently there's a map editor, and I can hardly wait to start tinkering around with that!  Apparently a fair number of the people in the developer came out of Westwood, and I can only say hurrah to that! I loved me some Red Alert back before the black hole known as EA destroyed them and it's good to see that they seem to be back in business!   One thing I wish they'd bring back is the faction system that existed in Emperor: Battle for Dune. The faction/subfaction choices added a lot of spice to that game, though the overall game sadly doesn't really hold up these days.  PC specs:  CPU: AMD Phenom II 1100t black x6 (running @ 3.3 Ghz) Memory: 8gb 1600 hz RAM GPU: Nvidia GTX 760 (EVGA card)  My hard drive is pretty much garbage, but that just means slightly longer load times.",

            "review_text": "Here's the thing, I like RTs and am a hardcore fan, but I don't like to go pro online, or anything like that as I never like online systems, and the same will be with this game, so I play skrimish, campaign and with friends, but STILL there are major problems I see.   Cons-  1. The Humans- The humans are more for turtling, but you can't build beyond your starting position most of the time because conduits can't go over any terrain basically. So supply lines get huge and you must divert your forces to protect the miners. The Beta and Goo don't have this problem, and THIS IS MAJOR!!!! because resources run out which pisses me off a little. Just make it either slow regeneration or less income once it reaches the bottom don't remove it all together.   2. Unit Cap- I don't want a game very similar to starcraft. I want a game like CnC with as many units as the computer can take, massive.... MASSIVE battles(also like many huge RTS games) having a unit cap takes away from that. It makes the game more limited.   3. Player Count- 4.....really? Only 4? From what I've seen 4 players is it which at that point I'm like, 'LAME!'  4. Campaign gameplay- Well if you've played it, most people will probably be like c'mon wanna play the Goo campaign. Well 15 missions essentially and 90% of them are kill the enemy. there are at most 3 that aren't 'kill the enemy'. It's fine if it's like that but maybe have cool assaults or epic maps, nah. There are never more than 3 more commanders on the field. You only get an ally for one mission(haven't 100% the goo yet as I need a brake from 'KILL THE ENEMY!') and that mission is kill the enemy. Not hold off and distract long enough to detonate the bomb(sorry spoilers) just kill the enemy.   There are probably other problems but before I stop.   5. Player Content- ok love it how they support the community....steam workshop? Um can you mod this for more unit cap or stuff like that?(You can but the config is a .MEG file...REALLY?!) They do support it but they shouldn't rely on people to make cooler maps to add to their collections. There is only like 7 maps...only 7 and most of them are very similar. I REALLY HOPE that the community through mods if they can and maps make this game much better. If they can make unlimited unit cap and balance the races more to cope with that. Make it so that the player count is 8 or above for better play(if they can) etc...  Pros...Sorry fror bashing on a game but people need to understand from a casual gamer what it is like playing a game and what you should get, but here are the pros.   Camapign Cutscenes- Beautiful and stay with the story. They can immerse you in the universe fairly quickly but sadly what it seems like you're doing from the cutscenes doesn't happen in the gameplay half the time.   Factions- Now I know I bashed on the humans but the factions are unique, especially the Goo. If they kill something they use the matter to grow and reporudce more quickly. The regular goo can quickly consume enemies that are alone or in small groups and can flee up terrain once done. owever to limit their OPness on the ground they get no air. Sadly the Goo and Humans are very similar to Earth's 2160 counterparts.   Epics- Now the epics are essentially the Titans of Warhammer. They are ultimate units and deserve to be for taking up 70 unit cap. However each is unique to the faction. The humans sport a collosal humanoid robot with a large beam that seeps and kills most units in it's path. The purger for the Goo is the ultimate evolution and can attack from range while also getting close and absorbing the enemies through a potent (I guess melee attack). The Beta get a mobile fortress which can produce units and house them for close range defense.   Learning Curve- Factions are easy to learn but definitely hard to master.   Now I know it looks like I dislike this game, I don't it's just I expect better now. I mean to put a unit cap and then express how the game would run smoothlymakes me say 'really? maybe the game runs smoothly not because of the servers but the unit cap?' Also the factions still need work even though polish was done some very clear things should be fixed. like Humans and Beta should be able to build more command centrs(Goo can.....and humans need it to continue to expand). This game is worth the money but not more worth it and that makes me sad. Until player content streams in this game is not that great to me. Any RTS fans wanting something new though go ahead and try it, you'll get your money's worth.   Rating: 7/10 (Not bad, but not great either).",

But sometimes I still have some urge to play as a commander of an army after I've watched a movie like the Lord of the Ring or Starship Troopers, that's why I still have been trying to search for an RTS game which does not required me to have light speed reaction, then I heard about Grey Goo and finally have a chance to try it.  here's what I think about this game  Pros - slow paced, this game doesn't forced you to have light speed reaction and apm, but still faster than Sins of a Solar Empire. It's a very good time killer if you have 1 hour before you need to do something else, and have no idea what to play in your Steam library. - no micromanagement like activating units' skill, it's more about units position and type - EXCELLENT game design, it has a very fun and unique resource management and base building mechanic. Building base and army feel less chore than classic RTS, and more easy because there's automation for building units and base - great graphic. It bring me back some memory of SC1, but I wish units could have more texture detail  Cons  - only 3 factions with 9-11 unit types per factions, I wish it'll go the same direction as DOW instead of SC2, DOW is not as balance as SC2 but people still love the game because it fulfill their multi-factions war fantasy - a wall of core-gamer and competitive gamer bashing suggestions and ideas from casual gamer. That's why there's not much hope for new units and new factions  - Human units design looks too simple....it's just some random floating objects with gun for me",

And a cool cover system is in place by having overhead forest canopy that blocks you from enemy sight so you can spring an ambush.   Playstyle is very similar to Command &amp; Conquer and Warcraft 3. Easy to learn but difficult to master. At least from my experience. Other more proficient RTS gamers may find the game too easy. But I do recommend this game to all levels of players.

But still this campaign will be EPIC toward the end of this game + I like Grey Goo Game unit variation. It have so many potential outcome + User interface is likely distinguish based on the faction characteristic. It is very intuitive and easy remember like MOBA QWER keyboard style + Best Auto macro unit training/ autoproduction (you don't require to repeat many times to train units. it have automatic queue-cycle that will repeat it self until you decide to stop its production. Sitback and enjoy but don't forget to rally point) + This game is easy to learn and hard to master. very depth strategy in this game require you to know each unit, there will be no useless unit as each unit have its own benefit and its own capabiltiy. Each unit also have very unique attribute and modest upgrade to make sure the game will be fun to play + Upgrade system is trully relevant and well balance. It is very crucial to upgrade your own army to counter enemy strategy. I found each of faction's upgrade are really efficient to counter enemy strategy. + modable game. Damn sure this game will have good modding to extend its replayability in future + nostalgia of CNC when i was child + good music, my fav soundtrack is 'agile maneuvers'. Great job Frank Klepacki (i got it free) + &lt;spoiler&gt; my speculation of this game :   fourth faction is 'the silent ones' according to morra/beta. the goo faction is good guy here that will defend sentient like human from extinct due to the silents one invasion   + (will add more in future)   WHAT I DISLIKE ABOUT THIS GAME?  + very few map to play + please improve matchmaking + please make sequel fast + no very super hard AI, after couple of game i found hard AI of 3 faction is rather easy and it have same strategy every each time I play + minor bug occur occasionally but it don't appear to distract gameplay (lucky me for having zero crash, I am just using nvidia gt 525m) + no matchmaking player coop versus ai (2 vs 2) + i hope in future there will be 8 player maximum to play + please make round cycle path Guard command (button G) + unit that hold position still force move if collide/intersect with other unit's pathfinding movement. I don't want relocate again my unit and then hold postion again. Waste of time to focus on this matter. + no passive stance behaviour, in other RTS games unit can have 3 or more stance which is passive, hold postion, aggrasive + no replay like starcraft 2 (that is really demerit points!) + (later i will update what I dislike about this game, it is so hard to notice fault within this game)   MY FIRST EXPERIENCE PLAY MULTIPLAYER (UNRANKED) :  I choose beta as primary faction, my enemy is human and we fight unraked match making. We played Stalker's Rise map and my position was west and my opponent was east. I did early scout and find out my enemy is focusing in economy and rushing to second and third refinery, I finished my second refinery after build small factory, I follow my intuition by trains commando to scout every potential of resources that opponent may place its extractor. This time, i have advantage of army while my opponent have advantage of resources and hard base defense (i scout his base again). I think carefully and made decision to favor more on offensive path than defense. few minute later, I have an adequate army to raid his base but as i scout then, opponent base is likely hard to breach. In meantime I did discover enemy's 5 extractor in total while I only have 3 extractor. That time I only have two choice whether to raid his base or harass his economy. So, I decide to harass his economy by destroying his undefend extractor with all my army. Lucky me, my opponent just retaliate with only quarter population army while not having chance to fight back with my half maximum population army. I managed to destroy his southeast and northeast extractor. While Harassing his economy I hastenly build Hand of Ruk (HOR) Epic Unit. After 5 min, I brought my HOR to near his place for penetrate his strong defense with HOR long range nuke. Guess what, my enemy also finished training alpha. My nuke land first at alpha but it barely reduce alpha hitpoint, i got panic and send all my unit to attack his alpha and then his alpha overwhelm my army within second. So I extend my vision with stratus and eject beacon to enemy headquarter, I give up to fight head on with his alpha directly so I change my focus to his headquarter. I command HOR to attack his headquater(HQ) while running from his alpha (circulate his cliff base). I managed to destroy his HQ inside his base, his alpha stop chasing me and directly go to my base. I managed to destroy his alpha with HOR using hit n run strategy. And what left is destroy all his remaining structure. My first win unranked matchmaking.   MY CONCLUSION ABOUT THIS GAME :   This game have a big potential to expand and become more polish infuture. Don't get me wrong this game have more merit than demerit. It have weakness and stregth. For me this game is perfectly fine and it need more content to play such as arcade mode feature based on starcraft 2. I highly reccomended to play this game for all who suck at APM and noob like me. This game is likely target to the customer whose want slow paced action casual gameplay. I give 9/10 Mark",

You will listen to the menu theme infinitely while you read the wiki tutotial pages. It gets repetitive :( -Units look too similar. -The UI and font are very small especially if you are on a laptop.  -The UI is dota/LoL based in the sense that QWERT are shortcuts for buildings and units. -Until you set up the game to fit your pc/laptop specs the game will load a minimum of 2 minutes before every match. -No tactical consumables such as: air strike, paratroopers, map reveal, etc.  Things I am no sure how I feel about: *There is a fixed population cap *floating resource cap *Game is very serious *Beta are butt ugly  Things I enjoy: +Made by the Westwood guys +Frank made the OST +Epic units are hard to make +Factions are more diverse than RA3 and CnC4 +Tech upgrades limits your playstyle  In conclusion: It's not as flashy as Red Alert3 or Tiberium Wars. Maybe if I played strategy games other than Red Alert2/3 and Tiberium Wars/Kane's Wrath, I would say that the game has a high skill ceiling. I wish it wasn't so demanding.",

I dont write reviews much but there is a diamond in the rough if the devs could see the potential.  Slow paced RTS, computer on easy will knok on your front door before your base gets structured enough to defend yourself (like a zerg rush but with guns) once you kill 1 there will be another to follow within 5 to 10 sec.   Not an intuitave game and the base structure is simplistic which leavs me the feeling that I only have a few options making a skirmish feel like a pre written war novel...long, painful and everyone dies.  Pros; Great grapics Creative races Story mode (Did'nt get enough time to explore it much) Fluid framerate (even at 4x superscale)  Cons: Slow inital base developement  Weak base (lowest rung) fighters that take way to long to build/create. In SC a zerg rush can be stopped by marines or protoss infantry if played correctly   Game Mechanics - for being a simple tree structure It was too difficult to well develope your army (balancing of time/resources required)  Balancing - While the idea was creative and interesting It really makes the impression that the focus was put into the story rather than the skirmishes. If you want a RTS to live forever (like SC original) make the multiplayer aspect shine. No one plays the story for years and years. if this game was built around a multiplayer community that could mod and contribute to the final product then even with the flaws mentioned above it would go toe to toe with the best of the best because the gamers would be driving the game aspects not just reading it page after painful page.  Bottom Line:  I won't pay for it untill it gets a community driven feel. cheapen and hasten lowest rung fighters to allow for epic infantry battles that start early and persist untill you develope higher teir fighters (cost of lowest teir should be less than 1/2 that of the next highest). Simple base structures should be quicker and use less resources to make. bigger maps with community developed maps supported. dedicated customizeable servers with an ingame browser would get the community to a religious following.

Humanity, The Beta, and the Goo. 2.) The Story is well thought out, with bits of backstory that really add to the experience. It leave me wanting more. I really hope there will be a sequel. 3.) Mutliplayer is fun and fast paced. Not for people who want to turtle or play defensive games however. Expect most matches to end within 30-45 minutes, or possibly faster. 4.) It's an RTS in an era that has forgotten this once great genre. I love supporting anyone willing to make a AAA RTS.  It's not without it's issues however. The Multiplayer is very limited, just 1v1 or 2v2. The reason for this given by the developer is performance, which I can believe. However, I'd rather the developer just leave multiplayer open for the future, when more players have hardware capable of running the game well. I believe this is the chief reason for the game not being more successful than it is.  Cons:   1.) Only 1v1 or 2v2. This limits the appeal of the multiplayer greatly. I really hope the dev opens up 3v3 and 4v4. 2.) Micromanagement can be excessive. This is really a problem with most RTS games however. 3.) Late game is dominated by high end units, like Epic units and heavy tank units. This tends to also be a weakness in RTS games. I would like to see tech 1 units stay useful in late game. 4.) Story ends on a cliffhanger... I'm afraid that I won't get the whole story if we don't get a sequel.  Overall, I really like this game and want more. It's easily accessible to Starcraft 2 and Command and Conquer fans, and has as enjoyable a story as SC2.  8.5/10. 9/10 if you don't care about 3v3 and 4v4 multiplayer.",

BASE BUILDING Each race has it's own unique building format allowing for a completely dfferent play style in base building, be it dispersed, centralised or deadly mobile baby belching carnage.  UNITS The one down fall this game may have is it's units diversity. Each race can build a max of 200 and although each unit may look different each approach is very similar, you have several sets of upgradable abilities that are revesable / interchangable. In this game no unit has it's own micromanagement bar the epic, it comes down to your ability to control the sway of war not how quick you can bash a spell button.  MAP EDITOR The map editor is second to none, this is where the game really shines. Build the ultimate skirmish map or even deisgn your own campaign with almost no limits. Such a varied and vibrant world, you can even import your own prefabs and textures and dish out a decent set of instructions to your AI factions. though the editor does not come without a few minor bugs., well... just.

I have heard it was randomly crashing though from what i read grey goo has been fixing/fixed the issue, they run tournaments for cash say $75000 to win? so issues can't be to prolific. The fan base is growing so you should expect more and more to log in for war, at present the online number can be a little low from what i hear.

Some of them were simple some complex and i understand that not every single game need to be the same.   That's why whe ni saw Grey Goo i decided to buy it to get classic RTS like Command &amp; Conquer series and that's what i'v got!   Most of negative reviews dont understand that not every RTS must be Total War etc. There is place for games where you just build/train/destroy without xx upgrades and asian micro (Starcraft way). Not everyone want to play pressing 10 buttons same time and keep everything in control for every second of game just because if not then you lose.  So keeping that in mind Grey Goo is superb RTS with nice graphic and sound (first game where i didnt turned off music) where you can just fight with enemy without thinking how many units every type you must have or you lose (in Starcraft every single unit count - here not)  But there are some problems so far - mostly with multiplayer because they have region lock and it's hard to find anyone to play with.  +Game style +Graphic +Music +Races playing different ways +Campaign hard and with proper plot  -At this point multiplayer with lack of players (region lock) and maps/modes  I would be glad to get some DLC with more few more units (might be crazy things like Tanya in RA ;) )",

I'm running on a GeForce GTX 860m Asus Laptop and now playing on HIGH graphics/full resolution 1920 settings with no framerate or lag issues.   If you are having these problems and you have a NVIDIA card.. go to your Geforce Control Panel and manage 3D settings. Change your preferred graphics processor to High-Performance NVIDIA processor, and go to the Adjust image settings with preview... and select Let the 3D application decide.

            "review_text": "Let me first say that I *cautiously* recommend this game. What I mean by that is that I *don't* recommend this game to a wide number of people, but I believe there is a subset of players that will enjoy what Grey Goo offers.  Grey Goo is somewhat a return-to-form for some of the former Westwood team (Command and Conquer series), and that's very apparent here. The build, repair, sell systems bring back fond memories for me of eveything from Tiberian sun to RA3. The factions follow a lot of industry standards. Firstly, there's three of them. Second, one is very technologically advanced (ironically the Humans in this case), another is more rough-and-tumble (Beta), and the last is a force of pure destruction seemingly without conscience (Goo). See also: Protoss, Human, Zerg - or the equivalent in most other RTS games. That said, there are distinctions which make all three interesting - and the Goo provide a new sort of challenge because of their mobility. Possibly a challenge which still hasn't been properly balanced, depending on whom you ask.  Performance-wise, Grey Goo (at present) is merely acceptable. A lingering issue since launch relates to stutters and the inevitable slowdown that usually occurs 10 minutes into a match. I'm talking the difference between 90fps at the start and 20fps by the end of a match. This seems to be more an issue in multiplayer/skirmish than it is in the campaign. The devs have promised this will be addressed in the next major patch within a week or two. For reference, I played the game on a GTX 760 with an i5 4690k, but users on both sides of the spectrum from my hardware have confirmed the same issue.  As for the singleplayer, WETA's influence with character design is one of the stronger points. The storyline is certainly serviceable but likely won't surprise too much. Difficulty was recently more-evenly balanced than launch. Previously the game proved quite challenging even on the easiest settings.  The long-short: If you're looking for a new RTS and don't mind the above-listed flaws, Grey Goo is a game from a talented team that may be worth your time. There's a lot of love here, to be certain; it's just too bad it wasn't more fully-realized at launch. If, on the other hand, you're looking for the next competitive RTS, this likely won't fit the bill. The community is small at present - though most are very nice. It's hard to say what (if anything) the devs will do to promote the game going forward, but I'd be very surprised to see it suddenly become an eSports sensation. Still, I enjoyed my 51 hours with Grey Goo.",

Also, units do not have special activatable abilities, like they do in most other modern RTS games. While some people seem to prefer the extra layer of unit type micromanagment, I do not. So this is a plus for players like me.   The plot starts to get exciting right around when the Campaign ends, so there is definitely room for some DLC/Expansion to keep things moving along.

            "review_text": "Grey Goo is a very traditional RTS. No hero units or unit leveling of any kind, minimal unit micro-management, a reasonably high unit cap and proper base building. It is also rather slow paced compared to the likes of Starcraft II.  The production values are suprisingly high. Music and audio are great and campaign cutscenes are very impressive. Maps themselves are quite beautiful as well, even if most of the units and buildings look rather bland.  Gameplay itself is very traditional. There's nothing wrong with this really, not every game needs to be super innovative. Especially in a genre which is pretty much dead these days. The game copies the classic Command &amp; Conquer gameplay formula more or less intact.  The game has four playable factions, the Humans, the Beta, the Goo and the Shroud. Humans and beta are very traditional RTS races that play very similarly to each other. The titular Goo, however, are something much more unique.  The Goo don't have a traditional base at all and instead of collecting resources, mother goo units regenerate health while on a resource node. The mother goo can then sacrifice some of its health to create new units. This is certainly the most innovative aspect of the game. Unfortunately this also leads to some tedious micro-management and I wasn't personally a big fan of the playstyle.  The shroud were not part of the original game and were added in a later patch. They only appear as an enemy in a bonus campaign mission and are also available for skirmish and multiplayer games. I didn't end up seeing enough of them to get a good feel of how they play.  For the most part the unit design is quite boring for all factions, both visually and ability-wise. The ultimate Epic units are a lot more exciting, but they take a long time and lot of resources to build and you generally use only one per map.  The user interface is for the most part quite decent and pretty much what you would except in an RTS. All the usual hotkeys are there and the controls work the way you expect them to. It's missing a few of the more advanced features, but overall the UI is decent enough.  The campaign itself is passable but again nothing spectacular. The story is quite forgettable. Surely the titular grey goo (aka runaway self-replicating nanobots) could have been used to tell a more interesting story. Missions themselves are pretty standard fare for the most part, even if some of the missions spice up things a little bit. Personally I found the campaign difficulty surprisingly high. Usually I play single-player RTS games on hard, but after the first few missions I decided to switch to normal. Part of this difficulty does come from bad mission design, however, as a lot of missions have enemy units spawning from thin air.  Personally I find Grey Goo rather hard to recommend unless you are a big RTS fan looking for a new game to play. There's nothing really wrong with the game but despite the high production values it suffers from some bland design and doesn't bring anything new to the genre. Best to wait for a sale or a bundle with this one.  I played through the main campaign on normal and also finished the Emergence DLC mini-campaign. I also played a couple skirmish games against the AI. I don't normally play multiplayer with strangers, so I skipped that part of the game.  The good: - Solid old-school RTS gameplay - Beautiful cut-scenes - Great music by Frank Klepacki (of C&amp;C fame)  The bad: - Visual design of the units and buildings is rather bland - Some issues with unit balance - Some annoying campaign missions - Forgettable story - Goo faction is interesting but ultimately not that fun to play - Map visuals can be somewhat confusing at times and it's hard to tell what's passable terrain and what's not - Very strict line of sight rules are too easy to exploit  The ugly: - Performance could be better - Saving and especially loading take a very long time",

However, we play Real Time Strategy games nowadays for the multiplayer, which Grey Goo has of course.  A shame then, that the multiplayer portion of Grey Goo is now essentially dead. It started out with a player-base of about 2750 people worldwide on launch. The current average player-base at peak times is now around 70.. 'worldwide'.  That combined with some MAJOR issues, like the dev's inability to fix multiplayer lag ( which is probably one of the reasons all of the players left ), The crazy price tag ( I mean, I've got 70 hours on record, and I still think it cost too much ) Like, the only other RTS at that price is Starcraft 2.... obviously not going to get grey goo over a storied well looked after series like starcraft for obvious consumer reasons.  Other things like lack of maps ( More are comming aparently ), No replays ( which is being added, aparently ), bad unit balance (as in with one Race, you can win by just spamming the same 2 Tier 1 units, since AOE just cant handle them anymore after the latest 'balance update' ) bad tech balance, for example free repairing of expensive aircraft, or extra harvestor armour, or extractor armour... the armour thing should be combined, with one choice being something completely different from the armour and aircraft repair, its an obvious choice every time.  I want to love this game so much, but because of the non-existant player-base and some of the more aformentioned issues, I just cant. I mean, the game is a good as dead, the dev's might as well stop updating and make Grey Goo 2 or something.  A sad 'Unable to Recommend' from me.",

            "review_text": "I picked this up during the summer steam sale and while it does have some nice qualities, overall I feel it is lacking in depth, expected RTS features, and overall seems a bit risk averse to give it staying power. I did have some fun going through some matches, but ultimately don't anticipate this will remain in my library for long. Specifics thoughts:  -Nice keyboard shortcut scheme. You select the building or unit type with QWER+ and then it brings up a new set of choices, again QWER+ and then a final menu. So, if you need a certain unit you very quickly realize you can do EQQ or whatever... but, the game does lack some expected commands. Can't pause at any point or change the game speed, no select all units, couldn't figure out how to bring up FPS, etc.   -Has a neat cover system where you can hide in a forest and fire from it w/o being targeted... but, there's few areas on the maps and they are too large. They should've been more liberal with the placement of cover and included some smaller one-unit areas. Some other games I can recall have done this maybe a bit better.   -The two human/alien races are a bit too similar. Props to them for making the Goo race work very differently, though. I feel they put all their risk in this one race and played the rest of the game too conservatively.   -The units within those races are a bit too similar. For example, it's very obvious in a game like StarCraft how a marine, siege tank, and hellion are different. No questions about strengths and even confusing unit types. In this game, the units tend to run together once in a category. There are a few exceptions, air units and artillery are definitely different, but I found the units overall a bit bland.   -The tech is pretty cool. You have 4 tech choices each with 3 options. Once you commit to an option within those choices (eg, Tech granting Anti-Air unit ground attacks as well) you can't pick the other 2. Was easy enough to manage from the interface and understand what each bonus was. I tended to pick the same bonuses game to game, unsure if that was play style or simply balance problems but would have to play more to know for sure.   -Framerate / slowdowns - Toward the end of a longer game, the game 'stutters' while trying to compensate for what I think is low framerates (can't pull it up to determine, though). Could be network? Hard to say what it was, but I've got a solid connection and a solid i7 w/ GTX 960 and graphics actually mostly turned down.   -Building placement all have to be part of your initial set of root structures (either your HQ or hubs if you're playing Beta). They went for a smaller singular base as a game decision, okay that works. However, it is not elegantly done. Some of the ways attachments work early on (you have to attach a Tank module to a factory to allow you to build tanks) make it easy for new players to make mistakes and build useless modules. In addition, it was a bit buggy when selling structures, I'd sometimes cut power off to half my base. Okay, that's a feature, let me rebuild it to connect power again. Nope. Guess it is a bug, but ran into a few times where visually I should have power but half my buildings wouldn't.   All in all, for a 60% off steam sale this reminded me of the heyday of RTS fifteen years ago where I'd pick up a new game in the summer and nine out of ten times would see it fall flat, just as this one has.

I mean exactly the same, a light unit, an anti armour unit, a tank, an artililary, an anti air and a couple of aircraft.  Combat is dull, there are no melee units, no fast units. Air get destroyed by anti air, to the point where they are unusable.  The game is slow, units take forever to build and forever to move. Feels like you wait alot.  There is little micro, the simplicity of the units seems to be designed to remove the micro from the game.  Building is clunky (appart from the goo), for some reason things keep needing to be attached to other things. For example, humans have one core base, then every other builing needs to be connected by a pipe to the main base building. The pipe is weak and fustrating to place and should there ever be a gap in the pipe everything downstream stop s working. (you can't place buildings out of LOS). (Note humans can't build a second main base, so good luck building over to the next resource patch, 'enjoy' that frustration)  This is nothing like starcraft, i would say it is closer to total ana.

The Goo are also the worst RTS faction i have ever played, they're supposed to be mobile and massing, except imagine having all of your production facilities spread all over the map with no way to rally troops forcing you to click each individual mother goo (production unit) to spawn a small or large blob which then can be transformed into your units, small blob for basic, big blob for more advanced units, and they have 0 aircraft units and every unit is slow as balls.  Beta and Humans are pretty basic designs, Beta have outposts that range from small to large and buildings have to be placed next to them to gain power and function with their main defense being emplacing troops on walls, humans build powerlines allowing them to extend their infrastructure to their boundries to build turrets, units are your standard stuff infantry then up to tanks then aircraft and your Ultimate units, both play roughly the same.  The only thing that really stands out in this game are the cutscenes, where they clearly spent the vast majority of their funds, each mission before and after has a cutscene which are top notch, sadly the story on the whole is kinda bad or rather its not horrible but its left terribly incomplete and considering they're releasing DLC, which i'm not paying for 3 missions i can only imagine they'll want to milk people for more money to get the rest, not sure why anyone in their right mind would do that though.  TLDR- The game is slow and clunky, the Goo is the worst faction i've played, the Campaign is insanely short 7.8 hours for me to finish, the Units are uninspired, and the only good thing about it is the cutscenes and story which is left completely unfinished.

The Ffactions are unique enough from one another, they build completely different, distinct looks, etc. and the game is quite beautiful graphically. Sadly that's the only good thing I have to say, since the game seems to push you to be a fast and aggressive player which I generally tend to play as a turtle. There's basically no base expansion aside from resource gathering and finding a big enough space so you can build your war factory and attached all the neccesary bits to it so you can produce everything. Resources are slow and limited, which adds to not being able to expand much.   To me it seems this game was designed around the idea of quick, simple RTS games with others in online multiplayer, and to that effect a lot of the driving content, such as diverse units, structures and the ability to not only push your army forward but your base forward as well, is not present.

Maybe I'm just not liking the starting race in the campaign, but the tech progression is a bit wonky and the tutorial is clear as mud. Seems like the only way to get anywhere is by tank rushing over and over and over and over while the enemy tank rushes you over and over and over and over. Your troops move with all the intelligence they did in Warcraft I. I guess the focus is on macro instead of micro management, but I just can't click with it. I'm sad, because the cutscenes are a great throwback to RTS games of old. I'll keep trying.",

With that being said, I can not recommend the game at it's current price of $50. There are 3 factions, each very unique. There is a decent amount of units, and the game feels fairly balanced. The main con to me is that its just not very exciting. I'm not one to normally gripe about graphics, but the battle animations are boring. Theres no cool explosions, no cool unit movements, etc. I have not played enough of the game to make the following assumption, but I have a feeling that the only thing it takes to win a battle of Grey Goo is having a higher number of units, and not necessarily a batter strategy. For that reason, and for the $50 price tag, I do not recommend the game. Wait for the price to go down. Check out Supreme Commander 1, Supreme Commander 2 as other options for now.",

In its current state, it's a messy game in which I keep forgetting it's not in the Alpha stage. This is a full release. Lot's of mistakes made, too many to list here. Biggest complaint overall is there's no sense of 'choice' when you play. The units are so categorized it's either you build them or you lose. The strategy is written for you. It's a matter of how competent you are of the rules and if the clunkiness of the units pathfinding and fighting goes in your favor.",
