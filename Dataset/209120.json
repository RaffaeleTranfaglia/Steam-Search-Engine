            "review_text": "This game isn't that bad but I feel there are better fighter games out there. The combo system feels limited. You can mix between punches and kicks and up in strength Light &gt; Medium &gt; Heavy for 3 attacks, then a 'Launch'. Then a bunch of single special moves, and then 2 throws (forward and back throw). Theres also these quick combos you activate with just 2 buttons if you have enough energy, you can set 2 different pre-made combos from a list of like 6 in the menu.  So overall I feel its not fluid combo system. The game is also so fast it seems like you need to input all your buttons before hes even done with the first swing. Naturally I feel like I want to pause for the attack animation to finish before I input another button into the combo but instead you need to push them all as fast as possible. Also things like countering a throw with a throw seem crazy hard considering how fast the game is going.  The AI on some charecters on arcade seem better then others. Like the Guile &amp; Abel team. Guile throws sonic booms, waits for you to get in range and tears you up. Abel just walks endlessly at you and leaves himself open for medium hits. That was the worst team I noticed but I havn't faced them all yet.   The graphics, audio and charecter models are really good. Bryan, Hwoarang, Dalsim, Yoshimitsu, King look amazing. Bryan acting like a complete sciopath I find kinda weird. But then Law, Blanka, Paul, and somewhat Guile for exmaple look like they came from some bizzaro cartoon world. The rest are pretty good.  The Gem system is kinda cool as you can customize your charecter slightly before you go into a fight. I don't like how the better gems and combos can only be gotten by the DLC. I hate DLC, they should just update you that content for already buying the game.  I am a Tekken fan and this game doesn't bring a lot of Tekken to the table. Overall it would be great to play on versus with someone at your house or at a party but in general I wouldn't get it unless it was on sale for atleast 50%.  Lasty I get a constant screen tearing line across the middle whie I play, It gets pretty annoying. My fps is always stuck at around 60 even with Vsync off; the ingame benchmark runs at 300+ fps but normal gameplay is always 60. Vsync, Fixed/Variable framerate, Single gpu mode, nothing gets rid of the line.",

            "review_text": "Ok lets get something straight here people. Yes GFWL, shut down making it almost impossible or work heavy just to get the game back and running again. BUT, that doesn't mean it didn't have potential beforehand or it 'sucked' all because it had GFWL running.   Before the GFWL Shutdown: - Great gameplay - Amazing graphics - Real simple controls although yes more SF oriented controls than Tekken - Awesome DLCs and great storylines - Really gets you going sometimes - Fun for everyone else in the family who loves SF and Tekken  After the GFWL Shutdown: - You can't say anything really after this incident - The game doesn't work for DLCs or any pack after this occured - Only worth playing for Offline ( as in against someone in your house ) not multiplayer - A lot of work just to try and get it working  Sum up: Not like it didn't have potential, it had everything going for it and good gameplay/graphics just as I mentioned before, but do not and I repeat do not hate on this game just because GFWL closed down on it. Now yes I do recommend not buying it unless you don't mind the simple characters already given to you and playing with a friend or family member in the household, and the time consuming process of just getting it to work with GFWL Marketplace version. If you want to hate on something hate on the GFWL services, but not the game people. Learn from what's really causing it and not hating on the game itself cause of something else. If there was a 'Somewhat or Maybe' button for 'Do you recommend this game?' then I would've chosen that.",

It's a decent game but has bad netcode if you want to play online, not to mention that you have to use Games for Windows Live if you want to play it. That app is dying though, so perhaps those problems will be solved when it rightfully craps out. If you want it for single player, I can fully recommend it though. As with all fighting games, make sure you have a game pad. Compared to Street Fighter 4, I pefer this, it just feels better made and the AI doesn't out and out spam you with cheap attacks all the time. 6/10 is my score. It's a competant Street Fighter game - a game which I think that I may be outgrowing because nothing ever changes, nor can it without ruining anything. The Tekken characters have simplified moves to fit with the aging franchise of SF, which may annoy Tekken players out there.",

            "review_text": "I was fortunate enough to pick this up during the holiday sale. My only real gripes with this game is that there's not enough people playing it (mostly because of Capcom's unscrupulous, money-grubbing DLC practices) and that there's no Pac-Man and Mega Man in the DLC pack like in the console versions of the game.  Unfortunately, after the holiday special, this game went right back to being ridiculously overpriced. However, if you happen to have disposable income or this game finds itself on sale again, I would definitely recommend checking it out.",
