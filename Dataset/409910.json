            "review_text": "So where to start. If you like turn based strategy games in fantasy settings then this could be for you. I see some negative postings and the ones that I read seem to buy games and expect to not have to think. The guy that says that you can't save at anytime - yes you can unless you're in ironman mode, so you played ironman and couldn't save go figure. The guy with disappearing troops - if you give them town assignments some last more than a day, again go figure.  Ok I bought the game based on the review by Cablenexus which really made me curious. Mine will be much shorter as I'm not a great writer.  Pros - The difficulty will scale with your group. No easy ride here. Lots of surprises all through it all the way to the final fight which will test what you've learned. Many classes and a few races, many skills so 2 characters of the same class can be played totally differently with a different skill set. Different skills for different races too, a dwarf warrior will vary greatly from a human, dwarf priest and human will have totally different types of healing. Gear auto upgrades when you get something better, no packs full of gear, gear is rare unless you buy it which you won't because your gold will go to your men and skills. I liked that it wasn't some 8-10 hour play through. I had to restart twice early on because of major mistakes, part of the learning process, but I'd say I probably played 20 hours on my full play through, on EASY. The game is tuff, I played a few hours on normal and my graveyard was filling fast so I went easy which I found enjoyably but not easy. You might think that it is but it ramps up fast after about level 3.. ok other pros - random stuff - like if you help a guy one time that you meet on patrol and he gives you some cash, if you get the same encounter again maybe he attacks you and stuff like that. The story telling is good and the voiceover is done well, but I'll mention it in cons too. The dev is actively updating it too. I didn't encounter a single bug in my 27 hours.  Cons - It can seem very repetitive. There is no autofight so even if you know that you've got a fight won you'll need to fight it until the finish. The voiceover is done very well as I said above but it's used too often, he doesn't need to say something for every hit. You need a in game manual if there isn't one, I didn't notice it so that's why I mention it. Graphics are ok, not the best but it's a one man team and they're decent but those of you that only like the ultimate graphics will not like it.  Suggestions - add more, more of everything. More classes, gear, races, buildings in town, gear, write more quests to help with the feeling of repeating things, more unique encounter areas - you have more than I expected but more would be better, more different looks for the characters, more of everything.. Keep doing what you're doing. Oh achievements and cards are always cool too. Good work Markus.  Ok so basically I don't think that it'll be for everyone but I enjoyed it and I'm happy with it - I paid full price too. I think it's a great little game with loads of potential to be even better. If you like the type of game and look at the screenshot's and videos and it looks good to you then give it a try. I found it addicting and I'll replay it too as it'll never be the same twice with different heroes, skills, etc.",

            "review_text": "Quite a nice turn-based party-based game with a light management part. Each class has its own gameplay and party combinations are quite important. I have only played on Normal difficulty and it is a nice challenge already. One more plus: The dev is still adding stuff and squashing rare bugs. I wish there were more text based events and/or random outcomes for each possible decision. Expect to either lose some units or use the Retreat mechanic in some cases. Overall, i like The Storm Guard and hope the dev will keep at it for a while more. I'll be looking at his future project as well if he decides to go for a sequel/DLC/new turn-based game.",

I've spent way to much money feeding my gaming habit only to be dissapointed so it's a real treat when I stumble upon a title like this one.   Reminds me a bit of the older RPG's from my Amiga days and really has that 'one more turn' feel going for it. Bit rough around the edges but at the same time some really nice creature models. Very impressive for a one man show and I whole heartedly give my recommedation.   *To the dev, in the off chance you see this, you have made a fan and I look forward to your future endeavors!",
