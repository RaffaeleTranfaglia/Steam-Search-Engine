I just tried it and their is no immersive video capability or recording the full scene. During playback in the Vive, the scene that the user sees is stuck looking where ever the player was looking during the recording. I was recording Panoptic, which would have been a perfect option for recording the immerisve or full scene view for someone to look around the recorded view however they chose when viewing the recording.  Is there something we are missing in settings that should alow the playback to be similar to a 360 video on youtube?",
