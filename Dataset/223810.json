    "description": "Long, long ago, there was an ancient kingdom called Ys which prospered under the auspices of two heavenly Goddesses. Over time, the kingdom came to be known as Esteria, and its divine history was largely forgotten by all but the descendants of those who once preached the Goddesses’ will.",

            "review_text": "Even on the easiest level of the game - it still has a high level of challenge and difficultly but the way you attack enemies is different - you must bump into them. A plus is that you can recover HP if you are standing still in most places. If you are familiar with Y's Book 1 and 2 on PC Engine, you have a pretty good feel for this story , however some elements have been reworked to provide an element of challenge in order to advance to specific portions of the game. Some early bosses - You will find out quickly that you have to level up so high in order to beat them. That may take a long time but in the end, your Gold Level will rise high and you can buy some of the more expensive items from the get go.   Another plus of this game is the choice of soundtrack. You have Chronicles, Complete and PC-88 to choose from. For nostalgic purposes I turn it on PC - 88 because I love the retro music.   Being that I own Y's Oath in Felghana and Y's Origin , I had to play this. I had realized that this was also released on PSP but never owned a PSP.   Beginners and seasoned Y's players will find a variety of stuff to do in both of these games and its a bargain for the price that was paid for the game. You don't see quality console RPG Games like this on PC that much.",

            "review_text": "Whereas games like Super Mario Brothers complicated gameplay by requiring you to jump atop the heads of foes, Ys requires that you merely bump into them, and it is wonderful!  For a game that can be played largely by only ever touching the directional pad and using a few buttons to navigate menus, I found the gameplay to be incredibly enjoyable. It's a top down adventure RPG, with elements of Metroidvania - lots of backtracking and puzzle solving, finding items, finding uses for items that open new paths. Plenty of NPCs to talk to. The game manages to make some challenging boss fights with incredibly simple mechanics.  The visual style is incredibly pleasing to look at, the music was beyond surprising - it sounds almost piece for piece like something from Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, and the pace of the music suits the breezy combat well!   All in all, I wasn't expecting to even play the game - I picked it up incredibly cheap off a Steam sale. Instead, I've been incredibly surprised with a delightful game with superb presentation and classic gameplay that left me with nothing but good feelings. And I've only finished Ys 1, the first game of the pack.",

Yukihiro Jindo's arrangement of Yuzo Koshiro's music is faithful and as memorable as the original -- as an added bonus, you can enjoy Koshiro's original compositions too! Combat is interesting, as you must hit enemies off-center in order to do damage to them, which leads to some fast frantic gameplay where you also never stop moving, and versus many bosses, its pretty easy to die.   Overall, its hard not to recommend this game. These remakes serve as the start for anyone to get into the Ys series.",

After the Sega Master System and Turbo Grafx-16 versions, this is the third version of Ys I I've played.

First though, the things the two games have in common, like the combat system, which to some may be a turn-off since it uses the 'bump' system to attack rather than the traditional 'push button to attack'. Personally I didn't find it to be a problem - in fact, it makes the game even more action-packed this way. The two games also sport absolutely phenomenal music - some of the best I've ever heard. Ys I though is very archaic in its design - it's easy to get lost, and the game doesn't give you enough clues to tell you what to do next. The map is confusing. The game also doesn't have much variety - just ram into enemies and talk to villagers. Ys II, on the other hand, corrects all the problems of Ys I. The inclusion of magic makes the combat significantly more fun, and the game now has a ton of variety of scenarios - my favorite is disguising as Roos. Ys II is just pure, unadulterated fun. Ys I - 6/10, Ys II - 9/10.",

The music, originally written by Yuzo Koshiro, is amazing as expected from Falcom and you can switch between three different versions of the soundtrack:  1. The original PC-88 version 2. The Complete version, which is a somewhat enhanced version of the PC-88 soundtrack 3. The Chronicles version, which is played live with actual instruments and not FM-synthesized like the previous two  In short, get this game. In case this game is too old-school for you or you want a more modern Ys game, check out Ys Oath in Felghana or Ys Orgins. Both of them are on Steam.",

Ys II has improved a lot, max level is 55, the bump system received a little boost and guess what, now you can use magic! Regarding the difficulty, even though I played both games on Nightmare, I haven't found many difficulties throughout the game, so I think Ys Origin and The Oath in Felghana much more challenging than Ys I &amp; II. Some achievements are very funny to accomplish and some are kinda... weird... Just tell me another game that you can get the 'measures' of a girl in a creepy corner of a dungeon? LOL. What about the soundtrack? Ahh, the soundtrack! It's great as always. I loved it so much! And if you enjoyed Ys Origin's story, you'll enjoy Ys I &amp; II story as well.  So, I highly recommend all Ys games. It's a shame that this franchise is not as popular as it deserved to be.",

While the first game is 5 hours long, the second one will take you around 8-13 hours to beat.   Audio: If you don't like Yuzo Koshiro for some odd reason, then you shouldn't get this game. You'll hear classical pieces, and then some heavy rock sounds with the coolest solos in a rpg game. The music likes to let you know that you're a badass who just can just kill anything if you run into them.   Graphics: It's a 2d sprite based game, with a bit of 3d objects into the mix. While it doesn't really matter, enemies and characters look well in 16-bit sprites. Plus, Lilia and Feena are hot so points to them too.  Gameplay: You just run into things for the first game, and in the second game, you can use magic while running into things to kill bosses and monsters ( Fire is OP though ). There's a small mix of puzzles but you backtrack to places which can be repeitive sometimes. Dungeons are pretty big, and you can get lost ( I did too ) but it's not so bad.  Replayability: I wouldn't replay the game unless you're doing achivements honestly. There's Time Attack which is essentially boss rush.  Falcom, you got me hooked onto the Ys series.

There are some elements of the games that haven't aged well, notably some inscrutable puzzles (save yourself hours of confusion and just look at a guide once you get the hammer in Ys I), mandatory level grinding, and plenty of backtracking through large, mazelike dungeons. That said, these are still charming action RPGs with a fun and unique battle system, well-designed bosses, and what are still some of the best soundtracks in the history of video games—and you get three versions of them!  Ys I &amp; II Chronicles is too similar to earlier versions of the games for me to highly recommend it to people who have already played them, yet different enough that I can't quite call it the definitive version. If you have a Wii, you might want to download the Turbo CD version (Ys Book I &amp; II) instead—it was one of the earliest CD games and is really interesting from a historical perspective.

It's not a combat system that you would find in modern games today, which is kinda sad, since it works extremely well in a 2D, top-down view game.  It's a fairly simple system. If you hit an enemy, you damage the enemy. If you hit it face-on, you'll take damage, but hit it in the side or from an angle and you can easily melt every normal enemy in the game without ever taking damage.  It's fast, fun and fluid. The controls are responsive and the hit detection is very good.  The music, as for every Ys game, is absolutely kick-♥♥♥  Ys I is fairly short, but it's a great build-up for Ys II which is even better than Ys I.   I'd recommend this to everyone who's looking for a fastpaced action game, with a few RPG elements in it. Do keep in mind that the game isn't, of course, for everyone. If you can't tolerate the bumper cars, this simply isn't the game for you.  But in my opinion you'd be missing out as I find it very fun and the satisfaction of beating a boss, to a kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack, is amazing.",

The bump system is the games battle system (obviously) The way it works is you have a few options on attack your monsters. you can attack the side of the monster or the back of it. But never ever ! attack the front of the monster. It actually makes for some good stadegy to involved with the game. you have to watch the monsters movement patterns to see what they do before you go in for the attack.   Sound  Obviously the ost will show some age but it really does sound amazing some people like to mod the game to play the newer version of the soundtrack but play it with the older vesion of the sound track first .

            "review_text": "YS I &amp; II Chronicles are oldschool, revamped games updated from the original games made about 20 years or so ago. I never played the originals but I remember reading about them in gaming magazines and had some brief experience with one of them on the Super Nintendo so long ago. Ever since then I've always beeen curious to see what the Ys games are about.  The game is fast paced with a very simple interface. The entire combat system is bump based. Just run into badies and they die. The challenge is that you cannot hit them directly on center or you will take damage. It takes quite a bit of getting used to and you can quickly impale yourself on your enemies sword on Nightmare difficulty. The music is just as energetic as the gameplay and keeps you moving along. The xp system like all xp systems allows you to grind but you'll find no need to do so. The character seems to level fast enough without the need to spend extra time smashing bad guys for no reason. Which you'll probably do anyway because why not tackle everything in sight?!  The story is fairly short and seems oddly familiar like most games of its era. For some this may be disapointing. I honestly enjoyed playing through the game with it's clear story that stays on track. So many JRPGs of late take steps way out into the realm of crazy and confusing. This game keeps it simple. By the end I was satisfied but don't expect to spend countless hours in this game because it has no side quests or objectives at all.  Final Verdict: Neutral  Buy this game if you're a fan of Ys and like short games. Avoid if you've got better things to do.",

The later Ys games play like a combination of Zelda with Diablo, or some other action-adventure RPG. These remakes of the first two are a bit different, with combat being based on the 'bump' system, where enemies take damage when you run into them (though you'll take damage too if you run into them head-on). The plots are pretty much excuses for you to explore dungeons full of enemies and take artifacts, but the gameplay itself is quite fun.  While I enjoy the later ones more, and there are a few annoying elements that haven't aged terribly well, the games still remain fun, and these remakes tie in together with the remake of Origin (also available on Steam) very nicely. Highly recommended, especially to Zelda fans.",

The improved bump system made the otherwise kinda boring (although creative) fighting system much more interactive. The graphics are heavily improved and the already catchy original music got some incredible remixes that still just feel... right and not unnatural. The difficulty, especially during boss fights, has been slightly altered to adjust to the improved movement range, which, for example, actually made the final boss of Ys I much harder in this version. And yet, with all these additions and changes, it still felt like the old classic.   So, if you like old-school action adventures, you simply can't go wrong with these.

The characters in the game are great and really memorable especially the main character. Another this is the gameplay is a major improvement over Hydlide on the NES, In wich this game was hated by many including famous gamers like the Angry Video Game Nerd and Jared who now has his own YouTube account. The familar battle system goes through where Hydlide went wrong and fixes a whole lot of problems making it as enjoyable as intended. The game rewards you for exploring everthing especially when the game now has achievements. One last thing you will love about them is the great presentation.The games visuals are astounding even when in the animated cutscenes. The music is so beautifully orchestrated, they need their original soundtracks because From the rock songs to Feena's calming theme which is a great example of how great of a job you can do when it comes to classical music, these songs are would be nice to have on your music player. These two games are really great and are not worth missing out on. I am now into the Ys series itself. Now my aims are towards Oath in Felghana and Origins.",

Most important though is that these games are just fun and actually offer a decent challenge for JRPGs.  The port is really good too. There are quite a few lazy console/retro ports on Steam these days, but this isn't one of them. The only minor complaint I have is that there is a separate config application rather than in-game menus for choosing resolution, mapping keys, etc.  On the plus side, this version has some nice features like being able to switch between different versions of the soundtrack (essentially 8-bit, 16-bit, and modern), zoom, scaling, and resolution options, proper gamepad support, and cloud saves. Overall, this is a nice release of some quality classic games.",

I cannot put my finger on exactly what it is, but VERY few games, if any, nail that exact formula today (The most recent I can think of that I played being the first Golden Sun). Despite the limited graphics and simple gameplay, there is just something that makes the stories and characters seem to come to life and the world just call out for every house, forest, cave and secret to be explored. I would be tempted to chock it all up to nostalgia, except that I had never played a single Ys game until recently here on steam. Thus far, I have finished Ys I and cannot wait to move on to II. This game, originally released in the late 80s and updated with beautiful 32-bit style gameplay graphics and hand drawn anime style cut-scenes and character profiles, nails that formula. It's been given a nice new paint job and some optional updated musical scores, but even with all these things the old heart and soul of this classic game still shines through, perhaps all the brighter, and even to a new comer like myself. I am reminded of the first time I played The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (so perhaps there is some form of nostalgia at play here after all).  I was VERY skeptical of the strange 'bump combat' system at first. I still wouldn't say it's ideal. I'm glad it did not become a standard in games, but after spending some time with it, and leveling up a little, it actually is nowhere near as bad as it seems at first and becomes quite enjoyable.  The graphics, artwork (of which you can select 2 versions), and music (of which you can select a few versions) are absolutely beautiful. The characters and dialogue are interesting, fun, and memorable. The story is engaging. The puzzles are fun. The combat can range between frustrating and fun, but isn't bad once you get used to it.  Overall I would recommend this game to just about anyone, but especially to those looking for that missing charm that games once had.",

Then I bought and played Ys Origins and loved it immediately because of the close resembelance of the action RPG meganics that Ys online used. In the mean time I've bought the whole series aside from Ys seven (can grab it for my PSP) and all of them are action RPGs.  Ys I &amp; II are not like the rest of the series at all. These two are more like the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs with a twist. First off, the battle system sucks balls. They prolly thought it was innovative for the time to use a 'bumb' system to attack. This also means that you probably won't be able to use ranged attack (I really can't see why XSEED didn't change the combat system in the 2009 version of the game - there are 2 versions of each game, the old one and the revised one).  Then the story. Most of the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs it takes you about 10-15 minutes to get into the story and you can say if you like it or not. Ys I &amp; II are different there and after half an hour and having spoken to every one in the village you wake up I still had no clue what I was to do, other than just leave town and see where it'll bring me. Truth be told, the main plot was explained, but from there on not the slightest hint of where to go or what to do.  Somehow YS I &amp; II just lack something for me that other NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs had and I definately won't recommend this game to anyone, unless you've played them back in the days and want to play them again.  Before anyone starts ♥♥♥♥♥ing to me about not knowing NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs, I have played (most of them never completed, but that's normal for me) Final Fantasy 1 trhough 4, Star Ocean 1 and willing to play 2, Tales of Phantasia (still ongoing on the PSP, means when I'm traveling).

The difficulty of the bosses at the end will leave you frustrated and looking for strategies. The final boss will frequently kill you in 1 hit.
