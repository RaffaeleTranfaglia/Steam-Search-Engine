            "review_text": "So I'm going to start off by saying I'm not a guy who plays OG arcade ports of these games so I am not going to compare them to that seeing as how it would be freaking impossible for these guys match slowdown from static hardware to that of dynamic hardware.   You ask most people who have bought this game who aren't elitist diehards who own PCBs of the originals and they will tell you that this is an awesome game. And THAT is all you need to know. You have people who don't want others to enjoy a different version of DoDonPachi, because to them it's some kind of sacrilegious act since scores from this version can't be compared to scores from other versions.   I sort of had this mindset with Cave's first release on STEAM with Mushihimesama and I quickly learned to just look at these releases as stand-alones. It causes less stress and it helps me enjoy the game. Cave is releasing these games so that they can hopefully bring in thousands of new fans instead of pleasing a handful of grumpy elitists. They need to continue going this route.   DoDonPachi Resurrection is a fantastic package offering up numerous modes of play that I still need time to explore. Each mode brings different dynamics that require the player to put in more time to master. Patterns are different, ships are different, scoring mechanics are different, speed is different. You're basically getting thousands of dollars of arcade games in one neat bundle for around $26 (during the sale).   You've got fantastic art direction with all the designs of the enemies, backgrounds, player's ships, bullet spreads, sparkly bonus items, and debris/explosion. Every thing is just a joy to behold while playing the game. It's pretty destracting, but in a good way. I'll end up losing concentration and getting destroyed because I just want to take the time and enjoy the hard work that went into creating these wonderful designs.   Music and sound design are also top notch. The music helps me focus while the sounds from attacks and explosions help me feel like I'm an unstoppable force of complete annihilation.   Technically this game does have it's issues in terms of a boss disappearing on stage 5 of BLA and some unwarranted slowdown (this I don't care about because I never played the original releases and could care less). But if you've bought products from Degica before they are quick to release patches. Hell, they've already released 3 patches since the game's release YESTERDAY. Even on just now as of writing this to fix the sound tracks. When you buy from Degica you know you're going to get support for your software. Unlike other companies like Koei Tecmo.   If you're hesitant about buying this game don't be. Don't listen to the elitists. They are just angry people who don't want others to enjoy a different version of their precious games. Hopefully Cave releases something brand new on this platform so they can argue about nothing.",

            "review_text": "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection. I love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter.  That being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.  Still, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty. ",

This is a really good game for newcomers to Bullet Hell games, and especially DoDonPachi games as this is probably the easiest one to beat as a whole, and the easiest one to rack up points in while also being hard to mess up your score in. Don't be mistaken, though, as the later difficulties outside of Novice can be unrelenting, with one of the hardest True Last BOsses in any DDP game.  Highly recommended.",
