Given that it's developed in unity it does have some glitches/problems but that is to be expected other than that it's great, so check this game out if you get the chance!",

I get the appeal to discover and to wander in a beautiful world, like in many other walking simulator games, but it doesn't work when focusing to make the next jump. Not recommended.",

It is supposed to be a platformer, but you can place platforms anywhere you want. Nothing is explained, be it goal or game mechanic. The models are poorly done and clipping is frequent. The registry of level completion is less than par. It is generally unpleasant and confusing. The music, which ranged from classical to borderline dubstep was not at all cohesive and didn't fit with the game.To top it off, the normal WASD move keys were changed to ZASD, with Z being move forward. And worse yet, the game needed to be closed to change it. Lastly, upon exiting the game, I had to go the task manager to end the exe, although I had already hit 'quit game.' I finished it in half an hour, and I will never open it again. All in all, atrocious.",

Each level is unique and for $0.49 during the Winter 2016 Sale, I feel like I got a deal. I played right through, no stopping, and it took me about two hours. I still had time to stop and appreciate the environment as well.  The game is just tragically short. Also, each level plays by a different set of game rules. So some action that will 'kill' you in one level doesn't do it in another level. I also would have liked seamless transitions between levels and the game would have felt completely continuous. However, I could see how people would want to get to a stopping point.",
