            "review_text": "Ahhhh Moment of Silence, does it get anymore mediocre? Released back in 2004 you would swear it was made in 1994. It falls for a lot of the pit falls many 90's point and click adventure games did back in those days(I still loved many) and the graphics are about on par for the era. You will find yourself wondering have I explored this whole area or do I need to attempt to walk off screen in some weird fashion(yes it's one of those)? You will also find yourself at the mercy of multiple illogical or poorly designed puzzles although the game isn't terribly difficult. It is packed with boring dialogue and little action even for an adventure game. The game has a post 9/11 USA feel to it with government so large it is watching everyone all the time. Very Orwellian feeling. I actually did enjoy this aspect of the game and the statement it was trying to make but not enough to forgive its annoyances. Play it if you've already played through all of the great point and clicks but please, dear god, don't make it one of the few you'll ever try. You may find yourself wondering,'I haven't even played through all the Sam and Max franchise what am I doing playing this #$%&amp;!'",
