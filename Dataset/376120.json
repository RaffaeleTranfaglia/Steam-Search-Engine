You will have had enough of it by as the building upgrades times take a turn for a self pondered thought of “what did this game just smoke?” as the building times go from 1 day to 5 days going from level 1 to 2 as you notice out of the corner of your eye the buildings have 20+ levels to them is time to grab a fresh pair before sitting back down again. Then vehicles start to require real money to use them each match or 50 times more to permanently unlock starting at the second medium vehicle of 10 gold or 500 gold respectively after you reach the required level.   Multiplayer is pretty much dead so having to buy single player skirmish tokens is a guaranteed given. Tank ammo is next on the list to ease you into feeding the game real money too as does the base upgrades. So after you play for about 30min to an hour expect to be starting to pump in real money. After 8 hours of play probably around $50 to $100 a day in order to not wait 10 hours to weeks for each vehicle upgrade unlock (plus 5%, 10% or 15% to speed/ armour etc, not to mention what looks like 100 levels of upgrades for each of the 10 or so ammo in each of the I think it was 5 ammo classes so yer there’s that.)",

Now the game will not connect to the server even though steam says that the last time I played was today!! That is 100% false!! This game is not worth it...by one that actually works and has some support. I tried to access support for this issue and have been totally ignored.",
