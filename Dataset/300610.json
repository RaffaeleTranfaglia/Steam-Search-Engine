Camera angles are funky at times, running in full screen on 1080p seems to crash the game (for me at least) I had to launch windowed at 720p then alt+enter to get into full screen. A lot of peole are having network issues, as am I. There is customization, as of now it doesnt seem as exstensive as Pool Nation but this game has a lot that game didnt.  So I recomment the game to the fans of great pool games, just letting it be known at this time it has its issues... but so did Pool Nation on its release.",

UPDATE: 'admitted that many users were getting paired up with A.I. rather than a live human opponent.'   Apparently multiplayer is nottt working.   Update 2: No idea what's working or isn't. different platforms having issues with multiplayer.   a confused 2/5?  Update 3: Multiplayer a guessing game.   'VooFoo Studios Hi Adam, if the server hasn't found a player within 10 seconds you get paired up with a DNA player. In the upcoming update, you will be asked if you want to play a DNA player. If you say no, it will continue searching for a human player. Hope this helps!'  a slightly more straightforward 1/5",

            "review_text": "This is a great pool game for whenever you're bored. Absoltuely perfect for local multiplayer. I recommend using a controller, the PC controls are ok but controller is the way to go. The music is absolutely amazing and the devs have given quite a bit of extra content for free. Graphics are great (as you can see from the Store images) and there are some fun gamemodes to try. I know some people have suggested that you cannot hit the ball as hard as you would want but I personally do not understand that complaint. I've never wished I could hit it harder, and it's even possible to launch balls off the table if you want to. There must be some agreesive pool players out there! Anyways, I don't remember what I paid for it (I'm thinking around $5-$7) and I feel like I've absolutely got my money's worth. I'd definitely recommend this game for the $7 range. The normal $13 is fine in my opinion, especially if you like pool and/or have someone that wants to play it with you. But if you see it on sale, pick it up! If you can grab the soundtrack with it, I'd also recommend picking that up. Perfect to listen to in the car if you're driving in the rain or at dawn. Really can't praise it enough.  Also the game runs great for me. I've had a cheap GTX750 and a GTX980 and it's been a smooth 60FPS on fullscreen whenever it's on my screen.",
