            "review_text": "A fun but flawed first person shooter. AI has shown the capability to flank however the appearance of rushing the player is apparent. Aliens do have the ability to melee as well as stasis the player so I won't hold AI rushing against the game. Aliens can and do flank though they are not the brightest bulbs and will get themselves killed rather easily when isolated. Boss fights are numerous but straight forward not showing much imagination.  The game has three difficulty modes each increasing in challenge. I started with the middle difficulty but initially my life lasted as long as a Gastrotrich, so normal it was as my mood was for limiting restarts as much as possible given the game's propensity to kill you.  Story elements in the form of recordings are spread around the levels but I only found one third of the content. Whether I missed their obvious placement by chance or because they were hidden is unknown though the story can be ignored from the small portion I heard. Bonus mini pyramids are also strewn about, three per level but again I never completed a set. The pyramids add to your score as Alien Rage awards points during game-play and includes leader-boards as well.   Secondary ammo is also strewn about. They look like suitcases so they aren't hard to miss although initially I wasn't sure what they were which brings us to the weapons. An important part of any shooter. The weapons are imaginative. You get to carry only two plus a revolver. There is a high reliance on secondary fire in order to implement much needed crowd control. Primary ammo is picked up through gun pick ups as a dropped gun retains it's ammo or by walking over the same gun as you possess. Weapons in the game consist of both alien and human. Human weapons consist of differing semi automatic rifles, a sniper rifle, mentioned revolver, shotgun and rocket launcher. Sounds and reads standard however each weapon has an important secondary fire mode as mentioned.   The rocket launcher, for example, when equipped will affect your sprinting ability and to use or un-equip the launcher the full animation must be run through making the weapon a bit strategic and difficult to use, a welcome feature considering the weapon's ability to quickly change the battlefield. Which reminds me of enemy hit-boxes which I found to be well implemented. I can remember shooting a rocket through enemy legs and cursing myself for lack of careful aiming.   The alien arsenal consists of energy weapons and is somewhat more limited. No rocket launcher for example but the weapons are fun to use. The alien rifle for instance has no reloads, however the weapon will overheat, again ensuring the player makes strategic use of the weapon. The alien shotgun is very cool and very powerful, the cool anti gravity secondary fire helps immensely. To summarize the S in FPS, the shooting is exceptional, it's explosive and fun.  Some reviewers have panned the levels as being too generic. So what. The game looks and sounds great. You feel Alien Rage, your feel of the game, both visual and auditory is significant. Many of the levels have nice set pieces and it's great to see a publisher like City Interactive enable their development team to build a game with strong immersive environmental elements. Great explosions not only permeate the combat but play a central role. Graphically the game is exceptional though performance will vary but not enough to detract from the game.   Lastly I will address the utter disaster that is  the Alien Rage checkpoint system . Wait, it is not a system. Systems by definition imply some sort of systematic routine. No, the check-pointing, no, make that the checkpoint restart logic in Alien Rage is not just buggy. I've come to the conclusion that it is unfinished. There is no other reason for checkpoint restarts missing assets, many of which will prevent you from continuing the game. Explosives for blowing apart levels to continue, needed secondary ammunition for combat , platforms not reset so you're left looking like a shopper waiting for a mall elevator.   I've found that after each death, instead of using the checkpoint continue, I had to exit to the main menu and continue from there. It is beyond my wildest imagination how the developers obviously knowing that there checkpoint restart system was broken could not of just rewired their checkpoint code to use the continuation logic from the main menu. From the continue on the main menu the game loaded correctly every time. As the game loads very fast, circumventing the intended method for checkpoint restarts is not a significant issue.  If you enjoy a good FPS then Alien Rage presents itself as a very challenging fun FPS that will satisfy most any FPS urge.",

            "review_text": "Alien Rage Unlimited isn't a bad game per se, but it's not a good one either. The description makes it look and sound like a Bulletstorm clone. Bulletstorm is awesome, but this one... this one is not. There's a variety of moves you can pull off which result in you earning points. Make a headshot and you'll earn a certain amount of points, destroy enemies using explosions and it'll earn you points as well. Well, you get the picture, right ? There aren't enough moves to keep you going so after a while it becomes tiresome and the joy of earning points diminishes.  The levels and enemies are fairly detailed and the whole game looks pretty good, especially considering the price they ask for it.   Thankfully, it's also a pretty short game. Finishing it will take you about 6 hours overall. More than enough if you ever decide to give this a try. There are so many difficulty spikes that it becomes more frustrating than fun halfway through the game. I don't know who programmed this AI but it's terribly unbalanced.  And even though it's not the best game out there it definitely had some good moments. I just wish there were more of those... More Bulletstorm, less Alien Rage please.  [Rating: 63/100]",

Crisp graphics using the Unreal Engine, aliens attacking you at every turn, massive explosions, an Unreal Tournament style announcer when you achieve special kills, simple story line, etc. I almost want to call this game underrated as I picked it up in a bundle and to me it seems better than what one would expect to find in a bundle. I definitely recommend picking this up on sale. like I said, I can't speak to the multi-player as I haven't tried it out yet but if you are looking for a short, fun FPS single player campaign I highly recommend this one.",

The level design is extremly boring and the definition of linear, the only thing thats ever down side paths are dead ends and power ups. There is no branching at all, just one path till the end.  The gunplay is average with only two equipable at a time and a pistol with the same assualt rife, sniper, shotgun, rocket launcher in every game.  The sound design is not that great with weapons lacking punch and the background music being easy to forget, from an arcade shooter I expected somthing like Doom, or Duke Nukem, but instead it's just generic Sci-Fi.

Cover is non-existent and you keep taking damage constantly, even when you hide behind what seems to be usable cover. Level design is mediocre at best. Nothing looks unique, everything is blue, levels are the same. The number of bugs is RIDICULOUS. You can have whole level sections glitched and become unpassable if you die at an inappropriate time. For an Unreal Engine 3 game it is surprisingly unoptimized with framedrops at seemingly empty areas.

            "review_text": "'Alien Rage - Unlimited' is a great FPS game with lots of alien enemies to shoot and blow to bloody pieces.   Yes, there is a storyline to it all: In the future, humans and a race called the Vorus are both mining the same asteroid for Promethium, an extremely valuable source of energy in a world depleted of fossil fuels. In the beginning there is peace and cooperation, but then something goes wrong and carnage follows. You will figure it out as you move through the 14 levels, picking up audio logs along the way that tell of the events that led to you being sent in to mow down any and all alien opposition.  Apart from the lesser enemy types, the game features a whole range of enemy bosses, each requiring its own set of tactics to defeat. There are some really tricky parts - for example, the final boss can be quite difficult at first - however, once you understand how to best use your weapons and environment for each situation (and remember to keep moving), it gets easier. There are three difficulty levels, the lowest (or normal) level being called 'Challenging' - an indication that your first tour isn't necessarily going to be a pushover (depending on your unique experience with FPS games, of course).  Weapons can be divided into two types: projectile and energy, all with secondary fire modes. You can only carry three weapons at once. Of these, only two can be changed for other weapons, because the unlimited ammo pistol (your default weapon) is a fixed necessity - don't underestimate its use, though, for it's a formidable weapon and one can finish the game using it alone (especially with perks tailored to maximize its use).   Players gain a selection of 'perks' (advantages) by stacking up points made from kills, modifying the abilities of weapons, armour or the player's health. For instance, the Mega Pistol perk supercharges the default pistol to give it way more punch.  At times you are able to also pick up a mighty minigun, although it will hamper your speed. The game's shotgun may not be very useful (personally), but there are enough weapons to experiment with as well as a melée attack. In one level you also get to drive a mech, squashing the enemy under metal feet and spewing bullets from your rotating machinegun barrels (it overheats quickly, but this can be helped by chosing the Heavy Weapon Recovery perk).  There aren't all that many controls, which is great - and it can be customized. The jump function very rarely comes into play since the game is structured in such a way that jumping over cumbersome obstacles is eliminated (assisting fast-moving gameplay).  The game has autosave checkpoints, no manual saving. Some players might have an issue with that, for it sometimes means that one has to repeat easier bits before getting back to the action that got you killed. Not really a problem, though. The game has real replay value, especially since global leaderboards are kept: you can try to improve your overall score by replaying individual levels, maybe also to go back for pickups you've missed before, all the while keeping tabs on how other players are getting on.  The game has amazing graphics and scenery/environment.  If you're a fan of the FPS genre, then 'Alien Rage - Unlimited' is worth it.  Enjoy.",

            "review_text": "Score - 65/100 Recommendation - Solid old-school shooter. Fans of Hard Reset rejoice.  This game was quite the surprise for me. I've become rather tough on games in recent years, and I can't even count the number of games I've played this year that I gave up on out of frustration. I tend to have an extremely short fuse when it comes to gameplay mechanics, but I enjoyed this one almost the whole way through.  I'll get this out of the way up front, though. There are some frustrating fights, you will likely die a LOT (even on the so-called normal difficulty), and the weapon choice is severely limited (ie some are entirely useless).  This game hails from the Serious Sam school, where games are almost perfectly linear, and waves of enemies spawn at pre-determined points for pre-determined lengths of time. Unlike Serious Sam, however, this game is short enough that the gimmick doesn't wear out its welcome. I ended up beating Alien Rage in about 6 hours, which I think is just perfect for this kind of mindless action. It seemed like the final level of Serious Sam 3 alone stretched out that long.  The graphics and sounds of Alien Rage fit their purpose as well. The music and sound are nothing to write home about, but the graphics are actually surprisingly nice. There were more than a few points where I simply stopped to admire the scenery. In addition, it's hard not to have a smile on your face while you're running around blasting alien creatures, bits and pieces of them flying around the screen. Such fights are somewhat rare, however, since you will be blasted full of more holes than a cheesecloth if you stay in the open for very long.  Speaking of battles, the boss fights are unfortunately quite poorly-done. There will be early ones where you will die over and over and over and over, and be millimeters from clicking on 'delete local content,' and then there will be later fights where you get a chaingun immediately before (and I do mean IMMEDIATELY), and demolish the boss in a matter of 30 seconds without even having to move. I had far more difficulty with the recharging boss than every other boss combined. Including the final one.  There are a wide variety of level types on tap as well. There are rail shooting levels, mech suit levels, and one style of level where the lights are mostly out and your gun emits a small scanner which illuminates cloaked enemies.  This game will inevitably be compared to Hard Reset, and while the two are quite similar, Alien Rage outshines it in a number of areas. First of all, you can jump in this game, and while that is never EVER actually needed, it makes the movement feel much less stuffy. In addition, the story and acting in Alien Rage are really quite well done. Where Hard Reset's story felt ridiculous, poorly-acted, and peppered with lame attempts at humor, Alien Rage's story is actually complex, engaging, well-acted, and somewhat humorous. It's worth mentioning that Alien Rage's story is almost entirely told through audio logs which can be missed, but I mean it when I say the game is linear; it would be hard to miss too many logs. I didn't look too close, and ended up with 29/33. It's also worth mentioning that there are a LOT of pop culture references. I found them funny, but I know how those annoy some people.  Overall, if you enjoyed Hard Reset (or other oldschool-ish games), you will enjoy this too. It's difficult, fast-paced, bright and shiny, the AI is dumb, and it keeps track of high scores for the competitive folks out there. It has multiplayer too, but I didn't try it. I have a feeling it's just deathmatch.  I recommend picking it up. I can't honestly say I would have happily spent more than $10 on it, but I am notoriously cheap. :)  -DrB",

First of all this is made on Unreal engine 4 i believe (sorry if im wrong) . Engine we all know and love , yet somehow this game will run like poop no matter how expensive your rig is. There are ways around it , tweaking .INI file will solve all performance issues this game has but to make game which runs so bad on such a good and trusted engine is a sin.  Alien rage was first game in 15 years which literally made me sick. I know that people who suffer from motion sickness have issues with certain games making them feel dizzy and giving them headaches. I've never been on that unlucky side. Thou this game managed to almost make me vomit with it's ridiculous motion blur ( which cant be turned off in menu's ) and vomit inducing FX effects . Gladly , again , you can turn them off if you edit .INI file.  Every time you die , and you will die a lot 'cause game is pretty hard , you get your standar 'restart from last checkpoint' option . What's different from other games is that then you do that half of level wont load . Doors wont trigger open , enemies will be invincible,parts you have to interact with wont be interactable. One must go back to main menu and then load last save again. Keeping in mind that game is hard, you will have to do this a lot which sucks joy out of you.  And the worst thing about this game is that.... it's a good game. Game of genre we rarely see these days , old school FPS . Only titles in recent memory which managed to capture this feeling was Hard Reset,Bullet Storm and new Wolfenstein . That's it....and i can add Alien Rage to this small small list now. It's very solid in terms of mechanics, shooting is fun, guns awesome , it requires a lot of skill . No hand helding here.

Unbelievably harshly criticised, this game isn't anything like pro-reviews are saying.  This is IGN's review. 'Between its lack of personality or distinctive, original features of any kind, and completely non-existent multiplayer community, the only memorable aspect is its annoying and frustrating difficulty spikes.'  Complete rubbish. It has originality because there just aren't any FPS sci-fied up games like this about. (No comment on multiplayer other than there might be if they gave it a fair review.) The difficulty spikes are a myth. I played through on hard, out of 1 - challenging, 2 - hard, 3 - brutal. I finished only minutes ago, and I never got stuck on a difficulty spike. I was very worried about getting this game because of this comment. However I loved the demo, and risked buying it, and I am glad I did. Sometimes I had to repeat bits, but I loved it coz I was having such a good time. The weapons and the bad guys are sci-fi spot on. Often I passed checkpoints first time.   It's fairly straight forward. Pick up guns, run over ammo to collect, and shoot the baddies. The plot plays out as you go along, so you just have to get from A-B in one piece. The only time it got tricky was with the boss fights, but I got most of them quite quickly beaten. The last boss may be my favourite all time boss. It was just so cool. The last level was like it was lifted straight out of the closing twenty mins of an action sci-fi movie.  The graphics literally sparkle but you don't need a massive rig to run it. Something like a gen 1 i3 3GHz, and a GTX 650, and you're away with it maxed. I added x32 AA in the Nvidia Control Panel so it looked tidy.  My only criticism is you start every level with a minimum of ammo. Even though you just maybe walked through a door from the last level, you loose heaps of ammo.",

This plays like most other FPS but it has a ton of action and a nice beefy campaign. I have only been playing for a week or so but I'll do my best to tell you my likes and dislikes.   Likes:  - The enemy AI is aggresive and willl come at you from multiple points. - The progression curve on the game is good (you are forced to get better) - The graphics are bright, the explosions are cool and the force feedback is precise (Xbox 360 controller)  Dislikes   - You will die and die and die   The sum it up if you liked a game like Section 8, with better AI and better graphics, you will like this. I think the bundle might stilll be available on Bundle Stars. This game is well worth the price of the bundle alone.",

Wordywords: I rarely do write reviews but I do wanna give this one a thumbs-up here because I was positively surprised and glad to get this one when I did.  CI games did deliver a game that does NOT deliver on what it promises, so be aware of that, but that's okay!  Unless I am mistaken, 'oldschool styled shooter game' refers to the very simple and straightforward FPS of the yester-year, like your Dooms or Half Lifes or such. And while I will admit that this game does very little to hold you back from the action, one important thing is that this has 2 additions that make it not old-school anymore. Leveling up and regenerating health. But please, in the context of things, it makes sense and it delivers otherwise on intensive shooter action, well worth your money. I would even go as far as to say that 20 bucks is a fair price if you really are into FPSs and are on the look for something familiar yet new.  Essentially it plays like the modern day shooter with old-school excess. The story can be ignored if wished as it does not push up much beyond some lines of dialogue and the audio-logs you can listen to. to me, those were a welcome breather inbetween fights, so it was all welcome.  The health you got at basic difficulty ('Challenging' is the lowest difficulty I can see) is big enough to sustain a good few shots but small enough to not have you juggernaut throughout everything without some care. It kept me fairly busy and I died a fair amount of times at points, but the reloading (checkpoints) is short and did not bother me, even when recording.  The weapons are mostly fairly run-of-the-mill with the exception being a late-game alien-gun that still handles like an assault-rifle, but the difference are the 2nd fire modes, which I really like. all the guns, even your side-arm, have a 2nd fire-mode that costs a secondary ammo type, which is limited but still plentiful enough to use, so don't worry about stock-piling them for bigger encounters. Enjoy away! Even if most of them still just go 'boom', they go 'boom' in such a joyful and sometimes silly manner.  Also the perks-system in the game, it started off incredibly slow for me as I did not pick up all the collectibles and did not too well on special kills, but after some time I started getting all the unlocks and I was able to actually adjust a few basic things until the last tier, which gave me an unlock that just kept me giggling like an idiot. Let's just say, if you fancy yourself a gunslinger and wanna do a challenge run, there might be something at the end.  Lastly, while some of the checkpoints are far-appart and the bosses aren't stretching the limits of enemy design, it was always tight enough to be a small to fair challenge (for me) and otherwise easily doable after adapting a little bit.  Highly recommended and I do hope this gets some more people to pay attention to this game and the devs, as I am starting to get curious about them.",

            "review_text": "CI GAMES - Game creators of two very underrated titles. ALIEN RAGE &amp; ENEMY FRONT. One is set upon an asteroid where the hero survives a variety of aliens to eventually destory the mothership and stave off intergalatic war. The other enemy front is based in Nazi occupied Poland ( a very understated part of WW2) where you play a journalist whos really good with sniper rifles. Alien Rage is your average corridor, linear shooter. Its an experience well done in the fps world... so ♥♥♥♥♥ what. It is a great game to play with awesome weapons, AGGRESSIVE enemies that will storm right up to your huddling behind the crate a$$ and sucker punch you in the teabag. This games wants you to be filled with Rage, and by the end its ever increasing RAGE will have you RAGING also. For being in a genre so over done with rugged cliche space marine vs the universe this game is worth it for the on average 6 hours to beat gameplay. 3 settings take it from challening to hard to brutal. Each play through is enjoyable. Alien Rage is best compared to BULLETSTORM - the most comedic and entertaining FPS game yet. Alien Rage gets rid of the comedy and one-liners for standard mission blah blah about what next needs to be blown up, but it keeps the kill for point system Bulletstorm utilized - but on a signifigantly less complex or creative format. Alien Rage adds in a perk system that allows the player to swap out certain buffs ( raise dmg by 10%, lower dmg by 10%, etc).  The only thing I disliked about Alien Rage was the 1001% accuracy of the enemies, they can hit yo sh-t from the other side of the moon with a fuggin slingshot. You've been warned. My perception of why these bots have such good aim is that the game doesnt want you ducking it out like Gears of War or some other cover/conceal game, it wants you out in the action running around head-shotin, gut-punchin, and demoltion explodin the hell out of the alien menace.  Alien Rage also has the multiplayer component, which is fast paced, simple (reminds me of Quake), and still balanced. As of this review in 07/2016 I have seen servers on the multiplayer once in awhile but, there are few of them about 4-5 with only 6 to 8 players on each. The average is that you will not find any. I purchased Alien Rage for 1.99 during the 2016 summer sale, and Enemy Front during another sale period, I have played through both twice and looking forward to a third time. A great game to boot up and get one checkpoint to checkpoint area done before being tugged back into the boring realm of life here on Earth.",
