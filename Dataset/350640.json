Only the hunting scene was a little too long and too... odd. But these new cases are very enjoyable. I understand the developers to not change any of gameplay first time in this series. I already could play the next title with this very same engine. But please... less running, escaping, hunted actions.",

This is not an adventure game like any of the previous Sherlock Holmes games from Frogwares. There are no skips on the running around getting shot scenes, but there are skips for the dexterous who cannot solve simple puzzles and make mind numbingly easy deductions. So when the adventure aspect is made ridiculously simple and the action is the main focus then this is not an adventure game by any stretch of the imagination. I am so done with this series. Action gamers will probably like it, but I am saying not recommended becasue the series' base of customers was always adventure gamers and they will most likely be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "so far, I feel I like the game is very similar to crime and punishments, the game mechanics are still similar (focus. action sequence, profiling characters, mini puzzles). The only thing different is the look of the characters, the voice, more action, and a predictable story.   I guess making characters younger and more appealing is the standard nowadays. It's a little eerie seeing watson look so much like dorian from dragon age, it's creepy and strange because i feel like its the same voice actor......  so far I enjoyed the cases and i think it get's progressively harder trying to figure out the motive of each character such as orson wilde in the third case. I also have this feeling that there are way more mini puzzles than im use to. But i can let that slide.  The only thing I couldn't stand was the little girl(katlyn) and the typical lady next door (alice). Right away I could tell something sinister was going on with the lady and her motives. And from the looks of the trailer she might be that bloody witch that will steal your daughter. And what do you know you will find a major secret once you pry deeper into her life when she starts getting 'close' to alice. Even the way the little girl laughs is a bit too much and I find it grossly annoying and even as you constantly tell the little tyke 'NO' she doesn't back down which makes you even more frustrated.   Eh. but getting to the point I thought the story was predictable in a way with predictable characters, cases are good, but I haven't been entranced yet. so far 6.5/10",

            "review_text": "I haven't played any Sherlock Holmes games before this one, except for a demo of one really old one and the first one which only lasted me a few minutes before I couldn't handle its age.  This is a fun game, not particularly challenging, as it lets you skip the puzzles you struggle with, but if you actually ignore that temptation, there are a few fun to solve puzzles (and a few not so fun ones). Some are easy, some are a bit more challenging, but none are really hard.  In terms of investigation, you need to use the information gathered to draw your own conclusions (as long as they fit within the very thick lines drawn for you). Usually a case has 2 to 3 possible suspects, it is up to you to decide who is the guilty party. Sometimes you can end a case in like 5 minutes if you don't particularly care about being thorough and correct. That's an interesting idea. These decisions are nice and all, but they don't particularly have any impact, as there is literally a button to go back and make a different choice when you see that you were wrong.  There are some stealth sequences, but I managed to finish them all first time without failing, so they are quite easy and not really tedious at all. The only irritating one was one of those terrible Assassin's Creed-like follow the suspect sequences, where the guy constantly turns around to check for followers. Nobody does that. Video games pls.  All in all, it's a fun little time, you'll get about 9 hours out of it, solve some interesting cases, meet some interesting people, do a few QTEs, solve a few puzzles and then be vaguely disappointed, but not terribly so, by the ending. You might even like the ending, but it just seems like it could've had a little more build up to end in a slight bit more payoff.   You might like this if you: - Like those old CSI games. - Liked the previous Sherlock Holmes game (Crimes &amp; Punishment, I believe it was) - Liked LA Noire but would've preferred for the open world to not be there. - Are a superfan of anything relating to Sherlock Holmes.",

            "review_text": "Why did you change the character models, did you make Holmes look like a ♥♥♥♥ing bum so you could charge for this ridiculous costume dlc. Seriously DLC for this type of game!? After playing through the first case which was predictable from the start (except I could never guess the hobo running in the beginning was actually Holmes), I am disappointed in the direction the game is heading. I want more of an adventure game not an action adventure.   Then I played the second case and this is where it became clear that this is nothing like the old games, I don't like it, too many minigames and QTE bs. It becomes more like Indiana Jones at one point ffs. The only thing about this case that reminded me of Sherlock Holmes was that if you read the books you would understand what they loosely lifted out from one of the stories and inserted it into this case.   The game looks good though and in the first case although almost completely lacking in any sort of puzzles or mystery solving is entertaining for what it is, just not a Sherlock Holmes game. Call him Furlock Bones and I wouldn't complain too much. I just know from playing the other games the wasted potential. After playing the second case I can't recommend it, not for this price at least.  After finishing this game which also felt incredibly short, I am even more disappointed. The writing was really lacking, everything felt very rushed and shoehorned in to try and tie the overall main story together and it didn't work. The fundamental problem is that Holmes's personality is different, he would never have a daughter and in a lot of situations he acted wildly out of character.",

I recommend waiting until it's on sale (buy it at whatever price doesn't break the bank, and don't buy with money that could be used for non video game related items)  There are alot of naysayers about this game but here are the simple facts. + Beautiful world (even with low graphics..... You can walk around London more!) +The Mechanics of SH: Crimes and Punishments +Added Hard difficulty so that the cases aren't spoonfed +(My Opinion) Interesting cases,  +more disguise usage, and better Imagination Talent sequences, more Watson usage  / (Either Pos or Neg) Sherlock sort of has a daughter in this one, however it is purposeful and interesting / Minigames, I personally thought they were well used to add challenge and keep the player interested while actually being doable, (Unlike the Rope Bridge in SH C&amp;P)  /Kinda weird finale... but nothing that's too hard to overlook /Sherlock and Watson look less Sherlock-y and Watson-y, but they basically added Sherlock's Overcoat outfit from the TV show so that's cool /Unsure about replay value  -May be a little overpriced due to how new it is -Seems like it may be a little short, but then again so did SH Crimes and Punishments ",

            "review_text": "A triumph in the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes series.  I've been an avid fan of this series for the last 7+ years, and I have to hand it to Frogwares. They keep hitting it out of the park.   Graphics: 10/10. Luscious scenes, and a rich recreation of London. Beautiful graphics, especially for a Point n' click style adventure. A lot of visual easter eggs to previous games that fans will enjoy.  Audio/Voice Acting: 8/10. Top notch voice acting, ambience, and music (the ending credit music/theme is a tremendous addition). Love the usage of songs from the earlier games in the series (During the bowling pitch segment). One complaint is the different Watson visual/voice. The Watson from C&amp;P was perfection. Same with Holmes, but Holmes is close enough to the previous games, that I adjusted within 10 minutes. Puzzles: 9/10. The puzzles are FAR superior to the ones in C&amp;P, which had seemed to be a mere afterthought. These puzzles will get you thinking, and will challenge even a seasoned adventure gamer. Action Sequences: 4/10. Next time, just ditch these. The one downside of the game. But, thankfully these are not too abundant. Storyline: 10/10. Beautiful and intriguing mysteries. Well written characters. The hallmark of an excellent adventure game. The dark twists to the mysteries in Devil's Daughter are very much appreciated - they hearken back to the excellent 'Holmes: The Awakened'. Length: ~12/14 hours, depending on how much times you take in the scenery, and sleuth it out. But most every minute of those 12/14 hours will be entertaining, no lulls in the gameplay. WHAT AN ENDING. Wow. Overall, probably my favorite storyline/cases of the entire series. Price: I imagine Big Ben Interactive, the new publisher, might be the reason for the steep $50 price tag on this Holmes game. I personally feel $35/$40 is the sweet spot for a top notch adventure game, and tend to reserve the $50/$60 spot for AAA open world games/RPGs/Shooters which have longer playtime. I'd recommend this on a sale (I myself took advantage of the pre-order sale which knocked it down to $30) -One Note: I recommend playing Testament of Sherlock Holmes, and Crimes and Punishment first, and then continuing on to this game. You will enjoy the build up and the series much more.   All in all, I highly recommend The Devil's Daughter to any adventure gamer, especially one with a Whodunnit/Detective bent (I wish Her Interactive would finish up 'Midnight at Salem' already). There aren't close to enough games in this genre available, and I'm so thankful that Frogwares continues to carry Sherlock Holmes' torch forward.   9/10.",

            "review_text": "Devil`s Daughter is not so bad Sherlock Holmes game, it still follow steps of earlier Crimes and punishment. So I can say I liked play this game even it left me cold.  In Devil`s daughter there is couple really nice and new things in cases. But I believe developer did not have enough time to finish the game complete. I say that because Devil`s Daughter just turn to end suddenly. In my opinion it did not made sense. That just mirror rush to end game quickly. Aswise all cases are like running true missions. What is really shame. There is trown away all potential what is in this game, definitely after earlier Sherlock game. So I dont recommend to buy this game in full prize. But definitely, if you like Sherlock games, you have to buy this later from sales.  Play true takes about 15h and there is not much replay value like in Crimes and punishment. So what I can say shortly. I waited better planed and longer cases, fully made game, replay value and intensive story. That did not happen, but I got 15h unfinished halfly done Sherlock experiense with full prize. So Devil`s daughter is not best Sherlock game but it is not worst either. It is only damn halfly done and there is way too many of those frustrating fast based 'press right button'-parts what are totally nonsense parts of story... and Sherlocks character is ruined.. and.. and.. You really should play Crimes and punishments first case true and you see how big step they got backward with Devil`s daughter..   By the way, 3rd trailer do not match to game anyway. Maybe those are parts what developers did not get ever done.",

            "review_text": "This game is fantastic. It reminds me of games I used to play as a kid. The puzzles are HARD. It makes you stuck, hating yourself, and wanting to punch your monitor or delete the game altogether. Haha. It's sadistic but the puzzles are amazing for me.. I mean, who doesn't like a hard challenge? I've had friends at times help me through with their second set of eyes. I needed a WATSON! :D And it is so gratifying once we complete the puzzles together. If you are looking for a purely detective-game a la L.A. Noire, this is not for you. This has a lot of Lara Croft elements to it. There are no hints as to how you are supposed to solve each puzzle-like-situation. You have to figure it out on your own. You will fail and die time and time again, each time learning something new, trying to get through the challenging-mental situation with a new insight. It is not friendly - there are no hints. You'll need a pen and paper like old-skool games. You'll need to research inside Holmes' library of books and yes actually read those books in-game. You'll have to look at an old map with fading ink and tiny fonts to figure out where to go next with limited hints. The game gives you the option of skipping the puzzles or challenging situations - but if you do that, you will not enjoy the game for what it is supposed to be because that is 90% the point of it. You'll end up with a short-game and disillusioned as to why the story-line and dialogues are short and wonder what you spent your money on. I only recommend this game for people who *ARE* into challenges and puzzles and don't mind failing over and over for the satisfaction of getting through it through perserverence, smarts, and patience eventually.    I needed to say this due to the bad press from people whom I've noticed 'SKIPPED' all the puzzles. :p What a shame.",

In this episode of Sherlock Holmes you solve few crimes and talk to dead people? Yeah, they went all out on this game. The first case is pretty simple, trying to find some kid's father, or that what I thought. The second case is to find out who killed this guy, oh it was a statue that walk because of a Mayan curse. Ok. Third one is simple, who tried to kill Sherlock, oh now I suspect an American actor that came to study Sherlock. No Problem. Fourth case, what can possibly can happen? Oh, I can talk to ghosts. sure.  Sherlock Holmes The Devil's Daughter is a really great game, I finished the game in little over 8 hours in one sitting. The cases are well made, most minigames and puzzles are really fun and there are really funny or really cool parts that you just want to play to see more.  If you played Crime and Punishment, you will have no problem with this game, it's the same game but different cases. Controls are the same, deductions are the same.  My main promblem with this game is that it's too short. I don't remember how long was C&amp;P but I feel this game is shorter, but I could be wrong. I finished the game in one session in little over 8 hours. I didn't plan to finish it that quickly but the game was really fun and I just wanted 'one more case' or 'one more puzzle', and that made me finish the game way to fast.  The main story to this game is really wierd. A new neighbour appeared and damn, she looks FIIINE. Alice is Sherlock's new neighbour and ofcourse Watson trying to hit off with her. Also, Sherlock has a daughter now, Kate. During the cases we see more and more of Kate and Alice, who are BFFs now. We learn that Sherlock killed Kate's real Father and adopted her and she don't know that. During the last case we find out more of Alice. She is the daughter of a criminal Sherlock locked away years ago, we find out she is doing wierd devil's cult stuff, and that she is spying on use. The last chapter of the game is not a case, and it's super wierd. Kate is gone and Sherlock suspects Alice. Stuff happen, Sherlock talks to dead people, we save Kate from a burning boat and we also had a nice stroll in the old cemetry. Overall, the cases are great, I found myself reviewing the case from A to Z to get the right conclusion (1 wrong conclusion and the others are right) just because the case is so difficult and everyone could do that crime.  Controls are not the best, using mouse and keyboard is not optimal for this game, just like in C&amp;P but I managed.  Pros: +Good Main Story +Fun and Hard Cases +Funny and Interesting Characters +Great Puzzles  Cons: -Main Story Just Became Wierd in the Last 30mins of the Game. -Control are Wonky for Mouse and Keyboard. -Short Game (8 hours of the hardest difficulty and doing all puzzles and no skipping) -One Case is Ripped Word per Word from Conan Doyle's Stories (though that case is about 5 mins intro to a bigger case) -Everybody is the Offender (found myself thinking that every suspect has a motive, way and means to do the crime)  Overall, I reccomand this game for fans of Sherlock Holmes, I really enjoyed it, though it was short, I will replay this game and try to find the real offender in that one case that I was wrong and just to have more Sherlock while I wait for the 2017 Sherlock Holmes.",

Now, granted, game isnt perfect, but even compared to 'Crimes &amp; Punishments', this is huge step forward. I especially like the fact that you can explore a lot more than in C&amp;P. It really is lovely game to see victorian London.  Story is great- it has smaller segments of story as cases &amp; also overarching story between cases that really has great endgame. Now, i dont know if its possible to get multiple endings (if it is, it all the more adds to it, if not, got to admit, that kinda takes tension out of final segment). Detective work is good, but its perhaps even bit too easy (i played on normal). I mean i often found hardest part to be profiling someone and while it was great to see you could miss someone's profile, i was bit disappointed to see it didnt play any role.  What can be considered huge con in game are filler puzzles, such as lockpicking or creating a path to some location. There are few minigames as well, that more often than not will be part of this. Still, most puzzles are optional, allowing you to focus on detective work alone. Exceptions are finding the path puzzles, which are probably slowest ones in game. Still, at least they vary a lot.  So verdict- not perfect game, has some good but underutilised ideas, maybe more streamlined than c&amp;p, but is this game worth it? definetly.",
