            "review_text": "I have probably spent more hours playing this game more than any other. Played it when it first came out almost 25 years ago and still find myself booting it up. I'm glad it's on Steam now. If this game had modern graphics and was re-tooled for mobile or ipad, I imagine it could sell. Here's my pitch.  Its beauty is its simplicity. Infantry divisions, tank divisions, air wings, carrier groups, destroyer groups, submarines, cities, bases, oil fields. That's pretty much it. And spy satelites for certain scenarios. World War I, WW II, WW III (NATO vs. Warsaw Pact, WW IV (~ WW III), and WW V. I suggest World War V to start- cities are randomized on the map. You start at one city and your opponent starts in one other city with no spy satellites allowed.  The elephant in the room is the graphics. Admittedly, I cut it some slack because I grew up with it, but, honestly, it doesn't affect the gameplay, which is solid.  Finally, for STEAM, this games NEEDS a manual (for basic UI and minutiae)! For players, you may find tips and shortcuts elsewhere on the web. One tip - the menus are at the top of the screen window - just hover your mouse near the top and the menus will appear. If I get some time, maybe I will write up a quick starter guide.",
