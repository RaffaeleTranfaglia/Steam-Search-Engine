            "review_text": "An amazing game, a rare treat on steam, if you are into graffiti art this game is for you. This game has some graffiti artists such as COPE2, OBEY, FUTURA, SEEN, T-KID, and SMITH (they play as themselves) and many more artist that are featured. This game also has a great cast such as Talib Kweli, Adam West, Brittany Murphy (R.I.P), Charlie Murphy, Geogre Hamilton, Giovanni Ribisi, Rosario Dawson, The RZA, Sean 'Diddy' Combs, MC Serch, and Andy ♥♥♥♥. Original music by The RZA and RJD2. Gameplay is dated. The story fits with the game and does not feel like a waste of good talent. The graphics do not look bad ps2 quality. The music and the art is true to the graffiti lifestyle. This game is fun and may even inspire some to make art as it did for me. This game works best with a Xbox controller and is working fine on windows 8.1. Thanks to publisher Devolver Digital for bringing this game back.",

You take the role as Trane a young teen who wants to follow in his father's footsteps as a graffiti artist. The game takes you on action/adventure with hours of gameplay and for an old game the A.I and graphics work very well for old mechanics. Its a absoutle must buy for 6 pound well worth it.",

The buttons for a lot of things are sort of weirdly placed and the gamepad controls are impossible to use. The graphics are so-so, and the movement for combat is smooth, but the freerunning they expect you to do is stunted and filled with awkward motions and delays that just make the 'experience' rather unimpressive in the end. The music isn't bad and I'd consider getting a copy of the soundtrack to add to my collection of music.",
