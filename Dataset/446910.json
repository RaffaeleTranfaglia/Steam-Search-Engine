            "review_text": "I played the Gamejolt version of this game, and I just started this version. You're not going to see any changes in the mechanics of the game, the core is still there. Which is a great thing. Gary has worked his ♥♥♥ off to get this game where it is, and it shows! Gary and I have become good aquantinces, so I've been able to see this game come from where it began, to being a popular game on Steam and I could not be more proud.   You take the roll of a child at night, trying to protect your family from the Night Blights. To do this, you need to keep wardrobes closed and the blights fed using your toys. As you progress through the night, this is going to become more and more difficult with more mechanics being added. To add to that, the more you run..the more tired you get. If you let yourself get too tired, you will fall asleep. Ending the game and everyone dies.   The jumpscares are completely random based on how you manage your time and energy. So you can't telegraph when the next scare is coming. This really is a gem of a game, and I hope that Gary and Trapdoor games does extremely well with the new release.  ",
