Now I'm not trying to say this is among the best adventure games but it is very enjoyable even after my low expections going in. This game is pretty good but I only recommend it if you have every other game on your adventure game to do list crossed off and you really need a new one.",

            "review_text": "As with all the others done by the same company it's a fun adventure title with a lot of laughs. However the flower puzzle near the end can die in a coal fire for all I care, argh.  It seems to be based on the same UI as the last Runaway game, meaning you get a button to ask for help and a button to see all the hotspots just in case you believe you are missing something, but not sure what. not to mention, the help was far better too.  Love the ending and it's quite a interesting political story to it too. Can't wait to try out their other game, Yesterday.",

Play switches frequently between Liz Allaire and Dan Murray, the only two playable characters. The puzzles are not particularly challenging and the game doesn't last that long, but it's a cutesy, fun ride with plenty of gags.  If you need cheering up, play this game!",

            "review_text": "I have not played a point and click in a while, actually I have not played once since re doing some retro classics last year. So foundly I love some of the cartoon styles used in this game. The funny animation and use of character design, plot and verbal fun that can make these games so special.  Well the Next Big this is just like the old style of games - the funny lines and speach are some of the best, this to me is just great.   The graphics and amination fit in well and nothing stands out of place.  Music, sounds and speech are top notch. But I did find a few things that just went bleep sound, I would of really liked to have some funny talking when things should not work, or even some more commical sounds.  It really has some nice puzzle hints, help system, also a double mouse click for fast travel and this is something I have not seen in other point and clickers. Help is so needed with some of the really odd puzzles and item combinations in a few I played.   The game feels a bit too short and the main characters could always come back, it just seems like one chapter in a life story. But until the next big thing... I think I will see what other point and clickers this studio has to offer.  And being on Steam it offers cloud saves, steam play (but no Linux), but no trading cards.  * One slight failure was the annoying random crashes, then you found that you forgot to save because your enjoying it so much - but once you work out how to solve the puzzles, then your quickly complete everything again anyway and remember this time to save.",

It's 'disconcerting' at times (which is good) and even sometimes confused and confusing (which is not so good, but it's always due to lack of attention), everything is forgiven because of it's refreshing mix of original scenes.",

            "review_text": "A pleasant but short point and click game. The visuals are nice and the vocie acting is charming. The story though pretty short was enjoyable enough but it is the charactes that really made an impact. The main duo was really enjoyable and the side characters were interesting even though i could not help but think that some of them should have gotten some more screentime. The game certainly feels complete but i get the feeling that it was planned to be more than it actually is.  The point and click mechanics are solid and for the most part the puzzles didn't get too obscure and far fetched for me. There have a system which lets you see everything that is interactable in an area and this is something that i really enjoy. Nothing is more infuriating that not being able to solve a puzzle just because you didn't realize that the slightly different colored rock on the ground was interactable. There is also a hint system which i used at some times.  But overall this is a short and charming point and click adventure game. I would recommend it for people with an interest in the genre. ",

Nice storytelling part, although story itself is not very complex. It's not Sherlock Holmes type of game, so we'll let it slide on story part.  Game does not have any major con's, but it's also not super inventive in any part.  Would rate it 6.5 of 10.   I recommend it to play in between the break of two more serious games to relax. :)",
