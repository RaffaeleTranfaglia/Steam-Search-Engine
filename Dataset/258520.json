The story is engaging and mysterious and keeps you hooked until the very end as you explore the relatively large island. There are dozens of interesting corners of the island to discover that include some light puzzling and side stories. Overall it was a beautiful game worth its asking price of $20.

            "review_text": "I absolutely loved playing this!  To make the review short and simple I'll stick with the pros and cons of it.   PROS:    + Graphics -  it's one of the best looking games I've ever played, incredibly well polished.   + Immersion -  there's no HUD, no hints, nothing on the screen to distract you from this immersive experience (I can only hope to replay it in a few years with oculus rift support).   + Soundtrack -  one of my favourite things about this game! It can be beautiful and yet, at the same time, bitter. It really helps to set the tone.   + Story -  it's not the game's strongest point and   it ends in a bit of a cliché way  , but it still manages to be very enjoyable and interesting.    CONS:    x Playtime -  sadly this game is very short, you can finish it after around 4-6 hours. It might help extend it's duration if you just walk around in the woods, the scenery is beautiful and perfect to expand your screenshot library.   x Low Replay Value -  pratically nonexistent. No achievements, no side stories. After you finish it, it basically becomes the best walking simulator in your game library (which might be fine for some).   Playing 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' was like going to a really good restaurant - you pay for the quality, not the quantity - because even though it's quite short, everything about it is close to being perfect. 9/10",

It is filled with exploration, mysteries that need solving, some minor puzzles, and lots of atmosphere. It is not for everyone. You won't find any fps action here or deep mechanics. Its amazing in its simplicity and really hits the heart if you fully immerse yourself for the ride. I played it in the dark with my headset on late at night and i was delighted by the mysteries as they unfolded. I'd have to give this a 10/10 for an indie title that doesn't disappoint and which left it's mark.",

            "review_text": "Prettiest hiking simulator I've ever played, 10/10.  On a more serious note, this game will not appeal to everyone. If you prefer action-horror titles with strong thrill factors and quick plot pacing, this game may feel a little empty and...well...like a hiking simulator (albeit an absolutely stunningly detailed one.)  There is no HUD in this game, no map, no compass and notably, no visual indication of the passage of in-game time (the sun is fixed about 15 degrees above the horizon, creating gorgeous sunset shadows that really highlight the team's mastery of Unreal Engine's lighting effects.)   Gameplay consists of wandering through lush forrests and crumbling turn-of-the-20th-century industrial architecture looking for small mystery scenes, usually indicated by bobbing white text over any object that can be interacted with. The scenes weave a narrative that can be loosely linear, although finding a piece of the story's thread non-linearly in no way spoils the effect. If you've played Dear Esther, you'll find a more cohesive plotline but a very similar feeling narrative structure.  If you're looking to quickly advance the story, this game leaves very much wanting - the mini mystery puzzles are few and far between, expect to spend approximately 10% of this game actually involved in gameplay and the rest of the time exploring and seeking out the next scene.   Exploration in this game is a reward in and of itself, but not in the sense that you'll find a unique item or clever easter egg. Rather, the highlights of exploration will be to find particularly stunning view points where the sun quite literally bursts forth through the clouds and illuminates a vast and breathtaking vista in the valleys below, or marvelling at the craftsmanship and detail that went into the making of this world (I particualarly enjoyed the crests placed on the family tombstones in the graveyard - attention was paid to even minute details.)  Learning one thing early in gameplay will save you quite a bit of time and frustration - the mini crime scenes are generally confined to an area no larger than a few hundred square yards, so if you find yourself going on quite a hike looking for a missing piece of the puzzle you should go back and re-examine the scene.  TL;DR - Buy this game if you want a gorgeous (the visuals alone immersed me immediately) and thoughtful mystery horror adventure (think LA Noir crossed with Dear Esther in a more Lovecraftian world) with a strong emphasis on narrative and environment. If you prefer more action oriented games like Silent Hill or Slenderman this may be slower and emptier than you seek. If you ever question whether a game can also be art, buy this immediately.",

            "review_text": " I couldn't post a review under the Redux version, so I had to install the 10GB original and run it for 5 minutes. The Redux version took me 4.7 hours to finish, so pay no attention to the time on record. It's the same game, story-wise and otherwise-wise.   This would be the first game I'd recommend if you hated Dear Esther. It's hard not to compare the two, but The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is more of a game whereas Dear Esther was an experience or experiment in storytelling. To me it was an unforgettable experience, rarely a game has crawled under my skin like Dear Esther, but truth be told, I've only finished it once. That doesn't take away the goosebumps and the emotions I went through, but replayability is an important thing to any gamer. I can't help but sneer at the term walking simulator though, cos it sort of closes the door on any experiment or game not conforming to the norm. While gameplay is king, I'd rather have access to new ideas than play the 400th Mario game, because the platforming is so timeless. Restricting player movement in a game goes against every instinct in your body, cos games are supposed to be liberating experiences, but on the other hand you have highly scripted games that are rewarded with your hard-earned €60 for doing the exact same thing.  Our notions of pricing is another thing that's put to the test when playing these sort of games, which is understandable, but Ethan Carter steps comfortably out of the danger zone of being completed in 2 hours on your first playthrough. It lets you experience its story by having you solve multiple murders and puzzles, but mainly murders as you walk or run through the absolutely stunning Red Creek Valley. Considering how believable the location is and my cursed compulsion to seek out every corner, I would've hated this game with a passion if I hadn't had the option to sprint and I mean properly sprint not just walk faster, which some games seem to mix up. Sprinting would've destroyed Dear Esther, but here it's unavoidable, especially with the risk of backtracking.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter looks so good you wish you had the PC to be able to max it out, at least in my case, cos with the use of photogrammetry it literally looks picture perfect. You would gladly walk, admire your surroundings and forget the gameplay, but there is no need to go exploring every nook and cranny. There are only a couple of items off the beaten path; this is no game of collectibles. The words Inspect and Read hover over every item worth looking at. To avoid backtracking though you need to pay attention, cos every puzzle needs to be solved in order to finish the game.  I can't say what the story is about without spoiling it, but you'll notice right away that this isn't a detective story rooted in reality. It's a nice mix between Dear Esther and Alan Wake. Often times I was enjoying the sights and the simple gameplay of putting murder scenes together that I didn't bother putting the actual story together, cos you're so used to a paranormal angle that it's become normal, which is why I was caught off guard by the games ending. Having only played the Redux version, which has a better save system though higher system requirements and the risks of backtracking aside, the gorgeous game world, its Lovecraftian tone and a good story make it a worthy experience.  EDIT:  A tip from grandsong: If you're not interested in walking, in keybindings change Run to W, so you can rest that pinky finger of yours.",

Best looking game I have ever seen. The use of photogrammetry to create the photo realistic environments left me completely stunned and being able to run a beautiful game like this on 4k was a HUGE plus(it's very well optimized) Story was really interesting. Kept me intruiged and entertained throughout the entire game and it was paced so well and the lack of hand holding combined with the lack of UI got me completely immersed and made me feel like a detective. I also love the business model. A short game(almost like a double length movie) for a fair price. I crave more games like this. The music is awesome. It's beautiful and it has just the right amount of scary moments and upbeat moments to keep you playing and keep you interested in whats going to happen next.  I livestreamed everything on my twitch channel  (www.twitch.tv/wheeze202)  and I have never played a game that has generated more highlight worthy moments. I will definitely buy the collectors edition to support the devs and get that lovely soundtrack.",

            "review_text": "This is a stunningly beautiful adventure game played from the first person perspective. I did a mistake by calling such a game an FPS (see my Stanley Parable review) so in order to avoid the ranting of other gamers let's clarify that while it does resemble that particular genre it does not have any weapons at your disposal.   You do not fight, you do not have boss battles, you do not even have levels to complete. You just walk in a vast, wonderfully crafted world and you are completely free to go anywhere you want to. You play a detective who arrives to the fictional area called Red Creek Valley to find a missing boy, Ethan Carter.  You can inspect objects throughout the game and you also find several dead bodies. The idea of every 'section' of the game it to find out how the people in question were killed and by whom. Once all items / objects are found / inspected, you can utilise your sense ability which enables you to reassemble the murder from the various 'memory' fragments given. Once the chronological order is selected properly you can move onto the next piece of mystery.  I can't say enough how good the graphics are in this game. The atmosphere (thanks to the accompanying sound effects and music) is just excellent and it makes you stop and look at your surrounding area several times. And the game lets you do that - there's no time limit and no way to die and reload. You are free to complete the mystery at your own leisure.  Oh, yes, and while the game has excellent graphics it does run very well - I have to admit, though, I encountered some occasional stuttering which various forums seem to confirm. Hopefully, one patch will fix this as it is an underlying issue irrespective of the hardware you have for the game.  To summarise: Ethan Carter is an interesting, new take on adventure gaming. In my opinion, it is a rather unique and wonderfully done software that - and this is important to highlight - may not be to everybody's liking. However, if you liked Dear Esther, Gone Home or Stanley Parable you may just as well enjoy this one.",

            "review_text": "9.5/10. This game was fantastic. It has been a long time since I found a game that I was desperate to play more of. This game delivers a purely story driven experience with simplistic controls that is presented in a new and refreshing way using gameplay mechanics not seen before. The end came too soon and I am desperate for another game of this type from the same developers. There are no difficulty settings and the game does not 'hold your hand'(This is an actualy thing the game tells you that it does not do). This makes the game difficult in a few places where you may be wondering where to go but helps with immersion as there is no HUD and you are free to take in the GORGEOUS environement with no distractions. This game is ♥♥♥♥ING GORGEOUS by the way. Worth the money just to see what developers can do with map/level design and visual blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of your mind ♥♥♥♥! Although this game only took 8 hours to play and seems to have very little replay value I highly suggest that everyone pick it up as it has a solid plot that will leave you with a rockhardon for good stories and make you wonder why the ♥♥♥♥ you played BF4's campaign. If you like mystery/suspense(somewhat) and want to remember why video games are the ♥♥♥♥ then this is the one. Everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how it was too short but just take your time with it. If you're like me 95% of the story based games in your library aren't completed and it's really nice to play a shorter game that I was able to finish in a decent amount of time that didn't give me an extra 8 hours of filler that was slow and annoying. Content that is in the game is full and enjoyable. If you really don't think it's worth the $20 then put it on your wishlist(please, please do this, it's such a good game) and buy it as soon as it goes on sale. Now go forth master race and enjoy!",

Bluntly, yes - But it's a 4 hours you'd be happy you gave up when you finish the game.   It's hard to explain this game without giving much away, but I'll try. You play as Paul Pospero, a detective who traveled to Red Creek Valley to find Ethan Carter. On the journey, you'll see that a lot more has gone on than the fact that Ethan has gone. The twist is that you can see in to the past when core objects related to the mystery are found and put in their correct places.  When you get dropped in to the game, it's all down to you, the whole 'This game does not hold your hand' screen at the beginning really means it. There is no order in the way you solve things either - 'go do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want' has never been so literal in a game before.

            "review_text": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is, first and foremost, a really beautiful game. Some former employees of People Can Fly were responsible for this game, and apparently they got the employee who knew all about making beautiful enviroments. So there's a bunch of rotting old machinery among woodland forests, but it's organized so thoughtfully and animated so well that it all just seems perfectly natural and you're immersed in fears of tetanus and hidden mountain lions. Mountain lions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  The second - and this is a huge point of contention for people as to whether the game should be bought - is pretty much a supernatural murder mystery played out between sparse puzzles in stretches of beautiful woodland forest over three hours for twenty bucks. There are some nice puzzles on display - supernatural elements play into the game heavily here, all punctuated at the end by a story written by the title character. I assure you it's not an obnoxious Stephen King style 'oooh, the little kid's imagination is special, call the ♥♥♥♥ing Overlook Hotel and ask for Mr. Torrance' plot point. There's variation, but not much of it. At one point, you have the opportunity to play a Splendaman-style (featuring the titular Splendaman character, who is Ryan Gosling of 'Drive' fame sneaking up on housewives to sell them sucralose-based sweetener) 'find the six corpses to unlock the exit' type puzzle, so I hope that all the Youtube Let's Players have bought this to scream in terrified horror at the broken oil lamps or bunnies in broad daylight. The annoying thing is, you have to stop and solve all of the murder mysteries before you can get to the end of the game, which I didn't feel the sting of because I'm the kind of smarty-man detective who worked out the murders as I went along. AND I did the house puzzle without any pen or paper, because I have a wonderful taste for ghost towns and old house layouts. So nyeh.  It's a decent game, but if you don't think it's worth the price, wait for a Steam sale. And do not, under any circumstances, use the comment section to complain about price or I will throw a battery at you.",

            "review_text": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is quite honestly unlike any video game I've ever played before. It really wasn't what I was expecting and it's hard to decribe what I mean by that. It's often bewildering, sometimes strange, but it's always intriguing. Yes ok so it's played from a first person perspectvie and you have walk about looking at stuff to find those all important clues and like any mystery game there are notes and letters just dropped on the ground for the player to discover. Familiar game mechanics? Of course they are, but in this game they do tell a fascinating supernatural story and are definetly not filler or collectibles.  You play the game as Paul Prospero 'a supernatural detective' and I imagine him as a cigar smoking, fedora wearing type not unlike Columbo, but I don't want to put images in your head. Anyway you've been summoned via a handwritten letter to Red Creek Valley by Ethan Carter, a young boy who appears to be in some kind of trouble and it is clear that he is going to need your help and to do that you'll need to don that fedora and do some investigating.  As you examine the clues you find in the game world and interactive with objects Propsero’s inner thoughts are displayed on screen. Subtle clues to help you gather evidence and fit the pieces together. Find the correct order and the events are played back in supernatural film-reel style with a blue filter that act as cut scenes progressing the story.  A point to note is that the game makes it very clear even before you start out on your journey that 'This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand.' That means there are no quest markers, no maps, no golden Fable-esq trail to follow. Just your own noggin to guide you. There are just a few clues to discover in the game world and you must explore, explore and explore. The world is a very beautiful place though and you'll frequently find yourself stopping just to admire the view. It would be unfair to just praise the visuals as the the musical score is equally beautiful, but also subtle and haunting, fitting perfectly with exploration and discovery.  If you are into narrative experiences with lots of exploring required and a thought-provoking backstory to encourage you forward then you will definitely enjoy The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.",

The player has the ability to explore almost every corner of the valley since the beginning, while collecting hints with psychic powers like clairvoyance (clairsentience) and psychometry about the location of a boy who needs the help of the main character and P.I. specialized in supernatural, Paul Prospero.  From beginning to end, the game could be speedrunned quite easily knowing all the location and scenes, and even for the first time some people may finish it with little efforts. For myself was 4-5 hours of gameplay for the first run, and I was surprised a bit. Anyway, with its peculiar *not holding hands* gameplay some aspects like story and exploration may be not so obvious for some people so the gameplay time may differ from player to player.   The game itself, if explored and thinked about has more replay value than a lot games in the market, each time you play it, you may find new things and details missed. Kind of game you wanna show to your friends after you finished it, while giving no spoilers about. It has 2 parts that are quite a surprise, almost a jump-scare, since the game is quite slow-paced to help the player *breathe the air of the valley*.  About the ending, without spoilers, the game could get off-guard some players. Exploration holds the key for most answers, not all!  A must for Myst-loving players and those who want depth in a game without much help for understanding the *truth*. Recommended in general for adventure-games fan and for the Lovecraft-lore addict.

The world manages to be beautiful, whimsical, dark, chilling, and sometimes downright scary. The few puzzles that do pop up are well thought out and logical, so don't go running for a walk-through! Explore, take your time, just when you think you're never going to find anything something pops up that makes the searching worth it. Some reviews say the ending is weird. Personally I think it's perfect, and explains everything.   Now if this were a star rating system, I would give this game a 4 out of 5 and here is why. There are some technical issues that need to be addressed. The only save mechanism is an auto save at the end of each big scene. That was a little frustrating, but I could have accepted it if it were not for the bugs that pop up occasionally, forcing you to reload your last save, and start from square one in each segment.   All in all, barring the technicl issues I really enjoyed this game and would say if you like the genre, dive in!",

Not surprising of course, but everything was cranked up, even 150% resolution scale.  Other than that, it's a good walking simulator with great self-explanatory puzzles, controls and gameplay are intuitive, loading screens are non-existent and environments are gorgeous. The game definitely deserves more positive reviews and I can't possibly understand where all the negative reviews come from.",

            "review_text": "An atmospheric, sometimes scary Lovecraft-esque adventure game with stunning graphics.   Detective games are hard to do, since it is difficult to make the player feel like it is THEY who are performing the deductions/making the inferences. LA Noire and Murdered: Soul Suspect both failed to give the player this feeling, but The Vanishing of Ethan Carter IMO manages to nail it. The 'crime scene chronology' mechanic is fantastic, elegant yet requires the use of your brain to make inferences from the clues. Having to return the scene of the crime back to how it was when the deceased was killed is also a nice touch and makes sense for a 'psychic detective.'  The graphics are frankly gorgeous, although unfortunately the performance isn't as stable as it should be.  The plot is good (although the ending can feel like a bit of an M. Night Shyamalan cop-out-twist-bordering-on-a-deus-ex-machina), the music is very appropriate and fitting, and I enjoyed my time with the game.  The big drawback is the game's length; it can easily be finished in less than four hours.   I'd advise buying the game if you love horror games, adventure/mystery/puzzle games, or just deeply atmospheric games in general. However, you may want to wait for a sale.   The gameplay mechanics for the investigation scenes, however, are excellent, and I hope The Astronauts is planning to make more games like this... if this game is intended as a 'proof of concept' for their idea of how to make a detective game, then I'd say they've proven their concept with flying colors.  PROS: + Best investigation mechanics I've yet encountered in a detective game + Atmospheric + Incredible graphics  CONS: - Brief - Uneven graphical performance  Overall: Fans of horror and/or adventure games should certainly consider purchasing this game.",

The graphics are up there with an ENB-enhanced Skyrim, which is saying a lot. For $20, I highly recommend it.  Thoughts:  For those wondering why I only have .4 hours logged, I have played and beaten it through, other means (make of that what you will) and after beating it, I went and bought it - this game was a no brainer assuming you have the money.  It seems The Astronauts know that regardless of how good a game is, if the game is only a little over 10 hours, you don't charge $50 or $60, I highly respect this since it shows they know and respect their audience.

            "review_text": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter can only be described as an interactive, narrative driven vision of beauty telling a horrific tale that will grip you until the very moment the story ends. From the moment Paul Prospero comes into this world, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter will strike you with its visual beauty and eerie atmosphere. Be it a stain of blood on the ground or a distant sound on the wind, you'll never feel completely safe in Red Creek Valley.  The first thing that came to my mind when I jumped into The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was that it did not look like an Unreal Engine game, especially not Unreal Engine 3. This is a technical achievement all on its own by the developers. The draw distance alone as well as lush environments show that The Astronauts succeeded where many AAA developers failed miserably. Naturally there are no loading screens. Granted, the game requires a pretty powerful PC to run which is where I think the game has its biggest flaw. The game is decently optimized and I personally was getting solid frame-rates in outdoor areas with most of the settings set to High.  Is The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a game? No. Just as with many other 'games' in this not-so-well-defined genre  (like Dear Esther for example)  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter only comes close to being a game during the crime scene investigation... let's call them puzzles. It is a narrative driven experience which focuses on the story and immersing you in the world. It does so very well  because  it doesn't have guns or well defined gameplay mechanics such as skill trees and weapon upgrades. It will tell you it won't hold your hand and this is quite true. This approach means you will have to figure out the mechanics for yourself and you have to do so in order to advance the story.  The crime scene investigation mechanic works in such a way that you have to find and restore objects to their original location and then linking a chain of events together by playing them back in the right order. This is where your supernatural powers come into play. My first experience with the crime scene investigation mechanic was for the most part looking around and clicking on objects it will draw your attention to. The way it does that is by hovering texts above the object in question. When you click on said text it shows you a thought process that in turn gives you clues as to what you are looking for. It is a way of informing you what to do while not ruining the immersion with a HUD notification or by pausing the experience. If only more game developers would take that approach.  Story-wise the game will show you various events that you access through investigating crime scenes. While you can solve each of the mysteries in whichever order you please, the main story doesn't start coming together until you have solved at least half of them. Finding stories left by Ethan in the world will give you an idea of what is really going on and while there is a big twist, I think most people will have realized it long before it actually happens.  If  they payed enough attention to the stories, newspaper cut-outs and other minor clues that are left around in the world for you to find. I would love to give more of an example but the story is hard to write about without giving away major  (or minor)  spoilers. I will say though that the writing is very good, I never had any problems with the dialogue although the voice-acting didn't always fit.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a great addition to my Steam library and while I got it on sale it is  in my opinion  worth the 19 Euros that it currently costs on Steam. I want to see more games like this and I want to see what The Astronauts come up with next.   ",

You don't know who you are or what's going on, well YOU being being the player. The character seems to know fleeting reasons for his investigation into where Ethan has gone. But the ending....the ending completely disrupts and erases all elements of the starting point and throughout. I won't say anytmore, to avoid spoilers, but I completed every part of the map and unlocked the ending movie that was suppose to explain everything and it was a flashback scene that had nothing to do with anything that came before. As if we were watching a different show, with the same named characters.  That said, I still reccomend this game, because maybe I missed something out and if you leave the ending scene out, then everything that comes prior is extremely intriguing, curious, slowly evolving as a somewhat cohesive plot but begs to be wrapped up, Was this an homage to Lovecraftian horror or figments of a childs imaginations? I don't know. I'm frustrated now....  The game is beautiful, absolutely breathaking and though you can traverse from start to end quickly enough (once you've completed all the puzzles), the environment feels huge and alive, yet every area is eerie because of the absence of people. You only encounter the residents when you happen upon their corpses and the rest of the time you see ghosts as you use your powers to construct a magical CSI investation.  The astronaut and witch hunt side quests are optional, but cool.  Play the game, but be prepared for a confusion unfufilled ending. I would actually suggest not even activating it.

It took me 4h to complete it, would probably have taken shorter if they had actually explained how a feature worked, there are no tutorials because 90% of the game doesn't need one. Shame though that the main mechanic thats used really could have done with SOME explanation. Anyway, heres my explanation for it: When you see the cloud of words, look around until they are focused into one word. You will probably understand if you read this sentence when you're ingame. :)  Its a mystery adventure in first person where you investigate, explore and try and sequence together what happened to make the world end up as it did before you arrived. As such it is very slow, there is no action in it whatsoever, you are there as an observer, investigator and solver. As such you cannot die or fail, however you might end up having an area reset or force you to the beginning of the puzzle.  Graphics: Environments are amazing, it looks extremely good and everything just feels correct, which is good since its 95% of the things that you will look at. This is exactly how I expect Half Life 3 forests to look at, it feels like being back in the forests from Episode 2, but just amazing looking. Characters are probably the weakest point, they look lackluster next to the environment.  Sound: Great great music, reminds me of skyrim, beautiful and calm. Voice acting was ok, the player character is clearly the best, would like to have heard more from him. Only iffy about the sound is that the 3d positioning were at times really bad. In one area I had to stand in the middle of the room to hear the ghostly voices at a correct level, and in another place I couldn't position the enormous water source because the sound didn't come from a specific direction. Minor things but kind of odd when playing with headphones.  Technical things: Worked great on my computer, no crashes or anything. Had some annoying stuttering when I moved around and new assets loaded, otherwise the performance was fine on my 780ti. Might just be my SSD that is kind of bad, not a new thing for me. Only encountered one bug that forced me to reload to the latest autosave, kind of annoying but didn't happen anywhere else.  If you feel that 20€ for 4 hours is a bit short you will be missing out on a beautiful game. I really enjoyed it and hope you will too, and that there will come more short games like these.",

It uses far-reaching landscapes and beautiful visual effects to bring you a great narrative experience. However, be warned, this game may not be for those of little patience. __________  Synopsis:  You play as Paul Prospero, who seems to be a detective with paranormal abilities such as ESP. Receiving a letter from Ethan Carter, he learns Ethan has strong psychic connections, and that he has gone missing. Your job is to explore the village of Red Creek Valley and find Ethan. You quickly learn that something is amiss; the town is abandoned, no sign of Ethan's family, and mysterious occurrences.   Story: A short, but interesting tale shrouded in mystery. Perhaps too short, depending on how quickly you progress through the game. It doesn't suffer very much from ups and downs in the story, and it ends pretty well too.   Graphics: One of the most visually appealing games I've played in a long time. A wider, open world gives you plenty of room to stretch your legs and explore, taking in the sights and sounds as you go along.   Functionality: Controls are pretty linear and simple. Essentially a Sherlock Holmes-puzzle solving game. Pick stuff up, find where it goes, and solve problems.   Gameplay: Overall, it's not good. Again, it's basically a point-and-click mystery game akin to Sherlock Holmes. There is no combat mechanics, and every item falls into the one-use category. The real problem I encountered was spending obnoxiously long amounts of time searching the vast landscape for potential clues, which a majority of them felt arbitrary. This is where those of little patience may find the game frustrating. ______________________________  At the end of the day, you're buying this game for the story and the experience; but the experience tends to fall short when you're slowly crawling over a couple acres of land looking for that one last piece of the puzzle. I feel this may have been a better release under a different venue, like Heavy Rain, which offers great atmosphere, narritive, and incorporates at least DECENT gameplay elements.

When all you are doing is invtestigating things, it's nice when they are pretty to look at. I still can't get over how beautiful this game is.   The story is well crafted as well, although it isn't the longest, the puzzels and drive to figure out what is going on is well worth it. I believe it took me about 6-8 hours of actual play time to beat this game (admitadly, some of the play time was just looking at the gogeous landscape and map haha). I've left it paused so my record states ~30 hours.   Some say that this game isn't worth $20 for the amount of playtime you get. Normally, I'd agree in saying 5-8 playing hours isn't worth $20. However, this developer's passion and integrity are very apparent. It's obvious a lot of blood, sweat and tears were put in by the devs of this game. I loved the game and I'm happy to support them by paying a slightly high, but reasonable price for this game. Hope to see more from these guys.",

However the intersting crime solving mechanic devolves after the first two and stops being an exercise in observation and ellimination, which was incredibly satisfying, and instead becomes very linear.

Great visuals, great story, very intelligent puzzle solving situations, great atmosphere and nice mechanics. Think Alan Wake, Gone Home and Dear Esther wrapped into one, but handled much better than the afore mentioned. It is fairly short and can be completed very quickly, but it is a good ride while it lasts.  If you're looking for a good story, a great sense of creeping horror and a game that treats its audience like intelligent people, then pick this up in a heart beat.",

There no feeling of 'ah now I HAVE to go do this' and as a result you want to discover and explore.  I dont want to post any spoilers, so all I will say is I was a bit dissapointed with how the game ends, not the story or the way it ends, just that it ends and I was left without closure in the sense of finishing a game, again not the story or the way it ends.

            "review_text": " In Brief  Somewhere between walk-'em-up and adventure game,  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter  blends the best elements of both.   Most valuable resource:  The atmosphere.  Of interest to:  people who like their walk-'em-ups with just a tad more gameplay.   The Vanishing of Ethan Carter  received a lot of buzz in the indie-sphere, and rightly so. It also has its detractors, and I can understand why. There is just enough game here for it to be unequivocally a game, unlike other narrative-driven walking simulators like  Dear Esther  and  Gone Home  and thus, like  Eidolon  - another gamified stroller - Ethan Carter left itself open to criticism focusing only on the game elements.  Now don't get me wrong, the game elements here are brilliant. You are a supernatural investigator who stumbles across murder victims, hunts for clues using your psychic sense, assembles them, then gets to see little still poses of the victim and their murderer assembled around the scene. By tagging them in the correct chronological order, you get to view a cutscene that explains what happened. This denouement is masterfully done. The process of stumbling across and then piecing together all the elements of the crime is entertaining, and doesn't break your immersion in the tense atmosphere the game is building by forcing you to involve yourself in mindless tasks or fiddly interfaces.  But while these murders drive the narrative, the crime scene investigation definitely plays second fiddle to you just walking around this town. I think the balance is just right, but for those who like more game in their game, the short running time combined with the few instances of this interesting mechanic equals not much game. And I think that's a real shame, because the beauty of this game is in the way it artfully places you in a plausible scenario dealing with increasingly implausible elements that all have such gravity because the scene, the mood, the atmosphere are all so engrossing and so foreboding.  The one criticism I do have is that that one wonderful mechanic is not explained. It is barely referenced that you have this extra sense, and how your window on the past expands by assembling clues is never mentioned at all. It doesn't help that the very first scene you encounter, the one where your powers are introduced, is completely atypical, lacking a body or any clues to assemble, and using a different visual to literally every other instance of the sense that occurs the entire duration of the game. As far as communicating mechanics organically through gameplay goes, that's a cardinal sin. I feel like the developers have heard this complaint before, and have inserted a warning up-front that the game does not hand-hold as a defence against this criticism, but if you find your players are googling 'ethan carter touch not working' so frequently that google autocompletes the search three words in you've not communicated well enough. And that's a real shame, because having to backtrack to redo the puzzles you didn't realise were puzzles kinda breaks the flow of the narrative and takes you out of the game.   I do want to especially call out the jump scare section. Ethan Carter is that rarest of beasts: a horror(-ish) game with an effective and appropriate jump scare. Half way through the game, when the tension has been built and you're starting to get a sense that these are more than just mundane murders, this terrifying section comes out of nowhere, with no warning, and is genuinely terrifying. Not just shocking or unexpected, but  dreadful . The fact that this section was managed so well is all you need to know to be sure that the whole game is subtle and intelligent and very expertly crafted as an experience.  And it's beautiful, as all walk-'em-ups must be. Unlike  Mind: Path to Thalamus 's saturated surreality,  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter  is delicate, and wistful, and melancholic, but every inch as artistically gorgeous. Take frequent scenic screenshots and you will be set for desktop wallpapers for a good long time.  As a piece of Innsmouth writing, it is utterly on-pitch in its length and narrative progression. If you're a fan of the understated horror of actual Lovecraft, rather than the Cthulu monsterism that has taken over the horror genre, this is a perfect experience for you. It's not a long game, but it is exactly the right length.  That said, I do hope there will be a sequel. The set-up in terms of mechanics and theme here makes that perfectly possible, and it would be a real shame if we didn't get to play with this system again.",

It offers no real replay value - while the story is presented in a non-linear manner where the only puzzle you need to complete before the others is all the puzzles before the last one, there is no variation. Only one solution for any given puzzle, and all puzzles must be completed to finish, leading to a sense of guide dangit if you bypass one of the early ones, which could be easy to do if you weren't coming the land. If you can tolerate a short and linear game for a vivid experience, I'd recommend it.  That is the only major complaint I have with the game - the plot is very good with an excellent ending, the narrator is pleasing to listen to ( although not as good as a Bastion ), the environments are fairly detailed with a sprinkling of places you can't enter as part of the plot railroad. The soundtrack is great, and the sound work is just as good. The graphics, while not the best in the world, are very well done and sell the setting.  The main puzzles are fairly simple, but interesting - you will be attempting to solve murders of people and must track down each clue before you enter a timeline where the events must be placed in the correct order ( which can lead to some guesswork as not all are clear until you get it wrong the first time ). The side missions are more varied - you chase an astronaut and go into space, you must navigate a house where all the doorways have portals in them, making them line up correctly to reach the wizard's protected room, and a few others.  If the developers were to release a TellTale-type chapters game following the mentioned but unelaborated previous cases of the player, Paul Prospero, I'd be all over that in a heartbeat, but the experience itself is worth a few bucks - certainly as much as you'd pay for a visual novel or light book - but not quite 10 dollars - once it reaches the 5 dollar mark it becomes worth it.",

This game does not have a lot of game to it, and is very much a narrative focused experience, which I'm a huge fan of. The music really sets the tone together with the very high quality graphics and beautiful, well-crafted environments with immense mountains and lush forests. I especially liked the timing of the music, which really set the tone just right for every part of the world.  By solving puzzles you unravel a series of very mysterious and macabre tales in the world. The puzzles aren't very difficult, but finding out what the puzzle actually is is a lot more challenging. I somehow managed to skip the first 2 puzzles and just walked straight by them, only to complete them at the end. I was simply not aware of the fact that those were puzzles. The game can feel a bit pretentious with its whole 'not holding hands' at times, and can scare away newcomers to games. Other criticism I have is that, while the story is nicely told, it's not in every part of it. The character art, voice over and development really pales compared to the setting making it very hard to empathise with them. Furthermore, there are some very cheap jumpscares in the game that I thought were utterly unnecessary, and in adventure games I nearly always find inexcusable.   In the end the story itself also doesn't have much of a lasting appeal even when so masterfully told, which is a problem I have with most of the games in the genre. It's however probably still my favourite game of 2014, and a huge recommendation.  I'm feeling a light to a decent 8.",

The game draws some limited inspiration from Lovecraft, but not too much. Both the game's tone and visuals remind me of Dear Esther, but with a real plot and puzzles.   Unfortunately the game does rely on an abudance of exploration to find all the clues--which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if the map wasn't as large and linear (taking a LONG time to walk to the other side of the map). Some plot elements are placed well off the main pathways and can require a keen eye (and luck) to discern.   On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give this game around a 7. Visually, it is stunning. The story unfolds in a compelling manner and MOST of the puzzles are fair and help push the narrative. Unfortunately some puzzles are too simple, while one in particular can be extremely difficult and is not coherently presented within the narrative. It is a short game, but well worth picking up. If you have a GPU capable of running the Redux version, don't even bother with the 'original' game.   FWIW, I found the game's conclusion to be satisfying--YMMV.  Pros: Beautiful graphics (Redux version) Interesting plot Nice soundtrack  Cons: Some critical data is located far off the obvious pathways. At least one 'puzzle' (house portals) is not presented logically within the plot and can be dificult to discern what is required. The map is fairly huge and can require time consuming trips from one end to the other if you missed something (which is likely). ",

The game crafts a rich atmosphere that feels very considered. As it turned out there's a reason for the detective's manner of speaking that is part of the story but that is in spoiler territory as to why. The rest of the writing and voice acting is superb (especially Ethan's).  I like to call the game a supernatural, first-person, narrative-driven, detective adventure game. The environments are like nothing you've seen in a game before. Despite how well they're crafted they took extra care to make it 'feel' real with wind through the grass and trees and leaves blowing in the breeze. At the same time, the environment is completely devoid of people and animals (except for the puzzles) which makes it feel lonely and a little creepy and sinister. I would've liked to see a few animals like birds to add to the realism but not too many to detract from the general vibe. I highly recommend playing this game at night with either good speakers or headphones to experience the atmosphere to its fullest.  The puzzles mostly revolve around establishing the sequence of events of various murders you find around the game. On one occasion I had to consult a guide to understand why I couldn't solve it (the hidden room puzzle) but once I figured out that there were options I wasn't seeing it was easy enough. If I had any criticism here I'd say the game can feel a bit 'walking simulator' at times, but with visuals this good I didn't mind that much. On a technical level I noticed the standard version of the game was fairly jerky on my laptop but the remastered version played smoothly, so best to stick with the update.  I'd say it’s a 4 to 5-hour game at normal pace, more for intrepid explorers, wanderers or the snap-happy and less for the 'efficient' or impatient. Sure you could watch a play through on YouTube but you'd be denying yourself the full experience of one of the truly great indie games in recent years. The ending was truly cinematic and a beautiful conclusion to this amazing gem. It left me feeling like I'd experienced something genuinely hand-crafted, original and filled with love and care, just the way a fine film does.  I feel with this game they bit off just as much as they could chew, preferring a polished quality experience than to drag on or deliver more of a game that is incomplete or rough around the edges and I always prefer it this way. This game is indie gold and I can't wait to see what's next for the cool guys at The Astronauts.",

Apparantly there's no right or wrong way to play this game however i missed the opening crime scene (railcar) and proceeded onto the 2nd before going back to the 1st and for whatever reason the scene with the railcar wouldn't play out properly.....can't say too much. I'm thinking this was just a glitch and was just bad luck on behalf so i stated from the beginning and this time it all went smoothly.  I played the redux version and the graphics are stunning, the sound is atmospheric and the music haunting. The game has a strong narative so if you looking at the Steam winter sale and thinking i fancy something a bit different i would not hesitate in giving Ethan carter a go, you won't regret it.  I think i got about 8-9 hours gameplay out of this title but I would say 1-2 hours of that was trying to close out some achievements and man the unfinished story achievement is a toughy.

This game does come with some cons though. - It's very short. If I hadn't gotten this on 50% sale, I'd been dissapointed - though a good 9 seems to be a fair price to me. - The ending is a plot twist, mostly because of how cliche it is. I didn't like it at all, and I'd definitely like to rant about it, but that would spoil it. It drew similarities to a Twillight plot device, along with plot devices used by all sorts of rookie storytellers, let's put it like that. Luckily, this 'end' lasts about 5 minutes tops, so it's not great loss. Note: The end does make sense though, and does tie all the loose ends together - and even then I'd still think it better had the loose ends not been tied up. - In the beginning, it said it wouldn't hold my hands, so I thought the game would be difficult. It wasn't. It wasn't at all. At least not to me. I see others disagreeing with me, saying you 'might miss something', and granted, I didn't get 100% of all achievements...

            "review_text": "I'm certain that there are quite a few people who will call The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a boring and pointless walking simulator. Well, they are partially correct.  The Vanishing is not exactly what I would call a game. It's more like... an experience. If I had to name a similar “game”, it would be Dear Esther.  Don't expect to run around and kill things here. What you will do is walk around and investigate the disappearance of a boy called Ethan Carter. You will solve some puzzles, find some 'hidden' objects etc. Now... I'm not sure, but it may be possible to “finish” the game without solving anything, so far I have looked into every corner of the Valley I laid my eyes upon, found a few “secrets”, solved every puzzle and I'm not done yet, though I guess I'm not far now from the end.  The game has absolutely phenomenal atmosphere. There is a sense of calmness but also you have a feeling that something is not right, and it might not be a good idea to stick around. That atmosphere is built by impossibly pretty visuals. Graphics are... let's just say: I made quite a few wallpapers for myself during very first minutes of the game. Apart from visuals the sound is also 1st class. Ambient sounds of the forest are very realistic, other places have their own specific ambiance. Also music fits the game perfectly: it is there, you are aware of it, but it's not too intrusive. Also it changes depending on your location. And there is the voice acting. The main character is perfectly calm, a bit bored detective who just wants to finish the job and go home. Other characters are voiced maybe not as well, but still I can't complain.  Overall visuals and sounds are great.  As for not so grand things: Save system is not good. Auto saves are rare and far between, there is no manual save, if you exit the game you loose everything since last save, and sometimes it's not easy to know if you will loose 2 minutes or half an hour. That being said, Game now downloads a patch that is going to improve that, so this point may not be very valid.  And... well, that's it really.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not a long game that should be treated as an experience rather than an adventure. Fans of Dear Esther will love it. Fans of Call of Duty... won't. I'm the former.",

With regards to the 'save point' issues I read about, I EXPERIENCED NONE. As for the story, if you choose to take the story events at surface value you may have a negative experience, but I implore you to search the story for the deepest implications it could have and hopefully this work will leave you content at the very least.   Pros: + Amazing Graphical Style + Beautiful Soundtrack + In-depth Story + Decent/Good Voice-acting + Intuitive Game Mechanics + Puzzle Quality; Hard enough usually to make you think for a second but generally not hard enough to cause frustration + Environmental Exploration Opportunities  Cons: - Skipping over puzzle locations can lead to the need for back-tracking, which some may find frustrating - Dialogue sometimes cuts short if you leave from a 'scene' area too quickly (rare occurrence) - Environmental Audio Transitions; on occassion environmental sound transitions are too abrupt (an example, would be standing in a doorway and hearing no sound from a nearby waterfall and then hearing it roar the moment you exit the doorway) - Lack of combat for those that appeals to - Somewhat short with around 5 hours of playtime  ***PURCHASING/AVOIDING POINTS***  ***ABSOLUTE must-buy if looking for a quality game with a reasonable price-tag*** ***AVOID if walking through the environment to find areas of interest bores you as you will have to do this some***  I absolutely recommend this game and to those who play it, enjoy the ride.",

Just keep in mind that my total time playing was about 3 hours, and that was with going back through the environment to see things I may have missed.  The gameplay is interesting. It's a puzzler and you're the non-violent party, with plenty of violent scenes around you to resolve. The first, or some may say second, puzzle is the most complicated of them, but it sets a pattern that can be readily followed. (The first 'insight' is more of a exploration.)   This follows in the path of Alan Wake, but with a story heavy, non-violent approach. It tells a story and tells it beautifully in a series of framed situations. There are some gristly and frightening situations, but it definitely a puzzler, not a survival horror. You'll get a chance to review and act on puzzles you didn't get to unlock the ending.  The weakest part of this game ends up being the acting for the English voiceovers, unfortunately. There were good spots with your character, but I think either by subduing the audio a bit or by framing the situations better for the actors, it would have meshed better.

Pierced through the heart by the harpoon of mystery and dragged beneath the turbulent waters of unfathomable horror, and I enjoyed every white-knuckled second of it. I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but from what I can say about the story, the protagonist, Paul Prospero emerges from a tunnel, through a portal into Red Creek Valley, and things just get weirder from there. While I'm not one to gush about visuals and atmosphere of a game, this particular game manages to take superlativeness to a whole new level when it comes to looks and atmosphere.  The setting, the fine details had me on my toes literally from the first minute, and had me asking a lot of questions come the end of the first 'sensory' scene. The kinds of questions that gnaw at your sense of comfort and stability, eat away at your confidence in the mundanity of reality. I particularly loved the way the game handles its doses of startle and fright, getting the dosage in that sweet spot that makes your stomach backflip whenever you hear the strings twang or the sound of an otherworldly moan. One little segment of the game in particular scared me in a way I haven't been since the original STALKER, and to a far better degree might I add. Until today I have never dreaded the thought of being in a cave underground as much as I do now. I am scarred for life and I have never enjoyed the experience more.  There are only two drawbacks to this game that I can think of: The first is its length. Entirely forgivable given the amount of work that has clearly gone into making the game. The second is the way the game's progression can be obfuscated at times. While a horror game is rarely enhanced by extra degrees of handholding, surely a game with such wonderfully written narration and oodles of interleaved details in all of its backstory could tell us how to use Paul's abilities through his own words, and maybe, just maybe, make a few of the more difficult items/doors/buttons/etc. a teensy bit easier to find?  But other than those two tiny things I have yet to enjoy a single horror game more than I've enjoyed this interactive story. Worth every penny you pay for it.",

The graphics are excellent (have to state I run a high end games machine).  There aren't any instructions with the game, you have to find your own way. However, there are suggestions which can't be missed and also thoughts of the detective (you) appear from time to time which helps. Paths can be followed and progress can be made meandering through rocks on occasion, but if there isn't a way forward motion completely stops. The background music is mainly quiet and orchestral - it fits the game really well and adds greatly to the rather creepy/sinister atmosphere. The only point I would question is the autosave as the game progresses. These don't appear to occur very regularly and consequently if the game is left it can be that a considerable amount of the journey already completed has to be re-done. Perhaps it would have been better if the programmers had built in a save function for the player to activate? Then again, perhaps there is more to achieve before the next save can be made. Overall the game is excellent. It is the opposite of the 'point a gun and walk about shooting people' kind of game. Recommended without hesitation.",

I wish i could spend more time exploring more of the town, getting to know its inhabitants, solving more puzzles, hiking through the forest. I beat the game in 4hrs.  2. This game doesnt guide you in any form.  There is no tutorial, there are no hints, there are no waypoints, there is no map, you dont have an inventory. You figure it out all by yourself. Which at times leaves you wondering off aimelessly through the woods.  In the end, I enjoyed it. I like how the story evolves out of the puzzles you have to solve. Its something new and different but if you like to be lead by the hand or told what to do next, then youll get frustrated. Graphically, this game is amazing to look at and would wander endlessly if they allowed me to. This is a one-and-done title as there is no replay value at all, the story seems to suggest other stories and hopefully more come out, hopefully longer and with some replay value.",

This game is the most beautiful game I have seen yet so far and the atmosphere is absolutely stunning with it's graphic combined with gameplay, open world and fitting music.   The story is a mysterious, crimesolving and thriller like genre and with your supernatural detective skills you must solve the case of the kid Ethan who's gone missing without any visable signs at first. You soon encounter some dark and creepy scenarios and while you try to solve the case you become more and more dragged into something you dont understand at first.   The game does not help you with many clues and even though it's not the hardest game the openworld and the gorgeous graphic makes you just wander around sometimes wondering what to do. The puzzle part is quite enjoyable and creative and even though it's not that many obsticles it's fun to play through atleast once or twice.  If you have a couple of hours to spare and like storytelling games with good scenarios, atmosphere and great music I suggest you should check this out :)",

            "review_text": "Short but sweet.  Using a minimalist approach The Vanishing of Ethan Carter can take off the numerous training wheels common in game design today such as nav beacons and HUD while still remaining brief and effective. Good writing makes the story worth following and interesting to unravel.  Mechanically it's closer to games like Myst or Robot City than Dear Esther for all its brevity because The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is actually a game like Robot City and Myst and not a pile of bad prose shoved down unwitting players' throats like Dear Esther. The puzzle mechanics are straightforward and interesting, not rocket science but not condescending either. The usual question at the heart of each one is 'how did these things come to be as they are now?' and it reinforces the thematic importance of imagination as escape from the quotidian. What looks at first like an abandoned town turns out to be more, then more again.  I was frankly amazed at how their techniques managed to yield such impressive results in the aging Unreal 3 engine. There are very few moving objects in the game but the world as a whole is incredibly detailed in a deliberate fashion. Art direction ties well into the macabre mechanics involved in reconstructing various characters' personal histories and the sense of a day frozen near magic hour is both visually stunning and a massively important plot point. It really does feel like every piece of the game fits in a larger sense.  The only mechanical gripe I have is the lack of manual saves. I recommend switching to the Polish audio with English subtitles. The voice actors just seem to deliver their lines with a more natural sense of conviction in Polish.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter won't resolve the 'length versus quality' debate but it does put a solid marker in the 'short but well done can be worthwhile' camp.  Give it a look if you like first-person exploration-oriented puzzle games or just interesting experiments in design backed up by solid execution.",

They don't waste your time with a tutorial (you've played video games before, figure it out), and there's really only one button to interact with the world. The investigation stuff and puzzles aren't very hard, but they are pretty unique. This game is more about story-telling than making you struggle through challenges. The atmosphere of the whole game is excellent, and the soundtrack backs it up very well. Overall, an increbily polished game that's entertaining to play and has a cool story.

Fortunately the graphics are beautiful and create an interesting atmosphere.  It's a relatively new kind of genre - an exploration adventure, similar to 'Gone Home'. You explore the world and solve a number of relatively easy puzzles while soaking in the sights and sounds. If you've played adventure games in the 90s then you're probably overqualified when it comes to puzzle-solving. Still entertaining though.  The story is a neat little supernatural mystery. It wouldn't really stand on its own (like as a book), but fortunately it doesn't have to. The atmosphere is achieved through well-matched graphics style, sound and little stories. There's a kind of horror that relies on atmosphere rather than jump-scares - for the most part at least. It makes the game more interesting and engaging rather than making you too scared to play it. Except for one part which might get a tiny bit uncomfortable and seems a bit out of place.  Technically the game is quite solid. The graphics are basically spotless (photographed textures, skillfully put together). Unfortunately Eyefinity/Surround doesn't work out of the box, which would have been nice for people with 3 screens. Also I don't like it when first-person games don't show your legs/feet. Player movement is very basic - you can walk or run and whenever you get to a steep slope / water / any place that might get you hurt, you bumb into an invisible wall. I haven't experienced any bugs.  The one problem with the design is the save system. I won't spoil anything by telling you that the game is made up of a few puzzles / murder mysteries strewn across the world, with each puzzle occupying a very small area. The game only remembers whether you completed a puzzle or not - incomplete puzzles will not be saved! Remember that when you temporarily give up on one puzzle and move on to the next.  I bought the game when it was on sale, like 9€ or so. That was a fair price for the experience, and I hope to discover more games like it.",

Honestly, this is the only game in my knowledge where I can feel anxiety by simply staring at a waterfall. Where most horror games instill a fear of what is to come, this game focuses on the gruesome mystery of what has already happened, heavily relying on the player’s own imagination. Feelings of fear and wonder will combine to create an aura of anxiety, present throughout.   The plot is all over the place. It’s fairly experimental and nonlinear, but poetically satisfying. It’s not the type of game that needs to be played in one sitting.   The music sounds like someone threw a million dollars at it. The different tracks are fairly catchy too, and they support their visual environments.  There are a few cons to this game. Maneuvering around can be a bit choppy. The voice acting is adequate but not amazing. The save system is automatic and too infrequent. There are a few typos, and the transposition of the audible dialogue to the text on screen is not always perfect.

The game is about finding a young boy, Ethan Carter. There is no hand holding in the game, it even tells you that at the start. You are plopped down in the world and let loose to do what you will. Exploration is the big thing. There is no shooting or fighting or jumping. You cannot die. If I were to compare it to another game, I'd say it is like Myst, but with less puzzles and a darker story. It is definitely creepy at times. A bit like how Alan Wake is. The murder solving aspects are pretty cool, but they are not very challenging. I liked the story, it was original and it has a cool ending. The game is short, around 4 hours. Honestly I wish it was longer because it was really fun to explore. I'm really looking forward to whatever The Astronauts make next!  Pros: -Gorgeous game! Fantastic graphics! Very immersive world. -Pretty cool story. Original idea and it had a cool ending. -Easy to play and really fun to explore. -Dark undertones with some HP Lovecraft flavor. -A bit like Myst and Alan Wake, but with no shooting -Putting the crime scenes together is a unique idea and I enjoyed it.  Cons: -Since you are just free to go where you want, I ended up having to do some back tracking at the end of the game to complete everything. Which was a bit annoying. -I wanted more challenging puzzles. Everything is pretty easy to solve. I don't know if I'd even call them puzzles. In comparison, Myst is more challenging when it comes to puzzles. -Pretty short game, maybe 4 hours. I wish it was longer because it was really enjoyable to explore.  So, if you like games like Myst mixed with an Alan Wake vibe, you would like this! More like Myst though. I highly recommend it!",

It's got a somewhat long learning curve, if you're not used to this type of game, but the content is astonishing : You find yourself in a gorgeous open-world scenery (UE3 and UE4-redux version DO make a difference), where you explore and find clues that help you pick up the pieces of the story at your own pace. The graphics are absolutely beautiful and so is the subtle ambient music score that will accompany you to some very memorable locations. The whole scenario, although short, is well written and makes for some gory, dark sense in the process. It's not a lengthy experience, but it's long enough to support the script without falling into unnecessary scenario gaps.

Pros:  Absolutly beautiful - I never got bored with running around aimlessly when I got stuck because there was so much to look at.  Interesting puzzle mechanics - The main puzzles were fun since you not only had to find/move objects but then decide the order of events. The game also mixes in other puzzles like having to remember the layout of house as you pass through portals, figuring out the correct letters of a name to unlock a door by running around and inspecting dead bodies while avoiding a creepy zombie guy.  Engaging story - You get to see things from the view point of Ethans stories as well as the reality of what inspired the boy to write the stories to begin with. It has a very dark undertone but fits with the vast open world. The ending was sad but very touching.  Music - very soothing at times but creepy at others. All the tracks fit their respective events/areas.  Acheivements - From what I've read the developers were against putting in acheievments before? Not sure why considering I found them helpful. I don't really like the idea of getting all the way to the end just to find out you missed a ton of events that you needed to trigger. So they helped motivate me to explore more and look more carefully. Plus there were a few that made me explore and try doing random things that I wouldn't have normally done - like The Tunnel    Cons:  Buggy - very very buggy. The game froze on me twice when I accidently double clicked while inspecting an item/body. I had to quit and go back into the game after door to the building with the dam pumps wouldn't open (with me stuck inside.) Speaking of quitting to restart - because there is not save option you loose any progress if the game doesn't auto save. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if when you quit the game didn't actually reset. I ended up back near the beginning a couple of times after dealing with the game freezing or bugging out and was very confused when everything I had done in previous puzzles was reset. Also, if you didn't ride the elevator up from the lower area then you'll have to run through the mines all over again to get back down.",

Right away I was finding things that I simply strolled past without a second glance. You have to be meticulous to really enjoy this game which was a bit of a downside, but, the payoff for finding every single thing the game has to offer is well worth it. The game, despite being called horror is not very scary. There was only one part that was genuinely scary but it was very brief. Eerie is probably a better word for this game but it gets quite graphic at times. The ending was really well done, albeit a bit sad, but it does a fantastic job of making you think without it being too confusing. This game is short but well worth the $20 and even if you dont want to go through the trouble of beating it, I would reccomend watching a playthrough because the storytelling is really fantastic. 9/10",

The music is very well done, not too much and blends well with the mood and surroundings to help lend another layer to the whole experience. The exploration element is very reminiscent of the Myst games but here you have a little more structure to the way in which the clues are pieced together to further the narrative. The main story is supplemented with some very interesting asides, you don't need to do them, but why wouldn't you want explore all of the valley and uncover its' mysteries? My one and only criticsm is that there is not enough of it, so is that a criticsm to say that I want more of this. Probably not, can't wait for more along the same lines from this developer.

I don't like horror games, and while this game isn't scary per se ('uneasy' would be a better term), there is one specific section that features jump scares, which I wasn't too happy about, and honestly kinda breaks the flow/feel of the game.

The world in this game is so beautiful, I would happily have bought it just for the exploration. There is a lot more to it, however.

Making a game that survives on grindy gameplay or balls-to-the-wall action is easy by comparison; you've got an addicting element or two that you can exploit, slap some pretty colors on it, and make a swell profit. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is much classier than that. It wants to tell a chilling story, but it doesn't want to hold your hand. It knows that you can figure things out with enough time and the proper perspective. The controls aren't complex, and the atmosphere seems to almost set itself: a destitute countryside with an air of age and decay, hinting to something sinister beneath the rock.  You play Paul Prospero, a paranormal investigator, who'd been sent a grave letter from a boy who feared dark forces were consuming his family. From that brief explanation on, you are free to explore the world at your leisure, piece together clues to solve mysteries, or simply follow the tracks the game has set up for you.   As one might expect, the strongest suit of the game is its story, which takes very clear inspiration from the works of HP Lovecraft, and perhaps a bit from The Twilight Zone. The serene beauty of the game also achieves a sense of immersion while you're adventuring across the countryside, and it completely amplifies this chilling sensation of 'relaxed horror', as I like to call it --horror that lacks jumpscares and moments of fear, which are popular in games like Five Nights at Freddy's . (Though I'll let you know, there is a pop-scare or two that you might not be expecting, but they're quite mild).  If I had to call out a few weaknesses, I'd say the puzzles are tremendously easy, and the game is actually rather short, despite the satisfying story. This is counterbalanced by its lovely $20 pricetag, which stunned me considering how beautiful the game looks. There are plenty of new triple-A games out in the market with roughly the same amount of gameplay time, but three times the price (I'm looking at you, The Order 1886).  All in all, if you're even a remote fan of horror and puzzle-games, buy it. It's a relaxing, pleasant experience. It's got some cleverness to the puzzles, and it gets you invested in a simple, but surprisingly clever, yet bitter-sweet, story. For $20, that's a steal by most of today's standards.",

Graphics -&gt; Ethan Carter; this game is astonishingly gorgious at times, although the character models and animations are not as good as the landscape. All in all this might me the best looking game after GTA5 I have ever played. Music -&gt; Dear Esther; EC has some great tunes but Jessica Curry's haunting tunes seem to be in a league of their own... I rarely experienced music that tore more at the heartstrings than Dear Esther's. Voice acting -&gt; Dear Esther; EC's main character Paul Prospero's sounds great, but all the other characters are less convincing. 'Gameplay' -&gt; Ethan Carter; this games actually has some puzzles and even a point at which you can *gasp* DIE! Atmosphere -&gt; Dear Esther; Ethan Carter is beautiful, but lacks the melancholy soul Dear Esther presents. Basically Dear Esther's island is one big metaphore for your journey, while EC's woods and hills are seemingly just that: (beautiful) woods and hills. Mystery -&gt; Dear Esther; while both games have plenty of mysterious events and settings and good stories, EC has a pretty nice wrap-up in the end where most has been explained. Dear Esther remains ambiguous even after several playthroughs, which I like more. Emotional impact -&gt; Dear Esther; it basically wins because the overal presentation including music and writing is a more poetic experience; it thus affected me more than EC, although the ending of EC is also a really good one.  So once again: recommended, but not able to become my favourite 'walking game' after Dear Esther.",

Put simply, this isn't a game, it's an experience. Like walking through a book that you just can't put down. And It's one I hope to visit again, once the memory of the story fades and the puzzles solutions are lost to me. Highly recommended and I will personally be hoping for more from the developer in the future.",

There is not that much in convensional gameplay per say, the puzzles are few and very easy and it's mostly walking in very pretty (but bleak) enviroments. But that is not a bad thing as long as you are prepared for it. This is what 'walking simulators' should try to be. It's a short game, but well worth playing. You are really missing out on something special if you don't play it.",

            "review_text": "When I first stumbled upon this game and watched the trailers, I thought this game was worth a try. Now that I have played it, I'm convinced that this is a masterpiece. It isn't action-packed, nor it is trying to challenge your abilities, it's simply trying to tell a story. And that it does well.  Once in the game, the first thing you'll definitely notice is the graphics. It's simply beautiful. Combine it with the atmospheric soundtrack, and you get yourself an experience you'll remember, feeling like you're actually a part of the world.  Now, about starting the game... You'll have to figure out how to play. There's no tutorial of any kind. The game starts, and you'll be standing on the (rail)road without any hints or quest markers. In fact, I'd say there are no quests at all. But don't blame the developers for being lazy. All of these things are intentional. The game is not about solving quest or beating a boss. It's about exploring and puzzle solving. It's about discovering the secrets of Red Creek Valley. And there  are  a few of those.  If you still don't fancy starting the game without some explanation about the game's mechanics, there's a commented gameplay video (with some light spoilers) on the game's Steam Store page that should have more than enough details to get started.  In general, the game is pretty simple. The interactions, the puzzles, the crime scenes - Nothing is too complicated. The reason behind is that the main focus is neither of these things. Instead, the emphasis is on the world and the story. This results in the game being surprisingly immersive and everything just feeling alive, despite the main character being the only living person in the vast majority of the game.  Though the amount of content, combined with the overall simplicity, has another side effect: short playtime. You can get from the intro sequence to the end credits in a few hours. Don't let that discourage you, though. Sometimes, ignoring the story and aimlessly wandering the forests of the valley can give you an experience that feels strangely satisfying. And if you want to rush through the game... Don't. It's okay for your second playthrough, but the first time is unique. Do it in a rash, and disappointment is pretty much guaranteed. Instead, take your time. Nothing's chasing you. Go in a pace that's comfortable for you. And live the game yourself.  Overall, I'd say that the Disappearance of Ethan Carter is a well-made, well thought-out game. It's interesting, chilling and fascinating at the same time. I'd recommend it to anyone who   Likes a game with a good story   Actually plays games for the story   Likes mysteries and the supernatural  I DON'T recommend the game if   You're looking for a challenge   You're looking for action   You can't handle something that has an obscure or secondary meaning  If you do decide to play the game, get ready for an experience that could potentially have a permanent emotional impact on you.   The final scene will hit you like a brick.  ",

            "review_text": "Amazing game with brilliant graphics, was a ton of fun to play through. I like to think that I'm pretty good at solving puzzles myself, and have played/read Professor Layton, Sherlock Holmes, etc. for most of my life, but The Vanishing of Ethan Carter took being a detective in a game to a whole different level.  A few quick things about the game, and then you can be on your way: -This is not an action game. There is no shooting, ducking behind cover while the building you just escaped explodes, or anything like that. It's more ambient and thought-provoking, making you think about how to solve /this/ puzzle, how /this/ from earlier might've tied into /this/ part, etc. (in fairness, there is 1 grenade in the game, but you don't throw it at anyone/thing) -Takes about 6-8 hourse of gameplay to beat the main story, assuming you look up the occasional guide for when you get stuck/confused (happens more often then you might think, trust me). Probably longer than that if you don't use any guides, but I wouldn't know. -One of the puzzles involves a cursed miner who wanders around an abandoned mineshaft. This part is reminiscent of those jump-scare games that famous youtubers play and MatPat does game theories about. If you're a wimp like me and don't like that kind of thing, it's fairly easy to just sprint through most of it and, using a guide, figure out the code you need to put in at the end of the puzzle. If not, you can just go for it. Or you can just go for it either way, don't let me tell you how to live your life.  And that's pretty much all I have to say.  TL;DR, it's an ambient mystery game, has a short-medium length story-line, and has one part that's kinda creepy (though I haven't played enough of that kind of game to judge very well). Anyway it's a great game, pulls you in very effectively, is lots of fun, and even has a plot-twist or two thrown in there as a bonus. Definitely worth the money.",

            "review_text": "In a time where a game presenting itself as a 'narrative-driven experience' more than often leads to the uncomfortable premonition that you're in for a ride with the PC's version of a lethally boring and pretentious arthouse movie, The Vanishing of Ethan does all the right things to tell a story that actually keeps you thrilled until the last second.  On the surface, TVoEC plays like an interactive detective story - you find a corpse, seek for the most plausible cause of death, and collect evidence to create a theory of what happened. Slightly more unusual, the protagonist Paul Prospero has some sort of second-sight which allows him to have a flashback of the murder scene if he repositions certain objects the way they were before the murder. Together with these flashbacks, small bits of written text from Ethan himself help to advance the story.  'Advance' may not quite be the right word here, though. While there is some progress in the story, the game developers actually got the 'Mystery' part right - you quickly develop a plausible idea of what happened to Ethan and his family, but the longer you play, the more cracks this formerly so obvious truth gets. Not all things are quite as they seem.  Being a narrative-driven game, TVoEC's gameplay sadly is a bit lackluster. While the world looks gorgeous thanks to the UE4 engine and has some fantastic background music, what you actually do inside it rather repetive, with most ridddles following the same 'find object, rearrange murder flashback' path. Even those riddles differing from this pattern all are absolute no-brainers; stuff you would usually expect as a side dish in modern FPS games; so if you come into TVoEC expectig a second Myst, you will be sorely disappointed.  Why buy this game then? Quite frankly: Because the story really is that ♥♥♥♥ing good. Whenever you think you actually got behind what is going on, the game slaps you in the face with another revelation that makes your neat little theory crumble like a card house, or at least causes it to shake violently. Coupled with the amazing atmosphere it provides, this make The Vanishing of Ethan Carter one of the genuinely good 'walking simulators' out there.",

The game doesn't really ever give you an explicit tutorial on anything but keeps things simple enough that you can figure out most everything on your own pretty easily. And it doesn't teach you that you can make as much progress in the game world as you want while missing the story, but it's something you'd pick up on if you kept walking and felt like nothing was happening, because stuff is generally always happening, there is actually not a large amount of transitional time between the main 'scenes' of the game. The game looks and sounds gorgeous of course and even though the path is decisively linear, with a few fake branching paths and a few places off to the side of the main path, it's still enjoyable to explore. And the story is pretty interesting, kind of unsettling but not really 'scary'. The only real flaw in this game is the stupid divergeance into cheap jumpscare territory in one side area, where you're all but guaranteed to get jumped by the miner guy at least once. It's just, completely out of place and running around the bland cave area looking for bodies while trying to avoid this threat is just not what this game is about. I like the murder mysteries throughout the story, even if only the first one poses any real challenge whatsoever. The game is a bit short though, only about 4 hours to complete the first time and I ended up replaying through it quickly on the original version since the redux doesn't have a store page and I wanted to write a review. I wouldn't recommend it for full price, but on sale, certainly worth looking into. So yeah. Enjoyable enough game with a solid plot.

I recommend playing on a high-end graphics card to really see everything at its full potential.

You do all the investigations yourself and put pieces together.

The soundtrack and composition definetly helped with that fact.  Aside from these pro's they don't come without cons. I see a lot of people praising the ever-loving crap out of the graphics, and mind you this has some WICKED SICK visuals like... damn. But the character models? Ugh, I nearly threw up. It SCREAMS Unreal Engine you know? Now I know what they blew the budget on I guess. I guess you could argue the save feature was a bit of a flaw? But I disagree since it's such a SHORT game.

Quick Reference:  THE GOOD • Immersive and interesting story. • Good character development. • Gorgeous world with excelent graphics. • Good and fitting soundtrack. • Nice voice-acting.  THE BAD • Weird auto-save system. • The game does not hold your hand, so it's easy to miss things or to get lost in the world.  SPECIAL (These are topics that are too long to be in a quick reference. If you wanna read about them, go to the end of the review. There will be No Spoilers, I promise.) • The ending • Hours worth of game.   Throught review and commentary:  &gt; IMMERSIVE AND INTERESTING STORY  Immersion is definetely the strongest point of this game. The graphics and the way the story is told and the lack of HUD make the immersion easy and enjoyable. With no HUD, there is nothing or almost nothing to distract you from the experience of playing. It's easy to fell in the shoes of Paul Prospero and the story is pretty good. You feel the need to find out what is happening, why it's happening and how things came to be the way they are. The game is a narrative experience, so this is, as it should be, it's strongest point.  &gt; GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT  There is only a handful of characters in the story and you don't get to see them all that much, but you can clearly distinct each one of them by their personalities. The best of all, though, is not how the characters are, but how they are portrayed in some elements of the game. But I won't spoil it for you. You'll understand when(hopefully) you play the game and think hard enough about it. Have fun!  &gt; GORGEOUS WORLD WITH EXCELLENT GRAPHICS  This is part of what makes the immersion so good. This is one of (if not the) most beautiful games I've ever played. I've found myself stopping to watch some landscapes. This made me thank myself for investing money in a great computer.  &gt; GOOD AND FITTING SOUNDTRACK.  The sounds can really make you feel the game. Also part of the great immersion. THIS IS A GAME TO BE PLAYED ON HEADPHONES(or really loud speakers, if you and the people around you have no problem with it.) The music can make you feel relaxed, anxious, sad... Well, it does it's job well.  &gt; NICE VOICE ACTING  Unique voices and acting won't allow you to mistake a character for another. The actors did a really good job on making each character distinguishable, even when you can only hear and not see them.     X WEIRD AUTO-SAVE SYSTEM  Well, you don't only have to learn the game here, you'll also want to learn how the auto-save system works. You will eventually feel like you can't leave play whenever you want. It is not a big issue, really. But it is something I thought was worth to mention.  X THE GAME DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND  The game itself says: 'This is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand.' This is the first thing you get to read in the whole game, even before the intro. Well, this is an open-world game with mysteries scaterred around. It is very easy to completely miss something. I got stuck two or three times. Well, it can happen. It is not an easy game.   &gt;&gt; CONCLUSION &lt;&lt;  One of the best experiences I've ever had with a game in my life. No wonder I came here to write such a detailed review. This is a very well-crafted game that is all about the experience of playing it. If I were to give you a piece of advice: Play this game in a moment people do not need you, or won't call you. As I said, this game is all about the immersion, and being interrupted breaks it, so try not to let yourself be interrupted.  That said, I believe this game is worth it's full price. And I do recomend you to buy it and hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Cheers!    ** THE ENDING  When you clear the game you will remember what I'm saying here: THERE IS MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE.  It is very easy to see what the ending looks like judge on the spot. People seem to do this frequently when there is SO MUCH MORE to it. When you clear this game, give the ending, and the whole story, a second thought, or research about it. You won't regret it. I promise.  ** HOURS WORTH OF GAME  This is not a long game on it's own. And replaying The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is just like re-reading a book. You will go through the same scenes again. Well, you might pick some pieces of the story you didn't get right the first time, but there is nothing completely new. Looking at it that way it seems like a short lived game. But again: There is more than meets the eye. Try to give things a second thought, rethink the game and you might find many hours of fun without being actually playing.",

Also some missleading and inconsistent leaders. For instance, when you first start out, there are some fairly obvious indications towards clues which lead you to suppose this is a common precident, and yet later in the game with some of the more important clues, they are not evident at all so you could easy miss them. Beware also of back tracking to look for possible missing clues, as picking up objects at previous save points seems to erase your progress. The developers state that it is an 'experience, in non-linear fashion' and for the most part this is true, but you will encounter the invisible wall syndrome quite frequently. Jumping off bridges or swimming in the lake is definately a no-no, no matter how hard you try.  A labour of love without doubt, and worthy of praise, but if you lack patience, stamina and a considerable attention span, you could find yourself developing a thousand yard stare.",

That is the long and short of how I felt about this game; not to say that it didn't have problems, but I'll get into that.   You play as a paranormal detective investigating 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter'; hence the title. You find clues about him through solving the murder mysteries of his relatives. As a paranormal detective, you have a special skill of seeing exactly how they died, and where Ethan went, by solving each killing. As you progress through the game you find out more about the family members, and Ethan himself through papers you get from solving each mystery. Think of a Myst-lite crossed with murder investigatons... and that is more or less this game honestly, it isn't much broader than than that.   Speaking of Myst, this game is very heavy on exploration and immersion. However, the puzzle aspect of Myst is slightly lacking in here for this to be a perfect comparison to Myst. Not to say this doesn't have puzzles, there are quite a few in here, but they aren't as difficult or... as usually obscure, as they are in Myst. Which to be honest, i'm pretty happy about since I was able to get through the game without a guide. (I did use a guide for one of the achievements though).    This game is very short and sweet, and I was able to complete it in an afternoon. However, its length felt appropriate, not bloated or too short, I'd compare it to a nice desert and wine that follows a main course meal. That being said I have some 'minor' complains about it.   My main complaints about this game are are:  1. There are multiple parts where you have to ride an elevator up and down SlOWLY, ride some sort of locomotive SLOWLY, or just having to go through really slow areas. Not only multiple parts, which I can be fine with, but you potentially have to go through them multiple times. Not only that also, but elevators stay on the floor that you left them on, and then you have to wait while they SLOWLY come back up, and then having to wait while they take their time on going down. I HATE that we still have these parts in games, we have maps now for games with fast points. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO FIX THIS. Which brings me to point-   2. There is no map in this game. Now I can hear people saying that having a map would break the experience of being fully immersed in this world. Those people might be right, but me breaking my keyboard in frustration brings me out of games faster than having a map would. That is all.  3. I experienced a couple hiccups in the framerate, my computer could be at fault, but I saw where other people were complaining about this also.  Other than that, this was overall a very good game. I'd recomend it to people who enjoy love, happiness, and puppies.",

The game doesn't do anything revolutionary, nor does it require complex problem solving, but it doesn't constrain you from experiencing the story in your own way, at your own pace.  The beautiful vistas of Red Creek Valley - as can be seen from the myriad screenshots in the game's Community Hub, each of which could pass as a desktop wallpaper - are just one aspect where the immense amount of polish put into the game can be seen. This attention to detail extends into the way puzzles and clues are presented to you as well as how tidbits of information suddenly become relevant and enrich the story. Almost every spoken line or scrap of paper carries some significance that might not dawn on the player until the very end (or a second playthrough).  By far the most impressive thing in the game for me, however, was the interplay of natural and supernatural elements and the way these are tied into the narrative. The story can seem cliché and simple at first glance, but once you revisit earlier events and reconsider their significance or the way the protagonist and the other characters react to them, multiple interpretations of Ethan Carter's story suddenly open up. What's in the past and what's in the present, whether what you see is fantasy or reality is up to the observer to decide, and based on the number of contrasting opinions in the game forums, most people have their own version of how the story supposedly goes.  Some locations in the game can evoke a sense of dread, but those annoyed by scripted jump scares can rest easy: if you're attentive, your nerves won't be unfairly tested.  The experience is a short but sweet one and the game resonated with me enough to warrant subsequent visits to the valley. I would have liked the puzzles to be more demanding and the locations to contain more objects providing further backgrund information on the characters, but even so, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter shows that interactive storytelling doesn't have to guide you down a straight path to be memorable and thought-provoking.",

The games lack of hand holding makes you explore every inch of the area just in case you miss something but many of the areas are simply completely empty and only serve as scenery to the next area.

In fact I've played many first person shooters hoping to satiate this need for exploration but have always been left with the empty realization that the only reason the FPS I'm playing was created is to shoot everything that moves. The tragedy is that the FPS genre is defined by the fact that 'S' stands for shooter.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter chucks that 'S' out the window and pulls you into a gorgeous first person perspective world meant to be savored. And damn is it gorgeous. Its also creepy as hell, and those 2 things blend together perfectly. The breathtaking vistas compel you to explore the other side of every hill and bend in the road, but the haunting soundtrack suggests that you just might not like what you find.

The user tags define this game as 'detective', 'psychological horror', and 'puzzle.' I would say that it's more of a first-person atmospheric walking narrative with some mystery elements. A few pointers if you decide to give it a go:   1) Do not use online walkthroughs until you are ready to move on to a new 'zone' (usually designated by new scenery, a new cutscene, or a change in music). While you're in a zone, explore every nook and cranny. It's a beautiful game, so explore it.  2) I only figured out around the 3-4 hr mark that I could run ('shift' key). Made my life a whole lot easier getting from point A to B.  3) Don't let the strange 'fantasy-like' cutscenes throw you off... they will all make sense in the end. 4) Play the game through in its entirety. It took me ~6 hrs from start to finish (including a quick run-through to find some achievements that I missed in the first playthrough).

Eventually though I after spending well over an hour wandering around I began to get frustrated.   And that's the biggest problem with the game. Actually knowing that there was a puzzle in front of you.   Generally they weren't that taxing to solve once you came to that realisation. It took me playing for 2-3 hours and the use of a guide to work out that I actually hadn't completed several sections of the game - but I had no way of knowing that. In hindsight, I realise now that the very first encounters do allude to methods that need to be used further on. It was just too subtle to pick up on.  Visually the game is stunning. I found myself stopping regularly just to take in the surrounding scenery. It actually looks and feels like a living breathing world.   The music is mostly understated but suits the unfolding story perfectly.  The game isn't long. I played through the entire thing in around 5 hours but my playtime was definitely reduced by the use of a guide at certain spots. Normally I try to avoid external help as it detracts from the experience but in this case the lack of guidance within the game warranted it.  So if you're looking for something short and challenging with an interesting story to discover then I'd recommend giving this a look.",

Gameplay: The gameplay is quite small. You walk, look and sometime press your left mousebutton to read something. That's it. The riddles woven into the game are not too hard, but might cause some headaches.  Story: The story is a bit weird and you will just understand it just in the end.  Short form: a boy is lost. You gotta search him. To go on you have to solve cases of murders. The end left me deeply disturbed and sad. Those who already played this game will understand.  Conclusion: An amazing game, which is sadly too short. And that is my only critic. I've beat the game in 5-6 hours. And I took some time just to stand around and look at the landscape. I strongly recommend you this game.  I wish 'The Astronauts' financial success, so they can make more amazing games. Good work guys.",

I admit, I had to resort to online playthroughs in a couple of spots -- I had no idea what the game wanted me to do. But I soon got used to the rhythm of it and finished without further hints.  I'm not sure the story was quite as spectacular as the reviews indicated, but I walked away from the game still thinking through the plot. Well above average for a storytelling game.",

It gives you little to no advice on what to do, leaving the new player to wander aimlessly in an open world. So take your time to explore. This game doesn’t play around when it tells you it won’t be holding your hand.  This game combines the ‘walking simulator’ experience with engaging and challenging gameplay. It also combines different types of challenges, surprising the player. though I must say the difficulty seemed to decrease nearing its climax, allowing more of a ‘flow’ in the storyline but at times it was simply a bit too easy compared to the rest of the game. It definitely focuses more on the story than gameplay.   The music in this game is absolutely stunning and a huge contribution to the atmosphere. It’s a present element but not overpowering, inviting the player to enjoy the equally enchanting scenery.   The redux version saves more frequently and eliminates a few aspectes of the game that were considered ‘immersion breaking’ (trying to be spoiler free).

            "review_text": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautiful looking game that tells the story of Ethan Carter and the relationship with his family in a very interesting and engaging way. It's important to realise that is more an interactive visual novel than a straightforward adventure game. It has more in common with games like Dear Esther and Gone Home than Gabriel Knight and the Black Mirror series. But the inclusion of the puzzles and the way the story is told, sets it apart from these games. Compared to traditional adventure games, the game is fairly short. It should take you about six hours on a first playthrough and less than half that on a second playthrough. The replay value lies in the story and the way it's told. Once you've reached the end you'll see everything you've experienced in a new light. On a second playthrough you'll have a much better understanding of the 'real' story and pick up on dozens of subtle clues that you probably missed the first time around. Once you've finished the game it's worth to scour the forum for more information about the story of the game. There are a lot of interesting theories (some confirmed by the creators) and links to in depth interviews with the creators. These forum posts are full of spoilers so don't bother with them until you've finished the game. I'm serious, don't, you'll spoil the surprise. Besides the engrossing story I also really liked the psychic detective puzzles, seen in one of the videos above. They're unique to this game and I wish there would've been more of them.  I recognized a lot of my younger self in Ethan (though my family was much nicer and didn't get killed) and that really helped to draw me into his world and his story. So if you're also a little like Ethan Carter, and you were reading horror, detective, science fiction and fantasy books at a young age and loved to write stories yourself, you should really play this game.",

The game is beautiful in terms of aesthetics and its story. Personally, I was initially on the fence as to what should be expected from this title as it is not my usual genre (usually having a preference for platformers and shooters) and some negative feedback with regards to the game ending and 'game save' issues had me worried. With regards to the 'save point' issues I read about, I EXPERIENCED NONE. As for the story, if you choose to take the story events at surface value you may have a negative experience, but I implore you to search the story for the deepest implications it could have and hopefully this work will leave you content at the very least.   Pros: + Amazing Graphical Style + Beautiful Soundtrack + In-depth Story + Decent/Good Voice-acting + Intuitive Game Mechanics + Puzzle Quality; Hard enough usually to make you think for a second but generally not hard enough to cause frustration + Environmental Exploration Opportunities  Cons: - Skipping over puzzle locations can lead to the need for back-tracking, which some may find frustrating - Dialogue sometimes cuts short if you leave from a 'scene' area too quickly (rare occurrence) - Environmental Audio Transitions; on occassion environmental sound transitions are too abrupt (an example, would be standing in a doorway and hearing no sound from a nearby waterfall and then hearing it roar the moment you exit the doorway) - Lack of combat for those that appeals to - Somewhat short with around 5 hours of playtime  ***PURCHASING/AVOIDING POINTS***  ***ABSOLUTE must-buy if looking for a quality game with a reasonable price-tag*** ***AVOID if walking through the environment to find areas of interest bores you as you will have to do this some***  I absolutely recommend this game and to those who play it, enjoy the ride.",

The videogames takes place in a huge map the player can roam freely. In this map there are several points of interest that clue the player in a murder that was committed on the location: your objective each time is to examine the surrounding area for clue and put all the pieces together or simply explore the place, solve a puzzle of some sort and uncover a tale left by Ethan behind.

It almost felt like a teaser if you are expecting closer to the story length of most games these days.  I bought this game on a sale for less than $7.

The game doesn't really ever give you an explicit tutorial on anything but keeps things simple enough that you can figure out most everything on your own pretty easily. And it doesn't teach you that you can make as much progress in the game world as you want while missing the story, but it's something you'd pick up on if you kept walking and felt like nothing was happening, because stuff is generally always happening, there is actually not a large amount of transitional time between the main 'scenes' of the game. The game looks and sounds gorgeous of course and even though the path is decisively linear, with a few fake branching paths and a few places off to the side of the main path, it's still enjoyable to explore. And the story is pretty interesting, kind of unsettling but not really 'scary'. The only real flaw in this game is the stupid divergeance into cheap jumpscare territory in one side area, where you're all but guaranteed to get jumped by the miner guy at least once. It's just, completely out of place and running around the bland cave area looking for bodies while trying to avoid this threat is just not what this game is about. I like the murder mysteries throughout the story, even if only the first one poses any real challenge whatsoever. The game is a bit short though, only about 4 hours to complete the first time and I ended up replaying through it quickly on the original version since the redux doesn't have a store page and I wanted to write a review. I wouldn't recommend it for full price, but on sale, certainly worth looking into. So yeah. Enjoyable enough game with a solid plot.

Reasons why I changed my mind:  - I've since played others of this genre and realized that this is actually one of the best of it's kind.  - It goes on sale all the time and if you buy it at a discount it is absolutely worth it. The only reason I'd say it's not at full price is because of it's length.  ORIGINAL:  TL;DR: An enjoyable game, but is neither worth $20 or the praise that it receives.   Pros: The visuals and the audio are beautiful and convey a haunting and immersive experience, very atmospheric.   It is a good story and it is easy to care for the characters.   Cons: The game is very short, the world is very small. If you can get it on sale go for it, but it does not measure up to other other games of the genre and price on Steam.  The puzzles are very simple and not all that interesting, which does not help the game last any longer.  The save problem is not as bad as other reviews make it seem.

Recommended as 'art', but it's an interactive story, not a game  I've got to admire the makers for giving us a distinct and beautiful open world game with a melancholic and eerie atmosphere throughout. It's like wandering around a weird abandoned wilderness that lies somewhere between a Stephen King novel and Myst. The graphics and music can't be faulted.  However, as much as it has shown great potential in the likes of Flower and Shadow of Colossus, this to me is a sign that this indie trend of 'games = art' is getting a little tired, at the expense of producing a game that actually has gameplay. So you get a fanbase easy to please by a world with a nice setting atmosphere and graphics regardless of what the story and gameplay are like.  I had my eyes on this since it was released, and really wanted to like it, as I heard 'Lovecraftian point and click adventure' and thought 'well there still aren't enough of those'. saw the trailer and screenshots and was convinced.  Unfortunately though this barely functions as a point and click game. Sure the reviews clearly say already this is 'short and sweet', some estimating the game length at 4 or 5 hours. Mine has been logged at around 6 I think, but I spent so much time backtracking I could have done it in half the time. More on this issue I had later. Reviews online have also referred to its 'restrained story'. No kidding, there barely is one, and I found the ending disappointingly anticlimactic in terms of gameplay and cryptic and somewhat cliched in terms of the story resolution, also the 'Lovecraftian' setting was hugely overstated. It works more as a Stephen King psychological horror than anything else. .  Regarding the point and click functions, I found every puzzle laughably easy once you work out the logic behind the game, which takes a while, because perhaps not unusual for a point and click, it does basically throw you into an open-world wilderness at the start and leave you to figure out how the basics of the game work as you go along. So as stated I spent half the game backtracking and doing bits and bobs of puzzles in a weird order until I figured out how the process of puzzle solving works in this game. Once you do get it it's exactly the same thing every time, doesn't get any harder, if anything with the last few it gets easier. A learning curve doesn't exist in this game.  This game is a pleasant experience and journey, and the basic story surrounding the family is rather moving, but don't expect much of a game or a challenge out of it, and I frankly wouldn't bother unless it's knocked down to under £10 in a steam sale. The whole atmospheric Lovecraftian point and click has been done far better before in my opinion in the Darkness Within games, which had more puzzles, more gameplay and a darker atmosphere to them, despite presumably having a considerably smaller budget and less slick graphics.  P.S. As stated by reviews online and on steam, the autosave system does indeed leave a lot to be desired",

It looks beautiful, it sounds perfect and your goals and how to find them become clear soon enough.  But then the flaws begin to trickle through. Red Creek Valley is big. Too big. All too soon you find yourself searching for a needle in a haystack. Oh, did you miss that? Well, better go back or you won't be able to finish the game!  To me, that's not the game's disclaimer 'not holding your hand', that's developers being to lazy to create something that makes sense as a whole. It's like a world with very few random interactive spots thrown around, to not distract you too much from their beautiful graphics simulator.  And when you finally find something to keep you from falling asleep during those long hikes, it's equally boring and unintuitive. Puzzles, if you can call them that, are way to easy and are a mere distraction. And when you are backtracking a story you find yourself running around looking for items like a fool, in places these items would never be. Tedious.  As far as the story itself, there are parts that are very creative, and made me regain my interests, and then there are parts that made me go: 'Oh dear.' Especially the ending, which, to be honest, turned an OK story into a pretty silly one.  All in all, I would only recommend this game if you could get it in a sale, and want to run around in beautiful Red Creek Valley. Don't bother about the story, though, you'll just get annoyed.",

Your job is to reconstruct who killed who, and this is how it goes:  You run around and come across typical adventure items (a lamp, an axe, a dead body, etc.), but you cannot interact or do anything with them. All you have to do is  find  all items in a certain area, which automatically prompts a flashback scene with 5 story elements and you have to guess the sequence of events, like this: (1) he picked up the axe, (2) he talked to his brother, (3) he went over to the chapel, (4) he killed his uncle, (5) he talked to his mother. That's it. Then you head to the next area, find all its items, flashback pops up..... You do this guess-the-sequence thing for the fate of each family member. That's all there is, basically.

Beautiful environments that seem close to photo realistic. Truly remarkable. HOWEVER this seems to be a pretty poorly optimized game. I run the game at a constant 60 FPS however I get an almost unbearable 'micro-stutter'. I have went through hours of forums and tried several different methods; editing the ini, turning on / off smoothing etc. Nothing seems to help. Sadly I feel like this is unacceptable. When you buy a game you shouldn't have to spend hours editing .ini files trying to make it work.  Sound: Wonderful melodic soundtrack is married with well done (if a little underutilized) voice work. Can't complain on this end at all! Well done.  Story: I haven't beaten the game yet (mostly because I have spent so much time trying to make it work); however the story is very intriguing and reminiscent of a Lovecraftian tale! Certainly keeps the momentum going. Can't wait to continue.  Overall thoughts: I'm currently giving this game a thumbs down. Not because I don't think this game isn't great; it certainly is; potentially could go down as one of my favorites. However the amount issues are insane! Launcher didn't work, controller didn't work, constant stutter and audio locked a low volume. All of these issues are fixable (except for stutter as far as I'm concerned) however you have to waste WAY to much time making this work. It's a bummer these issues bring down such a remarkable game.

Your character has very limited abilities in the 'movie' - you can walk/run, view things, interact with things, and crouch. Everything is in first-person view. There is no real 'action' - you won't be shooting at things, or ducking, or anything like that. You will be moving from puzzle to puzzle in order to advance the plot.  Graphics are very pretty (Unreal engine), and when everything is turned up to max it can cause even a beefy system to jitter every now and then.

I don't have much experience with playable movies, although the PlayStation Drake's series feel that way. This game just hasn't drawn me in.   One annoying feature of the game is savegames. The game only does saves at certain checkpoints, and those checkpoints, from what I can tell, are at the beginning of each puzzle. Some puzzles take a while to complete, so if you do 80% and then need to close the game, when you load the game up you lose all your progress. I really hate that.

If that and rare bits of story popping in on occasion are enough to make you love a game, then this might be for you. However, if you want anything other than visuals, sounds, and some story, this game may very well leave you terribly unfulfilled, and/or bored. I had to push myself to play as long as I did. I needed something to interest me, and I could not find it, even when something the game presented as exciting occurred. In fact, I got bored with the 'exciting' thing and looked away in the game to check something else out and missed a little bit of the scripted event as a result. If the stuff this game presents as exciting can't even keep me interested, its primary gameplay (wandering around and looking at stuff) which takes up the majority of the gameplay time, has no hope of entertaining me.  One might say I hate 'walking simulators,' but I liked SOMA, and it's almost a walking simulator, but it unfortunately features horror elements. Stuff trying to kill you in that game was my least favorite part of it, and I would have found the game to be better if none of that was in the game, with just the walking around, the dialog, and maybe a handful of puzzles at most. The philosophical aspects and world in that game were cool, and it's incredibly memorable. However, the parts that were unlike a walking simulator were the least enjoyable parts, and I would prefer the game without them, even if that meant no puzzles and a little more dialog, etc.",

This quite quickly gave me a headache but fortunately you can turn off motion blur and then you can actually enjoy the gorgeous scenery.  Now getting to the actual game, it is like someone played Dear Ester and thought we should make a game like that but add some more user interaction like some puzzles or something. This in itself is an excellent idea and could have resulted in a great game but this is not it. Where Dear Ester subtly guides you along a fairly linear path and advances the story, this game just give you an expansive environment and makes you go and find tiny objects hidden about the place. You spend ages scouring the forest getting more frustrated, that is if you don't miss the puzzle entirely. This scenario needs a team of scene of crime officers to systematically search the area not a nut job paranormal investigator erratically running about the forest tampering with crime scenes. As you do manage to complete the puzzles it progresses the uninspiring story. Then just when I lost all interest in the story it surprisingly managed to culminate with a nice conclusion.

            "review_text": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is visually beautiful.  The story is well done, but surprisingly short. Most of the time played was spent running around looking for text I could interact with, which is sparse. The player cannot interact with the world in any way save for in very specific locations in a very large area. Want to look at that book? Nope. Open that  door? Nope. There is a reason for this, but it detracts from the game play. There wasn't enough meat in the story, for me, to support the end and the brevity of the story. Nor was there enough character connection for me to care very much about the characters. The end I got was interesting, but it could have been so much more. And for 20 buckaroos, it should have been.  I recommend this game for its visual beauty and sound. Good for a sale. Otherwise, no. ",

            "review_text": "Went into this knowing absolutely nothing about it, just taking a risk and playing on a whim.  To be honest. I wouldn't recommend this as a 'game' as such but it does a great job as a 'tech demo' or promo reel for the art department. Undeniably impressive to look at it's like walking through digitized picture postcards.  I'm a little less enthused by the story, plot, atmosphere and immersion overall though. It's like starting a Steven King novel two chapters from the end. You know, when they go all paranormal and the suspense, buildup and interest gets dumped out in favour of his tradmark unreal guff towards the end. Unfortunately we start the story of Ethan Carter about there. The cliches run through the brief experience like the river that runs through the settlement you find yourself in. The area of exploration is relatively small which actually turns out to be a blessing in disguise.   Without any real explanation as to how the mechanics work as it's a 'narrative experience that doesn't hold your hand' (or, 'we're pretentious and if you don't get how this works first time you're an idiot'), you're left to figure things out for yourself. This would be fine in itself if the 'game' didn't then penalise you with drudgery in the form of hiking back through the same scenes for missing things you weren't aware you were looking for in the first place (this is sprung on you very close to the end). Once you realise these picture postcards you're walking through are essentially sterile and somewhat stuck in time, backtracking becomes less than appealing.  It's a product that thinks it is a lot cleverer than it actually is. Stripped of the oh-so pretty scenery and some nice musical cues it would be a bargain bin knockoff supernatural paperback.  A lot of work has definitely gone into this and it shows, but unfortunately it relies on its looks a little too heavily and once you scratch that expertly rendered artistic veneer, there's little of substance beneath.   Can't really recommend it which is a shame as it's certainly worth a look, but really only a 'look' - maybe watch it over someones shoulder instead, or read a Steven King novel whilst using a postcard of New England as a bookmark.

            "review_text": "So it's sad but the main reason I bought this game is because it was pretty. And the scenery is really nice to look at... I had to turn off the motion blur but with everything else on high it just looks so vivid and alive. But unfortunately graphics aren't the only thing you need in a game, and the gameplay in this is rather weak. It basically boils down to a handful of puzzles to solve, none of which are that difficult. And after you solve all the puzzles and beat the game there's really no replay value unless you want to take nice, quiet walks in the woods. So I just stumbled through the game in a little over 4 hours, got all the 'side stories' and even though I had fun I really can't recommend the game at the current price tag of $19.99. So... hold off on this game until it's at least 50% off or more. It's fun, and it's pretty, but it's just way too short for the price.",
