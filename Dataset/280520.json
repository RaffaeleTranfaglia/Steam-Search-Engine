            "review_text": "Don't get me wrong the game is great. But...  - It's a poor Terraria clone: less content, less items, less enemies, less bosses, less crafting; - There are skills, but... too few skills, some are totally useless; - Craft here is based on recipes and they don't drop, this lead to allmighty 50 lvl character with everything maxed in 32 lvl gear... sigh... - No need to build anything, same sickness as in Starbound, all you need is few craft stations and a lot of chests; - Tedious inventory management, there are so many reagents (multiplied by 4 tiers) stacking those in chests manually is really annoying. - Crafting is progressive (low level item is upgraded), but craft UI is terrible, it's constant scrolling up-down to find manually which item you have to craft first, which second, etc..  End-game is basically running dungeons with 65-lvl mobs (you are lvl 50). It's very quickly become boring. When skills are maxed there is no progression anymore.. apart from trying to find recipes. Clearing 50 horde realms to find 1 (!) recipe is pretty much tells about RNG in this game. I wanted to do all achievements in this game, but after seeing this I just gave up.  It has 0 replayability. Random world? Well, the smallest word will hold all content replicated several times. Another character? There will be no difference, because stats do too little and gear is again all the same.  This game need another year of development to become something what Terraria already is.",

            "review_text": "  Crea is a cute sandbox RPG with procedurally generated worlds that is heavily inspired by Terarria; therefore, if you enjoyed playing Terarria, you'll probably have a lot of fun with this one too. Even more so, since Crea extends what Terarria offers with a few new features that are very entertaining and nice.  One of the most important features is the leveling system: everything you do in Crea gives you experience points, categorized by what you do to gain them. The XP are not added only to your character level, but they're also split according to the action you perform: exploring will give you XP in the Exploration category, mining or cutting wood will give you XP in the Gathering area etc. In addition to that, there's a talent system - according to the level you have in an area, you can unlock passive or active abilities that make your character stronger or increases your gathering or crafting skills.  The two main aspects of these kind of games are split in two separate interfaces - there is a setup for survival mode (combat) and another setup for the gathering mode (building); each of these setups comes with two separate toolbars that you can customize according to your needs. Switching between the setups or the toolbars is very easy (one key press). However, having this kind of design makes it a bit difficult during early levels to perform both combat and gathering during the night, since switching to combat mode makes you lose the only source of light you have, leaving you in complete darkness to fight with your enemies, unless you put down a torch every few steps. This problem falls away at later levels by the time you acquire luminescent weapons or a spell that conjures a light orb that follows you.  The enemies are of various types and come with different fight mechanics: some of them should be meleed from behind, others can be killed easier using ranged weapons. This makes good use of the double toolbar setup for the combat mode, since you'll need to have both a melee set of weapons and a ranged one. I found the difficulty of the enemies at lower levels a bit too high, even on easy mode - they do a lot of damage; you need to parry or dodge a lot since the majority of them can kill you in 2 hits.  Crea has Dungeons, how cool is that!!! Independent areas on the map, that despawn after completion, dungeons provide a lot of fun and... very cool loot(since you can snatch all the goodies and fill your house with shinies) :)  The crafting aspect of the game is extensive; you can craft the plain old way, by one-clicking (oh and by the way, crafting with this method is instant, there's no progress bar or waiting time until you get your desired item). As an alternative to that, the game features Chaos-mode, which is a mini game that makes use of crafting talents gained through leveling in order to produce better or more items. The crafting recipes are discovered by researching but you are only able to research recipes you have mats for. On one hand, this limits your crafting possibilities to items that you have mats for. On the other hand, you can't see a full list of everything that can be researched; if you want to craft a fancy item, you won't know in advance what you need to gather in order to research it, unless of course you spoil it for yourself by consulting the Wiki.  The clean interface features moveable windows, which is very useful while crafting, either for organizing your inventory and the needed mats or for comparing the stats between the crafted gear and the equipped one. However, even with these moveable windows, I found it quite annoying that I don't have any indication when a mob attacks me while having my screen full of these windows. I believe that a blinking screen or a red border would be very useful in this case.  The basics of the game are summarized into a short and concise tutorial; the information that it provides is in my opinion enough not only to get you started, but also to make you understand the mechanics of the game; the rest is left to the player's own exploration.  Apart from some small bugs that didn't disturb my gameplay enjoyment too much, I had only one problem with the game: it consumes quite a lot of PC resources despite the fact that it shouldn't; the lighting or having multiple things happening in the background is very CPU hungry, often causing spikes; after 3-4h in game my PC already starts to struggle with the high CPU usage and tabbing out doesn't help it at all. Since the developer is quite active in the forums, I have faith that this optimization issue will soon be addressed and fixed.  I had a lot of fun playing Crea so far. I feel that it's a wonderful and well designed game that is worth the asking price. For the nice graphics, hours of entertainment, Steam integration with achievements and workshop, I highly recommend this game.   Note: A key has been provided by the developer with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received. My personal opinions about this game are not influenced by this.",

I see this game having potential to compete but as of writing this review I dont feel it's close yet. I've had teleport bugs where it wont let me move. I've had loot issues that dissapear for no reason. The game also feels limited in variety for building things. I do like the game, but can't see myself playing until another big content update.

            "review_text": "  Disclaimer: i recieved this copy for free to write a review about the game. However this will not influece my review. Source of consideration: Siege Games  Crea is a sandbox rpg game with a lot of farming, digging, gathering and exploring. The graphic is simple 2D graphic, however its not bad.  Heard from friends, that Crea is a Terraria 2.0 game. I do own Terraria, but my library pretty huge so not had time to play that game yet, i cant confirm that information.  Crea allows you to level your character in many different ways. Your gathering, crafting, arms skills, spell skills and alone your hero get different experience and all these have different leveling system. Reaching next level on those experience trees unlock purchaseable abilites/boosts for your character. So you can see, character development is pretty deep in Crea.  You cant craft any item you want right away. you need collect materials/ingerdients and then you need study those items, research them and then develop what could you craft from those. Sounds painful? its not, its fun, even if the research process destroys the item. New armors, weapons, building materials will be available as you progress through the game and as you research how to create those items, Crea offers a long and enjoyable gameplay while you build up your character, its house and clear hostile fauna.  Sadly i not had much time to play Crea yet because of Euro 2016 and Copa America, but i allready love it and would recommend to anyone, its a pretty decent game for its genre, developer definetly spent a lot of time on it and one of the few games on steam what actually left early access and now officially released! Additionally, Crea has an affordable price which not much compared to the playtime this game offers.  Pros: +deep character development +deep item research system +multiplayer available but you can enjoy single player just as much as multiplayer if you prefer that +the random generated worlds are huge, you have a lot to explore, monsters grant you hard, challenging figths +some might dislike this, but map shows suggested levels for areas so you can avoid areas where you would encounter much stronger enemies   Cons: -i have some issues with combat. magic casting too slow, melee much faster and stronger, it might change later as character evolves, ill keep an eye on this and will update review. -i need to further investigate the reason but sometimes i have lags and performance issues what i shouldnt have as my rig much-much better than requirements.  Overall rating: 8/10 for the genre however i not seen any better game for this genre yet.",

            "review_text": "I bought the game before it was even taken out of early access, and even at that time I would have still recommended it.   But now being over 60 hours into the game I can safely say it is currently my favorite game, and I play it several hours a day.  Originally the game was really buggy, it still is. BUT, the dev Jasson, is attempting to fix the bugs, every single day he works on this game. He goes into the discussions, and he streams the development on Twitch, where if you have a pressing bug, he will help you right there. Anything you have problems with he tries to resolve all of them. So even if the game is buggy, at least this dev takes his time to address them.  He also plans to take suggestions for the game once the major bugs have been sorted out.  So don't take it being buggy as something bad, because in time it'll be less and less. Also, sometimes the bugs make for hilarious screenshots(take a look at mine).  I bought the game because some friends and I were getting bored of Terraria. This game looked cool, and so we took the chance. We are now all 40+ hours into the game and try to compete with each other to get maxed out. It is an incredibly fun game, with literally so much to do and to learn. It is fun alone, but even better with a few buds.  The game is by far, worth it's pricetag. Spend the money, even now with what issues it has. It is worth every cent. Don't be a fool and waste any time not delving into this wonderful game!   *Especially if you plan on seeing if it'll be in the Steam Summer Sale (2016), the dev already stated it won't be on sale until the Winter Sale.*",

Having platinumed the PS Vita version of Terraria, and having tried virtually all of the other sandbox experiences out there (many of them merely watered down derivatives of the genre-leaders) I can't say I was massively enamoured with the thought of sinking more time into another. I was a little jaded, tbh.   However, I'm glad I did. Because Crea has certainly been worth my time so far. The graphics are simple but functional, the music isn't to my taste but I can turn it off without having to mute it in the volume mixer, and the game runs stable even if it could do with better optimisation.   If you, like me, you have run the gamut of sandboxes, then you'll basically know what you'll be getting into, with the pleasant exception that the devs have clearly put some thought (and work) into Crea. The lore, the levelling, the intuitive controls (using a Xbox 360 controller at least), the crafting and the overall experience.   And an actual working (and coherent) tutorial - hallelujah!  The combat is fast-paced and frantic.   The crafting is logical and varied.   The levelling is Skyrim-esque.   Would I recommend it?   Definitely, the game as it is is worthy of your time and money, and the post-release roadmap, if it can be realised, looks particularly intriguing.  Rating  7/10 (for now) Pros:  Fun sandbox gameplay with an actual twist, RPG flavoured.  Mod support.  Controller support / Configurable controls Frequent updates / bug-fixes.  Ongoing support / updates.  Cons:  Graphics are little more than functional. Not a fan of the music.  Could benefit from greater optimisation (though dev has indicated that this will be forthcoming).  Time-sink (con for a new dad!).  Loading times.

            "review_text": "    Please, keep in mind that this is only an opinion of mine and each of us has their own, unique, thoughts. The review describes my expression of the game and nothing more than that. Moreover, this particularly review holds more formal nature and form. The review might be updated later to follow game's playing style and nature.  April 4th, year 2016. The copy was obtained from Siege Games.    What will you think being at Crea's storepage for the first time? 'Oh, once again a sandboxy Terraria clone.' But be sure that won't be precisely right. Of course, we can't deny there are similarities in both games as well as in the genre in general. That's why being a fan of lookalike titles you are always looking for something new and innovative to be in the forthcoming product. And truly, Crea possess some interesting elements and features which make it distinctive compared to its predecessors.  Without further go, I really enjoyed Crea. It might look similar for the newcomers at the beginning as you are thrown into the world, given some instructions and set to go. However, the further you progress the deeper game immersion becomes. As usual, you gather materials, kill monsters, craft gear and build a home for yourself. Then you dive deeper or travel farther to explore new horizons repeating all that on a greater scale. Sounds familiar, indeed, but there is more to it than what is seen plainly on surface.   The most developed and well designed part of game is crafting system. It's interesting, it's catchy and what's even more important it's complex. You can't just 'I got the deer muscus now I can make an *Uber 2156 Annihilator Optimus  Prime '. Here you have to actually research each material figuring its specifications and how and where it can be used - and you will need to do that several times learning more and more of a particular item as your researching (crafting) level increases and so do your skills. Therefore great or just regular items can be created when you collect enough materials to both analyze and use them in the crafting process. Though sometimes you can find prepared recipes as well. There are only few stations each usable for certain categories of items. You can 'improve' them by finding (mostly in random chests) different techpieces. What's absolutely worth mentioning is 'Chaos system' which allows you to craft better items giving them additional stats or special characteristics depending on how well you manage to keep the 'Chaos' from ruining your work using different features and talents to do so (that's sort of hard to explain in the review but I hope main point is still comprehensible).   Next, there is also an extended talents 'tree' with different branches. You gain points by running around, killing monsters, shooting  hadoukens  fireballs, breaking blocks and crafting and then allocate them to affiliated sections thus learning new fighting techniques and new spells as well as improving yourself and your more pacific skills generally. There are quite enough of such abilities so you won't be bored and can always try playing a new style, like battlemage or rogue-archer.   Finally, lets talk about the world you are in and its content. As usual, you can create several sizes where each will have ground, sky and underground levels with different biomes. You can travel only by foot or by crystal waypoints, unfortunately, but who knows if wings or transport will be added in the future updates - that would surely be nice. Monster are unique and each has its own style and combat pattern so as abilities while some may be challenging to face in the early stage. There aren't many monsters though, to be honest. Bosses prove to be even more tough and provide a necessary degree of 'buttpain' if you don't master evasion or figure what is the right way to fight them. Exploration aspect is solid enough with many caves and hidden goodies underground like chests or rooms with pages about the preset or world's past.   Rather doable element is fighting/gathering: you have to switch between 2 modes which also have two tabs each which might be confusing a bit to those who were previously playing games like Terraria, for instance. You will constantly need to switch to fighting if you are mining underground, but It's still somewhat versatile system in the end. In-game animations are well done and lovely (except for the jumping). Graphics is pretty common to the genre but still has some charm to it mostly due to beautiful and full-blooded arts, though backgrounds are rather simple. Effects are stylish and there is physics in place - shooting ball of earth may destroy a block or drop icicles from the ceiling which will damage enemies when fall, for example. Main game menu is simple too but that's not to be concerned of. Interface is fine but small improvements could still be added (for example, bigger fonts). Soundtrack is nice and plausible to hear.  Technically, there is nothing to be concerned of. Game is out of Early Access and was granted almost bugless state. The only issues I had so far are two crashes which appeared during boss fights when game was acting a big laggish and light sphere (the one serving as light source) dissapearing after you travel via crystal or die and a couple of sound effects missing (harvesting plants and logs underground, for instance), but that's not critical mostly. Performance &amp; optimization is great overally and game runs smoothly on both powerful, mid-end and 'cozy' specs like Mac Air (well, nothing surprising as it's not really resourceful).

Add in true stats, leveling, and a recipe system that you actually have to work to learn and you have countless hours of progression. Not to mention the tons of skills weapons amd combos that you can do in combat.   The controls are a bit different and can take some getting used to if you are familiar with Terraria, Starbound, or Edge of Space. HOWEVER - this game actually works very very well with a controller where its peers seem to fail.  There are bugs and yes on some systems there are memory leak issues. The netowrk framework for multiplayer could use some work as it seems to be crashing people or renders the game unplayable.   Personally I have not had any issues with this game and really enjoy it.

You will have to google pretty often for core game mechanics, item recipies etc.  2. UI is as bad as it can be. It's unintuitive, overcomplicated, unfriendly, poorly documented and inconsistent. It's a constant pain and struggle. 3. Forget diversity. The game is pretty monotonous. Even soundtrack only has a single main theme. There is nothing like Terraria events or Starbound quests, 4. The skills system that is advertised as an advantage over Terraria/Starbound/Minecraft is in fact not sweet at all. Many skills are useles: some of them will be irrelevant for you because you follow one specific skill build (e.g. warrior, not mage). Another reason why having many skills is not cool is UI: there is almost no way one will use more than 3-5 active skills. And there is casting delay. And there is stamina cost. Bottom line is that skills system is not fun at all.",

These and many other bugs convinced me to not reccommend this game. Although, if itdont frustrates you fully by teleporting you into a dongen where you are fully trapped and have no hope to flee, it is a great geame, so, if you have any ideas how to overcome those bugs, go ahead and play the game :D (and please tell me how to overcome the listed bugs)",

            "review_text": "I originally gave this game a negative review, but that was a mistake. I found that exploring and terraforming (digging a lot everywhere) was my key aspect. The main developer (Jasson) was very kind and honest about asking me questions about my review. This game, however, is still progressing, but so far it is just amazing. Now, I will move onto the pros and cons that I have thought of.  Pros:  - Developers are very kind and nice, (I have read forums and I have seen Jasson and a few others responding, which I thought was very generous.)  - Has a great RPG style, with its variety of abilities, armors, and weapons of choice.  - Exploring and digging were 2 of my favorite parts about this game, because that's just the type of player I am in games.  - Bosses are actually tough no matter how far you are in the game, which adds for a neat challenge, where you will actually have to strategically find the pattern of the bosses attacks and learn how to avoid them.  - Game has much variety. (Ores, weapons, armors, etc.)  - Weapons/Armor/Tools do not break, which got me about 11.50% more into this game.  - Artwork is very cool.   Cons:  - Still in progress, just needs more bosses and enemies. But, it is an early access game, so it really doesn't matter.  - Grinding sometimes takes a while and is lengthy, but the reward you get is great.  - Game is a bit slow, in terms of framerate (but once again, early access. As long as it works, I'm good.)  - Researching is a bit tedious, due to having to use materials to research items that use those materials.  Overall, this game is still progressing, but what it is with right now is just absolutely great. The developers and community are also amazing. Overall, just an amazing game as it is. 8.7/10",
