            "review_text": "Ravenmark Scourge of Estellion is an excellent tactical strategy game with any number of different possibilities in terms of combat. The combat is layered quite deep, as is the exception lore of the gameworld itself. In truth, the Codex itself that comes with the game is worth the price alone. I had the good fortune of receiving an early review copy from the folks of Slitherine. Ive played quite awhile and haven't even cracked the surface of the game. The combat system of the game relies heavily on Hero abilties, as well as 'anticipation' in Ravenmark you don't directly attack the enemy, you move a unit adjacent to an enemy unit, or where you think they will be, there is a good chance they'll manage to get out of your way due to a combat ability, etc. Below I have provided a wonderful battle from one of my streams that I like to call 'Battle of the Trojan Caravan' so as not to give away spoilers I won't be telling you how far into the game this is, but let's just say on the scale of battles this would be considered miniscule. As the game progresses battles become truly massive affairs, with multiple armies facing off for one ultimate goal, total domination of Estellion.

            "review_text": "well to be honest its what youd expect from the publishers slitherine  somewhat harder than id like  the battles are more like puzzles as you try to solve how to win them   the lore and story background are very well done and the visuals are really clean and well done. i havent given up on it yet but you need to be a strategy guy/ gal to play this   i will reccomend it but beware the caveat its a strategy game and slitherine publish it !!",

            "review_text": "(I'm playing offline that's why it seems I haven't played much)  Nice and often challenging game for those who, like me, like this type of game (turned based strategy in heroic fantasy).  Its main default, in my opinion, is that it is linear so you are stuck on a level as long as you don't find a way to succeed it (you can't pass the level, you have to succeed it somehow) : The Devs should have allowed to pass any level after 3 failed attempts or something like that, in order to avoid being stucked on a level you find too difficult... which can kill the fun of the game.",

            "review_text": "When I saw the videos and description of Ravenmark, I thought I had stumbled on another hidden gem like Valkyria Chronicles. Alas, there are not much hidden gems and most times you will just pick up another little pebble. Ravenmark is such a disapointment that looked good at first glance.   A warning should have been the fact that Ravenmark is an iOS port. While that doesn't mean that it automatically has to be a bad game, there are still some implications that come along with it. Games for portable devices almost always don't want to bother the player with decisions that he made in earlier stages of the game. Concerning an RPG or strategy game, this effectively means that there are most likely no player choices to be made like specialising the skills of your units, upgrade units after a battle and carry it over to the next or RPG-choices that affect the course of the story. In short, you can expect that everything that adds salt and pepper to a RPG or strategy game will be left out. This, sadly, is the case with Ravenmark.  The following list rates the different aspects of the game using a scale from very bad (---) to very good (+++):   Stability/Bugs: +++   No bugs or stability issues encountered. Good job.  RPG-aspects: -  The story is a railroad slideshow without any interaction or possibility to make choices by the player. The characters are flat and either unmotivated good, bad and/or naive. Sometimes there's a voice narration of the character's conversations, which is nice.  Tactical aspects: +  You can give direct commands only to a maximum of six units during any given turn, while you will have at most times more than six units of yours on the battlefield. You can group units together and these new formations can be commanded with only a single command. Unfortunately, formations will often times not do or will not be able to do what you've ordered them to. All in all the tactical aspects are okay and the formation system adds a nice new idea to the genre.  Strategic-aspects: ---  There are simply no strategic decisions to be made. You can't upgrade units or characters, you can't decide which units to bring into battle, you can't decide on which terrain to fight, you have no choices regarding infrastructure, unit supply, economics or whatsoever.  Price: -  Considering the fact, that this is an iOS port, 15 € comes pretty close to a rip-off. With the lack of RPG-decisions and no strategic value, Ravenmark comes down to a casual game with some boring slideshow story. Honestly said, I wouldn't want to pay money for that no matter the cost.",
