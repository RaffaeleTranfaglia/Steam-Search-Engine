Content up to VoA ( Veil of Alaris ) can be accessed for free, and characters can obtain up to level 95 ( without gold or purchase of the latest expansion ). It's never been easier to pick up, and catch up.  Whether returning for nostalgia, or coming into the game for the first time, Everquest still has something to offer. There are plenty of guilds available, group and raid content, and solo opportunities for any class you're willing to invest in.",

Most EQ vets I know either laugh at you or wince with pain when you tell them you want to start a new character on a new account. Grinding from 1 to 90+ solo is an extremely daunting task even as the best solo class in the game, necro. Sony tried to make the grind a little more solo friendly with the addition of mercs and more forgiving solo zones, but as free to play, you can only use tier 1 or 2 mercs, which are not that great. You are also limited to 250 AAs max as free to play which is extremely limiting when you do get to that point in the game.  The world is big. The quests are epic (especially the ones to get your epic weapons). Possibly the most important, the people are civil and helpful. Get into a guild ASAP.",

            "review_text": "May 2016 is actually my first experience with Everquest, so this review should give you an insight about the game unrelated to the Nostalgia most of the players play for. My personal MMORPG background is just Vanilla World of Warcraft (2004-2006).  Pros: - A huge amount of content, more than a thousand zones and a big choice of where to lvl in. - Very friendly and mature community. - Runs well on pretty much any computer, my girlfriend runs it on a Microsoft Surface 3 with no problems and that is actually a Windows tablet with an atom processor and no dedicated GPU. - The Free2Play model pretty much doesnt restrict you till lvl 50 which should give you an idea about the game and wether you want to sub to it.  Cons: - The UI is a total cluster♥♥♥♥ and it requires more than just patience to figure out. It is in fact so off putting that I would say that this is the biggest flaw of Everquest. - Everquest is absolutly not casual... When you plan to play say an hour in the eve, half of it will be spent just figuring out which spells/skills you need to take with you to an adventure (there are literaly hundreds even in low lvls). - Quests are incredibly hard to do without the help of the internet, it takes ages to figure out where is what npc and what exactly should one give to whom and from where. - Graphics and animations are pretty bad (1999 Engine) but atleast the game runs well on almost any kind of hardware.  Conclusion: - For a casual experience probably not. - For a more deep experience or even just to see how MMORPGs used to be, it is definetly worth a try.  - Server wise, I recommend you to start in Firiona Vie (RP), it seems to be one of the more active ones.",

Sometimes you would spend weeks camping a mob for aa chance at a drop.

This is the game that started me in MMO's 16 years ago, and iv been on and off it ever since.I would like to warn 'newschool' mmo players that this is nothing like WoW and if u like WoW u will prob not like EQ, bc its not an easy game, and u have to work hard for your levels n gear. If u start playing now there is a progression server that just opened up a couple months ago that the masses just joined, so there is plenty of people to game with at all levels, its def worth it. This game will always be the one that got me into gaming, the memories i had and the people i met in the game made it worth the massive amount of hours i put into it. So try EQ if u like a challenge and a oldschool feel. Id also recommend using the oldschool graphics, they are better imo.",

Their security on accounts is a joke and long time CEO has step down due to lizardsquad openly hacking them.   Game was a great back in the day thing, but now that the last and final expansion (21 overall) is out for a year now with barely any new content unless you want to overpay for it.    Expect no more then a cash grab and lackluster experience with really no new players joining/playing and just the diehards left holding on or finishing whats left of content they havent experienced, and they rather watch people struggle then help. By the time you would be at that level 105 / 10k AA the game will be closed up. Oh just to mention as well enjoy adds popping up in the middle of combat if your going free to play every 10minutes.  I played in a top 5 guild until i retired before this expansion, so please take my word for it, game is great if your in a top 5 guild other then that i wouldnt recommend it as you will never experience the top end content as far as raids go without struggling mightly.   I would recommend Project99 at this point as that version is free to play(no adds/paywalls on gear) and has a better community overall, not to mention have signed an agreement with SoE/Daybreak so they wont be shut down. They are also releasing Velious so much fun.",

This game takes time and isn't as action packed as all the newer games coming out, so don't expect much from a game that has been out for as many years as this one. It is confusing when you just start playing, but it is a massive game with 16 classes to choose from, and so many zones that I doubt you will ever see them all. I was introduced to this game by my dad and played with my brother and him, so I guess I'm a little biased but it's still annoying af to see people going in thinking it's gonna be a new MMO. (Yes, it does advertise premium but you can exit out of the small pop-up with a click, and as for the premium, you literally don't need it for anything if you just want to play the game) Also, I have a LOT more hours than this outside of steam.",

Free 2 play in a nutshell in everquest: - You can't do much in a guild excepted join one - Can't sell anything in the bazar, you're restricted in buying so you're pretty much stuck with your newby gear. Which sucks because you cannot really make money if you cannot sell your things in the bazar first. -You're restricted to 2 character. Not really that bad. -You cannot play on TLP servers and experience the first contents of the game -You will have a hard time leveling if you don't have a good merc to tank mobs. Yes, there is ranked mercs, and in F2P, only rank 1 and 2 are available, but they are bad. Upper ranks are the only good mercs to be able to tank anything correctly and without much trouble. AND there isn't much people in low levels that you can group with to level up.  In a nutshell: Want to play normally and be able to progress on your character without much trouble? Then pay.",

This game is the one that was the most rewarding. Yeah, it punished you for error. It took your time, took your money, took your loot and so on. That's kind of like real life too, so it was relatable. I was hooked. In this game, you truly feel like you are that race, trained as that class you choose to play. A warrior does not heal, like in other MMO's unless you cound bindwound (using bandaids) as healing. A cleric does amazing heals and laughable damage, not topping dps meters because actual dps classes are slacking. Want to be an Iksar necromancer? Be prepared to be the most hated race and class in the game. Not even your own faction likes you. It is the only game that I think truly gives a unique relationship with each race and class that no MMO has touched since they've entered the scene.

Which may seem boring but actually in my opinion adds a lot of depth/decision making depending on the characters you play. The game is old, very old, but any information you seek on it is available. A huge problem I notice when I play with new players is they do not have the maps downloaded, if you do not have the maps downloaded getting around the world can be a struggle. Some may welcome the challenge of having no map. I would advise any new players to pick a class with access to pets/summons. These classes generally fair well on their own early on and later into the game, this allows you to learn the mechanics of the game. Everquest used to be fairly punishing if you died in game you had to do a corpse run to retrieve all of your hard earned gear, nowadays its just a loss of experience unless you make the corpse run or pay a npc to summon it for you. Once you hit about level 50 (max lvl is 110 w/ expansion) in game which should take you a few days you will need to decide if you want to pay the subscription fee to gain access to features such as 'AA' alternate abilitys, some of these are passive increases and others are active skills. Sadly you need access to these for much later gameplay to be effective in level appropriate content.  Overall I would give the game a try If you really like its core mechanics and have kept in mind it is one of the oldest games and ofcourse one of the oldest mmo's and you have read this far and still do not like the concept of paying a sub fee to enjoy the full game. I would advise you to look into Pantheon Rise of the Fallen a new MMO with old concepts Side note, I have much more time than listed dumped into this game :P",
