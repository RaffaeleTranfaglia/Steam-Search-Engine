            "review_text": "I am a long time player of Blood Bowl, starting with the 2nd edition of the tabletop game, through to the nineties MS-DOS computer game, to not-Blood-Bowl-honest Chaos League and finally Blood Bowl 1/Legendary/Chaos. The thing I loved about Blood Bowl 1 was the single player options, from creating a custom league, to participating in a classic competition from Blood Bowl canon, and of course even playing a proper full career, clawing your way up the rankings over the years, up against all the famous classic teams of Blood Bowl lore, winning cups and trophies along the way until eventually, hopefully, winnng the Blood Bowl trophy itself.  Now comes Blood Bowl 2; the graphics are prettier, but graphics aren't everything. The part that matters to me, the gameplay, the thing I loved in Blood Bowl 1 is... gone. The single player campaign is a shadow of what it was before. You can create a custom league, but there are no proper tournaments from Blood Bowl canon, and certainly no proper career. You play a few games in a single tournament, and then you are done. And the classic teams don't even appear in these leagues anymore. The whole thing is clearly obsessed with multiplayer, to the point that even in single player games the game still looks, feels and plays just like the multiplayer version, with randomised AI team creations clearly trying to pass themselves off as player teams. But it doesn't work. To take examples, the Broad Axes team might have the emblem of a Bugman's tankard, while Bugman's Faithful might have the emblem of an axe. Eh? It's randomisation gone mad. It makes no sense. And as I said, there are no Reikland Reivers or Gouged Eye or Chaos All Stars. Unless you play the introductory 'tutorial', or single one off matches without continuity, you will never see the classic teams of Blood Bowl lore at all. That's just not good enough. For me, without the ability to play a league or proper career with your own team against the classic sides of history, the appeal just isn't there.   And there are other disappointments. You can't improve/modify a player's armour any more. Many of the other options of old just aren't available. The font is - to my eyes - some horrible thin eyesore - and the UI just ugly, literally not pleasing on the eyes. Meanwhile the commentators Jim and Bob now insist on actually appearing, but just get in the way. In short, while this game might be a multiplayer's paradise, it doesn't work for me. Maybe Blood Bowl 1 spoiled me, but to my mind Blood Bowl 2 is several steps backwards.  Now this might sound like I'm some kind of hater. But I am a fan of Blood Bowl and for the sake of the franchise I sincerely hope that people out there are enjoying this, and I wish the game very well. I do want this to succeed. But the single player aspect desperately needs work. The single player game is an opportunity to offer players content that multiplayer content cannot provide - such as a proper career. But it simply doesn't. For me personally, Blood Bowl 2 is a big disappointment, and until the single player game is improved I will be sticking with Blood Bowl 1, because unfortunately, for solo play, Blood Bowl 1 remains far superior.",

            "review_text": "So, I can't recommend this game for several reasons. Although Blood Bowl is a really fun blend of strategy and RNG, the implementation of this is poor. Single player is OK - the campaign is just an extended tutorial, and not actually challenging. Although the commentators are mildly entertaining and most games the AI has some gimmick to keep you interested, its clear the game is geared towards multiplayer.   Unfortunately, multiplayer is awful. Matchmaking times are ridiculously long, and the longer you're in queue, the less the game cares about an even matchup. Using petty cash to even out the odds is inadequate to really level the playing field and allow a fair competitve match. Furthermore the game doesn't use MMR - matchmaking is determined by you're teams gold value, not winrate. So player skill isn't taken into account and experienced players with low TV teams destroy any newer players. Also since there's no real incentive to win, and no penalty for conceding, the leagues are infested with Chaos teams whose sole aim is to kill and injure your players. If you try to injure their players back in return, they'll just concede. Also, the main league - NAF - has ageing on for some reason, which is a stupid rule. All your prized players you spend ages levelling up will eventually retire.   Other complaints include a shoddy UI, a distinct lack of teams compared to the previosd Blood Bowl, and the devs being very slow to update the game or add new content. They also seem unwilling to actually balance the game, and allow CPOMB teams to run rampant in every league, which is completely anti-fun. The game itself also runs very poorly, with low framerate and really long animations that are unskippable and leave you unable to do anything while the animation plays out. Often you will run out of time each turn because the game runs so badly. Games also last too long - 16 turns each at 2minutes per turn is 1hr 12mins for turn timers, however ONTOP of that is time for animations/cutscenes ansd kickoff/events/injuries. The entire game feels like it needs to be sped up. For the full price its definitely not worth it. If you're a hardcore Blood Bowl fan and don't mind playing against Chaos/Nurgle every match then maybe pick it up on sale.",

            "review_text": "Bloodbowl itself is weird to recommend. It's something you have to try to see if you like it, but ask yourself these three questions first  Do you like strategy games? If no, don't get this, this is more strategy than sport. Are you not okay with permadeath, Don't get it, your players who are amazing will eventually die. (X-com level of trauma). Are you not okay with losing due to bad luck? Don't get it, because chance will screw you.  This leaves the question, should you get Bloodbowl 1 or Bloodbowl 2  Bloodbowl 2 is like two steps forward and one step backwards.   Graphics are obviously better than the first one.  The UI has improved in some aspects, percentages are shown instead of forcing the player to know the rules. However grids on the field are missing, as well as the quick overview of the roles of the players. This is quite annoying since some different players can look the same.  Tutorial is also way better than BB1, it's slow but it explains the game fairly well. The other single player content is lacking though, so you will mainly be playing this multiplayer. I recommend joining a private league though, as the normal matchmaking is flawed, due to some teams being clearly better in that format. These are easy to find in the steam forums. The community is way bigger, so you will find matches much faster, about 30 seconds, instead of the 15 minutes in BB1. Difference in the amount of teams is quite big though. 10 in BB2 while there are 24 in BB1.  That said the ten teams in BB2 are all of relatively equal strength, with one maybe being weaker than the rest. Whereas at least 6 six teams in BB1 are deliberately weaker. The advantage of ten players however is that it is easier for new players to learn strategies against the different teams.   So, I would say that for a new player bloodbowl 2 is better, but I would still wait for a sale.",

            "review_text": "I see a lot of negative reviews from people who have played the original blood bowl games which I can't comment on due to BB2 being my first experience of the game, all I can say is that I love it, if I've got free time it's my first, second and third choice, and if I'm not playing I'm watching a stream :)  Pros:   1. Incredibly deep gameplay/strategy, after 600 hours I still feel like a noob, every team can be developed differently according to how you like to play, and more than half the teams haven't been released yet so still plenty of variety to come.   2. The game looks great and the UI is mostly excellent with some occasionally annoying exceptions which the developer has been regularly but slowly fixing.  3. The community. This is the best thing by far, Bloodbowl isn't a game with a huge player base but it seems like once you start playing you don't stop, a huge amount of strategy guides available, all the streams I've seen have a very welcoming chat and once you feel like you've got a grasp of the basics there are a lot of private leagues with some really good and friendly players.  Cons:  1. Steep learning curve with a not great match making system can lead to some impossible games when you're just starting out, the tutorial will teach you the basics, but very slowly, I'd recommend watching some streamers and asking questions in chat over playing the tutorial, and when you search for a game stopping and starting the search every ten seconds or so will help to avoid the more ridiculously impossible match ups.  2. Time. Games can take over an hour to play, there's no speed mode so if you don't have that kind of time then this isn't the game for you.  3. Salt. Everything in this game is decided on the roll of a dice, there will absolutely be times when you know you're playing someone who isn't close to being as good as you but he'll wreck you because he'll get every dice roll his way. The better you are the better you will be able to allow for the variance but sometimes you're going to be left disgusted.  4. No competitive rankings. There's nothing currently like the ladder in hearthstone to judge yourself by, the main match making league is perpetual so really you have to join private leagues to find proper competition. Cyanide have put up prizes for a world cup competition but reallistaically only the very best players have a chance of qualifying for that, definitely my biggest problem with the game currently.",

            "review_text": "It's pretty, I'll give it that. And I imagine in a year or two it will be solid. But much like BB1 was at launch Bloodbowl 2 is far from a complete game. Putting aside the fact that they don't have goblins or halflings (which is sort of a dealbreaker for me right off the bat) the lack of fullscreen (You can play borderless window at full resolution, but that overtaxes some hardware) makes it almost unplayable and little things like no armor upgrades and lack of a true solo campaign (you can play in a solo league but it is noteably less awesome than the solo campaign in 1 where there was a map and more of a sense of a world and story) make the game just lacking in gameplay compared to Chaos Edition.  So here's what it comes down to. If you're a hardcare blood bowl player and you want to support the studio so they can continue to imrpove this game and utlimately have 2 as full featured (or hopefully more) as one, then buy it. It definitely has promise and my family bought 3 copies for this reason.  If you don't already have Chaos Edition it really comes down to what's most important to you. If it's graphics then by all means, get II!  If it's gameplay... well I honestly can't bring myself to recommend II over Chaos Edition... yet. Chaos has had years to polish things and has 23 races compared to 8 here. Which is really frustrating for me because I have friends I'd like to get into BloodBowl. But since I myself will be sticking with Chaos Edition until they've added some key things like fullscreen, more races, and a better single player experience, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this over Chaos, particularly given that Chaos is cheaper.",

I have owned the table top Blood Bowl since 1986 and have avidly played Blood Bowl Chaos edition and with the graphics, the smoothness of play and the promise of a better AI and more management tools this seemed like it would be the best thing ever. IT IS NOT.  Blood Bowl 2 is at best ready for an extended beta-release, the number of game play bugs pile up by the day and Cyanide seems to have abandoned the support forums. There is no word on any of the many,many,many too numerous to fix bugs are being worked on and there is no acknowledgement from Cyanide that anything to fix Blood Bowl 2 is happening.  Add that to the inexplicable changes to races/players, beefed up human catchers that have no cost increase, impotent Chaos Warriors and an AI that can only win if it stacks the die rolls impossibly in it's favor and this game is a sham that shouldn't even be called Blood Bowl.  Add to that Cyanides ignoring of the LRB and their seemingly pointless tinkering at minor rules and gameplay instead of focusing on fixing the numerous bugs and this game mystifies as to why it was released.  I want to love this game, but I don't and I find myself frustrated at something that could have been so good so inexplicably ruined. I think the only thing that could save this game is to take it out of Cyanides hands, they have completely lost the script.  Unless you have never played any other iteration of Blood Bowl, or if you hated the other versions do not buy this game.  UPDATE: I'm really, really trying to love this game, I've added another 22 hours of game play and if anything it is buggier last week and this week than it was before.  Unlike other players I've never had crashes, just annoying game play bugs, but now the game is 'Black Screening' about 45% of the time. You can hear the game going on and see the cursor but the screen is blank and windows shows the game as 'Not Responding' it's been happening to lots of players and the BB2 support forums have multiple multi post threads about it and SURPRISE! No input from Cyanide at all.  Game Devs: Read these reviews closely, this how you destroy a uch loved, highly anticipated game.",

Until you actually figure out how to play. And this is where I think most people are at when it comes to Bloodbowl. They get a couple of Double skulls, and from there decide that the game is bull****.   And than there are those who would argue that Bloodbowl 2 is not as good as previous Video Game versions. Which in all honesty is accurate. This game is indeed lacking in MANY options that previous games had including extra Online League Options, Singleplayer Campaigns, Races and various Thematic elements such as Racial specific Cheerleaders, differences in armor for higher level players, etc.   However, the reason I am recommending this game is because dispite all of the downsides, it has one very big upside. Graphics.  Now I know many are already thinking 'Graphics don't make games good! Gameplay does!' And while that is most certainly true in many cases, it's a bit like saying that you shouldn't buy a new better looking version of Chess because it's no different. The Gameplay of Chess is NEVER going to change, so in essence if you have the choice between a videogame adaptation that looks like crap vs one that doesn't, which are you going to get?   Now I am in NO way disregarding the fact that the content of this game is not all that great in comparison to older Bloodbowl games, Especially in the Singleplayer experience. What I am saying is that the better graphics do make it a more enjoyable game overall.   Now if you are someone who is interested in getting into Bloodbowl in general this is a very good jumping off point. The UI is clean, very few bugs, and the Graphics are pleasing to the eyes.   Bloodbowl is an amazingly fun Risk Management game and Bloodbowl 2 is a great adaption of it. But keep in mind that buying this game for it's Singleplayer experience is a bad idea. But if you're like me who got it to play with/against friends and Random internet people it is most certainly worth it.",

All about the spirit and the fun comes from fighting other Players, its all about Strategy, Tactic and a bit of Luck some times. ( Its a Dice Game after all)  But first things first - Is BB2 better than BB1?  Kind of, yes. BB2 has a much better look all over the place, the UI is more Userfriendly, the presentation of the stadiums and the teams is awesome, it plays smoother and is just more enjoyable than BB1.  And there are so cool details they added, for example if you purchase a Bloodweiser Stand for your Stadium, the crowd is much more pushed and the sound effects of your fans cheering changes aswell, more singing and Vuvuselas all over the place, nice!  The graphics are great, with cool beating animations and close up cameras if something important happens, really cool and it delivers a nice feeling of being close to the Action.  So the Game itself, the Programming and Graphics are much better than BB1.  The most common reason for negative reviews is the lack of Content it has at the Moment. And that in fact is true, BB1 has much more Content to deliver, but you need to consider that BB1 already has 2 Addons, and compared to the Base Game the Content is the same.  A few not gamebreaking but important things missing aswell, and hopfully will be added soon. The Game lacks in case of Informations, for example no Hall of Fame for your Team, no Player Statistics, no information about Opposing Team pre Match, no Visual change of high lvl Players and so on.  In my opinion it seems they just where running out of time to implement all those things before release, and im very confident that they will add that kind of things the next few Months.  Additional Teams will be delivered saperatly as a DLC for 6,99$ each as far is i know, what is a fair price because the teams are really looking awesome.  So for everybody new to Bloodbowl, BB2 is the better choice. Because it has a better UI and a Singleplayer Campaign wich is in fact a large Tutorial.  To the Bloodbowl Veterans out there, you want to buy and play Bloodbowl 2 for the same reasons, you played BB1 instead of Fumble. If you want all the Content the BB Lore will offer and all the Statistics and information Possible, play Fumble, its free after all.

Your opponents will try their best to kill your best players, to destroy you, to crush you, and sometimes, to score. But if you hang on, you'll get the hang of it. You will start winning your games. You will CRUSH YOUR ENNEMIES.  There are obviously some cons; as of now, a lot of teams are not implemented, and cyanide took some liberties with teams that were not appreciated by a vocal portions of the players. But the game is getting more and more updates, teams and things are changing. Now is the time to get the game (50% off) and get the next 4 teams for free. You won't get the dlc teams, and that's disappointing, but you don't really NEED them to play the game (or even to be good at it). ",

Sure, you can lose badly because of unlucky rolls, but that´s Blood Bowl and how it always has been. If you don´t like that, then this is not a game for you.

There's a ton of hidden depth to the strategy and a lot of it isn't very clearly explained by the game's campaign/tutorial, and true to any Games Workshop property, it relies on a lot of chaotic rolls of the dice. If you're not willing to see your star player roll snake eyes on a two-dice block against a teeny Goblin, knocking your player over instead of the wee Gobbo, potentially KILLING your star player if his armor breaks, then this is not a game for you.  However! If you're the sort of player who knows how to mitigate risk, is willing to learn a slightly clunky game system right out of the 80's, and can revel in the utter chaos that this game creates, then this is an absolute joy to play. It's a mix of Rugby, American Football, and Warhammer Fantasy's own special brand of SENSELESS VIOLENCE. Describing it in text isn't quite sufficient; I'd highly recommend watching cKnoor's videos on Youtube if you want to see a pro play, or you could watch WOWCrendor's Crendorian Invitational if you want to see just what kinds of wonderfully dumb tight spots the dice can get you into.  Pray to Nuffle that your dice be blessed, strap on your helmet, and drive your skull into the gut of an Ork.",

Time stands still as the Dwarves lock their beady little eyes onto me, their hunger for the ball in my hands is almost palpable.

While Blood Bowl 2 doesn't have all the races, it has most of the higher tier races and still enough variety that I haven't played through all of them yet myself. Here are some of the things that I appreciate that may not be obvious from seeing the trailers and screenshots.  1. The ability to rewind, pause, and skip in replays. 2.

Proper implementation of rolls like break tackle 5. Option to use of dodge when being pushed to the sideline (though not available in the case of One turn touchdowns)  Some things that I would like to see.  1.

If not, I'd imagine it's pretty close!)  Do you have a gambling problem? This is the game for you. If you want a game that you will always win, keep moving. If, however, you want a punishing title that will sometimes make you scream for bad dice rolls, you found it. I think that's the charm of Blood Bowl 2. You could be royally screwed over on a dice roll that there was no reason to lose, yet so could your opponent. This game sometimes makes losing both fun and hilarious!  Blood Bowl 2 is a mashup between the Games Workshop high fantasy universe and American football. It is turn based and your turn continues until you are finished moving players or you make a mistake and one of your players goes down or misses a catch (a turnover.)   Each of your players has stats that determine movement range, number of dice rolled when blocking, catching, etc. The system is perfectly balanced and easy to understand. I find it very simple to estimate odds on the fly.   Want a football game where players can be injured or killed? You're looking at it! I once played a game where my opponent only had three or four players left (total is always 11 with reserves.) Best part about the injuries (or worst, depending on perspective) is that they can stick with your players permanently. Death is also permanent. It's not all bad, though, as your players level up and can pick new skills or stats. My favorite part of the game and absolutely crucial in multiplayer.  Speaking of multiplayer, there are official and user-created leagues and I haven't once found myself unable to locate an opponent. Multiplayer makes this game one of my favorites and I highly recommend it, even to people not into sports.   Single player campaign seems fun, though I was bored of playing humans so I haven't completed it. It does appear to be short, perhaps meant as a way for new players to quickly learn the game.  I give this game a 9/10. I can't wait to see some new races added to the mix. I'm also looking forward to the opening of the trading markets, where you can put players on the market and I think purchase others. Great fun!

It's entirely too frustrating to try and play a game with a new or new-ish team only to get matched with an opponent with 500+ more Team Value than myself. This has happened consistently, with one of my Chaos teams having gotten no less than 3 opponents with team values in the 1500-1850 range in a row. While I was sub 1300 for at least two of those. Game is fine if you've got a group of friends and do an in-house league where you start off on the same foot and keep relative pace with one another, but trying to play in any public league is maddening for the reason above.   Once they fix that, I'll change to recommending the game as it's not a bad revised version thus far even if it has less overall content than BB1: Chaos Edition at the time of this writing. It shows promise, it just needs some kinks worked out. The most major of which to me is the matchmaking.",

I also have a ridiculous # of hours logged with the previous game. While I'm no expert on the game, here are some changes I've noticed in comparison to BB1:   - Gold in your treasury adds to the TV once you have more than 150K. Initially I didn't like this, however now I find myself much more willing to purchase inducements that exceed petty-cash values in matches, and this truly adds to the gameplay. More importantly, I am no longer afraid to fill out a team roster with reserves. I think this was a great decision from the developer.  - Team management is more robust. You have an upgradeable home-stadium. Player transfers / market is a feature (was not live during beta). All in all, teams feel like they have more of a life and identity.   - Chances on action success are shown in a % tooltip. This will help players that don't initially understand the dice system (hey, I'm sure they exist). But moreover, it just helps with making quick choices in context.  - The league system / interface appears to be better designed.  - The standard grid overlay (which you could toggle on and off in the last game) is gone. In its place, there is a contextual grid on each player you select. It's not distracting and functions perfectly well. You now see a numeric indication of stacked tackle zones on any given tile.  - Animation and gameplay feels more life-like / brutal, and fun!  - The controls will feel strange at first. There is an option to toggle BB1 controls, and the BB1 camera (I recommend). Though the BB2 controls may work just fine for some, and the BB2 camera is actually enjoyable once you're comfortable with strategy.  - You're no longer tied to your opponent's cutscenes. For those that remember from the first game, an angry player would remain idle at keyboard while you were spamming 'Esc.'. This is handled much better.  - The dice / roll log was limited. You see current roll results at the bottom of the interface. Hopefully a full log will be visible in the future.  - The visible armor changes that occurred when a player leveled up, seem to have been cut. I thought it was a neat feature of the first game. (Not to be mistaken with mutations, which are visible after acquired).  - The game occassionally crashes / becomes unresponsive immediately after launching into a new match (loading screen).  That's it for now. Definitely worth a buy!",

And to that I ask, did you play it multiplayer? I have no idea how many times we had unstable games there, the game would just crash, hits didn't feel like they had an impact, the UI was pretty bad. This is much better in those aspects, and for me personally that is enough for me to say that I feel like this price is ok for this game.  It really depends if you like this kind of game or not, ofc if you don't really enjoy this kind of game, you WILL feel ripped off, if you like it, then you have no qualms with it.

After playing the first matches I cannot recommend to buy this, but rather to stay with or try out the BB1: Chaos edition.  Some reasons for this recommendation are: - As usual many races (teams) are missing from this first version of BB2 - Even less pre-generated teams than in BB1:CE (only three per race) - The options for customization of graphics and controls is limited / non existing. - The language selection is limited to english and french (not a point of major critics but still less options than in BB1:CE). - Some other features from the 6 year old BB1 are missing: most prominient the team editor - I cannot customize a team to use e.g. in a friendly match by adjusting its team value, its players skills and equipment - no possibility to change camera perspective during the match.

The UI is much better. Graphics are vastly improved. My most favourite feature is Cabal TV, where one can watch replays of games played by other players in the community. A lot of multiplayer games tend to miss out on this feature and I am glad it was implemented here. And yes it is leaning towards multiplayer competitive online play. There are single player competitions you can create against the AI if you like. But the main fun is joining one of the open leagues and playing human opponents.

This new version is a disappointment, but it does have good things: it's nice looking and has awesome slow motion views of the hits. That's it.  And now the bad things. The user interface (generally speaking) is terrible: in many cases, you can´t tell some positionals apart (eg. dark elf linemen, blitzers, runners) and it's really annoying clicking through all your players to find the one you're looking for... Then, when you are getting hit, you sometimes don`t know which player it is, making the use of your ability Stand Firm, for example, a game of guessing if you want to use it or not. And it's terribly annoying to have to put you mouse cursor over every ability icon on the player's stat card to know what abilities he has (why not have it be text like in BB1?).   Also when playing, you don't have the sound cues you had in BB1 to know when it's your turn. It's easy to not realize, the opposing player has finished his turn and the timer is running against you...  For some strange reason, you can no longer see your team's stats (or your's as a coach). You can only see games won.  Also, for some strange reason, the rules aren't the same as in the first game (or the tabletop game): human catchers don't have the same stats, you don't have to declare a pass at the begining of the players action, etc.  And then: 7€ per race?! Come on...  Oh, and I'm Spanish but had to change the language to English; the translation is terrible.",

First off, This game is truly an amazing and fun game when, well, it wants to be. Matches only have two turnouts: Either the opposing team gets COMPLETELY screwed by 'rng' or your team gets COMPLETELY screwed by rng. There is such a low level of strategy and skill in this game that such a brutal rng system really hurts the game at times. I am talking, turn 1, You injure two of your enemies immediately and stun another and knockdown the rest. While that will be fun for you, the other player is probably bashing their head against the wall. Vice versa, turn 1, your strongest player has a 3 dice roll, and gets 3 skulls. Reroll and get 3 MORE skulls. Those rng chances seem like they would only happen once in a blue moon, but they truly happen essentially every game. At this point you are probably thinking, 'Man you probably just suck git gud'. Well, maybe you are right, but rng aside, the games teams aren't exactly balanced either. The game basically consists of Chaos, Elves, and Lizardmen. Any other race stands no chance against their versatility and stopping power. Norse are a heavy contestant but just not good enough at times. The matches are either incredibly long winded or instant concedes. I have had this game since launch and only recently reinstalled this rage fest, to discover, I am uninstalling it again. Your only chances of enjoying this are if you have a HIGH HIGH tolerance to rage, or you are an extreme masochist and enjoy the agony of devastating rng. But, for me, it's a no. I'd give it a 6/10. Buy it on sale to try it, but never full price.",

I could go on and on and on with the stupidity that happens in this game. It has potential but with the stupidity that happens (which I think the Devs were thinking it would be funny) it simply ruins any aspect of tactics involved and turns the game into some wierd form of constant dice roll chance and unforseen mishaps that ruin the play.",

I'm not a big review-writer, so only one example which frustrates me the most: - Picking up the ball Like seriously, it shouldn't be that hard to pick up a ball as the thrower which is right besides you (after kick-off). I only logged the last 8 trys and (including re-rolls) I managed to pick up the ball 1 single time while the chance was always at 67%. Like a lot of others have written already, the odds/dice are way off because the AI lacks the I(ntelligence).  It's fun to watch the short scenes which are pretty brutal to me since I'm more the strategy type of gamer (Paradox titles mostly) but that's it already. I might play it every now and then when I need a rest from real strategy games because it doesn't involve much brain to play since strategy isn't helping you much anyway when the next roll is off again.",
