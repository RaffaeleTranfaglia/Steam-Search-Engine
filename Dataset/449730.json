As a game where the whole point is to Google the answers, the research-based puzzles are certainly unique.  The true benefit to this game, however, is a massive ARG, sitting at the most paranormal edge of the TBW universe.  In short, if you liked The Black Watchmen, you will like Ahnayro, but don't expect anything close to the same experience.",
