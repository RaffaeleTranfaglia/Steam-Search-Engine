            "review_text": " Tim tries Viking Squad: 1. Projectile Penguins ft. Blake!   Viking Squad is a wonderful little side-scrolling brawler filled with Nordic goodness from stem to stern. Everything from the soundtrack to the taunts you can lay down feel very appropriate to the theme, the controls are incredibly tight and handle exactly like you'd expect, but there are a few bits of polish gone into this game that most brawlers overlook. First off, the lanes are locked in. I know this sounds like a bad thing, but if you've ever been frustrated about an attack just missing because you aren't on the 'aren't plane,' you'll be happy to know that instead of walking between lanes, you hop amongst them, meaning that once you are in the lane, you're in it to win it. There is no space between lanes, there is no chance to miss, there is just good, clean hits. Second, there are TONS of little bits of polish to look for, the backgrounds are super detailed and interesting, and every inch of the world just seems... alive. It feels really great going through the game and wondering, 'If I just did THAT, what ELSE could there be?!' and that sense of discovery becomes the driving force as you go across the map.   I genuinely love this game and if you are a fan of Golden Axe, Castle Crashers, or have always dreamed of pillaging the good life, look no further than Viking Squad.",
