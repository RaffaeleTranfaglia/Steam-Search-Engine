    "description": "The Flower Shop is a dating and farming simulation game. Steve's life has just taken a downward turn. His grades from his first semester in college are dismal, his relationship with his girlfriend is rocky at best, and now his dad is shipping him off to some farm for the summer so that he can &quot;build character.",

            "review_text": "Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook feels like an early effort by the developer. The central charater is a boy named Steve who is shipped off to his uncle's farm by his father for making all D's in school and for being a selfish child with no ambitions and an attitude problem.   On the farm, Steve protests royally against having to do actual labor, but in order to try to have good relationships, you have to choose options that seem contrary to Steve's nature which takes some of the believability out of the situation. Steve is a jerk, but in order to make progress in the story, you need to not let Steve be a jerk.   The uncle seems to be an important character, but then he vanishes for 75% of the game. The girls Steve meets are all ends of what-the-hell. There is another boy named Jacob who is innocently attracted to one of the girls in the game, and you can watch his anxiety and care for her in every frame get ignored.   The farming mechanic is absolutely pointless. You can earn currency which is spent on more seeds to get more currency to do absolutely nothing more than buy more seeds. By the end of the game, I had saved more than $1000 and thought something neat would happen. Nope. No option to buy anything. No acknowledgement of my small fortune. You can earn lots of money FOR NO REASON, and this infuriated me.   So the game ends, and the one girl you were after never ended up liking you enough, and you don't really know what you could have done, but Gee Whiz, play through it all again and try harder, sport.",

            "review_text": "4 love interests, 9 endings, steam achievements and trading cards!  I enjoyed and highly recommend this Visual Novel and its little farming twist.   The plot revolves around Steve, a guy who’s barely getting by at college with a D average, just got dumped, and has an appalling relationship with his father. His father sends Steve to live with his uncle for a “Summer in Fairbrook” as punishment for his low grades, where Steve is destined to become a farmhand. This trip changes him. His character developing based upon choices you make.   The best aspect of this game is its character development. For instance, Steve’s character changes dependent upon whom you decide Steve should romance in Fairbrook. Other characters also change as events occur within the story.  It takes a little while to work through all the endings, and also very enjoyable to do so, as you learn more about each of Steve’s love interests. Definitely recommend for people who enjoy VNs and dating sims. ",

            "review_text": "What you see is what you get with this game. And what you see is a constricting disappointment. Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook is a shallow, uninspired dating sim with a tacked on and unless farming simulator.  Steve is a dull, flat character with no chance to really gain any interesting traits. No matter what you do during your week, Steve stays the same. No new dialogue choices open up, no new events (You can go through each and ever event present in one play through, except for the ending events.)  Each of the romancable options are two-dimensional and boring. You have the standard affair of the tomboy, the delicate, the bookworm, and this games interpretation of friend from your old life. None of these characters stand out on their own or branch out from their preassigned and obvious roles. This game can't even do something interesting with the 4 simple, tried and true roles it uses.   The minigame of farming, which you would assume would be essential, is useless. The only thing you can do with the money you earn from it is buy more plants. There is nothing else that the money can be used for. And while the farming will inform your ending, it has no real measurable effect throughout the game. As the ONLY thing to do outside of simple interactions with the girls, you would hope it would be more interesting or even fun.  For diehard dating sim fans, this game offers nothing new, interesting, or even fun. For people jsut getting into the genre, avoid this game, it is representative of the worst in dating sims. This game is too fast to beat and lacks any real meat.  I would only recommend this game to dating sim enthusiasts looking for ANYTHING to play, regardless of quality.",

            "review_text": "Great idea of combination farming/dating sim. This game unfortunately falls horribly short of this idea. The farming has nothing to do with any other part of the game and is completely unneccesary. There's no point to even remotely doing any of the farming.  This requires a detailed guide to navigate the relationships at all. I failed the first playthrough. Why? Because I answered that I liked mystery books instead of poetry. There's no versatility in the answers (even if you're given 4 options)-- There is only ONE right answer. Anything else will screw you over.  Second playthrough the wrong girl fell in love with the main character.   I bought this game during Steam Summer Sale and still regret paying for it at all. There's not enough to this game for it to cost anything.",

However for those who have technical difficulties maybe developer should have spyware to have one those issues. Can't spoil what happens to story, however I kind wish they continued it kind ended short. Summer is like 3 months of bliss or sweltering heat to others, Or a pain in ♥♥♥. To me there too much drama to deal with there is lot hinting.  Muisic is good Characters good story play I kind wish it was it made sense for the other story, is there fall episode we don't know?",

The characters I enjoyed, but I wish they had more depth. If you are a beginner to the visual novel world? This a great one to start with. Although the pricing is a little high for what you get, quality wise? I still recommend it. The artwork has a charm to it.  So do the characters, despite the unsatisfying feeling of wanting to delve deeper into their personalities.  I enjoyed this game and getting all of the achievements, but going back and redoing all of that was EXTREMELY tedious. So I would just recommend going for the happy endings. You would generally get somewhere through 1-8 hours of playtime on this game, depending on how meticulously you play through it. I'd rate it a 6/10. Not perfect, but still a good time!",
