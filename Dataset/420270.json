            "review_text": "Into the Void is yet another clone entered into the gaming world. While it has Great Idea for how the game should be it sadly falls far short. Your fleet from what I have played is 6 ships of your choice (when classes unlocked and buildable) from battlecruisers to your typical Super Capitals these types of games have.   The Combat gets stale quickly as the same visuals are seen in near all the fights. Any Intense fighting it advertised I did not encounter in its Turn Based Combat. Issue Order to each ship individually as its turn arrives, choose which guns to fire, at which ships, click end, wait for next ships turn. Each animation has the ships turn the guns at each other.... Each and Everytime and then they open fire. After your 10th time broadsiding the enemy (all you do is Broadside) you would think the crew would keep the guns trained instead of aligning them back across your Bow. But, nope, Each shot... Guns turn towards the ship you have been engaged with for over 8 minutes... fire its volley, and recenters itself forward. Maintain Targetting solution does not exist in this game.   While you can Colonize planets and take over bases, that is about as far as it goes. When you have Resources Click the upgrade on the Structure you put on the planet for mining, harvesting antimatter, farming, or Entertainment centers. Each of these assists in its obvious areas. You get One Structure Per Planet. Your Resources gather each day, click and forget. No setting up supply chains, gaurding transports that might get under attack, nothing further to manage. They might come under attack havent had it happen yet.   Research and Manufacturing are Instant if you collected enough points. These are gathered from Raiding enemy fleets, bases, or probing planets. Once you have enough points, you click what you wanted and you have it. The same goes for building any ship, If you have the points Its Insta built.   Fitting the ships is done in a few clicks. Drag whatever weapons onto the matching Colored box and you have it equipped, upgrade it if you can fit it. Each module has mass and power outputs. Get to heavy and respond slower in turns, Have to little power and you cant fire. Modules of course Exist to boosts anything from Damage to power generation. Larger classes can use fleet boosting modules.   Your missions are a few multi choice questions, then go and enter combat somewhere. Use Autocombat (which cant kill anything quickly) or manually select your choices as mentioned before. After you complete the final missions you automatically return to base. You can return to base at anypoint you want, Even when low on fuel, your magically refilled and made the multiple refuelling trip back in a single click.   This game could become something if it made the combat more exciting, expanded on planet management or even let you run multiple fleets. Some others have mentioned this game was a Mobile game and it would fit in well with those style of dumbed down content that exist on the mobile platform. But when you can get other games like this for cheaper or equal pricing that offer better, its hard to suggest to anyone to purchase this.",

            "review_text": "Absolutly broken. I am getting really tired of steam putting Beta release games in as production copy. This is Beta, nothing wrong with that unless your sold a product that has no business being on the market. Idea is nice, mechanics are boring and cumbersome. All that could be improved but the game has to work and this doesn't. Continue does not continue from where you left off, autosave does not revert you to last autosave (not even star date is correct). Every save outside of base on explore mode fails and leaves you with a ruined game. Auto mode hangs and forces you to restart which won't work becausse of the above. DO NOT buy this game if you are expecting production ready copy.",

            "review_text": "Nice game, especially when you know that this game was made for mobile phones. Graphic is very good, nice too see that devs paid attention to it, since its a huge part of this kind of games. The game seems complicated at first glance, but tips leads you in right direction and in 5 mins of gameplay you know what and how to control everything. The only minus I saw is battle system in auto mode: camera changes viewpoint too fast, I don't always understand where are my ships and where are enemies. Overall I totally recommend this game, good too see when these kind of games come from indie developer.",
