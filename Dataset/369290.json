Airport Madness is very close to KA's gameplay. Easy to pickup, good pace, voice/sound effects are there, and things can get very hectic. Happy I got this one.",

            "review_text": "This is the first time I've actually bought an Airport Madness game, however, I did play the demo of Airport Madness 4 online a lot. It was odd that this version took out the ability to set the traffic level from 1(lowest) to 10(holy crap! Mid-air traffic jams). The only way to set the traffic is in endless mode and even then you only have 3 options. I'd really like to see an update where there is a custom game setting. A option where you pick an airport, set how many planes you want to sucsessfuly land, set the traffic volume and set how many crashes you're allowed before a game over. That's what was missing in this game. I also would not mind if the maps were a little bit larger because it does get a tad crowded, I know that's the point, however, I'd really like more room for delaying flights. So, would I buy this game again? Well, I thought it over and then notived I'd already played it for 85 minutes in one sitting. After realizing that, yes I would buy it again. It's fun and fast paced. The feel and look of the game is great. It goes for the kind of style that is the most fun to the player rather than a realistic radar using controller. I like that because the game would be dull if it was realistic. It's a great little game, but, it is a bit pricey. I waited for the game to be 25% off and that made it worth my money (or lack there-of). I wont give the game a numerical rating since I don't think I could properly explain it. However, I would buy it again even as it is right now. But, I really home Bigfatsimulations considers my ideas.",

E.g. you do not have the option to give the order 'go around', on the Vancouver map the following rwy setup is active and cannot be changed: 13,31,26L,26R - 13 is pretty much exactly opposite of every other active, no ATC in their right mind would have that configuration.  I have defenitly seen better.  Therefore I cannot recommend this game - if you actually wish to play a decent one give Tower! 2011 a try (this is however not available on Steam).",

It's not the graphics, it's not the 'realistic gameplay' it is just the fun it makes and the challanges you will clear, if you once started! Well, I would not recommend this game for everyone, but if you like casual games, which ask fast reaction to different situations and like planes/ATC: BUY IT!!!  I will buy also the 3D-Version which will come in 2016 ... hopefully we will get another ATC3-likely-game! =)",
