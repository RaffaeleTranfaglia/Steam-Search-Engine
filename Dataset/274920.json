I can also edit or make new background, add props, like a Santa hat, viking helmet and maybe a cute kitty samurai helmet if you are lucky. I could go on how great it is to use and experiment with Facerig. Though, I think they should just put feline avatars in it and rename it Mewrig. I love Mewrig.....errr....I mean FaceRig!!!",

I've only found one thing I'd like to see improved in the final version, and that is the ability to recognize and ignore reflections from the user's glasses, if they wear them. I understand that using only a 2-dimensional image of a person's face to process a 3-dimensional rendering of the avatar restricts the software's ability to recognize certain features of the user's face. My problem is, I wear glasses, and the software has trouble recognizing my eyes with them on. Either the avatar's eyes are always closed, or it blinks rapidly and looks like it is having some kind of seizure. I can disable blinking and stuff from the menu, sure, but I don't want to have to do that. Though my glasses have a coating that reduces the amount of glare from reflections, they reflect my monitor just enough to cause problems. And I am blind as a bat without them.  Facerig also doesn't seem to 'turn off' or 'release' the camera after I quit the application. In other words, the camera stays on but nothing is using it.  On another note, I am delighted in the number of 'animal' avatars available. That's really cool!",

            "review_text": "It's less like looking into a mirror than it is like watching a monkey trying to mimic your expressions, but FaceRig has significantly improved in its functionality since its official release in July. Many of these models are fantastic in their capacity to display highly-expressive emotion properly and on time, such as Zyraxes (R), which appears to look stoned half the time when I use him. In addition, they're collaborating with the developers of games I appreciate (such as Starbound; I wouldn't have purchased FaceRig if I didn't instantly fall in love with the Floran model), and revolutionary experimental software (Live2D), the former of which is offered for free.  FaceRig has given me a significant amount of enjoyment through Skype shenanigans, among other things, and was well worth the $15 price. I'm not sure I can recommend it for business use, given that it's still highly unrefined, however, with the sheer number of currently available avatars, the potential for more to be released through the Steam Workshop and for free, and the quality improvements of existing avatars FaceRig has implemented since its appearance on Steam, it continues to explode with potential. Currently the best publicly available facial-recognition software, FaceRig is worth buying just to see Zyraxes twirling a highly-suggestive alien antennae attached to his tongue as he reacts with you to the display.  PS: I do hope they avoid rigging real people. Their Pewdieverse DLC was a horrible idea, and although that may have been mostly due to the average Steam user's 'slightly' negative impression of PewDiePie, I feel the concept itself is bad. FaceRig seems to model its best characters after works of fiction and fantasy (such as TF2), and I would hate to see it begin adding celebrities such as Brad Pitt. If that were the case, it would be targetting a very specific audience not commonly found on Steam... God forbid they add other youtubers. Thanks for reading!",

For the face to really be very accurate and not have occasional issues mapping your mouth or not making weird eye twitches you're going to need proper lighting on your face, a good position and quality of webcam, and potentially a lot of tweaking the settings.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who thinks they're going to use this for something professional, but if you just want to play around with it or you're trying to ERP or whatever it is people do with this software, yeah, it's fun.

And then she was greeted by Fluffo - and melted :) You can surprise anyone with this - and have some laughs.  There are a few area's of improvement, logical since it's beta, it will be interesting to see how these are adressed: - props need manual adjustment before they are correctly in place - not everyone is familiar with 3D coordinates.  (the viking helmet looks great on Fluffo though :) ) - glasses interfere with the detection of the eyes. (Ofcourse this is a challenge to all face-tracking software)  - I had to use Morphvox pro to change the voice to something fitting for Fluffo.  - shoulder activity can not be turned on. In stead, when clicking on the corresponding checkbox, the dialog jumped a number of pixels down. Let's hope that gets fixed soon.  But all in all, this piece of software may well become a very big hit - and rightfully so. Kudo's to the inventors.",

As it's still in beta stage while I write this, it is a bit buggy and missing a few small features - but even still, it's better than I could have hoped. Practically the moment I first launched it, it picked up on me through my laptop's crappy built-in HD camera that only runs at about 5 FPS. Over the next few hours, I messed with my limited hardware settings as I could, and then started experimenting some more with the program, and I'd say it's actually working very well now.  While the UI is a bit cumbersome at the moment, it certainly doesn't stop you from doing as intended. All I had to do was restart Skype and hit the broadcast button in FaceRig and I was able to start using Fluffo to his fullest potential. There's a small selection of avatars to start with, and a few of those offer props as well -  I've already had a bit of a time with that.  For something that's still nowhere near finished, I can safely say I'm as satisfied with it as I would be with a final product! The learning curve is smooth, and you get near-instant gratification upon launching the app. I can only imagine what's to come when things really get underway for this project.  P.S. I only backed with the minimum $5 during the Indiegogo campaign, and I'd gladly pay $20 for the product in its current stage. It's that good.",

You can use it for adverts as long as your head fits in the 4:9 aspect ratio on your camera :D  It also comes with a load of free avatars which also work seemlessly apart from the Pewdiepie on as when you 'Dress Him Up' the costumes do not move with the character for me. (Not sure if it is just me who has that bug.  It also works with Skype in the video sharer and you can chat to your friends as a cheeseburger. ( It is fun :P Try it :D )  So yeah.. Worth the money and a must buy for anyone who creates some sort of content, be if fun or serious!  9/10 :P",

Do note, however, that having a decent microphone and video card is important. the video card because this does do quite a bit of fancy-pantsrendering. The microphone because lipsync is largely based on the sound that goes through it.  If you have a complete **** built-in microphone like I do, you can turn up the sensitivity settings in the software, but my reccommendation is that you just get a better mic.  A microphone is not required for mouth movements to work, however, without it, the software will only reproduce broad mouth shapes, and less of the finer ones.  Also, be aware that there IS a watermark on the video, even if you've bought it. A bit of a nuisance, but, hopefully, it will be removed/ made less annoying in future.  I give this a 10/10, for beta software. Lots of fun, though not really practical. Definitely well-built, with some next-gen technology here. I can't wait to make my own models for it.",

One thing I can recommend to potential buyers is that you do not try to use it with a cheap camera/eye. As far as I can tell, not actually being a programmer, the program needs an accurate, not hazy, image and keep those quality camera images flowing at, at least, the specified frame rate to reach its proper capacity of accuracy and ability to keep up as shown in the promotional video. I say this because I tried it with a cheap $5-ish dollar camera/eye and had poor results from it, but I do not think it was necessarily the program's fault.  Long story short, you definitely need a quality camera/eye to use FaceRig right. ",

Even a phone LED light helps.  It makes Skype hilarious, and its well worth the $14.99. The anthropomorphic characters seem to work the best.  If your camera isn't working (black screen), try: within FaceRig going into the Advanced UI --&gt; general options -&gt; devices -&gt; there in that list re-select the right webcam, even if it is already selected, and then press refresh.  Overall, I'd give it a 8.9/10. being able to use it over skype makes it even better, and its cool to be able to transform into an anthro wolf, tiger, doge, TF2 character, or one of the other dozens of characters with customization.",

The face doesn't match my actual expressions very well and only a limited range of expressions are possible. I can smile, I can kind of squint my eyes (but sometimes the eyes act weird). I can shake my head no, but if I nod yes, it confuses it into thinking I'm closing my eyes because it can't even figure out that face getting shorter = angle changing. Somewhat understandably, it doesn't track my hands, but that's a huge handicap when I talk with my hands (I'm part Italian, it seems to be in my blood). Really, the advantage of seeing my face or an avatar is that you can see my expressions. If I can't make half the expressions I want to or even make gestures with my hands, then it's no better than a phone call with no visual representation.  I used this with MorphVox to modify my voice and the effect was kinda nice. It would be cool if this app had better voice changing abilities to actually match the characters, although fixing the flaws in the facial expression tracking is a much higher priority.  Also, the fact that this is Windows-only is a huge bummer. I would prefer Linux and Mac as well as the main thing I'd like to use this with is Skype, which is already cross-platform and I'm not on Windows most of the time. Having this on iOS and Android would also be a plus if I'm still somehow able to use this with Skype (might not be possible though).

The programmers have a launcher inside their program that basically serves no purpose other than to try and get you to buy their halloween avatars or whatever, which is irritating and bad form for paid software. To make matters worse, the launcher they use is prone to hangs and the developers left it in knowing full well that once launched, it freezes systems. (I can tell they intentionally left it in because they have a launch option choice to TRY and bypass it; but if you forget to select the bypass option, have fun with your computer restart, because thats the only way its closing!)  My jimmies are far too rustled to do anything but give a bad review to a product that intentionally has broken, system destabilizing content left in it with what are essentially advertisement banners shoved into a PAID product.",
