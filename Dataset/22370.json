            "review_text": "  Fallout 3 – Game of the Year Edition   is a first-person open world post-apocalyptic RPG. After escaping from Vault 101, a subterranean nuclear fallout shelter you lived in all your life, you explore the post-nuclear war-torn wastelands of Washington DC while on the trace of your father's footsteps.   Pros:  1st person perspective is a huge departure from the original   Fallout   games that add to the immersiveness. The game offers a very large world to explore, filled with bandits, super mutants, ghouls and radioactive creatures. I love the bottle caps as currency, although you're likely to mostly barter for ammos and equipment in exchange for the incredible amount of scraps and junk you can scavenge. There's a nice amount of guns to get your hands on, drugs (or chems) to give you boosts, and an assortment of food and medicine to keep your health up, most of which is irradiated which forces you to carefully manage your radiation poisoning. Quests are plentiful, and everywhere you go you'll have people asking for help in these hard times. The RPG elements consists of your basic attributes and trained skills, while leveling up allows you to train those skills and assign perk points to an increasing list of perk options, so that you may make your character just the way you want it. The VATS system allows you do precision targeting in fights, with VATS points just limited enough to avoid over use.   Cons:  The world design is not on par with modern post-apocalyptic setting: wastelands feel barren and empty, buildings look and feel repetitive, and the urban DC area is nothing but impassable walls of concrete rubble with only the occasional building you can actually get in. Graphics and character designs feel repetitive and didn't age well. Gameplay does include a third-person option, but it's basically the same as the first-person option except that you see your character's back. Getting started can discourage newcomers as the early game is much harder and players spend most of their time going back and forth carrying junk with their limited carrying capacity to barter for barely as much ammos as they spent getting their loot, assuming the few vendors even have any stock of ammos compatible with the guns you have.   Verdict:  ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you  I'm threading lightly as not everyone will enjoy this game: it's not as lively as   Fallout 4  , not as deep as the   Metro   series, and doesn't have the personality of the   Borderland   series. If you're a classic Fallout fan looking for a modern take on the isometric cRPG style, you should probably be looking at   Wasteland 2  . Otherwise, this game and its DLCs will give you dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay, so of course I recommend it!    P.S. : Those experiencing compatibility issues can fix this through the use of Mods. Unfortunately, these are not supported by Steam and installing an external 3rd party Mod manager will prevent this game from running normally through Steam. If   Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords   can have Steam Workshop support added a decade after release, I see no reason or excuse for   Bethesda   not to do the same with their original take on the  Fallout  franchise.  —————————————————————————   This was just my opinion.   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)  reviews . ",

            "review_text": "Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas?  I see a lot of people asking about if they should play Fallout 3 first, or Fallout: New Vegas. I went through this dillemma myself. I chose to buy Fallout: New Vegas.  Let me first give you a brief summary about the two games: Fallout 3: You are a vault dweller. Your father has left the vault for an unknown reason. You go after him and enter the Capital Wasteland. You're main goal is to find your father again. Fallout: New Vegas: You are a courier who had to deliver a package, but in the middle of your journey you were shot in the head by a member of the Chairmen (one of the families of the Strip). You wake up after being healed by an old man and you track him down. There is also a war going on in the Mojave Wasteland between the NCR, the New California Republic which is a faction that works with laws and such as they did before the bombs fell, and Caesers Legion, a faction based upon the old Romian Empire which is build upon slaves.  There are two major differences in the two games. Fallout 3 is build upon the idea that you are fresh out of the vault. In the game, everything is new to you ánd your character. Fallout: New Vegas is not really build upon this idea. You were shot in the head and you start your journey from a little farmers town.  Fallout 3 has an interesting storyline which I really enjoyed. It feels more personal then in New Vegas. Fallout: New Vegas has a lot (and I mean a lot) of choices. The game is bigger than Fallout 3, because it has more quests.  I chose New Vegas because I wanted to have a lot of things to do in the game. But I now regret this decission. I think you should buy Fallout 3 first, it's a great beginning for Fallout games in general if you have never played one. You get all the basics early on in the game and your goal is pretty clear. If you already played Fallout 4, then I'd recommend you to buy Fallout: New Vegas.",

This is a pretty good and immersive game where you get to wander around the ruins of the 1940s version an ancient city called 'Washington D.C.' after total atomic annihilation in order find your missing dad who is played by Liam Neeson! Along the way you find some creatively built shanty towns, interesting characters and cool factions. You can choose to make the Capital Wasteland a better or significantly worse place depending on the way you chose to tackle quests given to you by the many locals you meet. This is a must buy on sale.   Tunnel Snakes rule!!!",

            "review_text": "Great game, great characters. However there are a few flaws.  The first one is it's legendary instability under Windows 7 or later. Depending on your setup, the game can be anywhere between unplayable and crashing at the title screen to playable, but with scrambled music due to the Directsound kerfuffle. Heck, even though the game is playable under Vista the soundtrack is scrambled albeit still fixable if you're willing to go out and buy a Creative gaming sound card if just to use ALchemy to fix the soundtrack. The biggest issue is that Bethesda is not willing to fix the bugs even though there is a huge fanbase, and is even working against the fans by issuing takedowns at unofficial patches to fix the issues. That's right, the developer doesn't want fans to play the game with proper music.   Secondly, the game uses the problematic Games for Windows Live framework for a lot of things, including copy protection. Microsoft recently announced that they're shutting down GFWL. Guess what this means for the game. Sure, again there are fanmade patches to work around this, but well, it shows Bethesda's mindset.  In short, unless you're willing to go the full mile securing a decent Windows XP machine and then get your hands dirty with unofficial patches, don't buy this. If you absolutely must, get one of the console versions instead, PC gaming master race be damned. Don't get me wrong- It's a great game, and I support both consoles and PCs equally, but the PC version of this game is just not worth it and I'm not happy with the way Bethesda is treating the PC players of this game.  EDIT: Just bought a new laptop and upgraded it to Windows 10. Won't run, period. The game installs, the Launcher comes up (along with a stern warning from Windows saying that this game won't run), and... nothing. Clicking on Play results in nothing happening. Additionally, the game's installation of Games for Windows Live bricked the laptop's internet connection until said item is uninstalled. It has went from bad to worse. I definitey don't recommend it now. It's a great game, but it's coding is so bad it's not even forwards compatible with newer versions of Windows.",

Which brings me to my first 'Pro'    Pros:   - A HUGE amount of content , it is insane how much there is to do in Fallout 3. The map is big, there are a lot of places to discover, people to talk to, quests to do, items to find, computers to hack, locks to pick and enemies to shoot. A vast assortment of mods add a lot to this already amazing game!  - The story is good , its nothing special but it is good enough, the DLC's are also amazing and have their own stories!  - DLC done right , this isn't some cash grab DLC game, the DLC's add new items, enemies, lore and more to the game!  - Great atmosphere , the music is really good too!  - Your choices matter , the dialogue system is great, although the characters you talk to are a bit 'lifeless'.    Cons:   - Stiff NPC's/unrealistic animations , When you talk to someone they stand still like they are a tree, the animations aren't very good either.  - Graphics are very outdated , this isn't a con to me personnaly but it might throw some people off, ofcourse there are mods to make it look better!  - Bugs and glitches , sometimes funny, sometimes game breaking.

Rather than discuss why I recommend this game, allow me to post a slight side quest spoiler, as it really captures the moment where I fell in love with Fallout 3.  As I was exploring the wastes, I came across a sizeable tower. As I neared this tower, I saw a Ghoul (ie looks like a Zombie but is in full control of his body/mind) aruging with someone over an intercom. Naturally I eavesdropped and discoverd the Ghoul wanted to bring his people into the tower, and the people in the tower, very clearly did not want them in.   So as the dismissed Ghoul left I naturally tried my hand at getting into the tower. As I was a human, they let me in no problem. Its there that I picked up a quest to eliminate the Ghouls, as they were become increasingly bothersome to the residents. So I ventured into the tunnels, and found the leader whom I saw previously yelling into the towers intercom. He proposed a different solution, one that would let him and his band of ghouls forcefully take over the tower.   I weighed my options. Most tower citizens were not bigots, so I saw no reason to kill them to let the Ghouls in, yet I did not want to elimite the Ghouls. Not agreeing with eliminating either party, I opted for a more peaceful route.  After a few speech persuasions, (maybe a few stealthy murders) I persuaded the majority of the citizens in the tower to let the Ghouls in. The ghouls moved in shortly after. All was well. I had done it. I had solved a problem, with both parties intact.  or so I thought.  I returned to check up on my Ghoul/tower residents, and I noticed something amiss. The former tower leader, was gone, and so were a few of the other human residents. Some investigating later, I found the bodies of a few of the previous Human occupants, shoved in a storage closet. I questioned the Ghoul leader, and he dismissed the murders as 'accidents' related to 'disagreements'.   I lost it. I slayed every single Ghoul in that tower, I felt betrayed. Had I not done the good thing? I made two groups coexist. In my quest for an ideal solution I did not see the underlying problem.   And now my charecter sits in an empty tower. Filled with neither Ghouls nor Humans, contemplating the error of my choice, dwelling on my unsastisfying rampage against the ghouls that betrayed me. All the while marvelling at the game design, and how it made clear moral choices murky.",

Perhaps i am doing a more informative review one day. :D  9/10",

            "review_text": "Out of any company that could've gotten the rights to the Fallout franchise it had to be Bethesda, the company notorious for dumbing down the Scrolls series, Fallout was once an intricate RPG that focused on character progression, decision making that actually had an impact on the world around you, deep interaction with NPC's and using tactics to overcome tough disadvantages.  Fallout 3 is nothing more than an action game in an open world, with barely any RPG elements at all besides for upgrading your players stats everytime you level up, which have no consequence as to how your game plays out seeing as it's so damn easy in any case, as you basically role play as Superman which allows you to put little regard in thought when it comes to building your character.  The decision making, which is an extremely massive part in every true RPG's soul, has been narrowed down to 'Good guy/Bad guy' decisions rather than offering you multiple options, each which have a consequential impact minor or big that make you feel more involved with the world. The plot, another important aspect of RPG, is as generic and un-inspired as they come, a 12 year old could've written this.  In Fallout 3 there is NEVER any sense of danger, ever, you can traverse from one end of the map to the other with ease, unlike the older games in which travelling was a major risk and each encounter felt like it could be your last. I really hope they're using a better team for Fallout 4 because if it's anything like this dumbed down generic open world FPS it's going to stink, if you really want to play a modern Fallout, I'd suggest you play New Vegas, they attempt to fix most of the issues in this mess otherwise you're better off playing Fallout 1 and 2.",

The feeling of being in a destroyed neo-50's american world has a great affect on gameplay; to be surrounded by a futuristic twist on what was probably the peak of American culture while listening to tracks of American Swing and Jazz Blues while beating a Deathclaw to death after it surprise-attacked you and made you soil your pants is an experience that will only be found in the Fallout games.  The story of Fallout 3 is very reminiscent of the plots behind Fallout 1 and 2, and whilst i would say that i'd rather see a completely different story to the original games, there is far more story and content to make up for the main storyline which in my opinion wasn't anything new.  This game has allowed me to understand and enjoy an old genre of music that is found constantly played through the Galaxy News Radio station. I can't begin to tell you how many times i've listen to Bob Crosby and Cole Porter.  What this game does best and what i find Bethesda Game Studios to do best at in all their games is atmosphere and the feeling of being in the world that they are trying to portray. They did an extremely good job of capturing that post-Apocalyptic feel that aligns well with the classic games, but there are subtle differences because of the location and the different developers.  Combat is very fun, but not as responsive as some of the best shooters out there, but i'll give Bethesda credit as they are known for fantasy games where there is no such thing as fast fire-rate guns, since this is there first time at making an open world shooter RPG they did a good job at least. VATS is definitely the best part about combat, and the gore is super funny. The reaction i'd make to a super mutant's head exploding after a 32. caliber round through the skull is again one of the perks of playing this game.  There is a split of opinion between the new fans and the classic fans. My first Fallout experience was Fallout 3 but eventually i bought the older games and aced both of them, and i think all of them are great. I love this franchise and always will. I definitely recommend this game if you're new to the franchise, and then move onto New Vegas and then the classics.  Overall, i rate this game a 9.5/10. There is so much to do in this game, from taking in the lore, to the happy-go music, the rich culture and the endless gory fun, you will not go wrong by spending your money on this game.",

'Fallout 3' is one of those games, that I can recommend without any doubts. I know that there are fans of Fallout 1&amp;2 out there, who do not like the changes within game mechanics, but I would say that it's perfectly normal - when something that we really enjoy change a lot, we usually react badly. I did not play any previous 'Fallout', so I judge this as a standalone game. And what a great game it is.   Pros: + music  + open world with tons of locations, secrets, references, memorable characters and pretty much everything else that you would like to see in the game like this + plot - some people say that it's the worse part of the game, but for me plot was good enough + player's stats that can unlock new dialogue options (not only charisma, but strength or perception), that actually make a difference (for example allows us to avoid fight) + perks are awesome. You can use your experience points to raise one of your stats or just add new skills (not only combat related. You can unlock perk that increase the gore effect, allows you to easily influence other gender or children, add new dialogue options and that's only the beginning) + pretty good morality system, that influence the way that some characters in the game treat us (and if potential companions will be interested in joining forces with us) + there are always at least two ways to solve each quest (and quite often more) + humor - dark and grotesque, it fits this game very well + moddable (it's easy and there are quite a lot 'Fallout 3' mods out there) + lore, atmosphere and atmosphere once again. Choosing your hair, mustache, perks, quests, dialogues, creatures - everything fit perfectly into the Fallout world.  Cons: - DLC are not interesting at all. Beside possibility of gaining 30 level, there's not much to them. You can't bring your companions on extra adventures. What is worse, they can be very challenging and sometimes you don't have a chance to properly prepare yourself. Some people may find them enjoyable, for me they were annoying and definitely too long. - no sprint option - map can be very disorienting - if you're playing for the first time and don't really know what you're doing, you may get easily frustrated, trying to follow map markers and ending up nowhere - there's not to much difference to buildings or rooms layouts. It's pretty easy to get lost in bigger locations.",

This game took the semi-popular fallout franchise and revolutionised it in a way that must have seemed genius at the time although now we find ideas like that common-place by making Third/First person.  For anyone who is new to the fallout universe, or just want a tad of backstory, here it is: Fallout 3 is based in the ruins of Washington DC which was destroyed in a war between America and China that ended with most of America turned into a nuclear wasteland. You have grown up in one of the many Vaults built by the government for what was thought to be protection against the war, but they where really built as a social experiment, with each vault being subjected to different experiments, from white noise to genetic mutations to never being allowed to open, all of which the inhabitants of these Vaults were unnaware of when they moved in.  Now to the game its self. Fallout has pulled of the wasteland feel so well, from the survival to the ruins to all the strange and just down right wrong enemys you'll face. It has a great soundtrack based around the 50s-60s era which adds a strangely happy tone to the mood. The graphics are nothing special, but take into consideration how old it is. The weapons system just adds to the wasteland feel, with having to find ammo in the wasteland, and having to fix your weapons if the get to worn out. The most iconic part of this game is the armour, i mean just look at the game art, already you see a set of impressive armour, which just makes people to want it more.  Alright lets wrap this up. Overall this game was groundbreaking when it came out, and to this day its still fun to return to the great DC ruins once more for another adventure, and isn't that what makes a game great? the ability to replay the game with the same enthusiasm as if you where playing it for your first time again. This game has shown me the greatest part of a nuclear Apocolypse, and that is... Adventure.  9.5/10  -=LevitatingBacon=-",

Gunplay is great, addictive, and will keep you going till the end. Side quests are located all around the map, some marked, others not, hundreds of hours of gameplay. Ever since day one, I loved the karma system, this idea of being good, evil, or somewhere in between always intruiged me and because of that I have had many playthroughs of the game. Doing a good run, then getting curious and doing all the evil, devious things, then started a neutral playthrough, then doing another good run, because I forgot all the quests, rewards, and the overall atmospheric changes you can have on the wastes. Which, I also loved, because you can actually make a difference in this wasteland. If you get bored with the playthroughs, there's also a thriving modding community out there with plenty of awesome mods to check out.   You know, some say New Vegas is an overall better game, with its factions, added gameplay, better mechanics, but there is one thing Fallout 3 will always have over New Vegas: That Dark Wasteland Post Apocalyptic feel, something New Vegas didn't really show.  10/10",

The depth in quests and even unmarked quests, the interactions with other wastelanders or sometimes even just interactions with the ruins of Post-apocalyptic D.C. completely outshines the main story. FO:3 is so good because the emphasis of the game isn’t on some planned-tourist-guide of the wasteland instead it’s on what  you  want to do – whatever you want to do. ",

Now before I start I'll end the common debate most people have when they want to start playing the Fallout series... DO I PURCHASE FALLOUT NEW VEGAS OR FALLOUT 3? Well since I have both I'll write down the pros and the cons of both games so bear with me for now. Fallout 3 Pros + Very story rich, tells you about the Lone Wanderer and how he/she was born and raised. + Is a very beautiful game in my personal opinion. + Very nice radio that will keep you entertained while travelling the Washington wasteland. + Multiple endings so you can keep playing this game over and over. + THREE DOG AND DOGMEAT. + Very big atmosphere that's entirely yours to explore. + VATS is a wonderful gameplay mechanic that is introduced in Fallout 3. + Karma meter which makes you feel like you're an actual person instead of just a mindless killer. Fallout 3 Cons - No iron sight aiming. - Not optimized for Windows 7 or later. (This doesn't mean that it's unplayable on Windows 7 it's just that you have to modify the game files and that's really time consuming. Took me about 7 hours to fix Fallout 3 for my Windows 7 computer.) - Somewhat small level cap (20, but can be increased with the Broken-Steel DLC) - Very short main story line. - Companions AREN'T invincible. - Doesn't have an indicatior for when weapons are really worn thus making them more likely to jam. Now that I've talked a bit about Fallout 3 I'll talk about the pros and cons of Fallout: New Vegas Fallout: New Vegas Pros + Iron sight aiming. + VATS is a returning feature in Fallout: New Vegas. + Companions are invincible. + Hardcore mode is an option for all you hardcore fans out there. + Runs fine on Windows 7 and later (managed to run it on my terrible computer at a stable 60 FPS.) + A better radio than Fallout 3 (in my personal opinion.) + Weapon modification is an option. + REX. + You're in Las Vegas, what more do I need to say? + Some fun gambling to do in The Strip if that's your thing. + Increasing level cap if you have DLC installed. (Increases by 5 for each DLC, 30 is the base level cap.) + Very big and beautiful world, but not as big as Fallout 3. + The Kings. + No karma requirements to recruit companions. + Reputation for factions. Fallout: New Vegas - Tons of invisible walls over the Mojave Wasteland. - No back story AT ALL about our player character: The Courier. - Very limited story endings. - A lot of walking must be done unless you have found some places to fast travel to.  - TONS of bugs. - A.I isn't as good as in Fallout 3. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now for the review of Fallout 3: You start off as a baby that is newly born. You then have a time skip to you as a toddler, and another to when you're 10, and 15. Finally when you're 18 the game really starts. This game is beautiful the moment you step out of Vault 101 and see the sunlight for the first time. It's not too far into the game when you meet Dogmeat, a fan favourite companion loved by all. During this time you are already free to do as you please and explore the Washington wastelands. This game is entirely based by your actions so it's amazing that you get to choose how the game will end. Will you be a villian feared all across the wasteland? Or will you be the guardian angel of the wasteland? If you want to find out... BUY THIS GAME! (Ps. took me about an hour to write, enjoy)",

The DLC easily adds 100's of hours to the game, simply because Broken Steel, allows you to continue after the end of the base game. The sidequests, and backstories, for everything are wonderfully done. And the in-game radio stations are just great, playing all the songs that just complete the atmosphere of the game.

            "review_text": "Fallout 3. This is a game that will, most of the time, suck you in with its amazing atmosphere and environments. I say most of the time because, just like the Steam notice says there, it's not optimized for Windows 7. Now I have Windows 7, and I fully played through all the content in this game, and what I believe they're trying to say with that is that this game has a bunch of performance issues. Fallout 3 loves to crash. A lot. As in, it made me press the quicksave button all the time so I'd make sure I wouldn't lose as much progressas I potentially could. However, I did play through everything, and I loved it. In fact, this is the second time that I've played through everything in Fallout 3. I just love the game so much that even the regular crash couldn't stop me.  The very first part of the game is so well done, very immersive and eases you into the game proper nicely. Don't expect amazing shooting mechanics, while it does have FPS mechanics (you'll never used third person camera because of how bad it is for combat) you don't play it for the shooting. You play it instead for the RPG elements, the storytelling, and the impeccable atmosphere the Wasteland offers you. It's grim, it's gory, it's gritty, it is a complete hellhole on a destroyed post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Many of the landmarks that characterize D.C in the real world are very well replicated here in its ruined and wrecked glory.   The Fallout universe itself is a joy to be in, with its 50's/futuristic quirks, power armors, aliens, big guns that really go BOOM, and freaky mutations. The game did give me quite a few jumpscares when I was caught unawares by some of the wildlife. The V.A.T.S system is awesome as you pick your favorite body part and shoot, complete with guts and gore flying everywhere as your enemies die. Good stuff.  The inevitable question when it comes to this game is: 'Is it better than New Vegas or is it the other way around?' I would say that even though I slightly prefer New Vegas, both are worth playing anyway because it shows both Bethesda and Obsidian's strong (and weak) points. And both are good games in their own right.  Bethesda made Fallout 3. And what makes Bethesda great are both its sidequests (which are always more interesting than the main story itself) and its attention to detail in its environments. They love to litter the landscape with information, each containing a small story or information explaining why that skeleton's standing in that bathroom, for example. And sometimes it doesn't, all it shows you, all it needs, is the scenery itself that tells the story for you. This makes exploration really engaging and fun because things rarely feel they're copypasted (except the subway tunnels but there's only so much you can do to make a ruined subway tunnel stand out, though some do stand out anyway).  The quests themselves have multiple solutions and most of the time offer choice, like a good RPG should, and trust me, you can do some extreme stuff in these which will literally change the landscape, but then again, these choices and this engaging writing are severely lacking in the main quest itself, which is clichéd and ultimately really linear.   I prefer Obsidian's writing overall, so New Vegas wins out on Fallout 3 for me there. Fallout 3 though, like any good sandbox RPG should do, which New Vegas does not, is allow you to keep playing after the actual ending. In NV's defense though, there are so many endings that it would be hell to program into, but still, it's something worth keeping an eye out for.  Fallout 3's the oldest game of the two, so it will, gameplay-wise, lack a few features NV adds in later on.  Like any modern Bethesda RPG, Fallout 3 adds much needed mod support which makes the PC version by far the best, allowing you to fix many of its faults, and become an even better experience than it already is. Though I'd recommend just sticking to performance mods the first time around, as some of these mods can change the game dramatically.  The DLC for the game itself is a bit hit and miss in my opinion. DLCs like Broken Steel which let you keep playing the game after its conclusion, or Point Lookout and The Pitt, which add areas of their own with stuff to do are great, but Anchorage and Zeta, though unique, don't add to the game all that much, and you wouldn't feel like something's missing if these never came out.  All in all, I totally recommend this game, lots of RPG goodness and with mod support, can have you keep coming for more.",

Whether you enjoyed the first or not, and whether you tried the second as well, then see how long you can last playing this mess of a game.   I'll admit, when I first picked it up, I enjoyed it immeadiately, and binged it for hours. It is quite a bit of fun, if not stupid fun. As you play on, you begin to realize how loosely the story and world of the game is held together. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are cliche as hell, there are strictly two sides (black and white of course) to the story, the weapons are uninspired and bland, and they, to say it in a juvenile fashion, feel like sticks with ♥♥♥♥ on the ends of them. Not to mention the game's enviornment is spotty and dull. That green tint can get ♥♥♥♥ing old quick, and oftentimes, you will have no idea where you are until you take a gander at the map. It's like Bethesdashit just made a basic desert world on a piece of paper, tacked it to the wall, and threw a ♥♥♥♥-ton of darts at it to denote where they would put places, events, towns, and so-on. No rhyme or reason as to where anything is.     This game also suffers from the same problem that a lot of Bethesdacrap games have, such as very poorly made animations, weapons that feel like cardboard sticks or airsoft guns, ugly as sin character models, a strong lack of voice actors to compensate for the vast amount of 'unique' characters in the game, no vareity in clothing, and broke leveling mechanics. Di I say the story makes no sense when you look at the big picture? It's as if a pre-teen fanfic writer smoked some pot and wanted to make a Fallout story.    Despite these shortcomings, I rate the game a 4/10 for having a small amount of replayability, a vision that shines through the cracks of caked-on ♥♥♥♥, and a very nostalgic and memorable soundtrack (not the terrible and generic OST created for the game, I'm talking about anything that plays on Galaxy News Radio, and not Three-dog's annoying vocal-chord vibrations he calls a voice).    Once you trudge through the wasteland, play every DLC (if you didn't max out your character's level by the end of the game) minus Mothership Zeta for something different, and then high-tail your ♥♥♥ to the Mojave in Fallout New Vegas, which in my opnion, is the true Fallout 3. Do NOT skip this game if you intend to jump into New Vegas! If you play this first, you will enjoy it a tad, and it will allow you to enjoy New Vegas a lot more due to the problems it fixes and the soul it has to offer. If you play New Vegas first, you will not enjoy Fallout 3 at all, making both games seem kind of dull and leaving a bad taste in your mouth. Just pray that Bethesdick collaborates with the guys behind New Vegas on the next Fallout.",

Also this is the reason while community is so torn about this game. Fans wanted it to be in line with it's predecessor, Bethesda didn't deliver, only used the IP.  Still love it or hate it, Fallout 3 is a good game - IF you like exploration and loot hoarding. But it's a bad RPG - be it cliche story, odd combat or very streamlined stats behind. It does deliver the Fallout series feeling of the nuclear wasteland with buried civilization wonders. You explore the old Vaults and wonder what happened here?  The DLCs aren't really groundbreaking, more loot, more monsters, more mini quests and locations.   Mods are crucial part of this game, especially now when it aged and cause problem on newer PCs and operating systems. Also they do enchance both combat and too casual mechanics that made game too streamlined and easy. Can't really help with poor and old graphic or with poor role-playing side. Anything else you'll find at nexus mods.  Despite this being a different approach to fallout series I do recoomend it to everyone, especially with all DLCs and various mods that help to customize it to your likings.",

The beginning is very slow-paced, but it gives a nice touch to the whole story. But right after entering Megaton - boy, was I impressed. That was the very moment when I felt the 'Bethesda spirit', because of which I love their games so much. Interesting backstory of the location, quite nice backstories of each character in the 'city', a lot of interesting loot, nice dialogues and the big introduction to the essence of the game - BE GOOD OR BE BAD.  The morality/consequence system in the game is based on extremities - there are just a few moments when you can stay neutral with your decision. Therefore, most time you decide whether you want to be good or bad. However, sometimes your seemingly good/bad choices can result in the opposite of your intention - that is why a player has to THINK while deciding - it pays off and it's really cool.  Due to the common belief that F:NV is a better game than F3, I'd like to contribute a few words to the discussion. As a whole, I consider F:NV to be the better one, but my F3 playthrough was twice longer than any on my F:NV playthroughs. Draw some conclusions. Also, Washington in F3 seems to be much more affected by the atomic explosions than Las Vegas in F:NV. The whole world of F3 seems also to be more miserable and hopeless in contrary to the one of F:NV, which seemingly make it more suitable to the postapocalyptic vision, but I guess it's a matter of taste - personally, I still like more the atmosphere of New Vegas, but I completely understand why some people prefer the one from Fallout 3.   The gameplay is rewarding and satisfying - every kill, succesful attempt of persuasion/lockpick/etc. results in earned exp, which just HAS to make you feel good - and it does. You can have your own home that you can upgrade with some Fallout lore technology, you can capture people to make them slaves, you can hunt slavers, you can help or kill almost any person that has his/her's own personality and habits. Oh, btw - habits. I love the habit system, as it makes the world feel ALIVE, and the immersion is the first thing that I'm looking for in RPG games. NPCs have their break-times, eat breakfast/dinner, sleep and have random conversations between each other. So, if you suffer lack of funds, why not steal from the cash register of some folk? You walk into the shop, but he observes your every move. Solution? Just break into the shop during the night time - he will be sleeping, so as long as you maintain to be silent, you're good to go. AWESOME.  Now, some bad things. Unlike developers wanted me to, I completed all of the available DLCs BEFORE ending the main story. As for the DLCs - they are mediocre at their least. Some of them are even worse. Somehow, I regret my decision to play them instead of discovering the locations from the main map. Most of the DLCs are linear ('Point Lookout' is the only exception) and - let's face it - just boring. Playing them wasn't a very good idea also because of one more reason - with little more than half of the game's locations discovered, I hit the 30lvl cap and the game became a dull chore - the character progression just stopped - no more perks, no more skills. Therefore, I was forced to install a mod which allowed me to raise the level cap. After 62hrs of gameplay, I raised almost all of my skills to 100 and raised all of my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats to 9/10. I know that there are some mods that actually fix this problem, but I wanted to play the game itself, not its modded counterpart. Now, the only thing left is to discover the rest of the locations (20-30, maybe) and to finish the Broken Steel DLC (which is available only after finishing the main questline). Now, I probably need a short break before I complete the game in 100%.  Also, the optimisation! It's... bad. Skyrim runs much more fluently on my laptop, and it's a game that is 3 years younger. And much bigger. And prettier. At the very start, the game was unplayable with its constant freezes and crashes. This solution fixed it for me, both on my desktop PC (i5, GTX 970) and laptop (i7, GT650M SLI):  'Open up the fallout.ini file in: My Documents\\My Games\\Fallout3  Find the line:  bUseThreadedAI=0  change it to:  bUseThreadedAI=1  Add another line after it and insert:  iNumHWThreads=2  This will limit the game to 2 cores and prevent the engine bug from causing the game to freeze.'  Hope that you find it helpful!  With all of its advantages and disadvantages, Fallout 3 is still a great action RPG.  [EDIT]: I've just finished the 'Broken Steel' DLC (same as the rest, linear and mediocre). The main good thing about it is that it's short. I visited couple more locations and lost interest in this title. Still, overall it's a great game that provides many hours of satisfactory and rewarding gameplay.",

Early game is mildly taxing compared to late game, at which point you become an unstoppable force of maxed out in everything as per every single Bethesda game ever. The game is also pretty polarized in regards to said morality, as well. There are no hard choices. The game copies the *VISUAL* sense of desolation from Fallout 1 well, but lacks the black humor in the writing, factions, music, voiceovers, and the quality of interactions between the PC and environment. Fallout 1 was short and sweet. This game is drawn out and full of crap, and not the high quality crap that filled up Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas. I don't regret playing this game for 50+ hours, but I don't exactly celebrate its release as game of the year.",

New Vegas uses a tired cliche about being shot in the head and asks the players to suspend their disbelief by telling them, like many RPGs before them, that they have lost part of their memory. With Fallout 3, there is no need for that suspension of disbelief, you know your history, you remember being born, you remember the big events of your childhood.  Story: Your father leaves under mysterious circumstances and doesn't realize the danger this puts you in so you have to effect your own escape from your vault. Once you are out, are you going to track down the father who just up and left you without a word? Will you realize that he has a way to purify the water for everyone in the D.C area? Will you help him or stand in his way? These are all big questions you have to answer in Fallout 3. In New Vegas you are asked to decide between competing political factions as to who gets control of the Hoover dam.  Locations: Sure, New Vegas has real cities that you can go and visit. You can go find Primm and see the roller coaster, you can find goodsprings and see the saloon, but Fallout 3 has one city built around an unexploded nuke, one city built on an abandoned aircraft carrier, and an underground city populated only by children.  The only place where New Vegas is better is the DLC Dead Money and Old World Blues otherwise, Fallout 3 wins hands down.",

The gritty post apocalyptic wasteland of a landscape is harsh and intimidating, with suprises around every darkened corner. Fused perfectly into the unforgiving state of post nuclear Washington DC is a 50's retro theme that gives this hostile enviroment an uplifting flare that comes off as increadibly eerie in the once thriving ghost town of a city.

It consistently crashes on my computer. It's buggy. But despite all that I'm reccomending the game. Why? Because it's that good. The story's good. The voice acting is a solid 8/10, the environments are lovingly - if drearily - crafted, the combat is well designed and intense, the exploration is genuine, the emotions are deep and the controls are intuitive. If you're on the fence, just get Fallout 3. Or wait until Fallout 4 comes out, then it'll probably be cheaper",

A real keeper and a must have for RPG lovers.",

I won't comment about bugs or anything, only other problems. This game is overrated as ♥♥♥♥. The storyline is unoriginal and flat, the lore is a complete mess ,and it is very tedious. Wanna repair your gun? Oh sorry wait until your repair is level 100 to repair it all the way which even then takes new weapons. The gameplay is basically like a dumbed down version of oblivion. Except this one is very forgiving, the main quest is very short, and the whole karma is stupid. Just nuked a village full of people? You will be forgiven if you do the main storyline the 'good' way. The DLC's are ok, I guess. The only ones worth getting are Mothership and The pitt. For the open world is either a plain landscape or DC, which I guess is ok. This is one of the worst fallout games in the franchise, right above FO:Brotherhood of steel. Wanna real Fallout FPS? Try New Vegas, It isn't black and white, has believable lore, and actually seems like a fallout game that doesn't try to appeal to everyone.",

If you want a good Fallout game, play Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 1, and Fallout 2. You should probably pirate those games to avoid Burchthesda gaining more money. I'll be fair though. Here are the Pro's and Con's of this game.  PROS:  - Switching from Isometric turn based mechanics to FPS style mechanics. This creates a more interactive world, where you can see things up close and feel very immersed, but at the cost of creating a slightly less fallout-like experience. - Laser weapons now have a beam instead of shooting a projectile. - World is large, so more to explore. - Certain designs were improved. CONS: - Badly redesigned weapons. - Awful writing. Just awful. - Very bad glitched engine. - Faces look bad. And I'm talking REAL bad. You'll notice it very soon. - Perishable foods somehow manage to survive 200 years? - Brotherhood of Steel for some reason turns into the Wasteland police instead of greedy technology hoarders.  - Takes place on east coast. Screw the east coast. Seriously. Fallout should always be on the west coast.  - Butchers classic Fallout lore. - And most of all, it isn't an RPG. It's a terribly made shooter with RPG elements that aren't taken seriously and can easily be abused by any dumbsh!t to become a pseudo god by level 15.",

Do I recommend playing it? Maybe. Is it a terrible game? No. There, I said it. Moving on.   Here's my main gripe: FO3 is what happens when you take a fantastically written post-apocalyptic game series and hand the rights over to a company whose writers appear to be 12-year-olds.  Imagine a world where every city, every store and every household is an entity separate from the surrounding world. Nothing has an effect on anything else. There's a town a miles down the road with a problem with Raiders? Yeah, that doesn't really affect this storekeeper couple. Heaps of radscorpions make life a living hell for a bunch of settlers living in a run-down village? Yeah, that has no bearing on this other community a stone's throw away, their only problem pertains to fixing their fertility robot. Oh, and getting their hands on a vacuum tube located 20 miles away because reasons.  When you have dozens of locations with seemingly no connection to one another or the main plot, you end up with a huge sandbox that barely resembles the intricate interconnected plots of the first two games. That's Fallout 3's setting in a nutshell. Real world doesn't work like that. If your counter-argument is 'this is a game, not the real world lol' you're completely missing the point. Fallout 1 and 2 came out years before FO3 and yet they still managed to accomplish a sense of reality - albeit a very far-fetched and sometimes tongue-in-cheek one.  Take Fallout 2, where you have a complicated, interconnected political web between New Reno, Redding, Vault City and NCR. Take Fallout: New Vegas where everything rotates around the ongoing conflict between NCR and Caesar's Legion. Everyone has a say in this, everybody is affected. Your choices affect the outcome and the ongoing power structure. That's how you write a game. And that's where FO3 falls flat on its face.  The main plot is bland. I felt like I had no reason to follow the PC's dad. Instead I ran around, doing quests here and there, fetching this and killing that, getting little satisfaction from the caps and experience I accumulated. It wasn't really rewarding. None of it. Just a mindless, momentary distraction on the road to the grave.  Oh, and the metro tunnels suck.",

Even if you fix those issues with mods, it still feels like a generic FPS. In other words the game starts off as far worse than most FPS games and modded becomes a crappy FPS game.  The graphics are terrible, even if you mod the textures the game is still plagued with massive pop-in that makes the landscape change before your very eyes in a very immersion breaking way. The enemy design manages to be simultanteously too ridiculous to take seriously and too gross for me to want to look at. And the dialogues with other characters still have the ridiculous zoom that looks like you are walking up to a mannequin.  As for the story, so far I haven't cared about any of the characters. Everyone's either a jerk, or insane. I guess it reinforces the whole 'fend for yourself' thing, but it doesn't really catch my interest.",

Those games have writing full of wit, sarchasm, heart and soul, and the writing in this game feels incredibly sterile comparatively. When you accomplished a task in those games, it actually felt like you accomplished something. Yes that is in part due to the time spent in menus, running thru areas, etc. However, the uneasy feeling you get playing those games is commesurate with the whole experience. Desolate wasteland, sparsely populated, with more bad than good left. Quests could be completed in a multitude of ways, and I don't just mean good and bad. The Black Isle (Now inexile and obsidian) guys did some great stuff.  For us older Fallout fans, the comparison is necssary. While this game suffers from the sterility of Bethesda writing, (lets face it..they design great environments and litter them with bland npcs and quests..quantity over quality), they still manage to capture a retro 50s vibe and many nods to fallout. For me, the DC wastes were a plus as I am a fan of American history (not the sanitized version they teach kids either). The game looked great for 2008, and played ok. It is extremely dumbed down for an rpg of Fallout's lineage, but that is why it is a good game. As much as it pains me to say this, the old fallouts didn't age well, and even back 17 or 18 years ago, were very obtuse. Yes, the way rpgs should be. While us RPG fans loved it, they were not as marketable. Bethesda wanted to make a game many would buy. The scores the game got prove this. The reason Bethesda even owns the IP is because the CRPGS were not doing well. Graphics and flash got in the way. Now that we are used to the 'next gen grapics', as they've been around roughly a decade, the desire for gameplay and substance over flash is returning. This is evidenced by the killing D:OS and WL2 made.   The formula in this game is fun and addicting. I am not as harsh on it as other members of the fallout famdom. If this was just an original IP, it wouldn't get that hate. Many fans felt as if Bethesda 'ruined' their IP with zero chamce of redemption. Until they let Obsidian make New Vegas..  If you want a fun Lite RPG (no complex char design, choices don't mean that much, followers suck, too easy etc), FPS style with a cool retro vibe, buy it. It's cheap now. Fans of the OG fallouts, I am sure you already have an opinion lol. I never had expectations of it being like the other games, as I thought the isometric CRPG was dead (it's not! :) ). Therefore, I enjoyed my time with this game, and all the expansions, for what it is. If I didn't have the meterstick of games designed by what I consider the Beatles of the CRPG, this game would be a lot better for me. Oh, obviously I didn't play this version on steam much. All my hours were on 360. I would replay it, but why when I have 1, 2, and NV to replay, along with a dozen or more other great rpgs and the incoming crop of new ones.",

It may not be what 'hardcore' fallout fans may hope for. but honestly I am tired of the over griping that comes with people of late.  Why is it that everyone loves games like call of duty which is nothing more a mind numbing shoot fest and yet they gotta pick apart games like this that actually offers a ton of options. This game has hundreds of hours of gameplay and combined that with the TON of mods out there for it. Honestly i wish there were more games like this out there. Im not a huge fan of the shooter games of late but this game has an interesting world and lots to do   if you are new to the fallout series id highly recommend buying this! if you get it now. Now is a great time to do so beacause you can get this game and then get new vegas (highly recommended too! ) you can get a good fallout experence while you wait for fallout 4!  It is a few years old and the graphics may not be as good as newer games but overall i still find it quite fun. For 20 bucks you really cant beat it!",

I liked it but I felt the story fell a little short and got quickly boring as the Mojave desert is about as interesting as it sounds. With the reveal of Fallout 4 however, I wanted to give it another shot but with Fallout 3 instead of New Vegas. And wow, I have never been so blown away...  First of all, the story is amazing. A long intro (one that took me about an hour to get out of the vault and start exploring) but one hell of a setup for a story. The storyline does, however, seem a little short but the expansive wasteland led me to new areas to explore, new towns and new interesting NPCs with unique pre-war backstories. This meant it took me an excessive amount of time to actually get to the places involving the story missions, and so inflating my game time and enjoyment.  Of course the graphics are dated but that does not mean the gameplay is. Bethesda focused on the gameplay overall and wiped the floor with some of today's 'all graphics, no gameplay' titles.   Several unique mechanics are seen in this game, like the VATs system, which is Bethesda's answer to keeping the real-time strategy element from the first game and other's like Fallout: Tactics while implementing first person elements, which were new to the franchise at the time. Other mechanics like the S.P.E.C.I.A.L skills allow you to specify what your character is best at, whether he is strong but stupid, or intelligent but prone to injury. This links to the character's persuasiveness against NPCs. For example, a character with high intelligence would be able to get through to a scientist NPC more than he/she would with a soldier NPC. These mechanics give such incredible role-playing gameplay that lead to Bethesda being renowned artists of the genre, with other titles like Oblivion and Skyrim under their belt.  In conclusion, Fallout 3 is now one of, if not my favourite RPG game out there, and for good reason.",

            "review_text": "Tl;dr 'Skyrim with guns' (Skyrim uses almost exactly the same engine)  I don't have many hours logged because I launch it through the mod manager, not steam.  I've also logged about 1000+ hours on the other 3 times I've bought this game on other platforms, or rebuying it because it broke or got stolen.  I would rate this game as the second-best game of all time (behind Pokemon Emerald, in case you're curious.) I could describe this game for hours on end and it wouldn't do it justice at all. You need to experience it for yourself. And it's absolutely essential that you get the GOTY edition.  This game has thousands of hours of replay value if you know what you're doing. The first time I played this game, I only did the main quest, and finished the game in about 24 gameplay hours (if you don't have the DLC, you can't keep playing after you beat the main quest.) I don't recommend playing this way. Then I made a second character (there are virtually unlimited save slots, even on console), and discovered all of the sidequests, DLC, the radio (IMO the best part about the game and the biggest difference between Fallout 3 and New Vegas), and started to get totally obsessed. At this point I have a profile that is level 30 (highest level with DLC) with max of all skills and SPECIAL (I love the leveling system in this game, btw) in under 48 gameplay hours, because I've memorized most of the game at this point. So you'd think I'd be bored of the game, right? Wrong. Play the game until you get tired of it, and then get into the MODS. Easily doubles gameplay hours.  You can really get into the roleplaying if you want. It's surprisingly immersive. If immersion isn't your thing, there are several things in the game that bring you back to earth. For example, your father is voiced by Liam Neeson. I constantly break RP and refer to him as Liam Neeson.  I don't have to tell you how to play the game, since you can do whatever you want, really. There are several 'classes' that I make my characters into: Big guns tank, small guns or energy weapons (frail but deadly), sneak assassins (obscenely overpowered if you do Operation Anchorage DLC), unarmed tank, melee weapons specialist, etc. If you level your character correctly you can be all of them and carry an arsenal with you. Do whatever you want and treat your first character as a throw-away, then get serious with your second or third character.   The character creation was revolutionary for its time, but it's fallen behind more modern ones. I almost always make my character female, because there's a perk at level 2 that gives you a 10% damage bonus to the opposite gender, and most of the people you'll be killing are male.  10/10 would purchase a fifth time.",

Really its about going in blind more than anything else. the first experiance with this game really left a mark on how i look at games. The clunky models, glitches, and sometimes frustrating game design, are all made up by the ammount of effort that went into it. This is evidfent in the thoughtful creation of an expansive world, that tells a story in it of its self. While i go back now with improved stratiges and tend to abuse game play mechanics, i can not deny the utter joy i had when i first played fallout 3. However its not perfect, as i mentioned there are hundreds of problems with the game. The open mod maker also plays a signifigant role in making up for the issues. It is absolutely best as TTW with your choice of mods, although some FO3 mods may not fit right in the FONV engine.  ",

It is completly boring, irrelevant and nothing worth talking about.

A follow up to the 2004 hit Red Dead Revolver, this game tells the story of former outlaw John Marston, taking players on a great adventure across the American frontier.  Red Dead Redemption features an open-world environment for players to explore, including frontier towns, rolling prairies teaming with wildlife, and perilous mountain passes - each packed with an endless flow of varied distractions. Along the way, players will experience the heat of gunfights and battles, meet a host of unique characters, struggle against the harshness of one of the world’s last remaining wildernesses, and ultimately pick their own precarious path through an epic story about the death of the Wild West and the gunslingers that inhabited it.",

Featuring a long absence from the 90s classics Fallout 1 and 2, Bethesda Softworks brings back Fallout for a new generation. Awaking in an apocalyptic nightmare, your own hope to survive in this new world is to explore, upgrade and befriend or back-stab as many people as you can.  Fallout 3 is a gorgeously realised game not only in its visuals, but the narrative, its atmosphere and the unremarkable but noticable human touches throughout.  Fallout 3 is one to recommend, albeit you can find yourself wandering through a carbon copy of the same underground tunnel or factory at times, but that's nothing to greatly disservice such a great experience.",

It doesn't feel like Wasteland from classic games, but it definitely has something appealing in it's looks. +2. Somewhat liked the main story, that   retro simulation   looks pretty good, even has   a little puzzle.    +3. Repair system. Once again, it is 'kind of' great, allows you to repair stuff -&gt; thus keeping your inventory clean, get some more damage for your gun or 'armor' aka 'damage protection' for your armor or helmet. -1. Totally stupid characters, like that guy Tenpenny. Remember how he   hires some mercs to kill you?  . Why does he even have such relations to do so? Isn't he like all the 'WOO, YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH'? -2. Absolutely stupid DLC. Somewhat liked (yeah, i won't stop from using 'kind of' and 'somewhat' in this review) liked The Pitt, but the rest.. O: Anchorage is the worst CoD clone ever made. CoD made out of kind-of-open-world-rpg. 'Nice' idea. Mothership Zeta got me so bored that I decided not to finish other DLC's. Had a hope for Broken Steel, was planning to do it last, but screw that, i've got enough. -3. 'Open world'. All the locations are totally unnecessary, uncreative and stuff. When you reach the border of 'open world' game just says 'You can't go there, please turn back'. Literally. Remember how 'non-open-world' game called 'Borderlands 2' did? It has some guns which are exterminating you if you don't turn back. EVEN THAT is better than what Fallout 3 does. -4. 'RPG'. Fallout 3 is not an RPG. You don't have to do trading at all, you can get through all the game by looting stuff. That kind of looks nice, right? Guess what - it's not. Just because you have so limited amount of 'skills' to choose from and 'Barter' is one of them. To get successful you'll only need Speech, Lockpicking and Science. Everything else is optional as hell. +4. Surprisingly, Fallout 3 allows you to do stuff different ways. Kill someone or not, negotiate or threaten.  So overall I regret there's no 'neutral' reviews, but looking back to my experience - I'd say  I don't recommend this game  to any RPG and/or Fallout fans. And by 'Fallout fans' I mean people who played Fallout 1/2 when they were a cutting-edge-just-released-wow-nice-graphics games, not the people who started being Fallout fans in Fallout3+ era. No offense intended.",

While I saw that the game was not designed with windows 7/8 compatible I decided to risk it, unfortunately the game is pretty much unplayable. Constant crashes, bugging out and random problems plague this game and while Fallout 3 was never the most stable game to play it was at least playable. While there is a lot of tech support from the community it isn't able to correct all the issues and I can only imagine the problems windows 10 will cause when it arrives in a few months.

Turns out though that Fallout 3 (And this is the only game i know of that does this) is apparently solely dependent on the OS of your computer to function. I followed the guid pinned in the forums so that I could at least get past the intro movie cutscene but Since then I have crashed (approximately) 20 times and i only just got to the part where Enclave shows up at Project Purity. These aren't 'Game crashed and was sent back to desktop' crashes either. These crashes LOCK UP my computer and force me to shut it down manually and restart it. I have no idea why no one was working on a way to make Fallout work with windows 10 in time of it's release, even if it would be minor changes at first due to the relative 'brand new' aspect of the OS.

The Fallout universe is one of the most fascinating and fun places you'll ever visit in your gaming experience. The game itself deserves no less than a 10/10, bugs aside.  This, however, is not a recommendation of the game. I'm urging any PC gamer, Fallout fan or otherwise, to NOT buy this game as it stands. If your OS is anything newer than Windows 7, you won't be able to run this game. Period. The store page warns that it's 'not optimized' for anything Windows 7 or beyond, which is a bold understatement. Instead, it should warn that it is simply unplayable on newer OSs.  There are numerous fixes floating around the modding community or through other programs and some youtube tutorials can help you get it up and running relatively quickly, but this is still an unnecessarily annoying issue.  [See EDIT] Recently, a Limited Edition PC Fallout Anthology has been announced and put up for pre-order in the wake of the Fallout 4 hype (which I snapped up as soon as I could, of course), so I'm hoping that Bethesda will have a compatibility patch in time for its release, which would only seem sensible if they're selling it in 2015. If not, it would be a huge insult to the fans of this great franchise.  I'll revisit this review when I get my Anthology and hopefully have better news, but until then, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC.  TL;DR: The game is ****ing fantastic, but unplayable on PC. Buy New Vegas instead or wait for Fallout 4.  EDIT: The release of the anthology sadly saw no compatability update. Such a shame. It was still worth it for the collector's case and the great older Interplay games, but it still feels like a bit of a cheap shot that Bethesda would sell something exclusive to PC that isn't playable on any recent PCs. To be quite honest, I'm insulted. Apparently, it doesn't take long with mods to get the game running, meaning that the inclusion of a simple update to fix the issue is well within the realm of capability for Bethesda. Sure, some other simple mods fix some of the other numerous bugs, but the game is almost 8 years old so I can let them slide. We can't expect them to fully support a fix for every bug after so long. But one would think that a game-breaking issue would be addressed before the inclusion of the game in a recently released edition. I'm disappointed, Bethesda. *End rant.*",

The game has random moments which makes it really awesome because you wont be expecting common things to happen everywhere and there are many things you can do from picking up scraps to exploding everything up. The plot is very nice and I liked every character in Fallout, the weapons, the armors, the places, everything, I liked everything. The game really punishes you from the start but if you work hard and do quests it gives you this nice feeling of finally being able to kill anything or anyone easily. The game doesnt get boring if you keep playing it, it is fun and you get the same feeling you had when you first started playing the game until the very end. The quests are not repititive and sometimes the quest changes the story, this is another reason why I really like Fallout 3. The gameplay is perfect but one thing i didnt like is how VATS work because it completely changes how first-person shooter games should work and doesnt even need skill to do it, to be honest I also use VATS quite alot but only in those instances where I only have few bullets or when I am having fun. VATS is really cool though but they should change it to not stop time or slow down time when using it. Anything else from the game is perfect and I love it all. The graphics might not be as good as other games but dont let the looks fool you because this game is really amazing and also really long, it's a shame that my friend told me the endings before I completed the game.

The characters have the personality of a rock with a face painted on it, and have no real involvement with the plot other than to serve as bullet sponges and item mules.  It angers me that this game is the most popular in the franchise, when it is so undeserving of the praise it gets. If you played Fallout 1 and 2, skip this one and play New Vegas instead. At least Obsidian actually put considerable effort into the writing of Fallout New Vegas, and it also has a strong relation to the classic Fallout games (NCR makes an appearance, Brotherhood are the tech-hoarding isolationists we came to know and love/hate, etc.). Also, Obsidian is the successor company to Black Isle, so it's essentially the same guys in spirit.  Skip this game. Trust me, you're not missing anything.",

Yeah, there's also level scaling.  Blow up an entire town? Don't worry, you can make up for it by giving water to a homeless guy. The game is heavily dependent on its karma system and people will magically guess if you're good or bad and shun you from places or put hits out on you.  The game ends with a you going into a room full of lethal radiation to die because 'it is your destiny!'

The game runs very well on even lower budget PC so you don't have to wory about the framerate, but there is cost to that which are the graphics which are a bit outdated and also sometimes it takes a while for the textures to load, but if you have a better PC then you can always go to Fallout 3 Nexus and download bunch of mods which might imporve the graphics and overall gameplay  For people who don't mind few small problems the rating is 10/10 but for people who don't like problems like crashses and textures not loading is 9/10  PS.

And fallout 3 is magnificent You see, It truly is limitless freedom if i want i can save the guy next to me Or i could put a couple rounds in his brain and blow his head to bits. I could buy what i want or steal what i need, Even as far as How do i want my character to look and do i want a predetetmined hair color OR do i want to set the dials to make it an awsome shade of purple,blue,pink,orange. You Name it you can pretty much do it And the DLC is quite Good aswell i find my favorite was Operation Anchorage because it not only brings you back to a short time before the great war to see One of the MAJOR events leading up to it. It Gives you powerful gear after you complete the simulation Along with a power armor immediately equipable and will give you power armor training once equiped for the first time. my least favoirte would have to be THE PITT. and even then i Like that one its just I like all the others more than The Pitt, i could put passion and extend JUST HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS GAME, Into this but i thought id keep it simple...As i could. seeming how i ment to write a few sentences and Ended up with a paragraph. Anyway i hope will all my might That you who are window seven and eight will use the fix (Search fix for windows eight fallout 3 or IF YOU OWN THIS GOTY EDITION simple search FALLOUT 3 GOTY EDITION FIX on google thats how i found it its a steam fourmns link) Anyway to wrap up my strongly positive opinion This game is great but, The modding potential For the pc MAKES IT EVEN GREATER.",

            "review_text": "A fantastic open world RPG from the makers of fantastic open world RPG's.  Fallout is a post-nuclear war role playing game set in the vast universe of.. Washington D.C. America being America, they knew people wanted to kill them so they built many many underground shelters called Vaults, which would house people when the bombs fells, so they didn't die or mutate or any of that nasty stuff.  You've spent 18-19 years in Vault 101, and due to your SPOILER deciding to SPOILER SPOILER, you SPOILER. Crazy right!? You get a decent amount of customization of your character - including their ethnicity, facial features and hair - as well as a few basic traits that determine your starting strengths and weaknesses. The introduction isn't annoyingly long (not bad at all if you love making new characters), but isn't unfairly short (teaches you all of the simple mechanics pretty sharpish) and shortly after that is over, you're out of that Vault and staring over the intimidating nuclear wasteland. As I said before, this universe is vast and you are never tied down to one location (except the introduction, and the majority of the downloadable content packs). Similar to Fable and KOTOR, Fallout 3 uses a karma feature. When you're a ♥♥♥♥, you will scare and intimidate some people, making them act differently towards you. On the flip side, when you're a goodie people will like you (unless they themselves are a ♥♥♥♥) and act differently towards you. Either side opens up different skill options when you level up, so there are advantages to both.  I could keep going on and on, but a lot of this stuff is worth exploring for yourself. A few friends have told me they don't like the combat, or the trait system, others have told me they can't get enough of the game. I'd have to suggest finding some gameplay videos.  Aaaaaaand that's me out.",

I think so many players were bothered by Fallout 3 not being as funny or witty as the other games because Fallout 3 is literally the deconstruction of the Fallout universe. It's the real dark nightmares of Fallout, because there's no NCR, there's no Master, no ghoul city... There's nobody out here. The city was annihilated. Whatever's left are just dregs.  In New Vegas you have hope humanity will rebound in one way or another. It's just a question of picking your faction. I mean the Followers of the Apocalypse are already working on ways to replace ancient technology with newer methods that can be reproduced. The NCR has water purifiers. Legion lands are free of raiders. House is a giant mainframe with self-replicating robots at his disposal.  In 3 you have no such hope. In 3, even the Brotherhood of Steel realized it was pointless, the struggle was futile.  It crashes harder than a Fiend on Jet though. There's tricks to making it work better, but save early, save often. Just wish Bethesda re-released this without GFWL.",

It's just amazing how much detail went into creating Washington D.C. and the surrounding areas. Granted, the terrain and scaling may not be realistic, but as far as the cities, buildings, and monuments it's nearly identical. On another note, I've enjoyed the fact that the npc's / ai are fully voiced and actually talk to you compared to a wall of text (example: Morrowind). Story wise (as an alternate history / timeline, that's set in the future), it's very enjoyable and immersive. Because of this, you'll feel like you're actually there. As such, be prepared to easily lose track of time and spend 50 if not 100+ hrs in-game.  Cons: One may be disapointed with the poor performance of the fps targetting. So either use VATs, or download mods that fixes it. Mods are what make this game even more awesome. That being said, I recommend Fallout 3 nexus for mods.",

As for the main story the plot and pace of it are good but it is a little short and if you rush it would probably take you 10 hours to complete. The voice acting is very good with a lot of voice actors for a Bethesda game, not to mention Liam Neeson voice acts your dad in the game! The DLC for this game are great with the exception of mother ship zeta so I would recommend getting the game of the year edition where once you have completed the main storyline the game doesn’t automatically end. Overall this game is very fun, huge in scale and definitely worth your money and time I would personally rate this game 10/10 as I have completed this game and all the main platforms and overall must have spent over 400 hours on the game and enjoyed ever second.

            "review_text": "THIS REVIEW IS FROM THE PS3 Version of FALLOUT 3 including PC With Mods. BUT MOSLY THE PS3 VERSION Fallout 3 Was my first fallout game and introduction into the universe of Fallout and being better than oblivion and skyrim in my opinion.   But. is it a fun game? Well yes and a bit of no but mostly yes. Fallout 3 throws you in to ruined and long gone united states of America in the D.C Ruins also known as Capital wasteland. Emerged from your safe underground shelters known as Vaults. after many years the wasteland became a much harsher place to live in. such danger like bloodthirsty raiders. Mutants created from the radiation from the nuclear bombs. and mostly most feared beast in the wastes, the Deathclaws. (but not really)  After being raised in your vault. your father left the vault door open only to purse his dream for the wasteland. and only to escape the corrupt vault overseer and the vault security force to find your father in the cruel and harsh wasteland and to be togther again (yes thats the story in a nutshell)  But now to Gameplay This is an FPS RPG Game. Well if you shoot things you get XP. Level up and get a Perk. Set your skills to max your pretty much a Jack of all trades (with some expections).  Shooting things like raiders and radscorpions is kind of a hit and miss (Thanks to Ghoul reavers and Albino Radscorpions and Overlords) but you got this mechanic known as VATS. Pretty much a cheat as your in VATS Mode your pretty much invincible for a while with a slow cutscene of you shooting the raider in the eye and being unskipable and slow.  I don't use VATS Alot unlike in New vegas as an Unarmed Player given with Special VATS Attacks. I mostly use VATS As my enemy detector and my finisher move. but i mostly play real time combat without VATS.  You got your Small guns (SMGs, Pistols, Rifles and shotgusn) Big guns like the Flamer and the minigun and then the Energy weapons (Laser rifles, Plasma rifles and then the Gauss rifle)  You also got melee weapons too including unarmed but don't forget Michael bay Explosives  but it lacks a large Weapon rooster from FO2 and a bit from FO:Tactics (The FO1 Plasma Rifle made its way in Vegas As the Plasma Caster including the Plasma Pistol as the Plasma Defender) But the Unique versions of each weapon make up for it as such as a laser rifle shotgun combination being my favorite  but your here exploration then this game is for you! lots of loot and treasures to be found! going to a deathclaw infested place is rewarding giving you uniques but be sure to bring lots frag mines with you or atleast a dart gun and a sniper rifle.  Some quests including the main quest and the dlcs are a hit and miss. As such the vampire attacking a small town in a highway being my least favorite. (yes litterly vampires) Fallout is known for good and evil and very very evil and heartwarming tearjerking good decisions but i mostly play as a neutral karma mercenary  who stays in the middle in the see-saw listening to his shoulder angels like from that movie and cartoon. I Mean that lady in a house who accuses you for working for someguy named moriarty i mean oh my gosh what im i supposed to say if im talking like a jerk which is out of place for my character and no option to say *Nevermind im out of here -leave* rather than going the good thing or just killing her for evil lulz  Characters are good and mixed. Three dog being the likeable and talking about you (for some reason for one person unlike the tale of the vault dweller or the choosen one) Moria being cheerful and okay. Some characters being evil and make you want to punch them with your power fist. but you can't kill one of these guys except Three dog and Moria being killable.  The Main story characters and Rivet city are infamous for this i mean you can melt anyone to goo unlike in FO1&amp;2 and Tactics Heck even in New Vegas. Look at Skyrims NPCs You can't kill one of these guys for some silly quest runing away from guards. Thats not right. i would rather go for the wild card path in New Vegas instead.  Theres a Karma system in this game. i mostly play Neutral Karama just give free water to some water beggars and make your decision for the more rewarding in a quest. But i don't play as a total jerk as i play as a mercenary looking for caps.  What is missing is the Traits and the Reputation system but that returned in New vegas and i hope it does in Fallout 4 along with low intelligence dialouge which is unlikely since i loved that in FO1 And 2.  Fallout 3 is a fun game to explore around like saving that kid from fire breathing ants. and shooting slavers in paradise falls freeing the kids and shooting the slaver leader and then shooting some scavengers and wastelands for evil lulz.  but it has it's flaws around in circules. the game gets easy even in normal settings and playing very hard turns some of the enemys into bullet sponges from my chinese assault rifle and even its unique counter part. Some of the parts of the game will run slow and freeze or crash. Bugs like that ghoul reaver glitch turning into a mini super deathclaw twitching around like those dead space's twitchers nercomorphs expect takes alot of shots from a gauss rifle to take down in very hard.  it has a bit of a Lackluster combat and VATS for being a silly mechanic.  I Would recomend you to play this with mods as such as Wanderer's Edition and some Fallout Classic weapons or some Overhaul. But Fallout 3 in PC Is Not optmized for Windows 7 but i use Win7 Home Premium and some workaround you can find in the guides but if your using Windows 8 or higher you might have problems with little to no ends.  Fallout 3 was a Fun game but when i played New vegas &amp; then Fallout 1 and 2 and then Wasteland 2. Its still a okay game.   I give it a 7.8/10  loved it when i got my hands in GOTY For the PS3 But as i said. Its what brought me as a fallout fan.",

I've put thousands of hours into this game on my Xbox (before I stopped being a filthy console peasant), and a few hundred on my PC (Using a custom launcher that for some reason didn't add play time to steam), and not a single minute was wasted.   The game follows the main protagonist, a vault dweller, whose father had committed the cardinal sin of leaving the vault to venture into the irradiated nuclear wasteland for an unknown purpose. The vault dweller, shunned by the other members of the vault and at risk of being killed as punishment for his/her father's crime, is forced to flee after their father into the harsh and unforgiving 'Capital Wasteland' to search for answers. The player is free to adventure across the vast wasteland surrounding post apocalyptic Washington DC, meeting slavers, bandits, mutated creatures and other survivors. There are countless settlements, derelict buildings, caves, underground train networks etc to explore, each containing their own piece of back story and perils, ranging from a renovated tower full of 'privileged' people who live above a network of ghouls who want nothing more than to get in, to the withered remains of the white house or the DC monument.  Following the main questline is recommended but not essential, and there are hundreds of side quests to follow, unique items to collect and moral dilemmas at every turn (such as whether to detonate a nuclear bomb killing an entire town of people for cash or not). If you've seen the recent announcement of Fallout 4 and wasn't sure if spending £49.99 on the pre order is a good idea, buy this game and put some time into it. It's made by Bethesda, a company renowned for the Elder Scrolls series of games, so if you are a fan of those, chances are, you'll be a fan of this!",

GO PLAY THIS BAD BOY!! Anyways, the whole game is a great creation. From the gun mechanics to the melee combat. Roaming around doing the main quests (either DLC and Main story) or any side quests (from mods or the base game and DLC) has you fighting for your life, talking to various loads of VERY unique NPCs , finding loot, whether weapons or armor. This game is loads of fun plus with the right mods (you're on PC for a reason!!!) This game can look better then vanilla Skyrim.

If this sounds like ramblings of a lunatic, well... you're not far off, but I'll attempt to clarify.  As a spiritual successor to installments 1 and 2 of the series, this game fails miserably. Apart from a very vague feeling that all this is kinda like fallout, there isn't much else here to satisfy the cravings of a fan of the original games. Move along.  However, this is still a solid (and typical) bethesda product, with its flaws and strengths. More or less everything about this game is the way it is in other installments in the elder scrolls series, with a few timid attempts to implement original fallouts' features (no more about that, though, since this is supposed the part where I actually complement the game). Yes, all the things you've had in morrowind and oblivion are here: a pretty short main quest line, which is hardly the poing anyway, lots of space for exploration, a decent number of side quests, some of which come with moral choices.  The game does deviate, understandably so, from TES leveling system, once again attempting to emulate the original, where you get to spend points on skills and perks once you've gathered enough experience points to level up.  To summarize, I would put it this way: it is a good game, it's just not a fallout game.",

The person who thought that instead using VATS constantly in the game would be 'fun' should be fired. Especially if you take a companion with you, battles become laughably unrealistic.  The wasteland is a hostile, empty and large area. nothing more nothing less. and the little that there is is copy and paste. There is no reason to hunt certain wildlife. the game instead rewards you more for avoiding them, since they are never dropping something noteworthy. Wildlife always feels like as if they were just spawned into the world. scorpions and deathclaws have their environments that they spawn in but they dont feel like as if they 'did' anything. ANYTHING. In the sidequests you frequently meet people who dont tell you the truth. I found that to be a feature with potential. But in general most quests give the feeling like as if they were ment to be 'funny'. Funny quests would be ok/good if they were part of a wider spectrum of quest characters in general. But beeing just 'funny' as they are, the whole game feels underperforming. In a hostile world i want to find scary things. Bad guys do bad things, do they? Well ok , you can stop slavers and an evil organization from doing their evil things but it has no real effect on the world. The biggest achievement in the world is to generate purified water. Ok, its something relevant in this world. but aside from that? I cant think of a place that was flourishing up after me having cleared out the bad guys there.  If you want a game for your kids enjoyment, buy them Fallout 3. If you want a serious shooter in a hostile world, get Stalker - Shadow of Chernobyl or Clear Sky.",

That is because I've always played Fallout 3 with mods that needed 'FOSE' (like SKSE from Skyrim but for Fallout 3).   It is old, it has bugs, and errors, and it is a pain in the a** to get it to run in Windows 7/8/10 (it is not that hard, really). But after all that, it is worth it. And thanks to the awesome and great community this game has, it is now much easier than before.    I always come back to play it. I've finishsed and restarted the game more than 10 times and each time was like a different game. Some times I discovered something new, others made something in another way.  I could make a long and precise description and walkthrough of the game, or a quest, but I won't. There are plenty of gameplay videos and guides you can watch too, but I don't recommend that either. The beauty of this game is to play it yourself, make your own choises. Every person has played this game in a different way.  You like shooters? This game is for you.  You don't like shooters? This game is also for you.  You think weapons are for pu*****? This game is for you too.  You like stealth and planning your combats? This game is for you as well.  You like rambo style, mayhem, explosions? This is definitely a game for you.  You like to be the heroe, the 'good guy'? Guess what, this game is for you.  You wan to join the dark side and be public enemy number one? No need to guess, this game is for you too.  I think now you get the picture.  If you played and liked open world rpg games like Fallout 4, or Skyrim, you must play this game. It is similar in some ways but different in so many. I will only say this. The main difference is the 'karma' factor. In Fallout 3 you can make choises, a lot of them, during quest or just wandering through the wasteland. And those choises will make your character more 'good', or 'evil'. And depending on your karma, you will be available to have different followers or not. Do a quest in a unique way. Or not be available to take that quest at all. Random events and encounters will be different. And a big and long etc.   I NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR: THE “TEST OF TIME” AWARD    ",

I have 88 hours on this particular version, with about 200+ hours on the PS3 version that introduced me to the Fallout universe. I have since played New Vegas and Fallout 4 and loved them as well, but to me Fallout 3 will always have a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. place in my heart.   I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it before. The main story line can be completed in a weekend, but the side quests, random encounters and lore will keep you going for a very long time. The amount of content in the Fallout games is staggering, with this installment in the series having IMO the best content of all. The 5 DLCs that come with the Game of the Year version are IMO some of the best DLCs in any game ever, Mass Effect 2's Leviation and Shadow Broker DLCs coming in a close second.   If you have a newer machine running Windows 7 or newer (about 99% of you) I would recommend hopping over to Nexus Mods after you install this game and download the Fallout 3 unofficial patch. It will take care of almost all the PC bugs this version had. There is also a .ini file fix for multicore processors that is easy to implement.   I cannot praise this game enough, for me and many others it is the pinnacle of storytelling in the Fallout universe. I highly recommend this game for the advertized $19.99, even more so if it's on sale.",

It's not a massively difficult game, it has an annoying level-cap, the graphics suffer from occasionally horrendous pop-up and it's still as buggy as hell. Of course, modifying the hell out of the game can solve all but one of these issues, but for the vanilla version, these problems really SHOULD put people off of buying this (if they already haven't, of course!)  BUT! (and this is a massive Rosie O'Donnel size but!) none of these faults prevent this from being one of the most enjoyable and immersive games of the last decade. The game is huge. That's not an understatement - even without the add-ons, Fallout 3's world is staggeringly huge. The sheer volume of quests available will ensure lastability, and i'm not even counting the multitude of tiny little side-quests that don't pop up in your quest status. I'm on my 9th play-through of the GotY (I bought this originally on the *cough* 360, in early 2007 - in fact, this game was my sole reason for buying the console) and i'm still discovering new areas and little details that i'd never previously seen.  It offers multiple ways to play - you can blast everything that moves, you can talk your way through a large bulk of the quests here, you can be a sanctimonious goody-two-shoes, as neutral as a Swiss wastelander, or be as evil, scuzzy and downright Lucifer-like as you please. The array of weapons, armour and equipment at your disposal is second only to its lesser 'sequel'. I know many people prefer New Vegas, but personally I felt that something was lost. Maybe it was all the greenery, the copious amounts of insects, the weapon/ammunition modification options (which I found, for the most part, more intrusive than useful - just give me guns and ammo and show me where to point!) Don't get me wrong, New Vegas is wonderful in it's own way, but to me it's still Fallout 3's younger and not-quite-as-clever sibling.  This really is a must-have title for fans of RPG's - a truly landmark title, which is a phrase I use sparingly - and i've been gaming for 31 years. If you haven't played it, climb out from under that rock and get it. If you have, stop nodding in agreement, and go play it again!",

But this game quickly became my all time favorite game, replacing The Elder Scrolls which held my favorite game slots for the last 15 years. The PC version of Fallout is even better than the 360 version because I get to use mods, regain access to places vanilla Fallout denied me after completing and add all new stuff to do, expanding a game I'd already played several hundred, perhaps even over a thousand hours on in the 360 version. It is the only game I never get bored with and have played through start to finish and after the finish 20+ times and I still am discovering new things in the open world.  If you liked the newer Elder Scrolls games, you may want to try this series made by the same company.

Fallout 3 is about the bitter strugle for survival in the wastes, while Fallout New Vegas is about the rebuilding of civilization. The Fallout Trilogy works fine on win 7, 8 like fallout 3 and new vegas, but will require some troubleshooting due to its age.

Fallout 3 has to be one of the very best post-apocalyptic RPGs I have  ever  played in my entire 16 year-old life, and this does not go without reasoning.  From the moment you step out of the Vault (or the moment you're   pushed out of your momma  , because yes - that happens in-game.), to the moment you pick up the  Experimental MIRV  and loudly exclaim  'I run this ♥♥♥♥.' , Fallout 3 is nothing but solid 24k gold.  Fallout 3 came out in late 2008, about 6 years ago. Should this affect the way you look at the game? Not one bit. Sure, the engine might be a tad outdated, the texture department may have pulled a bit of a shorter straw compared to other aspects, but none of this means this game is worth passing up.  Now, the game might not be for everyone, but Bethesda definitely made an effort in assuring that each aspect of the game is well rounded, and that each player can find a play style that suits them - and when I say that, I truly mean it. There are a lot of games that for instance will tell you that you can choose how you want to play, but then in the end will penalize you for playing a certain way. (Hitman: Absolution comes to mind, even though I love that game.) Fallout 3 is  not  one of these games.  While your choices aren't as radically diverse as in Fallout: New Vegas, you can still choose whether you want to be a good guy, a little  across the board , or just straight up vile, and it does this really well. No matter where you go, what you do, the game never fails to present you with both good and bad choices. You want to defuse a large nuke that sits right in the center of a wasteland settlement? Do it. You want to attach an explosive device to that same nuke, travel halfway across the wastes, and watch the town go  boom  as you enjoy a nice cold Nuka-Cola in the setting sun? Go right ahead.  All in all, everything from the amazing tone and setting of the game, to the hilarious yet somehow extremely well-fitting music you can find on the in-game radio station(s), Fallout 3 captivates you like no other. If you're feeling like going on an epic post-apocalyptic adventure, and can afford to dish out the €19.99 (or €9.99 for the regular version with no DLC), I suggest you do so.  Fallout 3 is a game that should not be missed for anything in the world, so try not to.   10/10 ",

In NV, it's fairly easy to just ignore the plot--something I enjoy doing in sandbox games, but in Fallout 3, it's guaranteed you will wander back into the plot over and over again. It makes the replay value of Fallout 3 significantly decrease.   Nearly all of the DLCs are utter crap. The alien one had a lot of potential, but wasn't explained well enough to really be enjoyable for me. The Pitt made me angry due to not having enough choices, though I understand it wanted me to make difficult choices. (I wanted to not kidnap the baby but free the slaves.) That said, the Enclave DLC is required if you want to continue the game after you finish the plot, and the lighthouse DLC was filled with brilliance.

While still a bit glitchy here and there, post-release fan mods have opened this game up like supercharged street car, and there is an almost unending amount of customization and replay because of it. If you are at all a fan of wide-open sandbox format, Mad Max style post-apocalypse and/or getting to blow people to chunky bits, play this game.

Fallout 3 is a serious upgrade from Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics, as it was made years later and utalized Real Time Combat and 3D graphics, making it more enjoyable for some people. While I enjoyed Fallout and Fallout 2, Fallout 3 is of course my favorite because there is way more stuff to do, I like the combat better, and I love the storyline. The guns are pretty awesome, especially with the Alien weapons from the DLC which turn most enemies into piles of ash. The storyline is pretty awesome, and I'm not going to say any spoilers of course. The games large amount of quests and crazy encounters make this game have a high replay value, cause once you finish it you want to go back in and do it again. Overall, this game is well worth the money. Just remember to buy Game of the Year Edition, it's only $20 but it's much better than having to buy the DLC later. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed the Elder Scrolls series, other RPG games of this kind, or had enjoyed the previous Fallout games.",

Bethesda made sure all of the staff on this played both the original Fallout and Fallout 2 and it shows in their treatment of making a classic new again.

It is the most perfect blend of action, role-playing, shooter, atmosphere, storyline, and Immersion of any game I have played so far.

Period  - The connections between past and present are VERY solid and prove they made sure to include the things that actually matter.  - The 50s theme is very interesting. Generally post-nuclear War themes would be full of more modern computers and vehicles, yet on this game the systems are old and vehicles are basically nonexistent.  - The radio is a very interesting add-on...it makes you wonder if Bethesda did want to make an addition like that for the Elder Scrolls, but since it wouldn't be a radio then what? A bard follower maybe that'd make music? Perhaps. He could have even talked about the latest rumours in the realm.  - The lore is fun. It is a mix of the reality of half of the 20th century and a whole century made-up post 50s. It makes it an odd combination because the player knows those things didn't happen, but then they could have. War with China? Invasion of Alaska? Cool!  - It's like playing the Elder Scrolls but with guns. Once I really got into it, it was less difficult to experience this.   - The voices. They don't bother me much. Generally for games like this one might skip the dialogue too often after a few hours of gameplay. Diablo 3 got me listening until i got to act 2; past act 3 they can shove the rest of the dialogue up the ♥♥♥.  I tried not to give too much away...  The Veredict? 5/5",

            "review_text": "Fallout 3: Tunnel Snakes Rule  Although we all knew it was there hiding behind the curtain, it’s nice to finally know that Fallout 4 is, indeed, a real thing. And, surprisingly. coming this year at that! With the recent announcement, I thought I would write about one of my favorite Bethesda games, Fallout 3.  I think it’s safe to say that for many of us, Fallout 3 was our first introduction to the series as a whole. Not to say that Fallout 1 and 2 were not popular games, but being the fourteen-year-old I was in 2008, it’s easy to believe many gamers like myself were introduced to the series with Bethesda’s take on the famous franchise.  Going from an isometric turn-based RPG to a first person “shooter” is definitely a massive sea change. Although I wasn’t invested, I remember hearing some people were disappointed in the changes that a first-person perspective brought (and I can totally understand why), but Fallout 3 is still a game that I look back on, seven years later, with wonderfully fond memories.  One of the things, I think, that made Fallout 3 great was that while the world was rather vast and empty, that feeling of “emptiness” was very fitting for a world ravaged by nuclear war. There were pockets of life and activity, and you would randomly stumble across creatures or bandits out in the wilderness, but it wasn’t exactly “dense”. The game struck a nice balance between you finding encounters, and encounters finding you. It always seemed like, given enough time and walking, something interesting would happen. Whether it was being attacked by horrible Super Mutants in Downtown Washington, or stumbling upon a homestead that has seceded from what is left of the government.  The world had flavor. And that made it fun to explore.  Much like it’s predecessor, TES IV: Oblivion, Fallout 3 had a rather... ‘off’ feeling to it. Which was, in some ways, a great contrast to the bright 50’s aesthetic of the game world. While at the same time fitting for its post apocalypse setting. There was a nice conflict between what the world “was” and what it had become.  In Fallout 3, it felt like just about every abandoned home you entered had some kind of tragedy waiting to be discovered. Whether it was the remains of a family scattered through a home, or a suicide note left by a survivor. There were so many little details tucked away in the various places of the D.C. Wasteland. These touches made the world feel “lived in.”  Aside from the general “lived in” quality that Fallout 3 had, there were plenty of disturbing moments which were hidden in the world too. Walking into a school that had been taken over by cannibals, and seeing their “food supply” strewn across the floor… Exploring downtown and being ambushed by horrible mutants. Investigating a murder, committed by wannabe vampires… And of course, going down into some of the abandoned Vaults hidden in the wasteland… For a game made by a company notorious for stiff game design. There were some very good moments in the game, whether scripted or not.  For instance, Vault 108 was very memorable for me because it was full of Garys.  Gary had been cloned, many, many times, his clones were insane and hostile to all non-Garys. Eventually the Garys killed everyone else in the Vault, causing it to fall into disrepair. It was unsettling to walk into the silent rusted hallways of the Vault, only for the silence to be shattered by gunfire and unrelenting battlecry of: “Gaaarrrryyyyy? Gaaaarrryyy!!!!” And having three madmen, or truthfully three of the same madman, trying to rip your throat out.  Bethesda used the isolation in many of the Vaults to great effect. I specifically remember Vault 87. A crusty, dilapidated Vault, filled with Super Mutants and Centaurs. The isolation, the oppressively low ceiling and close walls. Combined with the darkness, large amounts of human remains, and the overall nastiness of the enemies made for a very memorable experience. When the game was new, I remember playing through this area at two in the morning. While I was slowly making my way through the tense halls of the Vault, a dog started barking outside. I remember peering through the blinds trying to figure out what was going on... Before I realized the game had stressed me out and I was reacting to the stress.  But nothing came close to the Dunwich building, although it wasn’t the scariest thing in the game, it was certainly the most upfront about it. In most cases the tension was due to thinking you’re alone in a quiet, dark, place and suddenly being shot or attacked by monsters. However, the Dunwich building had special scripting for its events. There was nothing like it in the rest of the game, and I think that’s why it was so memorable. It was a little, creepy, gem left to be discovered. Uncovering what happened to the people there was very interesting and, simultaneously, off putting with a wonderfully creepy easter egg waiting for you at the end. I highly recommend checking it out.  Well done, Bethesda.  While the world of Fallout was certainly fun to explore and become familiar with, the mechanics of the game itself were, unfortunately, pretty clunky. Shooting was stiff, and in some cases felt quite weak. There was nothing worse than shooting someone in the head, getting a bad damage roll, and watching them shrug off a bullet like it was a spit ball.  However, what made the shooting in Fallout memorable was V.A.T.S. or, the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System.  This is the mechanic that made Fallout 3 for me, V.A.T.S. allowed you to pause time and select individual parts of your opponents, then shoot said targets. Plus, V.A.T.S. would show your shots in amazing slo-mo cinematic glory! It made the combat feel pretty epic. There was nothing better that blasting an annoying NPC in the face with a shotgun, watching their head fly apart in slo-mo, and then reloading your previous save to continue on.  “This Moriarty guy is infuriating…” *quick save* *murder* *quick load*  Seeing your dude shoot at the enemy, watching the killing bullet travel from the gun barrel into their head, and seeing it explode into a chunky red mist all from a cinematic camera angle was… satisfying...  Throwing a grenade into a group of bandits running at you with murderous intentions, seeing it sail through the air, land at their feet, and then watching their feet fly in six different directions was… satisfying…  Running up to a guard, punching him to death, and watching his body explode into little chunks because of the perk “bloody mess” was… hilarious…  Unfortunately, V.A.T.S. didn’t completely circumvent the clunky nature of the game, but it did make it tolerable, and in many ways wonderfully endearing. V.A.T.S. was, by far, my favorite part of Fallout 3 It was, and still is, a unique and interesting mechanic, that spiced up combat. And the idea of using it in the upcoming Fallout 4 is getting me hyped.  And hype is bad, hype is the game killer.  Now, as you may or may not know, Bethesda games are famous for being incredibly moddable. They come with a complete suite of tools used solely for the purpose of creating new original content for the game itself. Fallout 3 is no exception.  There are some amazing Fallout 3 mods floating around out there… and some really weird ones. If you feel like the game is missing something, chances are someone made a mod for it. Just be warned… There are a lot of… “adult” mods too. But, hey, if that’s your thing... They got your back!  The modding communities for Bethesda games are spectacular, there are some great gems out there on the internet. Sometimes you just gotta do some digging to find them. Just go in with an open mind, remembering that the game is from 2008, and expect some amount of ‘jank’ and you’ll be fine.  It might look and feel dated, but damn there’s a fine game in there.",

And by 'story-rich' I don't mean the let's read an interactive picture book indie dime-a-dozen thingy that's peppered all over Steam these days. I'd beg someone to shoot me now, in the forehead, before going there. By 'story rich', I mean complex with different endings and snappy dialogue and voice acting (see Dragon Age. Or Neverwinter nights 2. Or even Mass Effect). Yes, the higher budget stuff.  Fallout 3 had a 'story-rich' tag so I gave it a shot. It's not 'story rich.' Ok, so child seeking parent via various foiled quests and vice-versa is a time-honored plot device to be sure, but this is not in the scale of epic adventure of the parenthetically named games above. I never considered Skyrim to be 'story rich' either.  The detail here was good. The plausibility of some of the human crazy made it less pretty than Skyrim (same makers, very familiar engine and first person perspective) but so much better. Strange religions? Dog eat dog world? Clean water as a prime motivator? Sure. Hell, skirmishes and even wars were fought over water throughout history.   The voice acting was terrible. Not quite on the bad side of good like the original Resident Evil cheeseball writing, just plain bad. With 2 men and women voicing the entire thing and a silent protag (always bad) it's hard not to slide down that side of the bell curve.   Dialogue option win. I really do like getting the option of saying 'F you', twice, to someone. It can be cathartic in some cases, especially this game given main plot events. After all, there are times when an F bomb is the only right answer.  The radio bit was a great immersive detail. Travelling in and out of range of various radio towers, different channels giving different style news. Radio static. Old timey music as a soundtrack.......'Set the world on fire' in a post nuclear wasteland? Nice.  And the humorous commentary on the food that would somehow survive 200 years. Frozen salisbury steak, spam, and bottled Coke. Sure. Why not? I just want to know where all the twinkies got off to ala Homer Simpson.  Three words: giant naked molerats.  I only explored about a 3rd of the map. I find sandboxes tiresome, boring, and repetitive (and lacking in plot motivators). As much as I wanted to be completionist about it, I could not. So I jumped to the end and won. Yay me for saving the day. Main plot done, I'm done because the prime motivator is gone, but you can go off and explore and complete as many side quests as you like after. Though why you'd want to...  Even so, recommended overall. As ugly as a post nuclear landscape is I found this one much more compelling than elder scrolls and I fully intend to purchase the Fallout 4 after they issue the first patch.",

He then moved onto Butch and did the same thing, though this time with a baseball bat.

The game starts off slow at first - after arguably one of the best tutorial sequences ever made in gaming, you might get overwhelmed by so much wasteland out there, so much to explore. But you'll manage, just like I did. This is literally skyrim with guns. There are so many quests, so many locations, so many enemies, types, races, characters, weapons, etc. The gunplay isn't that good at first, but once you get used to no aim down sights and the horrible weapon spread, or even using VATS (Pro tip: Don't (Well, except for gr)), It'll be fine. This game has a lot of moral and ethical choices, and does a wonderful job of making you feel proud or ashamed of what you've done. NPCs will praise you on the radio, or condemn your actions. The game gives you karma for many of the actions you do: making you feel bad for pickpocketing or stealing, but making you feel amazing for giving the homeless bum outside of town a free glass of pure water. I don't know what more to say, really. The graphics are dated, and fov is best changed via console commands, but those are minor, really. Great story. Plus is has Liam Neeson.

            "review_text": "NOTE: I already have a couple of hundred hours in F3 on my Xbox.  This is without doubt one of the all-time RPG classics. Reimagining the seminal post-apocalyptic setting of the old top-down Fallout games in the immersive open-world, first-person style of Bethesda games (the Elder Scrolls series), Fallout 3 is a rich and engaging experience. It's the only game I've played that starts your character's story arc with his/her own birth (tastefully but effectively executed). The opening then moves through a few key stages of his/her upbringing in the oppressive safety of an underground Vault before bringing that little world down around your ears and kicking you into the Wasteland. An innocent abroad, you make your way across post-apocalypse Washington, D.C. (and some of the surrounding region) in search of your disappeared father, and find adventure, danger, a host of colorful characters, and, hopefully, new purpose along the way.  The Vault prologue is somewhat slow, but extremely effective and rarely altogether tiresome. The Wasteland is colorful and impactful, its artfully reimagined and humorously upbeat 1950s-retro feel deliberately and powerfully clashing with its ruined and dilapidated state. New societies sway you - in person and over radio waves - to join their ranks while mutated creatures and sadistic bandits hunt you in the lawless hills. Small towns and conclaves dot the wastes, each with its own troubles and agendas, and a gratifying variety of retro-sci-fi armaments protect you in the spaces between. The D.C. ruins, while especially hazardous, are phenomenal in their stylized recreations of real-world landmarks ranging from presidential monuments to reimagined exhibits in the Smithsonian museums, and also, connecting this decrepit honeycomb, the metro system. The DLC expansions add new flavors to the play scape, between them including the snowy mountains of Alaska, an atmospheric coastal swampland, and, of all things, a huge alien spaceship. Have fun!  Naturally, the game isn't perfect. For most of your play time, regular scuffles with identical three-man mercenary hit squads follow you everywhere you go. The gunplay lacks iron-sight aiming (added in the sequel, Fallout: New Vegas) and relies in large part on calculations based on character skill level, which is fine for a straight-up turkey shoot, but can get a little aggravating when your carefully aimed sniper shot misses its large Super Mutant target and gives away your position. The monochromatic aesthetic can start to drag after a certain number of hours, the main storyline needs to be staged more carefully, and the area map lacks sufficient landmarks to find your destination very quickly when fast-traveling (all points also improved in New Vegas). But these mostly amount to quibbles - the game's great. If you like this sort of thing, stop waffling and buy it.",

There is just so much to do. Want to discover every location? be prepared to spend many, many hours doing so. But also be prepared to kill a lot of ants, mutants and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the process, looting each one anc selling their left over crap to buy better gear and replnish your ammo. Fell like surviving a difficult, post apocalyptic experience? There is a gameplay mode that will force you to drink water and sleep regularly. Just want to run aroung causing mayhem? Oh, that's an easy choice to make and a highly enjoyable one. You can pick which factions you want to ally with and spend your time building your reputation and karma with them to the point that you and they are best friends, or you can just ♥♥♥♥ everyone off and loot the entire world. It's your call.  And that's really what this game is about. You can do whatever you want, really. You can pickpocket and murder all the civilians you meet or you can do favors for them. Either way will get you access to bottlecaps and gear. You can collect all the NukaCola's to turn in later, or drink them as you go.  You can create your own weapons from recipes that you find/steal around the Washington DC area. Weapons like a lawnmower blade which is also on fire. Or a 'launcher' which uses the random crap you find all over the place as ammo and launches it at enemies. Ever feel like killing a mutant with teddy bears, toy cars and baseballs? Yup, this is the weapon for you.  There are large flies, wild dogs, bears, mutants, clam-men, large scary-looking beast with claws, good soldiers, neutral soldiers, evil soldiers, zombie-looking people, good bounty hunters, evil bounty hunters, slave traders, travelling merchants, vampires and more. Pick your side (if you want to) and good hunting!",

I later downloaded the Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch from the Nexus website, and I have yet to freeze, but it probably will after a couple hours of continious gameplay.  I recommend downloading the patch, and simply click F5 on a regular basis to Quick Save just in case your game ever freezes. You should get at least a couple hours of gameplay before it ever freezes. It is unfortunate that Bethesda nor Steam has never done anything to fix this issue but the game itself is worth the occasional freeze, I do enjoy it.",

Over the years I have read many a description on this game detailing its amazing satirical discussion on nationalism and propaganda. Finally, I have delved far enough to see what this talk was about. Indeed, never have I been subject to such a quality, subtle look into such profound concepts in a medium such as this.  The moment I stepped out of the vault and picked up that signal, Enclave Radio, I realized the incredible, obvious truth that has been staring us all in the face. The truth that we have been blind to, that has been filtered away by the media, that we touch on in tired history classes, only to forget as the tests come and go.  We are no longer true patriots of this great and mighty United States of America.  I stayed in Springville for hours on end listening to the eyebot echo the words of my pip boy, the words of that prophet... No... President, John Henry Eden. The only time I faultered was when I could break away from my computer screen long enough to realize that it was a new day and that I needed to renew my pledge of allegience. Eventually, only after being thoroughly certain that my pip boy would carry those great words, those chilling calls to action, no matter where I went, I did progress into the game.  And progress I did. Through a series of mistakes I somehow found myself in support of the Brotherhood of Steel, a confused group who I was only associating with in hopes of opening their eyes of the glory of the new government they simply didn't understand. Oh, but there was no mistake, was there? Not as soon as I had the glorious opportunity to lay eyes and ears on the greatest achievement the United States could hope to replicate: Liberty Prime.  I will not spoil things for my fellow patriots, to give them the chance of self discovery that I had. But let me promise you that not a day has gone by that I haven't spent readying my homemade mini nukes in preparation for the forthcoming final war against communism, painting them in the sacred color pallette of Red White and Blue as I sing the National Anthem and hum to the tunes between the Enclave Radio I have running 24/7, mounted proudly on my wall.   We may not be in an apocalypse that we can visibly see outside of our door, America, but we are without a doubt at risk of losing all that makes this country as free and superior as it is. Fallout 3 has shown me the truth. The Enclave, the Brotherhood, the great nuclear disaster... It is a message, encoded wisely into what so many regard as 'just a computer game.' And we must play that game. We must hear that message. And then we will know.  12/10, Could use a few bug fixes tho",

Mechanics, characters and a whole bunch of other stuff is different from that one, so be sure to check out my  other review . There are interesting characters, ridiculous situations, fun sidequests, ♥♥♥♥ing boring sidequests, and a main story that you won't bother doing. Because giving an old lady her violin is way more important, right guys? In the wasteland, you'll fight super mutants, weird looking mutant crab-things, eye-bots (Note to self: they're not ED-E), the enclave (probably), ghouls and other things. You'll also have access to a wide variety of weaponry, ranging from tire irons to comically sized nuke-launchers firing comically-sized nukes. If you want to play New Vegas but with less gambling and more radiation, this is your game.  Also your dad is Liam Neeson. 10/10  Alright, we're done here.",

Story is not usually the main purpose of Bethesda games anyhow. Great atmosphere and aesthetic (expanded my musical tastes...I actually like some country music now!), solid gameplay, just all around fun. Not much more you can add to that. GOTY edition allows for higher level cap (although there are mods for that), but the main reason you'd want this is for the Broken Steel DLC to have proper closure for the ending.",

I would still recommend Fallout New Vegas over Fallout 3, but I recommend Fallout 3 over Fallout 4. Story: The story in this game is sort of good and bad. The story is very personal, related to your character, and sort of gripping, which I like. The games beginning is VERY memorable with a lot of explanation. Honestly, in the story part of this game, I think Fallout 3 has a good story, but what pisses me off is it is EXTREMELY linear, so its black and white style, and you cannot side with the evil faction. Other than that, the story is good. Overall (8/10) Gameplay: The gunplay in this game honestly is not very good. Most of the time, you will be using VATS. Another really annoying part of this game is there are very few side quests. 17 in total without dlc. 17!! A good amount of the side quests are pretty deep and detailed, which makes them fun to play, but the game gets boring pretty quick. The game is also incredibly easy. Deathclaws can be killed with combat armor and a 10mm pistol. Back to when I am comparing this game to Fallout 4, this game has a Karma system (which was ripped out in 4), which keeps track of the good or evil you have done. Certain companions can only be recruited with a certain type of Karma. Also, the level cap is pretty small, so you need to choose your SKILL POINTS AND PERKS wisely. Also, the dialogue system isnt pathetically bad like in Fallout 4. This allows for several character builds, which I really like. Weapons also have condition, so you need to keep your repair skill up. I also like the dlc in this game. The atmosphere in this game also captures the post apocalyptic feel very well in this game. One major annoyance is if you dont have the broken steel dlc, you cannot play after you beat the game. Its good that the dlc fixes it and you dont need a mod to do that. The main problem is that it just gets boring kinda fast. Overall (8/10) Perfomance: You read it on the steam page. Not optimized for Windows 7 and newer. This game is BROKEN. You will spend an hour downloading and another two to get it to work not even decently, just to load the game to the main menu without crashing. The game also crashes every 5 to 10 minutes. They should have patched this game to make it work properly, but nope. Overall (5/10) Final verdict: 8/10 If you have $20, I would recommend Fallout New Vegas if you want an RPG experience. I would buy Fallout 3 if you want a huge open world to explore. I would buy Fallout 4 if you want a casualized and dumbed down version of both Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and if you like Borderlands with all of the humor in it taken out. ",

It might be boring at first to walk around, but eventually it becomes rather fun for players, who hate walking simulators.  Decent story, fun and memorable side quests with different endings. Many locations filled with epic unique weapons and lore. And it's DLC's are probably the best expansions I've ever played.  Will be playing this game for many-many upcoming years.  Simply a masterpiece ",
