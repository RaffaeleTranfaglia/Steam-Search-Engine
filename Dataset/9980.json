            "review_text": "Not a lot happens in this game and you can't get hurt or die, but it looks great, and that's good enough for me. There are some environmental type puzzles, although they're not all that challenging - but this game isn't trying to be that in any way. UnderGarden is more about relaxation, exploration, and having something nice to look at on the screen. UnderGarden hasn't crossed that line where it's more 'art' than game; it is definitely still a game, but just don't expect tricky platforming or any enemies. I'm not even sure if you could call it platforming - you just float around making cool glowing stuff grow and weird dudes play music while nobody attacks you and even explosions don't hurt, and eventually you find your way to a portal and then go some place else and do more of the same and maybe you put on a hat. I like this game; 6 out of 10, would propagate.",

            "review_text": "While expecting yet another unimaginative retro 2D platformer, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that, while the game is a 2D scroller, the developers differentiated the game sufficiently for me to not despise it.  3D graphics present the 2D plane in an acceptable way for PC gamers to tolerate, console control schemes aren't forced on you, so the game technology is tolerable.  Gameplay is more esoteric than regular platforming, geared towards puzzle solving rather than timing jumps and dodging turtles. Mechanics involve moving and triggering various plants and 'entities' in the 2D environment, with gravity triggers and so on.  It's probably aimed more at children, it's certainly not heavy on action, etc etc, but that's fine - if you like 2D esoteric platformers, and have young children, this is quite an acceptable choice.",
