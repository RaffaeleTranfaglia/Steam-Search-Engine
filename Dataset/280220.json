            "review_text": "I think Creeper World 3 catches a lot of people off guard because of the cheap price, low resolution graphics and understated appeal. It also gets called a Tower Defense game a lot, which does the unique strategic components a horrible injustice. Instead, Arc Eternal is a laid-back thinking mans' RTS with unprecedented play-more value and excels as a game you can sink some time into in the form of a well thought out and strictly controlled approach, or as a casual attack on a map every now and then. It's like Civilization V in the respect that you'll launch it for a quick 20 minute game and find yourself embroiled in the relentless depths of an alien planet fighting to make a foothold on a section of map on the 4th planet of your 3rd star system 6 hours later, wondering where the time went.  The amount of content in here is staggering, and the campaign provides such a good learning curve and introduction to the new structures and some possible strategies that can't be praised enough. There's also an engaging backstory in the main campaigns which help you feel isolated and alone while fighting the uncaring, unforgiving creep, and while the dialogue is cliche at times, it helps bolster the already engaging gameplay and add a little depth.

            "review_text": "A true indie gem. The tags say this is a tower defense game, but it is really it's own thing. I suppose tower defense is the closest thing to what it is but it is a bit misleading.  So what it is? The premise is you have to fight back the creeper, which behaves pretty much like water pouring out of a spout (or more than one most of the time). It slowly spreads from it's source, and is stopped by walls and higher ground until it fills up the area below and reaches the correct height. To fight this, you build cannons, mortors, flying craft, anti-creeper producers (your beneficial creeper than cancels out the other creeper) and a few other weapons. These are your 'towers' but they are all mobile and can be placed anywhere they fit. To support them you need to produce energy, which comes from nodes that cover the ground and reactors. The nodes link up to others and need to link back to your base to produce energy and supply your troops. Reactors don't need any ground to cover and produce more. Troops out of supply will soon use up there reserves and will no longer be able to use their abilities.  So for gameplay you will slowly spread out over the map, extenting your network and fighting back the creeper until you reach the sources and take them out with special weapons. That's the basics but there is more. There is a scripting language for the maps that lets them bend the rules. There is one, non-story level where you control a man through a maze who shoots and finds keys for instance. To top it all off, there are literally thousands of maps (most likely, I didn't count). The main story is only a very small part of the game. After completing parts of it other areas open up, which are basically user created maps, beta testing maps and challenging maps. If you like the game enough you could spend thousands of hours on it, I'm sure. I was content with just the main story and a few other maps though.  If this looks at all interesting to you, do yourself a favor and pick it up. It isn't even expensive.",

I'd say it plays like a slower style RTS like Supreme Commander, mixed with tower defence. However, there is a strong online competetive speed running intention behind this game. Best of both worlds kind of thing I guess. You can make and share your own maps. Play and complete on other people maps. I love how little download wait time there is between trying new maps. Literally, a few seconds.  The down sides, I'm not a huge fan of the artwork. I find it corny and unpleasnt looking. Nonetheless, it works somehow in this setting. There is also a lack of diversity, variation, and depth, with the units and enemies. Each unit has it's strict purpose like in a tower defence game. The outcome can become rather predictable and static. But don't let that stop you from trying this game! It's really fun.",

Admittedly the game isn't really pretty and might put some people off, but gameplay-wise this is a gem.  I mean... how many games do you know where the main mechanics are attrition, network building and logistics?  At the start of the game I completely disregarded the story, but I quickly found myself wanting to know more... and the story is actually well-written and interesting! Which, I have to say, was a surprise (the game would have been as good without any story whatsoever).  Also, the pacing is great... every level holds a new mechanic, a new unit or a new obstacle to overcome.  The content is also monstrously gigantic, with custom maps, challenges, etc.  Now, not everything is perfect... the instructions on how to play are way too vague and the lack of tooltips coupled with odd terminology makes it a bit hard to get into. The UI is functional but could have been better. Also, people who might panic when there's too much much stuff going on might not like it...  Despite all of this, it's still a fantastic experience and real surprise... especially considering that nowadays games tend to fail to hold my interest for more than a couple of hours.

Everything comes down to building networks of weapons, shields, and other devices to slowly push forward against the rising tide. Full map terraforming, a wide variety of weapons and upgrades, movable towers, artillery, shields, and aircraft are all tools at your disposal. The story campaign has a wide and clever variety of mission types and goals, and an interesting 'big idea' sci-fi story line reminiscent of Arther C. Clarke is the icing on the cake here. The random mission generator, huge variety of additional non-story missions, and sizable community map selection ensure you'll never run out of new challenges. A generally slow pace, as well as full pause-and-issue functionality, ensures that you can play as methodically as you like. Fair warning, there is one timed mission in the campaign (Farbor), but after a replay or two you'll be able to beat the 35 minute timer without too much difficulty. Being smart is always vastly more important than being fast in this game.  Any fan of strategy, especially logistics-heavy strategy, would do well to check this one out. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "  Creeper World 3 is quite a unique game, it feels like a tower defense game mixed with real-time-strategy elements.  Like in most other RTS games, you have to build a base, though here it is more like a 'power grid', which is essential to power all your defensive and offensive structures. The main difference here though, is the enemy. Instead of tanks, humans or monsters, you have a lava like liquid, that slowly creeps its way to your base and tries to 'fill' the entire map.  It's called 'The Creeper'. I know, it sounds like the name of a cheap 60s horror movie, but it's not.  Anyways, most of the time you'll build turrets, mortars, jet fighters and bombers to defend yourself from The Creeper. But usually that's not enough. You also have the option to 'terraform' the environment. That way you can either dig trenches, or, which is a lot more effective, raise the terrain to wall off your base.  The whole process is quite a lot of fun, especially when you unlock things like the Bertha, which is a giant cannon, or the Thor, which is a giant spaceship with multiple turrets that rains death from above.  The thing I like the most about Creeper World 3 is that you can play whatever way you like. This might be the slow and defensive way, or the fast and offensive way. This is quite important if you care about getting in the top 10 list of each map. These lists are primarily sorted by how much time it took you to complete the map, though to be honest, you'll have a hard time beating the best times, since they're usually around 20 to 30 seconds for each map. This is especially frustrating because I doubt those times are legit most of the time.  All in all though, Creeper World 3 features a huge amount of content, which is good if you like getting your money worth. It's also bad if you want to 100% this game, because judging by the amount of levels, it might take you hundreds of hours to do so.  There's also the fact that you can make your own maps, and play other players maps right inside the game. This gives Creper World 3 almost infinitive content, though some player created levels might be too easy, or even impossible to beat.  Conclusion: Amazing game with an enormous amount of re-playability, easily worth the full price if you're a fan of tower-defense/RTS type of games.",

It's an interesting strategy, where you don't fight against enemy units similar to yours, but massive amounts of creeping blue goo. So it feels a little bit like tower defence, but really innovative one.  The in-game economy system is quite simmilar to one from Supreme Commander (which I loved too!) and it's based more on flow of the resources than stockpiling them. This approach forces costant action, which is nice.  So, does concept still feels to You boring? Fear not, as so far every single map is quite diverse and suprises me with something new (I've completed about 30% of game, and CW2 which was quite brilliant too!). Your enemy sometimes spawns various units too, and the goo doesn't always act like it's expected to.   The game has its own plot, which is not that plain. There are no cosmic civilisations fighting against each other. There's no war, humanity lost against creeper long ago. You've been asleep for 5 billion years. All you can do is crawling through ruins of ceased race of humans, and try to make sense of what happened. Why do I even mention history in such simple game? Honestly, because at this point I am simply curious how will this story end.  The only 2 downsides I've noticed are: -crappy, plain graphics. I don't think it matters though, as this simpleness comes in one package with perfect gameplay and practical interface. -lack of multiplayer. Seriously, guys, I don't care, add it somehow!  What do I say at the end? Mabye I'll describe my general feel about it. This game feels like the best flash game ever, but with large campagin and saving and stuff. Buy it. Do it.

            "review_text": "Creeper World is a tower defense with very unique gameplay and design. Unlike most tower defense games your enemy isn't a horde of monsters, but is instead a steadily expanding mass known as 'creeper'. Defeating the creeper isn't as simple as having strong towers - you have to know how to hold back the creeper while expanding your own area of influence, taking into account the the creeper will ooze in from multiple angles and will build up in areas of low elevation to eventually climb up onto higher ground.   Your own building mechanics are quite interesting as well. Instead of having independent towers, you instead build a web-like network of resource gatherers, utility structures, and attacking towers. Managing this web can get quite tricky at times, because all resources must flow through a command center and take time to traverse the network. Done incorrectly you could end up building a tower but not being able to arm it in time to defend against the creeper.   Also, while the creeper acts as a steadily growing mass, the player often ends up mirroring the creeper in many ways. Collectors - the primary resource generator - are most effective when spread out, forcing the player to expand their area of influence if they want more resources to spend. There are also many resource deposits around the map which must be contested, forcing the player to expand their area of influence even more. Aiding this playstyle is the fact that attacking towers can be respositioned, allowing you to leapfrog towers to slowly but steadily push the creeper back.  Overall the game is an excellent example of a unique twist on a genre and very polished gameplay. It's an extremely satisfying game to play and I highly recommend it to anyone who finds the concept interesting. Don't worry about not playing the previous games - they give more of the story, but this game is fully functional as a standalone experience.",

The gradual tech and story progression with each - sometimes long, sometimes difficult - mission, adapting to and overcoming the new challenge, is just very enjoyable for me.   Now that I finished the campaign, though, I feel I have only scratched the game's surface. With all the user-created maps, and extra map packs the game provides, I am already returning for more challenges.  A criticism I'm reading in the negative reviews is how the game is the same grind all over again. Building up basic macro and defenses, and then progressing with micro as you upgrade your tech. For a game where every map is different, leaving a wide array of viable strategies and tactics to the player, I find this a very bad point. The SupCom-esque resource system, the focus on map control and relentless assault make this game very interesting, and even the initial 'always repeated' steps come in a personal flavor and depend on the map.   The graphics may look abstract and weird in the screenshots, but they quickly make sense when playing the game. The terrain layers are also very consistent. And honestly, I found a salvo of Bertha shots' dispersed Creeper very satisfying to watch. There's few things like it.  If you're interested, watch some gameplay videos or just wait for a decent sale. I got it at -90% so sales do get decent! There's little room for disappointment at that price, and maybe it will cause you yourself to write a positive review in time.",

It flows downhill, it pools in low areas, and it can't cross high terrain without building up behind it and overflowing it like a dam. This is the key to the game. Work out where the creeper will flow, and divert or destroy it to survive and achieve your objectives.  The game is one of thoughtful management. Rarely is there urgency, except during scripted missions, or if you seriously mess up and end up watching a purple tidal wave swamp your low-lying energy collectors. That's okay!

You place down a main station and place collecters around and then you have to connect cannons to those. But rather than just placing down towers and having them work immediately, they need to first be built and have to be connected to the main station by wires. Then there's also the enemies. 'enemies'. By enemies of course I mean evil water called the Creeper. It gradually spreads around and you use the cannons to push it back (this is as far as ive gotten in the game, there's more enemies and towers later on). Overall the game is really good. It tries something new for a tower defense and does it really well. While I do prefer the standard kind of tower defense, Creeper World 3's unique take on them is really fun and brings more to the genre, and it's cheaper than it deserves to be. I highly recommend you atleast try the game.",

Get to the point you can build two power structures at once, build a few sets of two. Construct a laser and mortar, click 'stop resupply' and when they're built - figure out which one you need first - click 'disarm' and then 'resupply' and then do the same for the second weapon. Construct a third weapon, your choice, I prefer mortars over lasers 4/1 so I'd make two mortars.  The trick with mortars and your power supply is, they recharge faster than they fire. So you can pinch off their supply, use it to construct and power other buildings, and stop them - then resupply the mortars more quickly than over-loading your entire power supply would. By playing 'half-court' with the power supply, I have been able to greatly improve my speed. Some levels that I've thought were impossible, I've re-visited and been able to beat; some are still impossible.  Some cheats must exist because of high scores. High scores mean nothing though. You play, you win and lose, you have fun, you get frustrated, you leave, you come back and figure out a new layout or move on. It's a good game.

Heck, the water moves in a really non-aggressive way like waves lapping at the shore. If you want a game with AI that adpats to your playstyle, look elsewhere.  The most stressful time in any given match is the first few minutes when you're building your base up. I've hit restart numerous times because of acting too slow (mostly since I'm watching TV at the same time); however, once you're up and running defeating creeper is not really about strategy or skills, it's more like a waiting game. You'll be slowly grinding out the time of waiting for buildings to construct or moving your buildings around. The only way this game is interesting is that it allows speed players to post their completion times for everyone to see.  While I do fawn over pixel art, Creeper World is very dated even for pixel graphics. There are loads more mobile games that look better than this. I will say that the strongest aspect of the aesthetic is the soundtrack. I never felt bored with the music and it gives this emergency type of rock background in the environment.

            "review_text": "This is a gem of a strategy game. It's a RTS Tower defense-esque game, this might not sound like a good idea, but it works beautifully. There are two main mechanics that I will address:  1. The Creeper. This is your enemy, it's a liquid entity that creeps forward from spawners, slowly covering more and more of the stage. You need to build towers to fight it back, and in turn advance farther along the stage yourself. Creeper would be very difficult to deal with if it didn't obey the laws of physics. Basically, in order for creeper to overflow onto a higher level of terrain, it has to have nowhere else to go on its current level. This leads to some fairly interesting placements, like a very powerful spawner at the bottom of a deep crater. There are plenty of other enemies too, runners and digitalis namely. Runners just run along digitalis and need to be destroyed with sniper towers, they can't directly destroy your towers, but can stun them long enough for creeper to overflow onto them. Digitalis is a kind of grid-like enemy that conducts creeper and prevents towers from being built, trust me, it's more difficult than it sounds.  2. The Network. This game has parallels to a tower defense game, but calling it one doesn't do it justice. The biggest conventional differences being: Towers are networked, they have to be connected to your base to function; Towers can be moved freely, even off the network, albeit with limited ammo; towers use energy, constantly.  The biggest difference as I stated is the network. You have to build collectors and relays between towers to provide pathways for the 'packets' of which there are three types, ammo, construction, and totem. This means you can't just build towers in the most strategic spots right away, you have to build out to them, often fighting tooth and nail to get to them. Additionally, these packets cost energy, which is distributed evenly between the active types of packets, energy is obtained through collectors, which collect energy across an area, and reactors. Collectors gain no benefit from overlapping area and should be spread out, they are also one of the main staples in your network of towers. If you get too ambitious with your expansion, you'll enter energy starvation, where packets are produced less efficiently and you run the risk of your blasters running out of ammo and the line being pushed back.  Between the campaign mode and the hundreds of other levels in the game + fan made ones, you could get hundreds of hours out of this game (I didn't because I just played creeper world 1 and 2 before it and was done after the campaign). Having played all three games, this is the best.   Even at full price, I think you'll get your money's worth, this is a difficult game, you will need to think strategically and act quickly. It's a refreshing change of pace from most RTS and tower defense games in my opinion.",

You think you will sit down for a few minutes to beat a mission, and it'll end up being 6 hours long. But it's not the kind of 'OH GOD MAKE IT END', it's the kind of 'Wow, I wish I could experience that again.' The beginning missions start out easy, and the difficulty curve steadily increases, until you will be punished for turtling, or not being offensive enough. It is a beautifully crafted game which you absolutely have to try.   It comes with ridiculous amounts of content, endless replayability, and hours of fun. It is truly a 10/10 game. I cannot recommend this enough.",

You have to set a perimeter using your resources the best you can and then kill the creeper back. Once you set your perimeter you have a guaranteed win. Its just a matter of patience. The game play is what gets this game such high score reviews, so im not sure this is a bad thing per se.

BUT Still the creeper does evolve and did really somehow overwhelm and whip out the humanity again. So the rest is your to discover.",

Gameplay consists of slowly advancing your line of towers, inch-by-inch, as you attempt to hold back the (literal) enemy wave. It may get a bit dull eventually since the enemy does not build-up more advanced tech within a single level (although they do over the course of the campaign). I've found that it's great to have open in another window while listening to music or a livestream.",

Creeper World 3 is a base building tower defense with deep strategy and extra mechanics to keep things interesting.  You, the player, Vs. The creeper - A growing, organic, hive fluid that spreads across terrain consumning all in it's path.  Cannons, mortars, snipers, big berthas and more!!  Are all at your disposal to keep back, and annhilate the creeper and it's tools!!  Every mission is different, every map is unique, and there are thousands if not millions of player created maps in addition to the tutorial, campaign, and different sectors.   If you enjoy tower defense, a bit of micromanagement, strategy, an adaptive enemy, and so much content that you'll be happy for weeks, hell, even if you enjoy factorio, you'll probably enjoy this game just as much as me. It's what I searched for in a game for a very long time, and now that I have it, I am playing it as much as I can, and loving every second.   10/10",

However if gameplay and mechanics are important, (like they are for me,) this is a great strategy game.  The campaign will take you a few days to get through (depending on how much time you devote to it each day.) However, there is so much content available through additional 'official' scenarios and fan made maps (there is an editor) that you will not have time to ever look at all of them, let alone play them all. (and most that I have played are quite good.)  Right now, the spiritual successor, Particle Fleet: Emergence is also available on steam. While having similar concepts there are plenty of differences. I would suggest getting both. Both games are very good in their own right, if you like one, you will like the other... and different enough to justify having both.",
