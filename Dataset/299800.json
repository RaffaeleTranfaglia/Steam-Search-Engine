            "review_text": "The Land of Eyas is a really polished, gravity based 2D puzzle - platformer.  The lore is hidden between the levels and you need to explore the land to understand the story, which is the best way of telling the story to the player.  The art style is great with a really well made soundtrack.   Game is based on 'choose your own level to contiune' and has an ability which most of the 2D platformers lacking, climbing!   It also has 'timer' feature and all levels has a 'time goal' to beat. I might try to speedrun this game at some point.  If you are fan of the platformer genre, you will definetly like this game. I fully recommend it.",
