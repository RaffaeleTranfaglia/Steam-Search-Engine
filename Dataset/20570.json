This game's campaign, though admittedly rather short, was an amazing and engaging ride through and through. The corruption mechanic allows high replayability as there are several ways the campaign itself can go, and thus, several endings, but also the missions are quite well crafted and varied. It ties in perfectly with the vanilla game's single player story as you guide the Blood Ravens into, or away from the allure of Chaos. And although Dawn of War II's campaign was interesting, it didn't wow me nearly as much as Chaos Rising's did, so much that I now strongly recommend playing both in order. Keeping your former squadmates is a nice touch, for continuity's sake.  It turned me into a fan of 40k. I want and crave more now. If you're into the unique squad based gameplay, please get Chaos Rising, it's frankly a must have expansion.",

It's heresy not to play this game if you're into Warhammer (or it's heresy to play this game, if you're a Chaos player like me - whatever gets you to play it).  The core campaign was great, and the Chaos Rising expansion has added a lot to enrich it (while making one incredibly frustrating change to the way you resupply in battle). I haven't even touched the additional modes and I can say this is a great purchase for any WH40k fan, or for a lot of RTS players.  One caveat, though - you can buy Dawn of War II: Retribution and get all the content from the core and Chaos Rising, but I can't recommend it personally, as it won't run on my computer for some reason. There's been some funny business as these games are migrated from Games For Windows servers to Steam, and that's probably the problem, but as it is I only know Chaos Rising as a safe bet.",

The universe is properly realized in this game, so if you are a fan you will be happy with the level of detail and how the game stays true to the source material.   Gameplay is engaging, easy to start, hard to master in the single player, the multiplayer is alot of fun and but if you are playing someone experienced you can easily get wiped out very quickly.   Overall I would recommend the game for people who are fans of the warhammer 40k games/universe or people who are interesting in squad based tactical games. The powers that the Heroes have can really add an extra element.",

Its good only for 2v2 and 3v3 and that's what most players of this game play. Its well suited for Faction war meaning all 3 heroes of the same faction together in the same team fighting all the 3 heroes of another faction. Playing the game like that its real fun so for i recommend real life friends to get it as this is how i started this game. Dont get the game if you are to play it solo you wont have fun. It would be great if its campaign had 4 player cooperate instead of 2 so that's a big deal negative, if there is a patch that makes coop campaign for 4 players that would be great. In general i only recommend to get this game if you have a real life premade team lets say or you plan to play it with online friends, its good for that. Its a minimized CoH 1 but its not Warhammer game. If yougonna play multiplayer DoW 2 Retribution then you MUST get Elite mod, if makes the game real good and balanced. The modding team even fixed bugs retail has. The single player sadly has no 4 player coop mode but 2 which is very bad. DoW 2 Retribution is poorly made mini CoH 1 and has nothing to do with Warhammer 40K. DoW 1 mods are WAY BETTER and are 40K SOLID. To a casual gamer i recommend this game, to someone who wants 40K no i dont. This is a review for both DoW 2 and DoW 2 Retribution. ****VERY IMPORTANT**** Base turrests broke mmultiplayer.",

Anyway back to the game, if you don't like MMOs like World of Warcraft, but enjoy startergey games like me. Then this game will not dissapoint you. With a well structured online system, campaign and horde mode this game is crafted perfectly by deveopers who care about the players and not just the money *Cough* EA!.  Along with the campagin and horde mode, it has the element of loot or geat, and also leveling up and choosing stats, to improve you squad and seperate charecters to make your gamplay suit you. Overall if your looking for a good startergy game with some fancy graphics and enjoyable gamepay, gamemodes and just a great game overall. I am sure you will not be disspointed with this purchase.",

The campaign works a little differently than in DOW II and you can advance up to level 30. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot. Still, I would have liked to have buildings or to be able to field more units at a time, as in DOW I.",

Don't go into this game expecting a certain kind of strategy game, like the previous DoW, or you will be disapointed. Instead, appreciate how unique it is.

If they engineered it so that you wouldn't be able to tell what equipment is tainted and maybe the character would get possessed by it making him reluctant to take it off or have some form of withdrawal when you do figure out why your assault squad is going mental then this would have been superb.

Get Tarkus moving in to provide support in clearing them out, and have Avitus put them on a rout or grind them down into the dirt whence they came from.  Same formula as before, sure, but with more toys and mechanics. I'd say, if you're looking for glorious Space Marine action, this is still the go-to-game: play the original campaign, and then play Chaos Rising. Retribution doesn't even come close, and I have doubts about DoW III's campaign just as much.",
