            "review_text": "Fantastic little word game, which can be described as a scrabble-meets-RPG (or to be more precise: monster mashing in a fantasy setting with basic cRPG elements, if you like).  As in original scrabble, you are building words from letter tiles, but instead of accumulating points, you are using them to defeat your opponents. There is loot, potions, various unlockables, character development and... yes, there are quests! (scrabble-like, mainly about building specific number of words meeting specific criteria).  The game has a high replay value (it's a word game, after all), and after beating Story Mode (there is little story about it, actually - rather a sequence of challenges), there is so-called 'Endless Mode', where it's just you, monsters, and the question - how long can you survive?  Production value is high as well - it's a casual game, but a very polished one. Cartoonish presentation adds a lot of charm - it's cute, colorful and clean. Ingame music is diverse and works really well; it didn't force me to turn it off, and I was playing for hours.  I would recommend this, if you find tradidional word games boring, but like the idea of word-building game with defined goals and/or light cRPG flavor. Well, even if you don't, it's still worth trying.  Pros:  + high replay value with Story Mode and Endless Mode + graphics and decent music (and high production value overall) + achievements very well balanced - manageable, but giving you a nice feeling of progession.  Cons:  None. This is pretty much perfect for what it is.",

I love this game, I bought it for the xbox one originally soon after it launched on there and added it to my steam account after it was on sale for a silly price. If you love word games and rpg's then this is enough to satisfy for the full price in my opinion.  Negatives are few and far between, difficulty is curved with upgrades primarily but there are the odd times that you can't find a word for love nor money due to some of the monster's abilities. Monster design while nicely drawn is lacking variation but that's not really what I come back for.  I would definitly recommend this title, myself and parter have been playing seperatly and together for months :)",

            "review_text": "Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey is a fun little word game where the object of the game is to defeat monsters by creating words. The game in itself is sort of like a mobile game, but its something that I would play when I'm bored and only have a little time to play games. Letter Quest is not extremely easy and has semi RPG elements in it such as upgrades and increases in certain things that make going on easier. Another thing is that the monsters can make the tiles have different negative effects which really affects your damage sometimes. Some of the challenge monsters or bosses even have certain conditions that you have to fullfill to beat them, such as 'words with double letters do quadruple damage' and that kind of stuff. A lot of Letter Quest actaully took me a lot of tries to beat and there are some levels where I haven't completed all challenges yet and probably won't ever. Overall, fun little game but don't buy it for full price unless you really like games like this.  Rating: 7.7/10",

            "review_text": "I'm not sure what was the point of switching to Unity for this game. The Flash platform can be conveniently replaced with the OpenFL + Haxe environment, would have saved the author a lot of time. Anyway, I'll take this as a training exercise for future Unity games, right?  The Remastered version adds a new optional soundtrack, which is pretty good but a far cry from the magnificence of the original's soundtrack. Seriously, when you have talent like this, you credit them, instead of pushing them to the side. It's still easily the best indie soundtrack I've heard since the days of Shatter and VVVVV.  There's also the endless mode. I tried it once, and found it stressful. I play LQ for relaxation, so it's a no-go for me. Maybe it's possible to save between battles and not have to do it all in a single session, I'm not sure. I'll have to play it again in the future though, since I'd like to 100% this game's achievements for once. I got my 40th star in expert mode a couple of days after the game's release, must have been one of the first. I greatly enjoyed the difficulty curve; perhaps because I'd already finished it twice in normal mode.  LQ, whether in normal or remastered mode, is more polished than the earlier (and unrelated) 'Bookworm' games, which LQ shamelessly borrowed from. Then again, it's fair game when you're taking from a company (PopCap) that made its fortune on Bejeweled, which was itself heavily inspired by a lesser known game...  Do whatever you want, but play this game. Unless of course you don't want to. In which case, why are you even reading this review? You should get some help.",

If you like word games, I'd say get it, even though it's $8. It has enough polish to be worth it, I think. If you've played Letter Quest before, I'd still say get it.",

I appreciate being able to play one quick 3 minutes game, say for example, try to get a timed star on a level, or play for longer sessions as it does not seem to get boring.  Finding a highly damaging word on a boss stage when your health is low is a rather rewarding experience, something that I have rarely experienced in a word puzzle turn by turn game ! The game adds a lot of variety using special tiles/encounters which has kept it nicely fresh so far (Sure we will all spam 'QUEEF' or 'POOPED' at some point, but that's only for uh damage value...)  I would compare it very favorably against Bookworm adventures, better design, and more fun in general. ",

With so many word games out there, it's hard to find one that shines brighter than the rest, but Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey Remasted does so brilliantly. The visuals are appealing, the music is nostalgic, and the drive to complete your goals is always there. An 'Endless' mode is there to satiate your letter crunching once you've completed the meat of the game and does invite additional challenges or competition between friends, if you're old enough to remember when high scores mattered.  It's certainly not without flaw and admittedly, the last several hours I logged were simply achievement grinding with little emotional investment. The second half of the quest mode becomes a breeze with the appropriate upgrades, but by then you probably don't care because you're working to tick off another achievement. (Assuming you're as compulsive about that sort of thing as I am.)  On sale or not, I highly recommend this game. If you were interested enough to finish this review, it's exceptionally unlikely this game will disappoint you.",

            "review_text": "Letter Quest is a game that you spell words and kill things. Like those flash games none of those kids play, but this is no ordinary letter game. The game has you playing as Grimm, the owner of a mansion and a hunger for pizza. But, that will all change when he sees the hell, that he has to go through. This game, will accept pretty much any word in the english dictionary, except for words like, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, and hideandgoseek. The game introduces new mechanics along your adventure, most of them editing the tiles functionallity. The difficulty however, is insane, at least for it was. First world is easy, but when you reach to that graveyard, you are on your own from there. The difficulty spike is the height of Mount Everest, its so hard, I had an easier time playing Super Meat Boy then this game. Not to say this game is bad, its actually quite good. But some parts feel impossible, so here is a word to make things easier.  1. quai: quai is a word that you are going to need, as if you have the right stuff, you can do a whopping 134 damage.  I however love the music, too bad there isn't really anyway to listen to it other than playing the game. Endless mode is a really nice feature, but maybe could need some tweaking to keep some players interested in it. Speaking of interested, there is little to no replay value, when I finished the final level, I didn't really want to do the other missions. I love the steam trading cards by the way, they look nice, and the badges do too.      The ending however, was, not good, I wish there could of been something cool, like noticing that he saved the world, or the lair exploding. But instead we get a picture of him eating pizza. Lovely, just, just lovely.   The story is just him trying to get some pizza. When in reality, he could just get in the car and go Pizza Hut or Domino's.  What would I give this game?  8/10  Story isn't good, but the gameplay is really nice and would like to see a sequal with a better story.  Totally worth 8 bucks paying for, even better in a steam sale.",

            "review_text": "Letter Quest is basically Scrabble with RPG elements such as quests, upgrades and monsters! Now the concept itself was what enticed me to buy this game in the first place, but when you actually get into the game you start to realise that the game becomes rather dull and repetitive. The quests are relatively easy to complete, but the amount of 'crystals' (the in-game currency) you get per quests are sort of miniscule compared to the amount that you need to even buy one upgrade when you get to higher levels. Each level also gets exponentially more difficult so unless you are a Scrabble genius or have been buying A LOT of upgrades, you wouldn't be able to pass the level, which just sort of turns this game into a grind hell.  Although in saying that, I haven't explored the game enough to know if there is some sort of mind-blowing story or a very rewarding experience waiting for me at the end. I'll update this review when I have progressed further into the game, though for now I can't really give this game my recommendation for the torturous first few hours I am experiencing.",
