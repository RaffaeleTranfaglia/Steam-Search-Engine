            "review_text": "s great. One of the last Best CoD's you can get. Complaints 1. The price... $40 for almost a 5 year old game?! 2. Connection issues: since it is a 5 year old game, the servers are starting to come down and have tons of problems with the connections.. 3.Can't play SOLO without a connection: When I want to try and get the high level of zombies I cannot because TreyArch makes the game *Always online*. Now just to be clear when you are on the STEAM page. It does not say anywhere that you MUST have an on-going connection to play the game.  Postive comments 1. Great community: I have never played with a CoD community who are 'mature' than kids on the digusting consoles. Never really any complaints but if somebody did wine the server would tell you to 'Stfu' xD 2. Create a Class: It's not bad consider you can buy ANY of the equiment you want instead of unlocking all by killing everybody, plus they are some great snipers and assualt rifles.  Do I reccomend this game? Yes and no. The reason I am keeping it as a negetive is the price and the server issues. I mean think about it? Advanced Warfare is about $60USDs and this game is about 40USDs. Not worth it completely because it is a 5 YEAR OLD GAME TreyArch. But anyways I would say about a 5/10 because online is good, once you get it to work, but again, this price needs to be lowered to $20USD instead of this price.   Thanks for reading...",

            "review_text": "Now this game is a great game, even if it is old and because it has multiple modes I will make different sections for each one.  Singleplayer: The Story in this game was very unique and catching. I enjoyed it alot more than any other story of any other Call of Duty. The Controls where easy and the voice acting was great! The only annoying thing was that the default fov is 65. But if you look around on the internet you will find a guide that helps you changing it into 90. The Most annoying thing by far was that for some reason it didn't read my save file proper and after restarting the game I had to restart also the story. But after all the problems have been fixed I could enjoy the singleplayer like no other. It was worth going through that as I really felt some of the characters growing to my heart!  Zombiemode: The Zombiemode in this game is alot different from the second, it is harder and also in my opinion alot scarier than Number 2. If you happen to play on your own you can have 90 fov but as soon as you play online and/or with your friends it will stay on 65 fov. Which I find personally annoying. But it is still a good game mode to play in singleplayer mode. It is alot of fun.  Multiplayer: Unlike other Call of Dutys this game has an actual Serverbrowser where you can search for a server of any kind to join. Most of them do not have any admins anymore but it is still alot of fun to play on them. In the Multiplayer mode you can change and keep your FOV from 65 up to 90.   All in all this game is amazing, the graphics are still good looking and I had no problems running it on the highest setting. Although there is one thing I would like to mention. If you are german you will get the cut version because of Nazis and the Hackenkreuz. I do not know how much they cut out but I am pretty sure it must have been quiet a bit. I recommend you getting this game uncut from a key website. You will have the same fun as anybody else for a cheaper price!  Which is one of my last points. This game has a great singleplayer, story and zombie mode. But for the fact on how old this game is and that hardly anybody still plays the multiplayer (compared to more newer cods anyways) I recommend to get this game on sale.",

(I needed a break lol, i have migraine)  TL;DR -  BUY IT, but not from Steam. You can get this game around 4 Euros from 3rd party sellers. If you're not from Germany, you can find it as 'Uncut Edition'. Steam price is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's a 6 years old game and Activision should stop raising this game's price because the third game has released. Yes, i see what you did there, Activision, you doubled the price last year.   &lt;end of TL;DR&gt;  I started playing CoD with CoD 2. That was a masterpiece, and if we' think about WW2 games, it still is. And then i played MW series. They were epic, too. But none of them was like BO. Black Ops was the Cod that i'm looking for. Second mp Cod i played was BO2 and it was 'meh' for me. you know, if i want to play sci-fi shooter, i'd go and play Titanfall. (And yes, i did play Titanfall)  Black Ops has minimal camper count, because it doesn't have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t high-tech overpowered scorestreaks. Yes, some of them are overpowered, but it's playable.  Black Ops does not have too much 12 yo kids who wants to ♥♥♥♥ your mom, because it doesnt have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t high-tech overpowered scorestreaks and weapons. Oh, same sentence, is it coincidence? Think not.   Besides MW2 (i heard it has lots of cheats &amp; hacks and stuff) this is currently the best Multiplayer Call Of Duty you can play without dying of cancer. Also, Black Ops 1's Scenario is my personal favorite. It's classic Call Of Duty 'interactive movie' scenario, but it has epic mind♥♥♥♥s and good drama. You'll love it.  Worth buying? - I answered that question at TL;DR part Still alive mp? - April 30th, 2016, yes, very active servers. Cheat? - Like in every mp game, but it's avoidable. Singleplayer? -Masterpiece Multiplayer? -♥♥♥♥ing enjoyable  Do i need that game to understand BO2? -Not actually, But yes, it'll be better because the reason why second game's scenario is good is first game's scenario.  Spoiler: Remember the day you've watched Fight Club. Where was your mind? Definetely.  And don't forget those steps, they will lead you out of Vorkuta. 1.Secure the keys. 2.Ascend from darkness. 3.Rain fire. 4.Unleash the horde. 5.Skewer the winged beast. 6.Wield a fist of iron. 7.Raise Hell. 8.Freedom.",

(That's a thing) I even own my Own Ballistic Knife server and the Best Ballistic Knife clan as well. That wouldn't have been an option, if I didn't love this game so much.  I recommend this Game, because it has many cool features... Server's with Only Sniping and Knifing. So cool! :) It's quite cheap as well, so go a head! The different animations are Amazing and realistic. Definitely could have been done better, but considdering, that this Game is from 2010, is just Mind Blowing! :) Thanks for the Game, many hours of Happiness.",

            "review_text": "One of the most classic CoDs out there and one of the last good ones too. I remember playing this game on the 360 the year it came out and enjoyed the multiplayer and zombies, although as time progressed I ended up forgetting about it and sold my 360. I recently decided to buy it again for the PC off of another website for about $10 since it's still overly expensive on steam and these are my thoughts on it:   CAMPAIGN   Since I never got to finishing the campaign on the Xbox I decided to play it again and actually finished it. Graphics are still pretty impressive for a 5 year old game. The campaign provided amazingly fun gameplay and a very engaging story that kept me playing until the end; I was also really surprised by how intriguing the story was and it was definitely worth the play time I put into completing it. I'm sure a lot of people new to the game will enjoy it as much as I did.    MULTIPLAYER   Multiplayer is enjoyable, although to some it may look like it's just been completely dominated by hardcore game modes which some people might find out of their comfort zone, although softcore game modes still exist it just takes a bit of searching for. Most of the community is mature since most of the CoD kiddies are found on console so no need to worry about 9 year olds screaming into their turtlebeaches.   ZOMBIES   The Zombies game mode is still very enjoyable especially with others and surprisingly it's not that hard to find an online lobby(for me at least). You can also play with your friends which I strongly recommend doing unless you're hardcore and like going solo. If you plan on buying this for the zombies you should also pick up the Rezzurection DLC since they only really give you 3 zombies maps in the base game which can get boring after awhile for some people.  Overall I'd give this game a 9/10 and it was worth the amount I paid. I'd recommend this to any fan of the classic CoDs such as CoD4, WaW etc. or anyone who is a fan of FPS games and/or shooting zombies.",

MW2 has people who cheat for their entire side (meaning everyone on one faction gets everything unlocked and gets super powers) which sometimes shows up as a hack even though you didn't do it.  8/10",

If you're really into the Vietnam and Cold Wars, this could be an ideal game for you but if you're not into Call of Duty, I don't blame you because I prefer the older ones myself. Call of Duty 4 up to Modern Warfare 3 was pretty much the bomb at the time.  However the only thing I would recommend you do if you plan on buying this game is to buy a cheaper steam key on eBay or something or wait until the game becomes at least half-price (like I did, as I bought the game during the 2014 summer sale) as the game isn't worth as much as £30, despite that the game is now almost 4 years old already.",

The zombie mode on this one leaves a lot to be desired, but then again I'm not into fighting endless hordes  until I drop or quit out of boredom. I like acheiving a goal at the end and leaving with a sense of triumph, which I use to get from playing LFD 1 and 2.  The graphics and the cutscenes are superb but obviously it takes more than that to make a game worth playing. I do think it somewhat better than it's other previous COD games like Modern Warfare 4 (especially this one) and World At War. But still for a game that's well over 3 years old this one should not be going for 40$ any longer. For this reason I cannot seriously recommend it. It's a good game but vastly overrated. ",

            "review_text": "Oh man, I really don't want to do this, but sadly I must give Black Ops a negative review. Mind you I like this game. As a game it's top notch and worth playing. However I'm quite annoyed at the actual PC version of this game.   The problems stem from the fact that there's NO niceties and at least one VERY big flaw. First the opening interface is HORRIBLE on PC. You literally MUST have a keyboard for the game to work. Even a mouse won't allow you to use the menu efficently. So trying to play this game with just a controller is a horrible experience. In addition even though controllers work in game, they don't work well. You can get all the functionality you expect in game, but on the pause menu the controller only works with the pause button. You can't select anything with out a mouse or keyboard.   Even when the controller works in game, it doesn't work out of game, so the main menu still doesn't work, and will require a keyboard and a mouse if you are ever use big picture mode.   That isn't a big problem, however the interface all over feels like a interface from 2005, even in a 2010 game this is outdated, but again I could live with this.   However there's two major issues I have. First the game does try to cloud save something but does a horrible job of it (nothing is stored in the cloud) but the worse problem is if you somehow run out of memory as you play the game (not impossible) the game will actually delete your save data. I ended up losing my entire progress because of this when nearing the end of the game, a second time.   I mean seriously? I had a save game that was quite far, and then there was a dialog telling me the game was out of memory, and when I quit to fix the problem, my save game was wiped.   Black Ops was one of the best Call of Duty games in years, but I'd recommend a console copy if you want to play it now for the single player. The PC version is ok, but definitely showing it's age. Of course if you want mouse and keyboard you'll have to play on the PC, but that'd be the only reason I'd recommend playing this game,   It's not a bad game, but damn it, the game should be far better than these problems.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game because of the nostalgia of the Multiplayer and the Zombies. I did played the missions back when I used to have it for PlayStation but I don't really like replaying missions. When the game installed I jumped into it and the first thing I did went untoward zombies. The zombies was really good I played for about 20 - 30 minutes with an online group and we eventually lost. After that I decided to go the multiplayer section. Since it was my first time plain this game in a PC I wasn't used to looking for servers manually rather than the PlayStation or Xbox automatically putting me in one. From here is what it was a bit disappointing because There was no servers with normal team dead match , ctf, search and destroy, but rather 5 servers at most with 20+ people in each. And yet in those servers the game modes are not like the original.Once you go into the server it automatically downloads the mod needed to play the game. And it's infected with skins of zombies on top. I mean it's boring and nothing like he original. They're constantly trying to sell you something and you can't even leave in the middle of the game or else you get banned. That's one of the servers another is like a big survival were you play agains bots with other players , I found that one to be the 'best' one out of the bunch. The ones where normal like Tdm or ctf where very strict I mean like people taking the game to seriously. My own teammates where killing and the respawn time was like 25 secs so it was annoying. I got annoyed and killed one of the and I got banned. Maybe I got the wrong class or something but how the hell was I supposed to know. It said team death match So I joined but it turned out to be a strict boring server. Other lobbies/servers weren't any better. I think this game is great and is one of the best Call of Duties , but I think the reason why this game does better in multiplayer in consoles is because there's no custom servers with very strict rules. It's shouldn't be a hustle just to play team death match or Capture the flag.  Also 40 bucks it's a bit much. I was able to get it for 20 because of the steam sale but either way.",

Built on the Modern Warfare 2 engine, Black Ops takes a similar approach to the gameplay style - that is, very different from the older Call of Duty titles - while fixing most of the things that Modern Warfare 2 did wrong, adding a bunch of new things and moving the setting to the Cold War. That is basically it in a nutshell.  Before playing through the campaign for the first time, I was pretty sceptic about it, but needless to say it blew those bad expectations right away pretty quickly. It is packed with action at every single step and tells the story in a way that sucks you in like a high-wattage vacuum cleaner, which really was a pleasant surprise from Treyarch as I was expecting something more along the lines of World at War. I would recommend playing through it if you have not done so yet, it is not going to eat that much of your time since it is, after all, a Call of Duty, and there were quite a few memorable moments to justify it.  As I mentioned earlier, the multiplayer comes with many improvements over Modern Warfare 2. The entire game feels more balanced, requires more skill rather than allowing you to grenade-launch your way to victory, and while the killstreak rewards can feel overpowered at times, it is nowhere as bad as it used to be. There is also an in-game currency system used to purchase guns and custom emblems - I, myself, have not managed to find the actual purpose of it because you still have to level up to actually purchase the items, but it is there nonetheless. And, of course, the returning Zombies mode makes for loads of fun as well.  Overall, it is a good game, and if currently on sale, I would not hesitate buying it.",

Second instance of Nazi Zombies with over 10 maps available and an insane amount of secrets to uncover and techniques to develop.

Story(No Spoilers)  The main character is Alex Mason, a CIA operative during the cold war, and the story centers on his participation in black ops, in an attempt to uncover a Communist plot to destroy the west.    Game Time  It takes about 8-12 hours to complete.   In detail  Probably the most interesting single player campaign in a CoD game so far.   However, Multiplayer and the Zombies didnt fulfil my expectation (i'll explain later)   Pros  + Great storyline in a very interesting era + More atmospheric than any other CoD entry so far + Great voice acting, and nice cutscenes. + New timeframe, new weapons! + Zombie Mode    Cons  - Graphics not satisfying enough, not to mention the fact that some specific settings cause glitches. - Worst multiplayer in a CoD series, from my point of view. A complete failure. Everything is poorly designed, the maps, the weapons-attachments, the killstreaks. It hasn't been a nice experience.   Neutral  *The zombies are fun and Treyarch did a great job implementing this mode into this new series. However, its predecessor was way better.  Concluding, it's not a bad game overall, but since i was completely satisfied by the 1/3 of the game i cant recommend it.  5/10  1. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].   2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.",

For this, it helps that Mason is a CIA operative who can jump from Khe San to Vokuta and wield explosive arrows from crossbows Rambo-style and then switch his trusty M16.  The multiplayer seems good at first but it quickly gets tiresome as most games seem to take place on Nuketown. Overall, it's just not as satisfying as MW2 multiplayer, although that too is flawed.

On the store page it says Co-op and to me that means sit on the couch and play with a friend. Multiplayer Co-op is different, which is what this game should say. There is no split screen. I know people say 'you have a pc you shouldn't expect split screen' but seriously with pc becoming more accessible and now with the steam machines, it's no longer a problem. Most people have their pc hooked up to a tv for movies and things like that I see no reason why we should have a feature removed from the game. Yeah the game is old but they can easily put split screen back in with a patch. And the price...seriously $40?? You have got to be joking...even EA wouldn't do that to us. And trying to play the game is a job on its own! Zombies can never connect to the server. I usually have to restart steam and my pc a few times before it will connect. And, because of no split screen, I had to buy another copy so we could play on my brother's pc. We're both wired and sitting next to each other and we still experience lag in a LAN game.

This used to be one of the top shooters. However, since the game is getting old there is less of a player base, and even less servers to choose from. If you plan on buying this for multi-player you should be wary. Some servers are ran by people that can't stand to lose or have odd rules in place that may hinder your personal play style. If you are quite good at shooters, you risk being banned from the server just for being on top with a questionable score... If I was to buy this game now for multi-player. I wouldn't spend more than $10 just for the fact that server admins can ban you for any reason they choose and there are very few servers.",

However this game left me with mixed feelings.  On the one hand I did like Activision's decision to get creative and wild with the storyline.  On the other hand I didn't like the annoying way in which the story was told.  The fact that throughout the game you are fighting in World War 2, Vietnam and the Cuban Missle crisis makes it all feel scrambled together, and too much to process. And the 'interrogation' cutscenes are simply annoying.  So all in all it's a pretty good game, but Black ops does noticably show the decline in quality of Call of duty games after Modern Warfare 2.",

(Looking at you MW2.)  • Server browser! (Looking at you MW2.)  • A community that is still very much alive after 6 years!  • Fun killstreaks that make you feel like a god, while still being fair. (Chopper gunner lets you rain death down from the skies with a minigun, but can be taken down with a couple of RPGs,  • Zombie mode! The game comes with 2 regular zombie maps: Kino der toten and Five. Along with a special, more arcadey Dead Ops Arcade! (All are unlocked after beating the game, but they can be unlocked with ingame cheats if you don't want to bother with the campaign. While the maps aren't as good as the ones in World at War, they're still some of the best zombie maps of this franchise.  • The soundtrack is great. From lovely chiptune-ish tracks of Dead Ops Arcade to metal (and some rap) in the zombie mode.   • ♥♥♥♥ing options menu.  • A fine number of different game modes. -----------  It's simply a great casual first person shooter.

The gameplay is allright just for me kinda repeatly same i kinda did finish it only because of the story. And Veteran mode was a challenge sometimes annoyed because when running inside building and get 1 shotted. So most of the veteran mode i was just standing behind and wait till my teammates killed everything lol. And there is a zombie mode that was very fun to do (everyone love zombies lol). If you wanna buy this game i would say wait till its for sale its a old game but still a great one. Planning to buy rest of cod games too.",

They did an excellent job. Especially Gary Oldman, who did the voice for Sgt. Viktor Rezov, on the 5th installment of the franchise, Call of Duty: World At War. Excellent storyline with excellent graphics and awesome weapons which add to the incredible realism of the game!  Multiplayer is great, with new matches like Wager Match, Gun Game and more! Designing your own character is another awesome feature they added to the game. You get to make the character look however you want as well as designing your own weapons!  Then of course Nazi Zombies returns in Call of Duty Black Ops! If you liked fighting the undead on CoD 5, you will love the new maps! New characters, weapons, and zombies!!!",

PROS: +One of the best stories in Call of Duty history, with plausible realism. +A great single-player campaign full of intrigue, questions, answers, and glorious setpieces. +Collected intel can be viewed to learn more about the story, as well as provide a prologue and epilogue to the story. +Damn fine score. +Refined multiplayer with a level-cap closer to CoD 4, so less grinding to prestige. +Highly balanced multiplayer. There's maybe one or two over-powered guns. +Customizable emblems! +Bots! (Only for Team Deathmatch and Free for All, though) +Nazi Zombies! +Self-reviving in SP zombies. +New and fun Nazi Zombies maps in some setpieces quite a bit cooler than WaW's locations. +DLC for WaW zombies maps in Black Ops. +Feels similar to MW2 without going over-the-top. +Dedicated servers! +Zork!  CONS: -A number of mediocre to downright terrible maps in multiplayer and zombies (Shangri-La comes to mind). -In multiplayer, those few overpowered guns are nearly everywhere. It's hard to find a game without less than three players using said guns. -Worse graphics than in MW2. -Killstreaks don't count towards further killstreaks. -Multiplayer uses 'CODpoints,' a currency used to buy everything you want to unlock, even if you have the level cap for it. So you won't be able to feasably build a half-decent custom emblem until the late part of multiplayer.  A really fine game, and a welcome addition to the Call of Duty lineup.",

Again, the laptop I use may not be the best of the best, but I think it has the capability to run the game at LEAST in 50 frames. Another thing that sucks is the servers. There are like 5 servers that are good and have a great map rotation, and then there's the ridiculous hardcore 'crouch only' servers, and Nuketown 24/7 servers.   In the end though, you can reduce lag with tutorials on the internet. I have found that one video that helped me get up to 50 frames. Definitely recommend this. It's got great guns and maps. Although the game has not very good optimization and servers, it's got amazing multiplayer and freakin' zombies, and who doesn't like zombies amirite? Buy this game, idk how you can sit through this whole review, but thanks for reading! LittleDuckDuck",
