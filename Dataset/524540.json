    "description": "Samurai of Hyuga is a brutal, heart-pounding interactive tale. Prepare to enter the land of silk and steel, where fantasy clashes against grim reality, and where the good guys don't always win in the end. It's a harsh world with tough choices at every turn. Good thing you're the toughest ronin around.",

That said It's very frustrating to know when you make a choice that you shouldn't have made. Perhaps that above all things is my biggest complaint. You can enjoy the story but you truly feel the impact of your choice more so if you made the wrong one.   It's easy to say there are no right or wrong answers however that is not what this game gives you the feeling of. You make a wrong choice and you are going to realize it very quickly. I intend to play the game again and hope that I can get into a better flow of things, for now this is my review and it's a positive one, but with reserved concern",
