            "review_text": "The game is pretty good, at this price it's definitely giving a try if you like scrolling shooters.  It is a huge ripoff of Cave games, it's up to you to decide if that's a bad or a good thing, but you'll be able to tell right away that you've fought every single one of these enemies before. Except for the bosses, those are original as far as I can tell. Coincidentally the bosses aren't all that great.  For difficulty, I only played a few credits so far and haven't beaten it, but I'm under the impression veteran players would consider it too easy. Can't say I've had that problem before.  Scoring is pretty simple, you shoot stuff with the shot, when they turn black you finish them off with the laser, they call this soul drain and it gives you a set bonus per enemy. There's an audio cue when the enemy turns black and they will still have a good chunk of health left at this point, so it's not necessary to memorize how long it takes to kill each enemy like you would on ESP Ra.De. or Ketsui, it's a lot more lenient. There's also a 2x bonus for killing bosses on the last 2 seconds of the timer, point pickups hidden around the stages, and bullet grazing. Save for bullet grazing which is more fluid, all of these are very discrete mechanics, you either get the bonuses or you don't, and it's not all that hard to soul drain every enemy in the stage. I imagine it's very possible that a good player could with enough practice come very close to the theoretical max score of the game, which is weird.  Anyway, it probably won't keep you interested for years but it's a good game. I've never heard of 1CC Games but I hope they make some more.",
