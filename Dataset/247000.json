This game is exceptional when it comes to reviews - it's not actually a video game as such, but a digitalized board game. So, you'll find that the majority of negative reviews are from people who don't like Talisman. Well duh. That's not to say all negative reviews are irrellevant. You just can't trust the meta score for a title like this and people playing a game they already know they'll hate makes for some pretty biased reviews. The Steam ratings and reviews are generally more reasonable, though you do still see this happening.  So, are you new to Talisman? New to board games in general? No problem, simple way to see if you might enjoy it. Youtube. Go watch gameplay of the actual board game and/or the digital version. If you find yourself wanting to take one of the seats and play - then this game is for you. If it looks boring and you lose interest fast (as many people do with board games) then look elsewhere. Lastly, I'm sure there are outliers. People who like the board game but hate the digital version. But, again - that should become obvious to you as you watch it played.  I think Nomad has done an excellent job translating the game. And as someone who has moved half-way across the world from their board game friends, it's a great way to keep in touch and get my fix. Happy gaming!",

If this was fixed promptly, this wouldn't be such an issue, but after numerous attempts to contact the developers, by email, and forums, with no reply, this game that I paid $40 for (Including season pass), is suddenly useless.  Edit: 15/3/2015 After several months (First reported 25/10/2014), I have been in contact with the developers, via the steam forums, who asked for my crash logs, said they were going to patch it, still no resolution.

While it's vaguely interesting, it's massively dominated by luck rather than strategy, and plays at a snail's pace once you know what's going on.  The default Crown of Command victory mechanic harshly punishes any player trying to win, effectively removing them from the game and having them roll a die every turn to see if they get closer to winning. During this time, other players can interrupt the lead player or heal themselves, build up their strength, reset the lead player's advantage, and then walk in and win an hour later. Luckily there are houserules that deal with this (instantly winning or disabling healing when someone reaches the Crown).  They try to keep it interesting with the runes, which you earn by playing a lot. All the runes do is give you a minor, but unfair, advantage. Additionally, custom classes and cards which were easy to incorporate in physical editions are sold in relatively expensive DLC packs, leaving the core game feeling sparse.  It could be fun as a lighthearted game with friends every once in a while.",

And with all the DLC, this game is just fantastic!!!.. I'm a hradcore gamer so i have a huge collection of physical boardgames, and i always wanted the REAL version of this game, but the cost for ithe game and all the expansions would be in the hundreds of dollars as opposed to the small cost of this, and the experience is the same and so much fun... again, highly recommended!!!",

It isn't the most deep and well designed board game, it's a bit too based on luck and while it's easy and can take more time to learn than most modern euro board games. That said, Talisman is a fun game to play with friends and socialize. This adaptation in particular is really good and faithful to the original, with a lot of controls to create and enforce house rules, and there are many expansions packs for you to pick and them to release. Bots play well but they don't play to win and so single player can be a bit frustrating, so get your friends together or make new ones online.",

        {
            "review_text": "There are constant problems. Timing of spells is the biggest one offhand. You often need to play a spell at the start of the affected character's turn but, at least when playing against the computer there is often no delay between after one character has moved (signifying the end of the start of it's turn) and the turn ending meaning. The queue system is very clunky and it is very easy to cast a spell/use an item too early, too late, or even at the completely wrong time due to it being playable at the wrong place in combat.  Also you cannot look at the board outside of your turn causing you to waste time doing it on your own turn if you missed something. In singleplayer you can look at the board outside of your turn but it pauses the game. There is no  sort of event log or even  way to view the discard piles (that I am aware of) so often things will flip by and you'll have no idea what transpired and no way to look. As mentioned in the comments there is an event log and it seems to have some good options for filtering.  In multiplayer there are often problems where one or more person will be disconnected and you get to rewatch the computer play the same turn(s) over. This seems to happen more often later in the game and w/ the city expansion but that's just my experience from 2-3 games.  Frequent crashes and glitches can cause players to miss the end of game meaning they get no in game credit or achievements for anything they would have earned there for potentially several hours of effort.   There was a recent patch addressing many outstanding issues with the game. End of game crashes most notably were addressed and I haven't seen that happen in the few games I've played since. I haven't seen any midgame crashes either, but I have not tried playing with the city expansion again.  One upside is the Season Pass actually comes with all the dlc with the exception of one which contributes to charity.  If most of these problems were addressed I would absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of the physical game.",

            "review_text": "If you desire a single- or local-player experience with a faithful and loyal recreation of one of the most treasured board games Games Workshop ever created, are interested in digital versions of board games for their ease of accessibility and how versatile they can be when playing with others/with yourself and some AI's, or even if you just want a good time-killer that you can come back to at any time when you wish to resume a game (a feature not currently available for the actual board game, I might add, without manual note-taking!) then I cannot recommend this enough.  I expect a lot are asking 'Then why are you not recommending this game?' It is a fair question: It is a very enjoyable board game, and a faithful recreation of the original source material. The gameplay is everything you would expect: Easy to pick up and play, harder to master, and the randomness of the card draws, the dice rolls and the shape of the board presence after about 50 turns in (and you will be playing more than this locally) means that no two games are ever the same in any playthrough, and victory is never certain: A risk-taking AI or one that gets better luck with their dice rolls could always be one step ahead of you, but there's always some way or another for the AI to be betrayed or lose their advantage, given the numerous random events that can transpire in the course of a game.  Why can I not recommend this game? Most who've played the board game or those who know how board games work in general know that it's better to play with friends. Unless you're willing to pass a laptop around - or play hot potato with the seat where your desktop is hiding out - the ability to play with friends since the 25th or so has nosedived. A quick look at the bug reporting section of the forums gives all the confirmation you may need: The change to the back-end of their online component has a lot of issues following a shift from a Steam-dependent component. I don't know why this change wasn't tested out before releasing it to the public (assuming that development costs aren't an issue) but it doesn't change the current state of the online component right now: A broken, unstable mess.  Having played several games online with the friends I also bought the game for, I got to experience some of these issues first-hand: Gameplay freezes after casting certain spells, the AI refuses to move in a timely manner in online games, starting up online games can sometimes be problematic to the point that you have to recreate the room (I always made mine private, but I would imagine this issue becomes worse for public rooms) and I've even experienced a crash in the 15-ish hours I've played this game online - or at least attempted to without any of these problems arising. Out of seven games, I only managed to have two completed: One was a two-player game, another a three-player that the other two players were forced to drop out of because they ended up having issues.  So to reiterate: In it's current state, this game is not completable online, in some cases it might not even be playable online. If you just want to play with your friends around the party table on a laptop or want to kill some time by yourself playing against some AI's, then this is a faithful recreation of the board game that you will get plenty of hours of enjoyment from (and given how the other 15 hours have been single-player and without any issues at all, I have no doubt of this). If you are, however, looking to play with friends over an online connection or have any desire to use the online component at all, then I have to recommend that you hold off until the issue is resolved with it's online component, as it is not in any fit state to be worth your time or your money.",

In several games, I've felt the overwhelming desire to ragequit simply because the game forces me into losing STUPID, nearly impossible to lose fights, even after spending points of Fate to reroll once.

For instance, the AI will use an axe to get across the river only to cross back to the outer area the next turn.  I would highly recommend this to people which enjoy tabletop games which contain both an element of strategy and an element of luck. There is a lot in this game which requires luck, but once you have played a few games, you can get a feel of what the better spaces and strategies are. Playing with random characters also forces you to get used to new ways of playing the game, making each game much different from the last.  Keep in mind, a single string of bad luck can pretty much end your run in the game or force you to play catch up for the remainder of the game if everyone else is doing well.",

            "review_text": "I made the mistake of playing this, being a board game aficionado of sorts. I like to think I 'play' a 'decent amount' of 'board games'.  I chose poorly here. Talisman is as follows: Roll dice. Go to space. Draw card. See what happens.  That's it. There is no planning, no strategy, no thought. Roll dice. Highest wins. I rolled more dice in 2 hours last night than I remember rolling at a lot of longer sessions of Dungeons and Dragons, and yet no a single one of the dice I rolled during the game of Talisman really meant anything. The content is repetitive and the game is a chore to play, as several points are designed to arbtrarily lengthen the game simply based on a die roll, teleporting you back to previous portions of the map, or lowering your stats (forcing you to grind more adventure card sto 'level up' again), or simply kill you outright (the vampire rolls a 6. Lose 6 life. You died. Back to start.)  And then, oh god, once you get to the end, you have a 50% chance of doing one damage per turn. I have never so fervently hoped for the dice to roll high so that I could die and the game could end, but the sweet, soothing release of death did not come. At the end, I watched a Wizard AI waltz up and slay the Fighter AI player who had gotten there mile sbefore him, nad had be simply rolled a 4, a 5, or a 6 at any point during the 9 turns he was on the Crown of Command, would have won the game. But he did not, and so Wizards win over martial classes once again. Thanks Wizards.  In its defense: This seems to be a well done translation of the board game. The automation works well and outside a few quibbles like trying to figure out how to queue spells, the game worked well and both players realized how to do everything (aside from trade in trophieS: I looked at aSteam guide for that) within a few rounds. But unfortunately, in this case, it's not really a plus: We figured it out so quickly, because there's just not that much to DO. So as a technical translation of a boardgame, it's very good. I am sure avid fans of Tlaisman will garner a greta amount of fun from the game, though I'm not sure I'd want to be there with them.  You might as well roll a 1d6 before the game starts, and highest winner places themselves on the cente rof the board and wins, because that's about what Talisman boils down to. 'More content' unfortunately would not fix what is an un-fun game to the core. At least Risk mitigates its dice rolling with the ability to actually choose and think over whta you do before you fling plastic cubes about.",

Talisman is great for fantasy lovers and offers lots of diferent heros with different abilities to play as, which is one of my favourite features in a game. All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential.   Although there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times.   Another thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise!   Expansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!    Pros:    -Lots of fun with friends  -Wide variety of heros  -Playable on a toaster  -Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn)  -Unpredictable  -Amazing when you have access to expansions  -You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!

That being said, this game really walks the line between whether or not to give it a positive or a negative review overall.  The design flaws of the Talisman game really manifest itself when you play with a rigid, impassionate interpreter of the game. This doesn't seem like a bad thing, but Talisman has evolved over the years with very little consistency: there's a huge variety of nuances in the language used. Phrases such as '...at any time...' implies a different expectation than what is actually practiced in the game.   The honest truth is, people zone out when they play Talisman. You miss a few turns in jail, or wait for four other players to battle dragons, abuse spells, and ponder over quests; just so you can roll a 3 and scoop up a bag of gold. There's a whole layer missing from the electronic version of the game that you get when you are playing on the tabletop with your friends that really is the only thing that makes Talisman an acceptable use of an afterrnoon.  The game would also benefit from an ability to remove specific cards from out of the deck; because there are some really grossly imbalanced combinations as well as cards you just get sick of seeing- like the one that takes all the face up city cards and put them on top of the adventure deck. The electronic version of the game also takes longer to play, as every step of the game is iterated out individually. The dice roller seems very suspect as well. I've had back to back snake eyes when dicing with death as well as +3 Craft from the Reaper in three stops.  The game does give you something to do while your waiting in a que or auto-running to your next mission, but it's hard to recommend solely on the experience it offers. To be honest, considering how horribly overpriced the Fantasy Flight version of the game is, I would still recommend this version of the game over the table top version. I'm sticking with my 2nd Edition Games Workshop version.",

            "review_text": "First off, unless I'm mistaken, this is my first Steam review. I hate that it's negative, but I am way too ticked off at this game NOT to give it a negative review. Second, this game makes me wish I had bought it AFTER the Stean refund policy change. I would refund this pile in a heartbeat. Now let me get into the things I hated about the game. Also, for the most part, you are not going to read anything here that are not in the other reviews. If you like the board game, you might like this if you don't crash. If not my gripes are similair to others  So, I bought this game a few months ago, but never got around to playing it. I left Neverwinter Nights, and get a pop-up saying if I buy a character for Talisman the profits with go to charity. Great! I love to help charity. And it is a shaman. Shamans and Druids are some of my favorite characters. So load up the game, and search the main page for a tutorial. There's none, which is troubling, but I figure, 'hey, it's probably a tutorial as you play kind of game'. Which it is. Problem is you ghave to choose your character with stats that you have NO CLUE what they do. So I do what I always do in a fantasy game where I'm not sure about the mechanics. I pick the Warrior, because it is almost aways the easiest class. I also make sure there is only one opponent, because i wanted the make the game as easy as possiblee.  Then I get into the game. My first turn I roll, get a 6 move to the temple. My whole strategy tois to get the two weapons that the fighter can have, then play from there. I roll again, then have to fight an ape. I lose. No prob. It's the beginning of the game, and I can't expect to win every dice roll. Now I don't remember all my opponents turns, (partly because he was taking turns when I was reading text) but basically he didn't have ONE bad thing happen on any of his turns. So, I take my thirds turn and fight a creature with craft, and lose again. Next turn, roll again, got a dragon, lost again. Now mind you, you don't get a choice on whether to fight or not. Some classes give some choice in some situations, but mostly, roll and get blssed or f-d. So, I'm down 3 lives, and have some event where I lose ANOTHER LIFE! My opponent. Again, my opponent has lost no life, and hasn't even had to fight. I am a WARRIOR and I have won no fights. I just want a weapon. So I spend my one gold to get back 1 hp because I am at one HP. THEN I get the second gold that would have allowed me to get a weapon. Then I roll a demon which I would have to roll a 6 to tie. So back to 1 hp. At this point I say F this game. So I want to see what happens when you die, so I attack the creature with craft (magic) because he should have an advantage. And THEN I win. *Faceplam*  Anyway I was done within 5 minutes of that. My opponent was already in the second ring. This game is JUST RANDOM LUCK. I own 600 on Steam, (though I've prob only played a little over 500 of them) and this will likely wind up on the bottom 50 of them.",

For the uninitiated let me explain.  For the first couple of hours I was enthralled. Learning all the rules, all the magical cards and their powers, all the items and followers. I thought I found something really deep to get my teeth stuck into. YAY! 4 hours in, I come to the damning and sad realisation. I am playing monopoly, in a D&amp;D setting... but it's still monopoly. Aka, roll a dice over and over until you win or lose. The lack of strategy and the high percentage of luck mean that the hour long games that are needed to complete Talisman feel like little more than flipping a coin over and over to see who gets more tails than the other.

This is a rare occurance, however, dependant on character chosen rather than any particular oversight due to the game design. There are plenty of new characters to purchase as well as three of the original six expansion packs already released. Dice roll for me is depressingly unlucky (just as it always was for my board games) so i find the gameplay quite difficult.

            "review_text": "Great port of an excellent board game. Everything that's in the board game is here, and is a nifty way to play games without having to keep the board somewhere in reality, as I'm sure any Talisman players will know, games can take a long time. The best way to describe it is a roguelike board game. You have a preset layout of a board, with some set pieces, but everytime someone lands on a square, you draw from the deck on order to determine what happens there. There's a good range of characters to choose from, all with their own special abilites as well as generic RPG stats by any other name. Purchase of the dlc characters is up to you, given the already strong roster and I feel the asking price for those is fair enough.   It's not flashy as a video game, and you pretty much just get a digital representation of the board game, aside from animations for the dice being rolled and a few flashes, there isn't much in the way of graphics. Whether or not you feel the game is worth the admission price depnds on the person. The real life base game plus Reaper and Dungeon expansions will burn a whole in your wallet to the tune of around £80 so this is considerably cheaper than that, but people who are new to board games may be turned off by the asking price, in which case you'd be fair to wait for a sale. But if you like board games, this is an excellent purchase which will do you well.   The dlc works very nicely with other people too; as long as someone has it, everyone in the game can access it, so no worrying about the player base being cut off, I only have the Reaper expansion myself, but that adds a whole new level to the game play on its own, presumebly the other DLC is as high quality.   There's hotseat as well as online, so those with a tablet pc can emulate the real board game even further. However the online is VERY unstable at the moment, so I'd stick to hotseat or LAN till they fix it. If you were planning on only playing online, I'd reccomend holding back on your purchase till that is fixed, otherwise you'll likely get left out in the cold.",

The game is best played among friends or with people willing to chat and get into the intrigue of attacking each other, forming alliances, and general ♥♥♥♥ talking each others bad luck.

I played Talisman when it first came out. When I found out it was on Steam, I was intrigued. When I picked it up with the Humble Bundle, I was interested in giving it a shot.  I enjoy the game. I enjoy running around the board, gathering power, and making a push for the crown, leaving everyone in my dust. Yes, the game begins fairly random, but there is a strategy to the game, and if you know what you're doing, the game becomes less and less random as you shape your character into the champion (or horror) you want it to be.  Some simple tactics: 1) Get to the Warlock and try to get the Clockwork Owl as quickly as you can. This turns your die rolls for movement into something you can control (since you can move your die roll or less after this). 2) Get to the warlock and get the bag of holding. Having 8 concealable slots to carry your most precious gear in is a good thing. 3) Go to the warlock and get the orb of prophesy (or be lucky and draw the magic item which does similar). This allows you to control your encounters. Along the way you should be getting magic items or followers to pad out your abilities. But once you have those three items (or heck, even just the first), you're able to control your fate fairly well, and can make the push to get to the middle of the board and win.  The introduction of runestones is an interesting twist, as is having fate points. Those both help to deter getting hosed early in the game, and I think they're a workable addition. I plan on picking up the expansions.  I give the Digital Edition of Talisman 4/5.",

Then it crashed altogether when the AI tried to play lucky charm on a Ghost encounter... selected a 6 for the dice roll and the game closed with an error message to email support (which I did).  So I strongly urge the developers to FIX the expansion content... I see they have so many more expansions offered, why would I buy the newer ones when the first DLC is buggy?

Sessions take between 1-5hrs at a time depending a lot on dumb luck with rolls and overall it's well worth the price on sale. Multiplayer is solid and putting friend sessions together is also pretty easy. 8/10 game.",

No problem, they cast teleport on their next turn, go to the warlock, just happen to roll the quest to deliver a follower and boom, free talisman. It's all random, riiiiight.",

            "review_text": "As someone who regularly brought Talisman (Second Edition) to Sega game nights and who no longer has a group to tabletop game with, my knee-jerk reaction to seeing a digital version available on Steam was one of irrepressible excitement - I didn't even bother reading any reviews, I just bought it immediately, so compelling was my nostalgic glee. Boy, what a dope I was. In fact, playing this now, I can't even imagine or remember why I liked it so much in the first place. To paraphrase another reviewer, all this game wants to do is make you lose. I thought perhaps one of the expansions might make it a little better, but here's how a list of the Reaper Expansion adventure cards reads: A robber gobsmacks you from behind - lose all gold; flash flood - if you have a mule, it dies a miserable, horrible death by drowning and you lose all your possessions; plague outbreak: all your followers become infected with bubos and die miserable, horrible deaths. And so on. Actual play with AI characters using the base set goes something like this: AI player 1: roll 5, land on a Forest; you encounter a frightening, powerful Wraith...who smiles at you and gives you an Amulet - no one can harm you with a spell, ever! AI player 2: roll a 3, land in the Crags; you found three gold! AI player 3: roll a 6, land on a Field; you encounter a fiery, angry dragon - you pit your Strength 3 Wizard against a giant Strength 7 reptile...and win! You: roll a 1, land on a Stream; your Strength 7 Troll encounters a Strength 2 Wolf...and loses! Lose 1 Life! Lose all Gold! Lose all will to live or ever play this effing game ever again! Basically, you spend hours and hours trying to beef up at least one trait so that you are strong enough to pass a duel with the Sentinel guarding the gate to the middle ring, then work your way through the middle ring (which is ten orders of difficulty harder than the outer ring was) to pass a trial which will allow you to get to the center of the board and engage in ultimate combat to see who is the winner. Unless someone has the Reverse Decision spell, which can reverse the outcome of any combat, making you start all over again from the beginning. There is very little fun to be found in this game, both by design and because of the clunky, unfriendly nature of the user interface (after seven hours, I STILL can't figure out how to make sure I get to use a particular item or a spell in combat). Also, it uses the first edition art, which is fussy, cluttered, and amateurish at best, and, 'Hey, my little brother got a gold star in his art class, can he draw the Prophetess card?' at worst. MIGHT be fun for five seconds from a nostalgia standpoint, but, really...save your money - just look at the screen shots and video and say to yourself, 'there but for the grace of gaming gods go I.'",

I have not played any of the expansions for this game nor I have played this game online. This review will be just from what I have played against the computer.  The game does look nice but I do believe a little more animations would be ideal. Also, if the game speed could increase overall when playing against the computer would also be helpful, only slowing down during necessary parts like when the computer is giving a player a chance to cast a card before another action is about to be played.  I still very strongly believe the computer DOES CHEAT. However, if you catch on how the computer cheats, you can beat it. Usually you have to stick it out and survive. I have had the computer give me terrible rolls and target my character even though it is only the third strongest from everyone. Yet if I survive despite a computer character using the Crown of Command, it will kill off the other players, leaving their belongings behind which usually empower my character enough to survive while building up stats so that I can easily reach the last character and kill him/her. Sometimes the computer will act strangely, like killing off one of its own characters.  Still, it is a fun game overall and if you can bear through some of the BS you will likely see in the game, you should be able to come out on top.",
