The first person aspect really shines with its 3D scenes and ability to look around in every direction. The sheer number of inventory items and MacGyver-like gameplay made it a treat to figure out all the different puzzles. The story is engaging and intriguing, plus the graphics are reasonably attractive. This is a soundly enjoyable game.",

You ll have to play it several times, to discover all the secrets and options.   The only bad thing about this game is, if you are used to it you can finish it in less then 90min.",

This game is also unique in that it gives multiple ways to solve each section. The story is great, the visuals are good. The puzzles can get hard at times, but just circle around and remember to look at the ground. I give it a 8/10. It loses a few points for being short (although you could always replay it for alternate methods of solving puzzles) as well as there being no hint system. There's also a few action sequences that can be a bit infuriating to deal with.",

Also, hover-monkies. Seriously.  I liked the story side of it, but I wish there had been more of it. Finished the game in 6 hours of play, though there is a system in place that would let you play it again and do things differently... I'm just not interested in replaying the same story just so I can create a battery out of lemons instead of nitrate.",
