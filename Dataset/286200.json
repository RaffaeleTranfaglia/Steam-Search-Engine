            "review_text": "Store page says: 'city building political strategy game with match-3 tower defense combat'  That is a lie. What is more, that is an unnecessary lie. Yeah this game has some building in it, but it is even more shallow than Facebook games like 'Hayday'. Yes, this game has some policy options which does not effect gameplay in any meaningful way. These two things are not main part of the game, they are just spices to make player sure that he actually is not playing some kind of 'Candy Crush'.  That is also a lie. This game heavily resembles Candy Crush. Actually, if I were to sum it up, 'Candy Crush with tower defense elements.' That is not as bad as it sounds, since we all know about addictiveness of candy crush. Gameplay mechanics are rather solid, most of the weapons and skills has their own uses. Policy options are just there for the sake of feeling like a king, not a 3-matcher. Soldiers have their own uses as well, but Scouts (the elite ones) maybe a bit unbalanced since they are the obvious choose for almost all missions.  I got this game from Humble Bundle, which also includes Paranautical Activity, Stacking and Windforge. The funny part is I got that bundle for Stacking. But this was the game I played most among those. Why? It is addicting. It gives sense of success. But if u despise mechanics of Candy Crush, you wont like this game. This is guaranteed, It has more complex mechanics when it comes to battles, but the main part is the same.  I have two more complaints. One: Resource system is a bit unbalanced. You earn money by waiting, you can earn some infinitesimal money in battle as well, which has no practical uses. Every thing needs wood. Almost nothing needs ore. And you wont need food after you upgraded your town center to level 5. Yes, it should not be more complex than this since this is basically a match 3 game but if these mechanics exist I would want it to be more gamey.  Second. After all this time, (and this is actually the second game first being Tower of Elements) there are still some gamebreaking bugs. If you use some spells which alters the gameboard too much (like Landslide, Tornado etc), and dont wait it to be completed, some cells includes two different colors which is practically impossible to complete the chapter after that. If you wait after using those spells no bug is there, I guess if there is a restriction on using heavy skills one after other, the way it is restricted should not be via a bug.  But still. If you find this game cheap. Real cheap. Under 4 dollars even, I would recommend it if you like such casual games. Since it got me hooked, and I actually finished it with most of achievements unlocked, I feel obliged to recommend it. By the way, this game will be fun for achievement hunters as well since it has well defined goals. Just dont be deceived by claims of the game about being a political simulator, true successor of Sim City 3000 etc, and if you cant find a good deal, go online and search for similar games for free.",

            "review_text": "It has the most basic of town building mechanics. It is very reminicant of the facebook games that take time to build the resource or building, for example if you want to harvest lumber, you would click on the lumber mill to harvest lumber, and it eould start a countdown timer until the lumer is ready, this seems like an odd choice for a game that costs money, and does not have micro transactions. Also the buildings placement and type are pre-defined, and the only choice you have is what order to upgrade them in.    The match 3 game part of it is kinda neat. Matching 3 in a row sends over bolt of magic a t advancing mobs, but it is more of a frantic rush of tring to find a match. it is more about finding any match then choosing matches to make a chain reaction.  The devs have made some updates to this since launch so thank you devs, but it is still not an interesting enough game for me to recomend",

ReignMaker, however, plays like a mobile game trying to be a full PC game - the gameplay just feels too sluggish and unresponsive with a mouse and the unnecessary time delay mechanics just feel tagged on.  Maybe worth it at a lower price...",

The city-building aspect is on a timer and everything is sooooo slow; you can't just sit down and play, you have to wait for a really slow timer (like on a Facebook game) before you research items or have enough lumber to build anything. Some of the boss battles were also quite frustrating - I finally quit the came when I encountered a boss that I can't come close to beating, and don't want to wait the hours (literally, many hours) it will take for the upgrades I need so I have a chance to beat them.",

The game feels like a concept of a fecebok game - click on your mine to collect materials, it givs you 1 gold/second and holds max 35 gold. You can upgrade it to hold more gold. Sounds familiar?  The gameplay looked like fun, only to turn out to be imbalanced. You can approach a boss 20 times and fail, only to switch a lucky rock and unleash a barrage of bulets obeliterating everything in its ay. Sonds like fun until you realize that it has nothing to do with your skill. It's pure luck game.  Pick this only if you like slot machines gameplay: start a game: 'nope, start a game - nope, ... start a game - aww ysss I am awesome!'",

            "review_text": "ReignMaker is an interesting take on the match-3 genre, adding a whimsical personality to a game-type of which many may have thught no new game needed to be made. Well, ReignMaker did. Matching tiles means something: you are defending a world from hordes of evil. And not only are you defending it, you will see it grow and care for its inhabitants, as you run your own little town in this world. The town is a major part of the game. Here you train units to help you in your battles, create equipment and research spells. And you produce the resources with which to do all that. But more than that, you make decisions that will make the town feel unique: whenever you beat a new level, a policy decission will be presented to you, asking you to guide your town. How do you handle crop failure? Do you let that reknown berserker settle in your town? What do you say about theatrical plays that corrupt our youth? All these decission will affect your town one way or another. You may get a free scholar to help your reseach. You may end up with more rabbits around your town or piles of purple fungal mold. And your citizens may live in a republic or end up in an oppresive tyranny. It is up to you. Either way, it will be cute and humorous.  Just don't listen to the random citizen who will want to move to Troj. There is always one person like that. Can't please them all.  One warning though: this game gets really tough.",

It seems that they drew on some of the best elements of what makes games potentially great: (1) solid core concept, (2) great design, (3) outer elements from the core to keep it interesting.  While I have only played for an hour, I anticipate that I will keep playing. This was a good purchase and one that I would highly recommend.",

            "review_text": "If you like Match-3 style games then this may be fun. I enjoyed the early stages, but getting further along the game goes from casual fun to plain tedious. Some of that is just the usual match-3 luck of the draw where the player's actions are not necessarily related to the outcome. I may also just be terrible at this kind of game.  The 'city-building' and 'politics' are largely tacked on. I enjoy the politics aspect, basically after winning a board a random (?) event occurs and you are given several thematic options on how to handle the event. Some choices might just give you some flavour dialogue, other choices will add decorations to the town, some choices will give you a one-time resource boost, while other choices may give you a permanent, though minor, buff to some aspect of the game itself. If you choose enough of a particular thematic choice your town will 'become' that thematic element (nature lovers, republic, militaristic, etc.) I enjoy the politics and choices though they are just a sidenote in the game.  You may often find you are unable to make matches in certain areas, which allows the enemies that are coming at you to destroy your tower unimpeded. You can hire and bring up to two different unit types into combat with you, but I often find they rarely are useful in defending the tower in the areas where the player may not have much ability to. You can also bring in spells and items, which can help at times, though the items tend to be resource intensive, which is problematic when resources in the game are gained in real time. Resources also can, and will, hit a maximum storage capacity in the resource gathering facility, making it so you have to check in often early on if you want to be able to get enough resources to upgrade buildings and research spells and items, which also happen in real time. The resource aspect of the game is off-putting to me as it feels a great deal like a pay-to-win, mobile game, despite the fact there is no premium currency in the game, which is great, I hate games doing that, but in a full game it just feels out of place and tedious.  The game isn't bad, it just isn't good. I find myself going back to play every now and then, it'll take me a long time before I 100% it, should I ever, but I just can't recommend it. It is a test in patience more than anything a lot of the time.",

It adds quite a lot of extras though like making choices about the future of your village, resource management and loads of spells/units/items to use during battles.   My only gripe is that enemies approach your castle and you have to match a square on the same row as them to destroy them. This is fine but the maps get a bit... creative, and it can be really difficult to match on certain rows. There are some maps that are diamond-shaped and the top and bottom rows literally only consist of 1-square. It makes it very difficult. Oh, and I think the bosses are a little too hard, as you pretty much always take a lot of unavoidable damage, and your rating afterwards depends on the health of your castle.   But mostly it's pretty fun.",
