            "review_text": "I've played a lot of tower defense. I used to play Warcraft III custom maps where the tower defense genre was cut from. Defender's Quest does a nice job of putting a well developed story with well developed characters into tower defense gameplay without it feeling pasted on.   It keeps it simple. There are only a few basic towers to choose from, but each tower acts like a character in your party and you can equip most of them with weapons and armor (no weapons or armor for a dragon and no armor for the barbarian/main melee guy). The maps are laid out well enough that consideration to where to place your troops does make a big difference.  There is also a nice take on the gameplay by offering 4 difficulty levels. You get rewards for completing the level, but you get bonus rewards for not taking a single point of damage. If you do that, you can get a lot of extra scrap (money) and unique items.  What I'm doing on my second playthrough is going as far as I possibly can while only buying recruits and never any items on the easiest mode. When I hit my first failure, I go back to the very start and try to complete each level on the hardest mode possible. After I fail once, I will go down to an easier mode and so on until I am right back at the easiest mode and therefore, the furthest out I've ever been.  The main game is not that long and there isn't a ton of replayability to this game once you complete it. That is why it is only worth a few bucks...but it's worth a few bucks. I hear they are making a Defender's Quest II and I hope that is at least as good. Even when it is, this is still a pretty fun tower defense and something that feels more refreshing than you might think when you come back to it after a long time.",

            "review_text": "Well, reviewing a title that is available for 2 years now seems useless, yet i'll do it anyway :-)  Judging by the graphics i wonder why i even bought it. Maybe because i like Tower-Defense-Games. But i was suprised with this cute little quillet.  What exactly is it? It's a TD-Game without towers. But with people. Typical RPG-People like berzerkers, mages, healers and rangers and... And you'll keep your 'Towers' throughout the game and they'll receive XP and level-up. You can even color them and give them names. You move through a story with cutscenes, but mainly you'll fight waves of enemies with your party.   The good:     Borderless fullscreen AKA non-exclusive Fullscreen. Yay. Scaled to your resolution OR changed resolution. Nifty!    Don't like the speed of advancement? Change XP/monetary reward to 300%! Or 50%.    Leveling and outfitting your 'towers' is a nice approach. You'll have veterans and noobs to place on each map.    Speed adjustment from 0x (pause) to 4x. Nice. Pausable at all times. No pressure there.    You can adjust your partymembers fighting tactics and even make them persistant (attack which target first, use high power abilities on lower foes etc.)    Beside your party you'll have your main hero that has misc. spells at her disposal.    TD-like you can play each map in different difficulties with proportional rewards. It pays to replay an older mission on EXPERT!    The way they make you 'like' their facebook/twitter-page was really cute. I almost felt bad NOT to click :-)    Workshop! For those extra hours to waste    It has a real story with cute cutscenes. I admit to have skipped much of it, but for some it may add immersion.    The bad:     For some, it may possibly lack depth of strategy/difficulty. It looks more like a 'casual' tower-defense.    Ok, to be nit-picky: The skills you're able to choose are too few. No big descisions to make, you're getting them all more or less anyway.    TL;DR:  Bought 'Defenders of time' at the same time and it seemed much more promising. Oh boy was i wrong. Kicked 'DoT' off of my HD after 2 minutes and played this one for hours. Graphics is not everything. This is a fun and refreshing towerdefense-game where you keep your 'towers' and level them up. Also you'll try to outfit them with better weapons and armor. I surely had my fun. Would be even worth fullprice!",

            "review_text": "While this is a decent little game, I think it fails to really deliver on its core promises. It's worth some money and time, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.  The game bills itself as primarily a tower defense game. Tower defense games generally require you to come up with a strategy to defeat the enemies given a particular map and set of resources. Defender's Quest maps are much simpler, and to a large extent don't require much strategy. That's where the 'RPG' part comes in. There's not really any role-playing going on, but your characters get stronger and you can buy better weapons and armor for them. The maps don't rely so much on strategy as on having characters that are high enough level and have good enough equipment. And that generally means grinding for XP. So when it comes to the advanced and extreme levels, it's not that the levels are possible but you have to have a better strategy. The levels are simply impossible to start with, and the only way you can beat them is by leveling up your characters.  In short, it's not a good tower defense game (because the challenges rely primarily on having high-level characters not strategy), and it's not a good RPG (because there's no real role-playing, just 'numbers going up' as you and the enemy gain levels and equipment). So I think it rather fails the 'tactical depth' promise.  The second promise is customization, and it does have options to rebind all the keys and change the XP scaling, character names and colors, etc., but I don't think it's a big deal. The developer also put thought into how he could accomodate people with certain disabilities (like epilepsy), which is nice.  The third is story, and I suppose that's where this game does best. The story isn't great, but it does give a reason to keep playing and it is fairly humorous in some parts.  Technically, the game is well-made, even if it appears dated. I can't recall any bugs in the game, and it has been very stable. The game runs at 800x600 resolution, which is fine for me. The sound effects and music are well-done, but lack variety, which is okay for me.  I just wish the game rewarded thinking more than it rewards grinding. It's worth a try if you can get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "Defender's Quest is a novel rpg take on the tower defense genre. That in and of itself would make an interesting game, but the designers saw fit to include an interesting story to explain away the game mechanics as part of the plot. While the central theme of plague and the risen dead is dark, the dialogue between characters is lighthearted and oftentimes funny. Such a combination of serious undertones and bright interplay amongst the characters helped me enjoy the game quite a bit.  Insofar as the actual mechanics are concerned, this is not a 'maze building' tower defense game. The enemies will come in waves along pre-defined paths with limited placement for your defenders (the towers, essentially) available. Defenders can be upgraded by 'boosting' them through five levels which unlocks any abilities they may have earned through levelling and a rudimentary talent system. Speaking of levelling, this is where the rpg mechanic comes into play; every level gained by a defender gives you talent points which you can use to tweak the character and gain new abilities. While the talent system is very basic, it does give you a feeling of satisfaction to distribute your points when a defender levels or you gain access to a new class.   While there are only six classes of defender to use in the game, the customization inherent in the rpg progression system means there is the possibility of some differentiation. Additional defenders can be recruited in towns across the game's story map, wherein the plot is advanced and new battlefields are opened up. In battle, these defenders are placed with the same resource you use for upgrading, but recruiting new defenders gets progressively expensive with the game's story mode currency (won through battle). That same currency is used for equipping your defenders with weapons and armor, so there is an opportunity cost. As additional currency can be won by going back and fighting harder versions of prior story mode battles at any time, you never truly feel strapped for cash.  As the game is 2d, the question isn't whether the graphics are advanced, but how good and cohesive they look. Cut scenes to advance the plot are drawn with a style which gels extremely well with the battle sprites and look pleasing to the eye. Opinions on art styles will vary, but the cleanliness and cohesiveness of the game's visuals can not be denied. There are no sloppy looking sprites in this game and your defender's colors can even be customized to a limited degree to further suit your tastes.   Unfortunately, while the animations of your defenders (and especially that of a certain antagonist at the very end of the game) are fluid and pleasing to watch, the animations of the monsters which you are tasked to kill are very basic and stilted. Still, most of the time said monsters are drowning in a sea of pleasing damage numbers as your defenders are chopping them to pieces, so perhaps some gamers will be able to overlook this as I did.  According to steam, I was able to extract 13 hours out of this game and there are still bonus challenges to complete and a new game plus mode to experiment with. Whether that is worth the price of admission is a decision that I encourage you to weigh carefully if you would normally pass up a game based on length: it is lovingly crafted and an enjoyable experience that I can recommend to any rpg fan, even those who aren't familliar with tower defense games.  The long and short of it: 8/10, buy it.",

As these heroes fight, they level up and can be built into different styles of tower depending on the skills you take.  Pros - Lots of good tower defense gameplay - Lots of well done RPG elements so you can modify each hero and personalize your play style - Good story and interesting characters - Lots of great items to equip to make your heroes (towers) even more effective - The game rewards replay of older levels on higher difficulties by giving your heroes (towers) more experience and the ability to unlock special items - Lots of replay value with all the difficulty levels and all the things that can be unlocked. - Challenging maps that sometimes require you to think outside your normal setups.  Cons - Older graphics - Gameplay can be repetative if you're just interested in the story  Overall this is a great game that I would highly recommend to an RPG or tower defense enthusiast. The game gives you the option of both relaxed gameplay and very challening maps if you want them. (It also rewards your party for completing said maps.)",

Has an astounding new game plus feature with almost as much care put into the difficulty balance, adding sidequests, a new gear tweaking system, and a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move or twelve in endgame. You also get spells to control the flow of the battle more, a half-speed option for tougher segments or micromanagement if you prefer, and none of this will ruin your sweet, sweet achievements in any way. Game wants you to play it, not get stuck in place for weeks on end.  Top 3 of its genre, guaranteed, and I only say top 3 because I know some people disagree with me on what the other two'd be.

I saw it was a tower defense game, and I said to myself, 'This is only a few bucks, I'll try it out.' Oh my, I didn't know how much I would love this game.  Defender's Quest is a tower defense game with RPG elements, mainly experience points, skill trees, and a good story inbetween the gameplay. It the game has humor, which is rather welcome. The gameplay is where this game really shines.  This is simply the best tower defense game I've ever played. You may have played a tower defense game before, but you haven't played Defender's Quest. It has a lot of depth to its gameplay, it has a very intuitive UI and an unobtrusive tutorial that is very helpful. Tutorial can be turned off entirely in the options, if you really want to. While you're at it, you can increase the experience and gold you get from the game to make it easier, or crash it into the ground and make the game harder. The music fits the game's atmosphere perfectly. I haven't even mentioned that you can mod every aspect of this game yet. Go look in the workshop; the creators of the game made a free sci-fi version of the game just to show you how much flexibility there is in regular modding.  Everything I've mentioned was made better with the recent update. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. 10/10.",

It is not terribly difficult to beat the game, however new game + and the secrets hidden in the game are very difficult. Unfortunately it took a community of players to find all the secrets in the game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you like the challenge.

I still didnt complete the whole game 100% because you can actually increase the game speed by a certain amount and sometimes on really busy maps the game crashes.

Grinding reminds me of a job. Defender's Quest lets you bypass that - anything you'd have to grind for is optional, and if you want the optional content, then you can toggle the exp and gold gain. This also lets you set the difficulty to as difficult or as easy as you want.  The amazing thing is that the gameplay is so good, and the rest of the game is also so good.

My only complaint is that there is a lot of stuff in New Game+ that felt like it should've just been left in the first playthrough. A normal play through feels like a light rpg experience you might get on a mobile game. The New Game+ on the other game actually feels more like a great new addition for RPG and Tower Defense fans alike.  PS- If you are a completionist, or just want to challenge yourself, there is an achievement for finishing the game without hiring any generic units. You basically have to win the game with only one of each unit type. It can be done, and I actually found the game more fun to play this way.",

If you're more hardcore, the 'one hero per class' challenge is a ton of fun, and really stresses your skill at tower defenses.",

The story and dialog are humorous and of appropriate lengths while remaining interesting and giving the game purpose. Warning: vets will be challenged by the (selectable) high level of difficulty.

You also have the option to control the difficulty to be as easy or as hard as you prefer. Harder the challenge, the bigger the payoff. Real strategy players are going to find the regular game a little too easy, but the game does offer unique challenges for the elite. Gamers new to strategy games will find it very welcoming. It is a game for every level of gamer, from casual beginner, to advanced tactician.",

For the price, and supporting a small studio, well worth it.  Graphics are decent - the art is so so at best, the pixel work is much more pleasant than the 'cutscenes', which no offense intended, are tacky at best. The story is decent, but is sorta held back by some kinda ridiculous one-liner attempts at humor and non-sequitor silliness, but all that said, I would say I enjoyed the game all in all.",

So overall, a fairly good game for it price.  *old review* It a good game. Why is my review not Recommended? It eleven pounds! If it was a fiver, that would be fine, but 11?  It look a flash game, it play like a flash game, but you can feel the work and effort put into this game. If you pay the full price, you will feel ripped off playing it.  So unless the price has gone down or it in a sale, avoid. If it in a sale putting it near that 5, buy for these guys deservse it and it a game any fan of TDs.   If you are not a fan of TDs, go to kongregate, you can play the first act for free and see if you like it.",

In this TD your towers are characters, that you will place on predefined maze, in order to stop the creeps from getting to Azra (the main character). The characters have persistent level ups (RPG), along side traditional tower level ups (TD), this makes that game a bit easier to manage when it comes to placing them on the battlefield. Characters automatically attack and chose which ability to attack with, unless otherwise told not to use an ability. Azra has several spells that can fight back against the oncoming hordes such as healing all placed characters and raining down fireballs to continuously burn enemies.   In the game Azra has been tossed into the pit for contracting the plague, which she quickly overcomes to meet a loopy swordsman. The game manages to walk that fine line between seriousness and humor throughout the campaign. As you make your journey across the over-map you gained more survivors to your band with anywhere from 7-37 characters in your company, however only 7 are story related the rest are just generic copies of Azra 6 followers. You can assign all characters in your party with names other than the default ones, and generic defenders can be assign a color schema. There is a hard level cap of 60 for all characters, therefore you will not be able to max all characters abilities (higher difficulties you will have prioritize the best move set for your characters).    This is game is design philosophy has the old school mentality when it comes to unlockables: new game plus that adds sidequests/challenge maps (like fighting waves upon waves of sheep), harder story maps, and journal entries, books to equip Azra, unique weapons and armor/ their upgrades. Game allows you to fine to how easy or hard you want the game to be like granting no exp upon failure, increase the speed of the game. The game is very well supported by the developer, in fact received an HD upgrade without making the user pay for it again.   TL:DR highlights      humorous characters     a TD game with an actual plot     persistent level ups     free HD version and soundtrack     new game plus  ",

But seriously, if Tower Defense/RPG hybrid sounded at all interesting, just get it.  Update: The new Deluxe edition update, which was free to everyone who already owned the game, is pretty good. The game no longer runs in Adobe Air/Flash, which is a nice change. The updated graphics are nice, if only somewhat incremental (not that that is bad, the game looked fine already).

Through the game's substantial and satisfying campaign, you'll assemble a motley crew of heroes who serve as your 'towers' in this tower defense game. Unlike towers, however, your heroes will level up as they gain experience, and you can assign various skills and pieces of equipment to them. It's fun stuff.  The developers for this game are fantastic, and their continued work on Defender's Quest highlights their 'long tail' philosophy. Rather than abandoning their game after release, Level Up Labs have diligently improved upon their work, adding content, improving the graphics, and rebuilding the engine. Defender's Quest is far more refined now than it was upon release, and its developers ought to be proud.   Defender's Quest is an excellent game with a committed development team, and I very much look forward to its in-development sequel.",
