The game is set in a distant future, when the life on the Earth’s surface has long since been made impossible and the remnants of humanity now dwell in the Underrail, a vast system of metro station-states that, it seems, are...",

            "review_text": "Again this is a game where 'recommend' or 'not recommend' doesn't mean anything. It mostly depend on who you are, what kind of gamer you are.  If you are craving for an old school Fallout-like game, go for it, you probably won't be disapointed.  But it's 2015 now, and even if I think that some old games ( especially RPGs ) were a lot better in the past, it's not a reason to keep their flaws as current game mechanics, or even putting annoying stuff in a game on purpose. Some examples as a warning for potential buyers :  - the tutorial only covers three things : using a gun, lockpicking, and stealth, because that's obviously the skills required for anyone living in this world. And then the game continues on that way, giving you the choice between a gun, a crossbow and a knife. Ok... but what if I did a Psionic character ? What if I didn't invest any point in ranged or melee ? Though luck, you start without any Psi ability. First you need to unlock your Psi potential by talking to a doctor, whom then leads you to NPCs who could maybe teach you some skills. The first one required me to have 35 and 45 points in Psi to learn stuff, but at level 1 you're capped at 15 points, so you need several levels before learning that. Another NPC only agreed on teaching me a single free skill ( need to pay for others ), AFTER I complete some quest requiring to kill rathounds with... a crossbow. Wait... what ? In order to have a single Psi ability I need to do a quest using a crossbow, but I have no points in ranged combat or crossbow and that's exactly why I need Psi stuff ?  That would be like starting as a mage in Baldur's Gate with 4HP, no spells, no companions and only a sword, forcing you to go melee until you can finally buy some expensive spell after 4 levels...  OK, the game begins to punish you for picking anything else than the cookie-cutter gun/crossbow ranger or melee brute. Fine. Let's start over with a new character.  - another thing is the total lack of map, making it a nightmare to navigate in the maze of metro tunnels. Characters just give you vague information about your destination like if you already knew the levels by heart, and the journal is of no help at all : 'complete all the tasks for NPC X and come back to NPC Y'. Yeah thanks... I love to wander aimlessly into labyrinths, killing mobs, wasting my ammo and heal.  - merchants will only buy a certain ammount of a certain item, and nothing else. Like, this guy ONLY buys 2 leather armors and one pair of boots. You can stick all your other loot up your ♥♥♥♥... also, all merchants are cutthroats, I think the exchange rate is like 300% of the base price. HOWEVER some items like weapons have a really high price, and you will probably find enough of them to get a nice ammount of money early enough. I found/looted on ennemies at least 3 or 4 guns and 2 crossbows already, enough to cover my needs in lockpicks and some gear.  - stealth is really stupid as your character's vision is really limited, so you won't be able to see anything past a corner for example. Mobs move really quickly compared to you, so good luck knowing if they are looking in your direction or not. Maybe they should have added some sound, or onomoatopeia to tell you an ennemy is near ( like in the game XIII adapted from the comic, you can 'see' the sound of ennemies step to locate them ). Because there is no way our character doesn't hear a big sentry bot coming his way from afar...  - overall the game is really slow and boring, the character can't run of course.  - the world seems really serious and there is not a single hint of humor like in Fallout or BG. instead the characters will KO you if they don't like your tone.  - inventory is terrible, and some fonts are downright unreadable.  Gonna update this after I play some more. I can't 'not recommend' the game despite its flaws, because I guess it's still a nice game, but some aspect will probably turn people off.  EDIT : now some things I like about the game  - there is a lot of loot and your inventory is not too small so you can take a lot of stuff. As you can't sell everything to any merchant you can stock your loot and crafting material in your appartment.  - there is generally several ways to progress : stealth, lockpicking/hacking, brute force, dialogue, etc. For example you can use your lockpicking skill and an omnitool to unlock a ventilation shaft, or a crowbar and your stength. However doing a non-combattant character seems impossible, or at least really hard, as there will probably be ennemies you can't talk with blocking your path. Maybe if you max your stealth, lockpicking, hacking, persuasion and intimidation, and find/buy the right tools ( which requires either luck or knowing the game already to have what you need at the right moment ), AND if you're ready to reload a save a bunch of time to learn ennemies patterns to sneak successfully, yeah it should be doable.  - graphics are nice enough  - you can detect secret passages with a high perception. Not something you find in a lot of games.  - the lighting affects stealth. When you step in shadows, your character portrait will go dark to tell you you're more difficult to spot. Trying to sneak in plain light won't end good. Fortunately most of those tunnels are dark.",

            "review_text": "I've been waiting for something like this to appear ever since playing Fallout 2. If you're a fan of the Fallout series in general, you won't be disappointed.  Let's go over some pros and cons. Keep in mind, this list is not all-inclusive; just some of the plusses or minuses that immediately come to mind.  Pros:   -Old-school feel with isometric camera -Interesting combat system using initiative to decide turn order -Many different character builds available, such as guns, crossbows, melee, unarmed, psi, and throwing. Within each weapon category there are different weapon types, and specialized feats assoiciated with them -Ability to avoid most or all combat situations if one wishes to play a diplomat-type character -Three difficulty settings, and two choices for how the main character gains experience. One favoring experience via exploration and quests (which reinforces the ability to play as a diplomat), and one favoring killing and quests.  -Comprehensive crafting system  Cons:  -Debatably difficult at the start of the game due to the tutorial only breaking the ice of the way combat mechanics function -Lack of in-game map  Yes, I have only listed two cons, the first of which is easy to over come with a little play-time. The second con, which is my only real gripe about the game, is that there's no in-game map.  This is an issue because there's very many zones in the game, which aren't labeled, and once you get away from the city and start transitioning through many zones, it can begin to almost feel like you're in a maze.  Hopefully something regarding the map will be addressed sometime in the future.  In conclusion, the amount of content in this game is staggering. The amount of value for the price of this title is off the charts. I HIGHLY recommend you pick this up if you're a fan of the older Fallout games, or are just a fan of isometric turn-based RPGs in general. ",

            "review_text": "Honestly, one of the best titles I've purchased in years. UnderRail breathes the much needed creative life into the world of games which seems so easily stagnated by copy/pasta game-engines and uninspired design.  If you enjoyed a lot of the older Interplay/Black Isle productions, Shadowrun (SNES/Genesis), Fallout 1&amp;2, and many of the other absolute isometric classics--UnderRail is definitely for you. The writing is excellent and already pushes the immersive environment even further. The game world, character build, world mechanics and interaction are all very large and of non-linear design with countless iterations. This is a very well polished, creative and complete game.  - Review updated post-release:  After putting nearly 100 hours of playtime into the early-access version, I'm picking the game back up with a fresh start to finish the full game. In starting this game again, I've noticed immediately that the developer has further polished what was already a great game: Lots of new skills and character feats, QoL UI changes and game mechanic balances, updated visuals and many new areas and quest-lines. It is more than worth the modest price tag on Steam--I cannot recommend it more for those looking for a strong, turn-based RPG set in a gloomy futuristic environment with many inspirations of cyberpunk design!",

            "review_text": "Very Fallout-esque with a few key differences off the top of my head: - Combat is very entertaining and rewarding. Expect to use all of your abilities and quickslot items to survive. Grenades, caltrops, special bolts, mid-fight healing.. All of it helps. Melee isn't the only option for stealth, since crossbows are included and ample within the game. Psi abilities for people that prefer wizard characters. - Choices and Consequences are not as impactful, but still there. - Skill Checks show fairly often for dialogue, and It's not only 'persuasion' that is considered. Checks are based on thresholds, not randomly generated. With pickpocketing, you can only grab so much, not save-scum your way to riches. - Attributes are much more specialized towards what kind of character you want to play. Every attribute has its use, but you're not rewarded any extra skill or action points for choosing Intelligence or Agility. - Skills points are sparse; you have to sacrifice defenses, social skills, or crafting even if you only specialize in a single combat skill.  - Feats and their requirements can all be displayed at the beginning of the game so you can plan accordingly. THERE ARE TONS, many being active skills and not simply passive boosts. - Companions do not exist. - Writing and humor are not as effective, but I have found myself chuckling here and there. - Crafting is extremely modular and well worth the skill points. You will not find the best equipment; crafting a stellar piece of armor will require investment into tailoring and mechanics. A good weapon will need mechanics and electronics. Feats can be chosen to further improve your creations.  I'm always a sucker for the gameplay, but the artist work is top-notch. Every non-transistion area is gushing with attention to detail and many are beautiful. As an example, they even spent the time to make character portraits change background depending on the area you are in. The soundtrack works very well with the setting.   10/10",

Does not hold your hand in game mechanics and solution solving that much, which is on most occations a good thing. One exception would probably be the Exitus puzzle, I figure many people ragequit from this one. Difficulty is extremly uneven, especially for your first unguided playthrough. I would rate this half a point below fallout 1+2. 8/10",

            "review_text": "Absolutely wonderful, played at least 6~ different builds and spent countless hours.  Before reading further I'll give you a TL;DR of my review  TL;DR: Probably one of the best isometric turn based fallout esque roleplaying experiences to date, interesting setting, countless dialogue choices, clever writing, conversations and events that change depending on what you have done as a player. This is one of the best games I have played in years.  **THE GOOD**  - Combat is insanely difficult: this is a game where it expects you to play smart and plan ahead or it gives you a rude awakening. This is the Dark Souls of isometric turn based RPGs. When you beat an encounter that seemed impossible it is extremely satisfying. Don't expect to waltz your way through even the simplest of encounters.  - Combat is varied: you can beat encounters with magic (psionic skills), traps (landmines and the like), melee, ranged combat, etc. With some skills you can make enemies fight each other, run away from you in fear while you hurl icebolts at them or avoid combat completely by using stealth. I'm not sure how much of the game you could complete without having to resort to combat, but I'd reckon you could stealth past 95% of content instead of fighting it.  - Oddity XP system: This is probably one of the most clever XP systems I've seen in an RPG, you are rewarded for finding oddities, items which when found reward a static amount of XP. You can find some oddities on the corpses of enemies, but most oddities are found by exploring the environment, breaking into locked doors and opening containers, basically you are rewarded for your skill build rather than only being rewarded for killing enemies. If this doesn't sound good to you don't fret, the game includes a classic XP system where you gain XP from killing enemies if you prefer that. With the Oddity XP system you will reach maximum level right around the end of the game.  - Crafting: I wasn't expecting an interesting crafting system when I bought this game, but I was surprised to see you can basically construct items and equipment for specific situations. All items are made of components, things like leather and fabric, and these leather and fabrics come in many varieties with bonuses exclusive to them. For example when you use kevlar cloth as your fabric then you will be more resistant to bullets, if you swap that out with black cloth instead you will recieve huge bonuses to stealth. Expect to always be on the look out for higher quality components as you play to improve your gear, even at the end of the game you are always finding better components.  - Story: I won't say much since I don't want to spoil anything, but there are multiple ways to proceed in the games main storyline, you can murder everyone in your path or ally yourself with the bad guys. In the end, its up to you and the choices you have made.  - Immersion: If you do things that would make you famous, character and NPCs will react realisticly to this. I once leveraged my importance as saviour of the town to get alone time with a prisoner in their private prison, little did the prison warden know I had ulterior motives and was actually there to silence this prisoner. But it's not just that, say I didn't convince the warden to let me see the prisoner.. I could've broken into the prison completely stealth and accomplished my goal that way, and you can even break this prisoner out of jail instead of killing him. There are multiple ways to tackle a lot of the quests in this game, which is what makes it so interesting and in my opinion a good game.  - The World: This is basically the Dark Souls of isometric RPGs in more ways than one, almost every area you explore seems to lead to two or even three more areas. It really feels daunting and endless, you can get lost in caverns, subway tunnels, and other places for hours. It is AMAZING. When you beat a quest that has you clearing out a dungeon for lack of a better word don't be surprised when you find two more paths that can lead to interesting places at the end of said dungeon. This game rewards exploration, and I'd almost say you're playing the game wrong if you don't spend hours exploring for the sake of exploring, especially with the Oddity XP system.  ** THE BAD **  No game is perfect, and I feel I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't share some of the things that might turn you off.  Difficulty: This is both the selling point of the game for me and its biggest problem. This is such an immense huge RPG and you won't even see but a fraction of it if you don't play the game right. Early on in the game is a quest which leads you to a place called Depot A for example, this place will rip you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you aren't ready for it, and you most likely are not ready for it. It took me hours to clear this place the first time I came here, I even had to make a new character because I realized my build wasn't combat oriented enough upon arrival here. The difficulty persists throughout the entire game, nothing is impossible but most encounters you run into will have to be avoided and returned to later when you are stronger. Some people may not like that, but it adds immersion to the world, you are not the biggest badass in the universe and the game lets you know, you can eventually become a power house but you will not be one for a very long time. I'm currently on my 5th character, and I think my odds of completing the game at this point are pretty good. But I rerolled a lot just to get to this point. You can spend skills wrong, you can make your character wrong, there is no respec available. Play carefully and plan ahead. With all this said, I'm playing on normal and there is an easy difficulty, hell there is even a hard difficulty...  Deep Caverns: Now I don't want to fuss too much about this place since it would be spoilers, but at the very end of the game there is a quite long section of the game which is so different from the rest of the game and so much harder than anything before it that it might just drive you mad. With that said you won't be anywhere near the end of the game for at least 20-40 hours.  ** IN CONCLUSION **  Do you like difficult isometric RPGs with heavy story and great writing?  Yes?  What are you waiting for?",

            "review_text": "All the most popular positive reviewers have spend about 20 hours ingame and were not even close to finish the game. But the people who gave the most helpful negative reviews did and thereby spend about 150 hours ...  First: besides the setting Underrail has not much in common with the old Fallout series. The NPCs are forgettable, the story underwhelming and the humor almost non-existent. The gameplay consists of mainly three parts:  - Most of the time is to be spend on safe scumming since you are fragile and weak throughout the game. Wrong dices mean an instant reload. Not seeing the mines scattered everywhere means an instant reload. Bumping into an enemy while sneaking means an instant reload. - Besides this, you will spend hours with with walking around. There's no map and the quick travelling possibilites are very limited, so you have to get to the next town and back by foot. - The rest of the time goes into the clunky vendor system.  In total the game does not reward your specialisation but punishes you for all the skills you did not invest in. On the other hand, a 'balanced' build will just fail in every regard and is no viable option either. I feel that this game is only enjoyable for hardcore gamers who seek challenges and won't get frustrated by trying over and over again. It's not like in Fallout where you where just miss stuff due to the drawbacks of your build. No, you will constantly die here, just because of everything. This is a game for min-maxer.  I appreciate the work and the heart the developers put into this game, and I value some innovations regarding the mechanics (i.e. the oddity system). But all in all it's neither interesting nor fun to play, just tedious. I feel sorry for voting it down, but I really can't recommend it.  Edit: Ye, I can see the irony of being top listed with far less then 100 ingame hours. But well, that was obviously not the case when I asked myself 'Will it ever become more enjoyable? Will my issues dissolve later on? Should I continue?' and therefore dediced to check out the (negative) reviews. I trust you still get my point.",

This will lead you to situations when you have s-hit load of guns, ammo, armor- but you cant sell it. Later in the game this will make looting almost pointless- you cant sell everything because traders have very small currency pool and will buy specific items in limited quantities. But what they DO buy will make more then enough money, which makes looting once again pointless. -Speech skills are almost pointless you can be just fine without them. They also requre much invesment, which you not always can afford. -Messed up character progression. You will be progressing mostly in skills and perks, while gear will stay mostly the same. It depends on your build though. Some characters will get jumps in power when they find certain unique weapons, while others will beat the game using the same weapon. You can get your weapon slightly better with crafting though.  -Overpowered stealth system that makes every encounter peace of cake. -Mines, mines everywhere.

            "review_text": "Sooo I don't have a whole lot of time in the game but enough to finish the first 5-6 missions. This game is abosolutly amazing. Imagine Shadowrun Hong Kong with everything you could ever want as far as skills and customizability. In a Fallout or Hellgate London setting. Much more like hellgate london than fallout IMO but either serves well to describe the feel and art of the world. Sound &amp; Music is pretty good although i'd reccommend playing with some dark music maybe NIN Ghosts album. Thats what I've been using and its spot on I love the combonation. As far as turn based RPG's this one takes the cake for me. If it had the graphics of Divinity or something this would be the game of the year. The graphics are primitive but serve their purpose. But there are things like gear peices showing up on your character as well as weapons so you can see your customizing on your character. Then theres the Psi abilities which are like mage &amp; chi power from shadowrun wrapped up into the same skill tree but within that tree there is 3 affinities. One for melee, one for ranged, mind control, and enviroment control (freezing, flame, ect.). And b/c the skills are so deep you can be a sniper with mind control or melee psi abilities. Its an aboslutely amazing game I'd reccommend it to anyone whose a fan of Shadowrun, Divinity, Pillars of Eternity, or X-Com. Its challanging and amazingly fun at the same time. My biggest advice is to do your missions spread your skills throughout a few trees. I'm going crossbow, pistol, sniper, psi, and melee with high affinities in science and crafting. Yes theres a craftin systems which is hugely in depth and amazing. reminiscent of WOW in ease of use. Collecting mats and creating things like armor, weapons, grenades, mines, ammo, consumables. All in all this game is AMAZING check it out. best 15$ i've spent this year.",

            "review_text": "Underrail has an immersive atmosphere, excellent character creation and growth, high multiple play through potential and will keep those players who have to search every nook and cranny busy for 100+ hours.  In short I would highly recommend the game to fans of the genre, if you enjoyed the early fallout games, Arcanum or even Balur’s gate, I would say with a high chance that you may enjoy this game too. It has a great story, great customisation, interesting characters and rewarding combat with interesting dynamics when it comes to planting traps and sneaking about. There are hundreds of doors and boxes to lock pick and hack, characters to meet and converse with and areas to explore, also some of the chat dialog options are awesome.   I would however be hesitant to recommend the game to people unknown to this genre, I feel the mainstream gamer would be betrayed by the issues in the late game section when the first ¾ of the game are very entertaining. Furthermore the black screen transitions between areas get tiresome very quick and make large connected areas like corecity feel sliced up and disjointed.   Upon entering the last section of the game, it feels like a call back to a bygone era of gaming where progressing through the plot is done by only the devoted few- you would hear of how to progress from those who had stuck through it or like some Nes games, go buy Nintendo Power and discover it wasn’t so straight forward as the rest of the game was. The last part of the game is unforgiving- not via combat as other may say(A stealthless character is not recommended!!), but with your time. If you were unlucky such as I, you will be walking back and forth for some time (granted I did it at 2x or 3x speed with an external program, explanation below) which adds up to poor gameplay. I was truly frustrated with the obscure late game plot quests (mainly the worm tunnel + spore jungle + powering the mutagen door, I made that journey about 8 times after selecting the wrong power) that I feel it has let the entire game down and will turn any new people to the genre away. If you’re patient however, the first ¾ of the game are great, the last ¼ not so much- but I did enjoy the boss battle and final wrap up- A good solid ending to a game means a lot to me and I was pleased with this game.  Thanks to the devs for making this game, it’s quite a rare experience and one that I very much enjoyed.. mostly (deep carverns i'm looking at you!)    ******************************************************************************* Technical issues and other stuff.  If you get mouse lag on full screen, I would highly recommend ‘Borderless Gaming’ a steam downloadable app which I got after almost giving up on this game… The program removed and fullscreened the games 1920*1080 window and removed the borders.. as described :D, also works with other programs, does a good job of it and is very light.  At around the 20 hour mark, I simply got fed up with travel times, it was starting to hurt my enjoyment of the game so I hunted for a program to speed up and slow down the game. After my first play through, I have negated 20 hours, of a 100 play time by simply speeding up and slowing walking around (Not exploring new areas-just getting from A to B).  (Calculated from steam game play time-100hours, vs borderless gaming play time 80 hours, ran them both always). Be prepared to walk everywhere, like I said- I cut out 20 hours of just walking.",

So let's look closely what make this game THAT much entertaining and unique:  -First thing comes by is atmosphere and design, maybe you'll say design is not that differ compare to other indie games, but one thing is really important is how detailed locations, specially city's, railroads, hidden facilities etc. Cities looks like a citys: corruption, oligarchy, bands, mercenaries, sectants. On the other side are mindless mutants, wild creatures, freaking robots, good lord, they got everything. -Scenario is a great, solid work. In our times it's become really hard to find one. Everything seems logic and on the place where it should be. Great dialogs, nothing seems to be forgotten and left for lazy hand. -Game mechanics, different ways of tactics, yes yes, not big mouthed lie from AAA game devs, here it's true. -One of the most important things for me is exploring, and here you'll find it at the finest, almost endless deep caverns, underground passages, metro ways. So much options, so much things to do, can't get enough of it. -Craft system just right how it's needed, not so easy one and not so overwhelming with needless details. -Fights provide accurate level of challenging. Which is very important.  For me it feels how devs inspired by other games, but took everything they like, cutted everything that was distrubing, added some extra from themselfs, and again made one gorgeous, uniqe, solid masterpiece.   Only one thing is missing is a map, atleast that one from underrail wiki with outlines, proved to be one hell of a useful.  Waiting for anythings, addons, new locations, campaigns, even new games, goodfkn luck.  And remember, there is no such thing as hard fight, there is not enough bear traps! :D",

Was fund yet challenging - can't just run into a group of baddies and start whacking, it takes some planning to survive. At one point I set up about 30 traps to be able to stop the goons coming at me. Bled those guys out with bear traps.  Crafting is an interesting part of the game. Hunt down the best quality parts and create the most awesome weapon or armor in the game. Or just skip that and spend a heap of coin instead, your choice. The economy in the game was a bit out of balance, I think, as my locker in the private quarters was always full of expensive weapons to sell, and I never ran out of money either.    Except for the Deep Caverns where money makes no difference whatsoever    Lovely, lovely game. I thoroughly enjoyed the 'just wander around in caves and see what you can find' style of playing.

            "review_text": "I've always really enjoyed Fallout 1 &amp; 2. With the emergence of Wasteland 2 a year ago I was able to experience another enjoyable open-world exploring, turn-based battle game system.  Underrail, which shares an unfortunate similar title to Undertale, has been a pleasant surprise. Here are some quick pros and cons:  Pros: +Fun battle system when you figure out its many nuances +Much larger than you'd think +Difficulty is mostly balanced, especially when you know what you're doing  Cons: -Very steep learning curve for all the systems -Sometimes overwhelming amount of info -hard to navigate since there is no map (as far as I can tell) -enemies can ofetn be obscured by the isometric angle making it difficult to aim or accidentally walking to them instead or shooting. Kind of wished the Fallout 2 red outline was implemented for visible targets.   To my understanding, one guy or a very small team made this, so props to them. The game's not perfect, but it recreates that addiciting quality Fallouts 1 and 2 had, despite their simplicity. As you can see, I've already put 40 hours into this game, playing with two different builds.  While this game tries to have the comedic timing of the other games, I didn't find the writing here to be overyly witty. There are a few funny moments, though.  Lastly, while the oddity system (a way of gaining EXP by doing quests and collecting oddities) is awkward at first, it's just fine. The creator also allows you to choose the classic style, where you kill to grow.  I think this game is well worth the asking price, if you know you're getting into an isometric, doesn't-hold-your-hand, open-world exploring, turn-based battle game. If not, it's not a bad introduction to the genre, but it will be very difficult at first.",

            "review_text": "A lot of fun, but 'Old School' hard.  There is actually a lot of interesting little game mechanics happening here. The amount of XP for killing enemies drops as you start to level up, forcing you in some ways to start looking out for the more dangerous prey just to keep moving forward level wise. Traders aren't junk dealers, well, except for the ones that are, and for the most part don't want that rubbish you are carrying. There are also a fair few interesting things happening with damage to make things a bit more than Hit Points and dead.  The game is also not going to hold your hand. You will be given missions but do not expect quest markers, glowing icons above NPCs of importance or even little updates part way through the quest to even let you know you are doing the right thing. Even knowing if you are on the right map is going to require you to pay attention and work things out.  The main quests slowly level as part of what I am assuming is the overall story arc. Side quests pop up from time to time if you talk to enough people but for the most part are linked to what you are trying to do anyway. At time of writing I believe I have progressed maybe 1/4 of the way through, possibly less, and can't really talk about the middle/end of the game. You are allowed to explore to some extent but the game is in no means an open world sandbox and some parts of the starting map are blocked off with rock falls that you lack the equipment to move until later.  On the down side I did mention this game is Old School hard. Combat is turn based and if you get in over your head you are likely to be swamped and killed before you can get out of it. On the flip side thinking up creative ways to defeat your enemies can be very rewarding. Having been kerb stomped by one enemy three times in a row, I finally defeated him by first throwing in a molotov and then following up straight away by entangling him with a net so he could gain the full enjoyment of standing in fire for several turns. Unfortunately with other combats I have only been able to succeed by entering a map, taking one round of damage from the multiple enemies that are still there waiting for you, shooting once and then exiting the map to heal before doing it again, and again, until you finally manage to kill enough of the buggers to make it a slightly more managable one on one.  The game is also a bit unforgiving if you don't follow the 'correct' path on the skill tree. Many areas include air vents that you can, one assume, enter and crawl around, successfully by passing the bigger and badder enemies on the level. I assume as your character needs a high enough Lockpick skill to get the vents open in the first place and I have never been able to increase my skill enough to get a vent open.  Also don't ask me how the crafting system works. There seems to be a lot of crafting you can do, just not with my skill base. There are actually a fair few combat related skills I do seem to be needing to constantly increase thank you very much Mr Game Designer so I can't skill up everything.  However if you can get over the fact you are going to die alot and are willing to accept that you do need to PAY ATTENTION (one side quest involves    you having to answer questions about an area you might have casually passed through a couple of playing hours ago for a man who is trying to spy on the place. What? You mean you didn't take notes early?!   :P ) then you will have an entertaining little old school RPG with some interesting world building and backstory.",

The map is HUGE, and will keep you busy for 40+ hours.   - The game mechanics are very well-balanced, allowing for a lot of different builds.  - Innovative optional XP system that revolves around exploration and looting, rather than killing.  - Graphics and sound are effective and fit the concept.  Downs:  - The final chapter is ridiculously complex, and about half as long as the rest of the game by itself. Just when you're ready to finish the game and move on, you're presented with an incredibly vast labyrinth filled with powerful enemies. You also have to complete a tedious scavenger hunt mission throughout the area, then fight the final boss. This sector alone has made me never want to do another playthrough.  - While the game presents many different build options, you'll soon find that the game forces you into certain builds. Hacking, stealth, and lockpicking are borderline essential, and you better hope you have some way of piercing armor when fighting the final boss. Conversely, the speech-related skills are borderline useless.  - You will die. A lot. Expect about one-quarter to one half of your time to be save scumming.  - Some weird programming glitches now and then. For example, some of the sounds are on different channels, causing some sounds to go through headphones and others to go through onboard speakers. Also, the game seems to refresh its window with every area transition. Nothing game-breaking, but mildly annoying.  - The barter system is very frustrating. Merchants will only buy a certain amount of specific items on each visit, so you'll quickly find yourself cycling the various towns just trying to offload your loot.",

Underrail has a pretty decent story (something along the lines of Metro and Fallout), and the gameplay and character building is one of the most fun I've had in a game. I built a melee psionic bruiser that just punched his way through the entire game.   There are two ways you can progress in levels in this game and they are oddity or classic. Oddity is a really interesting idea where you gain experience from finding unique items from monsters or looting through junk (The way I played), and then there's the other way that most gamers are probably familiar with which is classic (where you beat up people or monsters and gain exp). Either playstyle works very well depending on your interest.  The game progresses very well and it never felt like I had to grind my way to progress. This game is a must play even at full price, but if you can get it during a sale, please do! It is one of the most fun and enjoyable games I've ever played! Totally support this developer!

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: UnderRail is not a 'spiritual' Fallout sequel, is  nothing  like the original Fallout franchise, and (while a good game) can't hold a candle to either of the original Fallout titles. Don't let the 'member berries of other reviewers talk you in to picking this up solely for nostalgia's sake. Both Fallout and UnderRail are turn-based post-apocalyptic RPG's, but that is where the similarities end.   Edit - As a final aside, the end of UnderRail can be extremely tedious, depending on what story-related actions you did/did not take during the course of your playthrough. I'm setting UnderRail aside for now, and I'm not certain if I'll ever finish it. That sucks, but I certainly cannot say that I didn't get my money's worth.   ---------------------------------------------  UnderRail is a good (not great) game, and a worthwhile purchase - especially at (or below) the current sale price of $7.49. As is my habit, I'm going to skip giving you the 'pros' (because the reviews are canvassed with 'em), and just provide folks with the bad (and often infuriating) 'cons' of UnderRail. Straight to it:      Combat is slow, and stilted. You'll see other reviewers complaining about their high offensive and defensive stats not getting them the desired results. That's because the NPCs do in fact get way more actions a turn than you, and they have their own combat-affecting stats. Beyond that, their gear will alter your chance to hit, range, etc. based on those item stats - and there is zero way for you to know how their gear is ♥♥♥♥ing your combat percentages until you're stripping it from their lifeless corpse. You will miss more shots, and take more hits than you expect. Every. Single. Combat.     'UnderRail doesn't hold your hand.' As usual, this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t old-timerese for 'the game devs had no idea how to teach their game in an intuitive and immersive manner, so they just throw you to the wolves.' (It's okay, fellow old ♥♥♥♥s, I'm 32 and just barely qualified for that statement to be self-deprecating.) Just be prepared to have the wiki open at all times, at least beyond the ten hour mark. Think of it as sitting down with a strat guide in the old days, because you knew any worthwhile RPG was going to be missing gobs of vital information and be completely obtuse in what it did explain.     No map, no world map, no overlay, nothing. This is one of those things that artificially inflates the difficulty of a game, that other old-timers insist makes the game 'hardcore' or 'retro.' Well, all that is garbage. It's just frustrating and there's no need for it.     Along those lines - There's no way to respec your character. Again, my fellow fogies will tell you that 'you can't achieve victory if you cannot actually fail.' ♥♥♥♥ that. This game is good, but it's the same every playthrough, and there's nothing compelling enough about it to make you want to re-roll a fresh character even after the first time you mismanage your stats and end up with a bum toon. Do NOT feel bad referencing the wiki for builds before you start, otherwise you're very likely to kill your enjoyment of this game.     Item management HELL. Certain vendors only sell certain items of certain types, and buy even fewer items of those types. Getting a good bankroll going is a big pain, and maintaining your inventory (and gear) as you level only gets more intricate, not less. Especially once the game adds additional currencies. Be ready to spend a fair amount of time running from floor to floor of each town, desperately trying to find enough vendors to unload some loot on. Then do it again when you're ready to stock up for another outing.   ---------------------------------------------  All that said, I am still happy with my purchase, and my playtime. Like any other turn-based RPG, you can take UnderRail at your own pace. That means you have as much time as you need to adjust to the steep curve, and get a good handle on it. And it's worth it. UnderRail is pretty, has a decently strong narrative (a bit spotty on lore, though), tons of character and atmosphere, and also has several phenomenal systems in place that allow you to create and customize a character that is truly yours.  If UnderRail were a book, it would certainly be a classic - Well worth the read, but only if you're prepared to deal with being slowed down by antiquated structure and the creators assumptions on what knowledge and understanding you're equipped with prior to sitting down at the table.   For those of you looking for a similar, but more contemporary, experience; I can't recommend  Satellite Reign  enough, although I would definitely advise most people to wait on a sale/price drop, since $29.99 is pretty steep for a game of this type.",

However the possibilities for the player are often limited and the progress feels stretched. The game could have used a higher budget to mitigate these deficiencies but in the end offers a good price for plentiful content.  Underrail is set in a postapocalyptic world, where people are based around former railroad tunnels because the surface is no longer accessible. While this, on first glance, seems to limit the gameworld, it really is pretty large with many tunnels, caves, stations and underground rivers to explore and even get lost in. However a lot of the places are not interesting, just filled with repetetive enemies and mostly there to keep you busy till you get to somewhere else.  As the player you have a relatively high degree of freedom to take quests or leave them and to work for one or another faction in some places. The writing and options in the quests is somewhat lacking and generally follows typical tropes.  Character creation offers a variety of distinct choices in gameplay, be it stealth, talkative, relying on melee, ranged or psi abilities. There is a lack of tutorial on how to skill your character and I had to restart early on because I felt I had too many problems winning fights. After that I was happy with my casting type character. While there were too many fights overall, i kept getting challenged throughout the game. The fights are turn based and use an action point system, that gives you time and opportunities to plan the use of your character's abilities. I generally like such a system for controling a party, but in Underrail you only ever control your own character. I did not expect the combat in this game to be very entertaining, but it was. This did develop as the character kept gaining new abilities.  While there are obvious comparisions to make to other games like for example fallout 1,2, Underrail is significantly different enough to warrant a distinct experience. I wish the game had been less ambitious in scope and more focused in detail, but in regards to its price I could not expect more.",

But so far Ive found the rest of the game strikes a great balance of difficulty. In comparison, I find recent Bethesda RPG games like Fallout 4 difficulty to be bland and the game mechanics to be oversimplified.  Having read some steam reviews I went in with these expectations, which was important: 1) The game starts out with a high difficulty. There is not much hand holding. 2) There is no map and no quest markers, so you have to take mission notes like directions out of game.  Building a character, I felt a bit shoehorned into some specific bulids because of how the synergies work, but overall Ive been very pleasently suprised by how fun the character building and leveling is.  This is an RPG carrying the torch of fallout 1 and 2, while innovating and being completely its own thing. It is a deep game, with an open world ready to be explored.",

My qualms with Underrail are the limited number of approaches you can take in certain situations. It's like combat situations oscillate between 'do-able by placing traps around the vicinity and tactfully choosing your combat utilities' and 'If you can't tank this part, you're screwed' To some the cavalcade of enemy types you confront mission-to-mission might keep the game fresh, but in my run it's resulting in traveling back and forth to hubs to buy specific utilities from vendors for the next slice of the mission, and without the foresight of a second playthrough I end up ill-equipped infuriatingly often and sitting through the dodgy pathfinding to get back to to those hubs. This one point in the main quest really got my hopes up,    when you're opening the burrower nest in the warehouse, and can get the card key by getting the looters' attention before locking yourself in the security control room and activating the turrets    but since then the moments where puzzles weren't solved by dumping money into enemy-specific combat utilities have been sparse, to say the least. Odds are good I'm going to finish a playthrough eventually and maybe I'll be singing a different tune, but for the moment I'm spending too much time pacing the path between my current objective and the nearest hub to recommend this to anyone.",

            "review_text": "The ONLY reason I have as many hours on this game as I do is because I restarted numerous times because I figured I was getting something wrong about character management or crafting or missing content somewhere. I'm not. The game is fundamentally flawed and isn't very fun to play. Basically the game devolves into save-spamming and retrying things until you find the one exact right combination of actions that can get you to move forward.  Clearly, the sole author of this game had a design 'philosophy' of 'I haven't created a situation that requires this particular skill to be maxed so I need to do that now.' Basically you wind up restarting the game from scratch 5 or 6 times creating a character that meets that exact situation, only to discover that you didn't spend all of your points on another skill required to advance so you restart and try again and get bored of repeating the same starter content over and over over...  Combat is absolutely rediculous. Never mind the 'I am stuck moving 5 tiles at a time because I made the mistake of getting into combat once in this room with a creature that had no xp value and doesn't even appear to be present anymore' aspect. The unbalanced nature of combat (think 5 vs 1, they have machine guns you have a butter knife) is pervasive even in 'easy' mode. Some scenarios are just flat-out unwinnable even if you currently restarting the game with a 'pure combat' character design.  The crafting system is absurd. You can make neat stuff--but never be able to use it because you spent all of your skill points being able to make neat stuff. Hey, great I just made a machine gun that will miss 99% of the time. What's the point of that?  Any of the above would be no problem for almost all RPGs. Can't do an area? No problem, find another area and level up or go grind for XP. Sorry, you can't do that in this. Area progression seems really, really linear and you can go from 'OK I have the exact right set of skills to win combat here' to 'I just got ambushed by things I couldn't even hit once' just by crossing a single screen. The only creatures that seem to respawn are useless 'critter' type things that yield minimal XP. I'm sure it will be lots of fun waiting for 87 rats to spawn to make it from level 7 to 8.   Even you were insane enough to want to grind out XP in this way it's ultimately self-defeating. Every combat action either expends ammo or durability. Since both of these items are limited resources (durability via repair kits) which you don't find on creatures then you will eventually exhaust one or the other and then not be able to do combat at all.  The 'stealth' aspect is equally useless and ultimately self-defeating. Stealth in this game allows you to [possibly] walk by some enemies (but not cameras or turrets) but provides absolutely no combat use. Stealth ends when combat begins. You can re-enter stealth in combat but I can't see a reason for this because apparenlty the entire level knows of your existence until the end of time once combat is entered. If you use stealth to bypass enemies you gain no experience (in either 'classic' or 'oddity' XP mode since about 1/2 of oddities drop from dead enemies.)",

            "review_text": "CURRENT REVIEW:  I decided to give this game another shot after playing it in Early Access late 2014. I think the developer has made some crucial improvements. For instance, you can actually change key binds now. Now that I've played further into the game, I can relate my current experience to some of my initial impressions.  Underrail is seriously difficult, but often not in a way that can be considered a challenge to overcome. Rather, the game compels you to conform to a certain way of playing it. At first glance, the ability and skill system seems as if it offers great diversity. However, most character builds will not work. High perception attribute and/or trap skill are pretty much mandatory for detecting mines, which otherwise will kill you without warning, forcing you to save scum. If you decide not to play a stealthy character, you must be very careful not to enter an enemy's aggro radius without initiating combat first or having very high agility and dexterity. Combat is typically won or lost by who can keep the enemy stunned, so it's extremely important to get the initiative in combat and make stunning the enemy the first move, because otherwise they will stun you and you will lose.  This game is gruelingly slow-paced. I have already put in close to 70 hours and I feel like I've only gotten started. This wouldn't be a problem if you could encounter interesting characters or situations. They're few and far between, believe me. The rest of it is quite shallow. I am also somewhat disenchanted by the lack of choice in questing around. As far as sidequests go, you can pretty much only choose to engage them or not. If you choose not to, you of course get no experience. When playing the oddity experience mode, the only ways to get experience are by finding oddities and completing quests. This makes it feel like you aren't progressing if you choose not to do side quests either for RP reasons or just because you don't want to as a player. Speaking of which, the RP element in Underrail is quite flimsy, since most interactions with NPCs are static no matter what you choose to do. Back to the point, you end up doing quests not because you want to, but because you want that sweet xp, which is so hard to come by.  One of the only things I do like about this game is the tension caused by having an expansive maze-like world to explore without a map. It's kind of exciting.  Unfortunately, I still don't recommend this game. It gives literally zero forks about you having an enjoyable experience.    EARLY ACCESS REVIEW (November 2014):  While I do think this game has decent potential, it seems nowhere near a finished product. Because this game is early access, my 'not recommended' evaluation is tentative. I will watch how this game develops and hopefully I will be able to revise my recommendation.  The Good: - Post-apocalyptic subterranean environment - You get to loot stuff! - Quite challenging right from the start - Solid turn-based combat - The graphics are pretty nice to look at  The Bad: - Somewhat clunky controls for dialogue and combat - Difficult to click on some environmental objects and enemies - No key binding configuration - Screen panning with the mouse has issues on a dual monitor setup - UI elements are tiny pixel graphics - Tons of text to read, all in very small pixel font  The Unfortunate: - From what I've experienced so far, NPCs seem lifeless and uninteresting. For 'important' NPCs you get a decent amount of dialogue options, but the characters themselves have all the personality of a block of tofu.",
