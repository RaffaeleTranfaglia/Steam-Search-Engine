            "review_text": "This game is good... but very short. If you liked the first game, you'll probably enjoy this game for about two hours. But after a certain point if you pay any real attention to your characters, it quickly becomes a disgusting stomp-fest for the entirety of the rest of the -very short- game. I got to the final boss and just kind of stared at the screen waiting for it to tell me that it wasn't actually over, as it happened in the first one, only for the credits to roll and end the game. Ultimately this game feels way less fulfilling than the first, and I don't think it's really worth the money. I would've given this a positive recommendation if it was even close to the length of the first. This feels like less of a sequel and more of an expansion.  EDIT: Decided to go a bit more indepth in my review after thinking on it a bit.  Good: -Funny, just like the first. Lots of jokes, although some are very repetitive. -Good fun for about two hours, until you start reaching various caps and it quickly becomes very tedious and dull. -Yeah that's pretty much it, aside from 'nostalgia' for the first game, nothing unique about this game stands out.  Bad: -Crafting is almost pointless. The only large use for it is 'enchanting' gear, which is very minimal and caps out at +3 total very quickly. In addition, you get very few crafting recipes, most of which are for very basic consumables. -Item purchases cap out very quickly as well. I had reached my maximm possible purchasable items well before halfway into the game, and I kept waiting for more to unlock but sadly none ever did. -Going back to crafting, it heavily favors the melee characters, since you can't really boost trinkets, and the only available +spellpower weapon was an already enchanted staff. Meanwhile you can enchant melee weapons to the nines and deal truckloads of damage. I gave my paladin some huge +3 weapons and he just started one-shotting things. -'Unique' items end up being much worse than crafted ones, therefore making it almost better to sell any interesting items. Like the three-handed sword. I enchanted a +3 waraxe and it had significantly better stats than an Item I had just gotten at the same level, and for 1 hand less requirement. I ended up selling almost every unique item I received, including most of the debuff-immunity ones due to the fact that most of the time debuffs will simply fall off your characters without accomplishing much. -Very repetitive. While the first game was bad about this as well, the 'grinding' of that game had some kind of purpose. Hunting for grindstones and whatnot was necessary unless you paid $$. In this game by the end you just end up walking halfway cross the map and back repeatedly, and when you get there killing maybe 2-3 waves of monsters, repeat. -Unbelievably short game. I have about a 90% completion on this game, I went out of my way to do most of the side quests, and it only took me 6.5 hours to complete. I doubt I'd get much more than an hour more out of doing the little remaining content, maybe an additional half hour on that if I fork over the additional 4.99 in-game dlc. -No seriously, I cannot stress enough how short this game is. KoPaP 1 was fairly long for that type of game, and you went significantly higher in levels. At the beginning of the game you see a level 99 character, and I figured that would be close to what endgame looked like. Instead, you pretty much finish the game at level 20, possibly earlier if you skip side quests. This was an extreme let down. -Classes, while interesting, require very little in terms of creation. Most of the classes you can be well served simply by levelling 1 or 2 of their skills and all but ignoring the others. I never put more than 1 rank into about 75% of the skills and just capped others with impunity, especially all the 'affect adjacent' ones combined with the gameroom item to make them effect all. -In addition, I never could find a retraining system to try and re-work my characters if I wanted to test out diferent builds, so short of starting up a new game I just had to stick with my decisions. -Severe lack of gameroom items. In the first one you almost had too many options, this time when you open up to buy gameroom items and you see only 2 or 3 in each section (with 5 slots 'open') it's an immediate let-down.  All in all, this feels like a game only half-finished and just tossed out for some quick fan-cash. They had enough name-recognition to get people to buy it, and decided to use that to just coast on a barely completed product. I didn't personally encounter any bugs, but I heard there were a great deal when the game first released, and that only makes me more sure that this product is yet another in the current trend of 'finish half the game, and then sell the rest of it as DLC.'  I would not recommend this to anyone, not even fans of the original.",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game, but only barely.  For me, the real issue is that there just doesn't seem to be enough content to fill out the containers they created for features. Whether it's classes, or playable characters, or places to explore, or craftable recipes, or skill options and diversity. Just as an example of this, the first few times you manage to roll a perfect 20 while traveling you will find an enjoyable event. But after that, nah. They just didn't create more than a couple. It's like someone checked the boxes for all of these features the community wanted or was brought over, but just didn't commit to building them out in a way that the player can enjoy for very long.  The only reason I can give this a recommend safely is that you will get 10+ hours of enjoyment out of it for 10 dollars. That's a decent value. But it could have been a lot better.",

            "review_text": "I love the first game, but I didn't like this one at all.   It's extremely short, tedious and sometimes boring. I did everything, including the 'DLC' and I wasn't satisfied at all.  Let me give you this breakdown:  *Crafting: I am not a fan of crafting at all in videogames, and this one wasn't an exception. You can craft some items and enchant items, but the enchanting is underwhelming, since you can make an item either +1 or +2 or +3, no special bonuses or making them powerful afterwards. Any unique items you find on the field won't be better than your enchanted items. Also, I got the feeling crafting was added, since all other games have crafting.  *Quests: This goes for both main story and side quests. ALL of them are either 'Go to that place and fetch this' or 'Kill X number of monsters'. There is only one variety, and that is a 'mystery' quest, where you 'investigate' a place and of course by 'investigating', I mean click those options and see what happens. Yeah, the first game had the first two, but here, to the sequel of that game, I was expecting more variety, more quests, bigger, longer, better. But no, we got nothing.  *Gold: I wasn't sure how to write it down, but another thing you will face toward the end, is you have nowhere to spend gold. I got all availible Game Room items (by the time I write this, BTW), I crafted and enchanted a good gear and everything from the two Magazines, including the 4.99 'DLC' and Monk, and then you get more gold and there is nothing you will spend it on. At the end of the main story + 'DLC', I had over 2000 gold and they were sitting over there.  *Conditions: The worst part of the combat of this game. Attacks can cause stun, confusion, bleeding, burning, poison etc status effects, but 99% of the times they work against you, since the enemies will get rid of it either immediately or at the beginning of the turn with a save roll. Also, in some places you have special conditions that also work against you, like in Big Town the special effect is MOB and each round there is a 25% chance a Thief will appear as your enemy. Or in the Tower of Broken Balance, the effect there called Broken Balance, the enemies do +25% damage, while you do -25% damage. They are useless and against the player. Also, how can someone achieve Sudden Death at all, when all everything you cast are gone almost immediately.  *Length: It's an extremely short game. My play time, that is I was sitting and playing, should be lower than what Steam says, due to some RL stuff I was doing. And if you don't do the 'DLC' quests, your play time will be even shorter. And the places you explore are fewer than the first game. The only thing it might add some time are the investigations you can do in each area, but those can be done in 1 minute. And they add nothing, since they are either items you can buy from the stores, or some unique items you won't use or recipes for items you won't make at all.  I will say the writing is good, with some good jokes but it won't save it from being a subpar from the first game. And I see they will release DLCs in the future, but after I beat 100% of the availibt content, I won't return back to it.",

            "review_text": "So far a terrific game; however, pales in comparison to it's predecessor in content and enjoyment.  It's very short, and seems a little less challenging. Overall great. But the price, being more expensive than the first game, for much less content seems a little out there. Hopefully they keep adding to this game to make it as fun as KP&amp;P 1. And hopefully they don't decide to blast the hell out of it with microtransactions to access this content.  In the end it's worth the buy if you get it on sale.  Also, devs, if you are reading this, for the MILLIONTH time, please, for the love of God and all that is holy: Add a feature to Knights of Pen and Paper 1 on mobile to CHOOSE AND LOCK SCREEN ORIENTATION. It's such a simple feature, and it would solve many a headache for people like me I'm sure.  Also for KP&amp;P 2, the randomized dungeons are ok; but, it seems strange that you can't just click on the room you want to go to unless you are adjacent to it. It's pointless to make you revisit every previous room for no reason other than to move on. I've played other games with a similar style dungeon and their saving grace was allowing you to skip redundant room travel and just move on to where you haven't yet been.",

It made pop culture references both old and new, sighed wistfully about the good old days, and made many jokes. Speaking of jokes, this game deconstructs every RPG cliché in the book. No main story quest ends the way you'd expect it to, and by my count, there are three, including the 'Here be dragons' expansion. There are also many sidequests to flesh out each main story by giving the NPC's some love.  Grinding is optional. If you do all the quests before moving on, you'll be strong enough to handle the dungeons and bosses. The dungeons test your endurance, but that's easily solved by crafting enough HP and MP potions. The crafting system becomes much easier if you make 1 of each item to compare them.  Character roles and classes are straightforward and easy to unlock just by playing the game to gather enough gold. As with the crafting system, knowing which role/class to use becomes much easier by trying each at least once. I recommend focusing on only 1 or 2 skills per character. Evenly spreading your skill points around all 4 skills is a bad idea for almost every class.  Certain classes complement each other very well. You can swap out classes without losing levels, redistribute skill points, or even delete characters altogether.  Try this game if you like retro RPG's!",

            "review_text": "Got this game in the recent humble bundle. You control a group of DnD players who is playing through a DnD tabletop game with a gamemaster telling the story.  The main draw of this game is its witty writing, together with tons of tongue in cheek references of gaming cliches (i.e. town guard complaining they need more time to power-level to be able to fight off the bandit attacks). This style of writing carries the game from the start till the finish.   The length of the main storyline is around 11+ hours which is actually just about right as there is hardly a moment where I think the game is getting boring (finished the main story in like 3 settings, after which there are additional sidequests/dungeons which I've yet to play).  The turn based battle system of this game is fun as well, and not too complicated which is a good thing. There is also a basic crafting system. You can choose your party of five from any combination (each granting you different abilities) of high school character-types(Lab Rat, Cheerleader, Rocker, Surfer, Rich Kid to name a few), race (human, elf, dwarf), and classes (like thief, wizard, warrior, priest, ninja which is what I have for my main party). Other classes you can use are paladin, hunter, warlock, barbarian, druid, monk.  I also enjoyed the soundtrack alot, it's the sort of old-school midi type of music and there is a different music track for each of the different background settings you are in, personal favourite is the oriental track.  Overall, I feel it's a really great little rpg. While it may not have epic length and complicated game play. It made up for those with its great humour and addictive gameplay.",
