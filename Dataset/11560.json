    "description": "In the space of fifty years, Earth changed from a planet on cusp of a challenging future to a world a breath away from lifelessness and plunged into an apocalyptic time of ecological disaster, global warfare and the meltdown of human civilization. This is the time of the Maelstrom.",

            "review_text": "Good: very unique, fun gameplay that I havent seen in an RTS before. AI can build your base for you while you focus on the combat. the three races are suprisingly different from one-another. The terrian is dynamic, and can be manipulated to build walls, ditches, and foxholes.  Bad: Some players need to use a glitch just to get to the main menu. Everyone in the game moves at half the speed of smell. One of the races (ascension) has a completely broken AI. Ascension takes forever to get the cool units. The direct control ability, where you take direct control of a hero unit as a third-person shooter is god-aweful. The most important resource, water, takes forever to get despite most of the battles taking place near the ocean.  Conclusion: an interesting game with too many flaws to make it 'good' Definitely worth picking up if you can find it for cheap. Anything over $5 is too much. ",

            "review_text": "While this game does have some interesting things they tried to do, I feel that it has lost in some of the most basic elements of an RTS. Whether this is a result of lack of polish or overemphasis on a few key features, the result is a game that just feels weak. Leaving aside cinematics, vocals and dialog, from the very beginning, the command UI feels frustrating. There is no feeling of control over an engagement; your infantry will wander around and do whatever they want. They'll watch complacently while a teammate is mowed down five feet away, and one guy will take a jog around three sides of a building to rejoin the squad after you moved them to an adjacent corner. Any attempt at strategy is pointless, and blobbing soldiers is really the only thing you can do. The game's age isn't an excuse; there are many games much older than this one that have better playability. The Ground Control series comes to mind.",
