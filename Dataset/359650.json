It also makes it easier (for simple folks) to load and play. I have the originals but to get everything in place to work. The hand drawn art is a thing of beauty. Everything has the familiar look and the voice acting wasn't 'phoned' in so it feels geniune. The 8 espiodes in the game have a original series narrative to it so it's like a lost season. Judgement Rites is the same way. BTW keep the map handy, I forgot you need it to get from point A to point B! Otherwise, you'll get to enjoy the outnumbered ship to ship battle to the pain!",

            "review_text": "Still one of the best Star Trek games ever released, but it's both less expensive and compatible with more OS platforms if you buy it through GOG instead of Steam.   Regardless of where you buy it from if you want a game that captures the feel of classic Star Trek this is a great one. This is my first time playing it in over twenty years and first time playing it with the full voice acting by the original actors, that extra touch really adds a lot.",
