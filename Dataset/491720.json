            "review_text": "I really like the idea of Nary and think it could really be a fun game, however when I tried to play the game, the button layout was very crowded and unnartural. I found myself paying too much attention to my hands and their positioning and less time enjoying myself. I think that implementing controller support would really benefit Nary, in which case you could either change the z, x, c promps to display , for example, as X, Y, B for xbox controllers, or Square, Triangle, and Circle for Playstation controllers.",
