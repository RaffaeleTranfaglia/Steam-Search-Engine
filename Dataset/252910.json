Now, you may ask, 'then why did you recommend this game if you dislike it?'.  Well, when I said 'except one thing', I was speaking about the soundtrack. This game has the most amazing soundtrack I have ever heard. The game itself is quite silly, and there's not a lot of fun to be had in it, but honestly, if it's on a sale or something, buy it for dirt cheap, download it, and just listen to the soundtrack. I bloody love it!  In conclusion, the game isn't worth the price, but the soundtrack is!",

In the beginning you are dealing with multi-storey town houses, but later on you find yourself in realizing magnificent buildings for the rich and famous. A level is considered to be solved, if, within the specified time, the received contracts and tasks have been fulfilled.   During the game the player receives more and more new tools, machines and experience points. On the hunt for the high score, the game can be played with friends too.",

            "review_text": "'0.2/10' According to My Own Rating. Fails to deliver what is promised in the game description. The only 'feature' they promised and delivered was the intuitive control. The navigation is pretty much the default for 3d software.  Incomplete. Not a work in progress. Not an early access. It's simply a pre-alpha quality release being sold as a final product. Typos, bugs, endless crashes. Not Steam quality standard.   You can hire extra engineers, but can't get them to do anything. The development was aborted before that. You have a tooltip they call a tutorial on description. But it explains what they planned to develop, not what they actually did. You can sell your skyscraper. And sometimes you'll be able to buy it back for the original land value... and sell again for the skyscraper value... and repeat... If for some reason the game sells you two vehicles with the same name, your save file is wasted. the game will crash when you try to sell or move the vehicle or when the building process is over.  For ages 6 and below. Not challenging. One of the only simulator games where anyone that can read will probably get everything right since the first attempt. If you sell your buildings, you'll get rich. If you rent them out, you'll get rich. You can just set the price to maximum and ensure maximum profits. Nothing to calculate, no need for operations research. Any building will sell for maximum price within one year. And you can't build a new one faster than that anyway... no need to hurry then. If you set the rent out price to the maximum, you'll get the maximum sale value every 4 years. You'll start slower, but will build up steady income faster (exponential income growth). You can use your steady income to ensure you won't run out of money when investing more than you have.  As a matter of fact, your only job is to allocate workforce and machinery. Too bad that's about half a thousandth of the skyscraper building costs. In other words, you can fail pathetically and will still look successful.  For some reason, you can rent out your skyscraper as soon as it's about 20% done constructing (60% total building time). That means you only need money enough for 60% of the building process. From that point on, the rent will give you more than you can possibly spend on its construction.  No maps or modding. No scripting to fix their bugs. Simulators really need modding capabilities. Especially if the developers decide not to finish the game before (or after) selling.  Only worth buying if it has a 98% off discount. The only two challenges in the game are: 1 - Play for one hour without quitting out of boredom or having the game crash. 2 - Try to have fun playing this. Your role is irrelevant. There is no real challenge. 3 - Go bankrupt without intentionally cutting all your revenue streams.  TL;DR: the official game screenshots will bring you more challenge and fun than the actual game. They've worked harder on them than the development.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game to play with my 6 year old son, who loves construction vehicles and skyscrapers, and it's easy enough for him to play on his own. What little gameplay exists is very simple and repetitive; there is no escalation of difficulty at all, and hardly any variety. You're pretty much just going to watch skyscraper after skyscraper being built. It seems like there's potential for a much better game based on what's here, but as it is this doesn't feel complete. Still my son did get a kick out of it, so maybe a recommendation if you have small kids who love construction vehicles, but otherwise this just isn't a very good game.",

Gameplay is fairly simple, dividine a workforce across 5 different types of machines, moving machines across jobsites, and moslty just waiting for a job to complete.  Honestly, there are facebook and flash games(Corporation Inc. from armor games) that are more rewarding and exciting.  If you can get it for the same 16 cents I got it for, go for it, otherwise go play Corporation Inc. ",

            "review_text": "So, I bought this game expecting it to be kindof underwhelming, even as someone who likes management games. Unfortunately, it didn't even match my lowered expectations.   Initially, I thought I could have input into the skyscraper's design; fiddle with floorplans and construction methods and so forth. What I got was 3 arbitrary choices for sky scraper design and 4 slider bars to tweak quality/quantity/type of rooms in the building, and the number of floors. That's it.   At this point I thought 'oh well, maybe they make up for this with complex and engaging mechanics in management of the actual construction. I could dig that.' What I expected now was a game with plenty of 'make sure this resource is managed well' and 'hire/fire staff as needed', but also a game with slightly complex decisions like choosing companies to contract with, or buying resource sources. Also random events, and a solid progression as described of 'start with multistory houses, and work up to mega skyscrapers'. What I got was a game of 'hire/fire people as needed. that's it.'  By the time I finished the tutorial/learning process (completed one skyscraper), I decided I'd build another. I maxed the speed the whole time, and found myself entirely and utterly bored. This isn't really a game so much as an add-on for some other, non-existant game with the other 90% of the process. I am generally not critical of games, but this game is only worth a dollar or two as it stands. These simulator games seem to be turning out to be a money grab, rather than a genuine simulator. Much less a fun game.",

That you are going to have some control over what you do right? NO, NO, NO.  Listen to this: All you do in this game is watch. That is right. You can assign workers by clicking on arrows.....thats it, u click on arrows....and u watch as they build default buildings....u cant choose what the building can be, u cant do anything but watch. just watch numbers and images changing. i give this game 0/10. I think thats the only game that holds such grade in my book. Not only because it is trash but because it misleads the buyer. Plain and simple garbage.",

This is a blatant lie; in reality it is an 'not responding' window simulator. When you first load up the game, you are greated by a series of company logos; Developer, Publisher, etc. Then as the last logo fades to black, with much fanfair absolutly nothing happens. The screen remains blank. The Steam overlay freezes in place, and the game stops responding.  The issue lies not in my hardware. My i7-4790k, gt740, and 16GB of ram well exceed the minimum specifications. The issue lies purely in this peice of software(search online, many people suffer the same affliction).  As far as I can find, there is no fix. The game is broken and in an unplayable state. I would strongly recommend not purchasing 'Skyscraper Simulator', save your $10USD for something else.  TL;DR Pros: -A dang fine black screen before it crashes.  Cons: -Lacks any kind of depth/gameplay in its current state, because it does not work.  Other Thoughts: I am used to Early Access games being flawed, however this is beyond that. This is by-far the most broken Early Access games in my library of 400 games.",
