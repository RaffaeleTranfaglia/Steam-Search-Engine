In addition, the game is just horrifyingly boring. I would much rather go to work than to play this game. In fact, the government should force people to play this game for hours at a time as a form of torture.",

You were thoughtful in getting me a sim. I don't recomend this one though. It's the most unimaginitive sim I have ever played. You have nothing to do with warehouse logististics. There's no planning, mangement, or coordination. All you do is drive a forklift. You pick up the pallet. You put down the pallet. Rinse, repeat.",
