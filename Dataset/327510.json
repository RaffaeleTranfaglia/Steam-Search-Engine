            "review_text": "   10/10 WOULD FANNYPACK AGAIN     WASTED is a FPS perma-death RPG dungeon crawling shooter with a post-apocalyptic/retro theme set in the 80’s, think of a combination of fallout new vegas/borderlands with additional dungeon crawling elements. You are (randomized character name) and you are one of the drunkards who drinks booze for buffs and perks throughout his adventure for more booze in the underground coolers (vaults)   Pro’s  +Original radio music  +Unique loveable characters  +Wide variety of weapons and customizations  +Fast gunplay, gameplay and replay value  +Randomized dungeons (coolers)  +Permanent perks and separate short term dungeon buffs  +Humorous dialogue: The dialogue stays somewhat close to home with Fallout with a sort of hilarious, twisted and bizarre, but relatable sense of humor (While not to dark) having silly, but strangely loveable characters. My personal favorite so far being Val Killmore the total bro dude  +Good voice acting  +Unique game play elements and strats you can use with them   +Pop culture references that are actually relevant and funny    NOT JUST GENERIC COPY PASTE MEMES        +Really cool dev (Don’t know if I should count this as a pro, but he’s really cool and responsive to suggestions and ideas on the community hub, and seriously sounds like a guy I would want to down a few radioactive drinks with)     Neutrals  Art style: The art style I personally find visually pleasing, but most likely will vary player to player  Semi-permadeath (you keep missions you were doing and can buy back special one of a kind items you lost your previous life but besides that, RIP items that you didn’t store safely at your house)  The S.O.B Purifier: High level enemy that follows you with a minigun when you take   too long   AGES in levels, I personally don’t mind it and I think it changes up the gameplay, but others have complained about it on the discussions before.  RNG Flasks: Let me explain, there are 2 kinds of drinks in the game, Flasks and Beers. When you drink a beer you get a hangover (a permanent perk) that carry’s over with you for the rest of the game (In some cases you can remove it) downing a beer to avoid death to make it back out of the cooler is a cool and safe strat to do if you’re about to die, even if you get a negative hangover (IE: +10% Melee damage taken from enemies) The beers are cool in my opinion, but the flasks, THE FLASKS…. The flasks either carry positive, neutral, or negative buffs; but always seems to work against you in the end, either screwing you over, or giving you some lucky god tier runs. I’ve had to drink beers and get hangovers that are barely beneficial or just debuffs. I’ll type out a couple of examples of them  +Hairy feet: +3 Sneak  +Unbearable: Bear traps only deal 50% damage +Trappin’: Bear traps no longer stun you +Heavy Knuckles: +3 Hit  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bricks: A brick spawns on enemy corpses per kill  -Big Feet: -5 Sneak -Soft Knuckles: -5 Hit -Half life: Max hp halved Nice science joke btw  See the trend here? It’s like this for all of the characters buffs you gain from the flasks, the positive buffs are WAY outweighed by the negative buffs, while the positives give +3 to a stat the negatives give -5 to a stat; not to mention some of the positive buffs are BEARly beneficial    see what I did there?      While the negative buffs can easily screw you over. However, the game never requires you to drink them, and has a confirmation popup that asks if you really want to drink this crap, so I’m letting this slide under the neutral section    Con’s  -Unfair Randomized dungeon rooms: Sometimes the game will give you rooms with locked doors, some of the time you opening them can get you killed by some really silly ways. (My favorite so far has been dying by opening a locked door, being welcomed to a shotgun trap that triggers, blasting me in the face along with mutant freak men that open fire on me with assault rifles ending in my death)  -Enemy’s bullets and projectiles have WAY to much knockback  -Bad voice acting/quality: Most of the voice over’s are spot on and really deliver perfectly, but some characters voice over’s seem somewhat low quality (Not god awful, but enough to notice and be irritating)  -Frames Per Second: This only happens to me on the outside hub areas (where you don't fight at) but is still annoying none the less, while not too bad it still makes my FPS go from 80 FPS in cooler to 35-50 Outside.  I got this game 4 days before the launch and time I am writing this at (6/7/2016) from the Humble Monthly subscription (12$) after originally only subscribing to get Rocket League from the group of games, WASTED has been my favorite from the group, and I’ve honestly had a blast playing this rage inducing masterpiece, and wish there were other games like it out there. Everything about it seems planed out and works together well enough to support its ridiculousness and silly story that you actually find yourself slowly interested in it. So far this is my favorite game of 2016.  TLDR:  Wasted is a post apocalyptic rage inducing joy ride shooter with loveable characters, cool guns and some good laughs  I never write reviews, but since I got to play this game early, along with the fact there are no public reviews   I give WASTED 8.5/10  ",

I don't know if parody is the right word but let's say fallout parody. You create your first character, but don't fall in love with them as you will not survive with that character all the way through. This game makes you start over if you die in the floors and this time you have no VATS or quicksaves to help you.  You explore the 'coolers' which are randomly generated just like you would have in other roguelike/lite games like binding of isaac. Along the way you might find some booze to boost your character... or debuff if you so desire.   The game feels easy at first and in general you do get a lot of healing items, but it's as brutal as you would imagine a roguelike/lite would be if you just wonder deeper down the cooler.   What this game has unique is that it actually has quests too, which require you to do different tasks in the cooler.  Overall I've been enjoying my stay, allbeit I've not even been able to explore the first cooler completely yet so I don't exactly know what the future holds, but I guess that's the point.  So if you want your fallout theme, your roquelike/lite *cough* and your proper fallout 4 *cough* pick this game up!",

            "review_text": "Received WASTED as part of the Monthly Humble Bundle, and I have to say it's great fun so far! It's essentially a dungeon (vault) crawler with the added option of withdrawing early to save (and keep) your items. You do this by drinking until you pass out...  The drinking mechanic is cleverly applied, since whenever you take a drink, you gain a new permananent 'trait'. Wimp out and leave the dungeon/vault early, and you get a poor reward, and maybe even a negative trait. Leave late after battling on and you'll be rewarded with better abilities. Push on too far and you'll just die, losing all of your gear collected.  On top of this, the game has a variety of weapons and gear, as well as character customisation and development. There is also a 'home' area to craft new gear and food to help you in the vaults.  The graphic style is very similar to Borderlands, as is the over-the-top gunplay and explosions. Although it seems clearly influenced by Borderlands, WASTED uses it well. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable game. Recommended!",

            "review_text": "I originally bought this game thinking it was something else, however i was not disappointed, this game is fast paced and fun, with lots of hilarious characters and running jokes, however it is also insanely tough, you have to learn to balance power and accuracy, defense and abilities, and to make sure you never ever get trapped by the S.O.B. or its game over. For as simple of a character model that they use the game has enough detail to keep it interesting. This game is definitely a good buy for any FPS lovers or Rouge-like lovers, it is brutally hard as you keep playing but it is worth it. The systems to send items back to base and so forth along with the interesting choice of resetting the run with every major power up and compounded by the tiny inventory you have... well all in all it makes for a very interesting game.   If i were to make any recommendations for further development options it would be only these: 1. Add a map button so you can full-screen the mini map 2. Since you already seemed to have made all the over world areas have maps, and since the game's platforming elements are not all that explored yet, why not make this open world with waster hideouts, loot caches, and so forth on the surface, and places of interest just get noted down for fast travel via car 3. Add a way to wait a few hours so you can access shops without wasting the rested status 4. Be able to break items down for parts then craft other items, also to learn recipes of items you have collected 5. Could you possibly allow the collection of booze bottles for later sale? I'm just thinking that as your lore says, booze is super valuable, so why not sell a little? 6. Possibly have a training area that allows you to permanently boost a stat but costs tp or booze or something 7. Allow the collection of bullets from loaded weapons (kind of annoying to have 30 bullets sitting in a DUZI when you want to use something a bit more accurate)  Aside from those tiny suggestions you have made an amazing game, I love to play it, and it will be great fun to keep on blasting the enemies and collecting the various awesome goodies, anyone who is thinking of trying this please do, it is fairly awesome and getting better every update.  Again, thank you for the amazing game! It will provide many more hours of entertainment I am sure.",

In your first play through you painstakingly design your character.... only to have them more than likely die at some point :P  I found that if you get into the mindset that you are a raider or a pillager, you have a much happier time, thus also you can get away with a LOT more of an aggressive and rush style of playing cause its not like it matters if you die (you are a raider after all). While sneaking is important and can lead to taking down a baddie much easier (something like 10 times more damage for a headshot sometimes) at some point you will have a hunter looking for you.  In any case its a tonne of fun, I have seen raiders set off traps, have set off traps for raiders, seen a raider accidently shoot another raider which caused a blood bath/ civil war. I have had to collect scalps for a character that lives on someone's crotch, beat the snot out of a whole bunch of raiders with my manly fists of justice.... and all in about 2.4 hours of playtime at time of writing this.  I like this game, I got it through a humble bundle but even for $14 its a tonne of fun  Plus, for those of you who are strange and like to judge their game play based on hours of fun/$.... this being a rouge-like and me barely making through even the begining dungeon/ town (the game hints at something like atleast 6 or 7 towns) you are easily gonna get dozens and dozens of hours of play for what you pay.

The game is a dungeon crawler with a wasteland twist were you a random waster must make due with what you have to proceed to the next level. The game has a great style when it comes to graphics and settings making it 80s opposed to Fallouts 50s as the music also reflects. Enemies you face are well diverse and very tactful in their ways to take you down. Now here is were it gets bad. The game IS VERY UNFAIR. DO not expect checkpoints in this game instead you have to drink radioactive booze in order to get buzz upgrades as well as bottles that give you a hang over transporting you to your house wich you will use to store your gear. However this is made frutless when you have to START OVER from the very beginning WITH THE NEGITIVE EFFECTS THAT STACK EVERY TIME YOU DRINK THOSE BOOZE BOTTLES on the same 'cooler' Mostly causing you to suffer from a rage induced annurism from dying alot, or burnout from the lack of leway the game refuses to give you.This does not get better with the 'Pureifire mechanic' Wich is basicly after some time passes from exploring one of these guys spawns with a magical ability to detect where you are No matter how stealthy you are, and can shrug off the majoirty of punishment you try to lay into it. In short this game would be better if you COULD at least sleep in the administrative checkpoints as well as teleport to them in order to get your berrings, and at least a few more minutes before the purifire responds. NO instead the TRYHARD DESIGNERS decided to go for the old BEAT IT IN ONE GO approach wich has PROVEN to be a bad Design gameplay wise. THIS GAME is a great example of taking the word 'CHALLENGING' too far. Untill i can mod this game so its managable or update it so i have MORE VARIETY IN PLACES I CAN EXPORE AS WELL AS CHECKPOINTS to progress This will just get a negitive rating from me. As for the whole 'git gud' responces you are eager to give anyone who wants to make the game more enjoayble i will say this. Darksouls was a game where difficulty was done right and not just a middle finger to anyone who wishes to enjoy the game. PS to the developers. they way you could have used the purifer mechanic is make it so its a new thing to avoid using stealth or bring down with the use of mines and well placed shots and loot for its strong armor and weapon so more will respond later in an effort to take you down. DONT JUST MAKE HIM THIS UNSTOPPABLE WALL OF DEATH THAT LOCKS ON TO YOU NO MATTER WHAT. ALSO HOW BOUT A LEAN SYSTEM I SWEAR TO GOD THIS GAME COULD USE IT BADLY.",

I'm not going to say I'm interested in any of the characters, but I definately want to see the next joke, find the next piece of sweet gear.  The variety of weapons is kinda lackluster at this time, but aside from the early gear which is just weak, the rest feels like each gun has advantages and disadvantages.  There's a bunch of secrets and fun things to play through and find.

It basically reduces (modern-era FPS) Fallout to a series of randomly generated vaults to explore. There's a total of 5 vaults, and it took me around 15-20 hours to survive all of them, although I was far from optimal about it.  I liked the shooting and exploration elements of the game, and the Fallout parody is well done and generally pretty silly. The elements of progression are a mixed bag - your character doesn't so much as level up as they gain mutations from exploring the vaults, and these are lost if you die. On the other hand, there's a player house that persists where you can store loot so that you've got a better chance at surviving a future run.  The difficulty is somewhat uneven. I had real trouble with the second vault, but then it was a downhill slide to the final cutscene from there. There's a divisive 'hurry up' mechanic in the form of a difficult optional boss enemy that chases you if you linger too long in a level. I didn't mind it, but that's mostly because the benefit of additional loot plateaus early. Past the second vault, I changed very little of my gear, and most of what I did change was quest reward related rather than exploration related. There are also a few bugs and exploitable game mechanics.",

The game starts off with a terrible tutorial, horrible character customization and petrifying voice acting. I want to projectile vomit into the developer's mouths as they have into mine. It got in my eyes a bit as i see these graphics. This game does havbe potential... but not the good kind. Lastly, i just want to say that this game is not what you expect. No freeroaming, no where interesting to be in, and terrible gameplay. You're better off buying 'Bad Rats' as it is worth the money.",

            "review_text": "WASTED, a game heavily inspired by a large number of post-apocalyptic franchises (like Fallout and Wasteland), is branded a 'post-apocalyptic pub crawler'. I must admit that it took me a while to understand why would it be called like that, as there isn't much in terms of pubs in this game. And then it dawned on me. The pub-crawling is actually the dungeon-crawling, as you go down, get wasted, pass out and go back for another swig like a real addict. In essence, that's what the game is playing at - your addiction to dungeon crawling, 'just one more level' mentality, and your unvawering conviction not to give up as the going gets tougher and tougher. This what it makes it the right game for me. I like dungeon crawling, engaging action, and good puns that put a smile on my face.  Let's look at the good and the bad.  THE GOOD:  1. The game is extremely atmospheric. It plays the post-apocalyptic card just as well as the games it has been inspired by.  2. The music score is great, albeit a bit repetitive. 3. The gameplay is extremely engaging. The game is tough as nails, but by no means unfair. It lets you decide how to play, as there are many ways to approach the game. 4. To address the elephant in the room - permadeath is indeed an issue, but if you play the game the way you are supposed to, your 'successor' can start with ample supply of goods and pick right where you left off at no loss of progress, apart from some hanovers that give you some positive and/or negative buffs. This is a good thing, as it keeps you on your toes and makes you think for the future, not just the current 'cooler' run. 5. Gear makes or breaks your game - there is no real RPG progression involved, unlike Fallout, where you put points in stats and skills. I thought I was going to hate this feature, but it actually ends up working for the better. Loot is extremely plentiful in the game and you are able to store and stash it for future characters - in essence allowing them to pick up exactly where you left off - if not stronger. And about that... 6. Your toon has a number of stats that gear items boost. They are referred to as S. H. O. T. S. (clever) - Shoot, Hit, Oblity, Tinker and Stealth. Apart from that you also have armor (flat damage mitigation), critical chance and critical damage procs based on chance or actions. This allows you to focus on gear that would suit your playstyle, and stast gear that would fit a different one, in oder to try it in the future, which I find quite cool. 7. Puns, jokes, jabs, pokes at anything that exists, smiles, laughs, and so on and so forth - it is an understatement to say that everything in this game is a joke. From the character interractions to the item descriptions, from the enemy taunts to the way everything is so jovially put together - you will feel challenged, but also entertained every step of the way as you discover the plethora of easter eggs or read the consoles about how people in the coolers descend into insanity and mutate in all manners of ways. 8. Accepting the game for what it is and playing it as intended makes for a pleasant experience - WASTED plays the 'success is not guaranteed' trump card to its fullest. As such, you can really help your game if you refrain from attaching yourself to a toon, and focus on stashing stuff, ammo and gear for future runs, and just plainly enjoy the ride. 9. Action never lets down - the game keeps you contstantly on your toes, regardless whether you are bum-rushing a level or sneakily taking out enemies. 10. The voice-acting gets the job done - it is nowhere near stellar, but it works to convey the idea of people dumbing down in general.  The BAD:  1. While the levels are randomly geneated, the game is repetitive. You will not find yourself in the same area, doing the same thing, fighting the same enemy, looting the same item from the same place - but it will sure as hell FEEL that way, as your goal is inevitably to reach your goal, or be forced to abort early or just die. And speaking about aborting and dying... 2. If you abort by drinking booze (and getting a hangover) or die, you need to drive back to the cooler and start from the very first level of it, not where you left it. And if you die, anything you haven't stashed or put in a courier box is lost - apart from unique items or ones maked as 'important' - a stamp you craft later on in the game that forces that item to reappear in the 'lost and found' and you get to buy it back. 3. Dungeon levels are randomly generated each time you go in, and have similar loot that only changes after a certain spot. This means you need to wade through the same pistol or melee enemies during the first few levels until the game opens up a bit. And speaking about randomly generated levels... 4. The random layout of a dungeon can make or break your game. You may find a good dungeon layout and make off with tons of bullets, money (toilet paper) and cool items and hangovers, or you may find yourself stuck in a long winding path and take way too long to reach the next level. And about that... 5. If you take too long to reach a level, a big bad wolf, send by the Brotherhood of Steel (BOS), whoops, sorry, I mean Syndicate of Buzzkillers (SOB) Purifier will start hunting you down. If you are forced to retrace your steps, you will inevitably run into him, and likely die. There are ways to get past him by exploiting the environment or the time he is forced to reload, but if the dungeon layout doesn't allow it, your run is over, along with all the sweet loot you gathered. 6. If you don't play the game as intended (stash stuff, deposit your cash, don't get attached to your first toon, etc.), you will tear your hair out and throw a ton of expletitives at your screen. I know I did... 7. Sadly, you don't get to customize your successors. So if you do get attched to your toon, Alt-F4 on death might be your option, as many do now. This way you will have to redo the cooler, but at least get to keep your dude... This is why I keep on saying that you shouldn't get attached to the characters and just play as the game expects you to.  Conclusion:  I really, really like WASTED. It is tough, but not unfair. It aims to kill you, but gives you so many options to hold your own. It lets you buildcraft (or should I say gearcraft) and change playsyles on the fly. If you play it properly, it allows you to progress even through death. The models are cool, the enemies are fun, and the easter eggs and jokes will put a smile on your face. If you enjoy fact-paced dungeon (or should I say 'fungeon'?) crawling action, this game is certainly the right one for you. And to repeat myself, anything (or anyone) that can put a smile on your face or make you laugh and feel happy is priceless.",

Do not try this game if you do not enjoy games like Don't starve, where you have to learn how to survive different situations with strategies and techniques. Once you get the feel for it you will be hooked and the experience is unlike anything i've had in the past. It's a adrenalin rush mixed with pain that makes you stay up late thinking about how it hurts so good.   The Voice acting in this game is so entertaining that I still find myself laughing every now and again at the delivery and great cheese added to every bite. To add to this, the soundtrack to this game is popping. I'd say that it comes very close to Doom in that way, I might even hunt down the soundtrack and buy up the songs.   Now that I'm about halfway through this game i'm actually really scared to beat it so soon. I enjoyed my time with Wasted more than any other game this year. It was funny, challenging, memorable, and fun to look at. I really hope that the creators maybe think of doing an expansion in the future.  GET THIS GAME, you will not regret it!",

            "review_text": "WASTED is set after the Cold War between the USSR and the United States came to fruition in a barrage of nuclear fire. You play as a waster, one of many foolish enough to travel to the western wastes aka California to acquire the mystical, rare, and extremely irradiated booze. It isn't an easy jog through the park though, as our protagonist must travel deep into the depths of coolers, or vaults meant to house the greatest scientific minds safely until after the nuclear fallout. Sadly, due to the companies that built these bunkers cheaping on materials most of the inhabitants are dead or mutated beyond recognition. In this game you will glady battle other wasters and the mutant products of radiation, all for the ambrosia that is a good scotch.  The gameplay of the game is quite fun and the best way I can describe this game to others is if you mutated Fallout 3 into more of a rougelike instead of an open world exploration game. You have stereotypical quests, shooting baddies in the face, and the rougelike staple of more loot than you know what to do with. Speaking of shooting, the gunplay is more complex than one would think initially. Instead of your usual FPS bullet sponges, these adversaries pack a punch and also get debuffed in shot in a specific part of the body. For example if one shoots an antagonist in the leg, their movement speed will be slowed. If you shoot enemies in their enormously grotesque heads then you have a higher change to get a critical hit. Finally, if you shoot an enemy in the groin, they take a guarenteed +100% critical hit damage. This leads to enjoyable firefights where you must think on your feet to achieve the best end result. There isn't only gunplay though, there is also melee and explosives. I haven't spent much time using explosives since it doesn't really fit my playstyle but you can expect big booms that do a satisfying amount of damage. The melee is my only real gripe with the combat system. The melee at times feels laggy, especially when you use charged attacks. Another issue I had with melee is because melee weapons are held so close to your characters body in first person view, it is very hard to deiscern what your melee hitbox is.  What is gameplay without good enemy AI though. This game has some of the best AI I have ever had the pleasure of playing against. They use strategy which is first of all astonishing such as hiding when reloading and they actively dodge bullets. Considering this is more of an indie title, I was thoroughly impressed. Sadly nothing can be perfect though. Whether is due to the radiations brain damage or a lack of dangerous object avoidance, but enemies will often walk, or even run, into killer traps such as gun tripwires, bear traps, and toxic waste and will die. I wish that they would be a bit smarter so that I didn't feel like I was cheesing the system by jumping over toxic waste and a group of melee wasters would charge after me and quickly die to the poison. I would be fine if they were knocked back into these environmental hazards, and it would make melee a bit more rewarding of a gameplay style. All in all, this AI still makes for a great Wild West shootout game that is challenging, but is also rewarding such as learning how the different enemy types will react to your presence.  Speaking of presence, the game also has a bare bones stealth system which works for melee and guns. If you are crouched you are considered in stealth form and can critical hit anyone not aware of you. While this is a fun addtion, I found that with a high enough sneak rating on my armor bonuses enemies would sometimes walk right past me when I was crouched but not hiding while other times enemies would spot me across the room, so I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong.  The story is enjoyable and silly, but don't think silly to mean childish. The jokes are spot on with their comedic timing and sometimes take a good knowledge of raunchy innuendo to understand complete. With memerable characters which are all fully voice acted I can't help but enjoy what I have played of the story so far.  The options menu of this game is its major flaw. There are only four small resolutions with the highest widescreen one being 1280 x 720 and while the game runs fine I did dislike that this game did not run at a modern resolution.   This game is currently is just good fun.",

            "review_text": "  WASTED    Teel deer: An unfair game with many limits in many ways. good graphics, but little else. not really worth it.   WASTED is a Semi decent permadeath FPS 'dungeon' crawler, parodying Fallout, the 80's, with a dash of the graphical style from borderlands. Now, The person who made this game, Mr Podunkian, is known for STREEMERZ, of the Action 52 owns project, which was actually a very good retraux game (playable on a NES, no less).  While my computer is a semi potato, I experienced extreme lag on the Limited overworld areas, and such. This is pretty consistent with what other people said, so I assume its not just me.  The music, which is again, Limited, is actually very 80's esque, and would definitely fit right in. Of course, you only get to hear the actual songs if a boom box is nearby, or you get an item that allows you to listen to it.  One of the main problems of this game is the LIMITS. right from the getgo, you start out with 10 inventory spaces. and from there, you can get 3 fanny packs (bum, sideslung, and regular) to increase that to 16, which is not enough for the stuff you'll have. not to mention, you can't have multiples of some items, because why the **** not. that means you have to desprately rotate your stock of healing items, pizzas, liquified bread, and taters to make sure you don't die.   and all for a good bottle of beer to drink. Now, the perks on the beers are pretty cool (except for the starter ones, which are basically Get the heck outta heres)... except that once you die, you have to reobtain them all over again. you can store goods in your house, but you can only store what you have on you, plus up to 6 (later 8) items you put in a box. Most of the time, most of the stuff you have on you is pretty much required for surviving in floors 7-10 in EVERY cooler you face.  Thats what makes it so difficult and unfair. the game throws so much cheap shots at you, that its difficult to get an actual foothold, unless you intentionally farm out multiple characters. from zombie machinegunners that can easily stunlock you, to landmines that blend in well with the ground, to traps that can One Hit Kill WITHOUT NOTICE, and you have an unfair and difficult game. Oh, that character you named at the beginning? he gets replaced with RANDOM ones. that you can't rename unless you get a perk from defeating one of the coolers.  So yeah, All in all, I would say pass on this, unless you're wanting a challenge.",
