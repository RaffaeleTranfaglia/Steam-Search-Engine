            "review_text": "While it does directly rip off Angry Birds (especially with its HUD and menu interface), that's just nit-picking. It adds more to the table, and that's what counts. It's fun and funny and the challenges are well-thought out. I want to see a sequel with a slightly better budget, a few more features, and a HUD that looks a little more original. Probably Christianity-themed.  Now, this game was probably made by a non-theist as a joke, and that's just fine. Anyone who gets offended at this game needs to chill and have a sense of humor. I'm a serious Christian and this game is harmless fun. If you're secure in your se-- I mean Christianity, you should be able to make jokes and parodies about it. Then again, if you're offended at this game, you're probably just really sheltered.",

I used to be an atheist before I played this game, but now I can proudly say I understand why the Romans did it.    8/10. Good time waster, considering the price.  ",
