If someone held a gun to my head and demanded that I find one negative thing about this game, it would probably be Love's voice, which was kind of ugly in my opinion (Hate's voice, on the other hand, was brilliant). Other than that, there isn't really much to complain about.  A great example of a well-done iOS/Android game port.  Recommended. ",

I really enjoyed Tiny &amp; Big, it was a fun game packed full of a bunch of secrets and extra content without wearing out its welcome for me. And then the studio follows it up with Yet Another Puzzle/Platform Game.  I mean, it's competently made, it's got a handy step-by-step rewind system if you screw up, keeping it from getting superbly frustrating as you go on, it adds in new blocks/'creatures' to interact with as you go on so it isn't all samey... but it's still basically one of those titles that comes to mind when you hear someone say 'indie game' in a derisive tone.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it, in the end, it just fizzled out. It's decently made, I just don't ever want to see one of these again, my god.",

            "review_text": "Bottom line: About Love, Hate and the other ones started out quiet alright. It later turned into a headache, though. It really isn't a BAD or HORRIBLE game. It simply stops being fun, way too soon.  The game has a simple concept which is easy to grasp, It's basically a puzzle platformer where you have two buddies - Love and Hate, and you have to make one of them push a button. That simple. The way is lined with obstacles, of course, or we'd have no game, right?  The trouble is that the game is not done too interestingly, and while being a good port of the mobile game, it really fails to feel 'fun' all the way through. I've finished most of the levels but at the very beginning I felt I'm playing it just to finish the game, really.  About Love, Hate and the other ones gets too boring, too repetitive, too tedious, and too soon, unfortunately. There are some challanging levels but most are really not (except for the very last 10-15 levels, maybe).  Generally, not much was done too keep us entertained and intrigued. Leaving the gameplay aside, the graphics are OK but nothing special, there are barely any sound effects or any effects at all (except for the 'I love you, I looooooooove you, I hate you' you'd keep hearing over and over and would probably want to mute eventually). There's no story whatsoever. There's nothing much, in short.  This game is pure casual stuff, which is not necessarily bad, but here it simply doesn't work that well.  This is not a bad game, not at all, but it really isn't anything too good. It's probably nice to beat a level once in a while, once in a week or so. But for games like this, I'd say to just keep them in the smartphone. Otherwise it gets pretty tiring.",
