            "review_text": "Obviously 'inspired' by the Kingdom Rush series, but very well produced. I enjoyed playing it, and would recommend it to those who like Tower Defense games.  Pros: Nice animations and art style, voice acting and quirky humor. Contains fresh elements in the tower defense genre, even though it is similar in appearance to Kingdom Rush.  Cons: Some bugs here and there (textual, or support buildings connecting to the wrong towers). Some of the upgrades you can purchase have very little use.",
