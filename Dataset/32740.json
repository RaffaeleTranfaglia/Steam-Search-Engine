    "description": "The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum is one of the world's most maneuverable and toughest fighter jets and has often been compared to its closest Western counterpart, the F-16. Innovations unique to the aircraft allow MiG pilots to perform remarkable moves like the Tailslide and Cobra maneuvers.",

It does seem a shame that games like this are not being made anymore. The worst example is as a Star Wars fan I loved the X-Wing series, XWA was made over a decade ago now and no signs of another fighter sim to come. Seems the same with novalogic and jet fighter games too :(",
