Though the graphics weren't amazing, it wasn't really anything to make me dislike the game, though I did spot a few wrong textures.  I spent the first level aimlessly wandering around, getting more and more frustrated until I accidentally fell into the river. It could have been more obvious or maybe that was just me being stupid.  I really enjoyed the parkour element and the music and visuals but I wouldn't play it again.  I would definetly reccomend trying it out. It's fun once you understand and very intriguing.  Overall, I think it's a good game but perhaps not quite my cup of tea.  8 random blob monsters out of 10",

The graphics has seemed to me pretty good, everything is done beautifully. But more of graphics I liked music. The music is very pleasant for the ears. Minuses I did not notice, because was admiring the surroundings. I recommend to the purchase this game. If you are tired by a hard day and want to relax, you must try this game.",
