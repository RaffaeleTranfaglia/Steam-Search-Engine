            "review_text": "(tl;dr at the bottom of the post)  Think of this game as a turn based trading board game you play by yourself. It includes lots of random elements that are effectively dice rolls except that one of the dice has a broken wheel every turn and it takes an extra day to roll it. If you play the storymode you start as a youth trying to avenge your father's death/betrayal brought on by his business partner who is never really mentioned after first hearing about him. Now prepare yourself for what feels like a lifetime of gameplay not accomplishing much at all...  Considering the developers are Polish I'm surprised how little 'polish' this game has... I bought it on a recent sale where it went down well under $5. I think it's is well worth &lt;$5 but definitely not worth the non-sale price (~$15 right now). Overall this game stinks of a development schedule that was cut short. It's full of half-baked features, poor optimization and a general lack of refinement. It seems more like a greenlit game than a full game... Oh wait! That's because it was a greenlit game that was probably just rushed to market with the wonderful double game launch functionality Steam has invented.  Unlike the main description exclaiming that the game has 'lots RPG elements' there are in fact very few (no traditional exp / levels / etc...). There is one stat point that determines whether or not you'll have a good time or if gameplay will be hellish. This stat is 'Luck' and can have a value of -3.0 or +3.0. Ultimately it determines whether or not you have negative encounters while travelling (although carts seem to break down regardless of luck). Once you figure out that you only have to boost this one stat (  maybe by using some kind of diety based gambling mechanic?  ) then you have very few negative encounters and a ton of positive ones - effectively rigging the dice, feels more like cheating than anything.  The UI is not very intuitive and has quite a few menus that only appear under specific conditions. Playing through the storyline you'll also be bombarded with tons and tons of unnecessarily wordy text for quests (go to this place), or world events (excess amount or famine on certain goods). All it would take is bolding on the keywords to eliminate the need for the text description but nope! - read this long block of pointless narrative when all we really want is for you to go from one location to another and then do that one or two more times and maybe buy something....  There are many items in the game but they don't seem to do anything - they likely to do stuff but very few of them have clear indicator of what they do. Some of them lower the price of certain goods but the lowered price is displayed in red so the immediate assumption is that it's set higher or you're being punished for doing a quest for the 'bad guys'. Again - these suffer from the same UI problems (excessive text) I mentioned before and tend to have pretty vague interactions.  There are also bugs but whatever. They're less annoying than all the other issues...  Eventually you start ignoring the bulk of the text and then scan for keywords, even further down the road you start just mindlessly clicking through the dialogs - you have +3.0 luck remember? Surely with the broken mechanic in hand you can beat this awful game and put it to rest along all the others in your steam library. Oh what;s that? You accidentally gambled away 600 units of Arms for 600 units of Food? Oh well, you managed to trade those back a bit later or maybe the $160,000 wasn't really important in the grand scheme of things. Now you have your main character, a guy in a boat and a guy in an airship and a couple mines. Every turn requires to to make three moves - for three distinct characters. It's as if the developers said to themselves 'Hey - I know what would be more fun than playing this long arduous game with tons of dialogs and wordy text and slow progress! Playing it three times at the same time so it takes three times as long to accomplish anything!'. It's like the kid who plays the board game by himself only to find that it was made for other players so he brings out the other player pieces and starts playing with them too. It's just dark and sad and pretty time consuming.    Tl;dr",

            "review_text": "This is a fun and atmospheric trading game set in the mystical world of Kaidan.  Pros: + rich atmosphere. The hand-painted pictures and soundtrack are superb!  + sophisticated economy. Prices will change depending on season, random events, luck etc. + dozens of side quests. I was receiving so many that I began to turn them down. + there's a few mini-games to break up the trading grind.   Cons: - the early phase of the game can be very hard. You can only trade a few items. Some people may be deterred.  - lack of character customisation. You're stuck playing the main character of the game.  - lack of RPG. You have no traits, attributes, relationships etc. The only number that changes is your gold. I would've liked to be able to interact with the world of Kaidan in a more organic way.  - a few bugs still exist in the game. - some spelling errors.   Overall, it's a fun game. If you love trading games like Elite, but also want to immerse yourself in a fantasy setting, this game should be on your list. During the last session I played, I lost sense of time and suddenly realised it was midnight. Games like this deserve a thumbs up.",

The text in the game is rife with grammatical errors which ruins the emersion. The music is nice, the quest tracking is rancid, there are four separate quest tracking tabs and if you're not careful you could accidentally time out a quest in an unmonitored tab. THere is a quest needs to be completed ! when there is about 5 days left on the quest which could trigger when you're at the very least distance away of two weeks. The slider selection tool for selecting troops and other such things is horrendous. When I try to reduce my units to send into a cave by 1, it goes to 0, not instantly, incrementally beyond my control, this is a bug because it bounces back and forth like it's playing pong all without any input from my device. It can't be my mouse, because nothing else is affected, not the mouse pointer, not other mouse based games. Once a unit is set in a location, ie.. Monk in a temple, with a botonist, fermentist, and agriculturist, none of the accessories (everything but the monk so to speak), can be retracted so they can be trained.  This game is fun and is not worth more than $1.25 in its current state. The least they could do is proof read the English text, and if English isn't their first language, they should find someone who can proof read the translation, it looks like whoever wrote this game has English as a second language and based on its linear progression I would guess this comes from a Chinese developer or an 8th grade English drop out (no offense meant to the Chinese develeoper, my Mandarin is worse). And please fix the damn bugs, and ui issues. Not to mention the graphic optimization is terrible as well, I have an R9 290X graphics card and experience poor framerates on the top down map when there is rain or snow.

The game is broken or just full bugs.    The game is also heavily base on luck(random events) so not just the game economy makes no sense and is random but is base in luck.

Most good trading games have a trading engine at their core, with 'RPG' extras. While this game attempts that, it's core trading mechanics are so unrewarding that it just makes it annoying, and the 'RPG' extras in the game are virtually nonexistent. For the most part you are wandering the map, getting frustrated at the incremental progress you're making or lack of, which after awhile it gets repetitive and boring. The economy in the game makes no sense, it seems to be extremely flawed at it's core since it's most important feature is the trading and yet its so poorly done. Also, it takes over 6 hours for 3 cards to drop, ridiculous!",

The mechanics are good, with many variable factors and random events, but like other games of the genre, requires perseverance to learn what goods are profitable, where buy and sell, and, over all, keep on moving on search of benefits, by air, earth and sea. And this is the true challenge of the game, with a main campaign with more than 100 'missions' in a little map of 40 cities and towns. Can buy special or magic items, hire professionals of various types and mercenaries, manage mines, distilleries and parlours. Maybe its not orgininal, shows a lot of unnecessary texts and requires at least Windows 7, but it should be welcomed among the trading titles. Like the game teaches, buy it with a generous discount!",

            "review_text": "Weeeeell this game is frustrating!  Here are the good parts:  - Now, the game runs well and has no bugs that i could see, so thats good - The graphics are pretty low so it should work on any old cr..a..p...py computer, device whatevar. In fact, there are no animations, only still images. But its ok for a trading game. I didn't mind - Sound is ok but repetitive. Might want to mute the music after awhile.   The bad parts:  - It's not a good trading game. It seems everything you do depends far more on luck than how competent you are at trading stuff. Just getting the 4000 gold to get into the merchant guild as your first quest took hours where i traveled around, made only money to stay even (at 1000 gold) when suddenly i got lucky and found a village selling low priced food right next to the capital who bought it at high price. There i made 3000 gold in 5 minutes. That's after 4 hours of play! - To make things even worse, price flucuates wildly for no reason most of the time. The only logical reason is because of the season change, One day food is priced at 6 gold and a few days later its 20 golds. And the season didn't change. And it can happen at any city or farming village. WTFuuuuuu..c...k? So trying to establish a valuable trading route is impossible. It all depends on the luck you have to be at the right place at the right time. So most of the time, you move around with no cargo because its not worth it. But you still have to pay your guys each day. - To make things a lot worse, you got the concept of how lucky you are! It goes from -3 to +3. Positive is good and negative is very very bad. When in the positive, most of the time nothing happens when you travel, so thats pretty good. But if you misbegotten son of a wh....ore get into the negative, you are in deep troubles. At -1.4, i got dragons attacking me EVERY TRIP. They eat my wares so i lose cash over the maintenance i pay for each trip. And when you are unlucky, it is very difficult to get back to lucky or neutral again, because you get more and more unlucky events that drop your luck.  You might say, just pay a sheet.load of money to get your luck back, but until you are very rich, you don't have the money to buy your way outta bad luck.  WOW, what a concept! A game so based on luck that it doesn't matter what you do it all depends on chance!  I don't like game of chance so this game is not for me. I prefer to play poker instead, i get better luck and its far more fun. ",

That's not just me saying it, it's also the giantbomb gameguide writer saying 'ya, totally random pricing, good luck'. You got cities sometimes selling food for less than the rural villages. Mountain towns selling ore for more than the villages on the plains. And if they just came out and say 'ya, it's totally random' at least you'd know what you are dealing with. But no, they insist on telling you over and over that certain cities are producers and others are consumers. Well if that is true, sir, you are the worst buggiest programmer to every write an economy AI.  And in a buck against the trend, this game starts brutally hard then (according to game guides) becomes extremely easy. This must be to make some kind of point that starting easy and increasing the challenge as the player learns the game is all wrong.  I don't know why they made a trading game where the new player can only trade in 4 of all the products. And then make 2 of those 4 useless (you'll never find someone buying it for higher than you got it) so you have to GRIND your way to making the first 4,000 gold 50-100 gold at a time. I spent 2hrs and only got 2,000 gold. I give up. I see no reason to grind in an unfun game just to hope it becomes fun later.",

            "review_text": "First impression: A reasonably solid trading sim so far, although scraping your way up out of the dirt is arduous.  Second impression: Some of the quests for the trader's guild are mysterious. I was told to go make a profit on a trade between the barbarians and the empire, of at least fifty units of a single good. When I did so, a notification popped up saying I'd accomplished one of four tasks! ... What? So I went back to the capital to see if there was another stage to this quest, and there wasn't. Then I went back to the barbarians, and did another trade, getting the popup for 2/4 tasks done. So then I went back and forth between the barbarians and nearby imperial outposts, figuring I needed to trade four times -- no dice. It only counts it when I do a valid trade a fraction of the time. What the hell? It also really doesn't help that there's a timer in days on this quest, making me have to start over every time I try to get it done.  This game is poorly written and programmed, but I do like the idea?  Third impression: I am ridiculously back and forth on this game. Once I got past the quest mentioned above (apparently I needed to do profitable trades, each direction, between THREE factions) I immediately went back to having fun. There's typos everywhere, quests are a lot harder than I think they were designed to be, but in the end it's got the basics down. I will say that you want to click on the easy mode thing when making your game : it makes the price fluctuations a lot less nonsensical, and makes it much easier to get profitable trades on most journeys.  Would benefit from a walkthrough; but I can't deny I keep having fun.",

One of the games for those 'bionic beaver' Unisys ICON computers was a game called Cargo Sailor where you (as Prestige Worldwide put it) 'sail around the world and go port to port' (by furiously rolling the trackball that was built into the keyboard - the game didn't let you chart a course for your ship) buying and selling goods. There was no combat, no pirates to defend against, and that was really lame. But I understood that the school wouldn't let me play cool violent games, so at least Cargo Sailor was better than doing word searches or other busywork after I finished my work.  But I graduated a long time ago, so I'm not stuck playing boring education games. MoK has some random events, but it's still just boring buying and selling. If I'm too much of a wussy merchant to kick butt, fine, but at least let me bribe some demons to attack a mine after I get a monopoly on all the ore or something. Supposedly a combat minigame will be added to game at some point, but how could it be any good if it's going to get shoehorned in that late in development?
