            "review_text": "Appointment With F.E.A.R. is a -very- slick videogame adaptation of a classic 1985 Figthing Fantasy gamebook.   For those who don't remember Fighting Fantasy, they were a series of excellent choose-your-own-adventure books with a roleplaying bent. Most of them featured warlocks and demons, so the superhero-themed Appointment With F.E.A.R. really stood out as a unique part of the series.   You begin the game by choosing your hero's superpower, look, and name. There aren't a huge number of options to choose from - only four powers, ten faces per power, a range of colour choices, and randomised names - but from that point on, you'll be bombarded with a crazy range of equally crazy superhero crises, all day, everyday.   You'll face a series of tough choices every few minutes ('Do I apprehend a mad poisoner, or rescue a public pool from the Ice Queen?' 'Rescue a kitten or stop a chainsaw massacre?'). These scenarios will play out very differently depending on your choice of powers, as well as clues you may have found along the way. Logic can help you a lot of the time, but other times you'll just have to rely on dumb luck. There's some basic fighting involved, and your victories will reward you with collectable cards and high-score-related victory points. Also quips. Quips are fun.  Still, preventing street crime alone won't save the city - you need to carefully navitage each of these situations if you hope to gather enough information to stop F.E.A.R.'s grand plot. Be warned, this isn't an easy gamebook. I've replayed the game around five times without getting close to success, and the game's backtracking options haven't helped me much either.  So...is it worth $6?  That totally depends on whether or not you like choose-your-own-adventure gamebooks. I *loved* this series as a kid, so it was an instant purchase for me. If you're unfamiliar with the series, well, it's a neat distraction. You can easily kill a few hours trying to navigate this game's labyrinthine crimesprees, and the sheer variety of events keeps things replayable for a while.  Now excuse me, my Professor Amazing has accidentally killed another civillian with his Energy Blasts, and I should probably flip back a few pages...",

            "review_text": "Not what I was hoping for. I was looking for a casual, fun, somewhat engaging superhero opus, what I got was a super silly game that wouldn't even let me create the name of my character. I had to page through randomly generated hero names until I found one that wasn't nonsense and just plain stupid. I could have done better using an on-line name randomizer. Also I guessing the Steve Jackson who wrote this is not the same guy behind Steve Jackson Games, the level of quality just isn't there. The combat is ok for what it is, but what the heck is generating the hit locations of the moves? Hitting the guy in the right toe or left nostril is, again, just silly and has no effect on the game what so ever. I wasn't expecting DC on-line from a $5 game, but then again DC on-line is free to play so I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.",

More of the FF books on Steam please, I played virtually all of them when I was younger and there are a lot of great stories that I'd like to play through again.  Edit: After a few more hours of play...  One thing I don't like, and I appreciate it is part of the game, is how completely random the information you get is. Bits of information about the F.E.A.R meeting are scattered about, but unless you a) get the encounters you need and b) couple them with randomly getting given the clues needed to solve them, you can't win.",
