            "review_text": "A faithful and well-done conversion of an excellent boardgame. Simple to learn but suprisingly deep, it trades tactical and strategic complexity for a simple ruleset that accurately simulates the Revolutionary War without bogging you down in minutiae. The 'Truce Card' is a brilliant way to reflect civilian morale and military depletion. The AI for the single player is competent but not perfect; I think new players will probably be a little frustrated at first until they grasp the subtleties, but even experienced players can hone their skills.",

If you like the boardgame and now want to reach out and challenge others in the virtual sphere. This is for you. I highly recommend this to any board gamer. A must buy.",
