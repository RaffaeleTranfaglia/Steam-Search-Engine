            "review_text": "  King Oddball: ~~~~~~~~~~  My dear fellow gamers, this is the story of King Oddball!   Once upon a time . . . wait, what am I doing? Let’s get straight to the point - Oddball does not like humans at the best of times. He pretty much wants to destroy them and that’s exactly what he is going to do. So, which one of you is ready to become the terrifying King Oddball?   King Oddball is a 2D/Casual/ Puzzle game in which you play a pivoting head in the middle of the sky and your goal is to eliminate all human military forces by throwing rocks using your tongue. The game starts with the king at the bottom of a map. This map has nine large squares and within each of them you have another sixteen squares where nasty human units are located and will need to be destroyed. As you progress during the game some of the squares have other icons on them, like a grenade. They are basically challenges and instead of throwing rocks, you’ll throw grenades or different items.   The gameplay is really fun. You have units (soldiers, helicopters and tanks) stationed on each level to be eliminated with the pivoting King Oddball, which sits in the middle of the sky. In some levels, you might have four throws but it is usually three. If you manage to destroy over three units with one throw, you’ll earn an extra go and this may help you the clear the level.  Nice 2D graphics and the game is very easy to play.  Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Nice 2D graphics - Plenty of levels and challenges - Ease to play - Achievements and trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - It is repetitive   King Oddball is a fun and original casual/puzzle game. Great way to pass the time.  7/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!
