Expect a few flaws like getting stuck on movable objects, sloppy animations or the fact that picked up items do not carry over to the next level.  For 59 cents (Sale) this is okay.  ",

            "review_text": "To preface all this, I bought the game on sale for like $0.59. It isn't really worth it. Is the kind of game play you would expect to find on the app store for your phone for free. Story is bare minimum with an opening cutscene and a 'You win' screen at the end. Finished the game start to finish in apparently 66 minutes including getting up to get a drink about halfway through.   Graphics are borderline terrible. Assets are heavily inspired or stolen from games like Mario (Thwomps). Music is short loops that get very old very quickly. Sound effects are bare minimum required and even the 1-up sound from Mario is re-used.   There is little to no replay value at all in this game. No secrets to find, no hidden items. For $0.59, I'm disappointed somehow. I ran into a couple of glitches. Boxes needed to hold down switches and stuff getting stuck in the wall or not falling through the slot they are supposed to and having to spend a minute or two fidgeting around them to get them to go. At one point I lost the ability to bounce on enemies, which was somewhat of a problem since it was at a point where you have to bounce on enemies to cross a gap.   The best part of this game was one of my cats loved the animations and sat with me pawing my screen, and it was cute.",

Only difference is that it has great sound effects. Oh wait. They sure do sound familiar don't they? I got this with a coupon so I got my money's worth. Unless that happens to you I can't recommend it. I could recommend 3 different websites that could give you the same quality gameplay and won't cost you anything. Only buy it if you could profit off of the trading cards like me :3",
