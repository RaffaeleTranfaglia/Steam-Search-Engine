            "review_text": "Well   I   liked it!  This sort of game isn't for everybody, I don't think the dev made it for the casual gamer, or even the hardcore gamer. The storyline is dense, but it's there. It doesn't hand you everything on a silver platter, because let's face it, you definitely don't want to think about anything when you're playing a game. No, that would require effort.   Let me see if I can help those who find the storyline too complex, because they're not willing to read:  This is a prequel to //NPPD RUSH//, in which you play the villain, but in this game, the villain is a good guy; in N.P.P.D. Rush, the good guy is a villain. In N.P.P.D. Rush, you're saving junkies, or hookers. In this game, you're collecting those hookers/junkies in order to sell into slavery. There's more to it than that, but that's a basic outline. I figured this out in less than an hour of playing both games   combined.   You can play this game for twenty minutes and get everything you'll know to expect. Abstract ideas aren't something that goes over too well with the gaming community, and the trolling is a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittle out of hand. People leaving a bad review for this game within an hour of release and it's the   ONLY   game they've reviewed on Steam and posted publicly? Get real.   Like with the other Rail Slave Games, I'm not going to give this a 1-10 rating like I do with most other games. It's not that kind of game.",
