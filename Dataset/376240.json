Sophisticated automation of multi-step tasks helps you manage the complexity, but that just allows it to become even more complex. The alchemy here is a little reminiscent of the ritual magic in King's Quest III, but gives a stronger sense of being a system, with recipes that support substitutions.  I originally played the iOS version, but the Steam version has the same content, with a somewhat improved UI. (Finally I can keep the Alchemy Journal open in a separate window while typing in commands!)",

It is truly enjoyable, especially for anyone who enjoys reading. Anytime I get confused, I just type random cuss words in, and enjoy seeing the words 'command not recognized'. Truly enjoyable! 10/10",
