    "description": "Vex is a retro, re-imagining of the classic arcade genre, and strikes the balance between simplicity and intricacy. It is a casual yet challenging game, reminiscent of the early days of video games, but with a more modern feel. Vex is a crowdfunded indie game, built with love and character in mind.",
