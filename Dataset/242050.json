            "review_text": "The internet has a big thing for pirates so it’s quite amusing that we have never had a fantastic pirate video game. Sure, we have had games that use a theme around piracy, say Skies of Arcadia’s sky pirates or the pirate theme of The Secret of Monkey Island, but there’s never been one game that has managed to blend in the concept of being a pirate, exploring the ocean and visiting islands quite like how it is done in Ubisoft’s increasingly popular Assassin’s Creed series.Ubisoft has learnt from the blunders of the incredibly slow introduction that Assassin’s Creed III featured. This is great news for fans or newcomers, as it means people jumping into Black Flag don’t have to sit through hours of slow paced story plots and tutorials to understand the game’s mechanics. Within the time frame that it took the player to start playing Connor in Assassin’s Creed III, you’ve already learnt pretty much everything that you can do in the world of Black Flag. Even better is that the main character, Edward Kenway, the grandfather of Connor, is a much more likeable person. He’s got an aura around him that was missing from the forever-straight behaviour of Connor. The overall tone of Black Flag is much more light-hearted in nature, thanks to the comical and carefree personality of the Welsh pirate, which is on display throughout the game’s many cutscenes.Story wise, Black Flag takes place a few decades before the main events of Assassin’s Creed III, and is set in a vast ocean filled with the tropical islands of the Caribbean. It begins with Edward in the midst of a storm fighting with another ship, which just happens to house an Assassin. Things go horribly wrong and Edward is washed onto a beach, along with the Assassin that killed some of his crew members. Like any good Welsh man, he gets revenge and plunders his gear, becoming a pirate masquerading as an Assassin.The plot is filled with Assassins and Templars – it’s in the franchise’s DNA to do so – as they all hunt down a thing called the Observatory. What makes this story different is the piracy theme. Edward doesn’t care much about the Assassins or Templars and their thousand year war; he just wants to have the Observatory for himself, so that he can become the wealthiest pirate that ever lived. With no loyalty to either gang, you see Edward acquiring help from both sides as he tries to gain clues and figure out where this special place is hidden.Edward’s personality and the game’s theme makes the story an interest one, and it’s backed up with fascinating supporting characters that include famous pirates like Blackbeard (Edward Teach) and James Kidd. The sci-fi elements still remain – Abstergo are featured in the present time, as the player is put into the role of an employee working at Abstergo Entertainment. Near enough from the get go the entire game’s world is available to explore. There are some areas that are pumped with harder difficulty to make it less welcoming for the player to sail there, but once the boat is obtained, the ocean really is the only limit. The world is huge, and what is even more impressive is that it’s filled with lots of unique locations that contain plenty of secrets to discover.While it’s easy to get lost in discovering new land and finding collectibles, there are three major cities, Kingston, Havana and Nassau, that Edward will revisit on multiple occasions. Each city feels alive and distinct from one another, and all are packed with plenty of hidden collectibles to find.Black Flag builds a lot on top of the ship components of the previous title. You’ll take part in plenty of ship combat, but thankfully that has been fleshed out with better controls of the ships weaponry.You no longer need to remember what button launches what attack, as depending where the camera is focused will determine what weapon will launch. But Black Flag is more than just blowing up boats, as when conquered ships are on their last legs, the player has the chance to pull in and board the vessel. Once aboard, a required amount of crew must be killed before the ship’s goods become your own. There are plenty of side quests to do when out on the seas, such as hunting down whales or other creatures and using the materials gained from carving animals to improve existing gear, similar to 2012’s Far Cry 3.Combat is still easy, continuing with the comparable counter-heavy fighting system that we have seen in games like the Batman Arkham series, but with less fluidity in animation. A change to the interface means equipping gear is snappy, and using dual pistols is as easy as pulling the shoulder button to aim or pressing Y to shoot at an auto target. If there’s one thing the combat can pull off, it’s that it looks flashy when you have mastered the skills and are taking down a group of guys.When you’re done with the story and all its crazy additional side-questing, there’s the multiplayer that can be jumped into. If you’ve played the previous games, then you have an idea how it works. It follows the same principles of finding the target and killing them, while not getting stabbed by the people that are hunting you.What I did spend a lot of time doing is looking in awe at how beautiful the game can be. Black Flag looks fantastic on the PC, with some thirst inducing ocean and wave effects that are some of the best generated in a video game. The world also looks great, with a lot of detail going into making a believable incarnation of the West Indies, with quality texture work and decent models.Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is an amazing pirate game, and also my favourite Assassin’s Creed title, which goes hand in hand with the more open nature of the pirate theme.",

If you have a mind to you can massacre everyone in game with hardly a thought, and there really isn't much reason to anyway. Outside of the structured missions there's very little to do on the ground, and some of those missions can be fairly dull as well, such as the ever-present tailing missions, an unfortune standby for the series. It's got some good spectacle to it, but I'm not really happy at having such an expensive paperweight just sitting in my library.",

            "review_text": "Assassin's Creed IV is the game that Assassin's Creed III should have been. You know... like, actually good and stuff. In that way, it's somewhat similar to the drastic change in quality from AC1 to AC2. Assassin's Creed III had some good ideas, including changes to the controls and overall formula, but ultimately just wasn't as good as the previous games (not to mention it was also buggy as all hell). AC4 takes the improvements that AC3 tried to make and actually implements them - with nary a bug in sight. I suppose it also helps that the setting and main character are far more interesting as well. I mean, seriously... who doesn't dig pirates and adventure on the high seas? You play as privateer Edward Kenway - neither Assassin nor Templar - thrust into the middle of both of those worlds. Edward is one of the better protagonists in the series, and is generally quite likeable.  The one huge difference that sets Black Flag apart from previous games in the series is its setting - well over half the game takes place on the ocean. And what an ocean it is... seriously, it is huge. And sailing on it is just so very cool. The closest comparison I can make is to exploring the ocean in the Wind Waker on Gamecube back in the day, only much bigger and more realistic. The exploration element alone is great. However, what really sets AC4 apart is the way it looks and feels. In terms of video game technology, it's just amazing what they were able to pull off. You can almost actually feel like you're out on the ocean, as waves and wind make your ship swerve, sway and dip (and just wait until you see all the gorgeous weather effects). I can't imagine any game ever nailing seafaring better than this... (well, at least not until virtual reality sailing comes along). It just feels great. Naval combat also plays a big part in the game. Unfortunately, as fun as it can be, it does have a few problems. You control your weapons by changing the perspective of the camera (look to the ship's side to fire cannons, or to the rear to drop fire barrels, for example). This is all well and good, in theory, but in the heat of battle with multiple enemies, it can get a bit dodgy. By the end of the game, you should have a good handle on it, but it isn't always the easiest thing to manage. By far, the coolest part of combat is boarding other ships. There are no loading screens on the ocean. Ever. This means that any ship you see (and all of the crew members on it) can be engaged in real time, at any time. If you want to jump off your ship and swim to a frigate and kill every dude on board all by yourself, you can do that. If you want to incapacitate a ship with your cannons, get alongside, board it by swinging on a rope and air-assassinating the captain from one of the masts, you can do that. It is very, very fun. But as with anything, repetition will eventually cool those initial highs and you may start to tire of the whole process by the time the latter parts of the game roll along. This is more an inevitability than a knock on the game itself, but should be mentioned. Rounding out the new additions to the series, Black Flag introduces a set of underwater diving locations. These are mostly optional and don't really make or break the game one way or the other. They are just 'meh', mostly due to the horrible controls inherent with underwater segments in every game with underwater segments ever made. Ever. There are some cool bits underwater, but these segments could have easily been excluded and it still would have been a decent game.  The other half of the game takes place in land-based locations, and follows the standard AC series formula. You take on various missions to gather information or assassinate people, which require either stealth, combat, or both. Free-running and climbing also return and are generally OK, though the usual issues (like climbing onto things you aren't trying to climb onto in the heat of the moment) are still ocasionally present. Combat is similar to previous games as well. Mostly all you need to do is button mash and use counters or break enemy defenses at the appropriate moments. As simple as it is, it is still ever so satisfying, due to the insane number of moves you can pull off in various situations - put simply, you are a serious badass. There is also a very limited number of different weapons available (contrary to previous games), which is a welcome change. There's no longer 3 inventory screens' worth of pointless weapons you'll never use. Early on, you'll be able to buy a good set of swords and pistols. Those, along with your hidden blades, are pretty much all you'll ever want or need for the majority of the game. The land-based segments take place in 3 major locations - Havana, Nassau and Kingston. Additionally, there are a number of smaller islands scattered around the ocean that contain fishing villages, ruins, and more. Overall, it's a nice balance between traditional AC and the newer naval bits.   The last part of the package is a sub-plot that continues the goings-on in the modern-day time period. With Desmond out of the picture (mostly), you play as an unnamed employee in the game division of the Abstergo Corporation. I don't mind these sections too much, but for those of you who don't care about these present-day bits, just know that most of these sections are optional, and the parts that are required can be done pretty quickly. The optional activities available involve 'hacking' a bunch of computers, which unlocks various bits of lore and info on what has happened since the events of the previous game. If you are into following that part of the series, some of it is pretty interesting. Otherwise, these optional bits can simply be ignored.   Overall, I found this to be a worthy entry in a series I thought was on its last (peg?) legs. The amount of things to do is pretty insane, and I found almost everything to be pretty dang fun. That said, I am also somewhat easy to please, and kind of anal when it comes to games that have any kind of collecting aspect... so take that opinion for what it's worth. A lot of how much you enjoy this game will depend on how much you dig the new seafaring aspect, since it is such a large portion of the experience. I can see how it might be hit or miss for some people. If you liked the naval missions in AC3, then you will most definitely enjoy the improvements Black Flag makes in that area. If you hated those missions, I hesitate to recommend AC4 wholeheartedly (though you very well may still enjoy it). If you've never played an AC game before, or haven't played one in a long time, this is a great one to jump into the series with. It's definitely not perfect, but it's pretty solid overall. I'd rank it up there with the better games in the AC2 era. I'd give it a B+ or A-.",

            "review_text": " What is the franchise about and what is the game like?   Simply put: Like the Batman Arkham franchise in historical costumes. Third person parcour, forgiving stealthy or go loud game, which is not meant to completely run &amp; gun. I played the first two tittles before Black Flag. Here is my impression on this one:   What remained:   - Beautiful, large open world. - Great atmosphere - Love to detail regarding historical costumes. - Senseless meta story - Repetitive elements - Nice puzzle minigames entering terminals. Though to a lesser extent than the previous episodes had. - As with the other parts: Too many collectibles, simply to inflate playtime.   What improved:   - Naval battles are fun and intuitive, capturing an enemy's vessel is great. - Key bindings for PC players make more sense and are easier compared to AC1 &amp; 2. - The shanty catching quests are a worthy replacement for the race ontop of the roofs parcour challenges.   What got worse:  - Berserk darts are simply game-breaking due to their long range. The poison syringe in AC2 already made things a lot easier, but this is an overkill. Besides, the animations are far more boring and it makes no sense that someone on a berserk dart kills the own people but spares civis. Was much more fun in AC2. - Second point is the new climbing system, which might have been introduced together with AC3: It is beautiful, if you can leap seemlessly from branch to branch in the forests, but the same mechanics let you clinch on every corner or jump ontop of treasure chests, you simply wanted to open up. This was always a problem but since the parcour part used to be a little harder w/o this change, that glitch didn't happen that often before. - The corruption of statistical information, aka 'progress tracker'. Now even subquests are added to the main story's tracker and some values like collectibles are counted double (as 'location' and as 'side activity')! This slows the progress increase down for a looong time. - Ok, eavesdropping events are a staple of the franchise, but this has gone overboard to me with this one. Same goes for the tail-your-man missions.  - Skins, impossible to use, because they were rewards of long-gone community challenges? Unbelievable!  What I like about this franchise is that real contemporary characters (mere commoners, not just the famous ones) are picked according to their value to the story. So the backstory to these characters is always authentic, like a merchant turned pirate or a nun opening up a brothel in Renaissance Italy. The story is the same since part 1 though and quite incoherent this time. These contemporary characters are rather thrown in than fitted in nicely: Ok, the barmaid turns pirate for the looks of it, but Adewale complaining   about searching for a fairy tale castle, though he should be most appreciative of the whole crew, being an assassin?    Outfits which contain stat boosts are meh, if I can't choose them and simply add the boost. Most of the time, the puffy native Indian outfit is the most useful, which is sad indeed. The rope darts are given for the last 20% of the main story and nobody knows why, since there is anyway enough to make this game far easier than the previous parts.  But what an amazing game this could have been, if the marketing department had less of a say in it! The real meta story of the game, which was well fit in between all the character information is the battle between devs and marketing department which was added as some ironic side twist in a form of managerial comments: 'Should we mention slavery? People want to hear postive stuff...' - This picking on stupid marketing department phrases makes this game really worthwhile - besides it is an enjoyable but repetitive game.   If it wasn't for the nice Caribbean environment and the cool navy battles, this part would be worse than AC2. ",

            "review_text": "I think the running around parts got, if anything, slightly worse... tailing people is less interesting since blonde pirates have X-Ray vision, and aside from that there's not much new to it other than grenades and more hiding spots. However, the game also introduces the whole sailing thingamabob, which is the most actiony rendition of sailing a big hulking ship I've ever seen.  Story-wise, the pirate main character is quite different from the previous protagonists, which is refreshing and fun, but the present-day parts do a bad job at convincing me to be interested in the new impending apocalypse that Desmond replaced the old one with at the end of the last game. Perhaps that's why they stopped numbering them after this one: because they too couldn't be bothered to care about the modern-day plot any more.",

Totaly like the dual cutlass. The main focus is on the sea where you travelled between islands with your ship, the Jackdaw. You can upgrade and customize your ship. Now the secondary objectives only applies to the story mission. You can play on the sea all day long pirating, attacking ships, plundering, harpooning, diving etc. The music is great too, especially the Jackdaw's 'radio'. The Kenway's Fleet minigame is good for extra income and you can play it with your smart devices by installing their app. Multiplayer is awesome as always. It got Game Lab mode which allows you to customize a game. Wolfpack coop mode also got improved.  The parts that I don't like is lack of weapons. In this game, you only have cutlass and hidden blade for combat. No small weapons anymore like previous game. But you got pistols, 4 of them which is good. Assassination missions are same and boring, but the final reward is awesome (pistol sword FTW XD). No more silent ranged assassination since no bow or crossbow. Dunno pirates don't like bows. The main villain didn't get much spotlight and kinda forgettable. Collecting uncharted chests and Animus fragments is a hassle.  This game deserve 9/10. Totally worth it.",

The combat is awesome (Infantry and Naval) and there are some really good elements to the game such as, recruiting pirates, taking over other ships and then choosing what you can do with the wreckage of the ship ( Repair, Destroy and so on) This really does add to the game in an awesome way  There is a couple of problems involving minor detail for example, The death animations of the guards and enemies are broken... For example, you kill a guard near a wall and his foot goes through the wall playing the death/execution animation after you have killed him and in order the the corpse to ragdoll it need to go in to the ragdoll physics, in the ragdoll physics you will see that the foot has got cought in the wall and makes the guard glitch out. It's amusing to see but kind of annoying at the same time.  Over all I rate it 8/10 because it is awesome but not perfect. Thank you for reading my review.  ",

            "review_text": "First of all, if you read my rantview of AC3, you know a lot of what I thought was wrong about it.  This game basically fixed all of that. It's a much more logical progression of the series than AC3's 'here's a bunch of half-baked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that doesn't matter and will be used as a one-off that we don't ever ♥♥♥♥ing explain'. There's actually a reason to do things, and -- holy shitballs -- those things are actually ♥♥♥♥ing explained.  I know that Ubi has different teams working on AC. This is the A team's game. The B team made AC3, and ♥♥♥♥ me does it show. This game is everything AC3 should have been, plus it has ♥♥♥♥ing shanties. SHANTIES. SHANTIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.  Yes, you're a pirate. Yes, you get a ship. Yes, it's fun to board other ships, steal them, send them to your fleet, etc. Yes, you get to run around stabbing mens from the rooftop. Yes, there's still a modern-day storyline included for no particular reason other than to make you really, really appreciate the REAL game. But shanties are the most important thing in this ♥♥♥♥ing game. There are other things to collect, sure, but SHANTIES. Shanties are to 18th century sailing (AND PIRATES) what ♥♥♥♥ing shooting things is to video games. Inseparable. Natural. Right. SHANTIES.  Seriously, though, the shanties are AWESOME and since you spend so much time sailing around the Caribbean you might as well listen to them. If you don't collect all the shanties you are a bad pirate and I don't like you, but you will also get REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING TIRED of hearing the same handful of shanties over and over again. Collect the shanties both to be the piratey-est pirate that ever pirated things, and to save yourself from hearing Sally Brown about 50,000 times. Shanties.  Beyond SHANTIES, there's actually a good game here. There's hunting, but it's not the stupid, unexplained and utterly useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that it was in AC3. Bonus: it's optional. You can buy the skins needed if you don't want to sail to bumble♥♥♥♥ nowhere to get two monkey hides for whatever the ♥♥♥♥ upgrade you're looking at, when you're just sitting on a pile of ♥♥♥♥ing money. (See, AC3? This ♥♥♥♥ isn't hard, you ♥♥♥♥ing waste. Now go back in the ♥♥♥♥ing corner so I can continue pretending that you don't ♥♥♥♥ing exist.)  The ship stuff is pretty awesome. The controls are a refined version of what was in AC3, except now there's actually a ♥♥♥♥ing reason to sail the ♥♥♥♥ing ship, unlike 'Assassin's Creed Seriously, who the ♥♥♥♥ developed this? A room full of syphilitic monkeys? 3'. You get a crazy armament, as well. The Jackdaw (that's your baby) has to be the heaviest-armed brig in the ♥♥♥♥ing world. You get not just your broadsides (which can ultimately be upgraded to have 23 guns per side), but also mortars, fire barrels, and a ♥♥♥♥ing ram. That's right, you can ♥♥♥♥ing ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then rock out like it's the 3rd century BC. By game's end, your little ship is taking out ♥♥♥♥ing full-sized warships that quite literally dwarf you as if it's no big deal. Such is the power of the shanty. Did I mention you can make it pretty? You can make it pretty. Then you can ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s some more, while being pretty.  The only real downside to the ship game is that eventually most of the challenge goes out of it. You can throw money at most of the ship upgrades, but the upper-tier ones are all locked behind a need to find plans scattered throughout the world. Some are found in buried treasure chests -- because what would a pirate game be without buried treasure -- while some come from exploring sunken wrecks. The wreck stuff is, honestly, kind of tedious and occasionally annoying. ♥♥♥♥ sharks, that's all I'm going to say. It's not impossible, and it's not outright bad (*coughAC3huntingcough*), but there's not a hell of a lot to it. The only real variation in the sunken stuff is that you occasionally find a smuggler's cove and then you have to Batman the ♥♥♥♥ out of the bad men in there, because you don't have your full armament. That stuff is pretty cool.  Anyway, back to the ship. Once you gather enough cash, resources (cloth/wood/metal, gained primarily from capturing prizes on the open waves), and plans, your little ship becomes an unstoppable juggernaut that ♥♥♥♥♥ all over every ship on the sea regardless of size or apparent strength. The one exception to this is the 'legendary' ships, which are firmly optional. They offer big rewards, but by the time you're strong enough to actually take them on the rewards are utterly meaningless. They exist primarily for bragging rights, and you have to approach each with a particular strategy, so at least there's more depth to them than the standard 'poop out doom at the ship until you can board it, then repeat' nature of the naval game later on.  As a quick aside, it's really ♥♥♥♥ing weird that when you stop to board a ship every other hostile ship just stops attacking you and sort of stands by to watch. Understandable from a gameplay standpoint, but still very odd; doubly so when you realize that you can cripple a ship, wait until you're severely damaged, run back to the crippled ship to board and capture her and then use her to repair your ship back to fighting shape WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE. It's strange and unrealistic, but I'll give it to them because, hey, at least it's not AC3 (no, I'm not going to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on AC3 -- ever).  The story is what it is. I won't spoil anything, other than to say that the protagonist is actually enjoyable and not a huge ♥♥♥♥ing whiny, irrational and wooden ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that anyone with a ♥♥♥♥ing brain would've simply dragged out back and shot in the ♥♥♥♥ing face to save the human race from having to deal with him. Edward is awesome, although his character development, if you don't pay attention to the dates, can seem really oddly paced. Edward is a pirate's pirate. Even the way that he gets involved with the Assassins is awesome, and the completely unnecessary and stupid hours-long intro of AC3 is nowhere to be found. You get some short backstory, then it's PIRATE TIME with PIRATEY PIRATE THE PIRATE as your protagonist. He even ends up seeming human and rational, if self-centered. Dude's a pirate.  All in all, definitely worth your time.   Incidentally, the first real DLC, Freedom Cry, is also pretty damned good. Not exactly the longest thing, but you get to play as Kenway's quatermaster (read: first mate), Adewale, and he uses a ♥♥♥♥ing machete while running about stabbing men. A machete. There's a kill animation where he hacks it into a man's knee and then LEAVES IT THERE while he punches him in the face. So yeah, worth it if you like the main game, but not terribly long (which is probably a good thing, to be honest).",

This is a perfect recovery after AC3 and is one of best AC games to date. The only AC games that kept my interest long enough to actually finish were AC1, AC2, AC: Brotherhood and this AC. The story is amazing and meeting infamous, half-drunk pirates like Blackbeard, Horningold, Kidd, Rackam and etc never gets old. Their personalties make the cutscenes worth watching and the dialouge interesting.   For me, the most important aspect of a game is story and characters. In AC3, Connor was very unlovable and I was always apatheic towards his situation. As for Edward Kenway, he is the epitome of a pirate character. He is charming, charismatic and extremely lovable even when he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You relate to him, feel sorry for him and desperately want him to outlive all his fast-going pirate comrades. The end of this game is also heartwarming and is extremely satisfying, leaving the player wanting more Kenway.   In a world run by anarchy, debauchery and betrayal, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the epitome of a pirate experience.",

The main charater's name is Edward Kenway, father of Haytham Kenway which you met in Assassin's Creed 3. He leaves home for a pirate life, hoping for great fortune and riches, but it turns out to be a more bumpy ride than he first had thought.  After some missions you will get your own ship, which you can upgrade by increasing the number of cannons, the armor of your ship, mortar cannons, a battering ram so you can crash into enemy ships and so on. The game encourages you to sail around and fight other ships, board them and steal their cargo in order to upgrade your ship with metal, wood, cloth and money. Rum and suger can be sold to get even more money.  When you destroy enough ships you will get more wanted stars, the more stars you get the stronger pirate hunters will be spawned, and they will hunt you until you manage to remove the stars.  The seas are vast and there is loads of stuff to do, be it gathering mayan secrets for something to be revealed, or following treasure maps and finding your treasure. And don't worry, after completing the main story you can still sail around and do these things.  And if you are done with the main story or everything, what I love to do is to put on some epic Pirates of the Carribean music while sailing!  However this is still an Assassin's Creed game, so you will still be doing missions quite similar to the previous games. Like 'Tail the target', 'eavesdrop the conversation', 'kill target', 'escape area and become anonymous' and so forth. But there are also missions where you sail with your ship to destroy another enemy ship.  The main story is worth completing, because it is really entertaining and you will meet many interesting and cool characters, the ending was to me quite touching in different ways. If you (like me) doesn't like the 'new futuristic world' where you sit in a machine, then there is both a positive and negative side. The negative side is that you are in a kind of machine.  The positive side is that they have removed many of the animations inside the world where it continously remind you that you are not in the world, in the previous games you would see things manifest around you like you were in a machine, you don't see it as much in this game. And you are only drawn out of the world about 5 times. So because of this I feel that this is an improvement.  I recommend this game to anyone that is interested in the pirate life, sailing around in your own ship, fighting the royal navy or pirate hunters! This is without a doubt my favorite Assassin's Creed game so far!",

Pros: &gt; Beautiful graphics if your computer can handle it. &gt; Naval warfare is fun and can almost be a standalone game. &gt; Storyline is solid, voice acting is great. &gt; Makes me want to dress like a pirate.  Cons: &gt; UPLAY is mandatory, buying through steam does not prevent UPLAY from having to load. &gt; UPLAY cloud saving is AUTOMATICALLY DISABLED for this game. It does not tell you anywhere except on the forums. &gt; UPLAY account creation is poorly designed. When I created the account I typed in my email wrong. Yes, I know this was my fault, however most account creation programs have you enter your email twice to verify you did not have any typos. The UPLAY software does not. Be advised, this is apparently on par for the standards of laziness you will ecounter using anthing UBISOFT. Just go over and read the forums. I will note however that the phone tech support guy was 10/10 rated and helped me out without incident. He sounded like an old college buddy and treated me very nice and was super knowledgeable and friendly.  &gt;Minimum specs are much higher than other games. My laptop struggles to handle it and it is not very playable. Laptop WEI Proc ------------ 6.6 Mem ----------- 5.9 Gam Graphics -- 6.2  My desktop which averages 7.7 has no problem with it. It is strange because I can play games like Batman AA and Insurgency with no issues. AC4 BF wont play good even on the lowest settings. I have AMD Crossfire which may be the culprit - I wouldn't put it past Ubisoft to make it suck for AMD since they are running promos with NVIDIA.    ",

Graphically beautiful, the textures are high enough resolution that they don't look like a bleary mess when objects are near the camera, godrays are exaggerated enough to be atmospheric but not enough to be intrusive on gameplay, lighting and shadow in general are beautiful and the water is gorgeous despite a few trifles, particularly when you're out at sea and all of these factors combine, the sun shining through your sails and refracting through the waves. TXAA does its job correctly as well. I've rarely seen a game that looks this nice unmodded, though it obviously doesn't stack up to the likes of, say, Crysis 3.  While the freerunning is a bit sloppy as in past titles, it's easily manageable, and the handful of forced stealth missions in the game are compensated for by a fair share of naval combat missions.  Most of the time I've spent on the game has been sailing, capturing ships, sieging forts, whaling, hunting and collecting the various collectibles strewn around the Caribbean, and it's these things that I've enjoyed the most about the game. I would say the games' strongest points are its appearance and theming, and most of the aforementioned activities build into the latter, setting a distinctly swashbuckling mood.  Against the game are a cheesy plot and a reliance on quick time events for encounters with predatory wildlife, particularly sharks which are moderately difficult to avoid and cannot be dealt with in any other way. These aren't big concerns for me. The game also has a definite point where there isn't much left to do, the story is completed, everything there is to be collected is had and you've seen every bit of the world and conquered every enemy, but that isn't a complaint so much as what's there, which has been over 175 hours' worth in my case, being good enough that I want more.",

It's not like a minigame thrown together. - The map is vast, but not needlessly so. Huge, where everything still feels like it belongs and has a purpose.  Cons: - I didn't like the 'real world' pieces outside of the 18th century that all AC games tend to throw you into. It felt like busy work and the story was not interesting enough to make me want to do any of these things. - The underwater exploration parts of the game felt tedious, and unfortunetly all the major ship upgrades require you to do some of these. The least fun part of the game in my opinion. - I would have liked to see harder ship battles beyond the high-level 'man o' war' war gallions. The legendary ships were decent, but when you destroy those you're basically the king of the sea, and nothing feels threatening anymore.",

The art within Abstergo Entertainment was amazing; especially the entry lobby. The art within the animus was amazing too. There were very minor glitches in graphics, physics and positioning but it was so minor you most likely will not notice it and it does not happen during the main mission neither.

Ubisoft took the elements that made AC a good series and mixed them with the open world features that made the success of Farcry 3.  The pirate setting is one of my favorites, and is very well represented here, with likable characters, a vast sea area full of islands and hidden treasures, as well as enemy ships to sink or board. The story is pretty good, although I'm only at 15% of progression. It's easy to get distracted by the big number of side activities. You don't have to do them all, you pick what you want, when you want it. I think that AC4 can be fun for different types of gamers in different ways.  On the technical side, the game is pretty, with detailed models, textures and lush environments. The water/waves simulation is impressive and makes the navigation and naval combat or hazzards (like storms) quite realistic and fun. The PC optimization could be better, although I think it runs pretty well on my laptop with i7, Geforce 680M, SSD and 8GB RAM, around 45-60 FPS.  I encountered no bugs or crashes so far, although the Ubisoft servers were down once, which prevented me to use the (minor) fleet system in the solo game.  The multiplayer modes are the same as previous games, although you now have the possibility to define your own rules and create your own game modes to play with others. I like some of the multiplayer modes, but prefer the solo experience of AC4 a lot more. In previous AC games, it was the opposite for me.  I recommend this game to anyone, even those who didn't like the AC series. It's worth a try as the sea gameplay is completely different and the game world is much more open now.",

Beautiful game too, the setting was absolutely gorgeous, islands, jungles, under water caves all fantastic.

I did have to use the D3DOverrider fix to get a solid 60FPS with everything maxed. Everyone knows the AC games so there is no need to go into details about gameplay however the lack of daggers really upset me, they have always been my weapons of choice in any AC game and they are completely nonexistent here BOOO. For those that like the Animus stuff (I love it) there are plenty of very cool tidbits of information if you go around hacking each machine.

Cons: - A bit laggy if you have a lower end PC or laptop. - Story didn't catch my interest. - Kenway's Fleet* was fun at first but then started to feel like a chore. - I wasn't interested in what I saw of the present storyline (but it might get better.) - Multiplayer didn't have anything to do with ships.

Fleet management, taking ships, boarding ships, sinking ships, sending them on trade convoys and intense nautical combat. Great gameplay for using chain shots, mortars, broadsiding with round shot and you could even just leap off the masts and kill the enemy vessel's crew manually with your assassin skills. Like any AC game, it has the annoying modern sub-plot of the real world where you work in a gaming company with some underhanded crap going on where you walk around the office staring at french lady coworker's butts in miniskirts, but it really doesn't force you to play that sub plot much.

            "review_text": "Best friggin pirate game of all time. Like a full live action version of Sid Meier's Pirates based on an Assassin's Creed engine. I honestly didn't care for the AC series that much, but this one is a level of insane awesomeness I can sink my teeth into. Lots of lush jungle and city environments in the Caribbean from desert islands to full cities like Havana and Nassau. Fleet management, taking ships, boarding ships, sinking ships, sending them on trade convoys and intense nautical combat. Great gameplay for using chain shots, mortars, broadsiding with round shot and you could even just leap off the masts and kill the enemy vessel's crew manually with your assassin skills. Like any AC game, it has the annoying modern sub-plot of the real world where you work in a gaming company with some underhanded crap going on where you walk around the office staring at french lady coworker's butts in miniskirts, but it really doesn't force you to play that sub plot much. I just stay logged into the pirate simulation 24/7. Screw John from IT, I'm a pirate! The awesome collectable pirate shanties that your crew sings as you sail are stuck in my head now. Coworkers are confused why I know so many sailing songs. Literally a full hour of pirate shanties.",

            "review_text": "Assassin's Creed 4 is a great game. Full stop. If you've seen the gameplay and the trailers you will be thinking 'Wow! Amazing!' It is indeed so, with a great deal of pirating and exploration to do. Free-running is now much smoother, especially with the trees, which AC3 tried to introduce, but had many bugs. The combat system is easy to use and very fluid in getting killstreaks. Ship combat is also fun, with the freedom to attack anyone you want, and consequently board them however you want. There are numerous locations in the game to explore and traverse, with varying sizes and feels to them.  The storyline is interesting, as Edward Kenway is ______(sorry won't spoil it for you). He is looking for The Observatory, the purpose of which I will not reveal to you, dear readers, other than it being a precursor site, it's location sought after by both the Assassins and the Templars. But Edward thinks he can make money out of it,. In that sense, I don't like him as much as Ezio, as he is not noble and honourable in the classic way, standing up for his creed, instead he is driven to work for the highest bidder (you will see what I mean).  In present-day, you are a new employee for Abstergo Entertainment - a front for Abstergo (duh!) and the Templars. It is now first-person, and you must roam around, hacking other employees' computers for very interesting info and searching for secrets (sticky notes). It is a change from previous present day missions, which is sad, as it was a nice experience to run around as Desmond, especially in AC3.  However, I do detect 'faults' in this game, as it is less than I hoped it to be (do not let my criticisms sway your ideas - I am what one would 'define' as a 'hardcore' AC gamer, who -stereotypically- thinks that AC2 was the best and will remain so):   - I expected the Caribbean to be totally free roam, which some may argue that it is anyway, but I hoped for every single island to be accessible. There are still very many locations, but there are also many islands in the game just for the scenery.  - Also, I almost find the game 'too easy'. If you focus on exploring without doing may missions - as most of the World is open to you from the start - then it can almost become boring as you are too powerful - but some may view this as good. Therefore, it is my advice to you that you should stick to the storyline until you have acquired the diving bell, then you may explore more - if you do very little of the storyline and then fully upgrade your ship - it is simply boring as it is far too easy - I would have liked a dynamic difficulty to resolve this issue.  - it is fun to pillage and loot ships - there are three choices to choose from when you board a ship and complete the necessary objectives to capture the ship: Either repair your ship, send the ship t your fleet (equivalent to Assassin's den - where you send them on missions - but now it is with ships), or you can lower your wanted level (equivalent of notoriety). This is also annoying that there is no longer a notoriety for you when on foot - you no longer have to pull down posters, bribe speakers, or kill officials to lower the notoriety (which I miss, as it added another level of difficulty) - now all you have to do is lower your wanted level in the sea by bribing a random guy next to the harbourmaster on shore or by capturing a ship. If you let the notoriety increase, more and more powerful pirate hunters will chase and attack you, which is actually mostly annoying  - it is also a controversial point for me concerning how the ship upgrades. It would have been nice if there was a slight RPG system, where you could choose a path for your ship to follow, whether to become faster, or to become stronger, or bigger, etc.  - There is a wide range of locations, but they don't have the same 'majesty' of the classical cities in the previous games, specifically AC2. Furthermore, some of the smaller locations are relatively boring to travel in, as they follow a single path through the treetops or around Mayan temples. In this sense, I loved the Frontier in AC3, as it was a complete expanse to freeroam  - Mission styles vary in the game, being both on land and out in the sea. The new eagle vision is nice, but it is overpowering, in the sense that one can see enemies through walls and buildings, which sort of eliminates the point of following or eavesdropping, as you can see the targets through the wall. On top of this, blending in with the crowd is a less prominent tool on missions - I have barely done that at all.  In conclusion, I believe that although AC4 is a good game, with fun elements to it, there are concepts and mechanics from previous titles which have unfortunately been altered or unused (e.g. blending, notoriety, high &amp; low profiles). However, as I said before, do not let this bias affect you too much, as these are merely ideas from a long-running fan of the Assassin's Creed series. ",

Very well done, and even the tiny details were thought out (like rainbows forming when viewing mists / falls with the sun in the background). Beautiful scenes.  As for the story, I was less impressed. It was more of the same mechanics from AC3, with carbon copies of items, houses, etc; ... and yes, those board games. They are ALL back; though you don't have to do rediculous things with them anymore. As for the main storyline -- it is weak, and I didn't like it -- they tried to force piracy into the Assassin's Creed and draw out some similarities to make a bridge so that when Edward did start running with the Assassin's, you would believe it. The entire time I kept calling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It was out of character for Edward, as well as for the Assassin's. Seems like they fixed the naval battles though, so the ones you need to do for the plot can't be 'upgraded past' (this happened in AC3 where your ship would be so upgraded that the mission would be very hard because you would insta kill instead of disabling ships).  I'm all for being pulled out of the animus for breaks between chapters, but in 4 they took this too far. So many minigames and collectibles, that I felt the outside stuff was a chore just to get to 100% completion.   Grinding is a problem in this game. I finished the game with all of my equipment / weapons upgraded, but forgot to tackle Kenway's fleet -- which means I am basically logging into the game every other day to check on mission progress (which is multi-day real-time missions). It sucks. It's grindy, and it has no affect on you except for pointless artifacts for your base and unlocks that you must get for 100%. Chests and animus fragments were a chore too. Legendary ship battles are insanely difficult and not really worth the reward -- again, don't even bother with them unless your ship is fully upgraded and you want to spend a day in frustration.  On that note, the social sharing for rare finds is terrible. This mechanic allows you to share rare finds with your friends, which gives them a chance to find them as well. This is only enabled during community events (which is never explained or shown). I've put 82 hours into the game and have found 3. (A community event is set in the Initiates site, which you then have to meet the requirements for the rare stuff to trigger.  acinitiates.com  with your uplay account).  Edit: Turns out they've disabled social stuff until it is patched, expected in January.  Must be played with a controller.  All in all, a solid game. Stick to the main missions and don't worry about the out-of-animus crap, collectibles and other junk unless you are going for 100%  4/5",

The Assassin's Creed games have become a little stale over the last few years and being an annual franchise has basically turned it into another 'Call of Duty' for me. Having said that, it's like the pirate game iv'e always wanted but never got. The pirate part is where it truely shrines and if if Ubisoft was smart they'd listen to the fans that think as I do and make their own stand alone pirate game. I love the Creed games but there hasn't been enough innovation lately to keep me really interested for a long time, until this game. They did it right here because it was something fresh and had new mechanics such as true open world gameplay and brings back the sailing mechanic from ACIII, but making it 10 times more enjoyable this time around. Sailing around the Caribbean plundering and pillaging ships, settlements, and hidden coves alike was an exciting and new take on the series and is by far my favorite part of this game. They also have an interesting story to tell which involves famous pirates from history including the notorious Blackbeard. Once again the pirates is where the draw to this game is for me and i couldnt get enough of it. Here's hoping they hear those of us asking for more and give us the pirate game we deserve thats not held back by the now lackluster assassin story. 9/10  Edit: So here I am a couple years later and my opinion hasn't changed on this game. It's still the best pirate game out there and while I feel for the people that hated the pirate aspect and just wanted a good assassin game, I want a good assassin game as well, I still feel like we need more AAA pirate games and this game still beats everything else out there in my book. Having said that, I think this game deserves a 10/10 now because it's stood the test of time so far as the best.",

            "review_text": "Shortest:  Go play Sid Meier's Pirates.   In short: You sail your ship, fight with other ships with cannons, board the ships and fight in a TPS mode with swords, land on islands and in town, where you again control yourself and do repetitive, boring missions, you hunt wild animals to create holsters for pistols and armor upgrades, you manage your fleet and send them on mission via a panel but you cannot actually see the ships nor change your flagship - you cannot control that beautiful frigate, no, you are stuck with your brig for the entire duration of the game. When you fast travel, your ship might turn upside down and you might have to start the whole game anew. Dozens of problems like this one below.  MY EXPERIENCE:  Ah. Another AC. Well, I never liked the watered-down console mechanics... Hm, pirates should be interesting. Alright, let's download it at discount.  Ah, another Steam inside a Steam. Uplay. Brilliant. Just what I need. Main menu... Jaysus, what console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   Alright, a fight... ah, stranded on an island. Ok. Some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over-the-top parkour in a jungle... sigh. Moving on. Oh, first fight. Some more fighting. Typical AC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te - mash your left mouse button more so than in Diablo, and you should be off. Sigh. Oh, Jaysus, you can ONLY dual wield swords. Akimbo cutlasses. Jaysus. This game was obviously made for VERY stupid 10-year-olds.   Ah, got me own bluddy ship. Finally something interesting - oh, no, back to the future. The pirating part of the game, which consists about 95% of the gameplay, is a presented as a game within a game: the remaining 5 % is set in the present time, where you work in a big, bad company and you enter the memories of your ancestors via Animus, a computer simulation. The company presumably makes video games, but actually wants to uncover secrets from the past through said memories, get super rich and dominate the world. Blah blah blah conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy   NO, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T, JUST LET ME BE A PIRATE!   Back to the game, finally. LET'S PLUNDAH, MATEYS- halt, a stealth mission. Ah, this is a stealth mission like 592 others in the game, but this time, I am not allowed to kill anyone, else the mission fails. Aye, I somehow sense they are good guys, so I should just knock out them. More sneaky sneaky jungle parkour ♥♥♥♥♥. Oh, a Mayan temple with insane, stupid parkour, how interesting. Oh, here come the Redcoats. Oh, kill a company of redcoats. Oh, free the good guys. Oh, the good guys tell me to feck off despite saving their skins. Oh, the stupidity.  ALRIGHT, SAIL THE SEAS AND ♥♥♥♥ THE MAIN QUEST! I AM A PIRATE!  A frigate! Man the cannons! Oh, it's right near the zone to enter the next story mission. Nevermind, I won't press the button. Dodge! Brace! Fire! Ram! Drive-by broadside! Repeat! Amusing 3 minutes.  After a hard battle, the frigate is in flames and I have to board it in order to capture the cargo and either send it to my invisible fleet, dismantle it to repair my ship, or release the crew to lower my wanted level. I press and hold the button for boarding, but my ship moves 5 meters forward and I enter the mission start zone. The functionality of the S key switches from ''board ship'' to ''begin mission''. The mission begins, and I lose the ship. Ragequit. Stupid console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te.  Play again.   I capture several ships, tons of cargo, thousands of gold pieces. That is not enough to buy a pair of good swords. Seriously?! Game developers should work on this generally. If you plunder 5 ships, sell 100 tons of rum and sugar, and you don't have enough money to buy several more cannons for your ship... If the plunder from a ♥♥♥♥ing ''Royal convoy'' frigate, obviously bound for its home nation and carrying immense wealth for the king, is not enough to buy a ♥♥♥♥ing pair of higher-grade swords, what are we talking about?! You should be able to buy 10 000 ♥♥♥♥ing swords with loot of THAT kind... Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Ah... another ''tail them'' mission... IT IS LOGICAL, I KNOW where the enemy commander of this island lives - in the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing house, on the hill overlooking the town, guarded by a platoon of soldiers! I don't have to tail this officer to his ♥♥♥♥ing house and remain undetected as I listen to his regular password-themed conversations with guards as well as regular guard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting about life, the price of beer, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sanitation. Quit.  Uninstally this ♥♥♥♥♥ and install Sid Meier's Pirates. IT IS BETTER.  Pros: When you kill a couple of whales and crocodiles or whatever it was (yes, ONLY specific animal skins can be used for various items) and craft two more holsters, it is cool to wield 4 pistols. Boarding was fun for the first 3 times. Sailing and listening to how your crew sings shanties (like modern military cadences). Capturing forts... for the first 3 times.  Cons: The unrealistic, over-the-top parkour. Seriously, what is too much is too much. The repetitivness of all kinds of missions. The inability to control multiple ships like in Sid Meier's Pirates. Seriously, Ubisoft, learn from a decade-old game. The inability to amass more than 40-50ish or whatever was the maximum of crewmen and tactically control them in fort battles, etc... like in Sid Meier's Pirates. The inability to choose your ♥♥♥♥ing flaghsip... like in Sid Meier's Pirates. If I want to sail a galleon, I'll sail a galleon; if I want to sail a sloop, I'll sail a sloop - no, you have the same ship the entire game. Bravo. The entire world conspiracy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te is getting really boring at this point. I don't want the main game to be a game within a game. I want to be a pirate.  The ancient Mayan and Astec temples' exploration would have been interesting without all the parkour.  More, less important...  Only dual-wielding swords. Come on... Seriously? The inability to remove the ♥♥♥♥ing pipe blowgun from your shoulder. I can't look like a serious pirate with that ♥♥♥♥ across my back... The inability to pick up the musket, or the warhammer, or grenades... etc. to use them permanently as weapons.",

I was pretty disappointed, I had high hopes for the new setting. Because of that I was pretty hesitant to get this game, but I ended up caving 'cause hey, pirates! But man I am SO glad that I did that. The game is far and away the most polished of the AC games, and features a more diverse setting. More or less half of the entire game takes place on water, which I was originally concerned for since I didn't care much for the naval campaigns of AC3. However, I was pleasantly surprised and the naval combat and exploration felt very smooth, interesting and refined compared to AC3. As a result of the almost 50/50 split between land and sea missions, the game also felt more varied and I found myself less likely to get bored by monotony during extended play. If you felt disheartened by AC3 and/or the past few AC games but enjoy the core idea of the series, definitely give it a go. The gameplay is not drastically differing from its predecessors but it is hugely improved upon, and the naval aspect is definitely a breath of fresh air. Apologies for the wall of text.",

Building upon the Naval Combat of AC3, Black Flag delivers the Best pirate sims since Sid Miers (Which is high praise). There is an incredible satisfaction when Black flag puts you on the helm of your ship and lets you loose on to pillage and plunder, with the tight combat mechanics of parry and destroy that has become a staple of the AC series. I have never been a giant fan of thier free run mechanic but if you like it then it is back with little if any change. Top all that off with an endless supply of islands and forts to explore and nice micro managing side piece and you will be hard pressed to ever not have somthing to be doing. My only major gameplay gripe is the ever present Follow quests, they were annoyong and tiresome in the previous ones and while Ubisoft has done so much good in this AC they still lean to heavy on this tired quest type.   I haven't had too many tech problems game runs at 35FPS on a modet rig with no big frame rate dips that I could see, so take that as you will. From lush jungles to the changing waves of the open seas, their clearly was a lot of attention to enviroment and I had my breath taken away a few times.   AC4 does a very good job of revitalizing a series that I felt was getting very stagnent and had lost me a few installments back. It's biggest set back still being the convoluted story of AC with some of it's outdated follow quest.

Being a Yorkshire man living in Swansea, it was nice to see some locl colour in an internationally renowed game franchise. I could open the window wide, let in the sea breezes; to imagine I was there sailing the seas plundering as I saw fit.  Until Uplay ruined it for me. What kind of people wouldn't let Steam Cloud Save backup their save files? Nevermind thought I, the Uplay cloud save should be alright. How wrong I was. After living my own little Groundhog Day scenario; restarting the same point of the game repeatedly, chasing down the same assasin repeatedly, and loosing a couple of progress repeatedly; I eventually disabled Uplay cloud save. I progressed in the game. Over 45 hours of pleasant piracy later I upgraded to Windows 10, with a clean install.  As I keep all my game data on separate partitions to the Windows data I was immediately able to fire up AC4, without downloading the game data again, for some rum and sun-soaked piracy. Or so I thought.  Once more, Uplay had conspired to ruin my life. For, you see, Uplay doesn't allow save games to be kept in the game data folder. So I figured it would be in the Games folder of My Documents (also kept on a separate partition) as other save data tends to be. But it wasn't there.  Turns out, Uplay is a hoarding little git, and keeps the save games in a folder in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Program Files directory. The one which had been wiped in the clean Windows install.  So yea, thanks a very effing much, Ubisoft. You've ruined a perfectly good game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attempts at what Valve already do seamlessly. And from what the internet has informed me, this has been a problem since AC2, or thereabouts. So it's not like the frustrated cries of customers have even reached you in your golden vault of don't-give-a-damn.  And after scouring my hard drives with undelete programs, I can't even restore the save file to the new save game directory.  Thanks a whole heap, Ubisoft. You've made what is possibly the most fantastic game I never want to play again. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.",

            "review_text": "After finishing the game, I honestly believe AC3 was a better AC game, and I played ALL the AC games, so I'm no noob to the series. At first I appreciated the gameplay changes, additions, graphics, the first act of the story, the exploration (but let's be honest, going to every single mini-island and going on a tedious collection spree got boring FAST), and naturally the improved and expanded ship mechanics.  But... The game kind of lacked something. The 2nd act of the story, which was pretty long, just felt like one huge 'meh'.  I won't complain about the character of Edward, but needless to say that by the time the 3rd act of the story rolled in, I was disliking him, preferring Connor over him by miles.  Yes, the 3rd act of the story was good enough to make me not lose all hope, and the reveal around 3/4 or 4/5 through the game in the modern setting was actually very nice and a bit unexpected for me, but...  In the end, having read Assassin's Creed: Forsaken (a canon book that is essentially Haytham Kenyway's journal from youth to his eventual death (that there is not a spoiler for AC3, technically, due to the fact that everyone dies eventually, ya know?)), I already knew exactly what happened with Edward in his later years, and how some of his character developement around the late parts of AC4 were simply gone, and overall..  The game just lacked an enticing cliffhanger, a twist, a hook for a sequel. Indeed, the modern day story has moved ahead very subtly, more so than Assassin's Creed: Revelations.  In fact, I dare say I'm actually pitting Black Flag with Revelations in a contest for the 'worst Assassin's Creed title in terms of story, narrative, and overall feeling after finishing the game'. (Edit: I meant talking about the modern day setting. The wrap up to Altair and Ezio were both excellent, forgive me for that.)  Edit 2: Actually you know what? Forget what I said about Revelations. The game ended rather well, it's the actual game itself that hardly felt like it was a step forward from Brotherhood, and how it was just all too similar in feel. The story was ok, I just hated the 1st person segments and the whole safe mode animus feel. It's Black Flag that stands alone with an unenticing ending, then.  That is to say, I do believe that when an Assassin's Creed game isn't very good, it's still pretty damn good, which is why I 99% the game (I'm missing 3 buries chests that can only be found by getting maps from Kenway's Fleet, and 1 glitched viewpoint I synced, by the game didn't count for me that I did, so unless that gets patched, my save will forever be bugged and will remain at 99%).  I did appreciate the content you could access while wandering around Abstergo Entertainment, though, particularly anything related to Desmond, and the Subject Zero tapes. Also, that single Subject One tape was quite an interesting look into seeing how it was in-universe for someone else to experience memories in the animus prototype, back when Warren Vidic had a young and EXTREMELY cocky voice, heh.  I just wished for more plot advancement in the modern day setting, that's all.  Overall, I'd rate this game high, and it's not quite the disappointment Far Cry 3 was for me (I rather not explain that in an AC4 forum), and I'm eagerly waiting for Freedom Cry, and even Liberation HD, so I can finally play the story of Aveline, and later actually allow myself to play the Aveline content in AC4. Yeah, I like story chronology, that's the way I am.",

            "review_text": "9/10. Has dethroned AC3 as my favorite game of the series.  The story is great, Edward Kenway is a very interesting character (a common complaint about Connor, while my opinion of Connor was mostly positive too). The only story that I feel they haven't elaborated enough, is the modern day section, where I feel there's been little progress since the events of AC3. That said, I do feel like they've added a LOT of content in the modern day section to flesh out the universe.  Stealth has been hugeley improved, especially compared to 3. There's also a bigger emphasis on stealth, with obviously more opportunities to be stealthy (more bushes, more haycarts, etc.). Enemy detection has also improved, no more random detection just because you were running too close to certain buildings, even while completely out of sight (AC3). There's still the odd moment where you can say 'he obviously sees me doing this', but hey.  Eagle vision has been slightly changed, where you can now tag up to 10 enemies so you can see them through walls. (people who have Far Cry 3 will be familiar with the system). This can help for stealth, and also for tailing missions (which are plenty, whether you like those or not is your opinion), since it's now easier to keep the target 'in sight' (your character doesn't need to keep the enemy in LoS).  Combat is slightly worse than AC3, and maybe the only thing I feel they haven't improved (and even made worse) compared to the previous game. While the same system is used, it's far less fun. Combat while boarding ships can also be very confusing, and Edward Kenway switches targets too often during combos (you'll hit a soldier twice, then suddenly decide to hit another one), which never happened in 3. Double counters and double kills are also very rare, and enemies seem to attack you with 3 at a time max. In conclusion: AC3's combat was fluid and satisfying, AC4's is clunky, and only satisfactory.  Naval combat has pretty much completely changed. While I enjoyed the way it worked in 3, it's certainly an improvement, if not simply a totally new system. it's straightforward, and rather fun. Boarding ships can ultimately get a little repetitive though.  Multiplayer is more of the same, Wolf Pack is mostly boring, and still easier to complete alone than with random people. The only positive thing I found in MP is that now contested kills actually cut the enemy's score in half (although there's a perk that cancels this too, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t). For those who enjoyed MP, they probably still will. I doubt I'll play much of MP for very long.",

Full story: Currently there is a bug with AC4: Black Flag that causes random losses of your saved data. I personally lost 10 hours of gameplay and thought it a random fault. Upon investigating this further on the forums I found this to be a -very- common problem with the PC port.  How a bug of this magnitude was not identified in testing after porting it from console to PC astounds me. I can only imagine if they are competent in the least they did find this in testing, which means they then knowingly released this game, for purchase, in a broken state.   I was angry losing 10 hours. I can only imagine how cheated the people who lost 85%+ completion felt.   The response I got from Uplay support was in essence 'Your data is gone, use a third-party game back-up tool, turn off cloud support, manually back-up regularly'. I have a massive problem with this for four reasons:  a) Using a back-up tool isn't going to get the lost data back that shouldn't have gone missing to begin with. b) This is a AAA title. Why on Earth are we expected to manually back-up our game saves ourselves?? It's your job to make sure the game is ready and able to save safely! c) This game is unable to save data safely with local content and cloud options? Even the NES cartidges did a better job. d) Why would I now play this game knowing that my data can be lost at any time? I wouldn't. It would be absurd to expect people to do so.  Guys, talking gameplay is moot point, because it is simply not worth playing when at any point you can lose -hours- of what you've played. There is a lot of content, and the thought of having to do it all again to catch up to where you were before is truly a soul crushing experience. Don't put yourself through it. Do not buy this game until it's creators have released a clear and offical statement saying this bug has been fixed.  Buying it anytime before that is simply helping them cheat you out of your own hard earned money.",

Ubisoft integrated this great story line where ubisoft and abstergo entertainment are teaming up to bring you these assassins creed games. Its a little confusing unless you play the game.

Sound is unreal, from the ambient sounds in the towns, down to the different sea shanties your crew will sing as you find them around towns and jungles.  The sea conbat has been refined from AC3, and made me want to just sail around blasting other ships for hours.  So far the story is kind of strange, as far as the Abstergo part. Dont want to spoil it.  The Pirate story is pretty well written, though im still not through close to even half of it (Sailing around battling bigger ships to use in my fleet is time consuming, as well as taking over forts). Voice acting is well done. I cant stand when a game has voices that dont match the character. None of that here.  The map size is... huge. But, its a LOT of ocean. There is still loads of activities and random ships and flotsam and wayward sailors, and random islands, and crap loads of other things to find.  The only part that i wasnt really pleased with was the Fleet missions. Although there is a mini game to play to make the routes 'safer', it just kind of seems tacked on. Dont get me wrong, i still laugh as i destroy a schooner with a fire barrel before even shooting the main guns on my bigger ships; i cant really explain why i dislike it other than i just think it feels like it was an afterthought. /shrug  Overall 9/10 would bang again",

Dont get me wrong though, the ship battles are amazing when it comes to gameplay and realism, somewhat, but the on foot fighting is just annoying, unfair, and overall just completely aggravating! Oh boy where do I start... For one, it's outstanding how many sword slashes the weakest enemies can take, and yes I know it's a videogame but just hear me out here. This is one of many games where you can shoot someone in the foot and they die instantly.. but they can take pretty much as many sword slashes as you want them to until you want to kill them. When boarding a ship your teammates get completely in the way when trying to do combos or trying to dodge. I'm not really sure if theres a way to disable them or if I just have to swim to the ship im trying to board after disabling it. And the way some enemies just come flying at you offscreen giving you about .5 seconds to react and press counter is completely unfair, especially when the red dot pops up when the enemy is half-way through the entire damn attack. Even sometimes when im fighting I randomly put my swords away and start using my fists. This really doesnt happen that much but I still wonder if it's a certain button im pressing.(Or Probably a Glitch) Sometimes when I try to attack an enemy it either doesnt lock on, I spam left click and my character is just standing there waving his swords, or the counter does'nt work because it's just happened to unlock my target at the perfect time. When fighting ACTUALLY WORKS this game probably makes it one of the most fun parts of the game. Sadly though it messes up more times than usually. It's a shame that one of the most things you do in the game is one of the most annoying. The stealth mechanic is really the best I've ever seen (up to date). Still a little bizzare how an enemy can clearly see me but at the same time not see me... It's understandable because no game has a perfect/realistic stealth mechanic because that would make the game somewhat unfair. AC4BF is probably the best AC game so far in my opinion though I honestly havn'nt played all of them. If you want to play an entertaining game that passes the time then this game is perfect for that. Overall I think they probably could've done a little better job with the gameplay; other than this, the game is amazing.    EDIT: Northwest Legendary Ship reaction: What. The. ♥♥♥♥. Am. I. Fighting.? I can guess how this SOB got it's name... but.. WTF IS THIS. This ship from the age of pirates has more power than modern day warships. It fires cannons like theres 10 miniguns loaded up onto one side of the ship built to drain your ships HP. Dont even get me started on the ram attack on this thing. How can a ship 5x bigger be 5x faster? This thing gives logic the middle finger. This ship makes my 100% maxed out Jackdaw feel like a damn schooner! The damn thing is so fast it can virtually make a full circle around you before you can reload your cannons. The difficulty on this thing is fair but do they honestly need to make it so fast? It already has the HP of about 4 maxed out Jackdaws. The only trick to beating these things is to just DONT. ♥♥♥♥. UP. because if you do then your HP will be drained faster than you can reload your flintlocks. (And this one isnt even an exaggeration)    PS: The Freedom Cry DLC sucked ♥♥♥ :p",

            "review_text": "Same old Assassins Creed game. The whole assassination, 3rd person kind of game hasn't evolved or really changed since the Endgame of Assassins Creed 2. Enemies are still walking around on Rooftops for no apparant reason. They ain't even looking for you, but still stand around on Rooftops. If police forces would have the habit of patroling roofs one would believe we had become accustomed to installing walkways.  The gameplay as assassin is boring. The fights lacking in challange and even the biggest brawls can still be won by pressing one button. On occassion there are counter resistant enemies so you have to strike them, and sometimes someone shoots at you, so you gotta grab (auto success of course) someone else as shield.  So now that you know you are in for the same boring Assassins Creed you have most likely become so bored off, it really annoys you just to think about playing, why would i recommend it?  This time around you play as Pirate, a pirate that isn't an assassin until the end game, when he finally gets recruited, but until then you get a ship to command and pirate the caribian seas on it. While boarding ships the boring Assassin type of combat is actually not that much of problem. You get objectives like cutting down the enemy flag, killing officers or the captain and occassionally you get called out to by one of your crew needing help. The later might not be an objective and is entirely optional, but helping these crewmen actually breaks the boring, repetitive mold of 3rd person fighting.  The whole Pirate Part is probably the best feeling at being a Pirate i had since Sid Maier's Pirates! to the degree where i wish it was more fleshed out. Yes, it takes up the majority of the game already, but its an Assassins Creed game after all. Its naval battles are fun, but once you have all the upgrades its as mindnumbingly easy as the land battles. I still got a good 70 hours out of it, got till almost the end (i lost interest in the story) and still occassionally jump into the game to sink some ships.  Despite it being the same old, same old, on land, i think the title is worth 30 bucks. So if you find it at that price, get it. The naval sections are really fun, so much fun i didn't even regret buying it for a much higher price, despite the loathing i've developed for the easy land gameplay.  Lack of choice and options make for 0 replayability, though. Oh and did i mention its mindnumbing easy? So easy, as someone that played all AC except 3, i got enough money from chests and enemies to buy the best sword in the game before i even got my ship. The naval map is divided into difficulties, which decide which ships will spawn in that area, allowing you some choice as to when to face harder ships. But leaving the naval battles aside, which as i said i so much enjoy to let me forget all the problems i have with the rest of the game, the game is really, really, really easy.  If one never has played any Assassins Creed game and wonders about starting into the series.. AC2 is still the best, since it has a really good storyline, but i'd pick this as 2nd choice after AC2, if AC2 wasn't enough.",

AC3 could be best summed up as: Nothing new, worse story, and AMERICA! There was a small boating simulator in AC3 that didn't go far, but all the crafting, assassin side stuff, and everything else was garbage. Thankfully, it seems like AC IV fixes all those issues.  For of all, they brought back the climb to the top and sync, rather than moving underground for fast travel points or running around on the map to discover it. You climb up, you sync, you get a fast travel and the map. This is good. They also brought back crafting, BUT it actually is useful and helps the character. All the weapons are purchased for large sums, you know, MONEY! Something that AC3 thought having lots of meant the player is having fun! Not really. It wasn't until the very end that I started to have no more use for money.  Sailing and being a pirate is really fun. Really, really fun. So much that you'll ignore the main story missions UNTIL you have to do them to unlock certain abilities.  Story wise it's a good game. The main character has faults and is somewhat likeable, unlike that jackass from AC3 who was less warm than a bag of ice. The non-assassin characters are based on historical people and are fun. But the assassin stuff is... lukewarm. In fact, you could probably strip everything Assassin's Creed out of this game and it'd be fine. And that brings me to the next subject matter: The present day.  Ubisoft should strip ALL modern day stuff and conspiracy BS in the present day from their Assassin's Creed games. Seriously. Not only did I find that part of the story to be boring, it was VERY, VERY forced. The game was trying to tell a story that nobody wanted to hear. Go back to the pirates! That's what is good!  The present day is bizarre.. you're an employee playing the memories of Desmond Miles (The most boring character in history. Thank god he was killed off.) I'm calling this right now: In AC 5 or whatever the future games will be, you'll play as this silent character in the real world until... YOU BECOME AN ASSASSIN! Create your own character that's you and ASSASSINATE DA ENEMIES! I'm calling this now and, if I am right, I want Ubisoft to personally thank me for being awesome.",

Which as I couldn't wait to get back into the animus and shoot some more ships after hacking into a thing because reasons. The audio logs and videos you get from hacking (Along with emails, poasters, ect. which I didn't read) are nice little bits about the characters that develop them more and make them seem more like a person.

You can probably finish the story in less than 8 hours so do yourself a favour and spend some time on the side missions too.  - There are a million ways to obtain money but nothing to spend it on. You can buy the best weapon in game during the first chapter. Upgrading your ship costs a lot but there's no need to upgrade your ship if you just play the story.  - Fighting is too easy: you don't really have to sneak around because you can easily kill any number of emenies in combat even with the starting weapons.  - Poor character customization options just like in the previous titles.  - Side activities get boring really fast. It can take over 100 hours to complete everything the game has to offer but in the long run it's not very fun to wander around for no reason collecting pointless animus fragments and chests full of money you don't need.  - Some VSync issues. The game tends to lock to 30FPS while using VSync in GPU intensive areas. You can solve the problem in Windows 7 by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del and then alt-tabbing back to the game. That way your FPS won't lock to 30 and there's still no screen tearing.  + Overall it's a great game but it won't keep you entertained for very long. I totally recommend it.",

It also doesn't hurt that it looks absolutely beautiful. This is my new favorite game in the series (replacing Brotherhood) and definitely worth your time, whether you're a newcomer to the franchise or a longtime fan. It should be interesting to see where Ubisoft goes from here. Whatever comes next has big shoes to fill.

I mean, seriously? The only decent activity of this type are the templar hunt missions, since they feel somewhat diverse, don't contain optional objectives (for the love of god, don't ever waste your time chasing them), and actually provide a meaningful reward. The naval combat is extremely simplified, and as soon as you start upgrading your ship, the difficulty falls below the sea level. Yet, the sailing part is still rather atmospheric and enjoyable for what it is - a distraction from frustrating AC gameplay and a fun jukebox with sea shanties. So, why am I recommending this game, you might ask? Pirate setting, especially one with naval gameplay, is a rarity nowadays.

That problem with the ♥♥♥ creed games aside (killing the mood with these interruptions), this game is great. As long as you get to be a pirate!",

Now they built a whole game around that and improved upon it in every way. i love how they thought outside the box on this one. Many users will say the frame rates ♥♥♥♥... and that’s true if you want to play in 60fps and use (built in) vsync. if you have an NVidia card (that can handle the game, i run a 780 dcIIoc'ed edition) ad you use NVidia’s built in vsync and triple buffering and set the quality (in NVidia) to high quality frame rate is 98% tear free. The game is gorgeous seriously gorgeous....  When ACBF is a pirate game it’s flawless and amazing, when it’s an AC game is good. Story is very good (for an AC game) and keeps you wanting to play even the boring parts. The modern day aspects (though limited) still suck and take you out of the game. Upgrading the Jackdaw by taking down other boats to gain materials is a nice touch. Hunting both at land and sea is present. The whale and shark hunting is great. Land hunting well it’s no hunting simply run up to and kill then animals, some (like deer) need to be stalked or you need to be in a tree, but is used to gather materials for upgrades to your character. There are a lot of things to do in this game. i have already mentioned the hunting, but there is also diving bell missions and hot spots, treasure hunting (yes with maps!, i know sweet right) sea shanties’ to find and chase after, that yours mates will sing to you when you travel (most are even pretty good), and other collectables, assassination contracts to take you all over the map and 4 legendary ships that will test your skills. I’m sure i left some things out but trust me i have over 30hours in and only ¾ of the way though the game as I keep getting side tract doing all the cool extra things this game has to offer.  My opinion 8/10 with is a buy for those that are considering ",

Honestly like many other point out is that this should have just been a pure pirate game instead of sticking the Assassin's Creed logo on it. Its the same consept in story and mostly gameplay except for two major things. In order of story is Desmond, he was a character i was somewhat invested in since i started at the first Creed and now he is gone pointing to that they are dragging the Creed series unto a more fun History lesson witch i can support but still cringe a bit over. Gameplay is somewhat the same with maybe one more toy, even so you like me are probably gonna stick to pure swordfighting and such. Except from the naval gameplay witch is quite fun to the certain degree it become as repetetive as the normal combat. That saying, does not mean it is not fun. Hell the game is a barrel of laugh sometimes because this series has found what works and whats the point of fixing something that isn't broken.  The world is gourgeous and the waters are beautiful filled with lots of content for you to drown yourself in.   This game is one i recomend even though you only care for the gameplay or the story.

Another thing to note is that the story is mostly not about Assassins more about Edward and his adventure to fortune. (this means more pirating, more for the gold instead of for the guild)  There is also and seemingly endless world and there is always something to do. From stabbing people the old fashion way (from rooftops) too whaling. This is really a fresh start for the series and one of the better parts too.  Concerning Edwards personality, It is (in my opinion) the best character in the game, he is fun and charismatic (the opposite of Conner the main char of AC3). It is also a very interesting thing to see Edward go from Pirate too Assassin.  Until about the 3/4th part in the game Edward would work for the Templars for the right price. (What gives Edward a more ''all for the gold'' instead of an Assassin kind of character).  Of course the city that we used too upgrade is now replaced with, Edwards ship the Jackdaw And the Assassins we used to send on mission is replaced with Edwards fleet, Sending the fleet on missions will unlock new ''trading routes'' and those have to be protected too.    Overall in my opinion this game deserves a 8,7/10     ",

I never played AC3, so I don't know how naval combat has changed, but it is very enjoyable. Plus you can pimp your ship.  Did I mention the game is drop-dead gorgeous. It has some of the best water effects when you're sailing on the sea. Battling with three ships while a tropical storm rages on is quite the experience. If there is anything negative I should say about the game is that the combat is still easy. It has been made more diverse with the musketmen and bigger brutes that can't be countered, but you still don't have to run very often. Oh yeah, you still have to tail a bunch of people, which is the least enjoyable part of the game. Luckily you can tag your targets with your eagle eye and see them through wall, so the tailing is maybe a tad less annoying than in the previous titles, but still feels somewhat of a bore and a way for them to not really make decent cutscenes since 'hey what if everyone just talks while they walk?'  Despite those small flaws I must recommend this game to all who've liked at least AC2. Black Flag is so very very addicting and offers some of the best sailing/privateering and exploration experiences as of late.",

If you always wanted to climb around your own ship, jumping on to a boat, and fighting whomever is on it while making money and exploring a vast open world, then you should try this game out, even if you never played Assassin's Creed games before.

        {
            "review_text": "Black Flag is probably the closest thing we've gotten to a triple-A pirate simulator.  Anyone who's played an Assassin's Creed game will note that Black Flag is much different than the others. Where previous iterations of the game where about joining or becoming an Assassin, Edward Kenway is through and through a pirate; yes, the Assassins are there as support, but Edward is a character who just uses their gadgets to further his own ends. This is a nice twist from the usual formula, and makes the game feel different compared to other entries where the Assassins are the main focus.  Yet Black Flag is also extremely welcoming to newcomers, and it is not required to play previous iterations of the game to understand the situation of the current character. If a player were to pick up Assassin's Creed for the first time, either Assassin's Creed II or IV would both be great starting points, as both games were executed very well and do not require any other game to understand.  Back to Black Flag, the game's highlight is its emphasis on naval combat. Sailing the seas is a pleasure, with large waves changing the elevation of the ships; it even changes combat, as it allows ships to fight at different elevations from each other. Storms are intimidating and exciting, with rogue waves and waterspouts threatening to capsize the ships in its path; fights can be won by simply avoiding the hazards presented. Actually fighting other ships feels tactical - ships are slow, lumbering creatures, and their positions relative to each other determines how good a shot one can pull off, and different upgrades will determine whether yours is a ship that prefers long range barrages or ramming into enemies.  As to be expected, you also have the ability to board ships. I wish I could find a game I could compare it to, but I do not have one; AC IV does it with a unique flare. The standard way to take over a ship is to simply board it with your crew and take enough lives that the rest of the ship surrenders, but this can be done in a number of ways. For instance, before the ships get close enough, one can use a swivel cannon to thin the numbers from range. As well, one does not simply have to jump on the enemy ship; ropes are available that can allow one to swing onto the enemy ship, potentially with an air borne strike involved. There are also plenty of ways to access the mast of both your own ship and that of the enemy (including jumping between the two), adding a vertical element to the assault using the game's free-run system; from this position, players get a view of the battle and can knock out enemy snipers, snipe barrels of gunpowder down below, or jump onto enemies for an air borne assassination.  As a departure from the rest of the series, Black Flag emphasizes social stealth (IE hidding in a crowd) less than other iterations of Assassin's Creed. Where Ezio from AC II blended in with the population to avoid being recognized by the guards, Black Flag seems to prefer to give the character bushes and trees to hide in. This is not wrong in and of itself, but social stealth has always been a highlight of the series, and while it is definitely present (especially for certain side missions), it does not present itself all that much in the main quest. If there's one criticism to be had here, is that enemies seem a bit deaf and dumb - they can't hear Edward most of the time (only gunshots and loud assassination techniques like air strikes or tackles), they are easy to trick into coming into assassination range, and very few enemies have a sight range that actually matters.  The game's difficulty is self-imposed; the experience changes based on how a player accomplishes their objective. Stealth without added tools is the most difficult, requiring players to be smart and calculating in order not to be spotted. Yet most of the game's content can be cleared fairly easily with a up-front combat approach, which allows one to mow down dozens of enemies easily. Arobatics are also possible, allowing one to soar up and around enemies for a mid-level difficulty when combined with stealth. However, having combat being so easy is arguably a downside; after all, why call it a stealth game when brute force works better to carefully planned and patient stealth assaults? This has always been a bit of a flaw in the AC series, but it is perhaps most prevalent in Black Flag.  The game is also full of fridge logic moments - little quirks that hit you when you're thinking about them after you're done playing. Logical misteps done for the sake of improved gameplay I can understand, but you will find a few moments in the series where something just doesn't make sense, like why the Courier you have to tackle shouts 'It's Captain Kenway! Run!' before Edward ever becomes a Captain.  Speaking of side activities, that's another strength of the game. Black Flag is the kind of game where a player almost does not want to ever use the fast travel system because of the sheer amount of fun and interesting side activities. The sea boasts ships to pirate, whales to harpoon, treasure to dive for, islands with loot, and all other sorts of optional activities that could be missed with fast travel. As for the land, there are a plethora of things to collect, including 'shanties' which allow your crew to sing different sea shanties popular during the 18th century while sailing. There are side missions involving the assassins as well, each with their own little story to them and a final reward if you can finish them. There are also a few sets of extra-difficult activities too, including the hunt for Legendary Ships; if you thought the game was getting too easy, just try to hunt one of these beasts down. The game has copious amounts of side content and hidden areas that are not only plentiful but actually fun; players can get absolutely lost in these side objectives for hours, making this a very powerful strength of the game.  Like other triple-A games these days however, you will have to get used to the UI doing a bit of hand holding, constantly reminding you what you can and can't do. A minor quirk, but annoying.  And there you have it. Would I recommend Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag? Yes; I'd recommend it to someone who's played others before, and I'd recommend it to those who have never played an AC game. AC IV is a fantastic game, and it sets a standard for what naval battles should look like in other games as well. It is expansive, detailed, beautiful and imaginative through and through. While it could have done some things to make it truly excellent, it is still an experience that shouldn't be passed over.",

I played the first 2 AC after the second while I liked the more open world feel, that's all I remembered from it, and I haven't purchased another till now. Reason being is all well and good different time periods in human history but same kind of broadcast and low skill level game. Though much effort has been in my opinion to make the lanscapes and people feel of that time period. And then there is the reality (virtual) story line that initially was a good hook, just ended up disappointing.  This game like those that followed fell low on my radar, I did enjoy to a point the first 2 I played as I have said, I saw yet another AC or added content and sighed. But then...I saw a mention of playing a pirate and also seas battles...so I looked a bit further but still I have gone through my phases as a younger man of buying on impulse and then later regretting, so I waitied abit.  I looked to players that actually played saw some footage, and well I got the impulse to buy, who doesn't want to play a pirate. The game bl;ends so well with the theme it maybe should of always been a pirate theme. The battles at sea while still arcadish are very enjoyable. The sea and lands feel alive with possibilties, lets go plunder. I like a game that pays attention to detail and offers scope for playing in with freedom, with obvious story moving and advancing the character motives, but not hindering.  This game delivers, there are some things I would like different, wind, sails and speed of ships, but overall I am so glad they implemented this and did a 8.5/10 job on it. You can see Far Cry 3 infulence in this game, as the company homes in on what actually players enjoy and adding more challenge, I would like them to make combat more a kin to Dark Souls but overall this for me is very enjoyable experience.

I feel like they really listened to the criticism of the previous two games, particularly AC3, which I spent 30 hours in and had much less fun with than I have with this one so far! This is the best AC experience I've had since AC2, and I feel like it might even turn out to be the best of the series full stop.  The pirate setting is wonderful. The gameplay so far really takes me back to the endless hours of fun I used to have with Sid Meier's Pirates! I can definitely see myself losing a ton of hours to simply sailing around the sea, boarding other ships, building up booty and exploring islands.  One thing that I really love so far is that the game is infused with a wonderfully self-effacing humour. Suddenly we're playing from the perspective of an Abstergo employee, and Ubisoft makes itself the butt of jokes constantly. If you read the historical notes on buildings, there are really funny notes and comments added in from Abstergo employees, joking about how the consumer won't notice historical inaccuracies etc. The humour goes further than that; I laughed when one of my optional challenges was to 'air assassinate an ocelot'. There are a lot of nice little details so far that have really made the world of Black Flag a pleasure to explore.  The optional challenges relating to storyline missions are now actually doable without replaying them 10 times. I simply gave up on trying to get 100% synch on AC3 because it felt like a chore and the requirements were often counter-intuitive. Here, the optional challenges always make sense.  For the first time in the AC series, the menu system finally feels like it was actually designed for a PC instead of lazily ported from a console, so if like me you prefer a mouse and keyboard, you no longer feel like you are disabled.  I will almost certainly update this review once I've put in a bunch more hours, but from what I've seen so far I have to say Ubisoft has really done something great here!",

            "review_text": "Now that I have reached about 70% total synchronization, I feel that I'm ready to review this.  Now let's start with what 'Black Flag' does right and not-so-right: -Naval combat is very simple, yet very fun -Melee combat is also simple and pretty much unchanged from previous AC installations. Is that good that's for you to decide. -Plundering ships is fun at start, but when you have to do it for the Nth time it can get a bit boring -Ship upgrading doesn't require tons of tedious grinding as the more upgraded your ship gets the more powerful ships you can tackle, and acquire more resources! -The four legendary ship fights (each at the respective corner of the map) are fun and different from each other, and provide a reason to upgrade your ship, as they are very powerful and require a well suited ship -Lack of ways to customize your ship, the only thing you can change are sails, the steering wheel, and a decorative figurehead at the front of the ship! -Now, I liked Edward as a main character and how he grows in wisdom during the progress of the game, starting as a drunken pirate, and ending as a full fledged assassin and a    father   , yet I can feel that they wanted to create another Ezio. They have tried to recreate the charm of the beloved Italian heartbreaker, yet not understanding that Ezio had three games to build his character but Edward only has one. -The plot was pretty good, I liked it, maybe it's not the strongest plot in AC history, but it's still enjoyable. Takes about 35 or more hrs to complete depending if you're going for 100% sync -The game has waaaaaaay too many trailing and eavesdropping missions, so much that it actually gets tedious on the final parts of the game -The outfits I feel are very similar and I found myself using only a few of them -Getting 100% synchronization, Is absolutely boring and useful only if you're a completionist. There is just too many chests and animus fragments, that give absolutelly minuscule rewards that there's just no motivation for me to find them! -Kenway's fleet is pretty much useless, and I rarely checked it and sent out ships to missions. -Freerunning is fluid and fast as in every AC game, yet there's also the same problems: Edward jumping where you don't want him to jump, and not climbing a ledge/tree gap that is 100% climbable. But despite those problems the freerunning compared to AC 1 is very refined, and is continually being refind with every new AC title -The game looks good and runs well too, haven't run into crashes or serious FPS drops. -Uplay gave me absolutelly no problems and works fine, kind of a useless program tho. -No useful ways where to put your money, yes, you can buy decors and renovate your stupid house, but I pretty much had forgotten about the place, and It is pretty useless. -As in every AC game you can meet a lot of historical personalities such as Cpt. Blackbeard or Hornigold -They still have a modern day subplot that kinda continues the Desmond's story ( but not really), I personally don't care about the present day, they could have just dropped the whole modern day stuff -At anytime you can leave the animus and explore Abstergo building and hack stuff to get info about all kinds of stuff, so that's kinda neat, I guess, but as I said I don't care about the present. -I have never liked the whole precursor race thing, couldn't they just made them to be simple aliens or something, would be more believable, but that's just me. -Doesn't really feel like an AC game tho, because for the most part of the game you're just a pirate who stole an assassin's robes and doesn't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about Templar/Assassin war, you just want to get that cash   Now, I have always liked AC, yes, it's an annual (well not anymore however) franchise, but I love the freerunning and seeing different time periods and places. Some people say it's getting too boring but I still love the games. And in TL;DR I can say that ACIV:Black Flag Is a great game that feels like a game with AC mechanics set in AC world but really isn't an AC game, but will still be enjoyable If you're an AC fan or a newcomer to the series! Plus if you can get it on sale like I did (5 or 7 euros) your getting your money's worth!",

The multitude of ways to deal with situations and enemies is quite refreshing from the monotony of AC3, as there are dozens (or more) ways to kill an enemy or get to your objective. A HUGE aspect to the game is the much-improved open sea gameplay and combat. It is quite easy to get caught up in and distracted by upgrading your ship, plundering resources from ships, taking down the legendaries, capturing all the garrisons, etc. This game is the breath of fresh air the franchise needed after the far-from-stellar previous game. I would even venture to say that this didn't really feel like an Assassin's Creed game at all! It just felt like an awesome pirate game that was kind of similar to Assassin's Creed except for a few plot points here and there. It would still be just as wonderful of a game if there weren't any future-y Abstergo or Animus or Minerva/Juno (or whoever those women are) elements in it and it was completely it's own stand-alone pirate game!

With your ship, the Jackdaw, you'll have to fight one Man o' War after another, plunder poor Spanish fishing boats, and travel from the north Caribbean all the way through to the south.   This time around you get to experience the endevours of Edward Kenway, a man who dreams of money, ladies, and freedom. Or should I say WENCHES, GOLD, AND RUM. Yarr. Something. Pirates. Aye.",

            "review_text": "By far my favourite game of 2013 and easily the best Assassin's Creed game yet. There was always something 'not fun' about them. Presentation and story was always top notch, but far too many irritations crept in for my liking. Black Flag changed all that and presents a world that is beautiful and fun to traverse. It's games like this that spur on the gaming industry to create more graphically real worlds and for us to upgrade our PC's to play in them on ultra settings. The water simulation is simply incredible, from calm ocean to raging storms and everything in between, underwater realms and caves..the gfx are jaw dropping. It seems no expense has been spared to create it, with every facet made to immerse the player in the pirate world. Weather and rain effects complete the simulation and kudos to the developers for not constantly reminding the player that it's 'just a simulation' by dragging you out of the gorgeous world into reality at every opportunity. We get that when we turn the game off thanks.   The direction, acting and story are of course brilliantly done, though with so many side activities to pursue whilest playing through it, my attention wasn't so much on the story, but more on completion of areas and adventuring, thus the story was difficult to follow at times.   My only complaints would be the, what seemed like 20 or 30 odd 'follow' missions and timed ones that went against the freedom the game doles out so well. One particular one wants the player to stick to the script so much i thought i was playing Call of Duty - but i don't normally do COD missions over and over like this trying to figure out how the game wants me to play. These are small things though and their frustrations are heavily outweighed by the sheer fun and addictive qualities the game contains with it's parkour and combat mechanics, not to mention naval combat, which can be fun, if the outcomes weren't so repetitive.   For the next game..i want the same, but a more interesting mission and story structure that utilises more locations on the map, NO follow missions, a far better stealth mechanic that doesn't require waiting waiting waiting and finding bushes and stalks to 'hide' in..a crouch option would have been great.  Not interested in multiplayer, though it was fun for an hour. ",

The content that you get in this game is varied, well paced and engaging.

The multiplayer hasn't really changed much, polished a bit more, yes but the multiplayer isn't why you should purchase this game. The single player is worth the full price asked for, the deluxe edition adds a couple more islands to explore and some new weapons, armor and general customization but nothing special.

The negitive: I have encountered many game breaking bugs thus far, but I believe  that they are only on my system setup. Some of them include a bug where everything suddenly turns to triangles and the game is totally unplayable. Another bug is when the games map turns into a kaleidoscope and I am unable to play the game. Other than those the game seems pretty stable. As for the gameplay, I'm not a big fan of the way the camera gets in the  way of the combat, but that is merely a minor problem.  Overall I can't recommend this game enough",

I've been a huge AC fan from the beginning, and while graphically and musically beautiful, I found myself disappointed in the story compared to the great stories in AC2 and Brotherhood. This game's main focus is on naval combat and sailing, which is a nice break from the gameplay of the past installments, and it becomes quite the (enjoyable) grind to get your ship upgraded. Main story missions suffered the most in this game, as 90% of your objectives are Eavesdropping and Tailing, with a small chance you'll actually kill your target. 90% of the optional objectives are Avoiding Combat or killing your target in a specific way (no surprise there, though).  I really fell in love with the story of this series after AC2 (as the original AC left me a little confused and curious). This game left me feeling the same as I did at the end of the original AC. I'm not sure what the point was of a lot of what I did, what degree the characters really mattered, and whether or not my actions in this game will make sense in the next. The continuity of the Ezio storyline was absolutely brilliant in my opinion, and I think I may be one of the rare people that genuinely liked the story in AC3 as well. My hope is that my utter confusion at the end of this game is because this installment will be a launching platform for an entirely new, immersive story (as the original AC was).  This game is certainly a change of pace from previous installments, and while I had many 'This is awesome!' moments, I had just as many 'Meh' moments. It's odd going from Assassin's Creed that's heavy on the 'assassin' aspect to an Assassin's Creed that focuses less on being an assassin and more on being a ship captain. It could just be the purist in me, but ship battles and beautiful graphics really weren't enough to sell me on the (what seemed to be) thrown-together-in-less-time-than-it-should-have-been storyline and character development.  All this being said, I still highly recommend the game. It, like all other installments is worth a play. The multiplayer is still just as fun as the previous installments, and this game has ample amounts of side activities to focus on when you're not in the mood to continue with any missions. The game really is beautiful, and if you've ever wanted to feel like a feared pirate sailing a bada** ship, then you will definitely like this game. I've played many games where I've been mad about an ending, only to realize later how great of a game it was regardless. This will probably be another one of those games. Prepare for some possible frustration, but give the game a go. It's worth it.",

I have a problem.  I thought to myself, 'I haven't thrown enough money into the franchise, let's get another one!', so I purchased Black Flag. BOOM! The love of AC was ignited, to the extent that I am now going through all the other games, as I have a newfound love and appreciation for the Assassins and the wonderful story woven within.  Black Flag has a very smooth play mechanic, combining close combat with the wild, open seas of the Caribbean. As if it wasn't awesome enough to be a badass assassin, you now have you VERY. OWN. PIRATE. SHIP. One that you control, customize, and send to a watery grave after a quick row with the Legendary Vessels in the area.

The primary reason I say this is that it's essentially the old Sid Meier's Pirates game (which I very much enjoyed), except done up with Assassin's Creed's plot and better graphics, as well as much more entertaining ship and boarding combat. On a macro scale it's similar as well; you cruise around the Caribbean at your own free will depending on which way the wind is blowing, and are free to visit towns and cities to repair, rearm and upgrade your ship (and your character - Edward Kenway), you can raid and capture European forts which provide mercenary contracts, insiders whom you may pay off to lower your bounty from either Britain or Spain, and a shipwright, who again can repair, rearm and upgrade your ship - the Jackdaw. The one thing which in my opinion is the heart of the game is the fact that you can simply sail around fighting, boarding and capturing European schooners, galleons, frigates and man'o'wars, all of which have lucrative rewards for those in need of cash. This is highly entertaining and I haven't found myself getting board of this particular mechanic once yet.  I will also add that the creators at Ubisoft have not optimised this game for PC, and in fact stated they simply didn't care to do so for this title. As such, expect it to run quite a bit worse than Assassin's Creed III, even if you played both on the medium graphical preset. All-in-all, and considering it took Ubisoft a rushed year to get this game out (as they will be doing from now on with all subsequent games in the franchise), I'd recommend anyone to buy this game, even if you're not previously a fan of the A.C. series.",

Favorite parts have to be sea shanties and firing mortars at enemy ships. Your ship, the Jackdaw, can be fully customized and you'll spend a large part of this game collecting large sums of money to upgrade her.   The weather system is pretty awe inspiring. The skies will go dark and the dynamic ocean will grow at random, throwing rouge waves at your ship.

            "review_text": "First things first, the opening paragraph isn't true. You're not trained by Assassin's, you just happen to have all the skills already! You're not part of the Creed for the most part [won't spoil it too much, but the opening sequences a real heart-breaker - for me at least].  The only AC game I haven't played is AC1. I started on AC2, and everyone I spoke to said to not waste my time with AC1 as it was quite boring, and the controls and game-play were pretty much the same for AC2. I have read the synopsis and played every other major AC since, and aside from Black Flag, Revelations is by far my favourite. The location, the catacomb searches, the controls, the armour, the graphics, sound, and of course Ezio's enigmatic charisma; everything was spot on for me [At first, I didn't like the AC3/4 controls, but I've grown to like them]. Also ACR filled in a lot of the holes that even AC1 didn't fill in, so there's that too. I also have Turkish heritage, so learning about it's history was very interesting to me [on that note, I've actually learnt more about world history from the AC games than I ever did in school]. On top of these, like AC3, they've completely removed the bomb crafting mechanics, which added a extra aspect of gameplay to Revelations, along with making the enemy models a bit more mainstream, and having only 5 major enemy classes [I remember having a few other specialist classes in Revelations]. Which also detracts from gameplay, as before there were certain enemies you HAD to dodge, ones you HAD to stun, and the rest you could either wittle them down or easily counter. I prefered this, even though you really had to take note of their individual costumes/weapons, it helped keep the gameplay variety up.  With this iteration though, I have noticed more small bugs too, which is par for the course with AC, but the parkour seems a bit... stickier than before - I think that's because they've removed the 3-tier free-running [where W+Shift+Right-Click would get you free-running before, now it's just Shift+W - making it easier to overshoot your mark]. There's also a weird draw issue where the world maybe loaded, but certain objects and NPC's won't be. I've turned corners to be greeted by an empty street, and a second later people and certain objects will materialise out of thin air. Setting the world detail to very high fixes this, but I'm getting frame drops as a result [I know this is partly my rig, but still!]  In saying all these things, this is still a mind-blowingly good game. Only other game I played since picking it up was Dota2 and that was a single match for a tournament. They really knew what they were going for when they brought the naval portion into the forefront and you will end up spending majority of your time on the open sea.  I'm yet to play the multiplayer, but if it's anything like ACR's [which I absolutely adored - purely for it's Simple Deathmatch mode], then I'm going to love it. *UPDATE* I've since played the Multiplayer, and they've removed the Simple Deathmatch mode. It's much the same as ACR's aside from this though.  The 'real-world' of this, like all other previous AC's is nothing special, but now they've made you a faceless drone, bringing it into first-person view, and even more dull than before. There are some familiar faces though, so that's comforting at least. You're essentially a game-tester in this. In this sense, Ubisoft is putting it out there that they're like Abstergo Entertainment, which just doesn't sit right with me, as much as I love their 3 major franchises [AC, Far Cry and Tom Clancy's]. If you have a poke around on the 'outside' you'll notice some small cross-game Easter eggs, with 'ctOS' from Watch Dogs, but since playing Watch Dogs, there's nothing tying the 2 together. Maybe they'll bring the two together in later games? I mean, they *are* bring the 2 timelines closer together. Slowly but surely.  All in all, I highly recommend this game. If you enjoyed the naval portions of AC3, you'll love them here, although they do mean less 'Assassin' type gameplay. The locations, scenery, hunting and of course all the regular AC gameplay, tied in with the naval aspects make this one hell of game. To me, second only to Revelations.",

            "review_text": "What can I say to compliment this game in a way that won't be self-evident when you play? This is one of the most beautiful, enjoyable games I've ever seen. Even down to the open sea hunting. I've had the dubious pleasure of swimming with hammerhead sharks IRL, and the designers captured the way they move and swim so realistically, I felt a moment of adrenaline while trying to harpoon one. It moved just like ones in real life. So awesome. Everything is wonderful this way -- the oceans, the combat, the scenery.   I've heard people complain about it lacking the kind of purity of game-play of previous AC instalments, due to the piracy subject matter and the ship-to-ship combat. Those kinds of concerns are plainly laughable; this is classic AC 'plus'. Nothing you appreciated from earlier versions is missing. On the contrary, the diversity of environments only enhances what might have become repetitive about previous versions. The combat style of the assassin's seem so much more brilliant having to use vehicles and machinery. The same old 'find area, climb building, drop down and kill' is dramatically reduced. I can't just walk around holding the counter, waiting to hit the 'I win button' in every fight. Some enemies are too hard to counter, and you have to break their defences while being attacked from all sides. I have to be aware of the battlefield, and make use of my shipmates in combat. I can win by boarding the enemy ship and jumping into the fray, or by sneaking across the rigging of my own ship, or by just sniping objectives from my own rigging.   While some things were a bit cheese, like enemy scouts one shotting you down to the deck when you use a lift to reach their platforms, the glitches seemed to cut both ways. In fact, some missions or objectives seemed almost to rely on them as if the dev's wanted you to glitch your way to victory. For example, if you disable a ship, then swim over to it instead of boarding it normally, you can kill the crew without having to fight endlessly spawning enemies. Even the scout snipers behaviour is less aggressive this way, and you can use a lift to reach them and get behind the back kills. Doing it normally, their aggro behaviour would be far more aggressive. All things considered, if you want to sacrifice the extra time to do it this way, it almost seems like a fair trade off. Some Man 'o Wars can be found moored with their rigging up, and can be taken solo long before the Jackdaw is capable of capturing them in battle.  Choices are the spice of life -- coming up with my own way to achieve victory is thrilling! Thank you, Ubisoft, for having enough respect for my intelligence to let me find my own way to win. You have no idea how refreshing that is these days.  Definitely take your time to enjoy this game the proper way. Don't race through the main storyline. Try to finish all the side missions, go after all the special outfits and armour sets, the pistol rewards from the naval missions, etc., then worry about completing the storyline.   The very best missions, hands down, were the one's that involved elaborate, nail-biting chases. Like Sequence 6, Memory 3 -- if they could make a whole game like that particular memory I'd die of joy. Often, side missions were far more entertaining than main missions, like Templar Hunt 4 mission 3 where you escort a drunk. So hilarious.  Not wanting to sound the gushing fanboy, I do have criticisms. I really appreciated the challenge of the legendary ship battles (even Impoluto, that likes to defy physics and jump out of the water just to teach you your place, petty inferior human AI), but mourned the fact that I have no legendary ships left to use the ram charge ability on. After all the legendary ships are dead, and you can one-shot most man-o-wars with the reward, the ship combat is over. There's nothing to go after at that point, nothing worth upgrading the Jackdaw for unless you feel OCD.  I suppose I do have a complaint in that respect: the best weapons and armour were by no means overpowered enough to have them become available so late in the game. The rope darts for example, why couldn't we enjoy that until the very final sequences of the main storyline? What a shame to have played nearly the entire game, and then get this ability or item, only to have nothing left to use it on. Maybe the devs assumed I would use it to go do the side missions with after the main was done, but what point is there in doing those if the reward of the side missions is the best gear you only have an incentive to acquire to do the main missions with?  You can gather more than enough money and resources to fully upgrade the ship before the final sequences, but get told 'prerequisite - this upgrade is available later in the main storyline'. I assume this artificial block on abilities is meant to prevent me from becoming so OP that there is no challenge in the later missions. I imagine balancing gear with a challenging main storyline is difficult, and I don't want to complain too much. I will limit my complaint to saying that I actually found grinding to improve my ship enjoyable; I anticipated not liking it so much, but being a pirate is really fun. I just wish their was more chance to choose moving ahead in the game by piracy, rather than being told go 'do more ninja now'.  Why not write missions where I use piracy to get information, instead of tailing people with cheesy arbitrary ways to fail? I'd rather attack a fort or take down a really hard convoy to get the info the storyline wants me to have.  If I had to limit myself to one major complaint, it would have to be the excessive reliance on 'tail this guy' or 'eavesdrop on this conversation' style missions. These get obnoxious fast, especially when you realize how limited you are in creatively solving these challenges. It puts drag on the composition of the characters and story too, because it feels like everything is being shoe-horned into a stealth mission 'just because'. It felt like Deus ex Machina sometimes, being told I will get full synchronization for assassinating the diplomat from a haystack, but the only haystack on his path is in a restricted area between four guards. Somehow, they just magically don't notice this not-so-stealth slaughter, but catch whiff of me from a football field away if I try anything else. We just jump to a cutscene, and magically I'm standing at the gate of a party. Didn't have to kill the guy for his clothes then successfully escape. It feels unnatural for a game so focused on combat and stealth, to just shuffle me along a storyline and rewarding me for not fighting or for only being stealthy to a point then abandoning that emphasis. Even punishing me for these things.  If the point here is to minimize combat, or make players think outside the box, running fights are definitely the better way to go than boilerplate 'tail someone without being noticed' drudgery. There's just as much reliance on timing and spacial awareness during a fighting chase as during a 'tail someone without being seen', and feels more believable. Its more fun being able to recover from being detected than it is to have to wait through loading screens because I didn't use some boring sniper trick or environment exploit to kill or tail a guy without been noticed.  Introduce stealth, brute force, piracy as options, but leave it to the player to decide which way to skin the cat imho. Overall 9/10. Buy this game. You won't regret it. Cheers.",

Because of this, I was not excited about Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. I decided to try the game out when it was on sale during the holiday sale, and I regret nothing. This game is everything I wanted in an Assassin's Creed game. My problems with other games in the series tends to be that eventually, I feel like I have run out of things to do. I have yet to approach such a wall in this game. From the naval combat to the hunting, there is always more to do. Because of this, I feel like my favorite game in the Assassin's Creed franchise is now Black Flag. It is worth every penny that it costs. The only downside to this game is the Uplay interface. Anyone who has purchased other games from Ubisoft for the PC know how the games require Uplay to be launched, so it tends to be just more crap to deal with.

            "review_text": "A solid game, though repetitive. I've been a huge AC fan from the beginning, and while graphically and musically beautiful, I found myself disappointed in the story compared to the great stories in AC2 and Brotherhood. This game's main focus is on naval combat and sailing, which is a nice break from the gameplay of the past installments, and it becomes quite the (enjoyable) grind to get your ship upgraded. Main story missions suffered the most in this game, as 90% of your objectives are Eavesdropping and Tailing, with a small chance you'll actually kill your target. 90% of the optional objectives are Avoiding Combat or killing your target in a specific way (no surprise there, though).  I really fell in love with the story of this series after AC2 (as the original AC left me a little confused and curious). This game left me feeling the same as I did at the end of the original AC. I'm not sure what the point was of a lot of what I did, what degree the characters really mattered, and whether or not my actions in this game will make sense in the next. The continuity of the Ezio storyline was absolutely brilliant in my opinion, and I think I may be one of the rare people that genuinely liked the story in AC3 as well. My hope is that my utter confusion at the end of this game is because this installment will be a launching platform for an entirely new, immersive story (as the original AC was).  This game is certainly a change of pace from previous installments, and while I had many 'This is awesome!' moments, I had just as many 'Meh' moments. It's odd going from Assassin's Creed that's heavy on the 'assassin' aspect to an Assassin's Creed that focuses less on being an assassin and more on being a ship captain. It could just be the purist in me, but ship battles and beautiful graphics really weren't enough to sell me on the (what seemed to be) thrown-together-in-less-time-than-it-should-have-been storyline and character development.  All this being said, I still highly recommend the game. It, like all other installments is worth a play. The multiplayer is still just as fun as the previous installments, and this game has ample amounts of side activities to focus on when you're not in the mood to continue with any missions. The game really is beautiful, and if you've ever wanted to feel like a feared pirate sailing a bada** ship, then you will definitely like this game. I've played many games where I've been mad about an ending, only to realize later how great of a game it was regardless. This will probably be another one of those games. Prepare for some possible frustration, but give the game a go. It's worth it.",

I was originally worried that the strong focus on ships would be the downfall of this offering in the series, however i find my self getting lost in scouring the oceans for battles completely forgetting the main story line. The storyline itself is entertaining, but personally not as strong as say assassins creed and assassins creed 2, but it does well to drive you forward to find out what happens. I can see myself playing this game for quite some time, the introduction of Initiates promises to offer endless replay value. All in all this is a fantastic game, if you like the series you will definately like this game.  As a side note i love what Ubisoft are doing in ways of integrating the mobile platform into the actual game rather than it just being some crappy mobile game offering. Being able to view the map in real time on my phone as well as treasure maps and perform kenway's fleet actions enhances the experience greatly.",

I got it two days ago on Steam and I love it. It's a great game with satisfying animations and a huge open world. Gameplay- 7/10 Story- 6/10 Raging level 11/10. My complant though is the endless glitches and falling through the world a couple of times. And how they (NO SPOILERS) introduce a couple of (nameless) characters that are SUPER interesting. (Not gonna say anything about them) but characters that you want to see more of. Then they kill them. Literally like 8 different loveable interesting characters die. I'm all for a sad ending (The Last of Us, Bioshock etc.) but this game's ending with the sadness felt too much like they were trying to have it be deep and sad but failed miserablly. Other then that I liked it, but this is a rare occurense that I think a not super sad ending would have been preferable. I can say this about like 5 games EVER and this is one. Oh also, if you love this game and want to play more AC do NOT get ACU, it's a peice of ♥♥♥♥ (have a review on that game too) ACU sucks ♥♥♥, and is not worth the money. But I've heard good things about Assassins Creed Rouge so get that one if you want a good AC game after this one. Or just wait 6 months for the next one that's coming out. Takes place in Victorian Britan. Getting really sidetracked here ahhaha basically if there was a 'medium' button instead of yes or no reccomendations I would put that in. But since they're isn't, you should get this game.",

            "review_text": "An outstanding game. Fairly heavy on PC requirements but it looks good even on low settings with many features turned off. Free running is stream-lined and only requires the use of one button to run. It is also much faster and while targeting your jumps still suffers in accuracy, it works better than ever before. There are also new run animations such as moving around objects and swinging from object to object (monkey bars). In other words the free running has reached what the designers had planned for the first game. The world feels populated and unlike other Assassins Creed games it is one that you will want to explore. Cities are smaller but personally I prefer that to big maps such as Brotherhood's Rome which consisted of largly empty space and similar buildings. In other words the new cities are exciting, alive, and easier to traverse. The addition of fast travel also helps. Fast travel is not exclusive to the big map, it is also avaliable within cities. All viewpoints are now fast travel locations, which more often then not are placed relatively close to missions and side activites. Side activites are better than in past games. I have yet to encounter anything such as races, which I welcome as I often found them infuriating in past games due to the inaccuracy during free running. In fact the only side activity I have encountered so far is assassination contracts. Assassination contracts no longer have cutscenes or really add to the story in any way. Some may take issue with this but I found that it made them easier to jump into. Side activites are a bit quicker and in my opinion feel more like actual side activites, quick breaks from the main game. To make up for the lack of the old side activities there are more collectibles. There are animus scraps, chest, viewpoints, treasure maps, messages in bottles, and sea shanties. Sea shanties could be considered the new race system. When you approach one it will start to fly away and you must chase after it and catch it before it disappears, though if you position yourself right it will fly straight into you as soon as it starts moving. There is a new crafting system that requires you to hunt animals in order to make health upgrades, weapons, and pouches. While this isnt terribly exciting, it isn't bad either and adds some more gameplay. Your pirate ship now functions as your base, meaning that you can upgrade it and change its appearance. I have yet to come across any sort of money accumulation system such as in Brotherhood or AC 2 so money carries more value and decisions require more thought.There are Mayan artifacts that serve as the new hidden puzzles. I have found one so far and it was not very difficult. I liked how I was able to do it in the game though as opposed to past games where I would have to find something hidden in a painting to watch a video. This one only required that I match a shape with nearby objects. The sailing is great and the game makes you feel like a real pirate. Naval battles are fun and dangerous. Enemy ships often travel in groups, so fighting one ship often turns into fighting two or three ships. You really feel like a pirate attacking a convoy. The new combat system is a little tougher but in a good way. I found it harder to win fights than in Brotherhood where I could kill 56 enemies without being touched. Fights seem to pose more of a threat now but that may also be due to my game lagging during these. I am running this game on a basic laptop so I do suffer a small amount of frame rate drop on rare occasion. The final thing I should mention is that health is now regenerative. I have seen people complain about this but I enjoy it. I got tired of always having to run to a doctor in Brotherhood especially when my character jumping off the side of a building and hurt himself, against my best efforts to guide him to the adjacent roof. I enjoy the regerative health because I found the old system tedioius. I also feel that the more menus that I am required to jump through the less immersed I am in the game. Upon this, I am reminded to mention that I have yet to leave the animus. So far it seems that leave the animus is not a requirement at all. This feels good, unlike in past games where you were taken out right when the action was picking up and reminded that it is just a simulation. Also, regarding combat, you can no longer kill civilians unless you go into free target and shoot them. I don't know why it took this long to remove that feature, as in past games killing civilians would result in a 'game over'. As a result targeting is easier and you will take out that enemy you were aiming at instead of a civilian. I run this game on an unmodified Dell Inspiron laptop and while I have to use low settings the game still looks nice and plays well. Anyone reading this review should bear in mind that the last Assassins Creed game I played was Brotherhood on Xbox 360. So some of the improvements I have mentioned may have been made already in Assassins Creed 3. Overall AC IV is a great game 10/10, it is my favorite Assassins Creed game and I would recommend it.  P.S. If you are worried about the controls with mouse and keyboard I can tell you that they are smooth and function well. I honestly don't feel like I am suffering because I do not have a gamepad. I think that a gamepad is still (I imagine) the best way to play this game but it is equally enjoyable and easy to play without one.",

Not goofy or comedic hilarious, just it's really funny when you reflect on what's actually going on compared to the other games. Where in the other games every bit of plot only contributed more 'this is for serious must save the world' to the plot. This one is very piratey. Just...piratey. It's better not to explain it. Thus far it truly truly IS Pirate's Creed.  Modern storyline - No Desmond. The modern storyline is very barely there. it doesn't drag on and on. And it's meta hilarious. The whole thing is set in Abstergo Entertainment, which is pretty clearly a parody of UbiSoft Montreal, in a dream building where UbiSoft Montreal's employees clearly wish they really worked. The attempt to make a super high-tech game development office environment only makes it almost painfully pretentious and French, which just adds to the comedy. You only have to get out of the Animus for super short bits of time, and then go right back in.  The world is roughly 1000x better than Assassin's Creed 3's. Hell, I'd say it's probably the best world since Assassin's Creed 2 (it gets a bit apples and oranges-y to compare Renaissance Italy and the piratey Caribbean). You never ever feel bored. There's a constant avalanche of stuff to do, and I haven't even gotten far enough in the story to unlock all the things there are to do yet (I haven't gone harpooning or diving yet). The cities are much more like Florence and Venice, and free-running like a complete maniac through the city is back to being your primary mode of travel in cities. The jungles are pretty much the nicest ones I've seen in any game, and that pretty much goes for the whole rest of the world too. I can just get lost in staring at my ship sailing at full speed, and watching the blue green waves.  It seems like they rebalanced the game back where it needs to be. Took away the completely OP rapid-firing one-hit-stealth killing bow and crossbow and Brotherhood that made the game stupidly easy. It seems like they nerfed Edward back down to Assassin's Creed 2 Ezio's power levels, which is COMPLETELY a good thing. The combat seems like it's actually pretty hard and not just complete easy mode the way it was in ACR and AC3....but that could be me sucking with the M&amp;K...  The naval combat is like AC3's except pretty much better in every way. Tons of ship upgrades, floatsam to collect, shipwrecked sailors to rescue, cargo to collect and sell. Boarding actions are now a natural organic part of regular naval warfare. It's pretty glorious....and can be hard as balls if you pick the wrong fight. Pirate hunters and whole imperial fleets will just mess you up.  They got rid of all that stupid cargo caravan trading crap from AC3. Now all the animals you hunt and cargo you steal/salvage is used to craft upgrades or is sold directly. They tossed out the lame AC3 system of only unlocking new weapons and basically never upgrading anything, and went back to something a closer to the old system. You don't buy separate upgraded greaves, braces, and armor now, but you CAN upgrade your whole armor set by hunting down the animals needed to get the required materials. Unlike all assassin's before him, tailors don't just dye Edward's robes different colors, instead, every 'color' is a unique set of duds or major addition to Edward's robes. I've got a big red Spanish nobility cloak on over my robes, for example. You can also upgrade the Jackdaw (your ship) functionally and cosmetically.  Basically that's what I've seen so far, and I'm aware of numerous other aspects of the game that I haven't even unlocked yet.  The music is good again! Not quite Assassin's Creed 2's super fantastic music, but pretty great. Instead of those stupid papers you ran around catching for Ben Franklin in AC3, now you run around catching new sea shanties for your crew to sing.  The whole game is pretty awesome. It may be the first AC game to be on AC2's level. I can't be sure until I beat it though.",

It has gripping story, fun and intresting people, the combat is fast and powerful, you can hunt, kit out Edward in armor and extra pistols, give him new clothing (although this is sadly limited), change out your swords and pistol sets (again, sadly limited)...  The voice acting is well done, the ship controls well and the sea combat is fast, fun, tence and makes you feel like a real powerful pirate to be feared. The explration can get boring, but so can exploring in most games...  I beg anyone who loves Assassin's Creed, anyone who is even thinking of buying this game, that they buy it...the singleplayer is so much fun, sailing around and being a Assassin pirate is the best...",

The story itself is well written with interesting characters, emotional and engaging missions and cutscenes. The portrayal of real historical pirates in the AC universe was movielike material.  But where the game succeeds the most is in its gameplay, combining the usual AC combat with AC3 naval combat and expanding on the navigation and exploration aspect, it delivers a unique experience and innovative twist in the series. The map of the West Indies is huge and full of content to explore; you can roam through the seas, fighting epic naval battles, taking over forts, whaling and treasure hunting, and also assassin contracts from the previous games are back, along with naval ones.  You can even develop you ship into a true terror of the seas, from its appearance to its weapons. There are dozens of hours in side quests and world exploration alone, the game’s soundtrack and sea shanties really add to the immersion.  The graphics are also fantastic, from the ports to the islands, jungles or the open seas, the weather events are also well designed. However the game was not that well optimized, since it crashed several times, delivered random black screens on the Uplay start up and a few framerate issues regardless of my hardware being superior to the recommended specs.  Aside from these problems, this mix of AC gameplay and naval gameplay was a fantastic experience; it became one of my favorite gameplay styles on pc and worth every cent.",

The controls of your character when running around doing parkour can get frustrating at times when you're trying to chase something/someone down, but overall its good.  Where the game shines for me is the naval gameplay. Fighting in storms and boarding of ships is very fluid and chaotically fun at the same time.

It looks like they managed to iron out many of the problems that were in AC3. This title runs better (After some tweaking of the settings), has many more graphics options for setting up your own personal optimal performance and visual balance. They are a bit confusing compared to most graphical options thanks to Nvidia optimizing the game, but when you figure out what they all are and their impact on performance, you can quite easily set it up to run the way you want it.  A tip for other AMD users like myself, disable V sync in game, and use Radeon Pro for your V sync. Create a profile in it, set V sync to always on in the tweaks tab, set triple buffering on, and enter your monitors refresh rate in the box next to the triple buffering check box. Make sure Radeon Pro is running in the backround so the profile is applied. This lifted the annoying 30 FPS cap in cities, allowing for variable FPS up to a max of 60, and got rid of screen tearing. Ubi's V sync is the main issue with AMD cards in this title (Thanks, Nvidia). After doing this I was able to crank almost everything up to max including environment detail with a minimum of 35 smooth FPS on the busiest of streets and most dense of forests. I am using an R9 280X.  On to the gameplay. This game was genuinely fun to play. It seemed a little too easy at times, but at least it was not frusterating like AC 3 was. The sailing is awesome, and the controls were revamped from the awkward ones in AC 3. It doesn't annoy the hell out of me like AC 3 did. The fighting controls work much better as do the free running controls. Just much better all around. Upgraded weapons actually increase your effectivness in combat unlike AC 3, you can craft useful items once again, you can make money more effectively, and the list of improvements go on. The characters are also much more interesting and likable. The story is interesting and makes you actually want to complete the game, much like AC 2 through Revelations were.

Unlike other AC games, with sprawling places to explore, this one breaks things up into bite-sized islands, each with it's own secrets. Individually, these aren't very interesting, but they are tied into a greater whole and this makes them interesting to explore.  The story is compelling. I liked how the present day story is tied into the past one, and found the present day activities to be the best in the series. Very walking simulator-ish, but a good change of pace, with humor and interesting backstory.  I think this game has a really good twist in the Kenway storyline. It's not a surprise ending, but [SPOILERS] 2/3rds of the way through things go from peachy-keen to dire. The people you've befriended start dying and your character changes because of this. It's storytelling 101 (3-act play), but it is well done and compelling. It means that Kenway's saga ends not with a cheap twist, but a real resolution, which I think makes this game a complete experience, more than any other game in the series.  Good stuff.

            "review_text": "Black Flag is probably the closest thing we've gotten to a triple-A pirate simulator.  Anyone who's played an Assassin's Creed game will note that Black Flag is much different than the others. Where previous iterations of the game where about joining or becoming an Assassin, Edward Kenway is through and through a pirate; yes, the Assassins are there as support, but Edward is a character who just uses their gadgets to further his own ends. This is a nice twist from the usual formula, and makes the game feel different compared to other entries where the Assassins are the main focus.  Yet Black Flag is also extremely welcoming to newcomers, and it is not required to play previous iterations of the game to understand the situation of the current character. If a player were to pick up Assassin's Creed for the first time, either Assassin's Creed II or IV would both be great starting points, as both games were executed very well and do not require any other game to understand.  Back to Black Flag, the game's highlight is its emphasis on naval combat. Sailing the seas is a pleasure, with large waves changing the elevation of the ships; it even changes combat, as it allows ships to fight at different elevations from each other. Storms are intimidating and exciting, with rogue waves and waterspouts threatening to capsize the ships in its path; fights can be won by simply avoiding the hazards presented. Actually fighting other ships feels tactical - ships are slow, lumbering creatures, and their positions relative to each other determines how good a shot one can pull off, and different upgrades will determine whether yours is a ship that prefers long range barrages or ramming into enemies.  As to be expected, you also have the ability to board ships. I wish I could find a game I could compare it to, but I do not have one; AC IV does it with a unique flare. The standard way to take over a ship is to simply board it with your crew and take enough lives that the rest of the ship surrenders, but this can be done in a number of ways. For instance, before the ships get close enough, one can use a swivel cannon to thin the numbers from range. As well, one does not simply have to jump on the enemy ship; ropes are available that can allow one to swing onto the enemy ship, potentially with an air borne strike involved. There are also plenty of ways to access the mast of both your own ship and that of the enemy (including jumping between the two), adding a vertical element to the assault using the game's free-run system; from this position, players get a view of the battle and can knock out enemy snipers, snipe barrels of gunpowder down below, or jump onto enemies for an air borne assassination.  As a departure from the rest of the series, Black Flag emphasizes social stealth (IE hidding in a crowd) less than other iterations of Assassin's Creed. Where Ezio from AC II blended in with the population to avoid being recognized by the guards, Black Flag seems to prefer to give the character bushes and trees to hide in. This is not wrong in and of itself, but social stealth has always been a highlight of the series, and while it is definitely present (especially for certain side missions), it does not present itself all that much in the main quest. If there's one criticism to be had here, is that enemies seem a bit deaf and dumb - they can't hear Edward most of the time (only gunshots and loud assassination techniques like air strikes or tackles), they are easy to trick into coming into assassination range, and very few enemies have a sight range that actually matters.  The game's difficulty is self-imposed; the experience changes based on how a player accomplishes their objective. Stealth without added tools is the most difficult, requiring players to be smart and calculating in order not to be spotted. Yet most of the game's content can be cleared fairly easily with a up-front combat approach, which allows one to mow down dozens of enemies easily. Arobatics are also possible, allowing one to soar up and around enemies for a mid-level difficulty when combined with stealth. However, having combat being so easy is arguably a downside; after all, why call it a stealth game when brute force works better to carefully planned and patient stealth assaults? This has always been a bit of a flaw in the AC series, but it is perhaps most prevalent in Black Flag.  The game is also full of fridge logic moments - little quirks that hit you when you're thinking about them after you're done playing. Logical misteps done for the sake of improved gameplay I can understand, but you will find a few moments in the series where something just doesn't make sense, like why the Courier you have to tackle shouts 'It's Captain Kenway! Run!' before Edward ever becomes a Captain.  Speaking of side activities, that's another strength of the game. Black Flag is the kind of game where a player almost does not want to ever use the fast travel system because of the sheer amount of fun and interesting side activities. The sea boasts ships to pirate, whales to harpoon, treasure to dive for, islands with loot, and all other sorts of optional activities that could be missed with fast travel. As for the land, there are a plethora of things to collect, including 'shanties' which allow your crew to sing different sea shanties popular during the 18th century while sailing. There are side missions involving the assassins as well, each with their own little story to them and a final reward if you can finish them. There are also a few sets of extra-difficult activities too, including the hunt for Legendary Ships; if you thought the game was getting too easy, just try to hunt one of these beasts down. The game has copious amounts of side content and hidden areas that are not only plentiful but actually fun; players can get absolutely lost in these side objectives for hours, making this a very powerful strength of the game.  Like other triple-A games these days however, you will have to get used to the UI doing a bit of hand holding, constantly reminding you what you can and can't do. A minor quirk, but annoying.  And there you have it. Would I recommend Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag? Yes; I'd recommend it to someone who's played others before, and I'd recommend it to those who have never played an AC game. AC IV is a fantastic game, and it sets a standard for what naval battles should look like in other games as well. It is expansive, detailed, beautiful and imaginative through and through. While it could have done some things to make it truly excellent, it is still an experience that shouldn't be passed over.",

            "review_text": "Let me put this first, I tried really hard to love this game I clocked a ton of time on it when I was on vacation but every hour I played was a struggle to continue as of writing this I haven't finished the game and after a particular mission that just dragged on I said screw it and probably won't be going back it's just not fun anymore.  Now with that being said I have a lot of friends who love the AC series and I used to be one of them when it was still in it's infancy. But starting with Revelation it lost that spark of greatness it had. When you first had Altair and you ran up your first wall it was amazing something completely different from anything else on the market something alien to the usual open world game, here was a world fully populated with milling people beggars, children, the women and it felt alive they were more than just obstacles to run around they gave the cities you visited life.   And then you took control of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and the game changed again and for the better. The cities that were once backgrounds to the the story became the story the villains were truly imposing figures people who you could equally understand and hate for their hand in what was happening. Nothing felt ham handed everything had a purpose even the subplot missions to give you more of Ezio's life story always felt relevant and made me want to know more. I wanted nothing more than to run around the cities and find new ways of moving. Just to view some of the greatest cities in history during the height of their power. The colors the people it felt so real like you were actually there, that you could truly imagine the city acting the way it did. Yes there were some silly moments still that seemed weird but never anything so jarring to tear you out of the awe you felt while playing.   But that magic was gone for me when revelation came out. Yes it was still a good game and there were still some neat things done with it and I would still argue that it was one of the golden age AC games but it was also the weakest in my opinion. I never felt the awe I did in venice I never felt any motivation to explore like I did in Rome, I logged so much of my time in Brotherhood doing nothing more than running around the city making it mine, yet Revelation never wanted that from me. I can't even remember who the villains were for Revelation yea sure the Templars are still the over all bad guy but i can't stab an idea like I can stab a Borgia. After brotherhood the villains were all generic I never felt like my acts influenced history the way they did before there were no awe inspiring moments, like as Altair fighting in front of the King or the actual surprise I had at having to confront your mentor and unraveling that story. Moments like Ezio being awoken to his home being attacked by the Borgia's he had thought he'd defeated only to lose his uncle Mario or the final climb to find the last Borgia and ending it. After those moments I couldn't tell you one awesome moment from Revelation and AC3 I had more fun hunting animals than people. And the cities stopped feeling alive, the people stopped being anything more than an irritant like a group of flies bothering me. My weapons which for Ezio was all about the assassin's gauntlet stopped being special and felt like just another tool nothing more. With Conner or Edward more often than not I asked myself why do I even care to try to assassinate anyone when I can just charge in with my big weapon have a small group fight and feel no repercussions. Sure you could do the same with Ezio you'd argue but it actually felt like an option with equal merit to stealth. I felt like an assassin with Ezio I felt like a brawler with a chip on his shoulder with Conner and Edward.  I know people gave Desmond a lot of crap during the first few games but by revelation I loved playing as him it felt like he was actually on his way to becoming a full fledged assassin like Ezio was in times past, it actually felt like a story being told inception style which was awesome. now you're just some random schmuck with no name and no face and even less personality, and yet I still have more fun playing no name than I do actually playing the assassin of the week for whatever AC game i'm on.  The magic is gone from AC as an assassin I don't matter, you could take me out of the story and replace me with whoever and no one would care. I miss you Assassin's Creed you were once a Shining example of what breaking the mold looked like now you're just another cookie cutter game that doesn't stand out.",

Your ship Jackdaw is your home and you can sail trhough Caribbean, destroying and plundering Spanish and English fleet, exploring Kingston or Havana or many exotic islands and locations. Pirating and upgrading your ship can be pretty addictive. The part of the game in present day is again boring and useless, they should just present it as short animated sequences and let us rather play more in great historical periods.",

Graphics are amazing (better on Nvidia cards, more on that), the gameplay is fluid and well done, albeit a few issues, and the actual content of the game makes you feel immersed in the story of Captain Kenway. About the graphics: this game is obviously optimized for Nvidia cards. I use an r9 290OC Gigabyte card, FX8350 CPU and 16GB of RAM and yet I can't play on Ultra settings at 1080p without so-so framerates (18-40). It took a lot of tweaking to get it to be 60FPS but the game just doesn't seem to run all that well with my set up. Also, I have beaten the game and wanted to jump in to see what other things I can complete to get to 100% and it looks like Uplay deleted my save file. Like others have said, I truly hope Uplay goes away, I just don't see the point of using an additional game client when I buy my games through Steam, which validates games and protects against piracy anyway. Regardless of that, I would highly recommend anyone new or veteran to the series to pick this up and play!",

While people will still say that 2 or Brotherhood are the best (they are still fantastic games though), Black Flag offers a sense of scope and exploration that just hasn't been matched before or since.  The Caribbean open world that the game offers is HUGE and not only that it's dense as is tradition in any ubisoft open world game so there is tons of stuff to do. Hell being able to sail to remote islands with your ship, the Jackdaw, makes all the crazy item hunting to 100% the game more entertaining than just running around like a rabbid parkour runner.   The customization in the game is some of the best I've seen in any game. The variety of upgrades you can offer to both yourself and your ship gives you a ton of options to live out the ultimate pirate power fantasy as well as having a crafting system in the game just like in the previous AC game. Except there is insentive in this game cause you WANT a lv 4 gun pouch or better armor so you look like an even bigger op badass.   The PC version is buggy as hell though. But not in the sense that the game crashes every other auto save BUT the graphical glitches are nothing short of a borderline Unity in terms of faces dissappearing, NPC movement clipping, and other texture ♥♥♥♥ery.   But that does not stop the game from being GORGEOUS when everything is actually working. The lighting and rain effects are still phenominal almost 3 years later and it isn't that demanding if you pc is a bit more modern so most people can enjoy this game a very high graphics settings.   And finally in regards to the story. Edward Kenway's story and overall development is the best in the series since Ezio in AC2 (untill they dragged is character through the dirt for 2 more games) with some expected but still interesting twists as well as having memorable characters such as blackbeard and kidd.   This game is super cheap on sale at this point (got it for 7.50 this summer) so I more than recommend AC4 to anyone who wants to play quite possibly the best pirate game ever made.",

Pros:  If your still hooked on the freeroam city environment there are several good cities to relive your Esio/desmond or whatever days in rome, crowded streets, rooftop access everywhere, and killmove shananigans then go nuts at Kingston, Havana, Tortuga, etc etc.  The Naval Combat is easy to understand, fun to master. The controls are fairly intuitive and/or explained. Beautiful! Sailing in high wind down the coastline of lush coves and sea caves in a bangin ship listening to the surf and one of many shanties sung by your sailors. Sailing into 'rogue wave' is quite a thrill. Getting smashed by them is also a thrill.  Cons: Really minor cons IMO, but there are a few..... everynow and then you see a soldier climb a ladder into the sky or something goofy like that , but I could probably count on one or two hands the number of times that happened in one play through.  'Kenway's Fleet' is a fairly engaging side activity, but the 'mini-game' of launching battles is a little lame. Perhaps if it was more engaging or just omitted, sending the fleet out on just contracts would be alright by me.   All in all 10/10. It was a great buy for sale easter weekend, would pay FP.",

Edwaard Kenway (the character you play as) is a decent assassin, but he does a bad job at capturing what most assassins are soppossed to be like. however, he is pirate so I do not really mind as much. The story is decent atleast. It was not as serios as previose installments but I am not that surprised considering Ubisoft is really letting their games and fans down. Ubisoft through my eyes does a good job at being repetitive for most of their recent games. Anyways, being Edward is fun and all but I do tend to get a little annoyed at times but again, he is a prirate. Gameplay is not the best thing either. Almost Assassins creed game as this same problem, but none can compete with black flag. TRAILING MISSONS! Trailing missons are result of being lazy, and you can easily tell the lazyness in this game. Right from the start you chase, then you fallow another, then you chase and then you get bored. the first hour of the game is basically trailing missons. There is absolutely no variety with missons. Your having the same thing and sometimes you have to do in the smae old places. Even this happens when your on your ship. Its so annoying! Now on to sailing the sea! This part of the game is fun at times but also tends to get a little boring and repetitive. At first its a blast, but very quickly you will begin to yawn. Even though there is fast travel, at times I for some reason was unable to fast travel. I do not know really, if its the game or I am just stupid but I do know this...I got tired of it. So many times I had to go to the sameplaces that I have already visited on my stupid slow ship. Upgrading only makes a small difference, your just staring endlessly at the screen waiting till you get there but you feel like you never will. And then come across ships that want to kill you and your having to waste a lot more time doing the samething. That is another thing I wanna talk about. Raiding ships! This is one of my favourite things about the game. Have to tdestroy ships and take there loot is so fun, But just like like everything else I got a little bored of it.  Anyways, even though it was not my favourite Assassins Creed, it still is a good one. Mainly becasue you get to be a pirate in a not so piraty way. I totally would reccomend this game. And all the stuff I say is just my oppinion! But that all for this reveiw. Hope This Reveiw Helped You Out! Buy the Game on a sale but do not pay full price for it! ",

Mostly because there is just so much to explore. kill, collect, investigate, upgrade, customize and plunder :D. The map is huge! From plundering ships and castles to collecting chests in beautiful jungles. When travelling to your mission destination across the big sea you can have a sea battle with enemy ships.   If you are still wondering if you should buy this game then you should definitely google some sea battle's.    btw, bought it for 5 euro's on a sale.",

In this installment, Ubisoft added a new change where you may take your battles out to sea. However, once you reach the halfway point of the game, the sea battles tend to be very repetitive. They tried to keep you hooked with the option to upgrade your ship however that little treat gets very boring, very quickly. After a few attempts at hunting and fort destroying, I soon forgot what the storyline was even about. It doesn't have the same feel as the first 2.

Now, when it is 5$ i decided to show my appreciation to Ubisoft for this piece of art and buy it and relplay it for the 3rd time.  The game is nearly perfect from any point, the story is amazing, the gameplay is slightly improved from the previos AC games, but the enemies are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥ and i think they are also autistic and blind af, the naval combat is just dope, the sound is amazing when you hear your comrades singing while you sail around the sea and also the voice acting is amazing too, the graphics are amazing and it doesn't require a high PC to play it atleast on medium on a good frame-rate. When it comes to the multiplayer, i just can't recommend this kind of multiplayer. For me it isn't enjoyable and i think the AC games didn't need any multiplayer, but there are some players that maybe enjoy this thing.  All in all, I REALLY RECOMMEND this game. I just love everything about it, for me is the best AC game out there. 9/10, because there are some gameplay problems and glitches that just kinda ruin the experience.",

The story line in this game is great, and I want spoil anything but the story that you take journey in as Edward is very good, the story you take on outside of Edward, seems like it is a little lack luster but that is why it's a series. I'd persume that the rest of the series plans on slowly capturing the world outside of the animus.  I heard lots of things about the graphics of this game being to much for others PC's. Well I have a standard gaming PC, it's fairly decent. I was a little worried when picking up this game but I have been able to run the whole thing on high graphics with no issues whatsoever.   If I was to say anything bad about this game, it'd be the weapons... If I am not mistaken there may have been a few more in A3 and Brotherhood but I think the gameplay makes up for it. The outfits in this game are nice as well, I love the hoody assassin look but sometimes it's good to take a few steps away from that and they have the options to do that.   I have lots more good to say about this game, but I really don't feel like leaving a 2 page review and I don't think anyone wants to read it haha.  But I give this game... 7/10 on gameplay mechanics 9/10 on graphics 3/10 on multiplayer (no ones online not their fault) 9/10 on storymode  Overall I would give this game a 8/10. If I could play AC Online and expect a good amount of people and good game modes without having to buy the new release each year that'd be great. I really think Ubisoft should develop some sort of MMO off the AC world, with pirating and other MISC stuff. but thats irrevelant.  Good game would recommend, will continue playing even after story mode.",
