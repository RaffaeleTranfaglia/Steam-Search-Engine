            "review_text": " My full review can be found here.  [www.the-backlog.net]   Disclaimer: I was provided a key by the developer for review purposes.  Vagrant Hearts follows the story of Beatrice and Scarllet as they journey to the Brotherhood. There they'll discover secrets better left hidden, both within the Brotherhood and in the world. While they'll remain separated for most of the game, the story still follows them as they join up with new companions.  Vagrant Hearts is, for the most part, your typical turn-based RPG title. The thing that makes it stand out most is the Crest system. You can equip 4 crests to one character at a time, though the most useful crests are definitely the Light/Dark damaging ones, and those that can cause Paralyze or Poison. Those two status effects are extremely strong and will greatly aid in taking down battles that might otherwise decimate you. Unfortunately with how much the party splits up, Crests will get left behind on the other team, meaning you'll have to balance out who has what.  While I do recommend this title, I recommend trying to find it on sale (as it seems to be on sale frequently enough). The story is enjoyable enough, although there are numerous spelling and grammar errors. There are also a couple sprite issues that come up - two characters still have their white background, with one of them gaining it after not initially having the issue. As said, however, the game is still enjoyable enough, and definitely worth picking up and playing if you can get it on sale.  Just be warned it does leave a major cliffhanger for Vagrant Hearts 2!",
