That said, the game was really well done during the duration of my playthrough.  I would recommend the game at a smaller price tag, when that happens.",

Like with shelter 2 the Art and graphics are superb and unique and provided a good story, Paws messed with my emotions like with Shelter 2 and I found it an enjoyable experience. The only problem I found is that it's short and could of been a bit cheaper but overall I do love this game.",

It's not really worth it for 15 $ but i'd say its worth around 7 $. It took me about 1 hour to finish the game on first try. The game is not really survival it's more of a story about this little lynx cub and friendship. But overall loved the game should get it when it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "Shelter 2: paws was not a disappointment with the artwork, as usual, and like it's predecessor, shelter 2, it is open-world. The music helped show the mood of the game in a very effective way. The controls are easy to learn, the same as Shelter 2. I liked how the hints didn't lead me through the whole game, just handy enough to show me what to do the first time 'round but subtle enough to ignore on other plays. I also appreciated that it isn't just a play-through and you've now seen it all, you need to play it more than once, to build the puzzle pieces. One thing I found difficult though, was camera response, different from shelter 2. No matter how I tinkered with settings the camera never quite followed and gave me the feeling of weights on my cursor. I think this may get better with time though, so don't let it spoil this fantastic game!",

I do love this game, but it was a little short (and i think its a tad bit pricy for its length)like Shelter. But unlike shelter, there is still more to discover. I have only played through once so i havent discovered everything yet. This game will probabaly be played by me over and over for a while to come. 9/10",

            "review_text": "Paws: A Shelter 2 Game tells the story of a lynx cub that gets seperated from its family and tries to find the way back to them. On your way you must be very careful and sneaky as you walk through the swamp and the forest. By using your scent ability you can see your mothers footprints and thus easily follow them to continue... you'll meet a bear very soon and become friends with him. The bear will help you in finding your family and who knows, maybe you already found it?   Gorgeous game with a lovely story and beautiful graphics. I was literally running around hearing 'screenshot-worthy, screenshot-worthy...!' in my head and I did take a lot! Also hunting frogs, birds and butterflies is a fun-thing to do, there are few achievements to unlock by doing so. I recommend not to rush the story, take your time through the levels, check out everything and properly and you might find something of interest. Unfortunately the game doesn't take long to finish. I would've loved more story, collectables, dangerous/dramatic moments so I could've enjoyed it even longer.",

I felt like the controls were maybe a bit more sluggish than in the previous games but truthfully it has been a while since I played them. Kinda wanted a fully happy ending but not including one didn't make this game bad at all.  10/10 would get a heart attack from a swan attack again.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: If you want this game, get it on sale. But be aware that it is short and also has a terrible camera and clunky controls. Also if you often get motion sickness from games, this might cause problems for you.   Longer version:   This game is cute. I really really wanted to really enjoy it, even knowing that it was just going to be a short romp.   Unfortunately trying to play with mouse and keyboard was an absolute nightmare. I spent a while just trying to make the camera not a wildly swinging around pain in the ♥♥♥, and eventually just gave up and settled on the static camera so I could actually start playing. And even once I did start playing, I had to keep stopping to close my eyes and deep breathe because I was getting incredibly motion sick.  The controls are.. meh. I don't know. It felt like even with the sensitivity turned down trying to move around would often result in me having to zig zag around, making my motion sickness worse. It's weirdly difficult to get back to moving in a straight line.  I'm sure, with a lot of fiddling around, I could have the controls and camera be actually manageable, but who even knows about the motion sickness. It's a real deal breaker for me, though I'm sure I'll try playing again anyway. It's still something you should keep in mind if you also get motion sickness from games.  ",
