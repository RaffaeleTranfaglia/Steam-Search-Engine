Cute factor: - Simple as a peg: run-jump-collect cats - The ingame music - CATS! - Jones himself - Overall style - Trading cards, emoticons and backgrounds  Annoying part: - The main menu music (so depressive, even it's not intented to) - Cats are too realistic (MEOW-MEOW-MEOW) - Some of the text - The Twitter function (just for posting points on it, not required, but still) - When you die... :'(  But still: 3â‚¬ is not much, especially if you bought/buy in bundle cheaper.",

            "review_text": "Timing, timing is everything with this game. So you see a kitty hanging there? You jump to save him/her and come down. Oh no! There was a log! In this game you NEED to pay attention to where you are going and where you will land when jumping.   On the gameplay side of things it's simplistic, but has that old style level runner that a lot of us grew up with as kids. Controls are simble, jump, slide, etc. Doesn't take long to learn them. Especially if you complete the tutorial in the beginning. (I recommend this) You start at hazard level 1, 2hp (Or times you can land in fire or smash into something) before you lose a life. Not to worry! You start with 3, and they appear to regen over time provided you clear a level. When the counter reaches 0, well I'm sure you can guess what happens! It is however a bit hardcore afterward as you drop back to level 1. However, unlike most games that drop you back, you retain all your perks and or upgrades you had purchased previously. This is nice, and certainly helps you continue to climb higher and higher each time you go through runs. Your only objective is simple! You run out there and rescue kitties! And depending how many you rescue, you got it! Determines your over all score for the level and how many points you earn to spend at the actual upgrade stations.   Art style wise it's cute. It's not overly complex, but it doesn't look terrible either. I recommend playing the game to find out! (Music is pretty fun as well but gets slightly repetitive. Thats my personal opinion however!)   All in all I will give this game a 7/10, it did put a smile on my face and I will recommend it to friends and others looking for a decent level runner style of game!",

            "review_text": " Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",
