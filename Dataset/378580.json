            "review_text": "My life as a cougar... Killed a massive pack of wolves right next to den with cubs, then some super cougar spawned in or somethin and I had to drag my snail cubs up a massive cliff.   One of my cubs got stuck inside a rock.   When I finally got one of my two cubs up the massive mountain, I had to do the same for my other cub.  When I finally got my other cub up the massive mountain, the first cub decided he could fly, and walked off the edge of the cliff.  He got stuck there on the side of the mountain, I couldn't reach him because I would just slide down with no way of jumping up to scale the mountain...   After a 2nd try I gave up.  Also, this killer cougar or whatever wouldn't move on my map, so idk...  Still a pretty well-designed game, basically Wolf Quest with a giant mountain.",

            "review_text": "This Game? It's Amazing, and Slightly Challenging. At The Start It was really hard to get a single piece of prey since i was convinced i had to stalk it, instead of chasing it (My Main Strategy As Of Now Is Chasing.) I've Not Played For TOO long, however, since i quit the moment the first 'Killer Male' Spawned. I Mean, It Worries Me To Force The Cubs To Move So Far Away...  I Died Twice Before, Once When Being Chased By A Dog Pack, And Once More At The Hands Of An Eagle. My Main Target as of now is predators and killer prey, i was stalked by a fox to my den (At The Left Corner, But A Little Bit Upwards..) Anyways, This Isn't Much Of A Review As It Is Me Just Rambling On And On About My Own Gameplay Instead Of The Aspects And Other Of It, But Still..  10/10 Would Fail To Stalk Prey Again",

Turning off the looped music on the menu option, and the music is right there back when you start the game.  It look like someone first unity3d project using free 3d model and a quick poorly executed world made over the course of a couple hour.  The simulator is probably the only thing worth, except it fail to be one. I am glad i only paid 2 buck during the sale, it's barely worth the money at all. ",
