My only complain is something that don't quite have to do with the game itself, its just that the community is still too little, so there arent so many people to play right now. So it would be nice if this game got a little more popular soon.",

The nonsense of the combat is always funny even if you die horribly and the suprise of thinking you have an enemy cornered only to have him jump over you and extend the battle makes it very random. Overall 7/10 because it has a limited map(the basic ground and area) rotation  Addressing Negative Commentors: Most negative reviews mention lag and lack of players but i havent had either of those in my experience (the usual multiplayer low pop is only an issue mid day and early morning 4am to around about 3pm) The gamemodes are fun and the camping issues are ussually dealt with in game by a function allowing stickers to start appearing on youself if you sit still too long.",

The game is super fun once things get going, though. Again, it's very simple, yet very addicting, and all you want to do is get back at that one box who keeps killing you constantly. I just wish the game would run just a tad smoother, and that it wouldn't freak out and freeze, forcing me to quit and restart...",

Well, a friend gifted it to me, but I ended buying 5 copies and gifting it to people. This game is dumb fun, and that is why it is awesome. I am not very good at it, but I have played it for hours in one sitting and not been tired of it. Every round, every map, even with the same people, is different and fun. Red team vs blue team adds to that.  In short, this game is the dumb fun game I didn't l was looking for. I look forward to a game night with people I know, and I highly recommend it for group games. You'll be screaming the title by the night is over.",
