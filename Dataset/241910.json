            "review_text": "The final chapter of developer Daedalic Entertainment's award-winning point-and-click adventure series is sadly coming to a close. Goodbye Deponia completes the trilogy following the exploits of one of the most hilarious antiheroes ever to grace the gaming scene. Since the first game, Rufus has failed in every attempt to escape the garbage world of Deponia and enter a life of luxury on the floating spaceship city called Elysium. Does Goodbye Deponia finally see our 'hero' achieve his dream? Well, no spoilers here. You'll have to finish the story and see for yourself.  What I can tell you is that Goodbye Deponia keeps the exact gameplay formula from the past games, but cranks up the insanity to stratospheric levels. I wouldn't have thought it possible after some of the jaw-dropping moments found in the second game of the series, Chaos on Deponia. After all, we saw Rufus offer a shoe to a homeless person to eat, purposely get our leading lady Goal struck by lightning, and knowingly had baby dolphins chopped up and processed into cans of tuna.  I kept wondering whether Goodbye Deponia would finally see Rufus mature, and even find his moral center. Nope. Rufus is just as egotistical, self-congratulatory, and selfish as ever, with a horseshoe shoved firmly up his ♥♥♥♥. At times, you'll be ashamed at yourself for laughing at some of his pranks, but it's impossible not to. The scriptwork in this final chapter is absolutely flawless, and delivered pitch perfect by the veteran cast of voice actors.  But it's not just Rufus and his antics that deliver a gold-star performance. The entire ensemble is crafted with loving care, each character with their own personality that after two games you will have found yourself emotionally attached to: Doc as the master tinkerer that Rufus is always trying to belittle, Bozo and his pacifist nature, even Rufus' snobbish 'twin' Cletus, whom you're never quite sure who's side he's on. And lest we forget Goal, whom Rufus tries to charm to no end, who is more adorable than ever... you'll see why.  As a point-and-click adventure game, Goodbye Deponia follows all the standard conventions. Gameplay consists of jaunting through areas, searching for items to pick up and interact with, with puzzles scattered around that require solving in order to advance the story. However, the Deponia series crashes through conventional realism barriers due to the nature of the story and the idea that any item can be plausibly accepted by the player since the action occurs on a planet comprised of trash. Thus, Goodbye Deponia requires you to think outside of the box... way outside. Any obtainable object can be placed in Rufus' coat pockets, no matter the size, whether it's a living creature or an open flame. These objects can sometimes be combined to create new items.Characters help at impasses by retaining any conversation options that provide hints to solving the particular dilemma.  Visually, Goodbye Deponia is as gorgeous as ever. It's not so much a technical improvement over the last two games, but rather a clear sense of style and creativity that comes from Daedalic's artist, and the dedication that goes into each hand-drawn scene. The background animations in each area depict the dilapidation of the garbage world, although the actual travel of each character has set animations that at times feels out of place.  The music and sound effects feel genuine to the backdrop. Everywhere you go there are oddly constructed gadgets and poorly maintained appliances that fizzle, rattle, and chug along. The ambient music is filled with industrial-style synthesized beats, all very appropriate to the scene. And of course, the break in between each chapter is one I eagerly look forward to, where our banjo-playing bard of a narrator regales us with a jovial recap of the action and the manly chorus closes it out, followed by an epic orchestral climax  I apologize for anyone hoping for more tidbits about the story itself, but as the final chapter in a cult-inducing series, I have little doubt that fans will want to experience each sidesplitting moment of Goodbye Deponia for themselves. It is a great finish to a truly original tale, and a trilogy that anyone not already familiar with the series should absolutely purchase and enjoy. The only tragedy of Goodbye Deponia is that it truly is the final farewell to all our friends on Deponia.",

Some of the humour is lost in translation (quite literally bcause some of the lines would have been far funnier in the original german) but it still gets some really good laughs even if a few fall flat.  If you enjoy point and clicks with a sense of humour and the absurd, play this game... hell play the series.",

            "review_text": "Goodbye Deponia is a satisfying conclusion to Daedalic's trilogy.  It has the imaginative puzzles of the first Deponia, a satisfying move away from the terrible puzzles of Chaos on Deponia. It's lengthier than the previous offerings so there is a great deal more to do, some locations from the previous games are revisited albeit in the form of different areas of those places. and most importantly Rufus, is still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but is not nearly so callous as in the previous games, a final recognition of his character development. HOwever As for Argus and Cletus, well once again Daedalic fail somewhat there, in fact the largest rub I've had with the Deponia games is the lack of true understanding of their characters psychology. Daedalic tend to go for gags and tropes with the characters there to fill in the holes. This is unfortunately very apparent. It's a pity the writers have focused on the humour more than on their character motivations, it does seem to be improving however as they have gained in experience through the series.  The bizarre Piers Anthony humour still abounds, and the game has a plethora of pop culture references to find and discover.  The quirky art style is still just as appropriate to the underlying themes, and the vibrant, mechanisticly lush environments are as wonderful as ever. The music (much of it rehashed from previous games) is enjoyable without becoming overwhelming. As for the Chorus Guys... well their lyrics are still just as awkward to try and 'sing'...  Overall I will recommennd the game, however it needs to be played with Deponia and Chaos on Deponia as well, so if possible try buy it as a part of a package deal, and not standalone.",

            "review_text": "This was a hugely disappointing conclusion to the amazing Deponia series. Not just because of the lacklustre ending to the plot, but also because of the ugly nature of many of the acts of Rufus. In previous games he was a crazy but lovable hero, whereas in Goodbye Deponia, he is responsible for selling a black woman into slavery to a monkey who forces her to dance in a skimpy outfit, whilst you feed her boyfriend to some sort of mutant parasitic monster burrito vendor. He also is responsible for the deaths of a group of orphan children that he comes across, and feeding a baby an entire bottle of anti-depressant drugs. At the end he is also finally responsible for the death of his biggest fan, who jumps off the Highboat when Rufus falls.  Overall, this game was a massive let down, and the ending to the plot made it even more of a waste of time, as the eventual result could have been achieved by just letting Cletus and Goal return to Elysium in the very first game, but many more lives would have been saved in the process.   If you love the Deponia series - Do. Not. Play. This. Game.",

            "review_text": "  Received for free via Steamified.  Wow. Absolutely stunning. For people who want to miss out on the rest of my baller review, here's a TLDR:  Overall: 8/10  Pros: -the story is top notch, on a basic narrative level the game does a very good job -manages to mix up the gameplay in a lot of surprising ways, which is especially notable because it's a point and click -the art is really fleshed out -characters are well developed, each with their own unique quirks and attitudes -the soundtrack and voice acting is reeally well done  Cons: -the game suffers from a few problems that many point and click adventure games share -gameplay can get pretty confusing, especially in the Thid Act - the game can be slow at times, especially when trying to figure out some of the more involved puzzles.  Okay, so time for the rest of the review. First off, I have to say that I am a really big Daedalic fan. These guys are easily the one of the most consistent producers of high quality point and click adventure games in modern video game meta. They're really consistent with their quality and have a really good line up of games. Also, they crank out games faster than Jeb Bush dropped out of the presidential race, which is a really good rate to be at.   Having said that, Goodbye Deponia, is no exception. It is the third entry into the Deponia series, and serves as a type of conclusion to the story, as the fourth entry serves more as a nostalgic revisitation of the characters rather than a canonical entry. Goodbye Deponia is a really great conclusion to the series and has a lot of good qualities, and the cool thing is, you DO NOT need to have played the past two entries in the series to enjoy this game. Although they're necessary to fully enjoy the game's little references and homages to past titles, the game does a lot of things very well that allow it to stand on its own. The game features a lot of minigames and untraditional puzzles that require a lot of thinking outside the box. All of these minigames, however, do have a 'skip' option for all you purists out there. A big feature of all the Deponia games, especially this game, is the constant quality of the art style, soundtrack, and voice acting. Every single artistic aspect of the game is polished to near perfection; the attitude of the game is greatly portrayed through the characters' dialogue. Each one has unique qualities that make the game pop. The game, however, has its downfalls. As a point and click adventure game, it executes the formula very well. There are a few very confusing instances, especially within the Third Act, that I needed to use a guide for. Also, the game ends in a satisfying yet open ended way, leaving the player with satisfactory feelings, while leaving much still open to player interpretation. Although great, this game still had flaws and areas of improvement. But then again, games that don't have those things are few and far between. As such, I give Goodbye Deponia a solid 8/10.",

            "review_text": "This game is so frustrating on so many levels for it is very challenging to advance with the game. It took me more time than the first two Deponia games combined to finish. And I even replayed both gameplays! While I did enjoy the puzzles, I absolutely despised having to go through the agonisingly e n d l e s s dialogues. I progressed very little with the story   that I considered myself lucky I stumbled upon random items, accidentally combine the items, even had to unintentionally switch the items in the inventory between the Rufuses.   I admit I had to (constantly) look up walkthroughs to progress with the game.  The 3rd Deponia isn't as enjoyable as the 1st Deponia in terms of gameplay and storyline. In the first game, you're on board with the story of this egotistical narcissistic self-proclaimed 'hero' saving his home and envisioning his life on some flying utopian city but in the third game, the story changes in a way that cheapens the efforts of the earlier games. The focal story is there: Rufus still needs to save Deponia from its impending doom   but introducing the character Hermes into the story as their “creator” wasn't as meaningful as intended. It makes everything seem flexible; you can clone literally anyone. If you can cheat death by cloning, surely you can cheat doomsday by crafting another crummy Deponia-esque world.    I was curious how Rufus and Goal were going to protect Deponia, since the two games have been relentlessly trying to accomplish that. So why not own the third game as well? At the start, I was neutral about the 3rd instalment, however the game drags on, and it just became repetitive, monotonous, and tiresome. Nevertheless, I actually liked the unorthodox ending. It shows Rufus’ development from a self-centred egomaniac to a somewhat altruistic noble hero.  5/10 for gameplay – too much dialogue and hidden items but good puzzles (puzzles were simple enough to solve); 5/10 for story –   did not fancy this Hermes and the cloning factory   but has a nice enough ending to conclude the whole trilogy. Overall 5/10 – Kind of on the fence with this last one. While the first two were a lot more enjoyable than this, 'Goodbye Deponia' still has some decent puzzles and ended the story on unconventional but refreshing terms.",

But I stuck with it, because I totally fell in love with this world and its characters over the course of the series. But then that ending -- what a disappointment. After the story treads water in chapter after chapter of meaningless, disconnected puzzles, to spend seemingly so little time and effort on that ending, it just felt kind of lazy. The series as a whole deserved better, IMO. Play it to get series closure, and some interesting story developments, but don't expect the sort of culmination this story deserves. 7/10.",

Wish it spoke more to the rest of the people but it is left to the audience to reflect upon.",

It's my favorite game of the trilogy due to the character arch and development of Rufus, the newfound humor, mechanics, fourth-wall breaking narrative, and the stylish and innovative mini-games. The ending was sad, yes, but it was incredibly poetic and symbolic. Two thumbs up Daedalic.",
