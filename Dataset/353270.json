            "review_text": "This game has a niche target audience so I'll do my best to outline it below. If i have to give a rating I would give it an 8/10 and reccomend getting it on sale. I'm very aware that while I enjoy these games reccomending them is a bit dodgy as alot of people simply will not like what this game is. It does what it tries to do but that wont appeal to ALOT of people.    REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS GAME: This game is not mechanically deep, characters roles are pretty simple to figure, beyond buffs debuffs and manipulating the turn system theres not alot to learn, the last one is a nice touch but still not a good game for someone who wants to think hard about their strategy.  Story is pretty poor in general (though not even close to as bad as rebirth 2 imo) and it has alot of repetition in monsters, dungeons etc.   The game is rated 12+ and that age level seems appropriate so if you're looking for adult images, look elsewhere. Fanservice is tame and sporadic.  It has quite alot of post game content through the free dlcs but unfortunately there is pretty much no way to progress to the last 4 areas or higher level fights in a natural way. To do these you simply turn on the 'in-game power level hax' and grind levels for an hour or two. This means that to keep things fun post game you have to carefully balance your levels or else you will be annihilated/untouchable.  The difficulty is a bit low for alot of the games until you reach the ultra late-game at which point it reaches stupid levels and the only way to balance is essentially to be really careful about how you break the game (see above point)  The 4th wall gets SMASHED repeatedly here. All the games broke the 4th wall but this one just completely ignores to the point where even I got annoyed in later chapters and I'm normally immune to it.  REASONS TO BUY THIS GAME: The games characters are the main draw. Its a mix of a visual novel with a turn based rpg and the characters keep the visual novel element highly entertaining for the most part. Having all the dlc characters active can make it a bit too much dialogue wise so I reccomend not using them for a first playthrough if you intend to do more than 1. Some of the characters might drive some people crazy and as obvious as it might sound, anime like characters and reactions are plentiful so if you like anime you probably have a higher chance of liking this though I'm sure its not necessary.    Having plutia and Nep as the 2 of the 3 main characters pretty much makes this game for me.     Is funny.... well I think so anyway :D  The battle system while simple is fun to play and the animations are really smooth. If you have played the other games you have a good idea whats going on but this one is a step up on this front, not anything massively different just little things that make game more fun to play. The entire interface is massively improved in this game too, it still has its flaws but the menu in this game alone is enough to make it the best of the three.  Theres a challenge system introduced where you get little bonuses by completing challenges and while some of them are a little painful and the higher targets in many are RIDICULOUS, its still a nice addition.  The game isnt too short at about 40-60 hours for a casual playthrough of true ending if you read everything, certainly not long by rpg standards but long enough that you wont feel ripped off.",

            "review_text": " Another nep adventure is over and another review is coming up. This one will be more like changes between previous games and this one.   Stella's Dungeon Now this system became more related with game and most of the time items you need or plans or anything you can get only from there. Not like in the re;birth 2.   Interface Menu has changed (like someones cares about it ._.). Now because of 2 different dimensions we have 2 different maps. First one is our good-old hyperdimension simliar to re;birth 2 map, but this dimension is not here as main one becuase we can do stuff here only at start or end. Because of this not a lot of dungeons appear here. Second one is more unique and new becuase they did like you must to enter in country to get into its basilicom or dungeons, thats really cool and because of this there is lot of place for dungeons. There are also plans to change music in main menu and in fights i like those ^-^   Treasure system This one I don't like that much because treasure system here depends more on luck. Because you need to jump to get items like in mario but you have a low chance drop for some plans or costumes and this is really annoying when you need to waste time to just farm them so many times. Besides after you finish game and make last steps and finishing with plans most of them you can find only in hidden treasures.   Post game New really good thing they did that after you completed the game you still can be in world and there is no need to start a new game again you can do it whenever you want. Besides with dlc came a lot of additional fun content like 'regu and bamo story', 'searching for treasure', 'island r18', 'trial period?'    Story They made story really cool here and long. 10 chapters in case of true ending, besides really a lot of additional dialogs which are really cool and with cool arts so don't miss them! What about endings? You don't need more farm shares with tears on your eyes to get that or another ending. Here everything is really easy you just need to collect items or check for special events.   Colosseum Here they changed only a bit they just added a... let's just call this a 'second round'. After you kill one enemy you think 'oh good this is done' there shows up another one, and more and more :D So be carefull with them. One more thing is, which I really dont remember if this was in previous parts but here from colosseum battles you don't get exactly weapons or armour you just get plans for them and guess what? On higher levels the item you need for plan is obtainable only from Stella's Dungeon and of course with low chance of drop ._.  I guess thats all what i wanted to say. Of course I recommend this game, I really like it same as previous ones. See you in next reviews :) Bye!   Some challenges for me: Complete everything: 999 lvl, beat all ultimate bosses, earn all ultimate weapons, all achieves -  done ,  done ,  my real hours and stats     Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 1review   Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 2 review  ",

It still has a serious plot and many touching scenes. 2. Loveable characters, all of them (Yes even the villains in this game are hilarious and loveable).  3. Relaxing and easy gameplay 4. Plenty of grind and replay value 5. Anime art style (which is my personal preference)  It is a very good game for you to have a laugh and relax.

            "review_text": "I've finally done it! I'm done drinking the kool-aid, stopped believing in false deities, and I've been Nep-Nep free for ... not even a year. Oh No... As much as I hate to admit it, Compile Heart's opus to moe console wars has succesfully stolen another 40+ hours of my time. Instead of playing Undertail or whatever it is the kiddies are going ga-ga for, I surrendered myself to the latest entry in the Neptunia Saga.   Now why would I do such a silly thing?  By now, we're all familiar with how the Hyperdimension Neptunia formula works. These games are not known for their complex dungeons, intricate plots, or especially difficult battles. They're Sunday Funday affairs, the kind designed to make you feel like the good and awesome person that you are. You're smashing those wacky monsters by the thousands, crafting plans to unlock neat stuff, and enjoying a thorough introspective on the console industry and boob-jokes. That said, formulas eventually become stale. There's only so much that can be done with a concept. An injection of fresh ideas or even a change of direction is necessary to keep a game series interesting.   How does Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation accomplish this daunting task? Um... It doesn't.  But it's like I always say: When the Devil isn't in my Crystal Light, he's in the details. Nep-Cubed stays fresh not by messing with the formula, but by improving on practically every aspect. First off, let's talk about the characters. In the last game, Nepgear is a nice girl, but she was saddled with the unfortunate task of playing an everyday heroine. The Neptunia series isn't built for characters like her. So, in N3p not only do we get Neptunia being her usual absurd self, she's joined by Plutia. With this gal, it's either sleepy-time or sadomasochistic time. Nepgear returns, but she's become a trifle touched in the head, possibly due to all of the complaints about how normal and boring she was. Noire also gets main-character duty this go-around. Her personality is: 'It-It's not like I  want  to play the straight-woman or anything!' Nearly everyone else makes an appearance in the story and/or the dozens upon dozens of optional cutscenes. Whereas Re;Birth 2 was lacking in personality, this game is practically a personality explosion.   You know what else I disliked about Neptunia 2? Being stuck with the same party-members for the vast majority of the game. R3;Birth neps that issue in the bud. As soon as chapter 1, a deluge of playable characters are dropped in your proverbial lap. These heroines also receive a new ability called 'awakening'. It's basically an HDD-level boost for non-CPUs/Candidates. Share-shenanigans are a thing of the past as well. Once you reach the specific point in the story, you'll unlock a character, no colosseum or quest grinding necessary.   The battle-system has received some slight revisions. The SP meter is tied into the CPU's ability to perform EXE moves. So if you perform so many special moves, or cast enough healing spells, you won't be able to perform EXEs, until you attack the enemy to rebuild the lost meter. There are also less EXE moves in general. While these changes can be considered nerfs, this attempt at balance makes the fights a little more complicated than: spam rush combos &gt; spam EXEs &gt; spam level-up screens. Still, unless you're actively trying to stay weak, you'll shred 90% of the enemies in this game.  Another practically life-changing improvement is the 'search' function. When you can't be arsed to remember where a 'magical contract' or a 'magical contact' can be found, you can run an in-game search. Yes, shift+tab and the nearest FAQ in the Steam community is available, but at least it's obvious that Compile Heart cares. Stella (ugh) also makes her return. She's got a nice racket going doesn't she? Everytime she makes an appearance in a Neptunia game, the urge to buy DLC rises by 5,000,000%. This time around she's exploring a massive tower. A number of extremely useful plans are tied to this tamogotchi nightmare, so you might as well fork over that extra dollar. At least it doesn't take her 12+ hours to explore the later locations.  But you know what? One of the best qualities of R3;Birth is those times where it shows some charm. I mean, okay there's still plenty of fan-service, the plot and villains being ridiculous, and the overabundance of cute girls doing kyuuuute thangs. Somewhere underneath all of that nonsense, there are rare moments that warm the ancient &amp; cavernous ruins I consider to be my heart. I'd be perfectly content if this series was just a farce, but it understands the right ways to capture my attention. Then again, for all I know this is just another method Nep-fever sinks it's claws into my soul. Idea Factory is making sure I stick around to buy Neptunia VII, and the musou-like hack &amp; slash, and the Noire SRPG, and Blanc Vs Zombies, and the Sega Hard Girls cross-over...  It's questionable how long I'll be able to participate in this rodeo. The Re;Birth series always does enough to keep the players addicted, and this entry is a continuation of everything that works. If you're expecting something more, then I don't know what to tell you. You certainly can't expect to enjoy this game if the previous entries didn't grab you. However, if you're a fan, then I'm positive that this entry won't disappoint.",

            "review_text": "100% all 3 of the Neptunia games and they tried to do it a bit different in this one, which is not always good.  First what i liked:  + They removed share character locks, share endings or having way to many endings + Its Neptunia what can you say more   Now what i dont like:  - They added an item that you only can get 1 time per true ending and is needed to make some of the best weapons in the game, which is really dumb and just a cheap way to replay the game - They added the achievement system from Fairy Fencer and you are forced to do specific tasks to unlock really important plans for each character which gets annoying - This game is probably the grindiest one of all Neptunia games, because there is really no fast way to make xp and money like in the other games, where you got a lot in the colosseum in a decent amount of time - They also increased the prices for items in the shop by a lot, for example each best weapon in the game cost 10million alone, not even speaking of all the other stuff you can buy, which is also a really cheap way to extend the play time  So overall they tried to change a few things which are good but the most changes they did i really dont like its just like they wanted to extend the game time by making one time items, enormous prices, annoying achievements and really low xp and money rate to make it a grind fest. Dont get me wrong i have nothing against grinding but as someone who always wants to 100% a game this seems way to much, gets boring and is really just a cheap way to make the game last longer.  For Neptunia fans and people who dont care having everything in the game buy it for people who want everything get ready for the struggle",

The good :)   ~Seeing more of this series coming over is a nice thing.  ~Being able to have all the DLC at once instead of waiting for it in pieces is nice.  ~Plutia and Neptune are amazing ~Scouts are gone, replaced with Stella's Dungeon. ~Battles are handled extremely fast.  The Bad :(  ~The conversations and events can easilly last 30 minutes to an hour without seeing any actions.  ~The dungeons are frequently reused with different sets of enemies.  ~There is a lot of dialogue, but there is not as much voice acting as the first game...which is what I love to see.  ~I would have loved to see dialogue which would poke fun at the fact that the characters are in a 'new game+'  ~Battles are really about overpowering enemies and not truly using that many tactics.  ~DLC Characters are extremely overpowered until around Chapter 6 - 8.   ~GLITCH: Very rarely, if a player had played for many hours...sometimes the game would crash entering battle.   The truth when taking Global Steam Stats into account:   The game maintains an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' review considering its a port and slight remake of the 2012 game Neptunia Victory. However at the time of this writing:   ~Only 80% of the playerbase chose to start the game.  ~Only 52% of the playerbase completed the prologue chapter.  ~Only 47% of the playerbase completed the first chapter. ~Only 37% finished the second chapter.   ~Less than 5% of the playerbase had the resolve and endurance to finish the game and actually see the ending(s).  If one knows a little bit of math, one can say that out of the people who actually have played the game (80%), of that total population....we can write 52/.8 = 65. Basically two thirds of those who started the game went through the prologue chapter at most. However, when the math is applied....by the end of Chapter 2, less than half of the people who actually started the game) actually remained playing the game passed the second chapter.   The game is really for the playerbase who actually likes a combination of Visual Novels mixed with RPG interfaces in its own game. I love the game for its humor in a time where most games are super-serious and humorless, but even I admit that when I started the game to show my fiancee how the game started...it took an hour to go through the prologue chapter because most of it were the two of us reading it.   I am currently going through the New Game+ attempting to get the TRUE ENDING after getting the Good Ending. :) I am one of the few who actually went through the entire game ;)   Get this game if you have the patience to read a ton for a lighthearted, lukewarm story :) This game reminds me of games like Xenogears that beat out final fantasy in acquiring the award for 'most ridiculous amount of text' in a scene. :)",

The story is much of the same; humorous, silly, and with plenty of video game and movie references. Which can be the game's biggest issue if you don't get the references, since Re;Birth3 is mostly story. Why is this a problem? Well the game play is simplistic. Don't get me wrong, I love Nep-Nep, but the game play could be deeper. That being said, what's there is sufficient and isn't bad by any means (I've seen worse).   Buy this game if you want to get into this series and don't worry about it being the 3rd in the series. Some of the characters will fill you in at a few points if you missed anything. They're not detailed recaps, but hey they didn't have to do that.  So yeah, get this game over the other two, but the others are just as good, so get them later! :p",
