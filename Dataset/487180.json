            "review_text": "im not saying this novel game is bad or not worth the money, its just not very long or fleshed out. for example, i have finished it on my first try without dying once, in 5 minutes, the replay the game skipping the text for choices i have already don to beat it again in a different way in 3 mins. after replaying it many times and getting as many endings i can, my total time hasnt expanded past an hour. on top of that the bad ends just seem poorly done in a way that two routes will lead up to the same end or, also, a ending that doesnt change no matter what choices were made previosly. if im not making sense here just know this, i was dissapointed by the length and the meaningless choices that just seem to pad things out, very little on top of that. the good parts are aas followes: - a soundtrack, not the best for reading to but wasnt expecting this in a novel based game anyway - great artwork, this made for a more immersive experiance overall - an interesting world, just wish this was more fleshed out  cons: - very short, read opening paragraph - linear story, but multiple endings, this is hard to explain - not a text based rpg like i origanly thought, but thats my fault  overall this is just not my type of story, too short for me but i will say it is well worth the money, no problems there  if you want a short story with nice pictures then this is for you if not, well, too bad",
