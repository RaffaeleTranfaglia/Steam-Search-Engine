            "review_text": "I think, the game is not replayable. I experienced just one ending which is running with a baloon. I really do not wonder about other endings, because I have half-guesses about others.  There is open-town map which has steampunk atmosphere. I love everything about Steampunk, but I do not like the town. I think is not exactly Steampunk. I like the soundtracks, so I took the 'original soundtrack'. The soundtracks based piano like other RPGMaker games, not so specially. Dialogues with NPCs are incredible linear and boring. However some are interesting like    The lecture (I did not listen it. But if I try again later, I will do.)     6/10",
