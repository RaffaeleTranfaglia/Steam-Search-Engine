            "review_text": "The game pretty much exactly lives up to what you would expect from it. It's fast, it requires you to think quickly and act quickly but not to a level it get's really frustrating.   The artwork, well you either hate it or you love it. It's very simplistic with neon like effects at the same textures over and over again. But who gives 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about that anyway, the game is beautiful in many aspects. The music fits too, which ingame is much more ambient than the trailer(really didn't like the music there so that's a good thing too(♥♥♥♥ dnb)).   Few things you're not going to find in this game:  -&gt;A good storyline. There is one, and it consists of logs to clear up your lost memory(doesn't get more original than that hur dur). They aren't awfully well written either. I just looked at them and was like 'mmwyeah lets ignore those' lol  -&gt;Puzzles that require more than 2 braincells. It's just not a thinking game. Not to be confused with Portal, which has a somewhat similar style  -&gt;Enemies that are actually a treat to you. lol the enemies are probably the worst thing so far. They're just ''kamikaze cubes''(it's worse than it sounds though) and they're extremely predictably placed over the map. They've got a different color than regular cubes so you can just pick them off immediately. Somewhat saddening, but I didn't really need enemies in this game anyway.  Later on there're some more advanced enemies which I won't spoil. But they aren't really anything either, they're all pretty uninteresting by design(to me at least)   What you can expect however is:  -&gt;Some neat-o floating sky platform-world which makes as much sense as the idiot who came up with the idea of giving this game a '' storyline ''  -&gt;Smooth gameplay, apart from some minor pointers like getting stuck on the edge of some cubes here and there  -&gt;Clever level design  -&gt;The level design actually rewards you if you decide to go for an alternative route, which there're suprisingly many of.  -&gt;Some damn sweet and fitting sounds. Including the music  I mean for 40 euros this game might've been really dubious in more than 1 way. But for 10 euro, ah hell naw boii. You better get this, it's great.",

In the short period of time that I've spent playing the game, I have to say that it's as fun as it is beautiful. If ever I wanted to play a game using the Oculus Rift, this would be it.",

            "review_text": "So, Deadcore kind of appealed to me because it seemed like a fun puzzler in the style of the  Portal  series, it looked very futuristic/cyber and the overall graphics were very appealing. Additionally there's this whole mystery with 'What's on the summit of the construct?!' -- these thingies always totally suck me in.  It's really a game that lets you jump around a lot with a very interesting mix of jump'n'run finger agility tasks and at the same time some nice puzzle elements. You get a few different abilities to play with   (double jump, air dash, and the switch gun with two shooting modes, essentially)   and you progress only via checkpoints after a big puzzle or a small set of shorter sequences. There isn' a lot of story or anything that would immerse you deeply. You can find some logs on the way to uncover a few flavor texts adding to the experience but in the end it's always about getting up and wondering what's up there. Besides the hidden logs you can find a few upgrades for your abilities   (more ammo between checkpoints, higher juming, faster dash recharge, etc.)   and some music tracks.  For me, as someone who can be an aweful jump-precision dyslexic, the game took almost five hours in total for one playthrough with not nearly all upgrades and logs. Later playthroughs will be faster since you already got a bunch of upgrades and more experience. Also, once found, you will keep all your abilities even if you replay some levels which opens up new pathways to progress. Other than that there's not a whole lot of replay value unless you want to do speed runs and fight for a spot on the leaderboards.    The Yummies",

Avoid various obstacles and annoying enemies.  The game is difficult but not too difficult. Has frequent checkpoints.  It takes ~4 hours for the first playthrough to just reach the finish. But that's far from everything the game has to offer.  The exploration is really enjoyable. Each level is huge, and when you play them for the 2nd time you are able to find whole new branches with higher difficulty. There are also collectibles that are a challenge to hunt down.  And of course, there is the whole speedrun mode, for those who are into this.  Includes a lot of nice soundtrack.  ★★★★★★★★★☆",

This will appeal very strongly to css/cs/kz players who has been playing climb &amp; bhop, it feels very similar to those aspects as well as portal 1/2. The levels so far are a lot of fun, movements and in air abilities/the gun feels very smooth and mixes together well. The difficulty is rising each level and new abilities are being introduced at a decent pace. I havent finished the story part yet so I can't say much for the speedrun game mode but if it incorperates the trackmania leaderboards and keeps it clean of cheaters then this is gonna be a huge sucess!  And it's cheap too. F**k me.",

To be a better surfer, a base level understanding of map layout and player movement is essential to finishing with decent times. This same challenge applies to deadcore.  I see a lot of comparisons to portal here in the reviews. Specific sounds are played at different times (like when you launch off of an air lift) similar to Portal 2, but use of a portal gun (thinking with portals) has no comparison in deadcore, to me.  Deadcore is about movement, memorization and effectiveness. not puzzle solving, exploration, and story.   Deadcore allows for the player to decide their path based on their implementation of the dash, jump, and rocket jump. The gun is used to open doors, stun enemies, and rocket jump (for advanced players). I've been rewarded by this game's challenge, and I have enjoyed the upgradability and stortytelling from finding collectables.",

You pick up some powers as you progress including: - A gun that can turn some stuff on/off in levels. - Double jump - A super fast dash - A few others  You dont need to speedrun it. In fact, you will likely feel accomplished just making it through most of the areas.   Not a bad game at all. Pretty good fun in fact.  Cons: - Can be quite difficult (and thus frustrating)",

But the game quickly ramps up the difficulty and then pacing and fun breaks down; either because I am worse than average at FPS (I have always thought of myself as better than average but it is a possibility), this game is desinged only for hardcore fps players, or the game is simply too particular about players getting timing and movements exactly the way it wants.   As a result, I cannot think of a single person that I actually know that I could see enjoying this game as more than a quick playtest.",

            "review_text": "Fast paced platforming game makes you feel like god when you succeed after failing a lot.  It reminds me a lot of some of the fast-paced segments of portal 2 except that is what the enitre game is like. Fast dying, respawns and reasonable check points help keep it un-frustrating. The music is nice and keeps the gameplay feeling smooth and exciting.  The levels are well designed and really push the game's wierd futuristic aesthetic. There are often multiple paths to choose from and some are a bit hidden. Indeed, the game rewards you with various collectables for finding some of these areas. As you progress you will enounter new mechanics, often in the form of upgrades. These mechanics usually have to be exectued while platforming somewhat precisly and quickly in order to complete the levels.  Enemies are usually moving laser walls (instant death), turrets(fires a shot that pushes you back), giant fans, etc. This is not a game that focuses on combat and shooting these enemies will either do nothing or just disable them for long enough to run past them. In short, enemies are more like obstacles than enemies of a traditional FPS.  There is no real storyline to speak of but there is hidden lore in the form of logs hidden about. The logs are short but entertaining enough to read.  This game seems like the sort of thing that could be very competitive and there are high score boards if you are into that thing.  Not sure how long the game is but I picked it up for under 4 USD and 2.6 hours throughly enjoyed so far, I already feel like I got my money's worth.",

Lots of collectables, including ammo and ability upgrades, music tracks, story logs, and 'sparks' that open up new sections of levels. Made with speed runs in mind, including a mode specifically for speed runs. I enjoyed the hell out of it. Highly recomended if you are a fan of the genre.",

This is one of the hardest games i have played in a long time. You have to watch your movements very carefully and watch your back at all times.. one wrong step and your repeating. If you have ever played portal, then picture if you will, one of the higher level puzzles, you have to jump and while your falling open a portal and then when you enter you have to open another to get higher just to reach your platform.. this is sorta like that but x10 lol .. This difficulty almost rivals Dark Souls in such a way that you almost want to go play Dark Souls cause it might be easier at times.  If you think you can handle jumping puzzles and shooting while jumping without being able to stop for more than a second then go for it i dare you.. No i challenge you to play this game and see how far you can climb the spires of DeadCore.",
