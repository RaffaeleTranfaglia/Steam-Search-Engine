What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it? What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?",

Featuring a recursive level diving type system that allows you to go into your enemies, power ups and even yourself and change aspects of the respective object to change the game around. The gameplay itself is much like many other twin stick shooter type deals but a lot more tactical. I myself am not entirely sure who I'd recommend this to but it certainly is an interesting concept.",
