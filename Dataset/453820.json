            "review_text": "level 1: you only have warriors, boring level 2: you get archers. If you use your warriors you lose. then you can upgrade one of your units level 3 you get a spell. If you upgraded *or* use your archers you lose.  this is *not* good game design. Later on in the game you get multiple spells. sometimes you can't use a spell, but the game never tells you what causes this (is it a glitch?), it appears to *mostly* be that you can't cast the same spell twice in a row, but sometimes a spell stays disabled for 2 casts after you cast it. None of this is terribly bothersome. what is bothersome is that it doesn't *tell* you that you can't cast the spell. it just does nothing when you click the button.  furthermore. It's supposed to be a units based game, but anything other than the 'slow tanky warrior type' pretty much just gets obliterated by enemy spells immediately, so the only viable strategy I could find is spam tanks, continuously trade units with spells, and *very* slowly widdle down the enemy base. Not a fun game",

            "review_text": "  Awful. Just awful...  TLDR: Repetitive, annoying, no fun factor. Avoid.  Adding some more meat to the bones, the first thing I noticed was no graphics options. No resolution, nothing to fix even aspect ratio.  The game looks like an imported Facebook game, you start on a field with two opposing towers and then it's a click fest to spam identical looking soldiers/archers/etc who lack lusteredly lumber toward each other   Animations are poor in combat, flinching when hit with a helpful speech bubble to let you know they have been injured. The point seems to be to destroy the opposing teams castle by first defeating the waves who literally 'push' you back with each hit and vice versa.  There appears to be little thought out tactics as well. The brief amount of time I spent in the game so far suggests all unit spawning and powers have identical cool down timers.  The looping music also adds to the tedium and the whole experience gets old fast.",
