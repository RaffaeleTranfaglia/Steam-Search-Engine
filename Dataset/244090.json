            "review_text": "Turn-based lite strategy game about WW2 fighter planes. The premise is really interesting and I think the game mechanics are nicely executed. The planes each have a different feel, and the game does a good job of modeling 'energy fighting' (e.g. trading altitude for speed and vice versa) and roll/turn rates (a P40 will roll left/right within a hex; a Zero doesn't roll so good but can sustain a turn to 120 degrees, etc.)  Beyond that... it's a good thing this game is just $5 because it is woefully under-polished, especially for a Sid Meier title. The missions are very repetitive (180 are claimed, but they're really a variation on four or five missions with different enemy planes in them), the animations are clunky, and there are endless small boneheaded things that will annoy you.   It's very good for a tablet game, but I can't give it my full recommendation.",

            "review_text": "Ace Patrol Pacific Skies is basically the exact same game as Ace Patrol (which was set in WW1) moved to WW2 Pacific Theater where you play the Japanese side or the American side.   The game is best described as a turn-based air combat where you move planes from hex to hex, where the 'attitude' and 'altitude' of the plane, as well as the skill of the pilot, determines what moves you can make. If you are low, you can't use a power dive (drop several levels of altitude) or 'falling leaf' (drop several levels of altitude and face a specific direction), for example, or if you were in a left turn, you can't immediately switch to a sharp right turn (unless you learned 'roll' manuevers). This is harder to explain than to see for yourself by watching the videos.   You control 2 or 4 planes and corresponding pilots. As pilots make 'kills' they gain experience that can be translated to better power moves. So it's not good if you let one pilot do all the killing... Share the bounty.   In a bit of ahistorical equality, there are female pilots (fortunately, you can turn that off).   Try not to let your pilots get shot down. They can be kept prisoner or end up in hospital for several missions. The planes themselves can also be damaged and repairs are not instantaneous.   Typically you have about 6 missions per 'year' and there's a big mission at the end. and 4 years in a campaign. You are scored based on how much damage you caused, did you complete your objective (such as taking out a ground target), vs. how much damage did you suffer.   If you like Ace Patrol, Pacific Skies is the same game with faster planes.",

            "review_text": "Purchased this on a whim in the Christmas sale. I like turn based hex games, I like the history of the Pacific Air War. Sounded like it might be worth a look and it certainly was. Basically a boardgame where the computer controls your opponent and handles all the dice rolls for you - if that is your thing, this is an enjoyable board game for you. You can upgrade your aircraft and pilots if you are succesful in battle. The game consists of many small rounds, so this is also a great game for when you have just a few minutes to spare - do a mission and save the next for later. Multiple skill levels allow you to have relatively easy to quite tricky missions to achieve. I've spent far more time playing this than I ever expected to!",

            "review_text": "Overall, I recommend it. It's a fun strategy game that can be played either in short bursts on over a long period of time(1+ Hours). In many ways it improves upon the original Ace Patrol, such as more modern planes, new maneuvers, better plane customization, and more detailed maps. But in they totally ruined the feeling of choice the first Ace Patrol had, where you can choose what types of missions you wanted to do, where you did the mission types you liked and avoided the ones you didn't, except for when you were desperate for points to win that Defense/Offense and that mission type you didn't like had bonus points that period.   In both Ace Patrols a campaign consists of alternating between offense and defense, with each offense/defense having 5 battles. Each battle you got to pick between 1-3(1 being the final battle) different mission types. So the whole offense/defense you got to choose your favorites.  In Pacific Skies(this game), It's still a Campaign with 5 alternating Offenses/Defenses and 5 Battles each, but now you can pick your mission type. It just randomly picks one, which BLOWS.  Being able to pick my favorites, or picking my disliked types when I wanted variety was my favorite part. Since enemy Squadrons would rotate pilots between battles, so if the current battle had pilots you didn't like, you can choose a more defensive mission type. But that's gone in this game.  And for some ungodly reason, they removed the full screen option. It was more convenience than anything else, but I see no good reason to remove it since Pacific Skies is basically a retexture of the first game.  Anyway, as a final comment: Unless you hate the planes in the first game or love the planes in this game, just get the fist Ace Patrol, it's better. Though this game is still good too, I guess.",

That being said it's quite entertaining and does have the constant ability to make you think rather than go in all guns blazing. Short and sweet, 4 different campaigns lasting around an hour+ on the easiest difficulty. The more experiance your pilots gain, the more they can do. Various flight manuevers and equipment as well as aircraft become available to you as you progress through air combat. Is it worth 5euro? Sure it is.  ",

            "review_text": "Like with Ace Patrol, I also get asked the same question with this one 'is it worth getting?' so lets do this review.  Short answer really, Is yes if you liked Ace Patrol but want something more with a little punch. It comes with most of the other features of the previous game (randomised pilots you can name that can earn RPG traits and manauvers through experince whilst fighting randomised missions between 1-4 AI pilots using hex combat in a turn based system) and it is especially worth it after playing Ace Patrol.  Pacific Skies takes place the era of warfare where planes have shifted over to faster engines and single wings. Thus the turn based combat is slightly deadlier and quicker than in the prequal game but the aim is still the same (get on their six cover your own). The art assets of course are very very different and much more varied. Both the two American and Japanese factions do dog fighting over land and sea and there are a few new twists added (Instead of Offensives it is now eight famous WW2 battles of the campaign with six missions each to do) like a mission to shoot down a pilot or towers to save one of your crashed pilots from a POW camp. Plane customisation has improved, you can now paint five different part of your squadrons plans with a varied amount of WW2 flight insignia.  While like Ace Patrol there are a few minor once in a blue moon issues with the tiles (I had a mission where an enemy pilot just few into a tile and vanished from the game, assumed crashed) it played a straight up solid indie title like previous game. So in total and in my genuide opinion getting this and the older WW1 themed brother together during a sale will entertaining you for a solid 22 hours in total for a first run on each game.",
