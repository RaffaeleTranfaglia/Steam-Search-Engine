            "review_text": "Terrrible port is terrible.  Running on Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, I suffered from frequent instances of the game suddenly forgetting all of the control bindings, causing the game to be completely uncontrollable -- requiring a close via task manager and a reset of the profile, preventing any progress in the game.  There are also serious problems with audio quality (which is understandable for an Xbox port, really), including on occasion dropped sounds and static interference.  I always wanted to play this game, but never had the chance to do so. Unfortunately, that is still the case.",

            "review_text": "I never thought I'd see an opening splash screen lag so badly. However, when I got to the main menu, I felt a surge of hope the game would actually run better. Everything was going so smoothly, that is, until I went into a mission.    I honestly wouldn't buy this, regardless of how cheap you may find it in future sales. I'm sure it was perfectly fine, if only it ran higher than around 5 fps (and .02 FPS for the splash screen). I cannot reccomend this whatsoever.   DO NOT BUY!  EDIT - I don't have a bad computer, granted its not running a GTX Titan, it should be able to run anything (maybe with lower settings), and well meets the system requirements to run THIS game. At the time, I was using a weaker PC, but it wasn't terrible either. In comparison to other games I was playing at the time, this game looked worse, and had abysmal performance. Anyone questioning my PC should consider that the begging screen (when they show the publisher/dev) shouldn't have been going at such a low frame rate (taking minutes for a 15 - 20 second animation) regardless of my hardware. Even at the lowest setting I could run this at, it the framefrate really tanked. I'll launch it up to see if my current PC does any better, but still, my review stands.",

While readiness continues to be the U.S. Army's top priority, how it goes about its business is changing. Full Spectrum Warrior began as a training aid for the U.S. Army to reinforce Army doctrine and team effort within the troops. It is the most realistic portrayal of Infantry-level urban warfare via unique tactical action gameplay. Players become the Squad Leader, commanding Alpha and Bravo squads. There is potential for danger down every alley, behind every window. Watch those angles folks, we've got a job to do here. Hooah!   - Unique combination of tactical and action gameplay.  - Authentic implementation of U.S. Army Infantry doctrine.  - Simple control scheme lets you command eight soldiers in real time.  - Squad equipment reflects real weaponry and equipment currently in use by the U.S. Army.  - Immersive urban environments with danger around every corner.  - 2-player co-op, each player controls one fire team.  - Includes 2 exclusive bonus levels not available on Xbox.",
