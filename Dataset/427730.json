Badly optimized and numerous glitches prevent playing for more than a couple games at a time.  I know it's a joke game but at least try to keep it playable. Will update this review if the game is patched.  EDIT: So the patch fixed the rematch bug, and the game seems to run smoother overall. Only had a few minutes to play it so I'm not sure if it's entirely 'fixed'.  Review should now be considered a tentative recommendation (But since I can't choose that I'll stick with 'Not Recommended'). If you're looking at reviews chances are you're on the fence, and I still don't think it's quite worth the price of admission unless you already have a friend or two to play with.  tl;dr if you're looking at reviews to make a purchase chances are you can safely pass this game up, it's exactly what the trailers/screenshots look like and if you want that go ahead and buy it, but don't expect anything else.",

Mainly:  - Items no longer drop where mouse is aiming and instead drop at your feet (which makes placing baby gates and putting dangerous items up on shelves next to impossible) - When daddy is able to pick up baby he can then drop it outside map or in walls so it is stuck - Daddy can use the smoke detector battery multiple times to get all powerups immediately (more than ~5 and game crashes) - Cooking for baby chore is broken and instead now grants the powerup that nuke the pills gives - The new animals defecate 2x every time they defecate (which is a lot) which makes it next to impossible to keep away from baby - Pets go through walls to get to you even if you lock them in a room or outside - Baby STILL cannot drown after taking off the inflatable ring (old bug that still hasn't been addressed) - Custom games with more than 2 players often has everybody vanish/disconnect silently (another old bug still unfixed)  I've been waiting a few weeks to see if any of these bugs would be addressed, however there hasn't even been any acknowledgement of the bugs (that I've seen) let alone any fixes. Until this and quite a few other bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed, I would hold off buying to see if the devs are going to commit to fixing these issues or if they are leaving it as is.  Recommendation for devs: Put a pause on adding new features for now and concentrate on fixing bugs.  Also recommend: Have baby/daddy role switch every round when you are paired up with someone from match-making.",

            "review_text": "♥ It isn't hard to run.   This is something I deeply appreciate because though my computer is on the higher end, it can struggle to run games like Minecraft or TF2, and I like to not hear my computer wheezing and coughing like it's going to die.   I'm not sure how it would run on a laptop but I'd imagine it would be fine on a lower end or low graphics computer! : D  ♥ I like how you change roles.  There are some games that I find boring when you're stuck playing as one character or the other for the entire game time. However with Who's Your Daddy, you switch places each round, playing as the baby or the daddy then vice versa. This way it helps to mix up the game play!   ♥ Playing this was so entertaining.  During the short time that I played, it cracked me up to no end. I love how dark the game is yet how amusing it is at the same time. I appreciate games that know not to take themselves seriously. For sure a must play if you're having a bad day or want to have some silly fun with a friend.   ✘ The number one problem with this game is my motion sickness.  When I played with my friend, I felt horrendously sick and have been unable to play it again. This is far from the dev team's fault however I thought to include it in my review for others who suffer from motion sickness. If you do, be warned that this game may be hard on you.   ✘ The graphics could be better.  It doesn't matter that much to me - it's a game to have fun in, not a game to be impressed by the graphics, or spend time staring at how realistic the floor looks. I do think that the baby looks terribly creepy...I'll let him get into the cleaner, LOL.   Of course I'm not serious about that.    ✘ It isn't a game to play with your friend if you aren't going to use your mics.  I played this game while skyping with my friend. If you were going to spend time texting/messaging, there would be no way - you either play the game or chat! By using your mics, you can still chat and have fun.  Overall I absolutely suggest this game for people looking for fun co-op/multiplayer games!!",

First of all, I personally like the music and second of all, it's quite a big update and it was probably rushed from all the people shouting (On the comments) at the developer. There are the problems like the pink screen, which me and my friend don't have. The baby can't win though and the evil tortilla screen lingers for a while with my friends game. It is very fun but i think it needs to have an update that fixes the bugs and incomplete parts of the game. Also you can only spectate as the baby when you die, and i thought it was with family gathering but i think it happened with original. You can't escape either as dad when the baby dies. When i joined a server it would stay on the wierd thing showing the rooms and i couldn't press escape.  So my overall review for this is= It's a great game but it needs to be fixed, I love the graphics because that makes the game what it is, and if the developer fixed them, then it wouldnt be as funny. Please fix this game, though. But i'm not going to rush the dev because he's just released the full game and i imagine that was rushed, Thankyou for reading this.",

            "review_text": "Honestly one of the best games to kill time and laugh till your sides hurt with friends. There are so many things to do:  -Set yourself on fire -Drink bleach (for the memes) -Drink soap -Drown yourself -Eat glass -Freeze yourself -and so much more!  This game is constantly making BIG updates and there is always a surprise when you see it downloading something new! Whether it's new ways to end your miserable baby life, more places to hide after drinking bleach, or even customizing your miserable self before you pass on, this game is always adding fun stuff.  Let's be real, for its price, this game really makes up for it. I'd only recommend that to truly enjoy it to it's fullest, that you play it with a friend.   11/10 Drinking bleach and eating glass with my friends has never been so fun daddy~",

I'm definately looking forward to what comes next. I give this game Four out of Five Stars.

Then the steam release came. It was slightly harder to win as daddy, but still pretty easy if you knew what you were doing. Then an update came. It got slightly easier to win as baby, and harder as daddy. Then another update came. The daddy got some nice features to make it more balanced, and the baby got some more features to make it more unbalanced. Then another update came. The daddy got a helpful item and the baby could teleport. Then another update came. It started to become so unbalanced that if you joined a game and weren't daddy, you would leave with no thaught. Then another update came. The only real way to play became creating rules for your own game such as no forks in outlets. Then another update came.. A few toys were added making it practically impossible to complete the toy mission Then another update came.. It was slightly harder for the daddy to win and slightly easier for the baby Then another update came.. It was slightly harder for the daddy to win and slightly easier for the baby Then another update came... It was slightly harder for the daddy to win and slightly easier for the baby Every update, it's slightly harder for the daddy to win and slightly easier for the baby Every update It is now literally impossible to win as daddy unless you are increadibly experienced and the other player has never played.  Please, don't buy this game now.",
