            "review_text": "Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is an amazing game. My game of the year 2014. Let me explain why.  I have not played a Metal Gear game before, but I jumped on this because I have heard of the acclaim this series has gotten. This may be a spin off of the main series, but it has convinced me enough that I made the right choice in purchasing.   The story is a bit throwaway, but interesting. Hell, I don't care much for it. This game is all about the gameplay. It is a spectacle fighter where you play is Raiden who, to put it quite simply, is a badass. He can slice people in half and into tiny little pieces with the 'Zandatsu' mode aka Blade Mode. This, when used correctly, can slow down time to cut parts of enemies off and even them into half if they are weakened enough. You can also rip out their spine and regain all of your health and blade mode meter. This may seem overpowerd, but it is quite the opposite.  This game is hard. Really hard, even on Normal (Which I recommend you start with). There are also 3 difficulties above it. Yeah. It gets really intense and requires a lot of skill. You will need to parry foes by attacking in the same direction as them and dodge them by unlocking a skill known as 'Defensive Offensive' and using at the perfect timings. If you are skilled enough, you can perfect parry your opponents to do serious damage. On the hardest difficulty, Revengeance, this is required. Every single enemy on that difficulty will take serious damage from it or get sliced into pieces. I found revengeance to be a nice change of pace. I even found it easier, but maybe it is because I got real good at it.  The boss fights are one of the best parts of the game. They are all extremely hard and they even have a no damage achievement to go with it. Prepare to spend hours and hours trying to beat them, but having that proper satisfaction and success when you finally memorize their movements and parrying their every move. The bosses are also incredibly unique and each require very different strategies to beat.  The game has an upgrade system where you can unlock skins, new weapons and upgrades for them. There is quite a lot of stuff to upgrade, and some of them are tied to the many collectibles, which are quite well hidden. You can get the currency, BP, by ripping out the spine of your foes, by completing battles or finding consumables. These consumables consist of one time use items, like Grenades, RPG's and Stealth items. This game has a very simple stealth system (Approach enemy from behind/above. press button) but going head first into fights is where this game is at it's best.  All of the DLC is included. This includes extra skins, weapons, 2 bonus campaigns and VR Missions, which is basically the games challenge mode. There are 20 of these missions in the base game and 30 in the dlc. They are all really hard and sometimes frustrating, but it is always satisfying to finally completing a hard challenge. Some of the DLC ones also offer a different type of gameplay. There is a very obvious nod to a sidescroller in one of them.  The bonus campaings are really good as well. They offer a different playable character, more collectables and more challenging fights. Jetstream Sam is a much heavier fighter, while Blade Wolf is more stealth focused. They both offer a change of pace and more replay value, which the base game has a lot of.  One final thing I should mention. The Music. It is f*cking amazing. Not only do they sound brilliant, the lyrics have a meaning to the boss fights, which is where most of them are found. It has, hands down, one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.  Final Verdict: 10/10. Buy it now. £4, £10, £20, it is all worth your hard earned money. I really hope a sequel is made, as the game was quite short, but it offers a extreme amount of replay value.",

I bought the game for Xbox 360 and ps3 and Now its availeble on pc  a dream came true Metal Gear Rising is not Metal gear SOLID  of course it is in the Metal gear universe but its not Tactical Espionage stuff its Lightning Bolt action! Everyone knows Raiden 'not me' The wimpy whiny fella who became that cyborg? Now its your turn to slash, decapitate, and did i already said slash?! your way through almost everything this game has one of the best soundtracks in my opinion and it has a HIGH replayability since u can unlock stuff. the only negative thing is maybe the the fighting 'blade mode or zandatzu' its a-bit 'dull' as i would say Blade mode is Raiden´s Glorious time slowing Bolt action Precision mode, where you can slash enemy´s in tiny tiny pieces or big. YOUR CHOICE HERE!  i give this game a 9,5/10  would recommend this game  ",

            "review_text": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I am attempting to review this game purely as an over-the-top action game. I'm not necessarily reviewing this as a Metal Gear title, because I don't think it performed well within the scope of the franchise, of which I am a long-time fan.    + Partially destructable environments + Parrying system is extremely fun, particularly 'blade free' attacks + Soundtrack is great for the type of game it is, and is very well-timed; not necessarily the kind of music I would listen to, but it gets you pumped during boss fights, so I consider it a plus + Game was very well-optimized, and looked great at max settings + Character and load-out customization is very fulfilling and practical + Included one of the most hilariously over-the-top final bosses of all time; absolutely ridiculous, but enormously entertaining if you choose not to take it seriously  - Poor mouth animations - Lazy storytelling; supporting characters will fill in background info on the game world, telling protagonist things he should already know in great detail (I know this has been done before in previous entries of the series, but in this game it's just SO BAD) - Overly campy dialogue - Sub-par voice-acting (particularly Raiden's 'Jack the Ripper' voice) - Supporting characters and antagonists were entirely forgettable - Camera didn't follow the action as effectively as the pace of the fighting warranted, and could lead to some unnecessary blunders throughout the game   If you enjoyed this review, please follow my  curator page .

            "review_text": "A wonderful game, simple as that.   I only played the very first Metal Gear Solid on PSX about 150 years ago and otherwise prefer FPS and action based RPG games.  But then this game simply caught me. A lovely art style with nice voices and the story is, well not very new, but still good and i really enjoyed it. Yet the best about this game is the packing action, the responsive gameplay and the increased challenge of the higher difficulties that throws actually harder enemies in terms of 'more capable' at you instead of just boosting them with bigger health bars. Fighting a basic cyborg at higher difficulties is simply not compareable to fighting them on lower difficulties, they block, they counter, they use strong attacks, they knock you out if you dont watch out. Learn to parry and you will survive, that should be rule #1. All that combined with the music this game offers gives you a huge replayability and makes the time you spend playing worthy.  But there are however bugs, nobody can deny that. However in my about 30 hours of ingame gameplay i only encountered a somewhat irritating and annoying camera angle change in very rare locations where it spins outwards.  = Summary Pro + nice art style + responsive action based gameplay + good story + wonderful music + nice difficulty scaling Contra - sometimes annoying camera changes",

            "review_text": "Hands down one of the best ways a canon Metal Gear spinoff game could've been handled. Filled with explosive action (and actual explosive action), gripping boss fight designs, and an amazing original soundtrack composed for each stage of the game to fit the theme that'll expresses the story behind it.  Developed by Platinum Games, the home of the 'extreme combat hack 'n slash' genre brings a new element to the sub-genre, with precision cutting to cripple or incapitate foes. But that doesn't mean the other areas are left with less focus, still holding true to its spiritual predecessors and its roots, it retains its fast-paced combat, over-the-top boss fights, and even the surprising option to the genre to reward stealth manuevers or no-kill combat.   Though that doesn't mean the game is without some flaws of its own, things that I unfortunately am not fond of are:  Linear level design, while there are some different paths to go for possible stealth segments, they are very obvious when and when they don't want you to try sneak past your foes. Its a nice option, but its a limited option that is merely there for its previous roots. Its also a really bad idea to cut everything in the environment sometimes, its fun, but you could've parkour'd over it to find goodies, or use it to hide.  Limited resolution options, I am unable to play the game in my native resolution of 1600x900 and was only able to play it at 1366x768. While it didn't impede my experience by much, it might have a more negative impact for people wanting to play at a much higher resolution.  Locked 60 FPS, while I understand that the speed of the game is tied to the FPS, it takes a ridiculous dump when there's too much happening on the screen at once, or you're cutting something into pieces a bit too much. There isn't much of a fix, the only advice I can give you is that if you've already cut it into something smaller than mincemeat, STOP, HE'S ALREADY DEAD, JUST STOP. Its fun to see how many pieces you can cut them into, but know when to draw the line!  This is a clear console port, while it doesn't mean that you should avoid it like the plague, its designed to be played with the controller. You're punishing yourself if you decide to play this on a mouse and keyboard, go get a controller.  Its a short experience, about only 6-7 hours long tops with the base game campaign, but the PC edition bundled it with the two DLC stories and VR mission pack that extends its playtime a little more than the base game would have had. It doesn't mean it suffers replayability issues, in fact, it has plenty of replayability if you wish to tackle it at a higher difficulty, or with Raiden a little bit more fleshed and loaded out.    While MGR is not written by the infamously confusing and perplexing Hideo Kojima, the story works wonders in blending in with the MG universe to be equally confusing, but an enthralling experience and should definitely be something to consider, even if you aren't a Metal Gear veteran.",

It's the first boss, and it only gets better from here. The combat is very fast-paced and rewarding, though the parry system is hard to get used to. Something that I must mention is the absolutely  BADASȘ  soundtrack. I don't recall any songs from MGR that I disliked, and the final boss wouldn't be half as awesome without his theme.  You will not regret playing this game. And if you have a console, consider the PC version anyway, it plays very smoothly and has DLC integrated from the start.",

Well, that's because it is a good game, a fantastic game actually, I just don't really think it met my expectations. See, Metal Gear Rising: Revengence was first annouced as Metal Gear Solid: Rising and was honestly a much better looking game, but aparently Hideo Kojima was frustrated with the lack of experience of his younger staff who he handed the game to and was didn't want too/was too busy to direct it himself so it was given to Plantnum Games. Platnum retooled the game from the hybrid stealth game to a hack and slash action game with a cutting gimmick.   This would all be well and good had they not completely wrecked Raiden's character arc and put some absolutely awful writting in a series known for good writting. It doesn't make sense that Raiden is in this game at this point in the timeline as it completely ignores his character development in Metal Gear Solid 4. It doesn't help that no one from any previous game other than Raiden and one other character appear despite Raiden being married and having a kid and the other charcter living with the two main characters from previous games. Honestly, I'm probably just being an idiot about this though. The game is a stupid action movie that revels in being over the top and really dumb while pretending to wax philosophical like the rest of them. It would be good for a laugh if I weren't so invested in the series.  Beyond that the music is good...In the game. Outside of the context of the game however, it is generic buttrock that is actually offensive to the ears. That said, everyone knows how cool it is to cut a giant robot to pieces while said generic buttrock is playing. It works with the style they were going for.  The gameplay is deeply rewarding, if a little simple. It is the textbook definition of hard to learn, easy to master. The game does a very poor job of explaining its mechanics, but once you've got the timing down, it is actually very hard to die, or even take damage as you will be blocking or dodging nearly every attack thrown at you. It is very fast paced and exciting though, even once you have mastered it there is a metric ton of tension in the final boss fight as he can kill you very quickly if you aren't perfect. There is also stealth technically, but it really isn't worth talking about.  I played this on xbox before and was surprised at how well it made the transition to PC. I actually think I prefer the mouse and keyboard for this game as it makes blocking a little easier. The port is very good is what I am saying.  So yeah, the game is good. It is stupid fun and great for a laugh. Long time fans may appriciate the subtle gags and nods, others will see it as a great parody, and the small minority of hate-blinded fanboys who take the game way to seriously (like myself) will be upset. For everyone else, you are in for a wild ride, this game is great.",

The graphics, sadly, feel 'dated' (actually, the textures and SOME models feel like that) but the cutscenes are amazing.  It's a game that requires patience too, since it can be hard as hell in some of the fights.  If you like Metal Gear, over the top action, and the Hack 'n Slash genre, you'll LOVE this game.

            "review_text": "Kojipro and Platinum Games bring the CUHRAZYness to the Metal Gear universe in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Set after MGS4, you play as Raiden, tasked with bringing down a PMC by the name of Desperado. The story is pretty standard action game fare, although it's neat to get a glimpse of the MG world post-patriots.   The gameplay is where the meat of the game is at, however. While not as deep as DMC(the good ones) and Ninja Gaiden, the gameplay in MGR is more than adequate and will entertain fans of the genre and newcomers alike. There are weapons, bodies, and skills you can purchase with BP, gained from killing your enemies. There are VR missions to test your skills and unlock new bodies for Raiden. You also aquire sub-weapons from killing certain bosses, however equipping them takes away the use of your strong attack button. This, combined with the fact that they are largely only useful in specific situations makes them much less appealing than just sticking with your main sword. Another gripe I have is the lack of enemy variety. However, the game's biggest draw is 'Blade Mode', where you slow down time and are able to cut in any direction. This is used to cut enemies into pieces and attack bosses weak points, and is very well done. The game itself is a bit short, even for a game of this genre, but has many reasons to replay it.  Lastly, the oft-praised soundtrack deserves a special mention. The music is very well done and fits the game perfectly. When fighting most bosses, the lyrics of the song are from the bosses point of view which is a neat little touch. The OST does its job and really gets you hyped up for the fights, especially the last boss.   All in all, despite a few minor flaws, MGR is well worth the asking price and will hopefully be a fixture in the action game scene for years to come. ",

            "review_text": "This game was way more fun than it had any right being.  Metal Gear as a whole is a terrible series written by an autistic weirdo. Its plot is a mishmash of B-list animes trying to pass themselves off as a straight spy story with poignant real world commentary with ridiculous 40 minute cutscenes. The fact that the series has any success at all is a testament to the fact that the world is populated by absolute cretins.   But Revengeance is different. It sheds the long cutscenes and metaphysical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in favour of a straightforward plot with ninja cyborgs fighting each other. Gone is Kojima's vomit and in its place is a straightforward sword-wielding hero who's out to slice and dice everything in his path. Because the story goes easy on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff with AIs, clones and vampires, it actually is possible to enjoy it rather than simply wish you could punch Kojima in the mouth.  The gameplay meanwhile is superb. Parrys flow into combos, which flow into dodges, jumps and then more combos. Unlike other games of this type, using a long combo isn't just a ticket to getting hit and humiliated. When you shift into blade mode, which lets you slice the enemy apart, it gets really satisfying. The boss battles are intense, but with the exception of one stupid half fight with a guy that has boards to hide behind, they're all fair and play by the rules. No dumb gimmick 'switch controllers' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that that idiot Kojima usually does.   Just goes to show that even something like Metal Gear can be great in the right hands, as opposed to the hands of a drooling idiot like Kojima.",

The “Zandatsu” system, in which you cut open your cyborg enemies exactly how you want and pull out their electrolytes, refills your health instantly. This lets you wade in deep, and if you’re good, stay alive no matter what.   Once the dust settles and everyone around you is reduced to meaty chunks, there’s the plot.

Rising does not take itself seriously, so I wouldn’t recommend anyone playing it does either.

If you're looking for a hack-and-slash game with non-stop action during the gameplay, this is the game for you. It's what every little kid inside us wants; big robots, explosions, a badass protagonist to look up to and so on. All of that combined with very solid gameplay and an alright story made for an awesome experience. I had a great time all the way through. The combat is very fast-paced, and it has a rather unique game mechanic; Blade Mode. This allows you to slow down time and get free control on where you slash at enemies, so you can dismember and decapitate them, or even cut them in a specific spot to expose their fuel cell so you can rip that out and use it to restore your health. You get rewarded BP for how well you do during each fight, and at the end of a chapter depending on the rank you got. This BP can be spent on new moves or weapon, health and fuel upgrades.   I'm making it sound like the only way to play this game is to just run into every battle and slash your way through it. But you don't have to play the game like this. Quite a lot of areas in this game can be stealthed if you're careful and do assassinations on all the enemies, but I hardly ever bothered because I really like combat. There are also some easter eggs, hidden jokes and secret areas, which did make it feel a bit more like an MGS game. You can even hide in a box or drum can, as a stab to those games.  The plot wasn't anything special though, especially if you've played the previous MGS games. But the cutscenes still had the same quality in cinematography and storytelling as those games did, although these were considerably shorter. I personally did like the plot, but that was mainly because it featured Raiden, who I've always thought was really badass. And this game is the epitome of his awesomeness, so I was still satisfied with the plot of this game.  I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes action and the Hack-and-Slash genre. I'm not going to recommend this game for its plot, because it's just alright and not up to par with the MGS games. It's still there and it can be enjoyed, but it's far from the best things this game has to offer.",

I think it was a week after its release that I got to see a let's play video somewhere on youtube - involving the last boss of the game (because I hardly cared about spoilers back at the time.) What I saw… kind of bought me.  Getting to play this game was one of the best decisions I’ve made in my whole life.  It definitely doesn’t offer the same kind of experience as the old MGS games do. And you know what? That’s fine. You can feel that MGR is still a Kojima game - with its specific humor, lovely easter eggs and the kind of story-telling that I adore.  But the absolute best part of this game? The boss fights combined with a gorgeous soundtrack that make you feel like you’re in some kind of amazing GMV. I adore the fact that the music starts playing with lyrics when you’re doing great in a fight, and that is becomes only instrumental when you’re getting hit instead, and that it becomes well-timed with with the in-fight cutscenes - it’s a nice touch I haven’t seen in any other game that I’ve played before. It’s a small detail that makes you smile and does amazing things to the overall experience.  I’m not sure how it happened, but this title actually became my favorite game from the series. I finished it 6 times on my X360, and I’m going to continue playing it here, on Steam. I think that alone says enough.  TL;DR: Just let it rip, let rules of nature guide you and remember that you’re ♥♥♥♥ing invincible because of nanomachines, son. 10/10, would Zandatsu everyone again.",

You will be busy for a while with this one if you're a completionist. Platinum did good work on this one.   PROS  -Solid Controls -Fun Gameplay -Decent (Albeit sometimes Cheesy) Story -Lots of Replay Value -Unlockables -Multiple Difficulty Levels   CONS  -Short Campaign  -QTE Cutscenes   STORY   You play as Raiden from the MGS series (If you're not familiar with MGS don't worry. No MGS knowledge is required to play this game) who's been decked out in cybernetics &amp; is basically a killing machine. You start out protecting some country's leader &amp; end up being ambushed by several Cyborg Assassin's who are much more powrful than you. In the end, you lose an arm &amp; an eye as well as your contract. Later, you find Raiden flying a plane sent to infiltrate the country again &amp; seize it's current Dictator who's taken control but later find out there's some huge conspiracy involving kidnapped children, cybernetic soldiers, &amp; a US Senator. I mean, what kind of story would it be if there wasn't some greedy stereotypical warmongering republican politician involved? Sarcasm aside, it ends up working rather well &amp; the final showdown with the last boss is something that you probably won't see coming &amp; is executed rather brilliantly. The campaign is short, however &amp; can be beaten in one sitting if playing on easy. I recommend you play on Normal difficulty on your first playthrough unless you want a bigger challenge.   The game is also full of optional dialog in the main menu which is accessed simply by calling the person you want to talk to. They give you lore about the area, enemies &amp; sometimes just talk about nonsense like what they want to eat later. The characters are very well done for how they're shown considering they're shown most of the time on video phones.   GAMEPLAY   Raiden has a variety of moves at his disposal, but the majority of them you will need to purchase with BP that is earned from playing the game. Some key moves are required to have an easier time playing the game such as Defensive Offense which is a dodge. Every boss you beat also earns you a new weapon all of which have their uses but I found the polearm the most useful in tight situations. It hits the fastest, has the longest reach &amp; is good if you are surrounded. The Psyonic Psy's are good for getting close to an enemy, but that's about it. And the giant hedge clippers are good for fighting big/slow enemies. You also can unlock a variety of costumes some of which give bonuses like extra medkits, grenades, or rocket launchers. Then there are the swords which take more time to unlock since unlocking them involves finding collectables, left arms, &amp; box people (except for one which is part of the main story &amp; the Fox Blade which is really expensive &amp; overpowered). Every weapon can be upgraded as well &amp; upgrading a weapon 100% will cost you a hefty amount of BP. There are also Wigs which are unlocked by collecting ID's &amp; having a certain amount after you beat the story will unlock a specific wig. Some wigs are only unlocked on higher difficulties. The wig bonuses are OP &amp; can be considered game breaking buffs but they're obviously there for fun. The game also has hidden unlockables throughout the levels such as Health/Energy upgrades &amp; VR missions which can be played at any time.  The boss fights in this game are very fun &amp; challenging. The only part about them that I don't like is nearly every boss has some sort of instant kill cutscene which if you fail you will die. There are a lot of QTE cutscenes in the game that are annoying besides the boss ones. This is probably my only major complaint with the game.   The game also has Blade Mode which is activated by holding the L-Trigger. In this mode you can find enemy weakspots &amp; cut them as well as other objects to shreds so long as you have the energy to maintain it. Later on in the game's story you unlock Ripper Mode which enhances all your abilities including Blade mode. On higher difficulties Ripper Mode is pretty much a requirement in order to complete the game.   AUDIO   The music is probably the best part about this game. It's put together in such a way where it feels perfect for the situation at hand, during boss fights especially. The sound effects are also very well done. The clanging of blades &amp; swishing of swords as you cut through enemies &amp; objects feels just right.    OVERALL   This game is probably one of the best hack &amp; slash games I've ever played. Everything about it is set up in such a way to just be fun, exhilerating &amp; high octane action. This is one of those games that you will probably come back to every now and then long after you've beaten it just because of how much it actually offers even in it's small package. There's so much to unlock if you're a completionist &amp; the Very Hard or Revengeance difficulties will have you pulling your hair out trying to beat them. Good thing the game gives you wigs! Well worth it if on a good sale.",

Surprisingly better than Devil May Cry: Devil May Cry, with a far less stupid name and annoying protagonist. The game is best played in hard mode and there are more difficulty levels unlocked as you beat the game. Character progression is in the form of upgrades for your weapons and character move sets. There is stealth, and you can easily play through some segments completely stealthy, but I haven't.  I honestly don't know what more to say about this game. It's great fun, hugely enjoyable to listen to, and the boss battles set the standard for the action genre. Also, the final boss battle is incredible. Don't skip the movie sequences. Easily best villain ever.",

If you take the game seriously you're doing it wrong. This is the kind of game you play for an hour or so, getting super hyped by the fast pace, fancy particles, and high-octane music, and then come back to after you've calmed down a bit. Speaking of the music, the soundtrack fits very well and really gets the hype going while you're slicing things to smithereens. The final boss fight is a bit BS if you're playing with keyboard+mouse, though, in my experience.  I'm guessing some hardcore MGS fans won't enjoy the game too much, because if they're expecting a game like the MGS games, they will be sorely disappointed.

These cyborgs and mechs just look awesome. The game is very fast and you'll come to visit many different countries. The story is ok and the fight-system is smooth and appealing.  On the other side all environments look pretty much the same. There are no special missions and you're doing pretty much the same all the time. The sequences where you should be the silent assassins are dumb (hiding under cardboxes and barrels) and fighting will always work out too.  The most annoying thing about this game is the 'block &amp; parry system', which - in my case - never worked as I wanted it to be. I know that you have to block (press attack) a second after the enemies eyes flash red, while pushing the analog-stick in die right direction. I suppose the XBox-360-Controller is not exact enough, but it only worked in 25% of the incoming attacks. The developers should have implemented a better system here, in order of having me fully satisfied.  The boss-fights could have been very interesting, but especially the last one (including a very very very very long and boring dialog) is dull and uninspired. The dialogues in particular are too long. After a while - despite my usual playstyle of seeing and experiencing everything there is within a game - I also did not pursued the optional radiomessages from your teammembers.  All in all I would give this game a 6,5 out of 10. It depends a) on wether or not you can master the blocking-system, b) you like the eastern style and dialogs and c) the prize you've paid for this game (cost/effiency).",

Come to think of it, Why is that underwhelming? This game isn't a reboot or a remake! The usual Metal Gear Solid will still be made with the their classic stealth mechanic so... Why complain about how this game isn't fully based on stealth?  Anyway, I'm getting offtrack, This game is a Hack 'n Slash (Or in other words, a Beat 'em Up with swords) where you play as Raiden... Who I honestly don't know what was his portrayment in the original saga, but I must admit, after playing the game, this game obtained my approval, I like this character, However, the plot in the game is... confusing... Never the less, I'd still say it's a good plot, not one of the best you've ever seen, but at least it bring us something entertaining unlike other games who just throw us the first thing they got in mind, oh! And I really have to mention the soundtrack! It's awesome!! Comepletly, over all the tracks from the bosses, They give us some great rock you just can't stop hearing.  Now to the gameplay itself, it's actually being a long time since I enjoyed a Beat 'em... Ahem... I mean, a Hack 'n Slash game like this (Seriously? Why have two names for two genres of games that are basically the same thing?) the controls feel good althought you're gonna have a lot of trouble with the fact that attacking and parring are in the same freaking button! At first that simply annoys you, but after playing it I must say, I think it kind of made the game better, it gave it challenge, and it's not that hard to differenciate one action from the other, the game also has the blade mode, where time goes slower and you remain still to give a lot of cuts to the enemies that tear them to pieces, it's pretty fun cutting somebody in over five hundred shreds, you should try that out!  In the end, a great game! I comepletly recomend it to everyone! To Beat 'em up fans at least!... I mean... Hack 'n slash fans.... Seriously! Why the different names!?",
