            "review_text": "  A really great classic-style platformer, but with WAY more content and features than most. I especially love the new VR functionality! It really makes the beautiful environments come alive. I know the VR implementation is still a little bit of a work in progress, with a little more to be done for things like cutscenes and UI, but it's already really great, and definitely worth enabling and playing the game in this mode. There aren't enough VR platformers out there yet, if you ask me (Luckey's Tale being one of the only ones), and this is a great addition.",
