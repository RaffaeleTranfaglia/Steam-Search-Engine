The only reason you should buy or play this version of the game is for the mods that were built for this and not Warband. The most notable being Star Wars: Conquest, which is a total conversion mod for the game that takes the core gameplay elements and replaces the story, setting, characters, mythos, universe, etc with faithful Star Wars content. That mod is what would make me recommend this to people. If you're a fan of Star Wars you NEED to play Star Wars: Conquest, and the only way to do so is with this base game.",

That said, this game is fantastic and I enjoyed every minute of the 300 hours I spent playing it. I would give it a 9 for 10 (there are flaws in it, after all).

Someone who has played Warband, and is wondering if this game is worth getting  If you've just now found the game on steam and haven't played Warband, I'd recommend buying Warband instead. It's a bit more expensive, but all in all it's a more polished game with some nice new mechanics that doesn't exist in this game.  If you've played Warband alot, and really like it, I recommend buying this game. Sure, the gameplay is a bit worse than Warband, so if you want to play Native, I'd just recommend Warband. So why do I recommend it? Mods. Soooo many mods...  So, if it's on sale, I'd recommend you getting it, seeing as how many mods there are here that will never come to Warband. If you haven't played Mount &amp; Blade and don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about mods, just buy Warband.  I'll give it a positive, even though it's a bit of both negative and positive depending on who you are.",

This game is what every Strategy/RPG hybrid should look up to. Mount and Blade has a lot of replayability, as akin to its descendant Mount and Blade Warband. The gameplay is great, fun and rewarding. Altough the actual combat is rather clunky in terms of animations, the game is very well developed. All the Mount and Blade series needs now is a game that has a multiplayer/co-op overhead map gamemode (Mount and Blade Bannerlord, I'm looking at you.). Mount and Blade is a really good game, I would recommend it to anyone who is skeptical about genre hybrids. 8/10",

I really enjoyed how you get to choose your side because in most games they just put you on whatever side they want. You also get the customisation of your army. You choose who you recruit and choose they're classes for them as they go up so you can enjoy the game better. Also some special units you can find in taverns with actual names like Jeremus, Devachi and alot more. The special units start off with they're base skills but you can change them as they level up and with these special units you can choose they're gear. I got this at the summer picnic sale for 2.79 and after me playing Mount and Blade, i may consider getting Mount and Blade: Warband.",

            "review_text": "Overall: so much fun! You get a great combination of action in the medieval combat, strategy in the larger scale battles, and role-playing game classics such as choosing alliances and missions, leveling up, and suiting up.  With that said, the role-playing aspect couldn't be considered truly complete on its own. Your personal relationships with lords, for instance, does indeed evolve somewhat and have an impact on the options available to you, but the relationship mechanisms in place are a little shallow. This part of the game sort of comes across as a roleplaying sandbox and only a stick to dig with.   Combat and looting also suffer some issues, but overall the combat system is pretty satisfying (though you'll see what I'm talking about when you're trying to pick up weapons in the tournaments). A variety of fairly viable combat styles are available to your character, though you'll usually have to adapt to the context of the battle.   Speaking of the battle contexts, you're offered a number of different scenarios, from open battles on the field to raiding throne rooms to laying siege to cities or castles. You can thus get a nice taste sword and shield battle atop a wall as well hit-and-run with mounted archery in the field.   These styles and contexts also flow nicely out of the nature of your army and their background, with the Khergit, Swadians, Rhodoks, Vaegirs, and Nords differing significantly in their typical strategies. For many people that enjoy these games, the tactics surrounding match ups between these factions is the heart of what makes the game unique.  Anyway, overall awesome. I look forward to trying the Warband expansion where some things will be fixed and some content will be added.",

            "review_text": "Best combat on horse or foot that I've played so far. Realistic combat mechanics,  both on foot and mounted; the game's strong point is a simulation of combat on  horseback.  Visually impressive even though this game is already a few years old. The environment rendering like the dynamic lighting of day and night cycles and occasional weather effects like fog or rain are convincing. Graphic details are very much customizable.  Game is very flexible and non-linear; you are free to do as you please; stay neutral or pick sides, hunt bandits or do quests, in any order and at your own pace. Issue tactical commands during 1st person battle or strategic commands on the world map. Strategic commands are only available after joining a faction and after being elected as the marshal.  Use your marshal appointment to mobilize a huge battalion and engage on a war path OR NOT. NPC AI in battle and pathfinding is adequate. If the lords are not mobilized, they will most likely patrol or do their own thing; they may also occasionally attempt to besige a castle but they will not coordinate with other lords unless you're not the marshal but just one of the house lords, in which case, another marshall will coordinate the army. So if you don't want the game to end so soon, don't coordinate a castle siege.  Though character class is non-existent, role-playing elements are quite extensive.  Distribute attributes &amp; skill points to your preferred style of play. Weapon proficiency increases through usage. Neither magic nor alchemy is needed here; the setting of this game is medieval fiction rather than mythological fantasy but it has enough interesting elements, depth of gameplay &amp; replayability to draw you back and try something new.  Ahh, before I end this lengthy justification of a recommendation, I do have a few gripes about M&amp;B, albeit minor ones. One is that morale of the party gradually goes down over time; the bigger the party the faster it declines and morale only gets a major boost after a major battle is won, this makes it virtually imperative to look for trouble to keep the troops happy even though they are always paid on time and adequately supplied with a variety of food types. If the troops do not get their fix of adrenaline they may eventually desert your party. Luckily bandits roam about all the time, you just have to be fast enough to nail them. As you might have guessed by now, the other thing is that troop maintenance is high, so you got to constantly fight in tournaments, look for quests, sell loot, sell prisoners to the slave market, or collect taxes but by far the most lucrative way of earning money is placing bets in the tournaments, looting enemy villages or extorting from enemy caravans. No rest for the weary.  Despite its aggravating tendencies, this game does integrates aspects of role-play, strategy, action and simulation equally well in a neat polished package and this kind of inclusive gameplay I have not seen nor played before, hence my recommendation.",

The choices in this game are many from making your own empire to helping an already existing faction take over or just hop around each faction being a mercenary. The gameplay is easy to understand and fun and the added need of strategy in some battles makes the game that much more fun. However, the graphics as well as customization are to be desired as character customization is quite rough and very few options exists for facial hair, hair color, hair styles, and overall facial features. The graphics are there but look rough and edgy making the game hard to really appreciate it's true beauty. This game also boast an impressive skill set allowing for you to spec into many different weapons as well as skills and attributes.

'Heroes' in you army can be levelled up, like you, and you can purchase new gear or just use the loot from your kills.

The castle sieges involve one or two ladders and no seige equipment. The various factions are designed off real world empires and all the weapons are High Middle Ages Chivalric equipment. Some Stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ got all butthurt so I am making sure I explain why this title is past its life. This game was a good start, but the developers get better each game. Mount &amp; Blade Bannerlord is out this year... although they seem to be getting the hots for the weapon and army look of the late Dark Ages and that ♥♥♥♥ is getting annoying. Your call.

They are all amazing but just get warband if you aren't making a collection or something like that.  GET THIS DAMN WORK OF ART!(M&amp;B WARBAND)",

The sence of satisfaction gained from nailing someone with a Bow &amp; Arrow from horseback, at 300m whilst charging through a forest is similar to that of any fps shooter... if not more so because its such a change from the norm.  Also well recommended for anyone who, like me, spends too much time reading tolkien-esque books.",

You may join any faction (or none of them). You can have alliances with everyone (or noone). You can be a common foot soldier, a supreme commander of your army or you can be a one-man-army-killer-machine dude.   Whatever you want! The sieges can get a little bland after some time (they could use a little more diversity), but that comes in the next parts.   I absolute recommend this game to everyone, especialy to people who like strategy middle-ages warfare.",
