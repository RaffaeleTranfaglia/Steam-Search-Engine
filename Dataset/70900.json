BUT - it does seem like this game is getting robbed by a sequel - the game description claims that features are 'currently' being expanded... but to all appearances its NOT, its just the old sales pitch, while the expanded feature development is implemented in a new game (sequel). Does 'seem' a little dishonest... . If this changes, I'll change my review.",

            "review_text": "Superb 3D space RTS. Like the civilization games if they were massize 3D space RTS with no size limits or unit caps. This game delivers a true 3D universe (with the option to flatten it to a 2D pane if that's the kind of map you want) with real time flight between stars and clusters. Sins of a Solar Empire meets Sid Meier's Civilization with extras that both games lack like 3D spaceflight along individually determined paths, real time civil management and custom unit construction.  Really a lovely game, proud to have it in my library. A recommended collectors item to buy on sale or even off if you have the spare cash and would appreciate sitting down to play something like this singleplayer sometime.  Unfortunately multiplayer is fairly dead and with Star Ruler 2 available for purchase now likely to stay that way. Still a very nice game for even just a few 100 hours of singleplayer. Star Ruler 2 going to be even better I hope and with people online.  This is the sort of thing I think of when I think of a honestly priced classic high quality PC video game.  A shame it hasn't been much more popular. Hopefully that would not ruin it as it seems to have much of the industry.",

If you like having the ability to customize your ships in Galactic Civ II or something along those lines then this is the next step up. There (were) also some excellent mods, at least two total conversion mods that added tons of weapons and the like but unfortunately those have become outdated. I hear, however, that the modding is easy (relatively) so that is another plus if you like messing around with your games.  Unfortunately, it does have some problems though. I am not 100% certain the weapons are all balanced and the diplomacy system is... lacking.. to say the least, but I still very much enjoy playing and still do.  If you liked this game, you should check out the sequel they are working on!",

I has it's moments, let there be no doubt, but overall there's a bunch of things that I don't like about it. I'll say pass on this unless you are really hard up or significant updates are made.  My Score: 5/10  *Note: Have not played significantly since major updates and patches came out. This will get rereviewed once I have time to sink into this game.",

            "review_text": "Let me tell you a story.  The Terran Empire had been expanding for thousands of years, and met an empire that surpassed even theirs. With nearly every planet colonized, it was only a matter of time until a war for galactic domination ensued. The Terran Empire had one advantage: They had developed advanced jump drives that let them move their ships anywhere in the galaxy within seconds. When war was declared, massive alien fleets steamrolled through every system, each fleet equivalent to the entire Terran navy. The Terrans, using their strategic maneuverability edge, worked to group their whole navy up, and destroy each steamrolling enemy fleet one at a time. That was the plan. However, significant losses after the first battle made the Terran fleet unable to do more than token resistance as their race was exterminated.  So, I reloaded the save.  This time, at war's declaration, the Terrans sacrificed all their systems along their borders, and split up their fleet into dozens of small strike forces. Jumping them all deep all over the enemy empire, they caused havoc, able to destroy multiple systems each in the time it took the steamrollers to take out one. A war of strategic attrition ensued, as it was a race to see who could conquer the other faster in order to gain the technological and economic edge. The tide of battle started to turn in the Terrans favor. A critical system lay in the path of the enemy: A shipyard system, powered by the resources of a hundred worlds, frantically pushing out huge state of the art warships. The system was switched over to defenses, and soon became a fortress bristling with artillery. As the enemy arrived, they were met with fierce railgun and artillery fire, but they pushed in. fleets were scrambled from around the galaxy and hundreds of ships arrived, firing salvoes as they jumped in, and the enemy fleet was vanquished. From then on, the Terrans struck where they chose, and destroyed fleet after enemy fleet, until the galaxy was theirs.  Sound epic? This was my afternoon. Star Ruler is an amazingly rewarding game, where basically anything you can think of can be done with the simple ship creation and AI tools. Huge mining carrier ships producing fleets on their own? check. stick engines and guns on planets and fly them around? check. Create a ship literally the size of the galaxy? check.  Downsides: There are a few reasons why Star Ruler isn't the best game ever. 1) Because there are no galaxy size or ship size or fleet size caps, you can have literally thousands of ships. This requires a powerful computer. For many people this isn't a problem, but it may be for you. 2) The game is basically all macro and very little micro. It doesn't matter so much how your fleets tactically engage the enemy, so much as how many fleets you have and where they are strategically. Again, if you're just looking for macro gameplay, this isn't an issue. 3) The diplomacy is shallow at best, just serving as 'the thing that is happening when you aren't at war'. If you're playing star ruler you're probably not looking for diplomacy however, so this is probably negligible.",
