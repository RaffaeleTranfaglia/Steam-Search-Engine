The story itself wasn't the greatest but that didn't bother to much as I more enjoyed doing the challenge levels on the harder difficulties.  Overall I'd say if you're a fan of tower defences give it a try",

Fun little game! Unfortunately, it constantly crashes - had to restart a stage like five times - I want to play the game, therefore am keeping it, yet cannot recommend at present time...",

Daily login bonus, ect... As a mobile game I would not recommend this game.  As for the PC version, I for sure recommend the game. You will get to points that you have to grind to level your characters and your towers, but I actually found it fun doing so. I have not fully beat the game yet, only two levels left, but the challenge is amazing and I am really enjoying the game.  Probably one of the best tower defense games with RPG elements on Steam.",

            "review_text": "Mobile port.   Better get some of the many free TD games in your Appstore, this is not worth 3â‚¬ for me.  Graphics are designed for mobile phones, sounds &amp; music are not overwhelming aswell. I caught myself getting really impatient, hitting the fastfoward button as soon as possible. And i always expected some PayToWin buttons to pop up and beg for me to buy some gems or crystals...  I did not play enough to hit the sure to be expected mobile paywall, but it is not very inspired or difficult enough for staying longer. The first 6 levels can be played without even placing a tower, if you manage to get your hero to the right position.  If yo like TD games, give it a shot when it's on sale. But I am pretty sure every other TD veteran will look at this in disgust.",
