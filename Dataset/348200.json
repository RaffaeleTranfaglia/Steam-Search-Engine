            "review_text": "I'm gonna go with a tentative upthumb on this. There's potential here, but it needs further refinement.  The interface is simple and easy to use. Mostly intuitive. I was able to start writing stupid garbage in no time at all. Real work may take longer. ymmv.  The always on statistics in the bottom right is nice. It helps to know when you've been writing too damn long and should go eat something. Or use the restroom. Or let the dogs out to use the ... nevermind, they don't need to go anymore. I wish my games had that.  I have one observation and one complaint. Observation: This comes with an encrypt your story option. The instructions direct you to reset your encryption key by deleting it. But, oh, by the way, make sure not to delete the key before you decrypt your story first. You did? Oh, well then, I need to you open Windows to the folder where your story is saved. Now lean forward to your monitor. Put your lips directly on the filename you saved your story under. I know you don't have a touchscreen; just trust me on this. Put your lips right on the filename. Now gently but firmly kiss it goodbye. You ain't never gonna see it again, Bubba.  Yeah, there could be a bit of refinement there. Maybe add the option to the program to reset the key (which the program would then do), but prohibit doing it while the story is encrypted. That might save some tears. Just a thought.  Complaint: Once I save my notes on a character, there's no way (that I can find) to edit them again. They're saved and locked in for all time forever and ever. After all, characters never go through changes over the course of a story. Or series.  Most likely this is either an interface problem (in which the user can't find how to do it), or an oversight in the development of the program. This is, however, a significant issue. Notes can be edited after saving them, but not a character (which is a special kind of note).  Finally, it would be nice (and may be possible with the right addons) to create different kind of notes. What if I want my character to list a race, color, height, weight, etc (Skippy the 3'4' purple and pink polka dotted goblin boy of 12 months old). Or, I want to create a robot. Or my characters are planets. Yeah, pretty planets. With colors. And sparkles. Okay, I'll lay off the acid. But my point stands. Not all 'Characters' are human.  A note type for organizations or groups would also be nice.  Anyway, my two cents (or $8.99 as the case may be).  -----  Update 4/21/15: After a bit of back and forth (See the comments on this review for details), there is a workaround for the complaint since it was a formatting issue on my screen.  And I can create new note types easily with a text editor in the NoteModels folder quite easily, which addresses my other concerns.  So that makes it a very nice package.",

            "review_text": "Nimble Writer is a great writing program. It's really useful, I can have an image to one side and my text on the other, so I can write with no distractions. There are also plenty of themes to choose from to make the page look unique. You can organise stories into chapters and stuff too, which is a great feature to have in a writing program so you don't get confused. I would say however, there is the occasional bug, e.g you have to click an image 4 times in stead of 2 to make it appear etc.  Overall a great, simple writing program that's much better than overpriced word processors like Microsoft word.",

A lot of import and export options. The steam achievements really help to motivate you to write as well. Feels very comfortable and the editor is great and runs smooth.  How could it improve?  - Per chapter metadata.  - The ability to assign hotkeys to chapter management or allowing the user to cut and paste entire chapters.  - Drag and drop chapter management. - Intelligent justification of lines during export (ie don`t justify a title line etc).  If you are a creative writer, even for planning design phase of video game development or writing a novel or even working on the preliminaries for a script, I`d recommond this one for the price. It makes working with the elements of your story more like working with the records of a database.  I wish I`d gotten it sooner.",

            "review_text": "Before anything, I think it's hilarious how they have achievements for this. XD  I found this looking through software on the steam store and I am thoroughly impressed with this program. This is great no matter what kind of writer you are. It provides all the materials and settings you need to perfect your writing just the way you want it to be!  As of this review, I have used this for just about an hour to write a short story and to mess around with all the features in this program. I haven't found anything I didn't like with this, all good things! This is very convienent as you can just launch open Steam and launch this in a matter of seconds. They provide plenty of ways to export your work as well, my preference is Adobe Reader and an HTML page. And I do believe they update this pretty regularly to fix bugs and issues and to add new features.   Although there are other writing programs that are free and easy to use, this one is great if you want a little more customization and organization when you're writing. I suggest you have a good interest in writing though, because you won't get the $10 back if you buy this and love it, yet you don't enjoy writing.   For me, I'll be messing with this when I want to write and when I'm looking to play something but don't know what yet.    Thanks for reading! Check out these other links!

            "review_text": "This software is great!   While you have to pay for the program, in my honest opinion, it is so much better than when I was writing on Word.I generally have to type out my stories because my hands get sore really easily, but while Word has let me type up my stories for many years, I hated the brightness and I was always distracted.  Somehow, this software though, let's me focus on everything I want to write. It has a dark screen so my eyes don't hurt a lot but if you don't like the dark screen, that is okay because you can also change the color whenever you want. The program also comes with notes that you can jot down conveniantly next to your writing. So if you want to see your notes, just go to your left tab and they will be right there.  This left tab also organizes all your chapters. Unlike Word where you have to save each chapter and then create a new document, you can simply just create a new chapter and save everything together if you wish.   The spellcheck works fine. It doesn't distract me like Word does where it puts a red or green scribble everytime I mess up somewhere. I can just continue writing and if I make a mistake, I can just check them when I'm done.   The software also allows you to export your story to different websites and even convert them for ebooks. You can also find some exporters in the workshop such as for  fictionpress.net.  Though, this program is fairly new on steam so there won't be a lot of options right now for you to choose. There is also a importer where you can take your documents and finish or fix them in Nimble Writer.  Overall, it's basic, non-distractive, and conveniant. If this is what you are looking for in a writing program, you should get this one.",

Nimble though has such promise. The Dev seems to be listening to his community, the software works and has new features added all the time, plus steam workshop (which I hope gets more added to it then just themes).  It works as a distraction free writing software and I love it, I have spent some time customizing it to my preferences and am writing better then ever.  1 thing I would love is Multi Monitor detection for fullscreen as I have to turn my left monitor off or it distracts me, however if it used it to show my notes and the main screen for the writing I would be over the moon (not sure if its do able)  My other complaint is, where was this software when I started writing now im having to back track and write all my notes out but alas its a small price to pay. That and the actual small price of Nimble  10/10 would write a Review again",

            "review_text": "While this program is a small program, having notes, chapter support - it works mostly like a specialised version of notepads out there. Synch via STEAM is great. The setup is simple, mainly based to get to writing. You can export to many formats and make an environment that is OK to write in.  Problem is that the graphical setup is wonky - you can make the worskapce in your flavor nor adjust size of windows or space. You can control the padding of it, i.e width of certain windows, but not exact placement or height of support framdes like notes, characters etc.  The program is easy to get into and delivers on core functionality. I don't think that it will be something for professionals - but for people that want a simple program and get started with writing - it is helpful with chapters and notes.",

The bookmarks, story / character notes, and doodles you can create are great tools to help you organize your thoughts. The name generator and built-in wiktionary are handy resources you cannot live without. And, I get several export options to wrap up my entire project. Not to forget, there's a growing number of Workshop addons that help to personalize your copy of Nimble Writer as well as seek to improve productivity.  What can I say?  The ease with which you will go into writing your story, the joy with which you will get when managing your first few chapters, and the ecstasy with which you will revel in when you finally complete that hefty novel of yours.   Plus there are achievements for novelists. Definitely FTW!  So why waste your time scrivening with some expensive tool when you can get very nimble with Nimble Writer?",

If anything, having the ability to make scene files for the chapters and have them grouped underneath (e.g. Chapter 1 with Scene 1, Scene 2, etc. underneath) and the ability to drag and drop the chapters would be wonderful.

            "review_text": "First up, Nimble Writer is indeed rather short on feautures. No grammar check, no thesaurus, and yes, I have found a few bugs. Those cons aside, NimbleWriter is nonetheless a clean, compact writing program with a good interface that works as advertised. There is a certain productivity that oozes from it for me, and I'm not exactly sure why.  The primary reason I've started using it is the organization of chapters and character notes into one file. Gone are the days of Excel, Word, the internet and Paint all being open at once. Now, it's just me, the dictionary/thesaurus and this program - at least for the drafting stage.  The ability to export to various formats doesn't hurt either. Personally, I love that it tracks your efforts in terms of hours logged and words written. I'm a sucker for metrics, especially when they give you a form of tangible credit at the end of the day. Would I use this program just because it has Steam achievements? No way, but it sure doesn't hurt anything. Pair the above with Steam Workshop, the fact that the devs appear responsive and you have a program that is at least worth a closer look.

From what I could tell, it doesn't have an auto-save feature. A buggy writing program that's prone to crashing with no auto-save? That sounds like a recipe for disaster and paranoia to me. Which is fine, I guess, if you're working with a word processor from 1993.  Also, some of the “features” are a bit misleading. For instance, the spellchecker isn't a true spellchecker. It produces a number that indicates how many words in the document are misspelled... but it doesn't tell you which ones or where.   Scrivener offers way better features, including everything that Nimble Writer has. Plus it's way more stable. Spend the extra dough and save yourself a headache. This program needs a lot more refinement.",

Now that I tried the features advertised the only thing that would make me use this over word is the color of the interface.   It is kind of nifty that you can make notes, character sheets, webpages, etc, but it doesn't make up for the odd way when you actually input formatting. I'd like that text appear as bold, and to have images linked to the text rather than just able to open them to look at it next to the page. There is also a whole lot of shifting between using the mouse and keyboard. If I write in word you can have a seperate document with character information and alt-tab between them quicker than with a mouse click. I feel no typing flow at all.  Re-organizing your chapters requires right-clicks as well and I in general find it counter-intuitive not to have more click-and-drag functions. Again I will have to compare with word where the navigation panel allows you do do exactly the same much easier.   I really wanted to like this but if there aren't some major changes I won't use it for anything longer than a chapter-less short-story. A story with more chapters and sub-chapters would be much too slow to navigate.  I might have misunderstood things, and I suspect I have, but that is again because of the lack of a proper tutorial, the only one I found was a small review on youtube.   I will be on the look-out for updates since I am hopeful that it might become useful in the future.",
