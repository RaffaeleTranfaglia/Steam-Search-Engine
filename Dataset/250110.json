Let me tell you!  - Awesome Bosses (with bullet-hell-ish attack patterns) - 25 Levels with a few cutscenes - Infinity Drive (Survival Mode) - Daily Drive (a randomized daily level with changing enemies and bosses) - 3 color-coded powerups that you don't want to miss! - 9 different playable androids, each with their own unique primary and secondary attacks - Cute but solid visuals that fit the genre really well - 4 player local co-op - Great Soundtrack (I mean it!) - Unlimited framerate!  Please give this game some love! It was in early access for over 3 years and has received a ton of polish. Its current post-release state is fantastic and I couldn’t find any bugs.  For those not looking for repeat plays to compete for score, the price might be too high and you could wait for a sale. That said I still feel it’s absolutely worth the money and I’d recommend it to anyone who has any interest in twin stick shooters!",

You can select between 9 different characters (4 from start, the rest though the course of the campaign), all with their own different personalities as well as weapons and playstyles that vary your playstyle greatly.

If you're thinking about buying this on a console, you might wanna stick to PC after all. Why is that? PC has the cheapest controllers\\input devices and believe me - you WILL throw those around screaming. Also, the game is fairly discourageing at the beggining, but you shouldn't judge it too quickly. It isn't as hard as it seems. Last subject of importance - the score attack nature of the game. I don't like score attack games most of the time, this one is different. It's not a score attack game, it's a shmup with a score-attack system in it, which makes it more fun to keep playing for a long time. I doubt you'll be getting 200 hours of gameplay for 13 bucks elswhere. Aspecially 200 hours you enjoy and feel satisfied after.",

It is never an overwhelming shooter, that is until you start high score chasing and playing the 'drive' modes. This game wants you to play through to the end on campaign mode. Each character has their strengths and weaknesses and finding out each for each character will be very fun. The only thing I could hope for in this game is for a better or more detailed bio for the character Starch. All the bosses seem terrified of her and I really want to know what this incident is that mandated her shut down and lock up. It just has to be a great story. Plus her dialogue is hilarious. Is it obvious that she is my favorite character? If this game runs so well on my gaming PC i can just imagine how well it will run on my PS4 when released. I cannot wait, this will be one of a very few games I will purchase twice. Before I forget let me mention the soundtrack. It is pretty good as well. It lends perfectly to the very fst nature of the game. Some levels will have better tracks than others but nowhere in the soundtrack would you say it is underwhelming. If you don't like shooters I think this one will change your mind. If you think you have played the best shooter try this one to let it try to change your mind. This is one game on Steam (and soon on consoles) that has earned it's brilliant reputation.",

            "review_text": "I don't usually write reviews but when a game gets me feeling strongly enough be it bad or good i cant help it. In this case, i cant get enough.   Now, i SUCK at bullet-hells and usually cant get anywhere and thusly hate playing them save a few acceptions. this is one of those.   IN SHORT: BUY THIS  though a longer look here's more:  dont get me wrong that does not mean this is not challenging... getting that S+ rank... yeah... calling that easy would be a lie to say the very least.   I originally bought this game a LONG time ago back after seeing Nerd3 play it. i just had to have it and it was even fun way back then but after a long blank of not being able to update due to internet i finally came back to it and im in love. There are VERY few games that i love enough to feel motivated to go full completionist on.... BUT I GOTTA GET THOSE S+ RANKS ;n;  The Characters are pretty good and diverse and there are times and a few lines that are pretty funny too. that opening cutscene was pretty swell. each character has their own playstyle to it due to how their weapons work thusly meaning a character swap will change how you play. Aubergine for example is pretty good as you can take cover while still shooting due to how her weapon works and i found Shiitake and Starch were better for bosess as they had weapons that fit single target damage. Coral is an ideal crowdsweeper but is a risky play as you have to get close.... and so on.  i know i've said 'i dont usually' alot here but its true, this game got me notcing things that take alot to get me to notice. thusly i transition onto music. its rare i notice ingame music but when i do i love it. this one, well, the main menu theme is catchy enough as it is. never seen a death screen with lyrics and at first i was kinda put off by it but honestly after it grew on me i kinda get tempted to stay dead and listen now.  I will DEFINATLEY by the OST for this when i get the money and that makes a first for me. i've got a few one off tracks i listen to sometimes from games i like such as fleets arrive from mass effect and a fair few choice tracks from Legend of dragoon but this? well i like it enough to buy it without hesetation.  The extras are pretty fun too. being able to set A.I coop players on is a fun idea and i like the additional options you can unlock to make things even harder for yourself. still yet to try them all. First person mode in a bullet-hell is something im looking forward to..... in a kinda Masohcistic way...  it runs pretty well on my computer and even on my crappy really old worn down useless laptop for that matter before it hit the point it cant run ANYTHING and thats saying something. back when this ran on my laptop you'd have better chances getting a flash game to work on a calculator in most cases.   the graphics and artstyle are nice and while not superhyperrealiticultraperfect levels most people dream for they dont need to be as the graphics look good as they feel styled. i feel it will likley age well because of that. i've played plenty of old games that still look good today because they took a style to their graphics and went with it instead of trying to look realistic. this is a game i feel will be able to pull that off.   as many people have said before the one thing that would make this game one of the best things ever is easily an online multiplayer. co-op modes for this game would do it a world of good and the level where the boss has android health even implies you could have some rather fun competative modes too. however even without those this game holds up on its own but that would of been the icing on the cake for me and im sure plenty of other people would agree. Im not sure what the Devs of this game have planned but i'd like to maby see more of this game and maybe some DLC or expansions. the story and ending works well to say you could easily have more stories and levels and so on and i'd love to see more and learn more about this world and the characters in the game.  Overall i HIGHLY reccomend this game. it is well worth a look even if you aren't so much a fan of the type of game it is. i usually dont go for twinsticks or bullet-hells and i love this gamenevertheless.  It was good back in its early stages and it has easily improved alot since then to even greater levels.   Now thats enough typing.... i have some S+ ranks to go get...",

I'm not a huge bullet hell or schmup player, but this game has a great difficulty curve and the battery mechanic does set it apart from other titles. The battery serves as the fail condition when it is empty and it forces the player to stay on their toes and keep engaging in the action.

            "review_text": "I was pleasantly surprised by Assault Android Cactus. I usually am not a huge fan of the twin stick shooter genre because frankly I am usually not very good at them. The main reason I am terrible at these games is that I have a hard time avoiding enemies when there is a bunch of things happening on the screen at one time.  Therefore I really liked the idea behind the battery power. In Assault Android Cactus you don't die when your lose all of your health. Instead you are stunned. You need to make sure that your android doesn't run out of battery power though. In order to recharge your batteries you need to kill enough enemies in order to have one drop a battery powerup. I liked that Assault Android Cactus allowed you to focus on killing enemies instead of spending all your time trying to avoid enemy projectiles.   The only major issues I had with the game was the length and difficulty. The main storyline only takes four to five hours to complete. Outside of the bosses the game is quite easy and you will rarely die.   If you hate twin stick shooters you won't like Assault Android Cactus. If you have even a passing interest in the genre I would recommend picking up the game at some point either at full retail or during a sale.

            "review_text": "Assault Android Cactus was one of my early purchases since joining Steam a couple of years ago, and even in its Early Access stage, had remained one of my favorite games from my library. Now that it's finally complete, I would love for anyone who's been on the fence to give this wonderful arcade blast-a-thon a go.  What makes AAC such a great videogame is that it is just that -- a damn videogame. There's no need here for bloaty features like RPG elements, perks, weapon customization, or what have you. If you just wanna turn off your brain an' go out gunz a-blazin' with unlimited ammo, this game is it, and the three-person Witch Beam crew were steadfast in delivering that experience. With little to get in your way, AAC is perfect pick-up-and-play fun for both casual players and S+ experts.  After a short tutorial and a couple of cutscenes, the game catapults your chosen Android into a campaign filled with relentless robots ready to wreck you. Using your unique primary and secondary weapons, as well as some helpful temporary powerups, you must destroy wave after wave of bots or duke it out with a fearsome Section Lord before proceeding to the next stage. Five hits will knock your character down, but you can press the buttons repeatedly to get back up and continue the fight, no problem! But don't party just yet -- Assault Android Cactus also features an interesting gimmick in the form of the Battery Meter. Instead of relying on a limited number of Lives, the Game Over screen gleefully waits for your Android's power to completely drain during battle, so be on the lookout for occasional Battery drops from enemies to keep yourself afloat. This feature adds to the intensity of the game, as you're encouraged to balance between being careful and getting aggressive.  If you wanna take a break from AAC's Campaign, there are indeed other modes to try out: Boss Rush, the Daily Drive, and the endless Infinity Drive. There are also fun unlockables ('funlockables'?), such as other playable Androids, and with enough hard-earned in-game credits, you can purchase character art and bios, story info, and the excellent EX Mode features. The EX Modes alter the game in cool ways, such as placing the gameplay in First Person view, changing the graphics (can you handle Psychedelic?), or even allowing helpful A.I.-controlled Androids to assist you for faux co-op play.   Speaking of co-op, while up to four players can have at it, I should mention that it is local only, as Witch Beam did not have the means to work in online multiplayer. AAC was originally to be only single-player, but they were able to change that at least. I sincerely hope the lack of online co-op doesn't deter you from trying out this game, and that perhaps the unlockable A.I. mode will suffice.  Again, if you're looking for simply 'a damn videogame', and don't mind local co-op, I highly and wholeheartedly recommend Assault Android Cactus. A lot of love was put into this game, and it definitely shows. Pick up an' play it!  ",

Plus they're all really cute and full of personality! The level design is great and is constantly changing things up or throwing new surprises at you. All of them are different and have really cool visual theming too, since each one is a different section of the ship the game takes place on, like hydroponics or freight zones. The music is some awesome EDM and it really gets you pumped to blow up robots, and keeps you going when you lose and retry.  I also really like the battery mechanic, where your battery constantly drains and you have to kill enemies to get more recharges before it drains down and you die. It fits so well into the core loop of shooting and dodging enemies and their bullets, and succeeds in making a bullet hell type of game that is really freindly while still giving a great level of challenge. It also makes the action, which is already fast-paced and relentless as hell, even more tense when you're on the verge of running out and are fighting extra hard to find that one enemy holding the recharge.  Also the boss battles are great and it has a whole bunch of neat extra modes and mutators. And local co-op multiplayer!! My girlfriend and I played through a bunch together and its a really fun way to play since you share a battery meter and have to watch out for each other.

Assault Android Cactus is a twin stick shooter, where the goal is to kill every enemy in each stage of the game. Thats it. Thats all you do here, the 'story' it presents is just an excuse to give some sort of context for the player to get back into the action, and besides shooting enemies, there really isnt much else for you to do here. And thats why this game is so great. It has no pretenses about what it is, and it uses its genre to full effect to give you one of the best arcade experiences in the last few years. Every stage is a frenetic chase to the end goal, with the screen filling with impossible levels of enemies and bullets while you do your best to avoid it all and stay alive for as long as you can, and every arena introduces a unique layout to shake things up, from floors disappearing when you step on them, to laser beams moving across the screen at certain intervals and making you run for cover just in time. The game also introduces a brilliant game mechanic where your character has a battery that depletes as time goes by and that can only be charged back by killing a certain number of enemies. This means you can never play it safe and stick to a corner waiting for enemies to come at you, as you will have to chase them at numerous times during the game just to get that recharge before you run out and fail the stage. This is what makes the game unique among other similar titles, as it provides alot of entertaining stressful moments where you are running against time as you throw yourself at every enemy just to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ recharge. The game has a huge list of characters to pick from, each with their own unique weapons and skills, so the game never gets stale, and gives ample room for experimentation and player preference. It also comes with bosses, and they all significantly ramp the difficulty up with creative attack patterns and alternate forms, the Final Boss being one of the highlights of the game. Soundtrack is amazing and perfect for this game, with one of the best Game Over tracks I have heard in a long time, that alone is worth losing a stage on purpose. So yeah, if you truly like engaging videogames that actually demand the player's effort and attention, then please give this a chance, it truly deserves more love than it gets right now.  And who knows, you might actually like the characters and story more than I do",

Each android has 2 different weapons and all of then are quit different to play with, you can anytime change your android between the areans or at the end of it. You able to play solo or in coop until 4 players.  Inside the areans you will be able to get power ups and you need to collect batteries to stay a life. This can become very thrilling specially during the boss fights. But lucky overall the game is very fair with the battery drops and you mostly able to escape near death during a normal area. ;) The boss fights itself are all very good and fun to play.   During my first play season I lost myself in the game and get really excited from it and I start replaying areanes and boss fight over and over again just because I was so close to a better rating or the area was just crazy because of the amount of enemies in it or want to try the same boss fight with a different android.  The grafic and the style of the game is very colourful and depends on the zones with different themes, all with nice light effects. Depends on the themens and the situation the music is also all the the time changing to it. The soundtrack of the game is full of good electronic music and its easy to get catched in the music and fight like it.   There are many things to unlock in the game starting with galleries, sounds, music too new androids, mods or tweeks on the game like different views, mega weapons. xD   If you like arena or bullet hell shooters and highscore races then this game is a must buy for you.  Personally this is my favorite game of 2015 with the most fun and enjoyment, no other game what i played that year was so good as this one and could take me in its ban for so long.",

The reason I bring those games up is because the twin stick shooter genre is one of the oldest there is, and somehow a little indie developer named Witch Beam has made a title that is one of the best in it's class... now onto the game.  Assault Android Cactus is a hybrid of sorts.   It's mostly a twin stick shooter, but there's a bit of bullet hell in it's DNA. The first few levels are fairly easy, as you progress the game gets harder, as more enemies appear on screen AAC becomes more of a bullet hell, and you have to make smart use of the invincibility you receive when you switch weapons.  There's 8 playable characters, each 'Android' has a unique primary and secondary weapon, and a bit of personality. All 8 play pretty different, and i'm sure you'll find at least one or two that fit your playing style. Witch Beam actually put a story with voice acting and cutscenes, something you rarely see in this genre. It's not the best story ever told but it has a lot of charm and style, and is a nice bonus.  Only real complaint I have is the last boss. Maybe i'm just terrible, but the last boss seems far more difficult than the rest of the game, and to this day I can only seem to beat it with a particular character, and only that one. But maybe i'm just doing it wrong, i'm not sure. Other than that, the game is excellent, looks and plays beautifully and I can see me returning in the following months even though I've finished AAC and play some more of the endless mode.",
