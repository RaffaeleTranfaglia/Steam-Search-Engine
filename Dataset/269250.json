            "review_text": "World End Economica is a visual novel, plain and simple. As a visual novel of the 'Kinetic' variety, there are no decisions to make or actions to take; it is more accurate to think of WEE as a book rather than a game. It could take a fast reader at least ~8 hours to get through it all.  Though the novel is appropriate for younger audiences, there are economic concepts which may be more suitable for those in the young adult range. All in all, it is a novel appropriate for a wide range of ages, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants some light sci-fi to pass the time.  The strength of the novel lies in being both simple and complex when it needs to be. With a small cast of characters involved, it's easy to keep track of them all, and all characters feel like they're a significant part of the story. This might not be a story with spells or lasers, but the author certainly does not dissapoint when it comes to assigning high stakes. Explaining further may ruin parts of the story, but allow this reviewer to at least say this: anyone who reads this to the end will be begging for the next episodes (which are currently being translated).  A few Engrish errors happen on a rare occasion, but not enough to ruin the story. Whether you be a new reader curious of what Visual Novels are all about, or for an avid reader looking for some light reading, WEE is an enjoyable experience for many.  One concern: as is the case with nearly all visual novels, this book isn't for anyone who doesn't like anime-esque visuals, and much older audiences may have trouble enjoying this book. Other than that, it's a good ~10 hours of well written sci-fi/economics that makes one yearn for more.",

Big emphasis on economics and the stock market (felt like having an Economics 101 crash course).   Characters are interesting enough to keep the reader interested.   Was not expecting that type of ending.   The music is relaxing and nice to listen to.    Cons    A few written mistakes here and there but it is no big deal.   Could of used a bit more background art in some scenes.   This will probably make me wanna watch or read Spice and Wolf.  7.5/10",

            "review_text": "World End Economica definitely met my expectations, although I'd still say I prefer Spice and Wolf if given the option between the two.  The story is kinetic VN about a boy who has decided to go to the stock market to make money and his journey. The author clearly knows what he is talking about when he wrote this VN. However, if one is not very financially literate, the VN will be a bit of a challenge to understand. Considering that I am a finance major and know about stocks and how the market works, I understood everything that was happening in this VN. In fact, I can say that the VN made the stock market look way TOO simple compared to the way it is actually. Futhermore, there was some nice references that some people would have caught. For example, Daniel Trap who bought a tower in Manhattan who had gone bankrupt 3 times... HMMMMM Also Carlyle Group is an actual company although in the VN it was Carlyle Investments. One other thing was that the stock market in the VN followed the Japanese market time from 9-5 instead of the US one from 9:30-4. Finally, the ending of the VN really laid the cold truth out there and I really enjoyed that realistically because before that, it just seemed like the stock market was a place where people can profit easily. But those detail aside, the VN presented a nice thought stimulating experience, especially for someone like me who is interested in the field.  Aside from the good parts of this VN, I thought the character development was a bit shallow to say the least. Some of the parts seemed a bit forced and the connection was surface level from one to another. Although you can see the growth in the character relations, I still felt like it came too sudden and sometimes too unexplained. That is one of the main reasons why I'd choose Spice and Wolf over World End Economica, because in Spice and Wolf, the character development was amazing.  Overall, definitely worth playing/reading this VN because it is really good. I look forward to better character development in episode 2 and 3 and for an amazing conclusion!  Rating: 8.4/10 Recommend: $5 or under",

            "review_text": "I will make this short: The game is a Kinetic Novel, which makes it a dialogue heavy book with background und characters drawn out for the reader and some BGM to listen to. The kinetic means there are no choices to be made.  The world is quite interesting, the character are well written and fit the story, the drawings look good and the soundtrack is fitting to the mood. If you are interested in a story about the stock market, high frequency trading and the economy in general you are pretty limited to begin with, but World End Economica delivers an above avarage experience in all points (if you like points you could say everything can be located between 6-8/10) and is a good choice.   Now to the negative part: There isn't that much here to discuss, but i think the main point is the fact that World End Economica is in fact a kinetic novel, which means that the reader has no influence whatsoever over the direction the story and characters are going. There is still something that makes this a negativ point for me and that is the fact that you can see some scenes where choices would have been in the game and it feels like they cut them out on short notice. While i can understand why they would cut out the choices (choices are a lot of work if you want to implement them in a meaningful way; you have to make sure the choices matter and every branch and decision has weight behind them, which is especially hard when you consider multiple episodes and more and more branching), it is still a bit sad to see them cut the influence a player (instead of a pure reader) could have on the game.   But that is my only gripe with the game and if you are even remotely interested in a beginner friendly introduction to any of the topics mentioned above you should check out this kinetic novel.",

            "review_text": "A masterfully written VN. Cannot recommend enough.  As a whole, the story takes a long time to get going, but if you have the patience for its pacing, it will pay off immensely and you are definitely getting bang for your buck (especially if you pick this up on sale). It takes its time with setting up; World building is fantastically done and used to its benefit. The characters with the most screentime are multifaceted, engaging, play well off each other, and carry a variety of emotions.   If you're skeptical on how talk about economics and stock trading is integrated into the story, don't be. For the most part, explanations are fluid, interesting, engage well with the story, and feeds off high-intensity trading sessions and highly-competitive showdowns between buyers and sellers. The intensity is gripping and it makes for a story that can be funny, exhilerating, tragic, and intimate. A great OST punctuates these moments very well.  I can nitpick where it falls short in general multimedia presentation (poor music looping, at times lazy use of CGs, too many black screens and not enough visual depictions of, well, graphs), but for a VN you are staying for the story and the strength of its writing. And I would be hardpressed to name VNs on Steam that can top it in that department.  If you care at all about VNs, this is a must have for your steam library. Looking forward to more episodes!",

So there is this boy who wants to have a bunch of money because money buys power. He runs away from home and picks up stock trading, and like all twelve-year old runaways who trade stocks, he immediately makes a profit of several thousand percents. But danger lurks everywhere, because the police figures him for a bill-dodger and bull-dodgers are second in heinousness only to nuclear terrorists. Oh, and the game is set on the moon, but that's the least weird thing there is.  While running away, he meets Lisa, who runs a christian church and offers him shelter, and Hagana, a young girl who is also sheltered by Lisa and whom our protagonist immediately wants to ♥♥♥♥ and take revenge porn pics of. (Note: I am not kidding, this is totally a thing that happens.)  The next two hours or so are all about economic thrills, and by that I mean buying clothes, paying rent and food, and paying interest rate on loans, which are all really important topics for a teen who has, y'know, A HUGE BUNCH OF MONEY ON HIS BANK ACCOUNT. But fear not, because it's not actually about those daily routines: It's actually about the deep character interaction between Captain Rapeydouche and Hagana. It's some of the most cliché writing I've seen for quite some time and Hagana, with her two facial expressions (one of which can corrode steel from fifty paces and the other one makes her shoot lasers from her eyes), completely fails to be a relatable character.  I'm three hours in, there is no interesting plot in sight for miles, the writing is boring, the characters are all stereotypes (save for Lisa, who desperately wishes to be in another game), there is no interactivity whatsoever and now I'm stopping. I don't care for anything that goes on in this excuse for a visual novel.  On the plus side, the artwork is nice (if inconsistent). Instead of buying the game, just look at the Steam screenshots.

I would recomend this to people who love a good story but do not expect it to be filled with typical action scenes. Also if you dont like economics or bartering, this is not for you. The story revolves around making money.  Also it was a decent long read. Not the short stories you sometimes get. I'm a pretty fast reader but it took me 13hours to read through this.   Many people prefer to make decisions in the story. Well i'm sorry to say that this is NOT a game. It is more like a book which you read. So if you go into this prepared to make decisions for the main character, dont bother playing it because it's not happening.   I came across some typo's or strange sentences but nothing too big in my opinion.  I certainly can't wait for episode 2 to see how the story evolves.  On a scale to 10 where 10 is perfect, 7 decent, 5 neutral and below 5 bad to extremely BAD. I would give this a 7 due to the black screen backgrounds and the typos. Otherwise it would have been 8.",

Also expect a lot of reading and clicking, because this is a pure visual novel. There are absolutely no choices to make. I wish there were some more visuals to this novel. There were a few scenes that was all black, plus a few that didn't quite match the context. For example, one scene has a guy sleeping on a couch. The story then has him wake up, move to a desk, and start working, but the scene still shows him lying on the couch. It becomes a little immersion breaking. There are also a noticeable number of typos that should not be in professional product, especially ones that could be caught with spell check.

Scene changes tend to be a black, blank screen, with a few flashes or short clips of image. Music is simple, elegant, and tactful, if limited in flavour. Finally, the VN is a long read, I felt I got my worth for sure.  The biggest issue I had, was again, the ending. To quote another reader, 'This ending was extremly abrupt. It hurt me on so many levels and left me really upset. Not only are there no 'routes' as its a single story but to end Ep 1 on that note my chest hurts atm. That was really painful for me. I knew something bad was coming but good god.'   *Spoiler*   I just wish she had stayed, and he had listened. I loved her growth as a person/character, and her growth with him.

It almost like your in their conservation. None of the character felt like they are not needed in the story but instead open new view point on life and money. Really like all the character even if some of them intend to be annoying or presented poorly at first.  Narrative  This a mixed feeling where the narrative can be improved. The story is been told by the main character, Hai. He was introduced as arrogance young boy who became interested in the stock market. At times, Hai can be childish and annoying and many new reader can start to hate him. Personally, Hai's narratives helps show his character and personality and better understand him on how he view things and his thought. This is a plus in my book but the thing that annoy me is how Hai described economy terms, the stock market and the setting. The narrative did explain the reader of their situation to better understand them but it intend to be long and may have to reread it to understand. Not very easy to catch up with the explanation and few times i have to reread it. Not a huge minus but it can be improve to make it easier to read.  Visual/Sound Mostly good on both the visual and the sound. The artstyle is very good quality and presented the situation in story very well. There were many rememberable artwork in the story and love everyone last of it. My only complain of the artwork is not enough. There are times in the story where i just see pitch black and block of text. This frustrate me because i want more artwork rather than leaving it to my imagination to image the artwork. The music helps set the mood of how story was presented. It helps feel the emotion of the character and situation. The music has like few rememberable songs I like for example, Escape.  Story Oh boy, the main reason why we buy this game right? The story is executed prefectly. Never a moment I felt bored in the story. The story first introduced slowly and peacefully. It was to set the setting and the characters. It may bored some people at first but the juicy part is the climax. The climax was what brought me in the story and better understand the characters. Not going to spoil it but it was good.   As for the story prgression. The story is believeable for the most part and show some real life problems. It introduced themes and problem in real life that i have to stop and think for a moment. Those themes were presented differently depending on the character and that the major plus side of the story. Do i agree with his view or not?   What brought my intention the most was character development. We see how character changed over the course of the story for better or worse. The character felt real when dealing with his/her problem and how they change. It very relatable to the cast of character as they grow farther in the story.  My only complain of the story is they left it on a cliff hanger. I just want more.  Overall I really enjoy this and would recommend anyone who would like to enjoy a heavily engage story.",

I for one eagerly await the other two parts of this VN - count me in for pre-orders! :D   Excellent art style, if a tad bland in some sections (tho it did match the storyline at those points), good choices with music - tho at times the music did get repetitive it didn't feel like it detracted from the flow - and unlike some VN's it matched the mood/feel of the content at the time.  Without spoiling things, I felt as moved by this as I did by Eden, or Reverie - my two other all time VN favourites! Yes, this is linear, but so is a normal book or manga - it's the content that grips you and to me that shows the mark of the content - how much it grabs you and holds you. Even though this is the first of a trilogy, it doesn't leave you massively dissatisfied at the end - yes, I really really want the next episode, but I want it without frustration if that makes sense.   The overall tone/mood will not be to everyone's tastes, nor will the pacing - but for me it's damned close to perfect. Again the emotional side of it will also not be to everyone's taste, nor will the lack of H content, but if you want those, you likely be better served with other options like Eden Mosaic ed, or Hunie Pop or such like. I personally love the rollercoaster this has on me - ymmv.  Overall, I seriously recommend picking this up now - don't wait for a sale - you honestly don't know what you'll be missing out on if you do!",

Some say that they hate reading, and some say that they'd pick up a book if they wanted to read a story, but I've started to like the genre.  This is an outstanding example of it, so long as you're interested in stuff like stock trading, sci fi, and the like, all wrapped up in a good story. I was in love with it just for the themes involved.  About 20 hours worth of story in this episode.",

Throughout the story the boy encounters a number of different people which completely change his life for good or for worse.",

The details of how the stock trading is done were well explained so I was able to follow along without any prior knowledge and get excited along with the characters.  This is a kinetic novel, so there is a story to progress through but no choices to be made. The characters were interesting and I felt myself cheering them on as well as being hit by a big dose of feels... Let's see how Episode 2 goes!",
