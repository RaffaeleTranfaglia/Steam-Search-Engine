            "review_text": "Star Trail is unique and one of the best RPG adventures i have ever played. World of Arkania is very alive and dynamic, beautiful artwork and fairy music, a lot of secrets to uncover and mysterys to reveal. I am very happy to see this game on steam........install now and become a part of the epic adventure.   A bit late , but i reccomend to edit - dosboxrealms2.conf - this file can be found in the game directory, few lines have to be changed: scaler=advmame2x ; cycles=18000 . scaler makes picture a bit softer and 18000 cycles looks like the optimal speed.",
