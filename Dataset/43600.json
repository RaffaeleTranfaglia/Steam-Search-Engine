I wouldn't call this one my favorite (Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon takes the cake for that), but I did enjoy it more than some other's (such as Danger in Design). I loved the mini games available: air hockey and scram. Both had me distracted from gameplay because of how much I enjoyed them. For this price, I'd say it's definietly worth the purchase.",
