Its like lego but you are on the losing side all the time.... if it was a game.  That said, it is quite rewarding when you make something really badass!",

The tiny bit of novelty in making your own designs wears off early and is quickly replaced with a sense of agonizing boredom as you rebuild your ship from the same base over and over and over for every level. Enemy AI seems target at a random. This is a good game in small doses, maybe 20 - 25 minutes at a time. Wait for a sale though, $9.99 is too much for what you get here. If you see it for 75% off, go for it.",
