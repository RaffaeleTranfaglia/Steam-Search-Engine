            "review_text": "2016-July-03  Quick Rundown: ------------------------ The good: Gameplay mechanics are solid, if a bit simplistic. The bad: Exceptionally difficult to find others to play with.  Verdict: A hopeful 6/10 in its current state. Fun for a quick romp but disappointed about not having enough friends to play with. Interface, matchmaking, and netcode need a few tweaks.  Potential: 8/10 with a solid-buy recommendation if matchmaking gets an overhaul. Once the multiplayer community gets up and running,   -  Built on the Unity engine, Kill to Collect is a 1-4 player skill based top-down brawler of sorts with an 80's neon/cyberpunk theme and music to match. KTC is an action-oriented tactical brawler with a good degree of challenge and a high skill ceiling, button-mashing wont serve you well here. The basic premise of the game is that you (and a group of friends if lucky) delve into futuristic / dystopian slums with the goal of hunting a bounty (boss) and clearing the place of its riff-raff. Along the way you will find one-time use heals, shields, powerups, deployables (such as mines), and even swappable ammo-based weapons as you make your way through the floor. At the end of each section you are allowed to take a break in the rec-room and spend some of the chips you've accumulated to buy yourself permanent upgrades, replenish your health and ammo, stock up on items, or purchase a different secondary weapon.  There are 4 character classes in Kill to Collect, and while they all feel fairly similar, they do each have their own strengths and weaknesses from being a slow-ish and tanky shotgun brawler with a Juggernaut-like ultimate ability to a crazy shock-staffed, jetpack-wearing, turret deploying crowd control character. Each of the four different classes has their own set of abilities that work better or worse against certain enemy types in a Gauntlet-esq manner, but are still similar enough so as to not become obsolete when used in solo play. Due to the nature of these differences, the game really shines in multiplayer when you can combine these with allied abilities, but thanks to a small playerbase, finding a multiplayer game can be quite difficult.  The brawler-esq 3rd person top-down combat in KTC is broken down into an exceptionally simple set of attacks and moves; A basic attack, a special knock-down attack on a cooldown, an ultimate ability on a kill-based cooldown, and a limited ammo-based interchangeable weapon. Additionally each character has their own dodge ability from a steerable and fast moving jetpack that can be used to knock enemies aside, to a short ranged blink which can teleport to the other side of an enemy (admittedly a bit fiddly), and of course a fairly plain-jane dodgeroll too. The special attacks for each character feel similar, but do impart different effects on the enemy from armor breaking debuffs which make an enemy take more damage on their next hit to stuns and knockdowns which in some cases are only effective against certain types of enemies.  An upgrade/unlock system of sorts is in place, but its incredibly simple and very linear. Basically, as you collect bounties (score) from playing and beating levels, you unlock skins and new loadouts which allow you to change the two starting items that you begin the game with. Loadouts are a fairly minor thing overall, but do influence the early-game. Unlocks for golden weapon skins are attained by completing objectives based around using those weapons, but these golden weapons dont appear to have any gameplay impact, nor can these skins be disabled.. so any uniqueness of each weapon's texture/color is basically lost after you've completed its associated task. Pieces Interactive definitely could have done a bit more with this system while maintaining balance and keeping power-creep at bay. In its current state these systems feel a little under-developed and disappointing. Collected bounty is basically just a measurement of how much you've played.. a global score of sorts; you dont use it to buy unlocks, loadouts, or skins, they just get unlocked when you reach a totally linear and arbitrary amount.  Ultimately the crippling factor for Kill to Collect at the moment is that its missing its multiplayer community. Its a solid game which needs more players. They've done a really good job with core fighting mechanics and balancing, and aside from a bit of peer-to-peer lag, the multiplayer mechanics feel pretty good. Revive systems are in place to keep the flow of the game going and reward players who are good by keeping them revived or bringing them back after locating or beating special rooms. The increased number of enemies in multiplayer offer additional challenge, and there is plenty of chaos and opportunity to work together to make some fun and exciting things happen based on the game's various knock-back mechanics and ragdoll-physics. If there was a stronger multiplayer community that allowed you to find games whenever you wanted, I feel that this game would offer a significantly higher value for its cost. As it stands, I cannot recommend Kill to Collect at its full price unless you absolutely love this type of game, or have a group of friends to play with. If you enjoyed games like Spiral Knights, then this will probably be something you will find familiar and appealing. Though due to the simple combat mechanics and lack of complex interactions in single player the game can feel a tad samey after awhile, having a friend or two to play with may make all the difference.  Final thoughts: Pieces Interactive needs to step up their marketing department and get people playing their game. Its a good title that gets put down all too quickly due to the lack of community to engage with. Single player delivers a couple of hours of good challenge while multiplayer offers some exciting, funny, and tensely rewarding moments. Sadly unless your friends own the game, theres almost no chance of finding a random multiplayer pick-up game to join at this time. Kill to Collect is a good game that Id enjoy playing with friends and with random people, sadly it will be difficult to convince friends to buy without an active multiplayer community and with such a flawed matchmaking system in place.  Pros: - Good visceral core combat mechanics. - Decent player character and enemy variety. - Has single player modes, offers a good challenge. - The kind of game that truly shines when played with friends.  Cons: - No multiplayer community as of 2016-07-03. Finding a random MP game is impossible. - Cant do anything but sit at the host screen while you wait for someone to join. - Host-side hit detection means that players will feel some lag / sluggish feedback. - Cannot disable autoaim for keyboard and mouse controls. - Maxes out GPU clocks, even when minimized and vsynced. (Radeon 7850) - Title is no longer receiving support. No contact or fixes from developers 6+ months.",

Combat itself is quite demanding but rewarding as you get better and better down the line. The games main strenght lies within its coop-mode though, this is due to the good interplay between the different characters that players can choose from.  So grab this for a few friends if you get it, well worth its asking price for sure (and now it is 25% off as well!!)",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying, that this as in me actually writing a review for a game  is an incredible thing on its own in this times because I am such a lazy person right now.  But the Gameplay of Kill to Collect evoked the urge to express myself, besides grinning like a maniac  once i cleared a particularly nasty room. (Ask my girlfiriend... it's a creepy sight to witness).   I realy enjoy playing throw the roguelike and twinstickshooter genre alike and love games like  Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon and hyper light drifter , which are great games, so when I realized  this has been able to up the gameplay even more it came as quite a surprise to me.   Highpoints:  the controls are slick meaning you have no useless keys to use, just 3 for standard attack, one cc ability and your Ultimate, 1 dodge and 4 consumable slots and they are spot on in the responsivity department.  the AI in this is so darn fitting, caster avoid you making it hard to get rid of them first, Ranged units kite you, all of them avoid area dmg from environmental hazards. The different enemies have such a distinguished set of behaviours making every room a unique challenge.  You can use the rooms against the enemies and feel smart about yourself,  the first time a purposefully threw myself into a pit, hanging onto the ledge to avoid a bounty bosses spinning attack, then jumping back up and cutting him to pieces... I felt great.  the sound is great, ability and impact sounds are well done. giving you exelent feedback, when an attack is coming etc.  and the graphic and physics in this nail the feeling of beeing a skilled contractor doing incredible stuff, into place.   The only room for improvement i see is,  in the worldbuilding, the feel of the world so to speak could be stronger.  maybe add the ability to walk around in the bounty bar and talk to ppl in there for some banter ( stay awhile and listen ). to make everything more coherent.   and little things, like a toggle for aimassist.  I shall finish this with a big thank you to Pieces Interactive for making this Game and thus making me  very happy , so thx guys!  P.S.: I apologize for my rather weak formal abilities when i comes to writing in english.",

A solid purchase if you're into new retro wave.   The price is rather steep, but you get a fun game for free on top of the album. If you're not into videogames you are probably better off picking the tracks up one by one from bandcamp or somewhere like that.",

            "review_text": "Gameplay design is solid, like if Torchlight had a baby with the Souls series and fell into a cave of Nethack, doled out in single-servings. The game's difficulty curve is pretty much a flat line and will well wait for you to 'Git Gud' enough to take on the enemies/combinations it throws at you.  This game is great if you want to play with yourself or one friend. This is why I don't reccomend this game. It fraudulently advertises 1-4 player co-op multiplayer. This comes with the implication it should be as responsive as the mechanics demand. Unfortunately, it does not. Once you throw a third or, god forbid, a fourth, the game simply can't handle it. 500-3000ms response times don't work in a top-down twitch action fighter. Perhaps these devs should 'Git Gud' and finish chipping their netcode into something that resembles a finished product. Unfortunately it took me 8 hours to get to the point where we convinced another unfortunate soul to get this, albeit on sale, in order to join us, so it appears we've been scammed outta 10 bucks.  Would reccomend for solo artist masocists if it's ever on for 75% off again.",
