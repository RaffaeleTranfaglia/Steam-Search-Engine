            "review_text": "Fantastic little arcade-style game. Simple, fast, challenging, colourful play. If you're looking at this game and thinking this is yet another Diner Dash type game, you would be wrong. It's not a time management style game at all.   It's a challenging old school maze game that's suited for twitchy play. You need to avoid the path of the customers in the shop as you serve them, and must serve them the food they ordered before they get angry.   So think more like... Pacman's maze and enemy-avoiding gameplay (but executed much better imo)... crossed with the fast-paced grabbing-orders-from-wherever-to-serve-quick-to-anger-customers of Midway's Tapper, then crossed with the matching orders to customers and collecting dirty dishes from games like Diner Dash. I also find myself thinking of an old LCD game I used to own, called 'Coffee House' by Sunwing.  Beautifully detailed cute retro art style, reminiscent of Taito arcade games of the late 1990s (think Puzzle Bobble 4). Your score when you get game over contributes towards unlockables, so that's a neat touch too. Full controller support, and it auto-saves.  Only problem so far with the game: it regularly crashes on exit. But hey, I was trying to exit anyway, so that doesn't matter too much.   And yes, I did get this game via a Steam key. The game was once part of a game bundle, and was actually the main reason I bought that whole bundle. I forgot about it and didn't actually play it until today, though.  EDIT - 14/09/2016: This game was crashing a lot during gameplay yesterday. So much that I was re-thinking my thumbs-up on this review, even though I really like the game. I sent a lot of bug reports to the dev, and so did some others, and it was patched within hours. Hasn't crashed during gameplay since then. It still crashes on game exit though.",
