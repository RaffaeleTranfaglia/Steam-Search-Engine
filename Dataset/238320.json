            "review_text": "'What are you going to play next?' 'Umm. Outlast I guess. It's been in my backlog since summer. Supposed to be scary or something.'  And there I went. Oblivious to what I was getting into. Honestly, I had only watched 2 minutes of vids online and a Conan O Brian review. Then came the game; immediately creepy. And it quickly moved on to scary and terrifying. The world seemed a bit Portal 2-ish, but the actual gameplay...was amazing. Pacing, story, real HORROR, and tension like I had not really felt in a horror game. Not that I have played a ton of horror titles, but I would put it on par with early Silent Hill games.  I won't go into the details. Really, it would spoil it for you. Honestly, very basic. You are a reporter checking out the weird stuff happening at the aslyum. And then you walk in into an evil Wonderland complete with menacing large evil killers and a nutso with no pants.  Speaking of that, tweedle-nude and tweedle-nuder didn't get me once. I was kinda proud of that.   You can't fire a gun or use a weapon. The only defense is running, hiding, ducking, and having your heart up in your throat as Chris Walrider walks by you...aw! He found me! AwHHHHHH!! RUNNNN!!!  Of all the games I have played this year, this has to be one of the best made in totality. The length is just right. Cues and progression move at an exact rhythm that does not allow you to slow your scare down. The jumpscares are there, but are by no means the meat of the game. There are no useless time wasting missions. Everything has a reason and the most annoying mission in the game  is perhaps one of the most terrifying when you do not know what will happen next at all. Normal difficulty is not impossible and not once did I get stuck on geometry. A few things are not apparent - that much is true. Granted, if they were, the game would not be hard enough. It's just right. Really. It's absolutely just right. Kudos to the dev team.  At one point I told my buddy I was really wasn't super scared anymore by about the middle of the game. BUT. I could not play for more than an hour or so or my heart would not slow down enough for me to sleep well. Too much tension. Then he said 'Isn't that what terrifying means?' He was right. Even when the horrific graphics no longer phased me, it was the sheer tension of the game that kept me in it's grip. That is amazing, and impressed me more than many AAA titles I've played in the past.",

Forget Amnesia. Amnesia is a little fart compared to Outlast. You're playing a journalist who has to investigate an empty psychiatry. But sooner or later you will find out that this psychiatrie is not empty and the battle for survival begins. There exist no weapons, only some beings in this psychatrie have weapons and they will use them against you. You can only run away and hide. Your camera is the only thing you have. Run, hide, film and hope. Outlast is one of the best Steam-games I have ever played so far. I can only recommend it to people who like horror-games and have the guts to play it. If you thought Amnesia is scary, then try this! It's the best horror-game existing so far !",

Here's what you do: just ignore that Recommended yes/no part; instead simply pick the option that leads to your personalized recommendation of Outlast and then just highlight the text below with your cursor!   Easy, right?! Nothing to it! Bob's your uncle! Here we go!       I am a horror fan, blood and guts don't scare me. I'm looking for the next big thrill and ain't no price or jump-scare stopping me!      Ur so cute omg! Play Outlast during mid-day lunch break, in a well-lit room surrounded by your noisy bros. Keep a casual attitude and act like you're showing off the game to your bros. Make Benny Hill noises during chase scenes to lighten the mood.       I'm a pessimistic person, a bit depressive and with a bleak outlook on things. I search the darker side of life but I'm really more into the subtle psychological narratives, dark and twisted mind states. Not so keen on jump scares.     You prolly want Amnesia - it's on your recommended list, of course. Outlast's story is a bit silly but the moment-to-moment gameplay will be tense, like a primal game of hide and seek. It will make you feel more alive and appreciative of life's sanity-filled moments. Get it on sale.       I rather consider myself a regular, socially-adjusted person; would like to get more into horror as this seems to be a catchy genre and looks like fun.     You're in luck! Buy Outlast and play it with your dates. Outlast is excellent for a romantic night-in. The saying should go 'Dinner and an Outlast chase' as far as I'm concerned; get that adrenaline pumping and you're in for some disturbing loving.      I'm a relatively sheltered person and I'm curious about the horror scene; would be cute to get in touch with my darker side.     You're a cutie-pie. Get Outlast right now, play it home alone at night, lights out, headphones on, it will be the start of something wonderful. Meet me for brunch after you finish it so we can share thoughts.       I'm like - SO into horror! I just looove Nightmare on Elm Street and that American Psycho thing was oh-my-god I could just see myself in it!     Oh boy you're gonna like this. Outlast is a very cheap investment for the success of your next Let's Play! series. Play it with your friends while downing Kahluas and blasting reggae on your surround system. Scream like a little girl when you see something moving in the dark so that your neighbours get some of that entertainment in their lives too!      I am a connoiseur of the finest disturbing horror. Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind the Sun and Saladfingers all bore me now, played all the Amnesia and Penumbra games back to back - still left me wanting more!      You are Chuck Norris. Outlast is actually kind of like your childhood so you will be quite bored. Give it a miss, Chuck.      Gore! Violence! Blood for the Blood God!     U're drunk. Play Outlast while getting drunk on a sunny Saturday morning. Wheee! Or instead go play GTAV or Assassin's Creed I DON'T KNOW.        I want to be the King and Queen of Cheese! Buy some Cheese Cleese?     You are the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. You are a mere mortal person wading through a meaningless, vapid, hostile existence. Play Outlast while watching Monty Python and simultaneously slapping yourself very roughly. Delight in feeling something, anything, even if it's mere discomfort.        I am a refined individual and enjoy the finer things in life; Cabernet Sauvignon, chess, Arcangello Corelli and 120 Days of Sodom. I like it when the red liquid comes out of people...     Save your time old chap, don't buy Outlast; life is your true playground, you can play in real life instead! With enough money and enough aristocratic flair, opportunities await you, old sport!       I unironically enjoyed The Human Centipede and am looking forward for some more fun weirdness!     You are the author of this review and you need to go to bed!  ",

There is some really freaky ♥♥♥♥ that goes down while playing this game, the lore of the game is actually very alluring and there are many documents to find scattered throughout the game detailing the experiments that happened and how the hospital plunged into chaos. Tons of other collectibles to find, different difficulty settings will definitely make for a few more playthroughs. I'd have to say this game is more then worth the $20, and if you can pick it up for $5 while on sale, I wouldn't give it a second thought. UPDATE: Just finished the game, took me roughly 10.4 hours to complete, with exploring and looking for as many documents/recordings I could find, and might I add, THIS IS THE BEST SURVIVOR HORROR GAME I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS! MORE, MORE! I will definitely be picking up Whistleblower, and will be looking forward to Outlast 2.",

            "review_text": "The Game  Outlast is incredible! It's a horrifying, psychologically-driven, intense game of survival as you, Miles Upshur, try to escape Mount Massive Asylum (and find out what happened there). What most of you are probably wondering is this: 'Is it scary?' YES, scary like no other game before it. It does use jump scare tactics, but don't let that discourage you. There's much more to Outlast's fear than that. One thing to note: the game's ending won't please everybody. It leaves a lot of things unexplained. I thought it was a well-done, open-ended conclusion, but no matter what you think of Outlast's ending, the journey there is definitely worth experiencing. 9.5/10.  The DLC  Outlast: Whistleblower is this game's pièce de résistance. I'm not sure if I'd say it's better, but it's definitely more well-done in many respects. Whistleblower helps to clarify a few key plot points that weren't explained in the main game. Here you play Waylon Park, the source within Mount Massive that tipped off Miles, the original game's protagonist, to the horrors going on within the asylum. Whistleblower works as both a prequel, showing what happens leading up to Miles' arrival at Mount Massive, and a sequel, showing what happens after the ending of the original game. And there's so much fear to be had in between those two points. I'd venture to say that Whistleblower is scarier than the base game, but its extreme use of graphic, unsettling content (moreso than the base game) doesn't sit well with some. You be the judge. The DLC also opens up some new plot points and then fails to even address a couple of them. This is my only problem with Whistleblower, but it isn't a huge one. If you're going to get the game, get the DLC along with it or you're going to missing out on a lot. Also: the ending to Whistleblower is great and answers the burning question we all had about the base game's ending (and then some). 9.5/10.",

The mazes of hallways with creatures patroling will force you to hone in on your stealth skills, as you will discover that Monsters/Creatures in this game, should be avoided at all costs. So be sure to move slow, peek corners, but be productive. While you're hiding in the shadows and having panic attacks, keep an eye out for batteries for your camera as you will need them alot more often as you progress through the game. Follow the Priest, Avoid the monsters, and escape the Psyco Doctor, or your life will be taken.  I highly recommend this game to any first person gaming fan along with horror fans.

Whether you're a gore-thirsty kind of person,want good scares,or both,this game has a bit of everything for every kind of horror fan The musical score by Samuel Laflamme is amazing and probably one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a horror game. The plot: There's an investigative independent journalist named Miles Upshur. After getting an email from an anonymous source(Waylon Park from Whistleblower),he is prompted to go into Mount Massive Asylum and uncover the truth behind Murkoff's intentions in the asylum. He then finds that Mount Massive has a darker story behind it than it may seem. The gameplay is great,with it involving carrying a camera around. This camera is important throughout the game because the camera has night vision that you can use to navigate dark areas. The characters are great,have good voice acting,and are effective in scaring you(especially your first time playing). In addition if you like the main story,there's DLC to the game,titled Whistleblower,and that expansion is as good as Outlast and is an amazing game as well :)  Overall this an amazing horror game that I recommend to everyone. 10/10 from me :) (UPDATE July 12,2014 6:00 PM: just beat the game my first time,on to Whistleblower :) ) (UPDATE August 31,2014 2:04 PM: just beat Whistleblower,and I honestly have to say both are amazing horror games,and probably my favorite game on Steam :) ) (UPDATE Jan 19,2015 6:14 PM: Just got sub 10 on Any%(9:59.78) :D) (UPDATE Feb 14,2015 5:47 PM: Speedrunning this game is ♥♥♥♥ing addicting)",

I had a great deal of fun simply watching the inmates perform their rituals along with what the game had to really offer, which was a lot of atmospheric scares. But more on that in a moment. I like the objective approach this game took with the inhabitants of Mount Massive, most of them are trapped in their own little world, either too broken to be in touch with reality, or too tortured to realize the reality around them. some even help you in their skewed and twisted ways. especially the main plot point: Father Martin; while he's the main reason you are trapped in the asylum as long as you are, he's also a good chunk of the reason you stay alive. a good chunk of the people want you dead for various reasons, so there's still your danger of getting skewered.  the game is rather atmospheric and relies a lot on opressiveness, capriciousness, and atmospheric and story tension to scare you a lot more than it uses jump scares. I never understood the rejection of jump scares: I know they are cheap, but sometimes the confusion and high intensity is necessary to break you out of the cautious lull you set yourself into. jump scares can be used to enhance an experience without relying on them and this game does a good job of doing that.  the story was a wonderful walk into the dark recesses of the human mind and it's depravity. I was almost convinced the scientists found something they shouldn't have with their deep hypnosis trials. it was a decently profound story with a great deal of necessary unanswered questions for the mind to ponder... untill the last fifteen minutes of the game.  once you decend the elevator into the laboratory, the game quickly changes from a deep psychological horror, to a cheap, clear-cut, action thriller. it's like they hired a different storywriter for the last part who thought any supernatural elements absolutely must be explained in full technicolor detail as to not let anyone believe in the silly ghost stories of the inmates. the game does an absolutely marvelous job of making you believe you just might be an inmate yourself. then strips it way with talk of nanomachines and a cheap as free chase sequence. truly, the last ending of Outlast completely tarnishes what should have been a great story to keep playing again and again.",

Most of the rest of the game I just spent getting angry and taking breaks from repeatedly dying while searching for 50 sets of keys, switches, and valves.

            "review_text": "Outlast is a great game and it really deserves the title of the scariest game of 2013. I really got scared many times in the game and after I really laughted at myself. The game really challenge you with dark areas and the way you react in a emergency moment when you see a lunatic in your front. The game has excellent graphics and I really loved the camera that we use and the night vision, it make it feel more scarier and I also thought that was really original. Althought the game is scary and you have a lot of fun, it also brings shocking scenes that contain violence. So before buying it, you need to be aware that you are not influenced on this type of violent game and neither believe in spirits or have some kind of disease that can influence your own life somehow like my first day playing I had nightmares. So really think to your self if you want this kind of entertainment for you.  Other way, I finished the game 4 hours and I had the impression that this lasted forever. It is not long and you get stuck many times on corridors not knowing what you need to do or where you need to go. The own terror makes you scared to move forward and get out of the areas you are hidden. In the game you cant punch or attack your enemies just run from them and defend yourself when they jump on you. You can also hide in places such as beds, shelfs, behind desks and others. It's really interesting and different how they planned the game, while running from a lunatic you can also look behind to see if someone is folllowing you. Also you can close doors to hold the enemies and put objects over it so it get harder to they brake the door.  You can film everything that happens on the game but after you cant see what you filmed that this was kind of dissapointing but the gameplay in general is way better than any horror game I ever played before. I totally recommend this game for the more prepared people that are accustumed to play scary games. My only concern is the ending of the game that was a lot dissapointing, more than anything. I won't spoil anything but, yes, the ending is horrile and unbelievable. But not considering that, don't disseast from buying it, the price total worth it and the gameplay and the art of the game is cool.",

Anyhow, this game wasn't particularily scary (except for the generic jump-scare) as it was stressful and had your pulse rise quite often. You often have to crawl through pitch black areas with only your camera's nightvision as your only source of light, and in many cases you also have to run from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out to ♥♥♥♥ you up at the same time. So it's more of a stressful game of making quick decisions in a short amount of time than pure creepiness. Especially if you play it on Nightmare difficulty as you only are allowed to have a maximum amount of 2 batteries compared to Normal difficulty's 10 batteries.  You end up mad-dashing through the majority of the game really, which is too bad as it doesn't leave room for enough exploring to satisfy me. Though the areas you had time to explore and really let them get to you had you in a tightened state all the way through. The music and soundeffects are really playing with your mind and when you think the threat is over it's often right around the next corner.  The few areas where you really could let your fantasy play and enhance the horrors lurking the dark halls of Massive Mount Asylum had you on your toes the whole time. You can almost feel your heart rate rise in sync with the protagonist's when you encounter the deranged events of this game.  All in all I'd say it was too stressful and had you miss out a lot of environmental exploration and general atmosphere as you most of the time dashed through the darkest places since your camera batteries were running out. But the places where you actually could play without the nightvision on really had you captivated and in a tight grip of fear!  I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants a beautifully decent horror game.",

            "review_text": "For the scare factor of this game, it's wonderful with the graphics, sounds, and all around atmosphere. I would have to say I thoroughly enjoy playing the game, although I will say some of the mechanics do get a little tedious(run turn on this thing, avoid getting caught, batteries, though I never ran out,) and the logic of the character you play is questionable, regardless I still enjoyed the experience.  I personally think finding the documents does aid in learning the story behind the asylum, and a nice challenge to give yourself to find them, I'm pretty sure I missed a few, but how many you get doesn't effect anything in the game really.  There is a certain point during gameplay where things don't necessarily scare you as much, but rather you get that adrenaline rush and thrill of hiding and evading whatever threat there is to you, similar to the thrill of hide and seek, or tag. Also it's designed to creep you out, or make you a little sick rather than scared.  I definitely recommend playing it alone and in the dark, with the fewest distractions possible.   If you speed run this game you can do it probably 6 hours first time and less, subsequent times. I took 10 hours overall my first time, including deaths and occasionally getting stuck stupidly. I personally think this game is worth the price, I did get it on sale for $7 I think, though the $20 makes sense because not every game can be cheap. ",

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: This reviewer has not played the Whistleblower DLC and therefore, their rating and comments on the game will not be accounting for this content. This review will contain no spoilers for neither plot nor story.  -TRIAL AND ERROR SIMULATOR -CHASE AND RUN AWAY SIMULATOR -♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI AND HIDING SIMULATOR  If you buy this game, prepare for sub-par gameplay. You have little to no influence over whether you survive an enemy encounter or not - as aforementioned, in obnoxious CapsLock, when you encounter an enemy, all you can do is run away - which is all well and good, right? 'Many games, especially of the Horror genre, do this', you say. The short answer would be yes, but the problem is that there is often ONE PATH to slip away from an enemy, often involving opening doors and closing them again, and it's IMPOSSIBLE to tell whether the door is actually locked or not, meaning you'll die 19 times to one enemy because you just happened to 'make the wrong guess' as to which way was the right one.  In general, you have very little control over the main character's actions; oftentimes, when tense action is happening, it involves first-person cutscenes of the events, with you just sitting there watching. In essence, all you have control over in this game is: -Movement (limited due to the aforementioned) -Picking up certain items (involving batteries for your camcorder, files/journals and certain progress-vital items) That's it. Quite dull.  'But Shape - why are you recommending this game then?' Because of three major points, which, in my opinion, easily compensates for the aforementioned flaws:  1) The plot: Many Horror games, and especially movies for that matter, have an incredibly dull and boring plot, and only get small points for cheap jump scares and similar tropes. This game is not one of those. At all. While there certainly are jump scares, the plot of this story is easily one of the most interesting, fascinating and most well-fleshed out ones I've experienced in any Horror game, being up there with classic Silent Hill, classic Resident Evil and the first Amnesia (note that I'm not comparing this plot to those games, it is in no way similar, it just delivers the same amount of quality). It puts you in the setting, ranging from fairly peaceful-looking to fishy to 'what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on?' to batshit insanity. And it does so in a very smooth way, with no try-hard scares and forced plotting like you occasionally see in other games of the genre.   2) The design: This is mainly focused on characters - both their aesthetic appearance and their personality. You are presented with a wide array of interesting characters, all done in a way where you're never quite sure whom to trust and whom to oppose. You're going to be falling through the cracks attempting to figure out who is good and who is bad - in other words, the characters are what presents this great plot in its own way: a complete and utter moral greyzone.  3) The atmosphere: The story unfolds in an old mental hospital, and you might think it's cliché, that you've seen this all before, that it is an overused setting. And you might be right - but assuredly, it has never been presented in the way Outlast manages to: grim darkness in every corner, the palette of clinical instruments and brushed steel paired with horrible gore and bloodstains, spiced with deranged freaks walking around everywhere, unpredictably, makes the raw experience of this game easily worth both your time and your money.   Overall, I would certainly recommend this game - if you manage to read this review while there's a sale, there is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE not to buy this game if you're a die-hard Horror fanatic like me, and you've got money in your pocket. And don't worry about my initial remarks about the gameplay: they're effortlessly overshadowed by the great story, you're in for.",

I guess something changed as I got older. After playing games like Alien: Isolation, I started enjoying the genre more. I got some strange kind of satisfaction out of being scared.   After reading so many positive things about Outlast, I figured it was worth a shot, especially at the discount price offered during the summer sale. So I bought it.  Outlast is not for the timid. I don't have a lot of experience with horror games, but it has to be the scariest game I have played. The fact that you are only equipped with a handheld camera really says it all. You do not face a horde of enemies, but you never know when they show up and when they do, all you can do is run or hide. This creates a tension and claustrophobic atmosphere that makes your visit to the asylum all the more nerve-wrecking.   Some of the scenes are extremely graphic, but I assume those who invest in the game are aware of this. The fact that the game world (the asylum) is so grotesque naturally adds to the horror. The game isn't very long (I finished it in about four hours), but the ride is worth every penny. Seeing as the experience is so terrifying, I doubt many people play it through without taking some breaks.   The graphics and the sound effects come together really well, lifting an already great game to a higher level. I believe the game is best experienced with headphones as it really immerses the player in the hellhole that is the asylum. However, being a bit of a wimp myself, I used the speakers occasionally. If it gets too scary, playing it during day time also helps!   Recommended for fans of the genre.  ",

The beginning chapters were its peak in my opinion. After I got confortable playing with the mechanics I realised you can speedrun through the monsters as you will be able to outrun or outmaneuver them (played on normal difficulty). So if you get like 30% to 40% into the game you wont be as scared of whats coming your way. I even got bored at few points where I just couldn't get past some bad guys.    That being said I still recommend it. If you are a horror fan I think you will be very pleased!   **Speaking from my experience with the game: one playthrough at normal difficulty (about 5 hours)**",

            "review_text": "I decided to pick this game up since it was on a deal during the Christmas Sale, and I also enjoy playing the occasional horror game. Normally horror games don't usually give me many frights and I thought Outlast would be exactly the same as the rest. However, Outlast definitely made me eat my words.  You play as the male protagonist Miles Upshur who, according to the start of the game, is a wimp when it comes to fighting. All you're equipped with is a camcorder. No guns, no knives, no weapons whatsoever. You're an unarmed, athletic journalist. Throughout the game you have to accomplish multiple goals in an attempt to escape from the asylum. Most of the time you'll have to sneak around in order to not get brutally murdered, and trust me it sure is brutal. If you get seen, the tense music will kick in, the adrenaline will start rushing around your body, and you'll make your character sprint and jump over obstacles as you head towards the nearest point of safety, whether it's in a locker, under a bed, or hiding under a desk. You'll also try to make sure you have enough batteries for the nightvision feature on your camera, which you can only find lying around. Otherwise you may end up being in the dark, waist deep in sewage, trying to find the way out of the sewer while an enemy, who will rip you apart if he finds you, is hunting you. Trust me, you don't want to have that problem, otherwise dying is probably the best option since it's the quickest way to get your batteries back.  In my opinion, trying to sneak around enemies while also trying to complete objectives is the biggest fear factor present the game. i'm sure for most people who have played this game, it's quite nerve-racking when you're trying to see where the enemy is, the music is slowly building up, you move round a corner to get a better view and 'BAM', the enemy is right in front of you. The panic will be there immediately, you'll turn around to go back into the room and attempt to duke the enemy in order to escape. As soon as you're safe, and the music has settled down, and there's a high chance that the above process may occur again, provoking the same response. There's also many jump scares present in the game, which adds to the fear factor already present when crouching around dark corridors with nightvision as the only light source present, with only your footsteps and breathing being the only sounds to accompany you.  I wouldn't say the story of the game is too complicated, but I wasn't really into the story that much. I did care for my character and for the events that caused this place to become what it is now, but the way to sort everything out, to 'fix' everything, didn't grip me that much (which is the only negative thing I can think of, other than some framerate issues which I think is due to my PC having exactly the minimum system requirements). The documents you find throughout the game will help you understand the backstory, and the good thing about them is they're not a long read, and I've got the same opinion for the notes that you're character makes. Even though I had to run the game on the lowest settings, the enviroment and graphics are very well done and I was certainly impressed considering Red Barrels is a company I've personally never heard of.  Overall, the game is very well done and certainly a great horror game. If you're a fan of horror games, then I highly recommend to buy this game, even if it's not on sale. Also a personal thanks to Red Barrels for making a fantastic game, and I can't wait to see the future DLC for this game.  Overall rating: 9/10",

I wish developers would stop confusing 'shock' with 'horror'. Still, this game has some real intrigue and I will try to play it to the end. There are some real clever parts; as if in the group of developers, one really understood good horror and had to fight the cliche' ideas of the others. No cheesy puzzles as of yet; that's a plus.

Later on, in high school, I discovered Silent Hill, which generally set aside jump scares for the sort of horror that surrounds you, and gets under your skin, until you have to turn the game off because you're so inexplicably freaked out. Outlast opts for a different kind of horror - the type popularized by Amnesia, where you are the victim in a horror film, and cannot fight back. It's a different beast from Resident Evil and Silent Hill altogether, though in the case of Outlast, it falls much more into the 'shock and panic' category. Unfortunately, like most horror experiences that rely on a select few mechanics, there are diminishing returns here. The first hour or so is fairly terrifying - I'll give it that. It reminds me of the first time I played Resident Evil 4, where I was mostly running for my life and dying every few minutes for at least the first two hours. After that, though - once you learn the game's mechanics - things get tedious fast. A typical segment of Outlast: 'Okay, new area. Hm. Nothing's jumped out at me for a few minutes. Oh, there we go - there's the false scare. Can't hurt me, so I must be getting close. Hey, I need to find this or activate this to open that door. Okay, part one, dude's gonna start chasing me. Okay, time to run away and hide. Oh. He killed me. Darn. Reload.' I don't know - maybe I'm just jaded, but Outlast didn't give me the self-soiling goodness I was hoping to find. Rather, I wanted to get through the game as quickly as possible. I'm also fairly certain the story won't stick with me like the Silent Hill series has. Still, it's a polished game (I only encountered one bug), and worth playing if you're looking for a brief descent into madness and gore.

            "review_text": "“The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown” - H.P. Lovecraft  Outlast scares me! Thus far I have been able to play it in 20 minute sessions, not for a lack of time, oh no, I am limited to 20 minutes because I lack the nerve to continue. Alone in a dark room, late at night, my nerve is quickly whittled away.  Last night I sat down at 8:45 Pm. I can reasonably play until 11:30. This time I leave the lights on in the room. My wife is sitting on the couch only six feet from me. I can do this!   The game play is simple. Walk around pick stuff up, click on buttons and open doors. Oh god, opening doors! I don’t know what’s on the other side, it could me nothing… but it could be… something! If there is something behind the door, I will run and hide… because… those are my options.   Run or Hide.  I have no gun, no strength, and no Fighting chance! I’m not Marcus Fenix, or Master Chief, hell I’m not even as tough as Luigi. I’m a reporter, a writer, an average Joe. This helplessness it what makes Outlast truly terrifying, helplessness in the face of the dark unknown.   The atmosphere is tense and the visuals are clean… well, not clean but crisp, or… Horrifying… Yah, Horrifying. For example, after I walk through a puddle of blood, I trail bloody footprints on the floor behind me.   I move through Mount Massive Asylum, carefully traveling from dim lamp to dangling florescent light. I’m forced to travel in the darkness. Terrible, terrible darkness, filled with the ruinous remains of the hospitals contents… and the hospitals staff… and the hospitals Patients… Patients, some dead… some living. Living patients, pushed past the point of insanity. They are now prone to mindlessly inflicting Violence on anyone they can find. If they can’t find anyone… then they will inflict violence on themselves. Violence has become their total being, and their only form of expression.   Darkness is an ever present pressure, forcing itself on me… an inescapable weight on my mind and soul. I’m given one tool to combat the darkness. My ever trusty video camera, with a built in night vision setting. At least… it’s trusty as long as I have enough batteries… which I don’t. I never have enough batteries. I am always looking for more, but while I look, I must conserve the precious juice I have. So when approaching a long dark room, I click my night vision camera on, take a quick glance around the room to get an idea of the layout in my mind. Then I turn off the camera… and I run. I do this again and again, always panicked, always terrified.   But it’s not just me that is terrified, it the reporter, the character…he becomes overcome with fear. As we run through the darkness we hear the splash of a puddle at our feat… oh god... It’s blood… we push forward his breath intensifying, becoming erratic… Short gasps, punctuated by trembling exhalations… we stumble over something lying in the blood… We don’t stop to see what it is, because I know what we’ll find… the source of the blood, and the reporter knows it too. His breathing is becoming so intense that it is affecting our vision; the screen sways with each rise and fall of his lungs. The world around us seems to tremble with a terrible fear.   Fear overcomes us. Both the reporter and I are paralyzed with it... unable to face the shadows at the end of the hall. We stand motionless for an eternity… unwilling to move forward… unwilling to face the horrible unknown that fill Mount Massive Asylum… I can’t take it.   I save the game and quit. The reporter is on his own. I abandon him to wait in that ever oppressive darkness… I look at the clock…  It mockingly displays the time as 9:04 Pm.  Sigh…",

            "review_text": "Excellent game!!! best Horror game i have ever played  A little background on the story: You are a journalist that has dealt with irregular stories and this is your next one. You were emailed by a person who goes by the name of whistleblower and you find your self in asylum were it apparantly has gone crazy. As you adventure through the game you find even more disturbing stuff than you would ever imagine... and the worst part you can't turn back and escape. You must film everything you can with your video camera and show the world this place.  The campaigns: Both the DLC and the normal campaign have really good story lines to them. They very nicely linked between eachother with the storyline. The campaign really is a winner from this game and it seems pretty believable to. Not many horror games can really have a great balance of horror and storyline but these guys got it just right. So it keeps the tension high and doesn't fall short for each stage of the game as you find out about the Asylum. Just keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through the game and sometimes you even fall off your seat. You never know whats around the next corner. I would recommend this for both the great thrilling campaign and for those unscarable people who would like a freight.   Now the actual scare factor: This game envolves mostly jump scares and very intense chases (mostly chases). But as you encounter new characters and enemies you have to use the environment to your advantage not many horror games do this very well but this game achieved this with ease and nicely. The jump scares arnt cheesy either, which is a good thing, so it is very orignal with its jump scares. The chases are all ways very intense and have lots of tension for you to survive. Some times you must be chased to escape a zone which may seem hard for some players but adds another challenge to the game for me. Escaping can envolve being chased and moving objects at the same time.   Controls: The crontrols are very straight forward wasd keys to move around and mouse to look around. Tab can bring up a menu allowing to access collected files and your personnel diary that you log into whenever a significant event is caught on camera. Hold left shift with wasd keys is to run. spacebar to jump and Ctrl is to crouch. Clicking can allow you to interact with objects like document and doors etc. Right click allows to record with the camera and pressing the f key while in this mode allows you to turn on night vision and waist battery life. Only in night vision mode you can consume battery life so in theory you will have to find batterys to power night vision which is used a lot. Clicking on a battery interacts with it and picks it up to be stored. Pressing the r key can replace your current battery with a new battery (only do this once battery is out of charge).  Graphics: The graphics really toped off the game and made it look really nice and sweat. As long as you have a great cumputer with a good graphics card and enough ram, like me, you can play with all of the settings to the max for a stunning looking game. With the graphics settings to the max the game flourishes visually and looks divine. Even with a less great computer you can get maximum settings with a little bit of lag. Normally even with the settings at about medium it can look just as good. Maximum settings just makes the image look crisp with the tiny details. Depends how you would like to play with your computer.   Summary: Excellent game with a divine campaign and the scariest characters. Also with graphics that look stunning anyone would enjoy this game. I highly recommend this and would give it a score of 9.5/10.  Coded and desgined so well.   Hope you guys take my word and buy the game in the end. Opinion comes down at the end of the day for if you like this game or not.  Enjoy gaming!!!",

This is a stealth-based game and you are /completely/ defenseless -- the only options you have are to run and/or hide from the mental patients known as The Variants. The only item you have on your person is a camcorder which has night-vision capability, which you will need to utilize quite a lot to maneuver throughout the poorly-lit asylum. Of course, this requires battery power, those of which can be found scattered around in various places in the game -- use them wisely.  As terrifying as all hell as this game is, it's rather cliche as far as horror goes, and it's repetitive and very predicatble with the Variant encounters; you can usually always tell when an encounter is about to happen, sometimes just by simply surveying the area. Regardless, I still get scared because you have to move around through the darkness stealthily, having poor judgement on where the gore-lusting nutjob is lurking. This game also has its share of pop-out scares, which I hate and give me a heart attack every time.  The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. The game was inspired by mental asylums and real cases of mental illnesses, so the level design feels very genuine and authentic. The unnerving dark ambient soundtrack is excellent and really helps compliment the atmosphere of the game, There is heavy detail and lots of corpses, blood and guts lying around everywhere -- I often find myself staring at them because of how detailed they are.  Outlast has truly impressive graphics, very detailed sound effects, and is overall very dark and immersive. If you're looking for a scare, this game is pretty brutal.",

It has a few things in common with games like Amnesia, where the inability to kill your enemies really hightend the experience and makes it so much more of a dreadfull joy.   The videos on youtube does focus on jumpscares but the game is so much more than that, allthough it does use jumpscares masterfully (even better than games like Dead Space 2).  In this game they really put some effort into the characters you meet and interact with, even for the ones who basically acts like a part of the background and the 'little' trick, adds a LOT to the atmo of the game.   The puzzles are not too clever but they work and seems logical, even thought they from time to time seems a little too convinient. but hey, its entertainment and fiction!  ..nuff said, get it!  9/10",

Since Miles doesn't have any fighting skill whatsoever, the entirety of his trip is spent running away from the twisted, bloodthirsty inmates, collecting documents and recording events. The main tool of Outlast is in fact your video camera, which makes with an infrared vision function which is vital to navigate the most darkened areas of the asylum.  If you have played Amnesia: The Dark Descent, then you are fully aware of what is in store for you. It's worth mentioning however that, while Outlast gets the scare factor, sound and level design and graphical horror mostly right, the game is rather easy to overcome and can turn out less frightening after a while. It's very easy to dodge most of the enemies encounter just by moving around with a low profile and taking advantage of the shadow, moreso during the proper chase scenes. Even special enemies like Christ Walker (who aren't hindered by closed doors and have an erratic patrol pattern) are very easy to avoid. Outlast is also very generous when it comes to the batteries for your camera (which are pretty much mandatory to advance in the dark areas of the asylum).  Arguably, jump scares and the unpredictable NPCs (who may or may not be aggressive towards you once you approach them) are Outlast's strongest suits as an horror game.",

This game had me so immersed that when I would make too loud of a noise in game I felt my heart pounding and yelled 'NO NO NO WHY SO MUCH NOISE, QUIET DOWN!!!!'. This game made me think I was actually in an insane asylum and made me see some strange things afterwards. Incredible ambience and enviroment.  2. Graphics (+1.5) This game has some of the best graphics I've seen. Im running then on an old Sapphire 6970 at 60FPS just fine and it honestly, looks better than Crysis 2 (Not 3, but 2 yes.)  3. Old style Gameplay (+ or - .5 depends) If you're used to tutorials, and things being obvious and blatent in games nowadays, like most are, then this game might now be for you.

Plays very much like a found footage film. You'll never feel safe in Mount Massive Asylum. Just when you get comfortable, the story will take a turn for the worst.  Visually the game is impressive. It's not so much in the overall sense of graphics, but the attention to detail is excellent. No gore in this game looks the same. Everything helps to build a sense of dread in the environment in Outlast.  The audio is excellent. Whether it be the murmuring of harassed patients or the fear soaked hyperventilation of the main character, Outlast uses the sound to its most horrific benefit.  The gameplay is great. The designers definitely know how horror game players think and react. Jump scares play on your predictability and level design forces the player into uncomfortable situations of being exposed. If that weren't the worst of it, the maze like structure of the asylum turns on the player when they're forced to flee from an enemy into unexplored areas. Just when you think you have this game down, they change it up on you.  If you love horror titles, don't think; just get this game.",

Now I played only on the normal difficulty but I imagine the harder the difficulty the less batteries for your camcorder AKA your source of light in the dark are spread around. Now minus that I did come to a part where I had no batteries and I could barely see anything at all, I nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants and shut the game off. Other than that there are some scenes with full out nudity, thank Gods for the terrible lighting or I would have saw what hangs between my legs. Now overall Outlast is a great game, it lacks a large soundtrack but the silence can be scary at times. Depending on how brave, fast and smart you are this game can last anywhere from 4 to 12 hours in gameplay. Now a big issue with this game like all ones it the main kinds of times you get scared are from scripted jump scares, like all Horror games these happen sadly. As I remember there are only a handful of the scripted ones but the 'hunting' parts of the game are horrid. (Horrid in a good way.) The hunting sequences are when an AI (Weather a standard enemy or a 'boss') is in the area where you need to solve a puzzel or get a key etc. etc. patrols around looking for you usually in the pitch black. Overall the game is great for it's time and deserves a 9/10 and a ♥♥♥♥ your pants seal of approval.",

It's AAA graphics and immersive story was enough to restore my faith in the horror genre.  And I'll be honest with you, I'm that guy who watches horror movies all the time and makes fun of them for not being scary and the scares being to 'Predictable' and most of the time they are. But Outlast was a whole different experience for me.  I was at the edge of my seat throught most of my playthrough, even during my second and third playthrough some of the scares still got me.  There was something about the gaming that was addicting almost, even after my multiple completions of the game, I was never satisfied. In fact, I loved this game so much that I made it my mission to get every single achievement, and if you check my profile. You can see that I suceeded :)  This game is one of the best in its genre, and I feel that this should be the benchmark for a 'Good' horror game.

The bad guys didn't bother me in there. I was tempted to stay.   The immersion level of the game is amazing. The sounds and sights are cued so very well it's impossible not to get swept up in the nerve-wracking tension. In addtion to the expected ambient sounds of an old building riddled with who-knows-what monstrosities, the main character also makes noise. His camera makes noise. He breathes heavy when he runs or gets surprised by something. He makes noise when he bumps into things.   The game jumps between normal vision, camera vision and night camera vision, dictating the visual experience you get. The night vision is especially creepy to me and very true to what I've seen on paranormal hunter reality shows. All very sense-convincing. Only thing that's missing is the smell of dust and fear-sweat in the air.   Excellent game so far.

My logic with shelving it was that, yes the game is terrifying, but I anticipated that the game would continue to have this pattern right up to the end: Play the game, be completely terrified, die. Go back to last checkpoint. Less terrified now. Die. Back to last checkpoint. Game isn't scary anymore because you know what's going to happen. Advance to next stage. Rinse and repeat.  I was wrong.  The reason I was wrong is that there are a lot of checkpoint saves. A lot. The game saves really frequently. I am so glad I finally decided to just beat this game, because it's about the most disturbing and one of the scariest games I've ever played. Like, holy crap guys. Why are you even reading this review when you could be buying, installing and playing this game with the lights out and headphones in. I wish I could wipe my memory of this game, just so I could play it again.    The DLC 'Whistleblower' is just as terrifying as the main game, but even more disturbing. It's about half the length. Definitely worth it.   Start out on hard mode, as normal mode just means the normal enemies can hit you 5 times with a baseball bat with a nail in it before you die, which pulls you right out of the immersion because that's ridiculous. Just don't get seen or hit, which is completely managable.",

Although there are scenes of terror already seen, it's a good game. Obviously, horror games may scare some people very easily with one body that falls on the head after they opened a door. Instead, there are other who will find this game boring. In latin 'De gustibus' or 'personal tastes'. A protagonist armed only with camera and his legs to run, it's certainly distressing that he can't do anything to fight enemies. But the game can offer much. It costs isn't high.  Location fantastiche, grafica ottima, sensazione di paura e ansia costante durante l'arco di tutto il gioco. Seppur presenti gameplay e scene di spavento già viste è pur sempre un buon titolo. Ovviamente i giochi horror possono spaventare alcuni molto facilmente anche facendogli cadere un cadavere sopra la testa dopo aver aperto una porta oppure risultare assolutamente banali e noiosi da chi, anzichè scappare da un grassone invincibile che gli spezza la colonna vertebrale ci vanno addosso senza paura. Con un protagonista armato di solo una telecamera che funziona a batterie e le proprie gambe per correre è sicuramente angosciante non poter fare altro che scappare di fronte ad ogni possibile minaccia. Ma il gioco può offrire molto. Per chi si vuole avvicinare al brand Outlast è un titolo valido che costa anche poco.  Vote/Voto: 7,5/10",

What I found interesting was that    Whisteblower's story starts before the main story, then eventually catches up, and even within Whistleblower's story, there are references to the main story; so the whole thing does hook together.    So it is wise to play the two stories back to back.  Overall this game was an incredible addition to my collection and I will definitely be playing it again very soon.",

And let me tell you, some areas are total blackness. While it has a couple jump scares, that isn't where the developers invested the scare factor into. It's more about the atmosphere, which is the kind of scary game I prefer. You don't get desensitized to the scare factor in this game like you do in those with jump scares.   Another odd but winning feature in this game is you aren't alone as you trek through the asylum. I don't mean to spoil anything, but it really creates a unique experience as you squeeze around other inmates. You get a glimpse at what your character could become if he can't find a way out. Nothing huge, but something that stuck out to me as I played.   While my favorite game in Amnesia (shocker, I know), it isn't fair to compare this to Amnesia. The two were both atmospheric, but other than that completely different. All in all, this game delivers. I can't wait to play it on the harder difficulties.",

            "review_text": "A tense, scary, gory, atmospheric descent into an insane asylum as a curious and courageous journalist to uncover the truth about what is happening inside the ominous and brooding Mount Massive Asylum, armed with only a video camera with night vision, and your wits and quick thinking.   You must survive the encounters with the asylum patients, navigate the ransacked labyrinth of the building’s interior, stomach and press on through your lingering foreboding, and find out Mount Massive Asylum’s dark secret and escape with your life, and the story to tell the entire world.   The game clocks in at 5 to 6 hours, has collectables to find, and has many difficulty modes, there’s even the obligatory setting where if you die once you have to restart the whole game. I would definitely recommend picking this game up for 10 dollars or under if you are a horror fan. Go to the website CheapShark and price alert this game for under 11 dollars. Good graphics, interesting characters, tense gameplay, lots of gore, and a pretty decent story. You will go from peaking around a corner watching a hulking mental patient try to find you using your night vision setting, to sprinting away from enemies with your heart pounding looking for a place to hide, to jumping out of your chair from the inevitable jump scares, to slowly walking through creepy environments drenched in gore trying to piece together the story, to watching pure insanity unfold before your eyes.   Solid 8/10. If you remember to allow yourself to be scared, you will be scared. No game or movie can scare someone who is constantly thinking “this isn’t scary, this is a joke, I’m gonna run through and skip and sing.” You have to stop, give yourself permission to be scared, and soak up the atmosphere and tension. You will have a good time. Play by YOURSELF, at night with all the lights off, with the sound turned up, and with no distractions nearby to take you out of the experience.   Red Barrels has a good formula here, they just need to expand on it. Give the players more freedom of choice in how to progress through a level, a greater level of interactivity with the environments, randomize the events and enemies more, and perhaps add in more puzzles that make you think.   I think Red Barrels also has a multiplayer experience on their hands. Have one team be the insane inmates, the other team be the journalists / survivors trying to escape.   One person could be the large butcher (or two people could be butchers so one doesn’t just get trolled the entire time), the other people are the survivors trying to survive. Butcher can only walk slowly until he catches sight of a journalist for long enough than he can chase until sight is broken, or for a short while after sight is broken. Hide in lockers, vents, barricade doors, hide under tables, beds, squeeze between objects. It would be very fun. Many different brutal execution animations are welcome of course. Make it so he can only turn slowly as well unless chasing so people don’t spam looking everywhere.   Or you could have the chase sequences, where the journalists are being chased by the smaller more agile inmate team. Close and barricade doors and make it to the end without being caught, other non-aggressive inmates could be used to block the aggressive ones.   Would love for them to try something like this, and add in advanced functionality. Like free moving objects instead of scripted door barricade locations, make objects have realistic weight, instead of everything being so static. Inmates could cut off the power, if you trip you could smash the lens of your camera, add in back up flashlights, be able to set traps for the inmates. Recreating those single player moments in multiplayer would be very awesome. Everybody taking turns scrambling up into a vent screaming while the inmate team is breaking down the door behind them, the last journalist is caught and torn apart.   Everybody hears the inmates crouch walking behind them in the vents, jump down and seal the vent then proceed to sprint down the hallway while being chased, vaulting over things, one journalist’s keyboard cuts out and he is eviscerated. You could even have an A.I. director player who could turn on and off lights, spawn in non-aggressive inmates (dead players take control of these guys?) to get in the way of either team (could grab onto players, get pushed aside by journalists, or stabbed by aggressive inmates), help or hinder the journalists in realistic ways by spawning in things, be able to create jump scares in real time for the players to run into.   Jump across the final broken floor to the safe room door, the last player has the inmate team hot on his heels. The journalists debate whether sealing the final door now and playing it safe sacrificing their friend, or closing the doors behind him at the last second, he just barely makes it in with the knives and blades scraping at the door. These are just my ideas, I love multiplayer. Multiplayer horror would be great.   If you’re reading this Red Barrels, make it happen! Thanks for the great game, would love to see multiplayer. I’ll be reviewing Whistleblower next.   Thanks for reading this review, hope you decide to buy this good game. Stay safe when you are OUT there trying to LAST. ;)",

It's not because I'm scared or anything but because most horror games are boring. However, this game isn't like the other games in the same genre. Unlike most Slenderman games, which involve collecting lost pages and lots of running from Slenderman, playing Outlast doesn't seem pointless. The game's story and lore are really interesting. It's not that scary anymore after you've spent more than three or four hours in the game, although it's still fun and it still gives that weird creepy feeling.",

ANyways the only problem I actually had with this game was in a few parts enemies could get you stuck and pretty much instantly kill you which was kinda annoying, but it didnt happen that much. I played on normal and with controller so I cannot comment on mouse and keyboard options, most games, if they have the option, I will use my Xbox 360 controller. If you want a horror game, and a good one at that then pick up this game, in fact it is on sale, midweek sale, I got it from Humble Bundle for 5 dollars and it was well worth it, and still worth the 20 dollars at full price. I also grabbed the DLC during the midweek sale, so I am going to move onto that and see how good it is. I highly highly reccommend good headphones for this game, helps make the horror really come home, headphones in general will give you a better expeirence, lights on or off it will scare you probably. 10/10",

While other similar games such as Amnesia are psychologicaly disturbing to the player, Outlast has the immediate effect of scaring your wits out, as your only option is to run away from the pshyco freaks that are trying to murder you and slice you with various weapons.  Outlast is one of the most popular games for a reason, as its unique horror scenario in a horror psychiatric hospital (a horror fanatic's wet dream) is perfectly well crafted, and leads to a riveting story. While the story is very linear and does not let you explore the hospital at your own will, the charm of the story and its various characters make the entire experience worthwhile. Some of the characters throughout both the original game and the DLC will make you remember their names in awe, as you remember their intense moments of horror and shock all well as some of their most popular lines of dialogue.  Outlast and the WhistleBlower DLC is one of the greatest combination of any video game to date, and I would like to congratulate Red Barrels on their wonderfull work.",

However, not in the sense of being scary. I have played games that are scarier than this - and the horror part of this is very repetitive after around an hour of play time.   The reason why I recommend this game is because it has a very good story line. Although it seems you are doing the same thing over and over again, there are lots of different parts/rooms to the game and lots of different people/things trying to kill you. Each killer has their own things that they say and their own way of killing you. I have to say, my favourite killer is the one that shouts 'MINE' all the time. He was great...   I'd say this game is definitely worth the money, and although it may seem scary at the start and you want to stop playing, I suggest you keep playing, for eventually you'll get used to the horror and you'll be more focused on the objectives rather than the amount of doodie you'll be making in your underwear. :)  The graphics in this game are spectacular! Lighting and visual effects are stunning and the use of emotion on characters is really intriguing - you can notice the long amount of thought put into the characters to make sure that both their body and facial expressions were convincing.   The monsters/people in this game are really unique in their own ways and this horror game is definitely the beat horror game I have played so far. Outlast 2 is out soon and I can not wait one bit.   The Whistleblower DLC was - I find - the best part of the game. It really adds so much more to the game - it's basically like another version of outlast, a new outlast game entirely. The DLC is very impressive and I absolutely recommend it!",

Amnesia slacks a little in graphics compared to this game. Outlast is very realistic. The game takes place in an old creepy insane asylum and the doctors running it are said to be doing some 'questionable' experiments there. As an investigative journalist you go to find out what's going on, armed only with a video camera. When you get inside you find getting back out isn't so easy.

            "review_text": "In Outlast, you are investigative journalist Miles Upshur. You've decided to act on an anonymous tip, and so you set off to explore Mount Massive Asylum, an old and decrepit building that has recently been re-opened by the Murkoff Corporation. The nightmares and horrors that lie in wait are beyond anything that you can imagine, and your only possible way out is through hordes of deranged mental patients who've fallen victim to hellish experiments and medical torture. Armed with only a camcorder that has night vision capabilities, you must survive.  Set in a first-person point of view, Outlast is very much like a playable 'found footage' horror movie; most of your time will be spent looking through your trusty camcorder, which will help you navigate immensely dark areas. Crazed lunatics and mental patients litter the tight corridors and open expanses of the game, most of which have some sort of deformity; be it mutilated flesh, or stumps where a limb should be. Many are harmless, and will chatter nonsensically, while others are out for blood... your blood. There are a small handful of primary bad guys that you will repeatedly encounter, all of whom are utterly gruesome and terrifying in their own way. You're no fighter, so you must run, hide, and outsmart your foes in order to navigate beyond them.  Much of the interaction between you and the enemies in the game consists of a mixture of chase and stealth sequences. An enemy will burst in out of nowhere, and it's up to you to find the nearest place to duck into; a locker, under a bed, behind a shelf. Sometimes the only thing that you can do is keep running. While these intense moments will make your heart palpitate, and the hair on the back of your neck stand up, near the end of the game it really gets both redundant and expected. Found a key? Well, I guess I'll go hide in this conveniently placed locker because Mr. Huge Pecks is going to come stomping down the hallway any second now! This is really the only downfall of Outlast, and honestly with the deep atmosphere and immersive graphic quality of the game itself, it hardly takes away from the scare factor that the title has. Not to mention, each of these foes has a lavish background to indulge in if you take care to read the collectible documents and notes.  While exploring the gore-soaked, entrail-laden rooms, hallways, and basements of Mount Massive Asylum, you will come across various documents and camcorder notes (if you have your camcorder on during certain events) that will give a large insight into the storyline of Outlast. It seems that the facility that you're exploring has been used for religious surgeries and scientific experiments that have turned many patients into unholy abominations. Many of the ill have been subjected to deranged forms of hypnosis, which has caused their mental state to deteriorate rapidly. Even the doctors have gone rabidly insane. It would be a travesty to suggest that this title relies on jump scares, but the ones that are placed sparsely throughout the gameplay are completely unexpected and scream inducing.  The biggest majority of Outlast centers around navigating from one area to the next, although the game never feels like a walking or key-finding simulator. There are a few puzzles to solve, which usually involve turning a couple of things on or grabbing a couple of items to help you progress; typically while avoiding an enemy that's filled with bloodlust. While this may sound tried, true, and typical for so many horror games, Outlast just does it the way it should be done. This title really brings out all of the stops with AAA quality graphics, detailed atmospheric lighting, memorable characters, constant environment and AI interaction, an extraordinarily suspenseful soundtrack, excellent enemy AI, and some of the most dense atmosphere of any horror game that I've ever experienced; and trust me, I've played nearly every horror game that there is.   Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Outlast is one of the greatest survival horror games since Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4. I would go as far to say that as of this moment in time, it is the best modern horror survival title. No, you don't fight. No, you don't have a gun. You're a regular journalist, and you must use your wits to survive truly insane, deadly enemies. If you're like me, and you love games that are dripping from every corner with blood and gore, boast noteworthy bad guys, have a captivating storyline, and pull you in with an impenetrable atmosphere, then Outlast is the horror game for you. Also consider picking up the Whistleblower DLC, which is a phenomenal prequel addition to the main game.   Rating:  5.0/5.0  - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.",

Despite the fact, I have purchased it, after already playing some of it on the xbox !!   Because it will scare the crap out of you, and why would I wish for you too experience such a fright. This said i cant wait to let some family members try it out and sit back and watch. It does at times calm down and you start too then release that the absence of any ability too fight back becomes annoying, and at times stages which require a little puzzle solving or repetitive respawning in order to advance further also gets right up your nostrils.  Honestly and truthfully, at this stage i have zero idea why i purchased it, the best explantion i can give you lot is that it was something i noticed whilst adding content too my wishlist, thought about, figured why not...  Will I play it again, yes, but not very often, I like my sleep and also prefer not too have too watch cartoons before getting into bed at night !!",

            "review_text": "First off I would like to say that I've never left a review before so I apologise if this is written badly. Onto the review! When I saw the trailer for this game before it came out I got really excited and the last time that happened was with Fable so I thought that meant something. The tension and fear really came through in the trailer and made it seem like this game would really be something special. Which it is to a point I suppose. The use of the night vision function on your camera is something that I personally hadn't seen before and it works. But it's a pretty cheap way of trying to add fear into a game that becomes repetitive really quickly. I'll admit that the beginning of the game is good, the first hour I enjoyed but aren't we all like that with any game? I'm just going to make a list of Good and Bad points.  GOOD: - The lighting is good but to make more use of the NV there are some areas that are needlessly dark. - If you look down you can see your feet! (I'm being serious, I like that.) - When you're close to a door frame or a wall you put your hand up against it like you actually would in the real world. - Your night vision isn't infinite which forces you to be careful with it. - The jump scares work well for the first hour. - Your character actually shows fear by breathing heavily/shallower. - The camera display is the HUD so you get deeper immersion. - The graphics are actually pretty nice and run well on a laptop, which is what I have.  BAD: -The lighting is good but to make more use of the NV there are some areas that are needlessly dark and they're so dark that if you happen to run out of batteries for your camera you can't see anything at all. It would be nice if you at least had a lighter to give you some sense of direction instead of fumbling around in the dark.  - Your night vision isn't infinite which forces you to be careful with it. (this ties in with the above point) - Even though you can't see in the dark apparently the enemies can. Perfectly. They have night vision built into their eyeballs or something. - If an enemy does decide to attack you guess what you do. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I get that you're not a warrior and this isn't Resident Evil but do you really have to do nothing AT ALL. Yes you can run away, I get that, but why do you stand there like an idiot. You don't even raise your arms to shield your face as you try to get away, you literally just stand there and take a beating. - Wow this is a repetitive game: 'Pull some levers first.' One hour later. 'Pull some levers first.' being an example. - Your character knows that there will be an enemy before there even is one and lets you know by breathing really heavily because he's scared. Too heavily. You can barely even hear the enemy walking around and considering that half of knowing where they are is by hearing them. Well... - A room covered in blood does not equal fear. We're not in the 90's anymore. - You don't actually seem to care very much about what's going on in general. Pretty sure most people would be talking to themselves about how ♥♥♥♥ their situation is. - Why are these people walking around looking for someone? Who are they looking for?   Overall I wouldn't recommend this game but I do want to find out what happens at the end, however I'll probably just watch a Let's Play to find out.",

            "review_text": "Although the visuals and atmosphere of this game are great (I especially love the night vision camera effect), I didn't enjoy it very much.  I find the 'adaptive sound' stuff kind of annoying rather than evocative; for example: the suspenseful strings and heavy breathing when enemies draw close often alerted me to an enemies I hadn't even seen yet (even through walls!), breaking all sense of immersion. Similarly, more than once I was trying to listen for footsteps, but couldn't hear them over the incessant orchestra following me around the building.  Also, I understand the whole 'helplessness' thing and how it adds to the tension, but it feels really forced to me. Apparently I'm playing a man so feeble that he can't even try to shove someone out of his way, let alone pick up a chair leg and swing it. Despite this, he's athletic enough that he can vault over desks without trouble and climb along ledges by his fingertips. I guess he's just philosophically opposed to violence, because he's certainly not incapable of defending himself.  If you don't mind playing along with the strange horror tropes and glossing over the inconsistencies, I'm sure the visuals and atmosphere alone make this worth playing; I didn't get far enough to evaluate the story, but it seemed fairly interesting so that's a strong point as well. For me the gameplay just feels too fake and forced to really appreciate the more artistic aspects of the game. I'm not trying to say it's a bad game (it seems very well made in fact) but it seems likely that other people might find it annoying for the same reasons and I want them to have some warning.",

However the only part of the game I enjoyed is whistleblower they really went all out with it was forced to quit because I got so scared but its as short as the real game for 9$ which is how much the real game should have cost!

It continues and introduces you to some very memorable characters that you will wish werent as memorable Chris Walker (the one annoying fatty who ends up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off after the first 5 times you have to run and find a key while the fatass chases you). The Twins (aka the ♥♥♥♥♥ bros who kill you too fast after a cheap jump scare) and the doctor dude, 'Father Martin' and 'Billy': all who dont even make sense till the last 5 minutes of the game literlly.'  Now that we have the amazing characters explained, we can get into what makes this game soooo 'scary'. First off theres the repeated mechanics that happen every other 'mission' or 'chapter'.  There is: -Find a Key or something similer to get you to the next place that you dont even understand why you want to go there, all while being chase by 1 (sometimes more, of the amazing cast) -Next is basically the same thing only NOW you have to turn a lever or valve thing GENIOUS GAME MECHANICS 10/10!!  In the end Outlast cant decide if it wants to be a survival game, a horror game (survival horror??) or even a Sci-Fi game (yes thats what the end makes it look like so yeah...) So no I dont recommend this game especially for the price tag, maybe 5$ when its on sale and your bored but be careful you might just not feel like playing it after the first 3 fun little missions!

In tense moments (Something is chasing you), you have basically 2 choices, run left or run right. You can also hide in lockers or under beds. Usually if you choose the wrong way when being chased (It's completely impossible to know before hand which way is a dead end) you will just die. You'll then replay that section of the game knowing that you should not run that way. This is basically the entire game. I'm getting fairly sick of the horror genre, where it's considered innovation to remove all forms of input with the world. I would call this game an interactive movie where you are forced to rewatch segments at a time.",

Story was decent but nothing truly intriguing/unpredictable + the whole 'yey, game is about to end... no.. wait.. there's more' was a bad thing in my opinion. I wanted the game to end on a few occasions but it felt like it has to drag the plot on and on and on. Apparently I finished the game in 8.4 hrs of being in-game, I fell like it should be 6 or something like that.   In the end, I finished it just for the sake of finishing it, having lost the interest around the 3rd-4th hour. I will also add that the first hour or hour and a half of the game is just... you've guessed it.. boring.  That said, that's my personal opinion and you might just find this game brilliant. Me?

Spoiler warning: I was hoping at the end when the player discovered the science lab that this game would escalate into an action/horror fps, reminiscent of fear or half-life, but that was wishful thinking. I feel like this could have been a really good game if they gave you weapons at this point and made it a few hours longer, and cut the start of the game back a few hours.",

Level design is nice, graphically the game look decent (nothing mind blowing mind you, but not bad at all). Sadly the actual gameplay itself is a let down.  The first part of this game is trying to get used to the vomiting inducing headbobbing which cannot be turned off. Seriously I think these guys want to make you sick from just the nauseating camera movements more than anything else. If you easily suffer motion sickness avoid this one, it's worse than any other headbob in any other game ever.  After that this is one long boring game of suprise hide and seek. Enter an area, suprise, run and hide and then move and try not to get caught. Time, after time, after time. And sometimes thw mecanic doesn't even work, some guys will ALWAYS find you no matter what you do. That may be intended, but not knowing what guys will and won't is kinda cheap. Also, some times it takes the AI forever to get a guy to move out of a room. A couple times i had to reload because an enemy would just stand there not moving after he entered the room you were hiding in. Playing hide and seek with these zombie upgrades get painfully boring after a bit.  Once in awhile you get the 'Just kidding! Ha ha we tricked you that isn't gonna work but we fooled you!' A cheap mechanic. Sometimese it's getting a key, or losing your camera making you backtrack, and they come back sley for the purpose of extending gameplay. NO OTHER REASON. The devs troll you with a lot of misleading solutions just tomake the game longer. Open this and get that, easy. Nope, now we just made it harder. Run around a whole bunch to find it and now come right back here.  I mentioned short battery life, about 3 minutes per battery. Battery power is only used in the dark and this game is mostly dark. 10 batteries max and I never had more than 4 at a time. Not enough laying around, and some dark areas will take you 20 or 30 minutes to fnd your way through. I was lost in one area in near complete darkness for almost 2 hours. It took looking through several walkthroughs to find where I needed to go, and that was after using the unlimited battery cheat because I had no batteries and couldn't see anything at all. Honestly this game was no more or less scary (all the scares are jump scares by the way, not true horror here) regardless of battery management so why battery management was included at all is beytond me.  Enemies are basically unbeatable zombie looking things that your either hide from or run from. Youu character is completely powerless to fight back which is another horror trope I am getitng sick of in games.  The overused trope of finding collectibles for background information (this time documents from teh lab and notes you camcorder collects) is here adding nothing new to gaming at all. Combine that with a ridiculous ending that concludes after an annoying simulation of having to move a guy with a broken leg at a slow pace for half a mile as he stumbles in pain ever few feet. Real fun that one was.  Ultimately even the ending was unsatisfying. No shocking end, no relief, no story closure. Truly disappointing. I honestly don't think it made any sense. No build, no climax really. Just, this happened and what? Why? Uh, ok whatev.  This could have been a great game, but it's scares rely on only jump scares, it's hide and seek mechanic is over used and boring as hell, and it's need to constantly backtrack you make playing a chore rather than a fun experience.   I might gve this a thumbs up is they'd just get rid of that nauseating headbob because it's absolutely rediculous to use period. Still, that would have made this game only a marginally better esperience. WIth all teh talk of ths game I was expecting a deepp experience with clever game play. I got none of that.",

I did enjoy the middle of the game more but the mechanics made it very 'samey'.  When I died the first time I felt like; this is going to be hard - only to respawn at a point just moments prior to my demise, with no penalty. This utterly removed all feeling of danger for me. I proceeded to spend the rest of the game running about, not really caring much. This drastically depreciated the quality of my experience.  The 'patrol routes' and mechanics to the enemy AI also didn't 'do it' for me. When I learned that the best way to avoid a pursuer was to run into a room, do a quick lap or two, run out and then hide in the nearest locker - nothing could redeem this game for me.  There was some really nice features to the game like how you can see your character when you look down, or your hand placement against walls or the floor when crawling. This really impressed me, and the brief time I spent sneaking about was quite pleasing due to these little things. However, these all disappeared as soon as I realised it was easier just to sprint everywhere.  As I touched on, it's the little things that make or break a game for me. Little things like 'nice I can open this door slowly and quietly, ok lets shut it [SLAM]... FFS'.  This game would have been amazing if the level design matched the impressive 'sneak play' and character-environment interactions.",

            "review_text": "One of the few hyped-up horror games of 2013 that deserved its hype in full. The nuanced movement, while seeming a bit like Mirror's Edge, at the same time feels smooth, almost second-nature after being given a lobby area to get it down (though it won't take long to adjust to Outlast's controls). The cam-corder mechanic creates the situation wherein not only is the flashlight trope avoided in a creative way, but the story and focus of the gameplay is built upon interestingly without feeling like either is made simply for the sake of the other. Normally, whilst Asylums can be bit of a trope of their own in horror games, and this game is really no exception, the handling of the environment working in tandem with the story blows previous torch-bearers of the Asylum trope (Nightmare House 2, Dementium) away. The game doesn't feel like its objectives are intrusive like many modern FPS games out today, you practically don't have to look at the objectives; your movement and exploration compliments the objectives anyway, as the objectives and tasks are simply to continue progressing, and they don't feel fetch-quest-like to the point of seeming like your path is only blocked occasionally so the game has an excuse to make you grab something. Many times your obstacle can be bypassed using an object you can find before you even noticed your path is blocked, so said blockages never feel contrived. The no-combat basis is a standard of the 2012-present survival horror game revolution but the camera system here lends credibility to the no-fighting-back inclusion here. The 'Hiding' mechanic is perfectly handled as well; the ability of enemies to see where you are - even if you're hiding - creates a kind of tension and fear that stacking crates behind a door in Amnesia just can't hold a candle to. The atmosphere is very SCP-Containment-Breach-like. Silence is your only friend in the shadowy corridors of Mt. Massive, with camera static taking up foreground mostly, and string-instruments stabbing you at key scare moments to enhance the effect. While the violin-stabs at jump-scares can be seen as a horror trope, the atmosphere playing upon monotony allows for the player's vivid imagination to take over, imagining what lurks behind the next corner, hoping for something to break the silence, even though the only thing that can break the silence is something you don't want. All in all, if you're willing to look past the tropes of the Asylums &amp; Nazi Doktors, Outlast's atmosphere, story, and gameplay will haunt you (in a good way).",

Ultimately, the most standout feature from Outlast is the use of a handheld camera, which runs out of batteries and can leave you completely in the dark at times.

You do not have a gun, all you have is a camera with night vision and no this is not like a fatal frame type game in which your camera is magical and can seal the souls of evil spirits. It is magical in the fact it can take any type of AA batteries and turn it into a power source.   Here is the game in a nutshell, you run around looking for a story then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and you want out. You use your night vision to try to find your way out and avoid losing a game of tag with the psychos in the asylum.   The atmosphere is great but there is no pay off. Your night vision will give you a headache and mid-way through lets just say something happens to your camera making it a nightmare to look through.   Maybe I’m a bit harsh, because in the end a small team made this game and it is playable. So if you have about 3 to 4 hours to kill and like horror games go ahead. I gave this game two “Meh.”.",

            "review_text": "PLAY IN THE DARK WITH HEADSET... AND BE SURE YOUR DOOR IS LOCKED SO YOU WON'T BE DISTURBED!  SUCH AN OUTSTANDING AND CREEPY GAME! Well done Red Barrels!  Without spoiling, I'll just give you a little taste of what this game is. Think of a mix between games like Mirror's Edge, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Condemned: Criminal Origins and with some vibe of SAW &amp; REC movies into the game.  Basically, you're a journalist, trying to make a huge scoop and you get tipped by an 'anonymous source' about illegal activities undergoing at Mount Massive, Colorado (which is a true place by the way), at an abandonned asylum.  And the fun begins once you get trapped inside... figure out the rest!   Armed with your camcorder, your legs &amp; arms and especially your wits, the only defense you've got is running and hiding. Welcome to Outlast!  PROS: +Lighting and shadows very well used and paced. +Scary, creepy ambience and amazing setting. +Beautiful, ominous environments. +Excellent soundtrack and effects. +Interesting story told through documents and notes. +Fast-draining night vision camera keeps tensions high. +Absence of weapons requires smart uses of running and hiding.   CONS: -The last hour of the game (running widly everywhere... takes a few tries before knowing exactly where to go!). -Too many batteries scattered around. Makes it easy using Night-Vision! -Camcorder night-vision mode doesn't drain fast enough, in my opinion! -Repetitious (Go to B, find X; Go to C, find Y; Get back to A). -Lack of enemy variety causes some predictability  -Game is relatively short (Between 4 to 6 hours and you should beat it by then... surely lesser if you speedrun). -Lack of option to turn down the music (annoyed me since it gets very very loud at times!).  OVERALL: For the first game made by Red Barrels, I raise my hat to them! Finally, the return of good SURVIVAL HORROR games, like they used to be scary! Resident Evil could learn many things there, same with countless other wannabe scary games! I do hope Red Barrels has many other titles in mind to scare the be-jesus out of me again!  FINAL THOUGHTS: Outlast is a weapons-free survival horror adventure that scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of you! It can stand proudly as a unique and terrifying survival horror game. Unlike many modern horror games, it remembers that the most frightening monsters are those that you can't kill, but have to flee from, and it creates an outstandingly creepy atmosphere that renders you defenseless against its many well-paced jump scares.   SCARE FACTOR: While it is very scary, I would say Amnesia: The Dark Descent was a scarier experience to me... maybe because A:TDD has more playtime? I would say though, it is more scary than Condemned!   RATING: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 9.5 / 10  PS:  If you intend to buy the PlayStation 4, Outlast will be free if you're a subscriber of PS+... however, the game won't release until 2014!",

Similar to the tiny spot of light you had to use to navigate in the original Silent Hill, your only source of light to help you in your survival is an inefficient nightvision on a digital camera. If the unknown disguised by the dark wasn't bad enough, the majority of threats you'll be running from are broken mental patients with unpredictable tendancies. You can never know for sure which of them will be passive, and which will attempt to brain you in accordance with the voices in their head. The environments vary nicely, from the asylum interior, to a venture outside to the gardens, and the few characters you meet seem like they'd have really interesting stories about themselves.  Outlast is a great horror game because nearly every single fiber of it is truly unpredictable. The characters, story, and events that unfold are never fully clear, even after you beat the game. Kudos to the developers for understanding the power of subtlety, and for understanding of the effectiveness of the unknown.",

Do play this game if you like the horror genre. Do play it if you like that feeling of being hopeless and scared.

P.S. my laptop isn't quite up to par with this game's requirements, so I seldom experienced better than 20 frames a second + some sounds were slightly skippy.

Having finally completed the Whistleblower DLC this Halloween, one thing comes to mind – dudes hang dong…again! Keep in mind these dudes also want to bash your brains in with lead pipes.   And there is also a guy randomly trying to play basketball with a severed head at one point too.  And if that wasn’t enough to give you nightmares, then a cannibal freak chasing you through darkened corridors as he sometimes yells out ‘Feed Me!!’ earlier in the game, and then later by a guy that fancies himself a groom, and you his bride, but only after he is successfully able to run you down through a series of decrepit rooms filled with moldering furniture and corroded sewing machines so that he can attempt to castrate you with a buzz saw and perform further ‘operations’ on you so as to turn you into a woman, certainly will (and not just if you’re a guy concerning that last part; I truly believe I’d feel the same fear/make believe pain in my ‘naughty parts’ even if I were a woman playing this game).   Definitely a scarier, wilder ride than the core game, and the unrelenting pursuit of the protagonist by the asylum’s denizens and the suffering they put him through truly makes you feel for him and his attempt to get the truth out about what is really going on at Mount Massive Asylum.",

It's not bad but if you're expecting some super good horror out of it - don't.  Sound and atmosphere are great, but the 'cam corder horror' trope from movies is taken too literally and poorly implemented. You see, the found footage plays on the idea, that someone found the footage and the unbelievable events happened for real. You are left scared at night thinking about the plausibility of the found footage. In outlast, you are recording these events. You know you're in a game recording face footage. It is just retundant.  Mechanics wise, the camera is useful since it has nightvision and events recorded on camera get notes. And only nightvision consumes batteries.  This means you should never, ever be without camera. For what reason having no camera is even in the game is beyond me. This is a broken, retundant mechanic.  The game is advertised as horror but yet it plays on the weakness of horror with too many jumpscares. Only times the game truly has been scary thus far has been when you're in a big room that has lots of potential hiding places. You are scared that someone might come and hunt you.  There should be more creative moments like that to get you scared, not an autist peeking at you through a hole you're crawling in. It's just wasted potential.  This should've really been a movie. You are always on rails, everything is extremely linear and there's nothing to explore or search for. Every playthrough will be identical sadly.  The strenghts of video games as a medium is choice and interactivity. This game has very little of either. You just walk and walk from one scare to next and from one glowy item to next.   In the end it's not an horrible game and not nearly as bad or offencive as far cry 3 or call of duties or battlefields or gone homes. It's just a alien isolation with less features but it is still worth the experience.  If you hope devs make a good game in the future, buy it and play it. If you want to experience it, just watch a let's play. Either way it'll be the same.",

Visuals, music, sound effects, voice acting - all of these are implemented amazingly. But I don't like to talk about positive aspects (especially because almost every review on steam extols this game to heaven), I would like to talk about drawbacks of this game.  First of all, story telling. I am not a fan of means to tell the story that this game uses. Namely, through documents/e-mails that you find during your adventure, although this method to tell the story is used in almost every horror game on the market. I don't like it because such documents are usually scattered in random order, and to understand what they mean you must find them all and read them after that in one particular order. Second thing, that I think should be improved is gameplay itself. In this regard Outlast is a generic horror game - corridor, hide, run. All enemy encounters are almost the same. There are two types of them - there you must hide, and there you must run. I presume developers might diversify these parts of the game somehow. So, let's conclude. This is a very, VERY good game, but still with some insignificant minuses, although nothing fatal. Highly recommended for all, who like GOOD HORROR games. P.S. I know that 'Red Barrels' are working on the second chapter. And if they manage to maintain all positive aspects of the game and get rid of negative ones, it will be almost perfect game. Time will tell.",

Outlast is pure survival horror, very effective in bringing on the scares and tension, but falls a bit short on gameplay. you will explore, hide, run away, cower and jump your way thru this terrible place and its freaky residents, to an unnerving soundtrack and sound FX, often accompanied by your character's own pounding heartbeat and frightened hyperventilation (physiological effects you may suffer yourself at times playing this game).   unfortunately, certain elements of the design and gameplay get in the way of immersion, continuity, and sense of accomplishment. your trusty vidcam's night vision will be indispensable to navigate the many dark places. great way to create hair-raising situations, but the cam sucks up batteries fast, an artificially limited resource unevenly distributed throughout the story. more than once I found myself annoyingly stumbling around large dark spaces, out of juice. the save/checkpoint system turned out to be whacked sometimes, saving my progress as if I had achieved a goal I had actually just failed, in effect giving me a free pass. too forgiving, for a game this brutal and full of despair. at the other extreme, surviving some encounters involved too much trial and error, instead of meaningful decision making (e.g. which paths or doors to take in chase scenes).    there are other weak bits, like enemies often searching under the bed or opening the locker next to the one where you're hiding. first couple of times you hold your breath in fear of discovery, after that it just feels contrived. there are also missed opportunities for more creative escape options besides the repetitive hiding and running. still, this game delivers where it matters most: on horror and adrenaline-inducing moments, just enough doses of terror to overlook its flaws.",

I believe one of the most significant aspects of a video game is its atmosphere - one of Outlast's greatest features, and one reason why it's so much more than just a scary game. It's terrifying, haunting, and affecting.   The game's weaker points are the repetitive tasks; enter a new area inhabited by a new enemy who walks a robotic path patrolling different rooms that you'll need to access to complete the current objective. Hide from the enemy and study his movements. Then sneak past him and advance forth to complete the objective. That's essentially what you'll be doing for most of the game.   The story is outstanding, however, so you'll likely be provoked to advance through the game even after becoming bored with the repetitive gameplay. I won't spoil the story, but I will highly recommend the DLC to experience a more complete ending. Let me clarify that I don't believe the original ending is flawed, but I do believe that the DLC ending paired with the original makes for a much better experience.   My favorite aspects of the game were the scenes I encountered. Again, I prefer not to spoil anything, but I will say that it displays some outstanding horror scenes. I'm not talking about standard gore such as blood, bodies, limbs - those things are present throughout. But there are a handful of memorable scenes that will certainly grab your attention. You'll see.  In short, the base game and DLC are worth the current price of about $30 combined, and the experience is worth your time.",

I've enjoyed all of them in their own way but Penumbra always stood out as being the only one that had a story I was actually interested in pushing through. I can include Outcast in that category as well now - not only was the gameplay solid and tense but the story kept you guessing and had an interesting progression and conclusion.  Compared to Amnesia and others in that category, Outlast is far more action packed - there is much more running from things that are right on your tail, barely diving into and locking doors behind you, and sneaking around enemies that are just a step away from detecting you. While the action elements were very tense, my biggest gripe with the game was with hiding - every single time you hide in a locker the enemy will come into the room, check a couple lockers, and leave. They will *never* check the locker you're in. This gets predictable and annoying after the second time and it's almost comical to watch it happen every single time. Honestly I would have preferred to have a chance that the enemy would open your locker so that hiding in a locker wouldn't result in just sitting through the little waltz of locker checking as you get up and get a drink.  The Whistleblower expansion is also worth the buy - it's much more fast-paced and action-packed than the original and has many more disturbing scenes mashed into the smaller package. Likewise it adds a great intertwining element to the story of Outlast and was fun to play after completing the original chapter.  Together the package is worth the buy for any fan of horror games, especially if you liked the Amnesia type games and would like to try a more action oriented approach to that style. Try it on Nightmare difficulty from the start for a 'meant to be played this way' experience - it's challenging without adding a cheap element like many games do, and the battery limitations of Nightmare make for some very tense moments that you would otherwise miss out on in lower difficulties.",

            "review_text": "Outlast is a strange case. Horror has been almost suffocated to death by an overreliance on jumpscares, cliche storylines, and unlikable characters. Outlast has all of those things in it, but somehow succesfully helps horror breathe again. The jumpscares are in an atmosphere so dense and unrelentingly dark, that none of the atrocities that make you jump out of your seat seem out of place or forced. The storyline that seems like it has been done before soon unfolds into a deep, atmospheric, and heartbreaking tale of artifical technology, nazi science experiments, corparate greed, and tragic tales of men made into monsters. But Outlast tells this story in a fashon that is only comparable to Half-Life and Dark Souls; it hides several notes, documents, and scenes of exposition that, if really analyzed, reveals a lore that is even more expansive and fascinating than FNAF or Half-Life. And every character has a history that makes them just as sympathetic as they are scary (and they are terrifying), with the exception of the protagonist, who is just some guy in the wrong place at the wrong time, although he becomes very interesting at the end of the game. The sound design is amazingly immersive, and for an independent game, the graphics are fantastic. The characters are well-rounded (if you are able to find any information on them), the enemies are scary, and the game is great in almost every oither aspect. Outlast isn't without it's faults though. The pacing of the game is very fast, it starts off strong, and keeps going without letting up as it never lets you rest. This is great for horror fans, but for anyone who is the least bit sensitive to stress and fear, it could be very upsetting (but this is of course a horror game, so if you get upset by this game then it's your own fault). Also, it contains about six or seven fetch quests that walk the line between tense and tedious. Luckily they stay on the tense side of that line for the most part, but occasionally dip their toe into the tedious area, and even though this will only last a few minutes, it is very frustrating. The DLC is also something you need to play if you want to fully understand the game, and while Outlast: Whistleblower is arguably better than it's main game, it's still extra money. Lastly Outlast has a tendency to reuse some enemy models, which is perfectly understandable because this is an independent game, but it can break the immersion for some. All in all though, I give outlast a strong 8 out of 10, and if the sequel expands on this story at all, that rating might go up. Outlast has the potential to be the next Silent Hill, and I do want that for this game, because it really deserves it. If you like horror, and are bored of games like Daylight, Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, any Silent Hill game after the second one and the other lackluster horror games that are strangling the genre, you'll probably love Outlast, but if you don't like horror, then you should stay very far away from this game.",

Don't believe the people who say it's not scary. I doubt they're playing with headphones alone at night and in the dark.  This game is thrilling!",

The storyline is gripping and always has you on your toes, and the realisticly terrifying graphics are quite outstanding. This horror game incorporates many different elements into its plot as well. Chases, Hiding, Searching, gore, and most importantly- horror. Outlast is definately worth the price, especially if horror games interest you. I love this game and I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a long, scary, and exciting expirience!",

            "review_text": "Outlast is a horror game that is genuinely scary. This game is really ♥♥♥♥ed up. When this game is at its best, it IS the best horror game ever made. Unfortunately, there are some serious issues that highly irritated me and too frequently killed the tension and made the game a chore. The story is about a reporter investigating some strange goings-on at mental asylum. Rumor has it that there's a old Nazi doctor that has been performing mind control experiments related to the CIA's MKULTRA program. A lot of horror games these days seem like they are positively soaked in mind control imagery and themes, but ironically Outlast is one of the few horror games that explicitly mentions the program by name and it seems absent the standard disassociative dreamworld themes that are so prevalent in the modern horror game genre. Anyway, very soon after arriving the power goes out and the protagonist is attacked. The goal then changes from getting the story to just escaping. There's a running gag in the game where the main character is juuuuussst about to make it out of the front door when something happens to stop his escape. Loved that. What they did right was having most of the game be really dark. The reporter brought his video camera with night vision on it and frequently the game needs to be played through the night vision on the view finder of the video camera. The catch is that the night vision drains batteries and more batteries need to be found in order to actually see your surroundings. It was panic inducing trying to figure out where to go having to constantly make split second decisions because some Frankenstein monster was running after me just a half step behind. There are tons of scripted events in the game. Tons of jump scares. Many of the jump scares are effective, some just felt like I was in the modern version of a Haunted House ride at the fair. There are lots of NPC inmates around that give the game environment a living feel. Outlast is at its best when you're traversing through the asylum going from point A to point B running from lunatics and chaos is happening all around you. The parts that really got annoying were the way too frequent tasks of having to flip x number of switches or collect y number of macguffins. The patrolling enemy AI would have this sixth sense for where I was at all times. You can hide in lockers or under beds to evade death (the player has no weapons) but then the problem is not being able to see anything and never knowing when its safe to leave. I understand why these parts are in the game, but they need to be DRASTICALLY reworked for future sequels. These parts almost ruined the entire experience for me In fact, I'd say just skip the Whistleblower DLC, it's jammed pack full of overly frustrating experiences and doesn't really offer anything new except for plot points. The main game took around 7 hours to finish. This game is not for the squeamish. There is a lot of brutal graphic violence. I tell you this as a hard core horror junkie. You may want to consider if Outlast is too extreme for you. Outlast is the cutting edge of scary and gory video games right now. There is lots of both in Outlast. There are some significant problems I had with this game, but at the end of the day it was an amazing thrill ride that horror fans should play.",

You're playing with Miles Upshur in the main game , who is a riporter , who wants to investigate the 'secrets' of Mount Massive Asylum. At the beggining it starts like every horror. lets go explore stuff , and things like that! But when you reach the Library....'♥♥♥♥ just gonna go real' :D. This game is scary as ♥♥♥♥. Well depends by the player , i didnt got scared nor jumpscared mutch , but the Atmosphere was with me the whole time. As the game says , you're not a fighter , you need to hide , run or die. The Enemies of the main game is just freaking awesome. Walker , Trager , The Twins , The Walrider..! These are really good enemies of the game! You always need to be careful because these guys are business. expectially Walker and Trager! The Story is really great , awesome and also suprising! I personally find this horror game the best of all ( with Amnesia the Dark Descent ) , because of its great Atmosphere and its story! Damm , we didnt even talk about the WhistleBlower DLC , wich is really awesome!. Well , lets see the pros and negative things.  Pros :  - Awesome Story - Awesome Atmosphere - Really great Camera system , makes the game intense as ♥♥♥♥ :D - Scary game - REALLY SCARY GAME - Good Ending IF you understood the ending ( after you finished the game , go to Outlast wiki and read about it! suprising as hell ) - Really awesome Enemies! - Trager - And also a freaking good DLC to the game! MUST GET DLC.  Negatives : - ( dont take this one seriously ) On Insane difficulty , the game is a nightmare. dont even try it. trust me. - Low ammount of bugs , but these bugs can easilly can kill your Insane difficulty walktrough - ( nor this one xD ) In the DLC , the Cannibal enemy is freaking scary. pls no more cannibals Red Barrels :'(  So yea , Outlast is a freaking great game! for me it was a 9.5/10! ( Yea , and also , if there is a sale for this game , its not 20 or 15 euro , only 5 ! at sales , must buy ;D )",

Cons? -Storyline is a bit short (only took me 5 hours, including deaths) -Not that big of a con but it's ♥♥♥♥ dark at times, even when you have your camera out, you'll get used to it though. -The big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll find out who that is soon enough. -The ending was a little dissapointing to me, it didn't sour the overall experience though. -The 'do A to access B' scenarios can feel a little samey, however the different locations overpower this for the most part  Pros? I won't list things, this game is excellent at keeping you on your toes and I found it immersive and fun, I haven't enjoyed playing a spooky games as much as I have this one in a lot of years. Despite the minor issues I listed above it still manages to be an engrossing and fun game and I strongly recommend it.  Not a pro or a con really but if you find yourself too spookied at the start, give it time, you should become a little more used to the atmosphere etc. as you play the game more.

The graphics (while not terribly fancy) certainly do the trick, and the music and sound effects are always superb. Everything about the game (peering around corners, laboured breathing when scared, etc) is designed to immerse you in the experiences of the character. If you like horror games, then you MUST have this in your Steam library.  There are some downsides to make note of; the climax of the main game (not the DLC) suffers from WTF syndrome and also simply goes on too long, plus thematically and atmospherically the game does begin to repeat itself (not too much, mind you). As well, if you don't like jump-scares you should note that there are more than a few, although in my opinion they were rather well done, and certainly not cheap at all.

The team did an outstanding job of mimicing the sound, look, and feel of a night-vision handicam. This is one of the main hooks of the gameplay, and serves as an interesting mechanic.  The various antagonists you meet in the game are quite interesting, with the most fascinating getting the least screen-time and the least exploration. Trager is one such character that certainly could have used some more material.  The sound design is solid, though the musical chords oftentimes run over what you're trying to hear. The music is the typical 'rising violin' chords, sometimes supplemented with eery vocalization. This is used far too often, and becomes an annoyance before long.  The game is fun and tense, but begins to outstay its welcome far before the end. The game feels flat and ultimately, other than the scripted jump-scares, was not terribly scary in the slightest. Much of the lack of fear came from how unabashedly safe and formulaic this game is. The musical cues ruin any pretense of suspense, and the AI's predicatability is laughable. There are so many short-sighted design decisions that were made to up the 'OMG SO SCARY BRO' momentary reactions, that the long-term creepy/immersive aspects of the game suffered.   This game is the pinnacle of Michael Bay-style horror. Quick moving, exciting, tense, but ultimately flat and shallow. Once it is over, it is over. Nothing sticks with you past the second you click close.  Good, but safe/shallow. Booga-booga scares get old far before the game ends. Could have used more atmospheric and story-based horror elements to increase immersion and player investment in the story/outcome.",

What gets really annoying is that you're in a mental hospital full of surgical instruments and shattered wood and visbile rebars and broken glass and not once (at least as far as I got, I didn't finish.) are you ever given the option to defend yourself when pretty much every single person you come across is trying to kill you at one point or another. You just spend your time getting hurt, playing a lowly, emasculated male of the worst kind; a coward.  Games can be scary and allow you to fightback, just like the early Resident Evil games, Aliens Vs Predator (1999) and the masterpiece that is Condemned.  We could have had a new Condemned with this game in the most perfect setting, instead we got some Amnesia wannabe.   A real shame.  Also, what happened to all those guns the spec ops team brought in? Why wasn't the journalist carrying a gun to defend himself? Too many questions justified by the mechanics the game's designers (who worked on the first 'bad' Splinter Cell) wanted to force on us.",

The music compliments the experience flawlessly...leaving you with the lights on for the rest of the night. The use of the nightvision with your camera is brilliant and though you'd think it would become tiresome it becomes a survival tool that even changes itself along with the journalist you control.  The level of detail OVERALL is staggering. This is an extremely well made game - especially if you treat it as an experience.  If you can handle playing this in the dark...with earphones...by yourself...then do it. If you're like me, don't you friggin dare!",

Outlast makes you want to force yourself to remember hiding spots for unwanted incounters with the occupants of this asylum. The voice acting is also well done and belivable. It is fairly short, but I still enjoyed this game immensely, more because Outlast's atmosphere gives you the creeps. I did not find this game to be overly scary, especially once you reach the half point of the game, I ended up expecting certain things to pop up from different areas of the building taking away from the 'horror' of it. I still highly recommend Outlast to horror survival fans because Red Barrels created a wonderfull game, it is beatiful with attention to detail, and well worth the price of $20.",

Yeah the game is a good length with little repeition outside a few things, but overall experience is beyond commenting on, besides to say it is the best horror game of the year easily.   Why, well, it does have shock value, and jump frights, and still manages to set the mood correctly. Even though it is a guided tour, they still allow us hardcore gamers to get rewarded for searching nooks and crannies with extended content in the form of notes, and reward you with more in your supply of batteries. The best feature is, it doesn't feel guided, or that your on rails. It walks the line between guess work and obvious routes, they achieve this by making a plain 'plan', like 'get to 3rd floor' or 'find the key', which allows you to discover areas and search at your own disgression. The only problem is, your in a facility crawling with lunitacs, and the problem with that is, most are set free to do whatever they want.   Although they lacked many key antagonist in the game, there are 4 special guys who you don't forget which is actually quite a lot for an indie game, the important is covered cause they leave an impression..........and you leave an impression on them. I have to admit, the first 20-30 minutes of the game, are some of the scariest moments in gaming. In real life, no one in their right mind would ever enter......but you have to, if you find a way!!!   Bottomline, it is a must play game for any Indie or Horror fan, with plenty of action, horror, night vision, running, and most importantly, HIDING! I think every gamer should at least play through the first part, it is as amazing.    ",

Over all it is very short, and despite never finding all the collectables I had no desire to play this again, so 4-5 hours is about as much as I expect you could get out of this game. Graphics wise it is nice, but felt a little uninspired.

I may be expecting something more than what was delivered, don't put hatred into my review as people have different points of view.

Nice thing is you do not have to read any of the docs or pay attention to the story to enjoy the game, you just know you have to avoid bad guys seeing you, hide, run, figure out how to get to the next area and ect.. Very simple game in the sense you don't really have to have quick reflexes or able to press a bunch of buttons to play it.  The Simplicity could be a good or bad thing depending of what you want from a game. It is simple in the sense that you can't craft, you can't move things from one area to get to another area, a lot of the interaction your character does is automatic with just walking up to things except for climbing to higher ground and open/ close doors.  I give this game a 7/10 because there is no real replay value in it. Once you complete the game and go to replay it again, you know what to expect and how to go about it (which is realy simple). When that happens, what took you 30 minutes before will now take you 2 minutes, litterly. Last night I went to replay this game on insane (same difficulty as the previouse except when you die, you start all the way back at the beginning of the game) and got half way through the game in 1 hour. I died because of my own dumb error. But on the good note, I usually give a game with no replay value and none moddable no higher than a 5/10, so this game is fun.",

I loved my experience with this game and i will definitely play through it multiple times. Getting a little braver knowing now what is around the corner. It would have been pretty great however, to be able to watch everything you ended up recording in your camera after you complete the game, but beggers cant be choosers.  One of my favourite games this year and is currently the best horror game i have ever experienced.  ------DLC UPDATE------ The dlc is a satisfying extension to the original game. a fair few scary new faces as well as your favorite old buddies are back to amp your stress to the extreme. well deserved its given price, it's a suprisingly lengthy update which brought even more scares and wonderfully disturbing scenes.  A must if you enjoyed the original game.",

The game is visually stunning on both a macro (level design, effects) and micro (texture work) level. Special mention should be made of the audio, which is excellent and really ads to the suspense.

By non believers I mean those who don't think video games can be horrifiying. Story is drastically simple, there is a an insane asylum in San Antonio that has completely gone off the grid........ Dark, nobody can get a call through or anything. The main character is an investgative reporter who was just going to knock on the door and ask a couple of questions. That didnt work out to well. The controls are amazing, the ability to climb up ledges is a brilliant touch on the FPS side of things. Along with the ability to turn your head around while you sprint to see if whats chasing you is close or not? Scary and practical to say the least. The visuals are down right haunting, The asylum feels like it was just in working order even though it hasnt been for some time. the obvious feeling that there was a struggle in the facility is very present. The stacking of bed frames and chairs against doors and the destroyed walls show that there has been some kind of a struggle. Attention to detail is shocking, you could literally smell the place sometimes. I have a big complaint amongst all of the praise I have been throwing its way. Wow is it short. I beat this gripping game in roughly 9 hours. If it were 20 or even 40 hours though it might have been too much. So maybe I'm wrong in that department maybe the game was just right. Overall I loved this game, Streaming it so my friends could watch made it all the better as I had an entire room of people screaming and jumping out of their seats.

Once you look behing the mechanic of the game and see that the KI for example is really stupid and the  mission goals are not really challenging,the game lost all its charme and it just made me rush the inmates instead of dodging/hiding since it comes out to the same result all in all but its way faster.

The story is amazing and with the style of actual game-play provides truly scary and adrenaline ride. Go for it, if you like to be scared when using bathroom at midnight.  +review for DLC Whistleblower:  Rating: 9/10  Overall you can consider this DLC as an addition to original story, with the same style of game-play. In comparison to main title, Whistleblower contains much more gore and repulsive content, which someone may like, someone not, but the atmosphere is still tense as hell.

The game puts you into the feet of the reporter Miles Upshor a man who seeks to expose the asylum for misconduct and maltreatment and finds its much worse then he could have dreamed. As you play the search for notes the urge to film some gruesome scene and constant fear really puts you into his skin to the point where a player may just think that he is miles.

I hope you like my review and enjoy this game if you get it! This game I would happily award a 9/10 for these reasons: Freaky as hell +2 Overly gruesome +2 Boat loads of blood, guts +2 Jump scares +1 Graphics and game performance +1 Twisted, sickness and how messed up the game is +1 This is EASILY the scariest game I have ever played for a while. I wouldnt recommend this for smaller children unless they want to see the following: Occasional One-eyed snakes, Booty and blood smeared all over the place with guts behind it, and over all the intensity of the game. Whenever someone or something starts chasing me my heart rate picks up and I get adrenaline and scream like a small child. Well I am 12 so I guess that I am a small child but I would totally recommend this game to a person who likes scary movies and games AND gore. Thanks for reading my review and I hope that if you are comfortable with all the above so you dont get a surprise when you purchase it and only end up playing it for a few minutes and then uninstalling it after the first jumpscare, setting your computer on fire and running it over with a car.",

It relies on extremely, EXTREMELY over-the-top gore, borderline goofy jumpscares, and outright cartoonishly evil villains. It is, however, for this very reason, incredibly fun! It's like a big, high budget haunted house ride, with guys in masks popping out at you at every turn to go boo, only in this ride, they're actually allowed to touch you, and/or kill you and do the nasty with your dead body. By far the biggest draw for me is the residents of the asylum itself; they range from pitiful, tortured patients who have no interest in harming you to, in a sequence I'd rather not spoil, a wise-cracking sadist who puts Freddy Krueger to shame in terms of loving what he does.

Set in a giant psychiatric hospital full of deformed, horrifying maniacs, you play as Miles Upshur (funny name) as he tries to escape the asylum because he was dumb enough to go there just so he could get footage of the inhumane experiments that occur there. The main theme of this game is run, hide, or die, which is a common theme in horror games except this game does it very well. The soundtrack is exceptionally pleasing, and the atmosphere is fantastic. In my opinion, the story could have been better, but I think it's good the way it is. The DLC was definitely a great addition to the game and story. Also, the inclusion of different types of maniac inmates who are chasing you was great, and added a bit of uniqueness to each enemy. I'm mostly referring to the main bad guys such as Trager, the Twins, and Chris (little pig guy), but I also mean the normal inmates, as they all tend to have different varied dialogues and personalities from each other that really adds to the creepy insanity that has taken over the asylum. One inmate wants to burn the asylum down, one just wants to stand in the corner, one might want to club your head in just because. The only thing I didn't like was the main character himself, Miles Upshur. He is of course scared and concerned about his situation, but also seems unrealistically jokey in his journal. Umm, no. The new character in Whistleblower is a much better protagonist, and I also liked the new variants from Whistleblower, which is why I liked Whistleblower more than the original game. Finally, one last thing I want to talk about, and it's the most important part... Is it scary? Yes, yes it is. The creepy dark setting combined with being constantly hunted by monstrous deformed men is absolutely horrific. Don't even get me started on the jumpscares. You're already on edge, since Chris (little pig guy) tends to appear out of nowhere, the last thing you need is a guy popping up in your face out of nowhere. All in all, this game is great in all aspects except Miles Upshur sucks, but I still give it 10/10 since the only dialogue he has is his grunts or screams of pain.

My Thoughts:- A very good game if you like your scares and jump moments, and the often “Oh god Oh god where do I go” moments of panic I like It a lot good to give you something late at night.  Achievements:- 9 of 14 (43%) Achievements Earned  Graphics:- graphics are good but i spent all gam elooking tro the camcorder there are some tweaks you can do and there are a few strange textures now and again.  Story:- You’re a reporter investigating a nut house. Owned by the Murkoff Corp about some strange events. As you enter the building you quickly find out that you’ve just walked into hell.  Replayability:- Quite a bit if you like your jump scares and moments of pure panic.  What Could Be Added: higher textures.  Rating:- 9 / 10",

I guess I was expecting more from the overwhelming positive reviews and that elevated the game just enough for it to be a massive let down.  So you're a reporter with no weapons, pushing the helpless horror over action/horror mentality. Only a few minutes in you're introduced to the camcorder/nightvision in what I saw as some throwback Fatal Frame love. Toss in the limitation of battery life on the nightvision and I was sold, these are the makings of horror gold.  From that point it was the ham-handedness and 'on the nose' x 1,000,000 execution that killed it for me. The lighting ranges from vaccuum of space absolute blackness to single birthday candle bright. We get it, use the nightvision. From the midpoint on the enemies become predictable and would-be scares turn to 'Roll a d6 to see if he checks the locker you're hiding in or the one beside it, aaaaaand... ♥♥♥♥.' Don't worry though, tipped over book cases or slightly askew filing cabinets will be your saviors and nothing says safety like a staircase of vending machines to open vents.  I won't comment much on the hackey writing as I don't want to spoil anything. If you're familiar with 'DOOM: Repercussions of Evil' you pretty much know where this train is headed.  If you're thinking about picking up Outlast, take a look at Alien: Isolation. This is obviously all opinion but Alien: Isolation does (almost(endings are hard)) everything better.

Voice-acting couldn't be better, and the music can add to the spooky tone. The sound of footsteps just behind you, and the whir of a crazy cannibal's power saw just behind the back of your head make you feel terrified.

The DLC, Whistleblower, adds more to the main story, answering many questions you may have had. 8.5/10  AI:The AI is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing smart. That's not something to be happy about, because you sure as hell don't have any buddies in this game. Enemies can hear you like they see you-better if you're a dumbass.

The gameplay is very simple, and the storyline isn't bad neither that good. I sincerely thought that i would finish the game in many hours, but i just finished it in less than 5 hours (maybe it's because i played on the easiest difficulty, but i don't feel to play it again...) However, this game is overall nice, i took it for 3,99 Eur and i wouldn't spend more than 5 Eur for this title. Ps: the game ending is very bad ._. At least for me...  [ITA]Outlast non è veramente così horror, ci sono giusto un pò di scene scriptate (e quelle se non le conosci ti fanno veramente saltare in aria, lol). La grafica è fantastica, e mentre si usano gli infrarossi sembra reale, è un effetto pazzesco (e ci ho giocato con i settaggi al minimo!) Il gameplay è molto semplice, la storia non è un granchè ma nemmeno tanto male. Sinceramente pensavo di metterci molto di più a finirlo, l'ho finito in meno di 5 ore (anche se ci ho giocato a difficoltà facile, ma non ho voglia di rigiocarlo...) In conclusione, questo gioco alla fine è carino, l'ho preso per 3,99 Euro e sinceramente non ci spenderei più di 5 euro per questo titolo. Ps: il finale del gioco è proprio brutto!

The game also features an amazing night vision camera that adds to the games creepy gritty atmosphere. The game features basic Amnesia style run and hide gameplay with platforming. The game’s night vision camera effects the gameplay by requiring the player to collect batteries to use the camera to be able to see in the dark. The game also features well crafted jumpscares that geniously got me at times. The only thing I found disappointing was the game’s ending but hey nothing's perfect.The game was thrilling and enthralling experience that I will never forget. Outlast is a modern horror masterpiece. Overall Outlast gets a 10/10. I can’t wait for the sequel coming out late 2016.

I really like how the story goes. I love how all of it takes place in a asylum. Its unique how they added The Walrider. I like how the game makes you think a little bit on where to go and what you're supposed to do they really put in effort into this game. I'm almost certain the second is gonna be as good or even better. So overall this game is a great game, I definitely recommend this game its mainly a horror game but has like a maze like scene to it which makes it awesome.",

The mechanics of the camera was interesting, as was the typical 'silent protagonist' expressing himself through notes.  The Whistleblower DLC is well worth the price and manages to show off more elements to the story than I had expected initially.  A few jumpscares, but otherwise not particularly scary despite not pulling the punches when it comes to gore. Honestly it was more disturbing/sad than anything.",

The major flaw I found was that the jumpscares were very predictable and I found myself left more bored than scared, though this was not a major problem for me, but it could be for some people and it really didn't matter because the edge I got when I was hiddening and sneaking around really made up for it, but thats entirely based on the person and some might find it doesn't make the game any better. Over all Outlast is a good horror game, but its at no level at the level of my favorite horror game, that being Amensia: The Dark Descent which really made me feel scared.",
