The first time, I have to admit that I got scared, but then everything was getting predictable because it was just another copy of the game like Slender / SCP. In itself, the game is worthy of attention primarily because it is very short, the average playing time is about 30 minutes. Unfortunately, it has many shortcomings, I happened to go (accidentally) through the wall or at some point fired into the air, also you can see from afar like a lighthouse glowing eyes of the enemies, which in my case reduces the fun of scare up. However, this game is free. Do you have a lot free time? Download and try this out.",

            "review_text": "All Is Dust is worth playing mostly because it's so short. If you're looking for quick, chea,p scares this game has them, although like many games in the genre this game has its flaws.  I was quite suprised by the graphics of this game. The visuals are quite nice to look at, and I believe it's because this game sticks to a consistent art style, with none of the assets feeling out of place. The lighting effects also are quite good for a game like this, and go a long way in improving the visuals. Don't get me wrong, the graphics in this game aren't triple A quality, and have some problems. For instance, the corn crops suffer from terrible pop-in often appearing right in front of me as I wandered throughout the farm. However, the graphics in this game are better than many other indie horror games i've seen. The gameplay is a mixed bag with this game. Like most other horror games, this game does a good job at building the atmosphere in the beginning. I was actually starting to see stuff out of the corner of my eye as i dreaded when the monster would appear. However, once the monster does appear things start to go downhill. The monster is a mix of slenderman and SCP-173. It stalks you just as the slenderman did in slender, and like SCP-173 it will attack you if you cease looking at it. Therefore as you wander the farm, you must listen to the monsters footsteps and put it in your field of view to prevent it from attacking you. This does work for a short time, and the monster encounters were tense for awhile. But unfortunately the gameplay then begins to decline. As the game progresses the monster just becomes annoying as you must walk backwards, unable to see where you're going, just to avoid being hit. Eventually more of these monsters will appear, and while i assume this was to make things scarier, it's actually just annoying. You'll be hit from all directions until you just start spinning the camera around frantically yelling at the monsters to leave you alone. The story at first doesn't seem worth mentioning. It's your typical demonic cult type thing, and seems pretty throw away. The only reason i mention the story at all is because If you pay attention you may end up with your own interpretation of it like I did, especially if you know something about the time period.  There are some other flaws i should mention. First off the camera is terrible (at least on controller) and initally would spin around like my character was some guy hopped up on cocaine or something (given the events that you witness, this isn't too unlikely). Also sometimes i would receive button prompts for keyboard even though I was playing on the controller. Also, this game suffers from the 'Why am i doing this' problem that plenty of these slender type games do. Why am i collecting these fragments again? Why did i throw a key into the bottom of a well? BECAUSE ♥♥♥♥ING DEMONS, THAT'S WHY!  Luckily this game is short enough that it doesn't out stay it's welcome. If it were longer, it's flaws would probably ruin the experience. I do want to see more from this developer, and hopefully this will be a learning experience for them.",

This looks like a small time dev and a first production. Overall it has all the peices to be a great game. With some work on the models and textures, some added story, and a little touch-up on the voice over it has a lot of potential.  6/10  ",

For some reason after I select keyboard controllers I cant do anything. Not even Esc to a menu and exit. I have to Alt F4 out.  3.Noticed a few glitchy graphics.  In all I do like the concept but at this point it is far to buggy. I will keep an eye out for future updates and give it another try.",

This game starts strong, and the realism put into the background setting really kept me interested the whole way through, even if the storyline ended up being hazy and felt unfinished. Great design on the scarecrows, especially the glints on the eyes here and there, was also digging the long, spindly shadows inside the cabin. Nightmares for days, ya'll. Overall, a good, quick playing story-game that's worth a playthrough for the great sense of atmosphere, even if the plot itself is lacking.",

I left the doors open in the house so the were banging throughout which actually added to the game so I recommend having someone make unnecessary noise around you while you play! I also enjoyed the special floating blood that was smeared across the open space of an empty doorway.  This is the first game of this type that I have played but it had a clear element of slenderman. It had me on edge the whole time, my nerves were a wreck because you constantly feel paranoid that you are being followed and don't know when to run! It's a nice short game with the beginning of a story and then bits of story and I enjoyed the style of the cut scenes. It partially wrapped it up at the end but it never reeeeally explains what the outcome is. I would exlain from my point of view more but I don't want to spoil the game although it is then obvious where the little girl is which gave me a nice moment where I felt like I had accomplished something even though it is probably obvious to others prety quickly!  It's a creepy game that still has my heart racing now with an interesting story but that's about it. As it is free I would recommend it however it did crash three times which is why it took me over an hour to complete which was frustrating. It's a thumbs up from me... just.",

            "review_text": "Upon beating this game, I was at 21 minutes. When I started the game, I was already at 2 minutes, due to having to try a couple of different things to get it to run. So, it took 19 minutes to play through the entire game. My second run through the game took 10 minutes (I wanted to monitor RAM usage during a playthrough). That's not necessarily a bad thing. The game is free, and sometimes I want something I can play quickly with little to no real investment.   The controls were fine, even using a controller. At first, it seemed as though the in-game messages were locked to keyboard controls (it was telling me to press 'F' to pick things up). But, this fixed itself a bit later in the game, and switched the messages to the controller layout.  As I stated above, I played the game a second time in order to monitor my memory usage. I'm running a GTX 970, and I watched both the memory usage of the video card and the usage on my PC's memory. At the most I saw a jump to around 1500 MB on the video card, and a 500 MB jump on the PC's RAM. The reason I bring this up is the incredibly high stated requirements on the store page. With a minimum requirement of 8 GB and a recommended requirement of 16 GB, this could turn people away from trying the game when they may very well be able to run it with little issue.  Technical discussions aside, this is supposed to be a horror game, and I feel that is where it falters. There is no sense of dread. Sure, there are monsters, and they do become more prominent after each cut scene, but they're not scary. They only give chase when your back is turned to them, and disappear in a puff of dust when you near them with your lantern. This makes them incredibly simple to manage as you make your way around the farmhouse, and quickly gives the player a sense of invincibility that destroys any semblance of terror that could have been built.  So, is this game worthwhile? Sadly, no. Free does not mean that a game is exempt from critique. And this game fails at being what it sets out to be, which is a horror game. It brings nothing new to the table, and doesn't even get the fundamentals right. Horror, no matter what, should make one feel helpless in some way. This is why the newer Resident Evil titles are looked down on. They removed the sense of helplessness that the original titles had. There is nothing scary in a game where your lantern is essentially a weapon with unlimited ammunition, and simply looking at the big bad is enough to freeze it permanently.  It's just not horror when the monsters are more afraid of you then you are of them.",

To its credit the concept is awesome and unique (as far as survival horror games go, I'm pretty sure we've seen something similar spit out by Hollywood at some point, doesn't it look like a cross between Resident Evil, Paranormal Activity and Of Mice and Men?) and I was really hoping for an eerie experience set in the 1930'S American South.  Unfortunately the exciting concept is shattered by the same monotenous gameplay elements and and the exact feel seen in just about every indie survival horror since Slender. Go here. Go there. Collect this. You dont even have the challenge of having to find everything yourself (Which could add potential hours of gameplay to build atmosphere), you have a map that conveniently points out all of the cult's activity sites on your farm. It's almost like they GAVE you that map and wanted to be stopped.   The story is disturbingly linear and the antagonist is so easily thwarted that it plunges into the realm of a simple annoyance with a scary face. I mean you could walk right up to it and it seems to become more paralyzed with fear than you. The fact that it simply stands there and doesn't do anything completely shatters the atmosphere and and has you wondering how this game earned the title 'survival horror'. Youre never in any real danger and the monster can be shooed away like a bothersome fly.   So far as sound design goes the game is also severely lacking. No BAFTA for you. I imagine the developers were going for a realistic feel with the disturbing amount of silence, which is admirable, brave, but unfortunaly a bad move. Sound is 50% of the game experience, you might as well make it good. The game lacks the short little instrumental riffs to immerse you in the time and setting, and there's also no ambience. If anything, at least add ambience. creepy, unnatural sounds, disturbing, bassy drones, the spectral, eerie whispers that enriched the atmosphere of Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem. The short truth is that although silence may be realistic, as far as any media experience goes its just empty and makes you feel like an awkward scene from a cheesy soapie is unfolding before you.  I had really high hopes for this game, I was really excited and I'm still a fan of the concept explored. Creepy cult activity, an eerie monster that lurks in the corn (or should, because that would make it alot creepier), blood coated walls and fields of burning Crosses, its all very unsettling. But as original as it seems, its suprisingly not original. Just looking at the screenshots and gameplay vids one can see the arm and lantern schtick was ripped directly from more successful, big budget titles like the Amnesia series. It feels like youre playing Slender: Dustbowl Edition, minus all the scary ambience that made it what it was. The game lures you in with well scripted, dynamic menus, only to disappoint you with gameplay that doesnt live up to it.",

Over all, I'd give it about a 4/10. If you're into Slenderman/SCP games, give it a try. It is free after all.",

It asked me if I wanted to use a game pad, or keyboard. So assuming it supported the game pad, I chose that. When I push the stock forwards, my guy walks at an angle to the right. There is no way to change control settings or adjust the sensitivity, and it takes about 20-30 seconds for the guy to turn 360 degrees. So when you are walking down the path, and there is a turn,.. You stop whatever it is you are doing, Roll a joint. Grab a beer. Get a bag of Dorritos. And prepare for the long hual. Crack your knuckles. Adjust your nut sack.

Cons:  No pause menu (which I suppose is a really stupid stylistic choice), no graphics options, no mouse sensitivity slider, default mouse sensitivity sucks ♥♥♥.   Amazingly vague objectives.

And scarecrow guys molest you from the back. And sides.   The game is not really scary, I give you that. It's just the scarecrow touching you again and again. And for those who don't like being touched, it might be a trauma for them.
