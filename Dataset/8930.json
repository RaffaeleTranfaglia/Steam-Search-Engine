Everything goes normal, I meet caesar, the queen and the siamese ♥♥♥♥, you'll see later why I call him a ♥♥♥♥. He offers me to become allies, I, the friendly chancellor that I am accept, not knowing what the siamese had in store for me. Few decades later the siamese start a war against caesar, he expects me to join in and help against caesar, since I had problems with caesar before(That ♥♥♥♥ was ♥♥♥♥♥ing about my cities being too close to his borders...I saved so many settlers of his godd*amnit, be thankful!) I joined in. I steamroll caesar and capture every city. After that everything continues going fine,...until the japanese declared war on me and the siamese. Steamrolled the japanese. Following countries to perish is england. After this, world peace was achieved, or so I thought. How wrong I was. Around 1930 the siamese declare war on me, my allies that I deeply trusted used me to wipe the earth clean to get rid of enemies. He uses his nuke I gifted him on my nearest city, (rip Hamburg), so i start a fully blown blitzkrieg and get rid of him. Might've nuked some of his cities. After the war was over I looked at the ruins of what once was europe, asia and africa. Suddenly, another civilization pops up. Montezuma. He was stuck in the medieval age on the american continent. I am now taking care of him and his people so they can become a great civilization. I'll still be the greatest tho, science win wohoo!   Great game to create stories, 10/10. Best played with friends.",

            "review_text": "Fireaxis has managed to pull off a fantastic game here - Civilization V has a very in-depth play system that is easy to understand for beginners, and yet complex enough to keep even the most advanced user thinking. The turn-based system is quite fair, though a little bit does rely on luck if you're playing multiplayer (Who gets to host is 1st player, and thus gets 'Priority' on wonders, so if both you and player 1 have 1 turn left on The Great Library, Player 1 will get it first), but I personally play a lot of singleplayer. The bot difficulty level increases at a high rate as you go up - 1 is basically playing against yourself, 2 may be challenging for someone learning the game, 3 is an ok difficulty, though still a bit easy, 4 is the equivalent of a moderately skilled human player, and 5 has the tactic of a skilled player, plus extra science/food/production, so I personally play on level 4. I won't go into details about levels 6-8, because I've never tried them, nor do I plan to in the near future. The UI is quite user-friendly - If there is an action that needs to be done, it will show up in the lower-right corner just above the minimap. There are 4 'advisors' that help new players understand what to build, and how it will benefit them, as well as whether or not to attack an enemy unit, and even who you may stand a chance against in a total war! Spies also add a new level of strategy to the game, as you must decide whether you will try to steal technology from other people, or if you will protect your own technology. Then you add spy promotions, in which Recruits will almost always be beaten by Agents, who will almost always be beaten by Special Agents. By changing spies around that have different promotions, you can achieve a different level of defense and offense in espionage. For example, if you want to steal from a country that has lots of tech, but you just want intrigue about another nation that has little tech, you can send your Special Agent over to the country that has lots of tech, and your Recruit to the other nation.  Overall, this is a really fun game, the only drawback is it's price, but if it ever goes on sale, it is definitely worth picking up if you're into strategy games.",

Germany looks to Rome and asks them to push their Giant Death Robots towards my capital, dubbed 'Temple Prime (obvious reference)'. The robots march their way into a mountainous area where a wall of mountain protects several missile launcher platforms (MRLS basically) who launch a barrage at them. Rome pulls back the robots but then, what's this? An army of XCOM soldiers rip the poor robots to shreds.  The robot survivor reported to Rome that Russia has taken over the middle-eastern regions and pushed toward Europe, with Rome being the meat shield of Germany. Caesar looks at his ally and goes 'Wait, what?' and was suddenly silenced when a reign of nuclear warheads wipe out his only defending army. Cities tremble under Russian troops who then surround the German capital. Germany goes and askes if there can be peace. Catherine then gives out a 'lol nope' then proceeds to demolish the capital with it's main army on the OTHER SIDE OF THE CONTINENT...  Great game, nice AI, interesting terrain, awesome gameplay.",

            "review_text": "With many games more and more emphasizing adrenaline-pumping action, playing a slower paced strategy game like Civilization can be refreshing. Indeed, Civilization V is the kind of game you can sit down, popcorn and soda in hand, and become completely engrossed in political crises, border tensions, and epic battles. While it may not train your reflexes or aiming abilities, you'll certainly find yourself performing insane feats of balance as you try to maintain your Civilization's military defense, culture, scientific advancement, religious development, and economic power. You'll find a game that is admittedly not immediately exciting, but which will involve the player in incredibly complex situations, never playing out the same way each time, always offering a new story.  However, there are some valid criticisms worth considering. I will address two primary problems with the game that are connected to smaller issues others have brought up. Firstly, much depth and complexity present in Civilization IV has been stripped from the game, and it shows. In Civilization IV, leaders acted very often according to their historical personalities -- Gandhi would have an aversion to war, wheras Genghis Khan might be attracted to the possibility -- in Civ V, Gandhi will happily crush your entire country to seize your spice resources. The hostility and viciousness of the AI in Civ V, by contrast, detracts from the game's believability. Besides the hostility of the computer players, they are also gloriously stupid, they make insane trade offers, demand whole cities in wartime when they are losing, and capitulate in war when they have the advantage. As deep and involving as the game is, the AI manages to detract from the experience often enough to be worth mentioning.  The second criticism worth considering is that too often it breaks the spell of depth and plays more like a strategy game. It IS a strategy game yes, but the game is also about civilization, and how complex and wonderfully intertesting human society can be, and sometimes the play to win mentality that is inherent in the game (especially it's AI) as well as many of the players can weaken the game's ability to absorb the player into the story of human civilization.  Beyond these criticisms, the game presents itself well, the interface is much cleaner compared to previous iterations in the series, and the warfare much more interesting. In previous titles, units could be stacked on top of one another, so often the winning of wars came down to who had the most material power to build the biggest unit stacks. As a result of the removal of unit stacking, material power will help, but an ability to position units correctly and actually strategize will win you the battle even in the event you are outnumbered. Thus Civilization V may rightly boast of having the best combat and warfare the series has seen.   However shallow the game can be at its' worst, it's intensely engaging and dramatic in the most positive sense at its' best -- every action that is simple or basic in one game is dramatically important in Civilization. For example, moving units close to another Civilization's borders, somewhat tedious and uninteresting at face value, raises the tension as you prepare for an epic war against their evil, imperialistic civilization. In the context of world civilizations, all actions become pronounced and important -- helping the game tell a story of warring global civilizations in crisis rather than simply telling the story of a competitive match between two players, each trying to win.   That dramatic worldly context is what allows the game to tell such interesting new stories upon each playthrough and definitely what makes the game so incredibly addicting, involving, and engaging. Despite the admittedly valid criticisms, I couldn't possibly recommend this game more.",

Civilization V was my first civ game, mostly because it was the first I thought I could learn to play in a day. Civ V even forgoes traditional tutorials and teaches you as you play with help messages. The game is big enough last you dozens of hours of gameplay before it start getting repetitive and if you get hooked you can play it for years. There's a big and traditional community that produces good mods or stuff like Giant Multiplayer Robot that allows asynchronous play. most of DLC is hit of miss but I'd say Brave New World is a must have and I won't ever play this game without it.

It has one more turn factor which makes you want to keep playing even when you already won.  Sid Meier's Civilization V has very deep and challenging gameplay. You start from scratch with only a settler and a warrior, build your first capital city, then keep building up your nation/empire. From the dark age of 4000 BC, the dawn of human civilization to the modern globalization age of 2000 AD, you forge your empire from a single capital city and then expand and build more city, do research to strengthen your empire in all aspect, create military power for defense purpose or go on a global conquest, and manage your national economy, culture and diplomacy with other faction. Every unit can be leveled up just like an RPG games which make every unit is unique and count. You can even rename those unit when they level up to make them a little more personal. Choose your own path for your civilization, war, peace, culture, science, all will lead you to great victory.  Sid Meier's Civilization V has good graphics quality overall. The maps are beautiful. Unit and city has quite good detail. The UI is also great, you can switch between tactical and world map view.  This game is very great and addicting. Sometimes which is most of the times, even if you already won the game, you still continue playing it. I recommend this.  Rating 9/10",

I was hella wrong. Theres a really nice feel and charm to watching your units fight it out, esp sending bombers to far away cities, or maybe a nuke. Sending some crossbowman to rain arrows down on bandits, or parachuting marines across Islands and so on.. The fights just taking place on the campaign maps also lets the game be extremely well polished as its just one genre/area to work on, unlike say the TotalWars which are real-time and turn-based in one, and leads to a jack of all trades but master of none, as we all know how janky the TW series is.

            "review_text": "There's no other game quite like it (even EU IV/CK). Has a lower learning curve in comparison, but it's still a sizable beast to conquer; there are lots of intricate mechanics and strategies you can find yourself learning hundreds of hours into the game. Oh, and it takes forever to finish a game even on Quick so if you're the impatient type, this game may not be for you unless you go Duel/Quick every game.  MP is fun. AI becomes much too predictable, so introducing the unpredictability of human thinking into the equation naturally mixes things up. The team mechanics for Co-op are interesting at first, but besides sharing beakers for research, there really isn't much to it and you often end up fighting for things like wonders, land and city-states like any competitor would. Also, no achievements can be unlocked through MP (except the one...), which is mind-boggling. As someone who dislikes the AI, it is annoying having to jump back into SP to get the achievements I would otherwise have received through normal play.  Balance wise, there are some aspects that could be improved; there are obviously superior wonders, civs, even resources (I'm looking at you, salt), as well as obviously inferior ones like Angkor Wat, Denmark and most of the plantation luxuries. Some units also have pretty crappy ugprade routes -- Pikeman, the most accessible and strongest Medieval melee unit suddenly becomes an at-best situational anti-cavalry Lancer, and the Crossbowman, also the most accessible and strongest Medieval ranged unit becomes a one range Gatling Gun. Range is huge in this game, so increasing the damage in compensation for the lost one tile of range is like cutting someone, then offering them a band-aid.   Technical specifications wise, the graphics are a nice upgrade from IV (and for a game released in 2010, it's fair). Some of the music is pretty awesome, but they're easily forgettable and as I already listen to other music while I'm playing, turning off the music hasn't impacted me at all.   All in all, a 9/10. I know most of my review has been negative, but anything not mentioned here, I generally endorse.

            "review_text": "Civilization V. I've played it first when it was 2011, brought from si drek's copy of the game. It was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s (I think that's the name) pirated version of the game. I copied it to my Acer Travelmate laptop along with the better (at that time) games: CoD 4, Torchlight II, Borderlands 2 and some other games I can't quite remember. Yes, I got the game because 'alang2'. Didn't thought much about it.  After some time has passed, I’ve decided to test the Civ (I’ll be calling it Civ from now on) game because why not. A whim is a whim. Double clicked the executable and the game launched. Clicked quick game because testing was my mindset and I probably don’t need that much time playing Civ. The first I noticed (apart from the terrible fps and horrendous graphics due to low settings) is that Civ 5 is a TURN-BASED game. I chuckled. “Who the ♥♥♥♥ plays a turn-based game this day of age. I swear this is some kind of mobile port”. Nevertheless, I continued playing and looked at the time, “What? How long have I been playing!?”  Yes the appeal of the game, ‘ONE MORE TURN’; never have I played a game of Civ and stopping midway through (only on some very special occasions like ISUK SKULAH). It’s fun, it’s addictive, just one more turn.  I can’t really say for sure (but I totally can) why I think that Civ is a great game but I’ll just list down some key features and describe my experience from there:    It is a strategy game. I’m a sucker for strategy games. Needless to say I have spent vast amount of my time wrecking my little brother in Command and Conquer 3: Kane’s Wrath and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (this is how I’ve started playing DOTA 2 but that’s for another time). All the micro-managing, the turtling, the base race, the resource scavenging is fun for me to say the least.    The turn-based system is actually good. Yes, I chuckled at the turn-based stuff previously but now I am fine with it. Taking turns managing your empire really makes you think before you press the ‘end turn’ button. Where should I explore? Should I declare a war? Should I create an alliance? Do bribe the small city-state? How much army should I produce? Which technology should I research for after this? Questions, questions. It’s fun when you see your sprawling empire went to the direction you lead it. All it takes is for you to plan before you press that button.    Your empire is not bound by the civilization you choose. This means that if you ever chose Gandhi (an Indian civilization) and went for the Science Victory (with population growth) but failed midway, you can change the destiny of your empire with swords and dominate the playing field if you choose your cards correctly. Heck, you can even be a Mongolian Khan era scholar with a belief in Protestantism and ideology in communism.    The mechanics is very 4X mechanics I don’t really know what game mechanics mean so forgive me if I'm interpreting it wrongly. The game is simple (haha, this is a joke). Click on a unit. Click on anything. ♥♥♥♥ is done. But really what you do is you find a good spot for your settler to create your very first city (if you turned off start bias or just don’t like where you spawned), train some scouts and go explore the world. The game uses hex tiles that determines what you stepped on. In perspective, your unit is on a tile surrounded by 6 other tiles (hex = hexagon, not voodoo stuff). Notice that each tile can be of different terrain which provides bonuses or really weird stuffs.    The A.I. is intelligent for starters. To be fair, it depends on your difficulty. Settler being the easiest, Prince being ‘normal’ and Deity being super hard. Settler difficulty provides you with massive bonuses for you empire and the A.I. is dumb as ♥♥♥♥ (also the A.I. gets a disadvantage). The bonuses lessen with higher difficulty and stops at Prince where you don’t get any bonuses and so does the A.I (the A.I is somewhat reasonable. This is where i ‘calibrated’ at) you’re facing against. Starting after the Prince difficulty, you get a disadvantage and the A.I gets the bonuses with Deity being extreme. The A.I. is hard to beat and get massive bonuses such as researched technologies, happiness ++, etc. whereas you get basically the opposite of that because ♥♥♥♥ you says the developers (joking).    All the other stuff I like the graphics (on high settings). It’s nice to look at. It’s nice to see my empire actually evolving with age (visually). Also the addition of faith and spyware (lol) really makes the game feel complete. I like my empire Islam based with communist ideology and nuking everybody one turn before I won the game. The game is not bound by one victory type like other strategy games, where you need to wipeout the enemy with you army to win. You can win culturally, scientifically, politically, timely or the barbaric dominatingly.   It feels like I haven’t said enough about this game actually but I’m lazy halfway through so you get what you get what I post what I feel. I need also to mention my gripes with the game. Just one.   THE AIR UNITS ARE SLOW AS ♥♥♥♥. WTF 2K SPEED UP THE AIRPLANES PLS, I LIKE MY BOMBS FAST AS ♥♥♥♥   except the atomic bomb because slow imminent death to my enemies feels good.  tl;dr Great game.

I suggest you to buy the whole thing or not buying it at all since without the expansions there will be no religion, no espionage and the diplomacy will be pretty broken too, making the game kind of unplayable.  Three weak spots:  1-You can not found companies like in CIvilization IV Beyond the Sword.   2-Edit: Warmongering is super tricky and difficult now.  3-The 'Empire happiness' system was improved a lot but it's still illogical, since every city should have his own level of happiness like in Civilization III or Civilization IV, you could have an empire happiness level system but it should be regulated from the individual level of happiness of every city.  Let's say you have an empire with 2 cities, Lisboa and Oporto. If Oporto is under siege it's logical that the happiness of Oporto drops and than that deteriorates it's growth, commerce and productivity but why should Lisboa which is very far away from the warfront be upset about it? Let's be real, every city has it's own problems, should there be factors that deteriorate the happiness of ALL cities? YES, like nuclear war, declaring war against civilizations with the same idiology or religion but happiness should not be only global, the fact that you build a circus in Oporto does not make Lisboa any better, it makes no sense. If Lisboa is overpopulated let Lisboa be upset and unhappy about it but it's madness that because one overpopulated city the whole productivity of your empire drops.  Said that, this game is good stuff, good graphics, good combat system (even better that Civilization IV), decent diplomacy, no bugs at all, very nice multiplayer, all civilizations are good but England and France.",

The game is too heavily slanted towards other victory acheivements; it is too difficult to conquer cities and happiness makes a global conquest strategy through military might nigh impossible because eventually your armies will simply be spread too thin and enemies will too easily be able to reinforce their positions on large maps. I still recommend it though for 4K people, but coming from a Command &amp; Conquer/Starcraft/Warcraft background, I can't get out of the conquest mindset and the other strategies aren't to my taste.

Exploration is always fun. Seeking ruins, meeting city states, fending off barbarians and eventually finding your opponents is great. The reasearch tree in this game makes it incredibly difficult to choose: Do I build up my military tech, increase my gold income, push for some good culture wonders, increase my science, grow my city... etc. and every play can be done differently. I have a favourite tech path due to familiarity, but if needed, I will take any road. The variety in strategy for early game exploration, mid game conquests and late game domination is incredibe. I bought this game on the suggestion of a friend and it was the best money I have spent on a game. Do I recommend Civ 5? YES! GET THE GAME! PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!

And there is welcome, but not critical, DLC.  What I love about this version: hex-based game board for more natural movement. No more stacks of doom. Global happiness. No tech trading. Drastically improved AI relations. Improved event notification system means you never miss a beat.  What I dislike: The tech tree has been significantly flattened from Civ 4. Tech and Culture victories are terribly boring to achieve: hunker down, press 'next turn', repeat 200 times. Overreliance on gold farming to buy off all problems.

            "review_text": "It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.   Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?   It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.  ----o0o----    As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.   '...What's that smell?'   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.   Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You  ..okay?'  Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.  ----o0o----    Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.   About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.   Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(",

            "review_text": "What more can be send about argumentatively the most addictive game series ever? Coining the phrase 'just one more turn', the Civilization series has a track record of stealing precious hours from its enthralled fans. I started out with Civ 2 and was instantly hooked, helpless to its alluring and seductive gameplay.   I resisted buying Civ 5 for so long. I loved Civ 4, and played it so much that I decided to give the series a break for a while. That turned out to be years, with the occasional game here and there. I could no longer resist when I saw the Civ 5: complete bundle on sale for $12 earlier this year. In terms of value of content, it doesn't get much better than this!  I'm sure many of you reading this are familiar with the game mechanics. Civ 5 has simplified aspects of the game from Civ 4, which actually has made the game better in many ways. For example, I used to get frustrated with the number of units a player could stack up on a single tile. I found it to be deceptive, as only one unit type would show up on the tile. Thankfully, Civ 5 only allows one unit to occupy a tile. Thank you, Sid! There are other changes, but for the purpose of this review I will stop myself.  Although the game is already 6 years old, the graphics are still great! The soundtrack is also at a very high standard; I would be happy to listen to the opening music for hours. The music in the game is equally as good, giving the player always something nice to listen to.   If you are a Civ fan and haven't bought this yet, do! If you are new to the series and unsure, I suggest buying the Civ 5: Complete bundle when on sale. The expansion packs and dlc adds even more gameplay elements, scenarios, and maps (to an already huge offering!). The only thing that should be a decisive factor is whether you have the time to play it. If you enjoy brilliant turn-based strategy games, once you start a game you won't have much time for much else!  Buy it at your own peril! I'll give Civ 6 another few years...",

You play as the leader of a civilization, such as; Ramses, Washington, Khan, and must develop your civilization to grow and settle new area's, including through diplomatic, economic, or military means. There are several conditions for victory you can play toward, and each turn represents several years in your civilizations time. Civilization V also has a new feature known as City-States, individual settlements, who are independent of the computer controlled civilizations, and operate as their own entities, making alliances, declaring war etc.   Having had limited experience with the series, only playing Civ 3 for less than an hour several years ago, I came into Civ V with little expectations. I found it to be relatively easy to learn, the tutorial process and advisor tips help shorten the learning curve, and is actually fun. I found the AI to be interesting, as each player civilization and city-state has it's own personality. I haven't tried any of the Downloadable content, such as; Gods and Kings, or Brave New World; However, I can assume they only add to the fun you will have with Civilization V.   Normally, I don't care for turn-based games and prefer real-time strategy, but Civilization V was a pleasant surprise. It was easy to learn, graphically, it looks a lot like the Total War games. If you like turn-based strategy games in the 4x genre, give this one a try.",

Civilization 5 is a strategy game about controling an empire throughout human history-from the settling of the first towns to the near future, and is fun in every part. The game manages to have the same concepts at all times, but still having different flavors depending on how far into a game you are.  Great: Incredible amount of Content-doing everything the game has to offer is next to impossible. On top of this the game is very addictive, with stuff going on constantly to keep you hooked.  Good: Game Concepts are very well made with one exception, and the game looks very nice and has a fitting art style. Combat is much more refined than past Civ games, ommiting the 'Stack of Death' involving placing 30 units into one tile and bashing a city for minutes until one unit happens to win.  Bad: Vanilla version of the game is lacking. Not to say it's bad, but the Complete Version for 50$ is far superior. And 50 dollars is a lot compared to some other options.   Also, the happiness concept is a bit flawed. Having an unhappy civilization all but stops expanison, causing cities to not grow and also giving you a economic and military penalty. In order to keep a civilization happy, you must find luxury resources, which may be inacessible to you without a crazy amount of effort or trading, or may be right on your doorstep. Also, the AI seems to get a Happiness Bonus, who rarely have a problem with the unruly masses. It's kind of unfair.  Ugly: The game is a bit unstable and is prone to crashing. I can't play on full screen, as my GPU becomes overused and the game needs to shut down. Other crashes are seemingly random, with little to no explanation on why.  tl;dr: It's good. Crashes sometimes, but it's good. 9/10  Oh yeah, I'd get the Civilization SDK (Whatever that stands for) Along with this in the game tools section of Steam. It's a game editing tool that allows for Map Creation and making your own Mods.",

The only thing I would really say was bad in this game is the multiplayer. I strongly advise you just make a game with freinds and organize it if you want to have a successful online game. If you want to just play with anyone you want then it will probably crash or people will quit.   Overall this game is a 9/10",

Totally worth a little reading time.  Very few games out there keep me playing after the main objective has been met. I can't even properly describe why... why I can't stop. Once you get past the initial learning curve it becomes seductively simple and almost hypnotic. You'll be all like, 'Hey, I can have this running and do a turn here and there while I'm getting on with something else'... 4 hours later... 'I'll do it in a minute, just one more turn...'  Graphically, it's a pleasant enough mask for the clever mechanics. Many ways to play and win. Nice array of buildings and units, Stealth and Nuclear Missile being my favourites... 'Oh! Hello. Looking round my border are we? BOOM! ¡SƎHƆ┴Iq I'll melt your faces off and rub my butt all over your tiles!' The UI is uncluttered and easy to find your way around. Tooltips and tutorial messages and in-game help are surprisingly helpful. The community is active and awesomely creative. The achievements are plentiful but stretched across DLCs.

The music and little dings of accomplishments are extremely gratifying.  Tons of mods available to boost gameplay, although if you have the complete edition or even just a few pieces of dlc there is easily over 200+ hours of gameplay and many many more hours, of replayability due to the sheer amount of leaders, strategies, map sizes, and ways to win in this game.   Cons: if you honestly do not have time to play games, then this may not be for you, although you can save and dive back in at a later date, if you are anything like I am you like to invest hours into a game at single sittings, and not have to wait a few weeks to reach whichever point you desire.  The game is also easily addicting, I have found myself waking up in the morning wanting to come play this game straight away with friends rather than do day to day activities, on a few occasians even blowing friends off.   Overall Civ 5, is intricate, complex, and simple. The game is very gratifying very quickly, and forces you to use your mind in even basic decisions. While also in some minor ways teaching you political aspects I believe many do not understand today. Computers with direct x 9 or higher can play, meaning it is pretty machine friendly, easy to pick up and put down and come back to pick up again. And due to the graphics, and sheer amount of possibilities, I see this as a game that ages extremely well, even if multiplayer dies 'which currently is very alive and vibrant.'

If you're interested because you've heard of the potential hilarity that can ensue, this certainly has it.  The worldbuilder DSK that comes with the game is also very enjoyable, especially if you're a writer or an artist. It's a great source of inspiration.",

I do not run this on a laptop or a toaster either, it does this on optimized specs.  Now, let me tell you why you should buy it anyway. The big frustration of this game is that it really is just that fun. When you crash out and lose a lot of time and effort (just save your game before ending every single turn. Every Turn.

            "review_text": "On it's own, Sid Meier's Civilization® V is hard to recommend. It's missing quite a lot of really nice features and the AI works poorly. However, with the Brave New World expansion, or even with Gods and Kings (both of which can be acquired in the Complete Edition), I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly interested in turn-based 4X games.   Gameplay: Civilization V is a very easy game to learn. It doesn't have complex mechanics that are difficult to understand, nor does it have detailed diplomacy with hundreds of possible options. It is incredibly easy to get into. However, don't be fooled into thinking that the game has no depth. There are a many strategies that can be used to achieve the various victories.  For example, you may be trying to get your technology further ahead of everyone else, either to peacefully achieve the science victory, or to crush your enemies with a more advanced military. There are still many other options available, such are culture, which gives you buffs in areas of your choice, religion, which you can spread to enemy cities to recieve bonuses, NPC city states with quests that you can befriend, ally with or destroy, getting high amounts of gold and buying the favour of other players.  And that's not all. Every single civilization has a different passive bonus as well as 2 special units or buildings. This allows for more varied play styles aswell as more specialised games.  Japan, for example, has a special bonus which make it's units fight as though they were at full strength even when hurt. This means that they excel in combat. A player playing Japan may wish to go down the route of conqueror. However they also acquire culture from fishing boats. This means that players will actively search for good spots near the coast to settle cities where as with a different civilization they may have prefered to stay inland.  This provides plenty of replayability. With a total of 43 civilizations, there is more than enough choice for you to find your prefered playstyle.   Graphics: The graphics of Sid Meier's Civilization® V will not blow you away. That said, it still looks good and there is a lot of detail put in. Special buildings and wonders that you construct are actually visible in your cities (though not always well placed, eg. the pyramids being half submerged in sea water). The animation and combat looks nice, however for multiplayer I recommend turning the animations off as it both wastes time and can sometimes cause lag if your internet speed isn't great.   Performance: With graphics on low, this game will run on most computers, even really old, barely functioning laptops. Again, if your PC is less than stellar I recommend turning off combat and movement animations as they are not important and not having them doesn't take away from the overall experience, Multiplayer is where this game both shines and suffers. It's quite difficult to get a multiplayer game with many players working properly without lag. However, if you are able to get it working, you're going to have a great time.  EDIT: A patch has fixed most multiplayer issues. While I have not tested with more than 4 people, I can confirm that the game runs smoother with 4 people after the patch with 2 people before.   Mods: This game has plenty of mods available. Mods that add new civilizations, new resources, new units, visual overhauls, new maps etc. However, while some of them mods may be great, they can only be played in single player. There is no option to use mods in multiplayer.   Overall, Sid Meier's Civilization® V is a fantastic game. Once you start playing you will not want to stop. Even when it's time to save and quit, there will only be one thing on your mind: Just... One... More... Turn.",

I bought the game for about €30 euro and gave it around 70 hours. Then A Brave New World came out and of course I had to buy that. And somehow Civilization grew on me.  With the help of a friend who is MUCH better then I am I was able to stop playing in Prince difficulty. Somehow from there the hours slipped away from me. At one point I found myself awake at 2am with a head cold planning to expand my empire on a map I had already dominated. I had won yet I needed all my people to have Public Schools and Stealth Bombers.  This game does a very good job of conveying how countries rise and fall. Kind of. It was a surprisingly new idea for me that a country can start in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation and somehow rise out of the ashes thanks to the fall of other countries.  Now if you've read this far down down you will have been disappointed to see no may-may about Gandhi and nukes or something bizarre that happened out of context.

I also cannot stress enough the roleplaying potentials of this game, especially when you are playing with a group of friends. The only thing that could be improved is the artificial intelligence since it can be predictable and basic. The multiplayer interface and overall framerate of the game could be improved as well, and made more efficient to reduce the lag and delay when playing with many people or civilizations in a single game since it can slow things down and make turns take a longer than usual amount of time.",

Sid Meier's Civilization® V boasts detailed and sometimes, glorious graphics(like natural wonders for instance), while much of the game's ingame music makes your Civ V experience feel epic at times, with the 'Brave New World' DLC theme being one of my favourite music pieces from video games. If you feel that beautiful graphics are your 'gaming fetish', you might find Civ V to suit your liking, otherwise choose other games.  2. Civ V's ingame mechanics, such as being able to choose different game speeds(which affect the amount of time needed to complete an action), rock-paper-scissors unit vulnerabilities and benefits, leveling up of units to make them stronger in certain aspects, routes to advance your civilization in various elements of the game, etc. There is way too many mechanics to learn about Civ V, but I am a total noob so my opinion may be unjustified.",

Special highlights for me are being the dominant political force through control of city states, taking Poland into space, and winning a 1v1 game very quickly as Atilla. So much content and so many wonders to build. Certainly a brilliant game.  If you have ever wanted to play a CIV game, Brave New World is a great place to start.",

I would turn on my computer first thing in the morning because the night before i'd come up with a new 'scenario' (way id like to play). Then i would proceed to carry out the actions nessasary to bring said senario to it's climax. The premice in my mind was to take the question 'how can i bring about this one specific moment, and play it out effectively?' After said moment i rarely had the stomache to 'grind' through to victory. Who cares though, i had gotten what i wanted, but not exactly as i had planned... The AI ruthlessly manuvers its-self to victory. Are you weak? Your getting attacked bro. Are you strong? Your getting out teched Sis. Stray too far from your capitol for an expansion, good luck. The good lands are coveted by all, and any excuse will do for the Ai to war with you. Especially land. Manage an increasingly complex empire to your mental drugery breaking point. Don't get me wrong, this game is a masterpiece, but any egoic desire to win will ruin all the fun. Just play how you want, die, learn how to play how you want effectively, get lucky, celebrate your advantage as long as its still fun. Then start another one. And another, and another.  In short, lots to learn lots of tweaks to improve gameplay a game that is litterally endless (see if you can get all your 30 second ideas played out over the months) All problems can be managed Nothing an autosave cant fix ;) Great distraction from any otherwise productive use of your time  Buy this game, play this game, love this game, and at the end of the day get your irl priorites strait through that sinking feeling in your chest that says my life is meaningless, but don't put a gun to your head. Remember its just a game, youll get through this.   Are you a Civ-aholic? You could be! It's that good! Like all good things in life, if you arent carefull it can ruin your life. I suppose its healthier to learn this from a game as opposed to drugs and alcohol, but those things will get you laid more thats for sure. Even moderation in moderation, go on blow a month or so on a Civ binge and learn how to manage your life, via the loss of every minute of time you can spare to the monkey overlord on your back.   Do yourself a favor, get your video game addiction over with. Thats what this is gonna do for you, nothing will ever be the same.",

This turn based stratagy game lets you take on the role of a leader of a nation and let you manage all aspects of the nation, from diplomacy to economics. The game leads you through the technological advancements of mankind and will let the wars waged go from man wearing clubs to aircraft carriers with fighter planes.  The management is very in depth and there are many ways you can manage your civilisation and lead your people to victory. A small example is that you can let your city construct wonders of the world that take up a lot of production time or can say 'I do not want to waste time on that' and focus on developing the infrastructures and or armies of your nation.  There are to many aspects to praise in this game. And I have played civ 1 back in the day... this game has come allong way and I will gladly see this game be rememberd as a great game.   Story/plot: 8/10   This is a hard one, since the story/plot is history replayed by you. Therefor I will rate this based on accuracy on history. The game follows the history books and is therefor spot on. But since it does not really have its own story to tell I cannot give it a 9,5/10 but I will go with a 8/10  Diversity in ai: 8/10   The AI reacts on dilpomatic discisions of the player, knows how to do an attack and has moods programmed into it. Solid and since the update quiet a while ago ... I have no bad things to say about it. Mechanics: 9/10 [/b] Solic mechanics, very in depth managing so thats the best part of this game. And its what makes the game so addictive.  Environment: 7/10   The variaty of tiles is great, but the different arts for the same tile seems limited.   Voice Acting: 8,5/10  The voice acting for the english version is great, calming voice for narratives and the authenthic languages for the leaders really is a plus in my book.  Flexible story: N/A  [/u] Overal: 8,5 [/u]    On the side note I have played more then my currently displayed time, but this was all BEFORE steam.

Once you get past that roadblock though, this becomes one of the most fun games to play. It goes from 12 AM, waking up, getting on civ thinking that you will play only a couple turns. Suddenly, next thing you know, its 12 PM, and an entire days worth of time just flew away out of nowhere. The game's mechanics make this kind of gameplay VERY common. By making it a turn based game, you will find yourself saying 'I'll quit in a few turns when I build this wonder.' Then, after you build the Wonder, turns have passed and maybe you meet a new civilization from exploring. Then it turns into 'I'll quit once I start trading with this new civ.' This happens over, and over, and over again. During the entire thing you will almost always be intrigued as to what is happening while also having fun.(Especially in the later eras of the game) In conclusion, Sid Meier's Civilization V is a very fun, very addictive turn base strategy game that will always have you clicking 'Next Turn'",

The gameplay itself is great and though I have had problems with saves once or twice, the overall experience is one I haven't shared with any other game. Of course, with any good game comes some flaws. The most prominent flaws I found were the 30 FPS, which wasn't noticeable until someone pointed it out to me, and the AI difficulty system. Civilization 5 used a system, where instead of having more realistic, violent, or all around better AI, the AI was just given varying degrees of resources, military power and interactions. I also found that for most players difficulty 3 or 4 work best. One of the more aggravating parts of the game were relations with other civilizations/city states. I found that once you became a large world power, most civilizations tend to become 'Guarded' against you. While playing with the DLC “Brave New World”, I became so enraged towards a different civilization for having more delegates than me and hosting the world congress, because of the delegate system, I promptly attacked them and hosted the event. Overall it is still my favorite game and I would sincerely recommend purchasing the Brave New World DLC with it.",

The soundtrack is beautiful. In peace time, the music will be very upbeat, or even majestic depending on which civ you play. (I once chose to play as Germany solely because of their 'Ode to Joy' track that plays in peace time.) And in war time, the music gets gloomy and slow. This game I got during a sale a few months back. I was very skeptical on if I would enjoy it or not. I. Have. The sheer amount of content this game offers was greatly worth the $7.50 I bought the Gold Edition for during the sale, aqnd Brave New World for $29.99 (Could have been cheaper, but I don't regret the purchase.)

My ancient Russian hermit scouts who'd walked around the world twice smacked his galdiators to death with their canes so he surrendered. Pedro waged war on me and twenty years later he had one city left and I was in possession of his capital. Another few hundred years later, I killed him once and for all. I then procceeded to conquer the world, brutally slaughtering all other people, and creating the most powerful economy of them all.

I'm terrible at strategy games and this game is like a simple version of Europa Universalis and that's why I like it. This game is for those people who want a good game but is not as advanced and as complicated as Europa. Now for me, since I'm crap I play with mods, lots of mods. The mods are great, even the developers were nice enough to add a mod menu so installation can be easier. I just love this game, units look great, animations are fantastic, a helpful encyclopedia, and of course the barbarians. Don't forget about the civs and city states. They way you can interact with civs and city states is just wonderful. You can be allies, friends, and do quests to improve relations, and of course WAR. Sometimes civs can be fed up with another civ and ask you to help him defeat them, and city states tell to take over other ones. It is just a great system they've added. Oh my goodness the music, the wonderful music. It makes the whole game not boring. Like the music just makes you want to play more, and it fits the civ you play as. As for the difficulty level in this game I can't really say anything about since, like I said before I'm crap at strategy games. So the highest difficulty level I played was prince mode so judge me all you like. Some civs have certain benefits that they get and to tell you some are not the best, so choose wisely. There are ideologies, culture, faith, and religion. You can make your religion part of your empire and name it anything you like. You can make lots of cities, build the buildings, build wonders, research technology, improve resources, use your social polices, and spread your culture. You can produce units and make them help your empire grow and defeat your enemies. Graphics look great, you can make wonders, built good buildings, have a strong military, conquer the lands, and of course make your empire go down in history as the most strongest. Or won the space race and build a spaceship to go to outer-space. Also has the most culture, or have strong relations with every empire. Oh yeah there are many ways of being victorious, 4 in total. A Science victory, Culture victory, Faith, and Domination. Just remember this game is not realistic as or intended to be. Well it's a bit realistic with the Archeology. Also the benefits with the civs. Alright the things I wish to improve about this game are the realistic spawn points and dates, that leaders die and new ones take there place, wars happened between civs as in real life, the date when their empire were defeated, their behavior, wonders only if they were the original creators, and of course the city states to be more realistic. It's 2016 ingame and barbarians are still called barbarians. Why aren't they called terrorists or something of that nature. But the rating I'm giving this game is a...8/10. There is so much more I didn't talke about. Yes the game is old but give it a go. Just watch a youtube video on it, you'll get the hang of it.",

I have few complaints about the game--The automated city manager is adequate, alliances with the AI seem hardly useful (you hit endgame and they will backstab you. Or maybe that's just Korea's MO. in. EVERY. GAME), and it appears you can game the new combat system something fierce (I field at most 3-7 units to defend my empire, regardless of empire size).

Of course, the gameplay is mostly not new but there are a lot of new aspects and improvements to justify buying this one even if you already own the already brilliant Civ IV; especially the new strategic aspects from the non-ability to stack units and hexagonal fields was a welcome change.  The only thing I don't like is a late period in every game session when everything seems to kind of drag along, but I guess that's only because of the way I play (slowly expand and tend to my cities and later build an army and conquer everything ^^ That's the part that's fun but drags along and gets old fast...)  I have to admit, I haven't even ever played Civ in multiplayer, so I can't say anything about that...  8,5/10  PS: I find the two addons pretty expensive but to be honest, they don't add anything I find essential to enjoy the game.

However, they have decided to censor swearing in the reviews. So, I guess either I have to cool it a little, or you guys have to start figuring out what I mean by '♥♥♥♥'; so y'all ♥♥♥♥♥s better get real good at seeing the difference between hearts. Let's get started.  Imagine that you're a citizen of the United States of America, or the United Kingdom, or maybe even Russia, and you want to control your country as they kick ♥♥♥ in World War II (ADDITIONAL FEATURE: If you're from Russia, you can also fabricate a false history in which Russia doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing suck from it's creation until present day.).  You get to control a country from start to finish, doing as you please. You can focus on science, religion, warfare, or anything else. You can take over other empires, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ churches and burning women. You have a huge-♥♥♥-nigger-♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥♥ing-♥♥♥♥-load-bag-of-♥♥♥♥♥s-and-♥♥♥♥-festivities-and-giant-♥♥♥♥♥ amount of control in this game, and can rule how you please.   Although Civilization V sacrifices historical accuracy for the sake of a good gaming experience, it does include some nods to the real empires of history, such as civilization-exclusive units. You can change the settings for a game or choose pre-made scenarios if you want more historically accurate gameplay, and you can play through real events, such as the fall of Rome.  In conclusion, although I'm not a fan of the strategy genre, this game's addictive gameplay, endless replayability, and vast array of features earn it a 9/10 in my book.",

            "review_text": "Addicting.   That's my one-word concept for this review. Sid Meier's Civilization V is addicting. It's like a drug. You try it for the first time, and you like it a little, and tell yourself, 'I can quit any time I want.' Then, a week and 5 Civ sessions later, you find yourself spouting the game's mantra, 'Just... One... More... Turn.'  The gameplay is fun and inviting, in the early stages of the game. Lack of proper preparation can get you killed on the harder difficulty levels, but it's pretty forgiving on the easier difficulties. And there is something oh so satisfying about ruling an entire empire, especially in the later portions of the game, when you have the entire world at your fingertips.  The graphics are much improved over previous iterations of the game. The new hexagon tile system works better than the old square based system as well. The AI is also better, though still frustratingly simple-minded. The amount of times they've declared war on me for the simple act of making friends with other city-states is astounding.  Speaking of, city-states are a worthwhile entry into the series. They add an entire new element, giving you someone to barter with or an extra thorn in your side, depending on how you play the game. They can mostly be manipulated at will, but the ease with which an enemy civilization can bring them into a war effort against you can be alarming. Most of the time, they don't factor into a war very much, but occasionally they will send out a unit to battle.  Overall, this game is fun, inventive, and rewarding to play. But all of that only really tells you one thing: this game is...  Addictive.",

Nice gameplay, superb detail and graphics, plus the accuracy of AI leader personalities (based on history) really gives you that great feeling leading your chosen civilization to glory.

Especially so to Strategy games as it is my favored genre and, therefore, I am extremely picky about which ones I enjoy. Now, one look at my Steam Library will probably tell you exactly what style of Strategy games I enjoy (RTS). Simply put, I have never really liked Turn Based combat in any form. I can appreciate things like X-Com, and get the appeal to Pokemon and Final Fantasy, but I really just don't like turn based combat in any form. This game, however, has altered my oppinion of Turn Based Strategy completely.   I wish there was more to say, but there are just so few words to describe this game well enough. The soundtrack is excellent, the gameplay is truly addictive and has depth the size of the Marianna Trench. The level designs are randomized in most cases, meaning that you'll literally never replay the same campaign ever unless you play one of the presets. The AI can be randomized as well. Throw all this into one bowl, add in rpg-like elements to build an empire that's truly yours, a political and economic system that puts EVE online to shame, and a simple, sleek, beautiful, easy to understand UI that feels like butter on your eyesockets and you still won't be able to grasp the perfection of this game.  For those of you blessed to live near an IN-N-Out burger, imagine you've just been told that you can now have free infinite IN-N-Out Burgers and fries for life. The feeling of your taste buds erupting at the thought of all that burgery goodness is the equivelant of playing this game for ten minutes.   In summary: Stop reading and buy this game you filthy peasant.    And don't trust Ghandi   ",

Civilization V is simple enough to learn in a quick game or two, however offers enough micro-manageable options in order to be completely customizable both pre-game and in-game.  This game caters to any play style, and you can adjust nearly anything you want. From game speed, map size, and map type to what resource focus to put your capital on and where to build a city to benefit you the most, the game offers nearly endless amounts of customization and micro-management.  I strongly suggest the purchase of the Gods &amp; Kings expansion and/or the Brave New World expansion along with this game. They add much more features to make your Civ 5 experience as enjoyable as possible.  Lastly, you do not require any special talent in reaction time, and you do not require 'an eagle's eye' to play.

At the moment I'm roughly a bit more than 200 hours into the game, which is personally a lot of time for me, and I still play several turns each week.   Pros:  + [Laptops] Does not require a mouse; playable on the go. I frequently travel by train and whenever it takes a while I grab my laptop and fire up Civ. + A large variety of civilizations to toy with, even more when you purchase DLC and expansion packs, with each their Unique Buildings, Units and Traits. + Four speed options for the patient and less patient ones (Me. I tried marathon mode, big mistake, but my OCD kicked in and I just had to finish it.) + A large amount of mechanics, the game is complex, but it's a great once you get the hang of everything. + For those who crave knowledge; the game gives accurate information about the civilizations, units and buildings. + Playable on tablets.   Cons  - Might feel repetitive for some - Noob-unfriendly IMO, I wouldn't try playing on 'Normal' mode (Prince) or Online if you're not familiar to Civ or the strategy genre.  - Time consuming, be prepared to lose a lot of time playing this game (and maybe some sleep once you get hooked) - Waging war with an AI on lower difficulty levels may be very boring and feel ridiculously easy. It's common knowledge among players that the AI is terrible naval warfare   Conclusion  Civlization V is not a game for those who crave intense action and immediate results. Civ V is for those who like to put their brain to work and play that chesslike 'One step ahead' way, where a grave error can actually screw up your whole game. To the strategists out there I'd highly recommend the game and it's certainly worth its price.  I avoid rating simply because a rating mostly doesn't do anything justice. A tip: Don't buy games or watch films just based on a rating and actually read reviews if you wish to consider something, you might bump into lots of cool things that are supposedly considered bad.  Though if I were to actually rate Civ I'd say a 9.5/10   N.B.:  I mentioned as one of the pros that Civilization is playable on tablets. Normally this is not possible if you have an Android tablet or iPad, but there is a way to stream your PC to a tablet using Splashtop, which is available for both Anrdoid and Apple products. There are several guides available online on how to do this.",

And it’s this thrill of not knowing that really lets me enjoy the game.  Even with the numerous strategies a player can choose from and/or alternate between, there are also a number of side activities to do such as building up the cities themselves with new architecture or researching technologies to give yourself an edge via the most high tech gadgets a person can have. You can also interact with city states and build relationships with them for passing their borders or getting resources from them and some resources are only gotten from these city states.

I first bought this game before the BNW expansion, and I thought that the game was a well rounded game, but also that I would never want to play the game in it's purely vanilla version, as I had Gods and Kings at the time. The Christmas after BNW's release, I owned all of the expansions and DLC for this game, and it felt totally complete. The GUI and whole presentation is very crisp and charming, with a 'Strategic Mode' which transforms the game's aesthetic into that of a beautiful board game, which I often employ, to the chagrin of my friends that I play with. The improved BNW culture victory is very fulfilling to achieve now, as well as the improved Diplomatic victory, which is far better than the UN wonder that Vanilla Civ offers. The diversity of playstyles that can be utilized with the many civs included, and even of playstyles for each individual civ. Every game feels unique, and this game has made me into an avid fan of the Turn-Based Strategy genre, and I believe that anyone with an interest in history or in strategy will find this game to be very enjoyable. 9/10 when full, 5/10 w/out DLC.

            "review_text": "One of the things I really like about Civ V is that it has evolved substantially from the version dropped on release day. Patch after patch, expansion after expansion, Civ V has steadily and significantly improved. Personally, I hated it at first. I wanted Civ IV with better graphics. I hated the hex based combat, I hated that religion and espionage were removed, and I hated that someone seemed to have turned the AI leaders into sub literate psychopaths.   After a few games and a few patches I really started to like it. By the time Gods &amp; Kings dropped I was hooked.   The game really shines when you dig into the mechanics a bit. Keep your workers on manual control, don't let the incompetent AI manage your cities, and always keep some well trained soldiers on hand. If you keep control of your Civ's infrastructure you will have plenty of freedom to play and win how you want. Gorgeous visuals and music that varies from soaring anthems to eye twitchingly repetitive. In other words, its Civ. You will love and you will play it and YOU. WILL. NEVER. STOP. Ahem...  The only negatives for me are the AI and the newest expansion, Brave New World.   The AI isn't really as pants-on-head crazy as it was at launch, but you will rarely be able to forge the game-long solid alliances and friendships you could in Civs II-IV. I suspect this is a design choice. Civ V is a bit more of a game than a simulation, and the goal of the AI is to win the game as opposed to simulate realistic behavior. So occasionally your ally with two cities and outdated technology will gamble that it can slow your roll by throwing its laughably inferior troops at your machine gun nests instead of safely maintaining the two millenia of peace and prosperity it enjoyed as your ally. The AI just doesn't want to let you win, YMMV as to whether this is a deal breaker.   Brave New World is not really endearing itself to me yet. End game has always dragged on a bit, and always devolves to the point where you are just pressing enter until you reach your victory condition. BNW tries to mitigate this by adding some new systems to the late game, but personally I find them a bit bothersome. I like some micromanagment, but BNW just gets so fiddly I end up just rolling my eyes a bit.  Still a great game. Buy it. Buy it now.",

The multiplayer is always fun, and the singleplayer is not bad also. Would recommend to anyone of any experience level with PC gaming.",

Watching your City and units grow larger and 'cooler' is cool. ",

I ended up getting hooked to it. I enjoyed it so much, my older brother had decided to get me some of the expansions. It's amazingly simple to figure out, and you can get the hang of it fast. I had no idea how to play the game when I first started, but with time I was able to figure it out.  Pros: ~Has a really great tutorial for new players to help learn the mechanics of the game. ~Huge range of civilizations and unique stats for each. ~Tons of different maps and game styles. ~Able to played with friends or AI. ~Wonderful mods on the Workshop.  Cons: ~Some of the mods don't always install properly(Not really their fault). ~Easy to get addicted to and lose track of time. ~If you're on a team with other AI when you're at war and about to take a city, they will steal it from you.",

It accomplishes this by using a turn based system that always leaves you dissatisfied with your stop point, no matter where that may be. If you find yourself wondering, 'Gee, I have so much free time. I sure wish there was a single game i could spend stupid amounts of time on.' Then this is the game for you my friend.  Side effects include:One turnitis, Sleepless nights, Lowered job/school performance, sudden marital problems, faux historical knowledge, misunderstandings of how politics work, and tacking question marks onto the end of statements.    On a serious note: This game is a simple entry level 4X game. If youre new to the genre this is the place to start. Do not buy the base game; instead wait for a sale on the expnsion and DLC as it improves the game tenfold. Due to the long turn timers this game is best played while talking/texting a friend, watching TV, Surfing the web (especially if you're running dual moniters), or even playing a mobile game. I dont think there is any game i have personally played more and i wholeheartedly recommend it.   9.2/10",

They lived in modern-day Slovakia and were known for their discoveries in geology, astronomy and primitive electricity. Not only were they great poets, they also developed one of the first successful constitutional monarchies. If they had enough room to fit in pointless civilizations like the U.S, why didn't they add in Emperor V and his civilization to this game? This seems like some type of passive-aggressive racial exclusion to me.
