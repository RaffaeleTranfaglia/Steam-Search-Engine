    "description": "Returning from Sunday fishing, you find yourself in center of the zombie apocalypse. Scuttling, you stumble upon a broken army jeep with weapons, equipment and coordinates of the nearest shelter. It is there that you have to get to, making your way through a forest full of zombies, marauders and fellow-sufferers.",
