            "review_text": "This is probably the worst 'tower defense' game I've played. The terrible mechanics and ridiculously unbalanced nature of it make it ruh-tard easy and boring. Literally all the unlocks in about 8 hours of IDLE play, yes IDLE, the actual playing is done after about 2-3 hours and even that is just accomplished by clicking back and forth between 2 tiles with one unit. The rest is upgrades for the first 8 waves then wander off to do something else because there is literally nothing else to do but wait for the level to end, since it pauses if it loses focus I just stuck it in a VM and randomly check on it to change mission or click the keep playing button. Surely nightmare or the challenge modes are harder, nope just as easy and idle. Glad this was free but I feel bad for anyone that actually threw money at these devs, this is a lazy cash grab game.",

            "review_text": "I do like the structure of this game but it also has a few faults, i like the tree for tech seems decent balanced but, what ever guy does the most damage you have is auto targeted so snipers with only 300 hp die off constantly while your front line tank shoters end up ignored, this type of inbalance in the ai targeting leads to end up using only tanks, cause you cant offord to keep replacing things constantly. I rate this game over all 3/10 mainly due to how the zombies target makign early fighting a real pain and turning in to a constant replacing of units cause front line units hitting them are ignored.",

            "review_text": "I'll be the first to admit that this game has warts.  1), The playing field is so close, that frequently the limits of your weapon ranges go beyond your point of view. The limits to the display do  not  add atmosphere, they make me feel cheated!!!  2). The game speed controls do  not  show up when beginning a level as a default. The default is to hide the pause.  3). Navigation is limited.  After all of this, I must admit that the game is engrossing enough that I played it for five hours straight. It definitely needs work, but the price is right.  Now if I can find a zombie survival game, that lets you regain hit points by eating zombies.",
