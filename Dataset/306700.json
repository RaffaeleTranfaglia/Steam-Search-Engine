            "review_text": "As many of the other reviews have stated, Iron Fisticle is similar to classic arcade games such as Robotron and Smash TV.  This is a twin-stick shooter. You go in a room. You kill everything. You move onto the next.  In a number of ways, this game is designed to follow Smash TV's template. Your throwing axe isn't particularly good, so you have to take every chance to get hold of the good (but temporary) weapons. This changes things from merely being about slaughter to carving a path to the next weapon, all just to capture those precious seconds of relative safety. In terms of aesthetics and mechanics, Iron Fisticle is quite appealing. The graphics are nice and clean, resembling something from the Toaplan age. The controls are perfectly solid, and the hit-box is suitable for what needs to be done. This makes for an easy game to just pick up, play, and enjoy.   This game certainly isn't as difficult as Smash TV. As the store description goes, you can level-up to boost your health, abilities, and unlock new &amp; items and weapons. Unlike seemingly every other rogue-like on Steam, these level-ups are permanent. You're free to purchase stat upgrades, so you'll start the next game with a nice boost. HP-restoring hearts are very prevalent as well. If you're particularly adept at the platforming bonus rounds, you can grab a full-healing before your next stage. Is it all really necessary? Yes and no.  In standard rogue-like fashion, merely beating the game isn't enough. Sure you might have defeated some great evil and saved the legendary turnip or radish or whatever the hell it is. However, when you've accomplished your task, you get kicked back to the beginning. Everything is a little more difficult now, and your luck will run out eventually. Now here's where things get interesting. Aside from Smash TV, Iron Fisticle also takes ideas from Bubble Bobble.  Within each stage, you'll find the silver weapon-holding chests, but you'll also collect a myriad of items that award points. Zombies drop food, which can award up to 800 points each. There are also special items, that are found in gold chests (one per stage). Sometimes the right special item can make a huge difference, and so can finding the right weapons. This adds a slight luck factor to the whole affair. Your dodging skills might be adept, but weapons are what keep you from getting cornered and overwhelmed. There is a dash move, which is pretty useful. However, zombies eventually roll extremely deep, and you could end up dashing into a crowd.   So for most players, beating the game isn't much trouble, but going for those pesky leaderboard spots will cause headaches. Theoretically you could beat the game an innumerable amount of times without dying, but you're always one streak of bad luck away from death. If you want the top score, you'll have to play for a several hours straight. This can get pretty dull, since you'll be so strong the first 30 minutes or so won't pose any threat. Last I checked, the top-score was around 8 million, that's at least 8 play-throughs in a row. Mercifully, the challenge mode is only four stages, though luck still plays a slight factor due to food-drops and other potential bonus points (and using spare iron fists to milk the 'hurry-up' golems). There's also playing for the shortest time, which has some merit as well.   Whatever the case, Iron Fisticle's long-term replay value isn't very high. Once you hit max level (which doesn't take very long) there aren't many incentives to play the game. The normal mode takes too long to become interesting, and there's a little too much randomness to make playing for score very compelling in the challenge mode. Even with that in mind, I still give this game a recommendation. It is fun, well-constructed, and does an admirable job of blending the design philosophies of multiple classic arcade games.",

It's not a bad game - I don't regret my purchase - but, there are many better twin stick shooters out there. It's a quick and decently fun game with a few irritating quirks. The sample videos on the storefront are pretty explanatory of the gameplay.  Cons: Keyboard controls are bad (don't bother playing if you don't have a gamepad) You can only shoot in 8 directions which felt weird Only local co-op Enemy AI is non-existent  If you have the chance to pick this up during a steam sale for about $2 I'd say go for it if you're at all interested in this type of game. If you are in desperate need of a new twin stick shooter then pick it up. You'll probably get ~4-5 hours of gameplay out of it with some occasionaly games after that maybe if you want a quick time waste. For someone on the fence about purchasing or for someone looking for a new Binding of Isaac, look elsewhere.",

Picking up huge cakes for 1,000 points while blasting skeletons in a graveyard has never been this much fun. I will be playing this through solidly in one-player and be forcing my family and friends to co-op with me in two-player. It's excellent.",

The sprites, interface, and environment are all done in a low-res, pixel style, but the overall effect with the lighting and compositing gives it a warm, lush feel (as opposed to the rough feel of many pixel style games).  Audio - 9/10 The music and sound effects are all top notch, and blend well together.  Gameplay - 9/10 Tight controls, and the pacing and balance of the monster swarms is perfect. The randomized rogue-like levels keep it interesting, and the persistent upgrade system keeps me coming back.",

Keyboard play is basically impossible on a normal keyboard, since there's no mouseaim and it needs to bind both a 4-way move and 4-way shoot, plus it's possible to want to move diagonally while also shooting diagonally. Most keyboards do not do a good job of four simultaneous inputs.  It also couldn't read my non-XInput gamepad directly, so I ended up using JoyToKey to have the gamepad trigger the keyboard controls. It ended up being worth the hassle, but don't get this game if you don't have a gamepad at all.",

There were some initial problems with getting controllers to work with two people, I think that has been resolved. I bought a pair Logitech controllers to make this work, but it didn't the first time. I think everything is fixed now, so a solid coop game is yours to enjoy.",
