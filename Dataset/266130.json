            "review_text": "Not bad, but it feels so unfinished, it pegs itself out to be a military training tool during the games intro sequence and it isn't, it's an unfinished game. Don't buy the DLC either, it sucks in every possible way, unless you like having green blobs and red blobs moving about a blue screen.  The gameplay is entertaining enough, you can set field of view and there is a bit of a tactical element but you can't prioratize targets, you can't tell your men to throw a grenade then move in after it goes off (leading to several instances where one man has thrown a grenade and the other instead of waiting then moving has charged in and blown himself up) and you can't use any form of snake camera to peak through doors.   Purchasing weapons is stupid. first you complete missions in the fastest time possible to unlock the 4 star rating, then you need several thousand £££ to buy the gun and the accessories like scope, suppresor, light ect. with the most expensive accessory being superior to the others in every way leading you to wonder why they included the possiblity you'd buy one of the ♥♥♥♥♥ier ones.   The stats for the guns vary wildly, with the FN P90 being far far less accurate than a shotgun which is more accurate than the first few assault rifles you unlock and the TAR21 being as accurate as a sniper rifle.  The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and comes in one variety, so long as you set your field of view to point at them, even on the hardest difficulty, you will win relativley easily.  The levels begin to all feel the same and use the same level design for all three modes of play. this is only broken up by the fact a harder difficulty means more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies and enemy placement is slighlty random (you play the same level more than oce and you know there will be 2 enemies in that room somewhere but are they stood near the coffee table or that bookcase 4ft away) There are enough levels that this isn't a problem though.  The tips that appear during loading screens sometimes seem to refer to elements of the game that don't even exist, stating their is a ranger training mode that all teams can participate in when thier isn't. When it doesn't gives these tips it provides out of date or incorrect 'facts' about the military groups you can play as.  And to top it all off this game is no longer being developed so all these problems will remain, have fun getting used to them.  ",

            "review_text": "Firstly it's important to note that contrary to its advertising and the game's intro, Breach &amp; Clear is not a simulation. The game has more in common with call of duty scenarios than real life counter terrorism operations. Soldiers acquire perks and weapons are only effective a fraction of the range of their real life counter parts. It would also be hard to argue that the soldier classes bear much in common with real life soldier roles instead displaying strange attributes like the intelligence specialist's ability to disappear.  The combat itself is fast paced and interesting. It doesn't often feel cheap except when your squad isn't leveled enough to tackle a map. There aren't any game breaking flaws in the combat system which is more than most tactical level turn based combat games can boost. The game offers incentives to use fire and movement realistically and the ability to flank and suppress means the player has to keep their team on the move. Perma death thankfully can be enabled which gives a lot more weight to the player's decisions. The game uses a WEGO system for the turns but you'll hardly notice because the AI doesn't move around much.  Enemy classes don't offer huge variation but they do provide enough to allow the designers to create some interesting tactical puzzles. Heavily armoured soldiers can cause your team serious trouble if they can close with them and snipers obviously operate at the other end of the spectrum.  The graphics are quite nice with your soldiers displaying the weapons and gear you issued them with. Everything is clear and easy to interpret except some more obvious fog of war would be nice so players would be provided with some idea of which areas had been cleared. The spotting system is balls, soldiers can see through walls and some items completely negate the fog of war completely. This game certainly could have taken a few lessons from the original Xcom in that department.  The level design is often pretty good but the game's original platform holds it back. Maps are too small and quite clearly were designed with short playtimes in mind. They get better as the game goes on but it feels a bit strange that multi story buildings are absent and the game's attempts to emulate this by making assaults on large buildings take up multiple missions doesn't really feel convincing. The game modes provided are Terrorist hunt, bomb diffusal and escape which are all pretty much self explanatory. They all change up the maps slightly but in the long term aren't enough to keep things from going stale. Bomb diffusal maps feature the ever annoying enemy reinforcement spawns that are the bane of several srpgs but within the context of this game they work extremely well and give the mode a bit more tension.  The game tries to keep the player's interest by offering what seems at first to be extensive customization options, but realistically half the weapons and gear offered aren't ever really going to come in useful. The outfitting screen could also do with some work as no indication is given how prospective weapon and gear purchases differ from what is already equipped(unless you click back through some menus). Unequipping all the modifications off a weapon can be quite tedious as well.  Besides tactical combat, the game doesn't offer much else and what's there feels somewhat lacking. The potential of the system is never fully explored because the maps never really get that big and the squad size stays at four men. Insertion methods never change with rappling and helicopter assaults never making an appearance. This lack of variation results in the game getting a bit stale after a while.  It can feel a bit half ♥♥♥♥♥ at times too with some design choices(no ability to use smoke is the most glaring one)leading to the player's units taking unavoidable damage in some situations.  That said fire and movement in the title generally works well and dumb tactics are often punished. The market isn't exactly swimming in squad level turn based strategy games so this is a welcome addition.",

There is quite a bit of customization for your weapons, gear giving buffs and negatives to stats. The game also features a lot of real world high-end small arms.  There is currently about dozen different level sets, all with unique tilesets and progressively varying terrain and baddies. several different difficulty settings, a lot of replay value I've also found thus far.  Mission rewards are dependent on performance, basic indicators. Hardcore &amp; Softcore character deaths are avialable- Die forever or just for the mission depending on how you want your squad to be.  Several country SF are avialable for squad creation (more then one squad avialable at a time), each seem to get their countries rifle/basic eqp. of choice in the beginning, which is good attention to detail.  If you really liked the core combat system of Xcom, and can for-go all the base building as well as Sci-Fi elements and go for just character customization and being in the current era. I do also recommend it if it goes on sale and any one likes a good RPG-TurnBased-SquadCombat game.",

When it finally came out for Android, I bought it (a second time) only to find it was slow, poorly optimized, choppy, and hard to play. I gave them a pass, since it is hard to optimize for all the different Android devices out there. But I should have taken a hint.   The PC version, from what I can tell, is the tablet version with mouse controls. Woohoo. Everything is way too large, the graphics are unchanged, textures are horrific. It also sucks to start over each time you change devices, as the game is very 'grindy' to get new stuff (expecially when you've beaten all the maps before and are just going through the motions).   Overall, when a PC port comes out, at a higher price, I expect something new, not just a ported control scheme. I'd take a refund if I could, but this being Steam there's no chance of that.",

They solved my problem easily,. It took awhile,. but better late than never.

            "review_text": "Breach and Clear is good for what it is, a squad level turn based strategy game(though it meshes real time mechanics into it). That's the short version.  The long version is that this game does well to cover a market that really isn't thriving right now. For so long strategy games have been more about commanding large armies rather than smaller squad levels of highly specialized soldiers. The few that do attempt this are either outdated or poorly executed. Breach and Clear provides a breath of fresh air to a genre that seemed stuck for a long time.  I will admit, the gameplay is rather simpe and somewhat repetitive, but still will suit true strategy/military genre fans out there. You are allowed to control 4 man squads of some of the world's best specialized combatants (American Special Forces, Army Rangers, Navy SEALs; German KSK; British S.A.S.; Russian Spetsnaz; Canadian JTF2). In this squad creation of whatever force you decided to pick(you cannot mix and match, if you pick Rangers, all four members of that squad are Rangers, but you can create multiple squads), you create four operators each with default skills and loadouts(the loadout is by default the M4A1 SOPMOD, the skills vary somewhat based on what kind of force you pick. Special Forces, for example, will have higher health stats by default). Upon creating a squad, each member of the team you create must be assigned a role, and depending on this role he will have special abilities and skills(the fireteam leader provides bonuses to his squad as well as being able to draw enemy fire, for example). As you complete missions, your soldiers will earn experience, thus allowing them to upgrade certain stats, such as health, movement speed, accuracy, etc. Also, with each successful mission, you earn moeny to buy new gear and weapons for your operators(only qualm I have about the guns is that they are almost all American used weapons, most of which AR-15 derivatives, so there's not a whole lot of variation there).  When you start a mission, you are given an aerial view of the area of operation(this is the main viewpoint for te entire game). This will allow you to examine the area before sending your guys in. Once content with what you see, you can select which entry points you want your guys to stack up on(most maps will have at least two entry points, though there are several that have just one). You can divide your team to tackle multiple entries and cover more ground, or you can keep your units together and lessen the risk of one of them going down. When you send the guys in, you have a movement stage, where you coordinate where you want your guys to go, what direction they cover, what actions they should do, etc. Once you got all that figured out, you can execute, and your guys will follow your orders to the best of their ability. Be mindful, when you activate this and they start moving, the enemy starts moving to, and will therefore react to your guys, this is where turn based strategy meshes with real time strategy. Assuming that your team is well equiped and your tactics are sound, you should be able to complete the missions without many casualties.  So the gameplay, unfortunately, doesn't vary much. The same principle is applied over and over. But the gameplay is solid and once again those who enjoy this kind of commanding style will be pleased. Overall, I'd give it a solid B rating. Could be more varied in terms of gameplay mechanics, but what it does offer is well rounded and well executed.",

Your team can be chosen from many different, not just regular SWAT unit, but US Seals, russian Spetsnaz, JTF and much more. Possibility to camouflage them from several different variants, name them as you like (glory to my SG team :) ) and hooray to battle.

The weapons are balanced and there are several nice levels which can be enjoyed in 3 modes: Terrorist hunt (kill everybody), Bomb Defusal, survival/escape.   Graphics are decent but not eye-popping. Far from it, actually. The human models all look pretty much the same even if you select different characters. Mediocre at best and could have used a more vivid style and color palette.   The gameplay itself is turn based tactical battles. about 70% of the maps are indoors and use tight corridors and covers to keep the action pumping and the rest are outdoors which focus more on tactical play and choosing the best ways to strike.  Your squad of 4 (which you can create yourself and customize) level up as you gain more stars in missions and more XP. You also receive money to purchase new weapon upgrades and gear. You choose specifically which attribute to level up for each soldier (e.g. accuracy, speed, special ability, reaction etc.). This all helps to give the game longevity as well as harder difficulty settings which make the game much more demanding. I'd also like to note that the music is pretty cool.  I only wish there was a 'Restart Level' button in the pause menu because you need to go back to the main menu every time you choose to restart a level mid play.  All in all, a great bargain game and I'd say it's worth the full price even though there aren't many maps to play around in (there are new ones in a DLC though).

            "review_text": "Let me begin by saying that this game is alright. There isn't anything seriously bad about it, but there isn't much that is great either.  I bought this game during a sale for less than $5.00 and I don't think I would have paid more for it.  It's fun little game, but it feels just a step above a java game that you could play on your browser. It's pretty addicting just like some of those simple games are as well.  I haven't played a game like this before, but I hear that there are similar ones with more depth.  --WHO THIS GAME IS FOR-- Someone who is just interested in some casual tactical gaming. Pleased enough with moderate strategy gaming.  The Good:  ++Levels aren't dreadfully long (about 6 minutes) but there are 7 countries to visit, each with 5 levels to play in. Also 3 game modes (Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, and Escape Plan) using same maps, This may not seem like alot but it manages to have just enough variety ++There are a lot of options with costomization and I've found myself really thinking about my purchases for guns.  --However, there is a problem with costomization that I will get into later ++Option to play with Permanent death of squad members to earn extra XP (You get a replacement if one dies but you have to rank them back up) You keep the dead members expensive weapon equipment, which is good.  ++Upgrading skills for your soldiers is pretty solid with the variety of options (Responce, Accuracy, Health, Speed, Evation and an Skill that goes with the soldier's role; Like Squad Leader gets leadership skill you can upgrade). Not too easy to upgrade but not too hard.  ++I like that you can assign roles to your 4 person squad (Leader, Medic, Breach, ect) and that they get perks unlocked as you level up.   The Bad:  I'm going to begine with the costomization options ++There are MANY different guns (some same price and same specs though)  On the guns you can pack them with Optics, Lasers, Grips, Flashlights, Supressors, Gas System, and Triggers The problem is that There are only a handful of attatchments in each category and it's easy to max out on the Optics, Lasers, Grips, Flashlights. There are no tactical thinking involved in these options because they only improve accuracy and have no negatives, so you don't weigh your options. -It's pretty mindless --The good thing is that Suppressors, Gas Systems, and Triggers provide certain pros and cons that make you consider what perks you want and the expense of something. There are vests and other things but to buy that are important, but there are many items like clothing, goggles and facepaint that provide NO perks.  ++The Main Menu is slow and kinda laggy and brings a bad first impression when you put your mouse over a button and it takes 3 seconds for it to light up. The response when you select it is absolutely normal. But makes the game seem cheap.  ++The strategy is pretty basic. I've only felt trapped and in trouble a few times. The gameplay is mostly all about keeping your guys near cover and know how to split up your guys (which isn't challenging)  If you 4 star all the maps as you progress Like I do and not jump ahead two counties (with harder soldiers) it doesn't stay very challenging. (I went two counties ahead and within two moves I was surounded and lost a guy right when he got shot at) -RIP Brett Breachers  ++I'm playing the levels in Germany, (which is the 4th country) and the environment is pretty static. Only a few levels actually had 1-3 of the soldiers walking around in real time as you plan out your strategy.   THE UGLY ++The ugly part isn't in the gameplay. It is with selecting items in the market and selecting the items when you choose a new gun or add attatchments.  +The interface with the Market and costomization is terrible.  +When I purchase a new gun I have to make sure to detatch everything on the previous gun, and there isn't any fast/easy way to do it (Such as putting a small 'x' in the corner). I have to select the icon individually for Lasers, Optics, Grips ect. THEN select to 'unequip' this gets very Tedious when there are 7 attachment types.  +The interface only shows you the picture of what items are attached to your gun with no name of them or what their specs are.  +You have to go to unequip it and then mouse over it to view its specs.  +Another problem is that it doesn't tell you the name of what gun your soldier is equiped with. You have to memorize its shape and look in the market so you can compare it to a new weapon.  +When you want to compare weapons in the market you can't do it side by side. You have to click the gun, then scoll down/up the list to view the next one. That is teious as well.   CONCLUSION: I give the game a 6.5/10 -Would not pay $15.00, wait for a sale of less than $7 if you aren't sure about this. Addicting to play but almost too simple to call it a strategy game.   +It needs improvements to make the game more interesting and needs its interface to be changed.  +Would be interesting to add multiplayer of terrorists vs Spec Ops. Where each team has to make their moves and then it plays out.  +Another request would be to add new scenarios (This might be later in the maps, IDK yet) with a less static environment and enemies. Like Helicopter, or enemies driving in the stronghold with vehicles.",

It plays like XCom or Jagged Alliance with the turn based stop and go action and each character having their own allotted movement pool; however, unlike other games, it doesn't restrict your shooting. My SAS team moves to the limits of their allowance and leaves a trail of bodies behind them. I don't sacrifice movement to be able to shoot. Possibly i should really have to consider reloading enroute (it would be more realistic) but the great limiter is whether you push too far and find yourself in a firefight with a crowd (or simply shot by some swine standing behind a door). The more you restrict the length of movement the more the team moves together and 'owns every angle' (not entirely sure i'm comfortable witht that phrase yet). Your team levels individually, with XP discrepency based on their own number of kills and you have stats you can spend points into. Most are stats they all have but specialists have one unique skill each - medic with healing for example. You also earn money for completed missions with which you buy gear. Gear upgrades are very like Call of Duty or Payday - new triggers, foregrips, armour pieces etc, each adding or subtracting from important stats (max health, noise, accuracy, movement speed etc). You also get to buy your guys sunglasses or facepaint which has no value other than to make you the most fashion concious special forces team. After only 5 or 6 games i found myself investing in gear and going back to the starter missions to improve the speed of the assault and to up the difficulty levels - completely loving it :)",

Some of the aspects are not nearly realistic enough to make it a simulator or training tool. Some graphical glitches are really annoying but I managed to get rid of most of them them by turning the graphics down so meh. The game may lack content and variety which is why the price tag isn't very justifiable but if its on sale then it might be worth a purchase.",

You can choose from different roles and customize your character. The gameplay itself is pretty solid too.  But it could be better, the game lacks a lot of things, like:  More weapon variety, most guns are rifles based of the american M4 or other similar guns. Only one PDW (P90) no MP5 or Mp7 only one sniper (an artic warfare i think) (with no real sniper role). Gameplay is very basic it lacks the option to set timers on waypoints for example so that your guys don't enter before a flash. It's basically just kick in that door, clear room, repeat. No rappeling down walls, no breaches trough windows (there are none) it's all basic. Graphics and effects are basic too (i miss some bullet holes, blood and destruction, would be a nice touch).  But the things that are there work and it'S entertainig for a while. I recommend buying it when it's on sale but don't expect too much!   To the developer: a stram workshop for this game would be awesome, we could make new maps, weapons etc.",
