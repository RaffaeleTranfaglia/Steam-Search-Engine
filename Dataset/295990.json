            "review_text": "As a big fan of city-builders and goals in games besides 'kill this' and 'destroy that,' I wish I could like Evopollution. But I can't recommend a game on its concept alone. There's not much content or gameplay; it mostly involves just sitting and waiting for your money to pile up enough to advance, with very little planning or strategy involved. I feel Evopollution would work much better as a free social media game.",

            "review_text": "A very strange game. Not what I really would describe as a business stratergy game myself. Its more of a puzzle game. I did have fun trying to workout what I had to do and seeing how the game worked but I dont think its got lasting appeal.  It in my opinon seems slightly unfinished and could have been alot more should the actually buisness side of things been deeper.  Overall I enjoyed my time with it and would suggest its something to pick up during a steam sale certainly not worth more than a couple of pounds.",

Sadly, this game doesn't appear to be going in any direction, which might be some sort of grander artistic statement about the natural resource industry... maybe... probably not.  In either case, this seemingly cute strategy game features almost as much gameplay as your typical mobile progress bar quest time-eater game, and largely feels incomplete with little hope for update.",

You buy structures and wait for your money to go up. That's it. The map generation is irrelevent; where you place structures is irrelevent.  This is an almost content-free game. Please don't buy it.",
