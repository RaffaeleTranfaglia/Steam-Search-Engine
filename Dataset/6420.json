            "review_text": "If someone would ask me 'Is this a good game?', my answer would be: 'Well, ... its how the big boys do battle!'   You dont know what im talking about? If you should play this game, you will. :)  Imagine this:   You are the Captain of a Heavy Cruiser. You are in a space fight. Its your ship against two others.  The difference: Your ship is not very manoeuvrable. Its a large vessel. The term 'Heavy' is no coincidence. The two enemies are smaller, Less powerfull, but more manoeuvrable.   So, Captain! Give some orders! What are we going to do?   You decide to go straight in. Shields up, Weapons up! Give them everything we got!   After a short time, you will realise, that this may not be very effective.   Well, Captain. We need a new plan. Decide!  'Plan B: First, we are using our lasers! Target for their shield device. Without shields, they are helpless.'  Here we go. We are firing. First hit. Second hit. Minor damage to their shield device. Looks good.  Then, our lasers stop firing.   Why?  Because, as mentioned, the enemies are more manoeuvrable than we are. They got behind your ship. And they keep firing.   (Note: The good thing is, you dont have to press any buttons to turn your ship around. Your ship will do this for you. Tell the ship where to go, and it will do so. Because if you would also have to navigate while fighting, this would turn into a mess ..... unless you are George Takei)   But here we go. Your Ship-AI activates your thrusters (Yes, you can see them doing so and it looks great). Your ship turns around. Target in front of us. First hit. Second hit. Third hit. Your lasers keep firing! HAHAHA! TAKE THIS YOU B*******! What? ...... no damage?   Why?  Well, the enemy ship did just turn around. The shield device is located at the top. Your lasers DID hit the target, but the wrong side. The lasers have no effect on the Hull and there is no shield device at the rear of that vessel.  The enemies keep firing.   'To Hell with them! Launch the Fighter Squadron!'  'But Sir, they .....' 'ATTACK!'   (Note: Fighters and Bombers are very effective in destroying devices. And they are fast. Rotation of enemy ships does not bother them)   Your fighters are going in.  'They wont know what hit them!'  Well .... your Officer tried to warn you. They have a laser flak system. Perfect for ........  AI Voice: 'Fighter Squadron lost!'   Did i mention, that the enemies kept firing?   Now you may say: 'What kind of idiot would do that?' I would say: 'Vice-Admiral Norbank!' :)   You will see.    There are a lot of things that can go wrong. Most of the time, it is your fault. But you will learn from your mistakes. After reloading, you will take down their flak and launch your fighters, or you will focus on their engines so that they wont be able to outmanoeuvre you.  Shields of the first ship are down? Let your laser aim for the devices of the second ship and activate your hull damaging weapons to finish the first one. There are a lot of possibilities.  There are situations, when you need a lot of patience. Even when flying trough space. Your ships wont charge in an instant after you gave the 'Move' command! They are Heavy Cruisers with Fusion Engines! What do you expect? It will take two seconds to heat up, then your ship will start moving.  Simple rule: The bigger they are, the slower they move.   Last words:  The Mission 'The Fight for Earth' was one of the most entertaining missions i have ever played in a Space-Sim. And it was one of the hardest missions in this game. (Dont worry, you WILL restart the mission if you play it for the first time) Advice: Dont start with the highest difficulty level. You wont stand a chance.   My opinion: Yes! It is a good game. I had a lot of fun playing it.  It is not a perfect game but it many good moments, it is entertaining (very important for a game) and it has an awesome 'Final' Battle. Therefore: 6.5 out of 10.",

I first stumbled on it was few months after its release. i bought the original CD pack &amp; played for some time but due to having a low performance pc, it soon get abandoned. then only few months ago destiny has brought me to it again in Steam.  i was really surprised that after such long years it's still available. so without any further thinking i bought &amp; installed into my new pc. It was a superb game back in 2005 when i still have the CD pack &amp; it still is a great game now in 2015.  i spent hours &amp; days on it, offline mode. It's awesome, the gameplay, the story, the designs of the ships etc etc.  it's simply the best game i've played in its category.",

The single best space game that I have ever played. It has the best engine ever made for starship combat unfortunately for whatever reason it didn't meet the sales that it needed at the time of it's inception so there's no hope for a sequel. There's plenty of mods that people love to play around with but the worst part about this game is that it ends.",

            "review_text": "I've played EVE on and off since 2007. So why do I prefer this game every day of the week? Realism. With all due respect to EVE and the understanding of technical limitations, etc: Nexus gave me what I needed. MMOs can be great, but for single-player this game is astounding.   Full ship module customization: from weapons to shields to support systems to engines to fighters and more. An actual visible shield bubble around your ship that flashes when hit by enemy energy weapons. The Combat and Deflection engines make for amazing moments, enabling you to narrowly dodge hundreds of battleship-class projectiles that would otherwise shred your frigates and destroyers. The ability to target specific enemy modules, and having to have a good scanner to detect a ship's weapons and systems in the first place. Great fleet battle command controls and more.   Unknown space anomalies, allies and enemies that actually make you go 'what the hell!?' A very frenetic but fantastic automated drone/fighter system as well. I'm not a rogue type of player in the least, yet I applaud the inclusion of various stealth drives, cloaking, ECM, ECCM, and even jamming shields. Did I mention how fantastic it is to view a ship taking hull damage, let alone the sectional explosions leading up to the ship explosion? And memorable stories &amp; characters to boot. Phenomenal.   An under-appreciated space combat game. If you're the kind of gamer that prefers more realism than just pure fantasy in your spaceship-combat games, this title may be for you. If you are considering this game and want to know more, PLEASE ask me. I swear by this game but I will also answer questions objectively.",

            "review_text": "i have not played through the game, but i figured id be a while anyway so i may as well put up an initial rewiew. i like it so far although it doesnt interact too well with windows 10. i would definitely love to see an HD reboot to make the game work and look better. not to mention the possibility of drumming up a crowd and some buzz for a sequel. UPDATE: I figured out the problems with Windows 10. Setting steam to run as administrator will fix any problems that ive been dealing with. Now to the game  The game is a very good game. I love playing it. its a little bit of a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ because the interface is old and not really fantastic, however the game makes up for it in interesting stories and trying something that was completely unusual in its time (and still is unusual even now although thats starting to change a bit). The game is challenging and ill admit ive started a second save because something I did in the past screwed me in the present. (i strongly suggest not overwriting old saves). Itll kick your â¥â¥â¥ a lot but it does so like an abusive spouse whose very good at it..... and youve got a thing for being abused.... youll love every minute of it even when its making you furious. Its weird like that.  I cant not reccomend this game. If you like a challenge, this game is for you. If you like an interesting story (even though it uses very old tropes and such) this game is for you. If you want a nostalgia trip, this game will be good for you.  Have fun!",

And this is coming from someone who loves the Homeworld franchise so you know this is some serious slow motion. The dialogue and backstory are actually somewhat intriguing (despite some pretty bad voice-acting from some of the characters), but any interest is lost only a couple missions in when the clunkiness of the interface and the speed of ships and action lingers on while you stare and watch for what feels like forever.  The interface is clean but unhelpful and tiny. Good luck trying to find your next objective or any object that the narration has mentioned if there are more than a couple things out there.  Graphics are serviceable and nice in some ways, but drab.  Most frustrating is that ships don't do what you'd like them to do. Tell them to stop, and they decide to move a little. Tell them to fire artillery and they move away from the enemy and don't seem to do anything.  Couldn't see any way to rebuild lost fighters, which seems incomprehensible.  Overall I was pulled in a bit by the story and atmosphere, but once the missions started my interest faded fast. I didn't play it long but can't find a reason to want to play it again.  I always hate to say that, being a developer myself and knowing that this game must have taken some good effort to create. But it's just not compelling.",
