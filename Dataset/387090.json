            "review_text": "A game with huge potential, a great core idea and a wealth of content sadly marred to unplayable levels by the sheer unusability of the interface. I would adore to see this tabletop become something playable, as with some better UI design and quality of life improvements it could become the best tabletop environment available, with a terrain creation system and features such as particle effects and populated loot boxes. Sadly at this stage due to the lack of uability, quality of life options and poor UI it is actually quicker and easier to make a battleground in any other tablwetop software (and some quick &amp; dirty 3d modelling suites) than to build something playable using this tool.  I really hope the tool can live up to it's potential but as of the time of writing I cannot recommend it and would advise waiting until it has been updated to become usable.  And to the developers, I know UI and QoL devving is the most tedious and boring part of development, but it really does make the difference between a classic and a steaming pile, and that goes double when developing a creation tool.",
