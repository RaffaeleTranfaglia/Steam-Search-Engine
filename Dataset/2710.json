            "review_text": "It is an awesome game, I brought it when it was released back in 2005.  Based on the novel of same name by Dale Brown. Act of war Direct Action is an engaging game. It tells a thrilling story of power, politics and terror of possible near future due to energy crisis.   like typical strategy game it has 3 factions; they are well balanced and have their respective preferred tactics on the field.  US Army: you can generally expect the units to be the best in its class but lacks diversity, take example of the M1 tank, which has highest HP and firepower. It is very straight forward, easy to manage, learn and use.   Task force Talon: simply put: Jack of all trade but master of none, many of its units can fill in multiple roles, for example the Spinner Drones, can switch between anti-tank and anti-air, as well as bomb drone. also rely heavly on infantry, It has best infantry in the early on.  Consortium: is a stealthy, high tech faction rely heavly on stealth and ambush tactics.   All 3 factions have its version of superweapons or in this game, called Tactical weapon. Each faction has its way to counter it.  It has innovative resource system where encourage you to capture enemy troops while protect your own from being captured. especially in later stage of game.  And remember the Live action cutscenes videos from Westwood Studio? Yup, this game has it.   It is, after all, a 2005 game, so don't expect to have top notch game engine of modern strategy game, but it is still impressive. This game has odd resolution options at today's standard and lacks wide screen support; however it shouldn't matter once you get used to it.   It suffered from technical issues regarding the memory addressing, but I believe it is fixed with latest patch as I was able to fire it up on my laptop which has i7 processor, 12GB of ram, nvidia GT735 graphic processor and runs windows 8.1.",

            "review_text": "Quite simply one of the most exciting strategy games I ever played so far. With a truly frightening possible scenario and excellent acting in the full motion video cutscenes, you'll think you're watching a movie. The game takes place in the near future where a worldwide energy crisis has pushed the price of gasoline to the high price of 7 dollars per gallon and the worldwide economy is in a tailspin that terrorists are quick to take advantage of and cause heavy losses. You play as Brigadier General Jason Richter, leader of the newly formed direct action operations group known as Task Force TALON that is charged with stopping the terrorists and also finding out who's backing them and stop them as well. The game plays out very much like the Command &amp; Conquer games and other similar titles with the fact that you build a base and then train units that you send out to exterminate the opposing forces, the units will also gain experience and become veterans that can take more damage while also at the same time dish out more. But one thing to note is that sometimes your infantry units, as well as those of the enemy, can become seriously injuried in the middle of battle and be incapacitated that can lead to them being captured unless they're healed by either a medic or taken to a hospital that you can construct. By capturing enemy infantry units and having a hospital in your base, you can gain another source of income, there's also banks and treasury buildings that can be garrisoned by both sides that will generate a set number of income until it is empty and when you're in the oil rich areas, you can get money from collecting the oil and bringing it to an oil refinery for cash. There are some sci-fi units here as well, like the Shield unit which is a form of exo-skeleton that comes equipped with a gatling gun for dealing with infantry units and a rocket pod for the vehicles and many others.",
