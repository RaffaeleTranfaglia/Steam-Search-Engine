            "review_text": "Alpha Protocol is a single player action RPG game with branching story dialogue based on your choices that will affect the way your game progresses and ends. The game has a modern spy movie setting ala James Bond/Mission Impossible. There are dossiers to read through, webs of secrets to uncover, and enough cloak and daggery to make you question who’s side you really are on and who is playing who, typical spy stuff.   HOW IS THIS AN RPG?: This type of action RPG game has a single hero, third person camera. You will earn level ups and have dozens of skills to choose from and have different weapons and gear to upgrade. Depending on how you approach some missions you will have access to side quests within your current mission that could potentially benefit you afterwards in areas such as the black market for example.  IS THIS A SANDBOX RPG?: The game is not a free roamer and is fairly straight forward to keep the story moving along, it is broken up into the main hubs of Saudi-Arabia, Rome, Moscow and Taipei. However the order of what areas you decide to visit are entirely up to you.  EXTENDED REPLAY VALUE!: Completed the game as the sneaky, non-lethal, silenced weapons, computer hacker, suave, smooth talker type? Why not try playing as the shoot first ask questions later, shotgun toting, explosives expert, confrontational, hard headed type? Or a mixture of both or something completely different. The game has multiple dialogue choices and event outcomes depending on what type of play style you go with. You will definitely get your money’s worth from Alpha Protocol if you decide to do multiple play throughs.  Admittedly most of my time spent on Alpha Protocol was on the PS3 and I basically did a speed run for nostalgia’s sake on the PC/Steam version. If this is your first time going through Alpha Protocol you are realistically looking at around 20+ hours give or take per go through.  It’s too bad SEGA didn’t commission a sequel to Alpha Protocol due to poor initial sales showings, but that shouldn’t deter you from experiencing this gem of a game, very underrated.",

While the concept seems original the execution could have been better, in short this is an Obsidian game, so it has all the trademarks of that developer, and they are: Great story with interesting characters, a very innovative dialogue system, good Rpg mechanics and a lot of decisions to make that affect your story in a hard way.  But as all the Obsidian games there are a lot of problems concerning gameplay. It has a stealth system that is very rough around the edges making it hard to go through a mission without being detected, a bad camera (which can be fixed for most of the time if you have a controller), a very basic level design and some bugs. Graphically i found the game to be inconsistent, while some characters are very well modeled some textures of the levels seem outdated. With all the problems i still say that this one was one of the most original games i ever played, if you are looking for an different type of RPG to play give this one a go and you can buy it cheap nowadays.",

            "review_text": "  The Good:    * Alpha Protocol is a unique 3rd-person-action/RPG hybrid. Truthfully, though, it caters more to the 'twitch' side of stealth than the 'methodical' side. Keep this in mind if you like your Stealth games slow or medium-paced.  * Alpha Protocol laid the groundwork for some of the games that you are playing right now. It is the reason current-gen iterations of Deus Ex, Borderlands, and Fallout exist in their current form. And, because of this groundwork, AP has similarities to all three of these series, but it is unfortunately a worse game.  * It is widely-reported that the game has a number of game-breaking bugs. This may have been true upon release, but is NOT true now. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs.  * The method of gameplay caters to the players' choice: it can be played multiple ways: run-n-gun, stealth, etc. However, playing with stealth is quite difficult compared to games like Metal Gear, Splinter Cell, or even Oblivion. This difficulty leads to many more twitchy fire fights than you would typically desire in a stealth game. And it's not a 'good' difficulty. It really feels cheap or unfair when the enemy detects me while I am in full camo in the dark, crouched and not moving.     The Bad:    * Most levels are essentially hallways, with only one or two alternative routes that can be used.  * Some animations are a bit stiff. For example, the open scene features your avatar's bicep and forearm occupying the same space at the same time. Enemies will also 'slide' into cover at times, and the normal guard's walking pace is way too low for the length of his stride.  * Character animations are incomplete. Most games feature some sort of 'turning' animation as your avatar changes direction. Turning is automatic in Alpha Protocol: your character is facing one direction and suddenly faces another direction.  * The computer hacking feature is definitely the dated relic of a game developed for a console. Rather than allowing a click and drag interface using the mouse, the player must move two 'passwords' across the screen using the keyboard for one and the mouse with the other. Although I have done a poor job of describing it, believe me that the interface feels dirty and and the controls are alarmingly poorly-designed.   * UI Features, such as the item selection menu, are a little unintuitive. They are confusing but are not hard to get used to.  * Pausing while in the middle of a conversation is really inconsistent. Sometimes the game allows you to pause, other times it doesn't. This is especially frustrating because the game allows you to choose what to say, and if you step away from your computer to give the baby a bottle, you may come back to a conversation headed in the completely wrong direction, essentially ruining your game up to that last checkpoint.  * On one mission I was instructed several times to use dust storms to hide my approach. There were no dust storms. On another mission I was told the sound of trains would disguise the noise of my bullets. The trains: they did nothing.  * Bugs encountered: (1) after dying, I loaded my last checkpoint and the game crashed. (2) On one mission, I found an invsible wall in the middle of a hallway, got my foot stuck in a rock, and found a health dispenser floating in mid-air. (3) It is impossible to do a stealth takedown on an enemy near a door, you will simply knock the door down instead of killing the enemy.    The Ugly:    * Alpha Protocol's method of encouraging the player to be stealthy works by making the combat mechanics horrible. One example of this is that in order to shoot accurately, you have to wait 4 or 5 seconds between each shot. Deliberately making your game worse to encourage a particular playstyle is a horrible idea, why did Obsidian think that would help their game?  * Playing the game 100%, or even 'somewhat fully,' requires lots of extra (boring) dialogue. Even worse, and the reason why I don't think this game will be remembered, is that the game 'features' hours of reading extra dossiers to find clues.    The Verdict:    * Alpha Protocol is neither solid nor decent, but a game that you may enjoy if you are a fan of Bioware or Bethesda games. The game is an interesting combination of stealth, gunplay, and mind-numbingly boring conversations and reading segments. I only recommend picking up this game if you are interested in game design so that you can see how pacing, genre-hybrids, and player agency became such important concepts in newer games. Alpha Protocol experimented with these methods and was successful in some ways and a complete failure in others.",

            "review_text": "Really fun game - would like to see more games of this type. Similar to Mass Effect (/ etc) in that it has a dialog wheel to choose various responses from, but it has the timed element from Telltale Games in here, too, so you have to choose fast.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward - you can run in and murder everything, or you can play in a more pacifist style, taking down enemies without killing them and without being seen. I feel this is probably the more 'fun' way to play the game, but you can certainly play it murder-hobo styles if you want.  Good variety of characters, though as I recall, it runs a little light on female characters that aren't also love interests.  And as with a lot of games like this (see: Deus Ex: HR), once you get   invisibility  , it rather trivialises a lot (but not all) of the game.",

The characters are unique and interesting without being over the top unbelievable and easily hateable caricatures. Decisions and choices make real meaningful impact throughout the game.  As for General gameplay, personally I thought it was good, fun, interesting and variable. I was easily engaged with everything the game offered and was easily able to keep playing and not get bored and finish the game.  Except one notorious boss fight, the whole game was an awesome blast of the funs.  Would probably absolutely definitely recommend.",

The open nature of choosing your missions can cause you to meet allies who will help you in later missions... or remember what you did to them the next time you meet, so be cautious; you may even miss a couple of characters entirely depending on where your travels take you!  The game also has an incredible dialog system, where people will come to know you by your actions and expect you to act a certain way - you can prove them right, or throw them off - something that can come to your advantage played carefully. Enemy or ally, both can work to your favor. Also interesting is the ability to choose a background that further affects conversations and gives your extra points in different categories. (choose Rookie first!)  While the gameplay is your standard TPS/RPG hybrid, this game is a must have for anyone that enjoys games with top tier dialog and freedom of character development such as Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines or Fallout: New Vegas.

            "review_text": "***Welcome to Alpha Protocol Recruit!***  Disclaimer: This game is an espionage RPG, NOT a SHOOTER. So your hard-earned split second pixel hunting skills do not matter that much.  When I have noticed this game, at first I was sceptical due to multitude of bad reviews out there but the game itself proved me wrong over and over. Feeling masochistic I decided to set the difficulty to hard and chose Recruit background which essentially starts with no skill at all.   *Your Career As an Agent*  At the initial stages of the game you choose a background and decide about your skills which you shall develop and the amount of different skills provide a good deal of options to you. Whether you want to go in stealthily, guns blazing or with Bond-style techs, you can develop such abilities as the game progresses. Of course when you approach the game you should consider that this game is RPG which means for example when you use an Assault Rifle, investing in some mods to stabilize your weapon and supporting that with some Assault Rifle skills...you will have an easier time. Do not expect shooter style easy aiming. If you are inexperienced at a certain skill do not expect your gaming reflexes to save you. And similarly if you do not invest in Stealth abilities, you will have a hard time remaining unnoticed...but it is not impossible. Everything in this game tries to enhance your preferred gameplay style.  Now as an agent of Alpha Protocol you will be given an initial training and then they will send you to certain missions where everything you do or say will have a future consequence. Now that is where the game shines. Every person and organization within game contains a dossier where you can learn about them which can be to your advantage. A person might like aggressive and intimidating approach while another will try to remain professional or sneaky. In dialogues and actions if you reflect such things, then you get on their good sides. But you do not necessarily need to get on their good sides and sometimes antagonizing people could provide you different benefits on the long run. And let me tell you...you shall face several important decisions throughout the game, some doors will open for you some will close.   The killer side is the amount of memorable characters and lore the game has. Considering this is an Obsidian game, expect really good writing and indepth lore regarding the gameworld/characters whether it is about an arms dealer or a hierarchical corporation which has too many fingers in every pie across the globe along several side factions which you can encounter as allies or enemies depending on your actions.   *So You Want to Be a Hero?*  Unlike other games where you hoard countless gold/money/coin where you will never use...Alpha Protocol provides you several tempting options to spend your ill-gotten or hard-earned money throughout missions. You want some intel on a certain person? Maybe an armor fit for stealth? Perhaps we can interest you in some incendiary grenades? You pay up on Clearinghouse which is the online blackmarket ingame where you can buy/sell several weapons, armor, gadgets, ammunition, weapon/armor mods, intelligence regarding missions and support. For example, if you buy a sniper dead drop at a certain mission it might make your job easier or you can hire a surveillance service to provide you detailed map of an area or maybe one of your allies can provide assistance at a mission for a fee. As you can see aside from material stuff in Clearinghouse you can spend your money on things which will alter your missions for better.  Of course, there are some downsides to the game since we are in 2016 the graphics will seem a bit outdated but that is easier to get past. There are also minigames which are tolerable except hacking which can be extremely confusing at start but requires a bit getting used to abyssmal mouse control during it and good eyes to spot unchanging code segments. But it is recommended to avoid hacking most of the time if you are not patient and invested in technical abilities which makes the process easier and more palatable. Other minigames are fairly straightforward such as lockpicking and disabling alarms, you shall have no major issues with them. And one last issue could be the hard boss battles which requires tactical approach since they have no mercy. But as a recruit I never gave up, no matter Mike is blasted up with grenades, sub-machine gun'd to death or beaten by several sucker-punches from behind! But yeah boss fights can be hard if you are not properly equipped with some lethal means let it be martial, gunpower or gadgets.  Now on my experience there are moments when the game truly shines. On one of the missions I was quite cornered and decided to give up on stealthy-nice guy approach and threw some incendiary grenades to kill 5-6 enemies which then granted me the perk 'Plan B: Kill It With Fire' which literally cracked me up. On another note, if you go in stealth suit to meet certain people they make fun of you whether you will sneak out after the conversation or not. Which reminds me that the game provides perks based on your actions, choices and playstyle. Even watching news can be helpful at times you know.   Also as a final note, Recruit background will have different cutscenes/dialogues/emails then Veteran which is unlocked by finishing the game on Recruit. So there is you NG+ if you are looking to try different things with a more experienced character. But as I initially said Recruit can be hard at start.  *Conclusion*  Alpha Protocol may have its shortcomings here and there, but if you can look past that you shall have great time with one-of-a-kind espionage RPGs. In my opinion this game is better then games such as Deus Ex: HR which while had excellent differing approaches to missions, they did not have emphasis on relation with other characters too much. In Alpha Protocol nothing is ever black and white. So if you are up for some espionage RPG, give Alpha Protocol a try.",

            "review_text": "Don't let the time played fool you-- I've played this game through a ridiculous number of times, and only recently bought the Steam version.  Especially at the asking price this is an underrated little gem. It has its rough edges and (sometimes endearing) glitches here and there, but it's adaptive in terms of both narrative and gameplay style in sometimes astonishing ways that many games claim but few actually deliver with satisfying variety.  Do you want to be Batman, and stealthily tear through foes as the master martial artist with the gadgets and the tranq gun? No problem.  Do you want to be Bourne? Lethally mow foes down in quick shock and awe close combat and pistol chaining? You betcha.  Do you want to just go full on console FPS style heavily armored marine killing machine? No one will stop you. &gt;:|  The three conversation stances, similar to Bioware's conversation system, are meant to evoke the snark of Bond, the ire of Bauer, or the cool head of Bourne; or mix and match them as you please. Fourth conversation options will also open up depending on what you already know about the person, what origin story you pick... or how well they (dis)like you. Not only that, the game's narrative shifts in often notable and surprising ways depending on what you do, in what order, with whom, and how-- two different plays as Agent Thorton can even yield the -player- a different view of the convoluted conspiracy behind the game's story.  This deep, rich story is also one of its downsides-- due to the aforementioned lack of a final polish, some story threads are either vague or missing entirely, and while the otherwise diligent foreshadowing and character dossiers tend to let the player read between the lines rather clearly... the story can be hard to follow -without- going 'waaaaat' and looking deeper.  Overall I love this game; I'll replay it again sometime soon, and then again, and then again probably after that. This last play through, at -least- my eleventh or so, I discovered an entirely different way to kill one of the game's main antagonists. There's good reason this one's a cult classic.",

If you're REALLY considering reading this whole review, let me tell you why  AS A STEALTH GAME First of all, gameplay is mostly stealthy. That is: Hiding, waiting for enemies to have their backs turned, then kill them without being detected. That is pretty cool. But the feel of the rest of the gameplay just didn't do it for me. Combat kind of blows. It's just not FLUID at all and the amount of control feels like I'm prodding a pregnant cow. For everything it can offer, I would rather be playing a Batman Arkham game when said and done. If you're looking for a Stealth game, do not buy this game, go buy Arkham Asylum.   'But...COMBAT?!' Yes, you can customize your character to be more run-and-gun...but it just wasn't polished enough to really make it feasable alternative. Shooting with that silenced pistol was really cool though. Expect to take a long ♥♥♥ time trying to get unreasonably lucky on some hard bosses.   AS AN ESPIONAGE GAME There is hacks, gadgets, electronic sautering, lockpicking... yes. They are nice little minigames to make you feel espionagey. But by the end of the game, you want to stick a lockpick up your ♥♥♥ if ONE more of these just gives you money (money is used to buy better gear...but you really don't NEED better gear). Nothing that is actually mission-changing at ALL. The integration of these into the actual missions were below expectation, but it was a good effort especially as sometimes it would give you some story.   AS AN RPG This is where Alpha Protocal helps to outshine it's not-as-good-as-Batman stealth gameplay. This I went IN not expecting to like the story, but it was actually pretty cool. The protagonist is way more likable than expected. Not the most AMAZING story, but still pretty OK! Like MASS EFFECT, you get to CHOOSE how you want conversations to go. You can indicate the mood throughout the conversation. Very cool. A LOT like Mass Effect, but with it's own little twist! Kind of felt like a cheaper version of it.  You can Romance women you've kept close near the end, but don't expect anything dramatic...could be a horribly animated kiss, then a 'Mission Completed'. Not close to even Bioware romances.  But, the transitions are kind of cheesy, almost immersion breaking to an already semi-bland story. The things/coroprations that are 'mysterious' in the story, are uninteresting, and I really couldn't care less about learning about them.  The story is run on semi-tracks. Kind of like Mass Effect...linear...but you get to choose your linearism to some degree. Emphasis on SOME degree. Little freedom, but what it is is very appreciated. Go to Saudi Arabia base. Then to Taiwan, Rome, Moscow (those 3 in any order). Then final mission. The safehouse feature was very cool, but honestly I couldn't help feeling like implementation of overall RPG elements was an EXTREMELY poor effort.  'What about the SKILLS?!' To put bluntly, choosing your class isn't really important. It's not really a necessary feature even (you choose whatever skills you want anyway)... the skills aren't very diverse and your choice in them don't really change your gameplay in an already linear game. If you choose anything but spy...you're going to have a ♥♥♥♥♥ier time because combat is not feasably enough implemented to go run-and-gunning.  Don't expect Mass Effect skill options/progression...and DEFINITELY don't expect Skyrim status on this. Very basic, not worth getting worked up over.  REPLAYABILITY?? It's OK...but not really unless you have a strong desire to watch this a second time. Like Mass Effect, the story is pretty much the same, but with different outcomes in the middle if you choose a different dialogue option. But it's importance is severely lessened in Alpha Protocal. I have no interest to replay the story again for another 10 years. Like I said above, class/skill variety is way too lacking to expect replaying just for that as well.   CONLCUSION Look at other games like this closely before buying. There are a lot of similarities Alpha Protocal shares with other games, but is absolutely sub-par compared to them. ♥♥♥♥, I'm always optimistic &amp; thumbs up in reviews, but I just CAN'T be with this game. It's just OK. The story was pretty cool, but it is just another game touched by Obsidian. Alpha Protocal = don't worry about it",

Non spoilery example: There is a boss that, depending on how you act, you can kill roughly halfway through the game, right near the end of the game, have another boss kill him near the end of the game, or have him kill another boss for you near the end of the game.  This is the first and only game I have ever played where there truly was no best path through the game. You make choices, and your choices have consequences, but every path you take through the world of international espionage is rewarded in some way, so if you want to be Jason Bourne, cold and professional, you can.

The minigames are frustrating, the action wavers from slick to stuttering, and an untold number of glitches really put a damper on all the great level design and RPG systems at work. I still recommend it for the dialog and the chance to see a branching narrative done right. It also innovates on the guns-and-conversations genre with it's conversation system: as in Mass Effect you select the tone of your response rather than the exact wording, but here you only have a short amount of time to pick your response.

Your play experience depends a lot on what skills you level and what gear you buy; playing as a frontal-assault combat monster is very different from playing a more stealth or gadget-based character. Almost everything you do has an impact on how the game unfolds; which missions you undertake at what time, how you treat characters, and how you deal with various situations, all change how things play out.  The only real negative I can think of, is that I've found that the controls can be a little jerky at some points when using a mouse.

Some of the in-game animations can be painful to watch (I get back pains just thinking about the sneak/crouch animation). It's also known to have its fair share of bugs and glitches.  Having said all that, Alpha Protocol is still a fantastic action-RPG that I absolutely adored. It all starts with the timed dialogue system which offers several choices and forces you to think fast and pay close attention to the characters on-screen. Just about every decision you make can have an impact on the game going forward and cause the story to branch off in noticably different directions. Combined with the ability to tackle levels in various orders (which in turn influences how the story unfolds), you could play the game multiple times and have each playthrough be unique. The amount of freedom you're given over the course of the game is huge and quite refreshing.  The writing and story-telling are also bright spots. The complex story is full of conspiracy, coverups and espionage. The numerous characters you'll encounter along the way are generally interesting and well-written, most of which have lengthy backstories that you might not be able to uncover in a single playthrough. It's the kind of quality work you'd expect from Obsidian.  And while the sneaking mechanics can be janky at times, going the stealth route is still a whole lot of fun. Executing non-lethal take-downs and maneuvering through levels quiety and undetected is a satisfying feeling. Focusing on stealth/pistol gameplay and playing the Sam Fisher role is the preferred way to go and helps improve the gameplay exponentially.  Given its flaws and inconsistencies, Alpha Protocol is (understandably) a game not everyone will enjoy. However, I feel that if you can look past its problems and appreciate the unique aspects of the game, you can really enjoy the product that Obsidian created.

The dialogue system lets you switch between three attitudes: a professional, by the book sort of ponce who wouldn't emote if the angel Gabriel blow off in his face; an aggressive ponce who sounds like he's five seconds away from snarlingly flipping the global crisis onto its front and pounding away at its netherhole with a Franchi SPAS-12; and the suave ponce, who might as well just save time and mace himself every time he opens his ♥♥♥♥ing mouth. Best of all, even if he only ever talked about his favorite breakfast cereal, he'd still sound like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, because the voice actor delivers every line in the level, smug tones of a highbrow film critic archly dismissing the latest superhero blockbuster as he spoons himself another helping of baby seal.  Let's get the good over with quickly. For once, this is a game that claims that 'every action has consequences' and actually means a consequence more significant than a character maybe wearing a different hat. For example, although the hub-based mission system lets you do the operations in any order, during the one I chose to do last an informant mentioned the previous operations I'd completed in conversation. '♥♥♥♥,' I said, 'this game's just showing off now.' So I immediately became an aggressive ponce and slammed his head into a desk. After which, there was more security in my next mission because the informant went crying to his big brother or something.  The RPG action stuff reminded me of Deus Ex - in a good way. It's nice to see a game where your character has to work on their gun skills and can't expect to draw their pistol and immediately hit the on button on a tumble dryer from nine hundred years. And I was also impressed by the lockpicking and hacking minigames, which nicely balance skill and incremental difficulty, and I can't think of a joke for that sentence, so here's a picture of a dog in a hat.  The thing about Deus Ex, though, was that you could arguably specialize completely in combat or stealth or hacking or playing the cello and still beat the game. Even the final encounter had equal parts monsters, security systems, and incomplete string quartets to allow any approach. Alpha Protocol, on the other hand, is happy to let you sink all your points into learning to waltz only to find yourself stuck in an unavoidable freestyle disco competition. I was a stealth/close combat specialist, and there was this particularly obnoxious boss fight that I couldn't sneak out of and whose CQC attacks wrecked my ♥♥♥♥. I had to inexpertly spray at him with an assault rifle I knew as much about as I did a ♥♥♥♥ing nuclear reactor, then whenever he got his knives out let him chase me around the room like Benny ♥♥♥♥ing Hill!  The skills you can upgrade are stealth, hand-to-hand combat, and then four kinds of guns, which I feel makes little sense. Why the ♥♥♥♥ would anyone specialise in shotguns when a shotgun is a situational weapon? What are you gonna do if there's an enemy more than ten feet away, throw your shoes at him?  The dialogue system gives you about one second to pick a conversational attitude that is summed up in one word, and it's often hard to decipher. You might be talking to a sexy lady, for e.g., when suddenly an option comes up reading, say, 'Trousers.' And there's no way of knowing if this means the poncemaster general will change the conversation to the subject of trousers or draw attention to a specific pair of trousers sneaking up behind them or whatever. So you select it out of panic, whereupon El Ponco promptly pulls his trousers down and slaps his bum while mooing like a lost calf, spoiling your reputation with the character somewhat.  Dialogue seems a bit buggy at times, too, which I guess is inevitable with conversation trees as labyrinthine as this. There was a moment when I was gabbing away with another sexy lady when the option came up to initiate a quick knobbing, which went down reasonably well. Then afterwards she started repeating dialogue lines she'd been spouting beforehand. 'Wow,' I thought, 'I literally ♥♥♥♥ed her brain out!'  There are a couple of other bugs here and there, like how the distinction between a wall you can take cover on and the ones with ponce-repellent wallpaper is known only to Mr. Thorton. But none of them got in the way too much, because after a while my stealth skill was so high I could literally turn invisible and run around insta-killing every possible threat with my bare hands. And nothing could pose a challenge after that, short of the invention of some kind of ponce-seeking missile.  All in all, Alpha Protocol is weak and poorly balanced, like a three-legged dog with an eating disorder. But I want to come back to the story for a bit. You know that extremely brief summary I gave about five paragraphs ago? That's literally the extent of the plot I understood. The rest was an incomprehensible miasma of factions, motivations, and betrayals, through which I was just dumbly acting with zero understanding. Towards the end, a line of dialogue got drowned out just before a boss encounter, and I honestly didn't know if I was supposed to be killing or protecting the guy. Maybe this would be helped through repeat playthroughs; oh, Sega, you crafty ♥♥♥♥♥es!'",

Like RPGs of old, combat and dialogue are so separate as to almost comprise different games within the same narrative, but each is gratifying and reasonably well executed.  What distinguishes Alpha Protocol from similar stealth-action-RPGs are the branching choices. It is impossible to anticipate the consequences of your decisions, and even minor dialogue choices can potentially have game-changing ramifications.  The voice acting ranges from fair to excellent, and the graphics, although dated, convey the setting well enough. The soundtrack occasionally becomes repetitive, but its not a deal breaker.  Like all of Obsidian's work, AP remains very rough around the edges. Expect bugs, glitches, and design flaws to creep into your game every hour or two. If you can work through the flaws, there's a gem here that shouldn't be missed.",

Be warned, of course. The game is riddled with severe technical problems; across two PCs and two operating systems, this game has proven more challenging to merely   run   than any other game I've played in the last five years.   However , it is also among the very best. The setting is lacking any particularly fantastical elements, and the characters are arguably not especially memorable, but the intrigue is well presented, and subtly woven.  The game's dialogue system is superb, reminiscent of Mass Effect, but with the addition of a timer, forcing you to make decisions on the spot and stick by them. Characters react to your playstyle, and the choice to play stealthily, non-lethally, or loudly and violently will ultimately impact certain sequences. Don't expect to notice massive consequences for your choices, but repeated playthroughs show an excptional number of subtle, appreciated differences.  Gameplay is ambitiously diverse. Certainly, as a whole, it controls somewhat awkwardly, as the game does not master any of its elements entirely, but it offers many options competently enough. The standard paths are available; stealth, hacking, gunplay, and melee (unarmed, in this case) are all present. Various abilities, unlocked through RPG-like progression, offer a feeling of meaningful specialization, and nicely allow you to focus on a certain skillset.  If you can tolerate its technical failings, Alpha Protocol offers an experience that's difficult to compare to any other recent releases. It was clearly a labor of love, and fans of other Obsidian games probably know what to expect, in terms of its stability.   Highly recommended , if you want to take a risk on something different from the norm.",

            "review_text": "This game frequently gets compared to the famous  Mass Effect  Series. To be honest though, all the two have in common are the graphic engine, the 3rd person view and the fact, that you as a player get to choose the direction of your ingame conversations. Still, the comparison can be made in order to help people decide, if this game might be for them, or not.   While  Mass Effect  is a lot more RPG (especially the first game) as it lets you wander around, talk to npcs and aquire quests,  Alpha Protocol  is a bit more linear in its storytelling, since only the order in which you complete your missions and the order of your missionhubs can be determined by the player.   The missions itself are pretty action-oriented, even though you might want to take a stealthy approach from time to time in order to take out a few enemies without being noticed or to move into a more favorable position for your assault. It is possible to put lots of talent points into being 'stealthy' and playing almost exclusively like this, but it has to be said that the game is by no means a  Splinter Cell  and some direct confrontation especially during the last stages of the game is unavoidable.   Mission locations are quite diversified, while the level design itself is very linear. During your missions you'll receive radio support by your 'handler', who updates you with the latest mission relevant information. In addition, you'll frequently encounter locked doors and password protected computers, which you'll be able to open or hack by beating one of the increasingly difficult mini-games.   The graphics are decent, I especially liked the facial textures of the characters and the depth of field effects. The voice-acting is great, the writing is excellent, as it often offers you funny witty responses in dialogues and also features your expected conspiracy theories and the like.   Another note on the subject of dialogue choices in this game: unlike  Mass Effect , where you get to choose the exact response you want to give and have unlimited time in deciding on which one it is going to be, you can only choose the general tone and direction of your answer in  Alpha Protocol , while at the same time being forced to make this decision within a few seconds. Responses include 'professional', 'threatening', 'suave', 'flirtatious' or a certain subject you want to touch upon. While initially this system felt irritating, once you get used to it, it feels rather dynamic and natural, since there are no pauses during dialogues and you are forced to make decisions on the fly.   Decisions in this game have a real impact on the main plot aswell, as often you'll have to make meaningful choices between making allies or enemies, life and death or something of similar weight. Characters react differently to your approach during conversations, and since the game keeps track of your standing with each character, I often find myself reading up on a character's personal files before talking to them in order to get a better understanding of what said npc might react most positively to.   So what can you expect from this game? Solid, but not spectacular 3rd person shooter gameplay in a spy setting with some stealth elemtents and gadgets, engaging cutscenes and conversations with meaningful decisionmaking wrapped in a rather complex storyline.    Less depth than  Mass Effect , less playtime and less production value - but by no means a bad game. The only thing the game really lacks because of this are the big, breathtaking moments. Nonetheless,  Alpha Protocol  has some pretty memorable scenes (including hook-ups, you perv!) and I am quite satisfied with my first playthrough.   Especially if you like the spy-setting, want something tight and less drawn out and prefer a more action-oriented approach to the genre,  Alpha Protocol  is a must-have.",

After two hours I was fed up with the game, and uninstalled it.  The teammates seemed rather dull and boring, I didnt feel any obligation or interest to listen to the stuff they wanted to tell me, so I just tl;dr´d 75% of the conversations as soon as I noticed that it was going to be a boring dialogue.  The many ways to kill or not kill and move or sneak around the maps are there, but not necessary nor effective. There hasnt been a single scenario where sneaking around the whole map and silently killing enemies would have been as efficient as just going full Rambo-mode on them.  The weapons feel weird.

However when I reloaded the checkpoint in the Bug the Airfield mission, all the enemies in the area disappeared. This bug is helpful for me to explore the area, but it completely ruins the fun of the game. However those issues are not that severe in the later missions.  Also, sometimes you can't climb ladders or get behind the cover unless you adjust your camera position or simply 'try again'. Such problems are quite devastating if you want to go for a stealth approach.  Besides the technical issues, Alpha Protocol is full of dialogues and text if you like narrative elements in a game.  I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend, because the bugs are ruining the gameplay experience. If you are curious about the game, feel free to pick it up.",

            "review_text": "Take a game with a great dialog system, an interesting story, and no morality system but rather meaningful choices and what do you get?  A game I can't recommend. I'm a little shocked at this game, because on the surface it's everything I should want. The game has a very innovative gameplay system, where conversations matter, and the game doesn't rely on a basic morality, but rather what you say and what you do.   On paper, this is an incredible game, and honestly I'd love to love it I just can't.   The problem with this game is essentially, I've tried to play it three times, and I've failed to get involved. The first time I didn't give the game a real try, so we can forget about that.   The second one I played three levels, and I started the game as a 'Recruit' putting my points into weapons skill to try to make weapons better. It didn't so I gave up. About a week after that I heard if you put the points into stealth the game becomes incredibly easy. I tried that, and ran into a third problem.   The first thing to say is this game's dialog choices are incredible. It reminds me of Catherine a little in that EVERY thing you do feels important and matters. The difference from Catherine is instead of a morality system, there's just important dialogs everywhere.  The downside of this for the third playthrough is none of these dialogs are that different or skippable. And there are some long dialogs in this game, and while there's a decision how the player will respond, most of the time, it only gives a 'relationship' point and continues the same dry dialog with minimal acknowledgement. Did I want to sit through 4 hours of hearing the same dialog a second time with no way to skip? I chose no. But it wasn't only that.   The other major problem with this game is the combat. Dear god, that combat is SO bad. I realize Obsidian was trying to make the combat weaker so stealth became a viable option but often I feel the player can't even aim a gun and can only get a solid firing reticule by standing around for solid minutes. It's BAD. Watch a video and you can see why.   I don't understand this design decision because it takes what is actually a really good game, down to the bad game territory. There's a number of games that have figured this out. Metal Gear Solid 5 heavily pushes stealth but when you make a mistake you can go in guns blazing and save your life most of the time, or hide again. But a SINGLE mistake here, and you're either going guns blazing for the rest of the level (poorly) or you're reloading from the last checkpoint which is usually far away.   I can't really complain about the combat enough, because it's one of the core gameplay in the game, and it really ruined my love for the game.   There's one final issue that people have with this game and I agree with it. The game is NOT made for PC. It's a port and I'll accept that most of the time. I get it. However in this game, there's three mini games. A game where you clip and trace paths works great. A game where you lock pick is quite annoying but still can mostly work, especially if you have a gamepad. But the game where you hack just seems almost unplayable on the computer, maybe it's always that bad but it's annoying as hell.   I gave this game a solid try, three solid tries in my opinion. And I could never get far. It's not the worst game in the world, but there's no way I can recommend it as the combat is just painful.  Here's the final thought. Maybe in the future I'll try this game again and get through the entire game and love it. That's possible, but I won't change my recommendation because NO game should take four attempts to get into. No game should make loving it this hard. I might turn around and say 'I love you' to the game one day soon but that will be an abusive love. And that's not ok!",

            "review_text": "An exercise in frustration!!! I REALLY wanted to love this game and bought it when it first came out, because I thought the story was intriguing and there were choices in dialog etc. I love Deus Ex, so when I saw this game I thought yeah this is gonna be a great game with a different story line, different type of character and menu system. I'm a completionist type player, and if you aren't a completionist then this review won't be any use to you.   Let me start with the hacking... the tutorial at the beginning of the game is useless, and it took me several tries over the years to eventually get past it. I'd try and then get annoyed then stop playing, then I picked up the game up again and give it another try, and so on. Use google and read the endless amount of people who hate the hacking as much as I do. One guy says look for the string that doesn't move, which does work! I can get the right string set, however I can't activate the left string EVER even when I find it because for some stupid reason the key that the instructions on the bottom to set it doesn't work. Each string uses a different key to set it the string for left and right.  Now after endless reading on what others have tried to make the hacking simpler, with the string hacks and some even say avoid hacking and move on. Okay I could do that, skip hacking all together. However if you are a completionist type player who's aim is to earn as much exp as possible to develop the character to the max this is going to be an irritating feeling of leaving things undone!  Also if you are a completionist aiming to get the most exp pts per mission/dialog etc the checkpoints are going to be an irritation as well. For instance if you accidentally chose the wrong thing in dialog and lost a reputation point with someone too bad. This happened to me during a dialog and my phone rang and well let's just say the game forces you to be chained to your chair and disregard what goes on in real life. If this doesn't bother you, then no worries.. however I like the feeling of physical freedom. When the dialog gets screwed up because I am addressing something in real life like answering the phone, it's like I'm being punished. To me it's a design flaw in the game, and the devs didn't take any consideration to real life when the game is on. True you could reload a checkpoint, yay you get to do the section all over again.. kinda like punishment. IMO there should not be a checkpoint save systems in this type of game, with dialog choices.  I play with a keyboard and mouse and I read on the forums that this game isn't too friendly with them. Maybe that's my problem with the hacking, who knows? I know the mouse and keyboard work fine with combat movement, and the combat is kinda ABC 123/no brainer.  I bought this game when it first came out over 3 years ago and then tried it again over 3 years later and I am still having issues. I don't want to give it a thumbs down, but I feel I have to as not to confuse people because of the irritating features of the game. The story development I think I would like if I ever was able to play the game long enough to experience it. However I've got a completionist type mentality, in any game I want to explore every area, I want to hone my choices to get the maximum expierience, if I don't then I feel like I'm missing parts of the game and have failed. That's just me, I know there are plenty of people who are satisfied with not doing that. Until I can change who I am, and lower my standards then I'll not be able to play the game to the end so I'm shelving it again.  If you don't think these things will bother you that I mentioned, then great. I do suggest checking the forums on Steam and other sites to get a census of what experiences others had, before you buy. I think the game would have had great potential as a series, irritating design mechanics aside. I guess there's a reason why there was never a follow up game to it, because maybe the hacking, and mach speed dialog chosing peaved too many people off.",

Control is poor with both the controller and keyboard/mouse, though this is partly because of the biggest flaw: gameplay. The gameplay is absolutely atrocious in every aspect. The minigames irritate at first but later become so frustrating that bypass gadgets are a godsend. The gunplay is poor; our 'elite' agent takes seconds to hit a still, unaware target.

The effect of this is that you can never actually get good at any of the puzzles in the game - because as you invest in your character, the puzzles get harder at a much faster rate. Particularly if you are playing the game with a gamepad (which this style of game is well suited to, normally), at level 14 or so you will simply not physically be able to solve some of the puzzles in time.  This wouldn't be a deal-breaker by itself, but combined with how much of the game's content (in the form of intel) is behind these puzzles, and how many of them in a row you have to pass before your next checkpoint, the game eventually becomes a nightmare for anyone who actually wants to experience the content.  Also, there is way too much mandatory combat for a game that let's you invest almost exclusively in stealth.  Also, the writing is like a male adolescent sex fantasy.  There are some interesting bits - the intel system and the dialog system have potential, but they are utterly wasted in a game that becomes unplayable the more you play it in a certain play style.",

            "review_text": "Yes, the game suffers from a big amount of bugs and problems, but it is still an enjoyable spy thriller with one of the best dialog systems you can get in a game so far. You play as Michael Thorton, the latest recruit in the top-secret group known as Alpha Protocol, what he was in the past prior to his recruitment to the group is up to you to decide when you start a new game, he could even be an absolutely fresh off the hook recruit that hasn't had any prior experience in the field which in itself can have benefits even though it is more challenging compared to picking any of the other classes you're allowed to pick. His first assignment is to go to the Middle East to investigate how a terrorist group called the Al-Samad were able to get their hands on a set of experimental missiles made by the defense contractor Halbech that were used to shoot down a commercial airliner and determine if there is a leak within the company or not. What you say and do actually have consequences later in the game, like letting a certain terrorist go in exchange for information will lead to that you learn more at the cost of the agency becoming a bit more distrustful of what you did. You can also be 'friends' with some of your enemies, they might even respect you for perhaps how sneaky you were in a certain area and that they didn't even know that you were in the country until a short time before they meet you face to face. But sometimes it might actually be more to your advantage if someone hates your guts A LOT, because that means they will be more prone to making mistakes and thus giving you a much needed edge over them during battles. All the weapons in the game as well as the armor Thorton can find are moddable, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Silencers for example will make the pistols silent but also a bit weaker while other mods can lessen the recoil of a gun, more accurate and so on and so forth. The same goes for the armor mods, some modifications can make a suit of armor less noisy at the cost of less protection and vice versa. As this is a RPG, you do get to spend skill points on certain abilities and if you spend points on pistols and such, Thorton will become more accurate with them along with having an easier time landing a critical strike on a foe if he aims long enough at one. Also, during the game you can gain perks from doing certain actions, like for example if Thorton is hit several times in melee combat by a foe, he gains a perk that makes him a bit more durable as he basically learns to toughen up for close encounters like that.  All in all, the game is a bit like S.T.A.L.K.E.R when it came out with its huge bugs and problematic features, but at its core its still an enjoyable secret agent RPG shooter.",

Don't expect a Splinter Cell though, the major flaws in my opinion are: - No illumination system (at least, i noticed no difference between creeping in the dark and moving under the spotlights) - No possibility to move unconscious/dead bodies.

So how does the amalgam work together? Not bad actually.  Something novel to Alpha Protocol are the achievements, called perks. Where most games would give you a shiny meaningless badge saying 'good work' after doing something interesting or noteworthy, Alpha Protocol's perks have mechanical effects. As an example, if you take enough beating without dying, you get a perk which talks about how tough you are and then gives you a bonus to your endurance (which lets you take still more of a beating).  It's easier to talk about what went wrong than what went right. What's not so good about Alpha Protocol?  The early and late story feels quite solid, but the story in some areas of the middle of the game has abrupt conclusions.  Your dialog choices must be chosen before a timer expires. It isn't always obvious what some options refer to until the speaker finishes talking, but that's when the timer expires for picking your response!  The mini-games are actually interesting, but the lock picking mini-game is highly dependent upon the sensitivity of your analog triggers and there are no settings to change the sensitivity; I have no idea how it works without a gamepad. There is one way around any mini-game which give all the same rewards, but it requires a consumable item.  The game saves using checkpoints. You can copy a checkpoint save to be loaded later, but you can never save the game yourself. Many of these checkpoints are at extremely awkward or unpredictable occasions, like when you walk into a room with a bunch of baddies and turrets. Loading at those checkpoints can be unbearable. A good number of checkpoints cause events which prevent you from going backwards. As a person who likes to clean up all the baddies before exploring for hidden goodies, the checkpoint system bit me a number of times.  For my own play through, I was accused of killing people that I had not killed. At the end of a particular mission, the statistics noted I killed nobody. However, the incident of me killing these people came up again and again. I'm not sure if it was because I destroyed some turrets or what, but that really broke immersion every time it came up.  As with all games with a large selection of narrative and gameplay decisions, there are a lot of bugs. If you don't mind games with a lot of bugs and you are looking for an interesting blend of Deus Ex, Hitman, and Mass Effect, then this game is definitely worth picking up sometime.",

            "review_text": "Third-Person shooter/Stealth game with heavy RPG elements. The game has a strong narrative focus and enjoyable stealth and gunplay. The complex dialogue trees and smoothly integrated sidequests are the main replay value, as the rookie and veteran builds have their own dialogue options. Character advancement is fluid, and the high-level skills become overkill in many cases (eg: Chain Shot + Brilliance), while others become virtually essential (eg: Stealth and Infiltrator paths). Perks are interesting and well-implemented, and feel rewarding for trying different approaches to missions.  The game is not without flaws, though. Movement and platforming feels restrictive, specially when compared to pure action 3d platformers. Cover also feels rigid, as some walls and objects don't allow you to hide behind or require you to approach at the right angle or distance to activate the option. Gunsights are not pinpoint acccurate, which leads to a certain frustration during fights, as bullets go stray all the time. Stealth is consistent enough, but tends to shift infrequently, making enemies spot you while on their blind sides some times and not reacting to you in front of them at others. The assault riffle only shoots 3-round bursts. It would've been awesome if you could use one-shot and auto-fire modes. But these flaws are not that significative, since the game is not meant to be an action shooter, full-on stealth or 3d platformer, but a narrative RPG where you can take multiple approaches to challenges.  Gameworld design is more linear than comparable games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but is still open enough to allow multiple approaches to the same objectives most of the time. Dialogues are smooth and flow seamlessly, with nice voice acting. The in-mission chat with the controller adds to the experience, and the limited time to choose replies during conversation adds a degree of challenge to 'cutscenes'. Intrigue storyline is interesting and engaging, and changes according to what you did (or didn't) during previous missions, where you've been and who you've met before. Graphics feel a little dated for 2015, but that's a natural byproduct of technological advancement.",

AI is rather buggy but not in the way most stealth games are, they dont randomly see you through walls or across the map, they do however occasionally completely stop their assigned patrol route and just stand still until aggro'd or killed. Enemies will attempt to flank you if you stay in cover too long and throw grenades to force you out of cover.  Bosses for the most part are rather straightforward, but some are overpowered if you do not buy certain intel on them(a certain boss ignores knockback effects and brushes off punches while sprinting at you...)    Visually this game is not impressive, but it's not so out of date that it's glaring. Characters mouth movement feels natural enough that you dont feel the need to focus on it or attempt to ignore it *cough*life is strange*cough*    Combat is fairly balanced around range, headshots and time, though spread on guns is rather frustrating at times, it can be compensated for with various skill points/perks and upgraded weaponry. Melee is rather fun and reasonably strong, but often pointless vs bosses.  If I were to rate this game out of 10?    Graphics 6/10 Fun 7/10 Story 4/10 Gameplay 7/10    Overall: 6/10",

Yes, you can sneak through like Sam Fisher, but you can also take different approaches. Want to roll heavily armored with big guns? No problem. Want to sabotage enemy turrets to shoot theirs owners? Go ahead.  Many games promise to give you the freedom on how to play through, but this one really delivers it's promises. You have a fairly large skill tree, to customize your character, with stealth, different weapons (each weapon with its own skill tree) cmartial arts, technical aptitude, sabotage and toughness. So ewveryone should find something to their likes.  With that as a base, you can follow different paths in each mission, you can even choose in which order to play through the missions, as they are started from you hideout and you have to decide where to go next.  Throughout the game, but mostly in said hideout, you will watch conversations between the protagonist and different characters. For those conversations, you have to choose from for three to four answers to give. This is one of the few games where your choices actually matter. And I don't only talk about 'Spare that guy's life, and he will appear later', each character you talk to, builds up a relationship with you. Either positive or negative. Everyone has their own personality and reacts different to your given answers. That said, your answers to choose from are always either charming, aggressive, or professional. Depending on the class you picked at the beginning (Soldier, Field Agent, Tech Specialist, Freelancer, Recruit or Veteran) you have a fourth choice. That will be for recruits and veterans. Those two don't have any preset talents and have to start from scratch.  Another great thing are the well made boss fights, which are hard and unique. I mean, a boss who consumes cocaine during the fight, to boost his abilities and burst through the room? Disco lights to blind us, and Autograph's song 'Turn Up The Radio' in the background through out the whole fight? Awsome! Probably one of the best boss fights ever made.  After all the hype, a few words on the games down sides. Every single character anmiation looks ridiculous. Their movement reminded me of Toy Story's tin soldiers. Especially the sneak animation is really, really strange. It's a wonder that no one can hear the protagonist.  The second bad thing is a common problem with most video games. The bad voice over. Though, not immersion breaking, you will have to watch bad lip synch here and there.  To summarize the game in short: Intense, variety and freedom.  I'll give this 7 out of 10 points.  Really one you should try.",

Combat mechanics can be slightly dodgy until you are comfortable with them and work towards leveling up. If you enjoy games such as Mass Effect you will be delighted to know that the dialouge and in game conversation cinematics are where the game can really shine. Unlike Mass Effect you need to quickly decide the outcome of your dialouge choices and be on your toes, This can be fairly interesting towards the outcome and destiny of your character. Alpha Protocol is also quite challenging. Overall I am satisfied with the game.",

            "review_text": "Obsidian's made a name for itself over the years for taking on the daunting task of producing sequels to complex, high profile role-playing games. First it was Knights of the Old Republic II, then Neverwinter Nights 2, and soon we'll see what the studio is able to do with Fallout: New VEGAS. With Alpha Protocol, though, we get an entirely NEW GAME. There aren't any preconceived notions: no established fan base, no gameplay systems that need to be preserved. Finally, this is a chance to see what Obsidian can do on its own terms. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait. It's a wobbly, inconsistent game that gets a few things right, but is filled with so many awkward and glitchy bits you get the feeling that it should have spent some more time behind closed doors.  The setting and story are highlights. It's a spy thriller filled with crime bosses, turncoats, global conspiracy and corporate greed, all told within a flashback framework. You are Micheal Thorton, an agent who's forced to go rogue and unravel a sinister plot to shift the tide of global events for nefarious purposes. Set in real-world environments, this isn't the type of setting we often get for role-playing games. Those used to flinging fireballs or swinging broadswords might relish the opportunity to strap on bulletproof body armor and burst fire with an assault rifle for a change. Like other games where CHOICE and consequence play a role in how the story develops, Obsidian's done a good job in Alpha Protocol making it feel like you have POWER over progression. As Thorton takes on missions in locations like Moscow, Taipei, and Rome, he encounters characters that want to partner up, offer helpful information, or greet him with a bullet. By engaging in a Mass Effect-style conversation system, you determine how you want to deal with them: professionally, with a flippant response, or by planting a bullet in their chest.  Opening up these kinds of options strengthens the role-playing aspect of the game, letting you feel as though you're driving the story instead of being led along by the hand. Don't like that machine-gun toting mobster wearing the pink sunglasses? Then get into a shootout with her. Or, if you'd rather, offer up a few flirtatious comments to win her over. Is that one love interest getting annoying? Well, then just prioritize the mission goal over her safety. Arriving at crossroads like these and determining who lives and who dies also has effects later on, netting you statistical bonuses for your relationship status with characters, unlocking new items to buy, and reaping other REWARDS as you correspond over email with those you decided to keep around. It's an exciting system because you have a timer attached to inputting dialogue options so you have to think fast. Your response could be trivial, or it could wipe out a character entirely. It's just too bad the personalities of the supporting cast aren't developed better.  Most characters, even those around for the entire game, are flat stereotypes who rarely act in a way that feels human. Some scream, swear, and double-cross you and some wear gaudy clothes and dye their hair, but that's no substitute for genuine personality and emotion. When one of the most intriguing characters in THE GAME is a pistol-wielding bodyguard who doesn't speak a word and nearly half of the Alpha Protocol experience is spent in conversation, it's not a good sign.",

I don't know if i would have liked this game if i didn't build my guy assassin i put everything into stealth, pistol and a few points in sabotage and strengths i specialized in stealth, pistol and assault rifle which i regret wish i put it in the CQC but o well you cant go back, all of your decisions are almost finale and it kinda sucks if people want to change there ways let em if they don't want to they wont. why add a strict policy if it doesn't improve the game? o well i lived with it and moved on. I felt that the rectile was the worst i have ever seen and the assault rifle the worse i have ever used! and don't think i would have enjoyed the game other than the first class decisions i made. Its still a FUN game ...  I want to make it clear you can run and gun or you can stealth kill.

Rambo boom boom? -YOUR CHOICES REALLY MATTER GAMEPLAY -Reputation system with nearly all important NPC -Big variety of skills -Character Cusomisation -  'TURN UP THE RADIO' :3   -Missions and how they work together -You can buy intel to help you in mission. Map of location, Soldier to help you in fighting, intel on NPC and organisations -AND AGAIN CHOICES REALLY MATTER! -Ending that can be played differently becouse CHOICES REALLY MATTER! - More? i will update as i think of it Cons. -Graphic? i dont mind it but some people will not like it. -Some animations of player look odd. Like that Martial Arts back-atack-not-killing move. - I dont know what can be con in this game.   BUY IT! PLAY IT!    In my opinion its   9/10.   And you know what? I will play it again But i will do different choices See you when i finish! I will update the review then :D",

Best Element - The story is genuinely interesting, with plenty of intriging characters and plot twists. The dialog system forces you to make quick decisions that truely impact the game and make it 'your story'.  Worst Element - Checkpoints are spaced out too much, making you have to replay large sections of the game if you walk through a door before searching an area to make sure you didn't miss something, or if you fail a lockpick or bypass attempt.  Special Mention - Difficulty can really ramp up if you don't level up an offensive skill. Stealth is useless against bosses.",

Maybe get this title on sale, although, at the current $15 price tag I would still say it is worth the play. Currently $3.74 on Summer Sale is a TOTAL STEAL",

Choose a gun type to use, like pistols or rifles, and then spend the rest of your poitns on stealth and the like...and become /BATMAN/ :D  There is nothing more amusing than pulling a Batman and eliminating the entire base's supply of guards without anyone noticing. Good times.  The game even keeps count of your inflicted hospital bills!  Edit: Alright, wow, old review...Heh.  Alright, looking back, I probably need to go replay this.  Alpha Protocol is a bit chunky, and it's got a bug here and there...but, frankly, I basically don't care about that. It's fun, it's got that awesome Spy Feel to it, you can actually play things multiple ways (Stealth, Tech, or Combat, really) (I enjoy stealthing way too much, but you can also just straight up turn yourself into a walking tank if you want), the characters are fun...  In general, I'd say it's well worth 15 bucks. Even better if you can get it on sale.",
