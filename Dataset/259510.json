            "review_text": "This is a unique air hockey inspired game. The gameplay is fun. The characters are amusing. It is apparent there is much replay value to this game. The gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over. The unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes. A couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed. Overall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it.",

            "review_text": "Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.  Long story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.  Some people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a 'Twi'lek' girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).  Also the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p   + Cute design and characters + Addictive and tons of unlockable content + Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior  +/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy  - The concept gets repetitive quickly - No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually) - Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of variety  After playing for 6 or 7 hours I say it's a good game, fun and with a fair amount of content, but it can get old quickly. If, like me, you are a sucker for casual games and achievement hunting, you will sure enjoy it. If you are looking for a more hardcore game, I would advice to avoid this one, specially at full price, as some will consider it to be a bit too much for what it offers; I had it in a bundle though, so I am more than happy with the value. I totally recommed it if you get it on sale and enjoy some good old casual gaming.",

Beyond that though...wow...this is the worst case of mobile F2P grinding garbage I have found on steam. You will absolutely want to find a cheat tool or something to give yourself more currency. This is really shameful. It expects you to beat every character a few hundred times to really fulfill every goal. You'll lose interest completely by the third match with each of them. I paid about $1.21 after selling some cards and using a coupon and I still think it was a bit of a rip off.",

            "review_text": "Yes, it's Shufflepuck Cafe. In 2013.  How MUCH like the original? Well, I keep doing the thing where you'd smash the puck, only to have the baton or whatever it is called get in FRONT of the puck, and then I move backwards to reset - and smash the puck into my own goal. That happened on the original, and it happens here. The 2nd floor has a good remix of the original tune. Now, there are extras - you have to collect parts of your spaceship and thus play a lot of games vs. the characters, rather than just get to Biff via playing various others. Also I haven't seen my favorite, the character who'd get drunk gradually and then you'd beat the crap out of him because he was WASTED. Oh wait, maybe he's on floor 2 - maybe he's the insect that is at the bar there. The little guy with the eyes is named 'Furry' and he is essentially a cat. There are biographies of each type, and quests.  The ONLY problem with the game is there is no Paranoimia cracktro on the front. Felix Schmidt's music on that is brilliant and I kinda wish it was in the game somewhere.  Also, yay this was in the shop so I could buy it. I never saw, or was given the option to purchase, the original, in stores or elsewhere.  Yes, I like this game (:",

            "review_text": "I was never a big fan of this game back in the Amiga days, when it was merely Shufflepuck Cafe. Now the joint has been upgraded to become a Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe. The core gameplay is the same, PC air hockey, and while it is extremely simple to play, it's anything but simple to beat the majority of your opponents.  Now featuring upgradeable pucks and mallets, along with the ability to acquire special shots (so your opponents are no longer the only players with tricks up their sleeve), the game now offers quite a bit more to tweak the core gameplay. There are also more opponents, although the difficulty level ramps up a lot more steeply than it did in it's earlier Amiga incarnation. Acquiring the necessary credz to purchase upgrades isn't limited to just beating your opponent. There are also collectable credz (as well as experience points) on the air hockey table itself, plus there is some kind of alien fruit machine available to try your luck on, in order to win extra credz and experience points.  The Cantina itself features 4 floors, with 3 opponents on each floor. As you earn more credz, you can purchase access to the other floors, where tougher opponents and greater rewards await you. There are also other items for purchase, such as concept art and biographies (in 18 parts) of each of your opponents. Purchasing these all help towards your ultimate goal, acquiring enough parts to repair your spaceship and return home.  This is a strangely addictive little game that is perhaps a bit pretentious in it's execution. It's almost like the developer wants people to think it is more than just air hockey, as if that alone wouldn't be enough to interest people. The bottom line is it IS just air hockey on the PC, but that isn't a bad thing, many of the best video games are due to their simplicity. That said, i only purchased this because i had a coupon for it, bringing the price down to £1.75. I think it is a good and i do recommend it, but only if you get one of these coupons or if the game goes on sale. At £2 it's great value for money, but at the full £6.99 price i don't think i would be recommending as much.",

            "review_text": "Linux: set up by enabling /dev/input/event* to have read permission for the mouse to work. Otherwise had zero issues as a Linux user.  I love these kinds of games, and this one delivered:  The main thing here is the controls/gameplay are more fun than you would expect. I mainly bought this game because of nostalgia from an old tablet game, but am already having a lot more fun than expected with a mouse. There's enough variety in the gameplay that other similar games I've played seem a bit 'flat' in comparison.  The second thing is how fast it gets you into the action. There's a tutorial, but it's skippable. The story stuff can barely bring down the pace, but does a great job of adding incentive to keep playing. Ignoring all that, the game launches quickly and there's barely any clicks before you're quickly setting up a game. It's a smooth and extremely well presented/executed process imo.  The personal nitpicks I have against are minor and rarely get in the way of playing. It being a bit unclear of the 'best' way to earn rewards. If/how neutral power-ups impact the AI. Stuff like I can't find a volume control (only music/sound on/off) and the default is probably loud because of that. For the last one, I'm catching up on my own music collection in the background anyway, so adjusted that to the sound effects volume.  Overall, Shufflepuck is a nice balance between getting you into the action and providing enough presentation/gameplay variety to keep you interested in one more match. If you've enjoyed an Air Hockey type game before, digital or physical, this is worth picking up.",

            "review_text": "Fills me with nostalgia for my youth playing the black and white Shufflepuck Cafe on an old Macintosh. The characters are interesting and colorful, as is the setting. Graphics wise it comes into its own while still appealing to the old aesthetics.   It is fun and challenging learning how to anticipate and overcome new opponents techniques. First playing the opponents on the disco floor and being a bit overwhelmed, but managing to get up to speed with them and finally consistantly winning is pretty satisfying.    However, being a gripey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I have a few relatively minor criticisms:   -The missions get a bit monotonous, as does some of the character animations. A few of the animations when you win a point over an opponent actually were making me a bit nauseous, as the camera jolted repetitively.   -There are a few game-destroying bugs at the time of me writing this, like the shock-absorber puck you're forced to use with some missions will get stuck to the side of the table and move extremely slowly such that it will take over a minute for it to reach the opponent.   -The ability of opponents to block the puck seems random at times, as some of your seemingly most skillful shots will be easily stopped, while some sluggish accidental returns will make it through. The physics also seemed to be a bit off sometimes, as when the puck ricochets at a strange angle, but it's not enough to take away from the fun.",

Porting from such devices is normally done quite well but this one has lost some of it polish, especially when it comes down to the interface speed. If you don't own a tablet version, than you have nothing to worry about :)  The gameplay has remain the same, and playing with the mouse is far far better than your fingers. As you don't have to hold a device, you really can focus on playing the game, which is downright fun. Learning the moves of your opponent is quickly done and than it's off to your own skill to defeat them. The learning curve is gentle and you're quick into the game. You have 19 different opponents to beat which scale up nicely. Your skill should too so after a while to really notice you can actually beat that dude that smacked you in the ♥♥♥ a few hours earlier.  Nice about the game is that it rewards you a lot. Either with coins, experience points or achievements, it all adds up to that 'just want to play one more game' feeling.  Music and sounds are ok, only thing is that the music from the Hall keeps hangin' on hours after you stopped playing. 1920's music isn't that great but this tune keeps coming back...   Overall the game is fun to play and keeps you interested for a while until your skill doesn't increase any more or you just get bored.",
