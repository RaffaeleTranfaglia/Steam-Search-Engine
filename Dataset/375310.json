            "review_text": " This is a Puzzle spin-off, not a plataformer like the main games of the series    Hose it Down!  is a great and simple puzzle game, with just as much personality as the main games have. While the game may feel short at first, since it took me about 2 hours to complete the base 25 stages under the time limit for each 'Star', I was surprised by another 25 EX stages. At that moment I knew I had to tell the world about this game.  The challenge is there for those who want it, with the previously mentioned 'Stars' in each level, in case you complete them under a certain time. If you just play casually you can still have fun, but the thrill of shaving off each second from your previous best time while trying to get each 'Star' is a superb feeling.  The music is great in my opinion, it certainly made me feel pumped even while facing hard stages and I caught myself humming some stage themes a few times.  I do have one complaint, and it is the control. This is a port of a mobile game, and it shows. Dragging the blocks around can be a little iffy at times, and you must make horizontal or vertical moves only, if you by mistake try to move a block in a diagonal (even if you have space for it), you may end up not moving the block at all. This can be an issue while trying for better times, leading to frustration.  And I haven't found a 'gallery' option in the game to check the cool pictures you get after each completed set of stages. Bummer.  Even with the controls being a little annoying at times, I still recommend the game for its price. It's a great pass time and challenging too.",

Hose it Down!  is a fun little puzzle game.  pros: &gt; Cheap &gt; Easy to play &gt; Good when need to kill some time or take a break from your main game. &gt; Sounds and music are decent. &gt; Graphics are 2D but smooth  Cons: &gt; Could be considered repetitive  Overall a fun little game to kill some time and its short to complete took me about 3 hours (not in one sitting) so it doesnt get boring.  if its on sale worth picking up 5/10",

            "review_text": "Hard to figure out controls at the beginning since there are neither config. menus nor help sections. Quite easy to grasp anyways.  Simple mechanics which lead to cunning solutions over time, so the game is fun to play and reasonably addictive.  As usual with wayforward, the music is fine and the GFX are cute. So, overall, it's a nice deal for 1.5$. Seemed like a cute little game, turns out as a good suprise.",
