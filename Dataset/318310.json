The only thing I don't like is that it is all white. I wish there was some color or design to the background to make it a little more intersting. Looking at a mostly white screen for a long time can be hard on the eyes. Other than that I think this game is great.",

Play as a hard-nosed must-win lawnmower, a what-the-hell blow-it-to-the-wind maverick, a goodie-two-shoes save-everyone hero, or something in between.   Demons, intrigue, dark magic, lawyers.   This story is really worth the small amount of cash that it costs.",

I strongly suggest that anyone who enjoys a good read or a good story invest in this. It's pleasant to the eyes/mind, and a stimulating read. Or it was for me, at least. Entertaining and amazing.",

And this game and its sequal are THE best choice of games that have come out hands down. You are doing yourself a disservice if you dont read it.  Gushing aside the one problem I do have with it is I wish it would go into more detail for entry level readers. This game doesnt pull it punches regarding its lore and though a significant portion of the imagery itself is left to the readers imagination, I feel it could have been better with a smidge more detail regarding the laws (or lack thereof) that goevern this universe which the books do a better job at doing than this game does.  My low playtime is because I have it on my phone as well and did the majority f my playing on that device. The same is true for a quite a few other Choice of games actuall.",

I would add that instead of hitting those pages where you didn't read the author's mind and get that 'you died' page after page after page, it allows you to keep playing even if you made a bad turn, and sometimes it turns out okay anyway.  The achievements are simple, but i found myself checking in to see what else I could get. I finished the entire game in a single playthrough, and I'm thinking I might keep at it until I see where all the different threads lead.  I'd recommend it!",

I just finished my first playthrough, and I expect to play through at least one or two more times. The content is great. It really is a choose your own adventure style game, only the adventure involves being a necromancer/lawyer (Necrolawyer?). It's a lot of fun, and it is definitely the kind of game that you can play for only minutes at a time, or for hours. It's also nice to be able to listen to music while playing.   Final thought: If you like reading, and you like video games with stats and character customization, buy this game. I will be getting their other works soon.  Cheers.",

But the on to the game itself. I don't want to spoil anything but choices matter and affects the story, I played through it several times just to see all the 'What if's'.  Its a great game, well written, good characters and funny. I recommend it warmly.",

I was drawn in by the enticing description and I must say this game really surprised me to the point of getting me to start reading the books I had in my backlog for years now! It's the kind of short but sweet game that you can't stop playing once you start it, thanks to the excellent writing. I'm only sad I didn't get to experience even more situations with the characters, I hope the devs make more stuff like this soon.",

It's rare for a writer's description to be both detailed and abstract yet that somehow fits this style of writing. By far one of the best games published by Choice of Games at the time of this review.",
