My parents got this for me when I was a kid and I never finished it until now because the disk no longer runs on my computer.  I enojyed the story and enjoyed the puzzles, although some of them required a bit of back and forth. I would recommend this game, despite its lack of replayability.",

I feel as though these games are not recognized well enough in the gaming community. This title does not deliver, in terms of fear, as much as some of the other entries, however, I still am tense and on the edge of my seat through out. The ending delivers just like every Nancy Drew game does. I strongly recommend this game.",
