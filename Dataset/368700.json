    "description": "Mysterious Space was originally created for the 2014 7-Day Rogue-Like competition, but has received many updates since! It features many familiar rogue-like elements - including potions, equipment, and procedurally-generated worlds - but is ultimately a side-scrolling action shooter.",

            "review_text": "This is a fun little action-roguelike. It's great for a quick run, but also has that addictive 'one more try' factor. There's good variety in the environments and random loot. Seems well balanced. The music is great, but a few more tracks would be nice. A controller is definitely the best way to play this. Thumbs up!",

        {
            "review_text": "This is a very fun roguelite/like/whatever. Your basic loop is to visit the planet, pick up the fuel and get out. It has a Defender vibe since you're going horizontally. Each level is randomly generated with plenty of challenge that ratchets up the longer you're flying around. In the Rougue-ish tradition, there are mysterious pickups that can be good or bad with buffs, debuffs and upgrades following their identification. This isn't a flashy looking thing but I just imagined the geometric shapes were Bill Cipher and it made it even more fun. Swell soundtrack too.",
