            "review_text": "For what it is, its fun. I think that adding more modes like co-op could make this crazy fun!, maybe adding a rouge like mode where if you die, your save gets deleted would be awesome too. I also think that the levels should have a bigger area because you have to constantly move backwards, but if the levels were bigger, you'll have more room to move.  There are towers in the game that spawn loads of enemies and as you kill the enemies, the tower decreases in size. I think this would act as the perfect oppitunity for boss fights.  I think adding something like the nemesis system into this would be great, I also think that adding lines of dialouge to the orcs would give them more of a personality and would make them feel like living beings and not just unimportant swarms of enemies. Some of the enemies seem really repetitive and when they spawn, they spawn from a purple portal, I think getting some of them to come out of buildings to fight will be a nice touch.  I love the key bindings, but the options menu is a bit lackluster. The gui is okay, but at the beginnig there is no tutorial, yo you have to find out how to switch weapons yourself.  On the topic of AI, i think adding a companion would make things alot more fun, maybe a pet or a ranged companion would be cool.  Also some weapon customisation would be really cool and maybe some merchant stores and stands would be a cool addition. The pickup system works well, but if you earn money by killing enemies, it would make upgrading weapons and buying potions that much better.  I'm recommending this because I trust the developers on improving some aspects and the game at its current state shows that the developers want to make a good game but its really lackluster at the moment.",
