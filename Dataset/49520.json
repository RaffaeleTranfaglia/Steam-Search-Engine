            "review_text": "There is something to be said for a game that I just don't get sick of. I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there. Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well. So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character. Dar  I'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now. I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to 'prestige' it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM. xD  I feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time. Do a few things, and then quit playing. Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that. I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up.   I play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER. People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game. It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo. Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it. They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo. The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies. Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power. Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs. damage defense.   Borderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion. The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts. I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it. I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers. Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon. After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!  Buy the GOTY Edition. It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want. Forget about the Season Pass and regular game. GOTY has all that stuff and more. Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round. The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices. Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs. Unless you like that sort of thing. Wait for it to go 75% off and you can get GOTY, UVH Pack, and allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20. BTW...these DLCs are legit and worth buying. This isn't some garbage map pack DLC, or jsut skins. These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCs, and add even more than that in some of tehm. GOTY edition has almost too much content. &gt;_&gt;",

            "review_text": "Borderlands is an FPS+RPG game that includes tons of shooting and looting fun.  Probably one of my favorite games of all time, I've had so much fun both in singleplayer and with other friends. The game has lots and lots of dlcs for you to enjoy, not to mention all the different guns this game has. It has such a massive variation , almost every gun spawn with random parts from each manufacturer which makes it even more interesting. The art style is cartoon-ish which i think is absolutely great makes it really cool to play.   The game has alot of replay value since they give you already 4 characters with their own uniqe skills to play around with plus the two dlc characters. The game is fairly long and there is still alot of stuff to do if you actualy complete it. The world is completely open and there is alot of exploring to do in the game. I've spent up to many hours getting just one gun that i wanted, but when you finally get the gun you have been farming or hunting for you really feel that you have achieved something.   I made alot of friends in the past playing this game, either i joined random games or i found someone through the community, we had tons of fun together and we always kept on playing it every day. The coop has space for up to 4 players which i think is just fine considering the balancing of enemies (The more players you harder the game becomes, the better loot you will get.) That's really all i have to say about this wonderful game, I give it 10/10 probably the best game I've ever played, recommended to the highest.",

            "review_text": "This review has been updated for the Nominee   First let me explain why I wrote this title 'Stairs? Noooooooooooooooo!' This is a funny dialog in the last chapter in Borderlands 2 where you team up with Claptrap to defeat Jack. After eliminating tons of robots and Claptrap manages to access the door, stairs are just right before Claptrap. He's not able to climb stairs as he has no feet but wheels. If you're careful enough, you will understand this right away which has been mentioned in the beginning of the game. Hence I personally prefer this as the most noticeable symbol for Borderlands and especially, for the Claptrap, who is designed to be your reliable and adorable company during the entire game-play.   As for the game itself. Borderlands 2 would stand for the the peak of the series, since the pre-sequel is widely considered as a DLC instead of a new game. Borderlands 2 brings more playable and discoverable elements compared to the origin Borderlands. More variable weapons, characters, games within the game and remarkable scripts. In Borderlands 2, you will find the deep insights of the background, where the Vault Hunters from, their own stories, how the Pandora it works. And most importantly, you're gonna save the people.    Yes the review is personal and quite personal, but It deserves the awards I personally nominated to and I share it with the community. It's my 'Borderlands' and there must your Borderlands somewhere. Thanks for your time on this.",

            "review_text": "Bout time I reviewed this game. This review is coming from over 2000 hours of game time (Steam and xbox combined) so i know the ins and outs of nearly every part of the game.  To start with, its a great solid game in which will provide plenty of entertainment for you and friends, solo or in a full team of 4. Yes the game is a blast solo, though alot is said about its co-op experience however that doesn't mean it isn't fun for single players, but obviously you can get more (or less in terms of loot) from playing with friends. This game is addicting, you just want more and better loot and to level up, kill the raid to get loot to kill the raid again, run arenas, play slots, chest farm, boss farm, toilet farm... well those aren't that lucrative. The fast paced gameplay and tense combat is great fun and when you get through without dying or going down you get a real sense of achievment, or relief if you did happen to do down or die. A first playthrough is always a blast and that alone is worth its cost, then if you REALLY enjoyed yourself you get to do it at a higher level, with more challenge, but more reward.   This game for me is about gameplay, not the story telling, yeah there is a stronger story than BL1 and more narrated side missions it still isn't up there with the likes of halo, GoW or other top, story focused games. So don't go in expecting to have a brilliant campaign story, go in expecting to have fun, and to have a good laugh.  There are plenty styles of play that Borderlands supports. Like being the center of attention, taking fire, tank it all and kicking out lots of dps at close range? Gunzerker. Like sitting back and sniping? Zer0, who isn't affraid to go ninja and stab enemies in the back. There is the siren, a support character for that team player. Then there's Axton, well, axton is a tricky one, tough to play at the top levels however early game, he shines with his huge tank, area of effect (the nuclear kind) and crowd control. then there are two bonus to provide lots more hours of fun after you get bored of the other four.  Yeah the game has its downs, its buggy, the scaling of certain skills, mechanics such as damage over time and certain types weapons just lose out to level. At top end level the game almost becomes unfair to the player forcing them to use only the best gear in the game, specific builds and so on, but then again, it is the top level. Its easy to break certain parts of missions forcing you to reload your game which can be very fustrating, also the AI has some weird quirks but overall isn't too game breaking.  Overall this is a game I would recommend even now just before the pre sequel as this is a game that will never grow old, will allways be fun to pick up and play, yes it has some flaws but to a flawless game is nearly impossible and well this is a game that triggered the looter shooter genre and so it must be good!",

            "review_text": "9! 24! 58! 100! 500! 1000! Critical! Is there a better visual barometer for satisfaction in videogames than damage numbers popping out of an enemy’s bullet-riddled head? The original Borderlands revelled in this instant gratification, complementing this core conceit with a ‘bazillion’ guns, tight shooting, addictive loot and a droll sense of humour. There’s little wonder why it was such a surprise hit back in 2009, and just as unsurprising that we’re back on the bombastic world of Pandora for Borderlands 2; a sequel that once again basks in the glow of numbers and bullets, hidden treasures and boner jokes.  Set five years after the events of the first game, Borderlands 2 features an entirely new cast of playable vault hunters. After the original group opened the fabled vault and dealt with what was hidden therein, an arrogant prick by the name of Handsome Jack took credit for their actions, declared himself the dictator of Pandora, and is now attempting to plunder the planet of its most valuable resources, hoping to awaken some sort of ancient alien power. You’ll team up with a resistance movement led by the original cast of vault hunters, intent on stopping him and looting the entire planet along the way.  Those same original vault hunters also now have dialogue, fleshing them out as actual characters after their previous stint as mostly silent protagonists. Borderlands 2 presumes you have some sort of reverence for the original cast despite their previous silence, but their inclusion and subsequent portrayals pay off in some interesting ways, both in regards to the narrative and the game’s humour. Most of the dialogue is fairly sharp across the board and its multitude of zany characters, new and old. The first game’s wacky sense of humour remains, with continuous pop culture references and a ludicrous amount of hidden Easter eggs, and this carries into some of the quest design and its inherent physical comedy.  The humour’s in-your-face nature can be a little much at times, especially when jokes miss or drag on for far too long, but the near constant stream of dialogue keeps Pandora feeling alive, especially in the once-lonely single player. It can be immature at times, relying on cheap gags to generate a chuckle, but there’s also a lot of humorous dialogue that will consistently muster more than a laugh or two, and the majority of its voice acting sells each character with aplomb, delivering some fantastic performances.  The most substantial improvements come in the gameplay and how you’re able to spec your character. In the first game you could pick the Soldier class, for instance, and by the end of the game you were essentially invincible if you spec’d in the right directions. Your deployable turret could not only lay waste to everything in sight but could also regenerate health and ammunition, leaving you free to stand still and eradicate an entire group of enemies with relative ease. Borderlands 2 has been reworked and is much more balanced, giving each character class a specific playstyle that comes with their action skill and making sure to never overpower them to tedium.   There are three skill paths to choose from, each one focusing on specific areas, whether it’s improving your action skill, allowing you to do higher damage with certain weapon types, increasing your maximum health and so on. The Assassin, for example, is very similar to the Hunter class from the first game, focusing on sniper rifles and improving their effectiveness. But each class plays much differently in Borderlands 2, so the Assassin’s action skill is comparable to the Siren’s previous phasewalk ability, allowing him to turn invisible for a brief amount of time where he can utilise his melee attacks; something the Berserker class focused on in the first game.   The gun manufacturers now produce particular kinds of weapons with their own distinct visual characteristics. One such manufacturer is Jakobs, who build Wild West style guns so you’ll find lots of revolvers and rifles that can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger but reload very slowly. Maliwan, on the other hand, builds weapons that deal out elemental damage, so they’re your go to guys if you want to set someone on fire.  Whichever concoction of assorted weaponry you choose, Borderlands 2’s gunplay is tight and intuitive. Whether it’s popping the heads off bandits, melting a robot down with corrosive ammunition or hitting a Skag with the butt of your rifle, the combat remains entertaining long past your first playthrough and into new game+. This is thanks in no small part to improvements made to enemy AI.   In Borderlands 2, enemies now move with more purpose and dexterity, keeping you on your toes and forcing you to adjust your aim as they dodge and roll, duck and weave. It’s not a massive enhancement in artificial intelligence, but it’s an improvement that gives the combat a more frenetic pace. Suicidal psychos will often charge you, explosives at the ready, while various projectiles are thrown in your direction. You’re constantly dashing from place to place and there’s a fantastic freedom of movement.   There’s a phenomenal agglomeration of enemies, each befitting of some sublime character design and enjoyable AI. You’ll face off against cloaked monsters, robots that can transform into makeshift tanks and a gargantuan bandit that bursts into a fit of rage, killing friend and foe alike. Each enemy requires a different tactic to beat, whether it’s utilising your action skill, equipping a weapon with a particular type of elemental damage or inciting enemy v enemy combat.  The game looks sublime on PC as well, particularly if you can run it on close to the highest settings. The cel-shaded art style never fails to shine and there’s some outstanding lighting effects that complement the level design. This is still the same Pandora as the first game but it’s been injected with a burst of colour and environmental variety. The desert wasteland still remains but now there are plains of green grass, snow swept icy caverns and a deep underground mine coated in luminous green acid. The colour pops with the art style like a comic book; Pandora’s exalted sense of place and character still remains.  Borderlands 2 successfully maintains every aspect that made the first game such a surprise hit and improves upon them in all the ways that matter. The majority of these improvements may only be incremental which gives the impression Gearbox took the safe route, avoiding major iteration, but the formula still works. Whether that formula still appeals to you is the real question. If you’ve already spent countless hours with the first game is more Borderlands something you want? If it is then Borderlands 2 is a better game than its predecessor in every way. Just only by a smidgen.",

Pandora is a very violent war-torn planet where no one in their right mind would visit, except for the insane... being bandits, local inhabitants who can't get off world, and vault hunters.    -Detailed breakdown review-   Story: You're a vault hunter, you've been lured onto Pandora in attempts to find the mystical place known as “the vault”, in the vault you gain unimaginable treasure... should you succeed in finding the vault; there's no telling what wonders you will encounter. But wait, before you run off and try to open the vault yourself, there are many enemies who wish to claim the vault as their own prize! Not to mention monstrous beasts that protect the vault. You don't even know where to go! To find the vault you will need friends, cue “Handsome Jack”...  ...okay, okay, by now most people actually know how this story goes, the Story telling in Borderlands2 is excellent, a nice blend of cinematic, voiced dialogue.   Game Play:  Borderlands2 is played in the first person view, initially there are only four playable characters/classes (with mods you gain 2 more), you have different types of weapons, elements, many different types of NPC's to fight, 3 skill tree's for each class.  The playable characters/classes are: Axton (Commando), Maya (Siren), Salvador (Gunzerker), Zero (Assassin), and with purchasing the appropriate DLC you gain access to Gaige (Mechromancer), and Krieg (Psycho). If you want to know more about a specific character/class I would recommend checking out online guides.  It's important to note that there are about 6 different classifications of weapons (Assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shot guns, 'ya know – the normal gun you expect) it's even more important to note that each character/class can use any weapon... however some characters are better at certain weapons because of skill builds. (meaning, Zer0 (the sniper/assassin) is better with sniper rifles, but you can pick one up with Salvador (gunzerker) and use it, but you probably won't be as accurate as Zer0 is.  In addition to various weapons, are there many different special perks a gun can randomly roll, including different elements (Incendiary, Corrosive, Shock, and Explosive) which are more effective against different types of enemies. The point is, that the same gun can drop twice and have completely different stats.    Achievements:  Borderlands2 has 69 achievements in total, 50 achievements are available on the core game, the 19 other achievements are spread out across 4 DLC items you'll need to purchase to get 100%. All of the achievements are very obtainable, however, some require some grinding and luck (like, Challenge Accepted, Tribute to a vault hunter, and a number of other circumstantial achievements) Lastly, there is at least one achievement per class, the rest can be obtained with one character.    Price:  Borderlands2 is priced at $19.99 The game of the Year edition is priced at $39.99. I personally suggest purchasing the game of the year edition so you can get the DLC for the whole game. With the release of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel the chances of picking up a copy of Borderlands2 on sale is dramatically increased, so it's worth noting that you could wait for a 75% off sale.   Conclusion:  Borderlands2 is hilarious, fun, has morbid-humor, insane people, guns, guns and more guns! I have little to nothing negative that I can say about the game. The graphics for the game itself are more cartoon-styled in nature, increasing the life of the game (It won't take back seat to high end graphic games as fast, because they're trying to replicate realism, they're implementing their own style and art). All in all, I loved playing Borderlands2, I played the heck out of the game, it's more fun to play it with a friend, but it's one of those games you can spend a lot of time playing just to blow up bandits. I recommend this game for FPS gamers, and people who enjoy Adventure/Action games.  ------Edits and updates------ Edit/Update June 09, 2015: Here's the URL to see my review for  Borderlands  Here's the URL to see my review for  Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is DLC   Edit/Update June 09, 2015: Here's the URL to see my review for   Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt  Here's the URL to see my review for   Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage ",

I'm just kidding about Claptrap. He is as funny as he is annoying (most of the time).  I had the retail release of BL2 (and none of the mission packs and Vault Hunter upgrades at that time) way before I even became a Steam member. It's still as much fun now as it was back then. The DLCs add fresh content plus a good dose of hilarity, especially the Mechromancer and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep!  In terms of play and narrative, this is a very simple game at its core, but it's incredibly fun because it does it what it does with great polish, and the presentation is top-notch.",

            "review_text": "(Just humour me for a moment and pretend like you've somehow never heard of this game before) Hey, JacquesLeSauve, what's this Borderlands 2 game I keep hearing about?! Well, mister and/or miss random person gamer, since you ask!...   Borderlands 2 is a first-person, co-op, loot-hunting shooter with RPG elements, and, it might surprise you to know, the sequel to Borderlands 1! (and technically the Pre-squeal, but that's kind of a grey area) Play through a lengthy campaign as one of four characters, each with their own unique abilities and upgradable skill trees to compliment those abilities. Complete quests, fight badasses, earn money, level up and explore the strange and wonderful world of Pandora, all the while searching for that hot new gun that's gonna seriously f*ck sh*t up and ruin everyone else's day. Sweet.   The perfect antidote to an endless array of grey and brown shooters, this vibrant, cel-shaded style game refuses to take any part of itself seriously, save for the gameplay. Brimming with personality, it never misses a chance to hit the player with an off-colour joke or make fun of either itself or gaming in general, with a large portion of that magic being owed to the brilliant writing. The vast majority of characters fit into their roles perfectly and are expertly voiced as well, which is a huge breath of fresh air given how lacklustre the writing and acting can be in so many other games that have yet to learn how to feel natural or not completely chew up the scenery. OK, maybe the main villain is guilty of that heavy-handedness as he's so manifestly evil he goes beyond caricature or archetype and smacks of the creators trying way too hard to rile the player up and make them hate him. But even then he rarely outstays his welcome for too long.   Gunplay is pretty much rock solid as everything feels like it behaves exactly the way it's supposed to, whether it's firing something big and heavy and primitive that makes a big boom, or something more elegant and finely balanced for those scalpel-like precision kills. Even reloading a weapon can feel immensely satisfying, between the reload animation itself or the nice, big clunking sounds of a clip being jammed into place... a sentence I never thought I'd hear myself say. Now I feel weird, like a freaky gun fetishist. Eurgh. But yeah, for a game all about shooting, this nails it for sure... even though I'm the type of player that likes to bring a knife to a gun fight. But either way, whatever you're into, this game has you covered.   Speaking of having you covered, I really have to mention the online community. I'm not much one for online play typically, be it co-operatively or competitively, so not being massively familiar with it, I was a little apprehensive going into this, especially hearing horror stories about a few other communities, so I was expecting the worst. But I was really pleasantly surprised at just how nice and friendly and (mostly) competent the majority of other players seem to be. Sure, you'll occasionally get the odd palindromic loot tool come along and grab all the best gear for themselves, ignore other players in need, then talk cr*p about everyone else when no-one comes to their rescue. But in my experience most players here are incredibly nice and considerate and generous (I especially love the 'loot fairies', players that randomly dropped into my game, threw a load of gear at my feet, then disappeared, never to be seen again) and many will happily chat with you if that's what you're into. I've even added some good people to my friends list off the back of this game. So if anybody's worried about that aspect of the game, they really needn't.   If I had to make one major complaint about this it would be the opening. The bleak tundra setting of the first few hours really isn't very inviting or stimulating to the player and feels more like it should have been a mid to late game location rather than your introduction to the world, even for seasoned veterans of the first game. And, unfortunately, this is probably pretty unavoidable, given the nature of games where you have to level up, but you won't get any interesting gear for a while, either, and everything might initially feel really mundane for some players. But if you can push through it, then once you acquire newer, more interesting abilities and perks and expand your arsenal to include more exotic and outrageous gear, than that's when the game really starts to shine.   So, with tons of replay value, between the multiple characters, two new game + modes and tons of additional DLC to purchase, whether you play this alone or with others, this is a game that should keep you busy and happy for a long, long time. So good is it, in fact, that after over 300 hours of play I'm still not tired of it and can't wait to see what they'll do for the third outing. Come get you one!",

            "review_text": "So, a few years after the FIRST Borderlands came out, I developed a deep hatred for it. I though it looked stupid. I still haven't played the first one to this day (I missed the sale), but I grabbed this mainly because a friend said we could play together (we have not since).  But hey, part of what makes me LOVE this game so much is because SO many people still actively play it. I swear, every time I've started playing, and sometime during the session, one of my friends asks if they can join my game and/or I can join theirs. Some people don't intend on making me feel like a noob—though they do and I'm okay with it/don't say anything—but it's so fun! The game has the most unique online systems I've ever seen IN a video game, and everyone just has a ton of fun~  The game itself is very similar to Bioshock (thanks 2K) in the means of shooting, crazy-♥♥♥ weapons (MUCH more so here) and looting. A LOT of looting. You could spend hours in the game literally making little progress, but looting EVERY container you can find, and there are plenty of secrets to find, too! I'm sure those secrets go with a few achievments, but again, if you don't want to spend hours...they're just achievemnts, dude; I know it's hard to resist, but it really can get tiring looting everything.  The game's got a LOT of humor, and a LOT of unique storyteling/characters that help with that. It's an experience EVERYONE deserves to enjoy. And I feel bad I looked at this franchise the wrong way at first.",

All the weapons have such a wide variablity that you can always find the best weapons that suit you fo the time being.  The only thing I have bad against this game, is the time it can take to level, sometimes I would play for a long time and not get a level (this is like after level 40) and it can just get tedious with the amount of time.

I, however, have never played the original Borderlands, and was impressed that the developers could create a game with the perfect balance of cartoon comedy and overall game intensity. This game is undoubtedly the pinnacle of action comedy games to date. The game is extremely easy to run (even on a single core processor in my case), and although it maintains a cartoon appearance, it is still quite beautiful at times. However, it wouldn't be fair to leave out the limited number of downfalls that hold this game back from perfection. It's limited customization is disappointing, although this can be made slightly better with DLC. I also experience a crash about every 5 hours of gameplay, which can be annoying when progress is lost and areas must be cleared again. I have also experienced getting stuck a couple times, and once again, I was forced to sacrifice my progress.

Each class plays differently and with the talent tree choices even playing the same class over can feel slightly different. The length of the main story campaign feels decently long but can be rushed through relatively quickly. That's why I highly suggest playing through all of the available side quests and EXPLORE.

I couldn't believe my eyes.  It is now maybe 3 years later, that I have gotten myself into Borderlands 2 (which, guess what - was gifted to me!) with two other friends. I am absolutely in love.

Of course, there is also DLC you can purchase to further customize your character -- but you do not even have to. You can also unlock OTHER character customizations just by playing.  Loads of fun. Quests can sometimes be confusing on figuring out exactly just where to go, and controlling your first vehicle before you get the Bandit by mouse is EXTREMELY awkward for me.. the wheels don't move by A and S, it moves by the mouse. I know there's a term for that.. but I don't know what it is, and it is 2am in the morning.  Please - get this game. I promise you you will thank me later. And if it's gifted to you - thank that person. I have my own thanks to give. :)",

Co-op FPS+RPG featuring hilarious jokes, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, hilarious jokes, robots, lasers, hilarious jokes, spaceships, mutants, hilarious jokes, dragons, pirates, hilarious jokes... You get the picture.   The base game alone offers a lot. It took 40 hours to get through the story campaign, after which I was only level 33. The original side missions go up to level 50. Each of the DLC campaigns adds a full new story, new maps, new side missions, new items, and new skins. One DLC increases the level cap to 61 and another to 72, allowing you to unlock more skills for your characters. The 'Badass Rank' system is unlimited, so in theory you can get infinite stat boosts to make your characters infinitely powerful.   The two DLC characters are very fun to play. They feel very different from the original four characters by bringing unique playstyles. Gaige has a giant pet robot of doom, and a stackable Anarchy mechanic which encourages you to sacrifice accuracy and clip size in favor of chaos and explosions. She also has the most adorable catchphrases. Krieg is a psycho (one of the enemies you commonly face) and is actually more effective without shields and when he's lit on fire. He regains his health by decapitating foes with a buzzsaw axe and bathing in their blood. His catchphrases are very disturbing, and you will either hate him or love him. There is no middle ground with Krieg.  I played the first 40 hours solo, and after experiencing the story I started playing through the DLC campaigns co-op with my friends. I'm a completionist and there are a ton of achievements, so I'll be playing the side missions and exploring the world to unlock everything. Co-op is definitely a fun experience, but the game offers a lot for solo players as well. I've played so much and still have not experienced most of the content. This game is definitely worth the money.",

            "review_text": "I have unregretfully poured just a little over 400hrs into this game. It's been nothing short of amazing and definitely ranks amongst the Top 5 this generation. The gameplay, story, drop system and dialogue are MASSIVE (and I'm not exaggerating) improvements over the first game. The main quest doesn't feel as tedious, bland and empty as BL1, in which some will give you the chance to earn slight bonuses, consisting of stronger weapons, shields or even character skins.   One of the major overhauls I love the most is the Badass Rank. Completing levels of challenges will increase your BA Rank and give you a token whi you can apply to stat increase for better accuracy, longer duration of DoT effects (shock, fire, corrosive) or overall damage. And your BA Rank is applied to all characters that you create (my BA Rank is around 31,000 or so) so you can start off a new character and be extremely overpowered but in the long run it will pay off as True Vault Hunter Mode will greatly amp up the difficulty. More so with Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (not recommended until Lv61 because of level scaling). You can also earn skins from these challenges as well.   Of the core classes available you have Axton the commando, whose Sabre Turret shreds up everything when deployed. Going down specific trees allows the turret to fire rockets, set of a radial nuke or even grant the ability to deploy 2 at once. Maya is a Siren, much like Lilith but instead of Phase Shifting for an advantage, she can use Phase Lock. Phase Lock surrounds the target in a orb when invested into skills like Elated, Sweet Release, Helios and Chain Reaction, you'll set the enemy on fire, drain health (and restore it to your friends) and transfer that orb to the next target. Gaige the Mechomancer (who was available as a preorder bonus before the game launched) has Deathtrap. Deathtrap is basically your scout who'll rip apart anything in sight and his abilities are further amplified when going down the Best Friends Forever tree. I've invested a few points into BFF myself but I'm more partial to Little Big Trouble. LBT primarily focuses on Shock damage, in which some weapons (and shields) can make Gaige literally invincible.   There's much more I can say here but I'll wrap this up with: If you see it on sale, better yet the GOTY Edition which includes all of the DLC (not the paid skins) you are definitely getting a huge bang for your buck. 10/10.",

I could play this game and never tire of it, and it's that kind of endless re-playability that makes Borderlands 2 one of the best buying decisions you'll ever make. A word of warning though: make sure you have at least one friend to play it with. Multiplayer is what truly makes this game worth playing every single day. Sure, playing the campaigns solo is fun and satisfying on its own, but with a friend (or friends) the game takes on a whole new dimension of enjoyment.   I love every bit of dialogue in this game, the writing is spot-on hilarious, and even emotionally touching at times. And the weapons....oh, the weapons~ Searching for rare, legendary or otherwise badass weaponry is a reason to play in and of itself. It seems the possibilites in this world are truly endless. It's an action FPS on the outside, sure, but I love just how much of an adventure RPG-element there is at the heart of the game in terms of style and character skill development. You care about the characters plights, as well as the story itself. Borderlands 2 really has its own personality, and you can immerse yourself completely in this crazy world.   Another thing to mention is the DLC. There are plenty of extra missions to choose from, and it only adds to the replay value. In fact, you're much better off just buying the Game of the Year edition since it includes a lot of them. Since I mentioned RPG's earlier, I will specifically suggest Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep as my favorite of all the DLC missions. If you enjoy Magic the Gathering, Final Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons or anything like it---you will experience a nerdgasm with this one.",

            "review_text": "This game is brilliant. There's no other way of putting it. This game is fun in single player, and super-fun in co-op. Gameplay: - There is nothing more satisfying in perhaps any other game than seeing a stream of CRITICAL damage indicators streaming off a psycopath/midget/fat person/robot's head. - The variety in guns, grenade mods and shields is unprecedented. In co-op, you'll constantly be comparing your gear to that of your friends, trying out their weapons, trading weapons. All of the gun types are fun to use - especially revolvers. I swear they're magical or something... - The game is a well-made hybrid of FPS and RPG. You can give your character (one of 4 classes in the base game, with 2 more in the GOTY edition) abilities and level them up, enabling you to use better weapons, grenade mods and shield.   Story: - Ridiculous humour that works - that about sums it up. You'll encounter crazy situations and missions, but you'll just accept it. - There's an awful lot of it. The main story missions don't often feel recycled, presenting you with different challenges every time. There's plenty of voice acting in both the main campaign and side quests, whcih is impressive considering the volume of these. - There are a fair few unexpected plot twists, but it usually doesn't feel dragged out. - Handsome Jack is both formidable and funny. He's a truly worthy nemesis. - Claptrap makes you want to kill him within 20 seconds of meeting him. I've yet to hear a voice on par with how annoying Claptrap's is.  Graphics and Sound: - If you crank the settings up, this game looks pretty nice. The cartoony style means it also runs well on lower-end PCs without looking muddy. - If you have an NVIDIA card, you're in for a treat. There are cloth and liquid PhysX, and you can cut the cloth with bullets. Debris flies off the environment and bounces off things. It makes hectic situations look awesome. - Gun sounds and voice acting are great, everything else is generally OK, not too special. - I've had a couple of unexpected slowdowns and 2-second freezes. This shouldn't happen on my PC really, but I suspect it's PhysX related. I keep PhysX on Medium or High, though, because it's great.  Multiplayer: - The game has 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. All missions work in both single-player and co-op, with enemy volume and health scaling to keep difficulty constant. - You can start duels for loot with your fellow players, in the event of disagreement. - Pretty seamless. Invite players to your game from the main menu, and they drop into your world with all your mission progression. - I'd advise that everyone has a different class, otherwise you'll all die at the same time and respawn back at a checkpoint, which gets annoying. - For best experience, everyone in your co-op session should be within about a 10-level range of each other, or the underlevelled character will need reviving constantly.  Summary: This game should be compulsory. My life is complete, now that I can shoot midgets with shotguns and find cool loot in portaloos. My advice: buy GOTY - you'll want all the Borderlands you can get.",

            "review_text": "There’s nothing quite as subjective as comedy and the characters of Borderlands 2 will either irritate or please, sometimes even both in equal measure. From the weird rap nonsense of Tiny Tina to the cackling, evil tones of Handsome Jack, Borderlands 2 is built on a bizarre world that relies on how much you enjoy its colourful cast of characters. And for us, we definitely loved our time with these crazy people. While a continuation of the story seen in Borderlands, it’s not imperative that you have played it in order to understand the story. The sequel being most welcoming for newcomers giving the player four new characters to control, the commando Axton, the siren Maya, the gunzerker Salvador and the assassin Zer0. All four of these being Vault Hunters, new to the planet of Pandora who have found themselves in a trap set by the games villain Handsome Jack. Once escaping said trap they team up with Claptrap in order to help bring down Jack and stop him from using the vault for his own nefarious means. There are also the returning characters, including the original Vault Hunters from the first game, and the more secondary characters like Dr Zed and cosplay favourite Moxxxi. Each coming with their own selection of missions and comedic moments. A smile was definitely raised when invitations to Claptrap’s party had to be handed out, none of who chose to attend, cue awkward dancing and hanging around for a couple of minutes while bad music plays. The framework of Borderlands 2 is close to the original, with loot being grabbed, missions being collected and a whole host of creatures and soldiers standing between you and Handsome Jack. It’s neither an update nor a revolution of the mechanics, more an evolution. The FPS gameplay still remains largely unchanged. Shooting feels great with the amount of guns at your disposal staggering. From sniper rifles to shotguns, each weapon has a specific manufacture that comes with their own strengths. With some giving specific damage types, such as corrosive and fire, with some guns even exploding when they’ve ran dry. This also carrying into the grenade types and shields. The way you approach each combat situation largely depending on what weapons you have equipped, making each battle somewhat tactical, especially when certain enemy types are weaker to certain elements. Coming up against a robot? Then give corrosive weaponry a try. It’s one of the most satisfying shooters in some time. Then there’s the added ability each character comes equipped with. The commando Axton for instance is able to drop a turret once the skill is fully charged. This then can be levelled up once you gain experience points, as well as the usual shields, health and weapon damage. With plenty of side missions available there’s plenty of opportunity to raise your characters level, with each mission handily letting you know whether this is a too tough for you at your current ability or merely a walk in the park. Of course, much like the original the game really comes alive in multiplayer. Joining your friends for missions is a delight and works really well. But that’s not to say it lives and dies on its online multiplayer. Even in single player the game is a blast with an absolute ton of content, the world of Pandora being a massive place with variety far outweighing that of its predecessor. From large desert lands that can be traversed by vehicle, ice covered mountains, all the way to luscious green fields and towering structures, there’s plenty to see and do. Made even more impressive with the vibrant Borderlands art style. A cartoony world, with a visceral edge, as limbs fly and heads explode. The only issue with the graphics being the texture pop-in. An issue that plagues far too many games, as it takes a number of seconds before all the textures finally appear. What the original Borderlands did so well has been grabbed and near perfected with this sequel. The comedy may be hit and miss, but it thrives on its shooting and loot grabbing. Many hours of fun will await you in Pandora. 10/10",

There are six characters. (Two of them are DLC) All with their own playstyles and personalities. The six Include: Axton The Commando (He's like Roland in the first game with his turrets and stuff), Maya The Siren, Salvador The Gunzerker, Zer0 The Assassin, Gaige The Mechromancer (DLC), and Krieg the Psycho (DLC).  With 3 skilltrees with each character, your playstyles for the characters can be limitless (Probably not).  There is a looting system where you have to fight a boss for a unique weapon/item or legendary weapon/item. They will have a 1/30 chance of dropping the items. (They did make drops more frequent so I don't really know what the chance of an item dropping is now)   The weapons and items all do different things, with different stats, so you would like to get the best one to become a true Badass.  The leveling system: In The third playthrough (Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode) will have all items and enemies scale to your level, There are two DLCs that increase the level cap: Those 2 Vault Hunter upgrade packs (I don't remember what they're called, so sorry), The first one will increas your level cap from 50 to 61, and the second one (You need the first one for this) Increases it to 61 to 72.   There is also something called Overpowered Levels: After you reach level 72, you can go into a place called 'Digistruct Peak' in which you can increase your level even further, as the enemies are tougher, and you can level up to Overpowered Level 8 (Level 80).

The improvements include    +hundreds of sparkles from explosion guns; + fire looks like fire now; +the corrosion goo now oozes out on the ground and cascades down the slopes; + the battlegrounds are now littered with pieces of rocks and gravel (that do not disappear by the way); the electric guns now display more sparkling effects; +there is now some sun glare +there is now aurora borealis +there are some nice snow and desert effects +the anti-aliasing has been greatly improved +the day to night shift has also been improved  The Cons: -the water looks pretty much the same though -we still get Directx9 -Visually, everything about the game has been improved except that you still cast no shadow and you still can't see your legs -The Resolution problem. okay so I thought I was playing with my native 1920x1080 resolution until I figured out (at level 10) that you needed to change the resolution one more time IN-GAME.

Thanks consoles!  Okay as for the gameplay:  It remains largely unchanged however there are improvements. The sprint effects are now more realistic. One of the things I liked is that it is MUCH MUCH harder to earn money now. I reached level 18 and rarely had more than $ 1500 bucks in my pocket. This is a breath of fresh air considering that you could easily rack up $ 200,000 by the time you hit level 15. ( I am not even mentioning the exploit of cloning artifacts and rejoining friend's game to essentially have infinite money). Also, I should mention that they now got rid of all those unnecessary zeroes, as in, there really is no reason to sell a gun for $ 254,620 when they could downplay the entire currency by a factor of 1000. Ergo, you would have to buy the gun for $ 254 instead.  The skill tree is somewhat the same from the first games with some similar perks.  They now added Eridium as currency, which is rare. Except you can only use it to upgrade your ammo/grenade/backpack capacity.  They haven't changed the driving. It is still a keyboard+mouse driving which still sucks.  They also now added caravans which can get attacked and then get looted for rare weapons.  The elemental effects largely remain the same. Fire is good against flesh and corrosion is now really effective against armor (robots don't have shield or health anymore, only armor). Also, robots are easily taken out when their limbs are blown off.  It seems like the auto-assist weaker than in the first game but it can still be felt.  The enemies are even more hilarious now. The voice acting is great (same goes for THE friendly NPCs), especially when you hear the midget armored goliaths talk. It's obvious they try to overcompensate for their vertical challenge by being extra badass. The enemies still do the barrel rolls, they still take cover and can spend up to 5 seconds and they can also jump from platform to platform. There are also the buzzers (make-shift propelled helicopters much like in the mad max movies) which are pretty fun to shoot down. It's even more fun when they sing the Ride of the Valkyries composition (from Apocalypse now), it's pretty amusing. Some midgets ride on each others' heads too.  I'm not too sure about the insects though. They are gross and disgusting to fight.  In general, it is still way more fun to fight humans or rather, the humanoids, rather than the robots and the beasties.  The weapons: I'm not sure if it's me but it looks like they put more effort into adding more flare to almost every other gun. The seemingly random-generated stats are still there but at least gun skins look more flamboyant and peculiar. They also varied the standard appearance types somewhat. So, not every rifle gun is necessarily elongated for instance.  The story: It's a continuation of the first story (perhaps a couple of years after opening of the vault) wherein The Handsome Jack, who is in charge of the Hyperion Corporation is attempting to open an even bigger vault and obtain control of the prehistoric monster to rule Pandora. The story has some twists, surprisingly and it's always welcome to see the good old friendly NPC's again.  In the end, perhaps this could quality as Borderlands 2 since it's a continuation of story and all, I just didn't really feel like it was a new installment all that much, a lot of things feel same, although it's a definite improvement over the old one. There is more narrative, more quests, new enemies, new artifacts, mods, etc. etc. But there is not necessarily more depth, perhaps it is so because of the type of game itself. However, there are plenty of comical and satirical moments that catch you off-guard. The game is also littered with easter eggs.  ",

            "review_text": "First time I've heard of Borderlands 2 I was like 'Meh, another blurry movie, Borderlands 1 FTW'. But then I've got a 'pirated' edition of the game. It was SO AWESOME and without any doubts I did remove it and got BL2 + Season Pass + Preorder DLC + Mechromancer pack. What's so awesome about it? Let me explain. First: 'traditional Borderlands' humor. Violence, black humor etc. It's not annoying or way too brutal. Just fit the game setting. Second: awesome characters, story line, dialogues. Even though Handsome Jack is a villain of the game - he's awesome as well. I were waiting for all the ECHO transmissions, never skept any cutscenes and did all the side quests. A lot of entertainment here. Third: of course, it's graphics. You can say 'booo, battlefield 4 has better graph' - you're kinda right, yeah. But nobody cares about 'realistic' graphics here. It's like you're playing comics. Fourth: nice characters. I can't say they have an awesome storyline (but i did like Maya's story at least) but gameplay aspect is just headsmashing. A lot of variants how to play each character, way better than Borderlands 1. Fifth: DLCs. Yeah, eve though you can say 'RIPOFF!!! TOO MUCH DLCS!!! THEY'RE NOT WORTH ANY CENT!!!'. Actually they ARE worthy. Not kidding. 4 DLC's included in a Season Pass providing SO MUCH CONTENT. And all the content is not like 'Meh, they'll buy it anyway'. No. They're detailed. They're providing experience that can be compared to the base game(and imo Tiny Tina's DLC is even GREATER than the base game). Sixth and the last: co-op play. 'Adventure time. c'mon grab your friends, this time we'll play the Borderlands'. Nothing to say. It's SO GREAT for co-oping. It's awesome when you can count on friends standing behind you, ready to help, revive or even heal you. In total I'll say this game is definetily worth EVERY cent you pay for it. If you like GOOD action games - you should get it. My overall score is TEN out of TEN.",

It has a nice feel to the game with the cel shaders and the fact that nearly every weapon you pick up is pretty much unique. The campaign is enjoyable and always keeps you interested, with the changes of scenery and the variety of new enemies. The four player co-op works very well, up to three other people are able to join your place in the campaign and help you with areas you are stuck on.   The only downsides to the game are the fact that once you win the game the first time, to get to the level cap you have to play the game again with gets rather repetitive (especially if you have the DLC which makes the level cap up to 70). Another downside is the fact that the legendary weapons are very rare and you have to spend hours farming the bosses to find one.  Overall, this is a great game to play with your friends for the price (especially when it's on sale). You can have some very fun and enjoyable moments with them through the campaign and I highly recommend this game.",

This is one of the few games, I can actually call a sequal. It takes all the good stuff from its predecessor, makes it more awesome and then adds tons of more awesome stuff. Amazing.  This game has a certain kind of humour and I suppose you have to like it, but when you like it, it can be amazingly funny lots of times. The story, most characters and even quests usually have this funny touch from time to time. The thing is, it does not try to be cool and copy some jokes - it actually is boss good.  But still: This is a FPS. And also kind of an RPG. Hence the term RPS. And it actually does combine both elements really great. You always feel like you're doing progress by blowing stuff up. The weapons are great and there are about 1.21 Gazillion of them (I made a reference there, did you notice?).  Apropos: Gearbox likes references. So they put so many flippin awesome references in the game, me and my friends had seemingly infinite amounts of fun with this game.  If you are going to get this, get at least 2 friends to play with you and also get all the 4 story DLCs, they have extended awesomeness in them!

            "review_text": "A game for the masses. The casuals, the hardcore and the lurkers.  Are you walking around endlessly, wondering what to do? Did you decide to check out this game, but yet aren't sure? Do you want a game experience, that'll include hours upon hours, of hilarity and a good co-op and solo experience?  Borderlands 2 is just for you.    The game introduces you, and within the first minute you greet Claptrap. A robot you'll grow either fond of, or find to be like 'Pinky' in Pinky and the Brain. The voice acting in this game is beyond imagination, and the hilarity and focus upon entertainment and comedy is higher than I've ever experienced before.   Characters such as Tiny Tina, Marcus, Lillith and many more, greets you with a little cutscene, explaining their personality spot on. You'll get a specific, individual feeling about all of them, and you'll get to experience why.   The game introduces you to a story quest-line, but as you venture into the game, you'll quickly come to realize the numerous amount of side-missions available. The majority of those aren't of no reason, and feel dull and boring. No, in fact, many of them still focus on the great dialogue, and the exceptional story this game is so very known for.   The gameplay runs smooth, is very polished and introduces you to great characters, an RPG-type feeling, great opportunity to play with friends or just people you spoke with in the past. Even as far as new people! There's great community groups, and easy ways of meeting other Borderlands 2 players. If you find yourself getting lonely in Pandora, you can find new friends any moment you wish!   When you fight your way through the normal difficulty, you are quickly introduced to the second, more difficult experience that is 'True Vault Hunter Mode' (and later the third difficulty; Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode), which will drastically increase in difficulty. You'll find some bosses seemingly impossible in a surprising manner, and normal Psychos, Varkids, Bullymongs and many more to swarm up on you, quickly making you a dead-man walking. An easy target. But that's not it. When you think it gets close to unbearably difficult, you are introduced to the REAL game. The challenge that will or won't prove you worthy. But not to worry, you have lots of side-missions to prepare you for the challenges ahead, and tons of knowledge to learn about your class individually. The endgame is filled with world-bosses, designed to be slain with friends, but could potentially be slain alone. Seraph vendors selling some of the greatest loot, Tcoins giving you opportunity to buy legendary weapons in bucket-fulls, if you decide to invest your time in the game. Rare loot, that you can farm for many hours, but still feel totally hyped about, jumping around once you finally see that pistol dropping.   The game also introduces you to several classes; Axton, Salvador, Maya and Zer0. (Plus Krieg and Gaige from DLC) All with seperate skill-trees, ultimate-ability and playstyle. Out of these classes, you are sure to find one that suits your individual taste in gameplay, and you'll soon find yourself growing incredibly fond of your character.   If you played the first Borderlands, you will find it funny that the old classes; Lillith, Brick, Mordecai and Roland are mission-givers, and support you as you venture into Pandora. Not only the old classes make a comeback, you'll also greet characters such as Scooter and Angel. With genius dialogue, touching moments, awesome explosions, epic guns, polished gameplay, incredible voice acting and some of the best comedy in any game I've ever tried, I decide to rate this game with a well deserved 9/10, and certainly my zeal of approval. Any fan of a game that supports individual playstyle, decisions and expectations will surely enjoy this game!   There aren't many flaws in this game, but I have to mention the few there is. You can find yourself jumping around, trying to skip over a mountain to get to your objective in a quicker manner, but unfortunately see yourself getting stuck in a hole, having to save and quit, and start the past perhaps 10-15minutes over. (You will not lose your experience-progress, and I see this as a rather small flaw.)  The chances of a boss dying just as it jumps away, leading to it flying in the air is very slim, well, barely a possibility... But unfortunately it can happen that your loot will then fly off in the distance, impossible to find again. Either that, or it literally flew out of the map. Again, a very small flaw, that you possible won't ever see happening to you, but sure if a possibility.  When you progress in this game, there is a usualy flawless save-system, but it can be problematic. If your game bugs out just before another 'checkpoint', you could end up having to spend those 10-15minutes again. I haven't found myself getting a roll-back, losing the XP I gained in the meantime, but I've heard of such.  The dialogue can be interrupted by talking to another characters at times, and you have no way of listening to it again, untill you get to next difficulty, or replay.  No seperate loot table (both a good and a bad thing, but when playing online, you can easily find people looting EVERYTHING there is, so you're left boned!) - There is a way to dupe items though, so if you co-op, you can essentially both get the item, if that's how you prefer it.   Unfortunately, this is a written review, so I will finish off here. And if you've read this far, I'm sure you're already filled in enough, so you feel ready to enjoy the unlimited amounts of fun and one of the most superior game experiences out there! If you haven't yet gotten this game, I cannot do anything, but tell you: GET THE GAME. NOW. It's amazing and unbelieveable- An experience you NEED to have!  Rating: 9/10, and my zeal of approval!  Pros: - The dialogue in this game is beyond awesome. - Gameplay is smooth, both for the casual and the hardcore. - For both the social and the loner. - Has one of the best villains ever! - Ingenious eastereggs. - Oceans of both story and optional missions. - 100+ hours of incredible content. - Lots of DLC to enjoy. - A lot of endgame material.  Cons: - Little to few bugs, glitches and exploits. - Save-system can be problematic. - No character-customization. - Loot-system seems clunky to some.   I hope you enjoyed reading my review, and I hope I've inspired you to try out this amazing game!  Thanks, Mr. Reegen",

The DLC for this game is astronomical as well, but it does make up the better part of the content. If you are looking for a sci-fi - dark humour - loot fest - RPG hybrid, this game is perfect for you!  Pros: - 87 Bajillion guns - Controls feel tight and precise - Skill trees are well panned out - 4 classes that all play differently to each other, with an extra 2 if you buy the repsective dlc packs. - Brilliant story line, it's both emotional at points and funny at others - Mr. Torgue (he is worthy of having his own pro - Trust me) - Great with friends! - Well built wiki, this game has been out for a while, so its wiki is good. You won't be needing it too much though. - Quite a large amount of background lore, for all those book worms out there.  Cons: - Can feel a little repetitive at times, but it's not usually too bad and these sections are generally over quite quickly. - While there is a lot of guns, not all these guns have different models, so you sometimes feel like you're picking up the same weapons - Can feel a bit drained without a friend, this is generally only a problem for people that have either played lots with friends or not at all with such. Other than that, the average player won't feel that problem  This game is definitely worth your time and money, it's a perfect sequel to the original game! If you've got a friend, get this for them and get it yourself too, they'll be thanking you soon after. The good definitely outweighs the bad and it's a very polished formula.  9/10",

So don't get me wrong for the review below, but:  I never hated jumping mechanics and invisible walls more than in this game, ever! Or map designs that make you cover a distance by going on an arch or a zig-zag to reach your objective just to add more gameplay time, and this happens especially in the dlcs. The first two aspects persist from the first game, but the third.. oh man. Also on that note I hated the most all the quests in Tundra Express given by Tiny Tina, because the entrance to her cave is located in exactly the opposite direction of all the objectives except one. I can't even remember how many times I've cursed the developers for making me run around a god damn rock to turn in something, just to get another in almost the same spot.   Also the story is kinda forced and lacks character which made me quit the game two or three times before level 25 because I didn't connect with what was going on in it, and this is the first game I've pre-ordered! I still prefer the first Borderlands for that where you actually care about your hero and what's going on, you wanna get involved in changing the situation.  Other than that it's still a great game built in the same manner with a lot of content that can keep you playing many hours alone or with friends and they did improve on the later part, connectivity becoming easily accesible which is great because that's why we're all using this Steam platform after all. So I can see why it lacks in some content, just to make up in other related to the multiplayer category, like the badass ranks and bonuses and all the playthroughs (hell in the first game max health and shields were in the two to four thousand limit), so the players have something to return to that doesn't feel absolete after just a few hours.   I hope to see a Borderlands MMO one day, which seems they're getting closer and closer to and might be the perfect game yet as the developers usually listen to what the community asks for and they constantly improve the new releases on that matter.",

            "review_text": "Greetings Badass or potential Badass.  Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite shooter. It is an awesome mix of a shooter and a complex story full of mad humor. As a warning: This game is really full of splatter scenes and mad side-kicks so if you look for a simple not that wicked story-based shooter, Borderlands should not be your choice. You start in a snowy landscape were you meet the very annoying little robot, Claptrap. He helps you for the first missions, were you ahve to fight your way to Sanctuary, the last rebell country, were the Crimson Raiders, stand to fight the Hyperion-Corporation and his leader Jack. The whole shooter is on the planet Pandora, were everything is very modern, for example Laserpistols, but always mixed with a nice shot of magic, which you can control, if you play the Siren, which is one of the 4 character types you can play in Borderlands. Each one has his own skilltrees and an action skill, like a placeable turret, which you can improve in the skill tree each level.  The world is very big and very varied. So like i said there is a snowy area, a desert area and mining caves or lavaseas. The missions have always a nice background story and are very nice to play. The most missions are to go to some points, pick something up or kill somebody and fight your way back to the employer. Some other types like defending places or deliver packages in a short time are also included. This does not sound like very variable missions, but because of the nice world, without repeating areas every single mission has his own touch, which is improved as well because of the background story. Just the deliver missions were sometimes annoying, but with just 3 or 4 missions of them it is not bad.  Another good point for the game is, that if you play alone, the enemies are less stronger than with a friend, so you can go alone to save Pandora or go with your friend. Another good thing for the multiplayer is that if you collect money or get a reward your friend will get the same amount, so you never have to fight for loot.  In the beginning of my review i already mention the sick humor of the game. Full of Eestereggs and references to games or TV Shows the game does not look that mad, but for example in one mission you have to capture a bandit for a 13-years-old female, which torture him than and drink some tea with him on an electric chair and all her teddys. They are some more of these scene which explains the 18+ sign.  For people who likes that humorstyle and look for a very very very long story (played 40 hours just for campaign and all side missions), the game is definetly a good choice.",

            "review_text": "Borderlands 2 is a really good game if you love shooting people and collecting loot, especially the awesome guns. What you probably won't like though is that it's really REALLY repetitive for some people. That's one reason that people may not like this game. The other reason is that, in this game, you kind of need to grind a bit because in the later places of this game, you might find yourself getting owned. And finally, my third reason that you may not like this game is: the level difference. I'm talking about when you join a friend's game and find out you're a bit behind.  Okay so it starts normally, you're shooting enemies right? And then you notice, your shots are doing so little damage. Your reaction would be: What the ****, why is my gun useless? Yeah, that will happen. It really reeks of donkey ♥♥♥♥ how that works. Anyway moving on, if you can ignore all of that, this game is great.   (Like me, I like this game even though it's shooting people and collecting loot. I bought the goty edition of this game even though I already had the original just for all the dlc :D)   Characters: The characters of this game are really well acted. I like how Handsome Jack is a kind of villain that's likeable though you still hate him. Cl4ptr4p is annoying though. I heard the C14PTR4P from the original Borderlands was much better. I honestly don't know since I haven't played much of the first game. And to be honest, I didn't really know the story of the first game since it was really vague. Tiny Tina is also an interesting character so to speak. Her backstory was really interesting too, for me.   The playable characters you can choose from are: Axton, Maya, Salvador, Zer0, Gaige, and the latest and last playable character, Krieg. I will summarize all of these characters' main abilities.   Axton is a (bisexual, lol) guy who can summon his turrets to fight alongside him (or with his friends too). You can further upgrade his ability so that when he summons his turrets they can have a shield sphere, or when you summon it, it can cause an explosion which damages the enemies near your turret. And also you can upgrade your turret's gun which makes it stronger.   Maya is a siren, who basically has an ability called phaselock which allows her to trap her opponent in an orb that makes them unable to move. You can further upgrade this so that it can cause effects like slag, or you can make it a supportive ability which you use phaselock on your friends to heal them.  Salvador is a kind of um short and plump guy who has the ability to dual wield any two weapons of your choice. Sniper and rocket launcher, check. Pistol and assault rifle, check. Smg and smg, check. Basically any weapon combo you want, it's possible.  Zer0, this guy is too awesome. He's an alien guy, who can turn invisible and slash enemies with his katana. I can't describe him much. The info about him is really vague. And yes, you heard me right, he is an alien. (Or possibly, it's heavily hinted he's an alien though.)  Gaige is girl with a mechanical arm who summons Deathtrap, a robot that she can summon to fight for her. To be honest I haven't played Gaige's char yet. So idk what she really does well in.  Krieg, now this is where it gets fun. Have you always wondered if you could play as the psycho in Borderlands? Ohhhh boy, well if yes then, this is for you. No? Well then, this is still for you. Imo he is my favorite character next to all of these char. I can't really pick my fave character because I like all of them, but Krieg is my favorite if I'm forced to pick. This guy is so awesome to play with. I recommend you get the Psych0 pack dlc if you haven't. His special ability is that you use your axe and ♥♥♥♥ people up. Yes, I mean that literally, okay maybe not but still. He is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.  You either throw the axe at those mofos or chop the ♥♥♥♥ out of them yourself. Not only that, you can also upgrade his skill tree which makes him more awesome. Basically, you got downed? No problem man, get the ♥♥♥♥ back up and strap a bomb to yourself. Then when you explode, bam, you get revived. There's also something SUPER MEGA FOOKIN AWESOME. When you upgrade his skill tree high enough, when a time comes your health is low at a certain level, you transform into a badass psycho and..... holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, get ♥♥♥♥♥ rekt. You can rek them like there's no tomorrow.  Sound: Hmmm, this section is going to be short. The sound is what can I say, okay I guess for this game. There's not much music going on that makes me really want to fight. If you count the opening song though, that song is awesome. The gun sounds are pretty good. They sound great if you ask me. I'm not really a gun sound expert but it sounds fine to me. Great sound.  Visuals: Unlike some people, I actually like the cell-shaded style of this game. It's what makes this game Borderlands. It probably wouldn't be the same if they tried to make the graphics different. The visuals for this game are really good. I like the landscape, the ice areas, lava, eridium blight. All the places in this game are well done. Props to Gearbox for making this game spectacular. Awesome visuals.  Plot: I'm not going to say much but the plot of this game is great for me. It's a game about where you're a vault hunter who is searching for the vault in this game. And throughout the game you encounter Handsome Jack, the main villain, I already described him but basically he's a likeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In the beginning of the game, you are discovered by C14PTR4P who is shocked to see a vault hunter like you alive. After that you go through fights and then you reach Sanctuary. Here is where the main cast of Borderlands 1 are in this game. (Lilith, Mordecai, Brick and Roland) At this point you're going to meet the Firehawk and then rescue Roland. You basically meet all of the original cast of the first game and you work together to defeat Handsome Jack. It's a good story imo.  I would say this game is well worth your money at the 10 dollars I spent during the Steam Summer Sale. As I said, I already owned the game, but I decided to buy goty for 10 dollars which is the same price for the season pass. (Goty is the same price as the season pass, the season pass contains all the main story dlc which is in the goty. The goty edition has additional dlc like the Gaige and Krieg char pack.) So if you own the game, I would recommend you buy the goty edition if you want the dlc of the season pass. Back to the main topic, this game is well worth over 10 dollars to be honest. It's the best RPG FPS I've ever played. (Not counting Deus Ex because I consider that sci-fi) If you didn't already have this game, I would suggest you buy it. Good job Gearbox, you did a good job. I'm a bit sad about Aliens: Colonial Marines. But in this game, you've put an outstanding amount of work into it.",

I think the graphics are unique, allowing you to recognize Borderlands anytime. The combat is smooth, and intense.

Not satisfies with all of the side quests? Ready for a harder difficulty? Jump into True Vault Hunter Mode and grind your teeth and enemies until you get to level 50. Still not completely satisfied? Yearning for just a bit more fun and loot? Try out Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and prepare for the harder-than-dark-souls enemies and bosses (but they drop more loot!). Picked up any DLC? Great! Head into one of those and bash some more baddies. Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack DLC's? Make your way up to level 72, getting the best guns in the game along the way. Doesn't sound fun? Doesn't sound like there is any variety? Personally, I can't think of anything to prove you wrong, but you'll just have to check out other stuff.   So, whether you're farming for that legendary or fighting your way to that last raid boss, Borderlands 2 is sure to satisfy even the most treasure-hungry person.

The voice acting is top notch and the music adds a good amount of atmosphere. The gameplay feels more refined than the first by that I mean they added a mini map, more customization, etc. The shooting works well for what it is, but I think they could make it more satisfying. Honestly what makes borderlands a rewarding game is finding a new weapon or leveling up more. The feeling you get when come across a new gun and using is such a great feeling in a game.  Now in terms of what I dislike with the game, well the biggest one is the humor. It's really forced and it's just a bunch of internet memes, since that's what the writer considers 'humor'. Now I do appreciate that the game attempted to put in a narrative, and while the humor falls flat the actual writing is good mostly and the characters are well done. In terms of other issues well sometimes borderlands can feel a bit samey in places.  That being said the positives out weigh the bad, though it's not everyone it's a solid title.  8/10",

The main game without DLCs takes about 40 hours if you do every last one of the Side quests, upon completing the game you unlock a New Game+, NG++ is unlocked by DLC. DLC wise, the game does boast alot of them, though not all of them are worthwhile. If you want to spend money on only one of them, you should probably go with 'Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep', because it is not only the longest one of the four add on stories, but also features completely new enemies and dragons.

My friend said it was amazing, so I thought what the hell. I am so glad I brought it.  The Humour is ALOT better than the first game. (Tiny Tina!). The graphics are alot more colourful and varied than the first game. There is hardly any glitches in the game, which really annoyed me in the first game. The story actually has a good few plot twists that fit in well with the RPG elements of the game. Actually, the RPG elements are very good. I like loot based games such as Diablo 3, Torchlight, and I'd say that Borderlands 2 is on par with them games. Also, the in game UI is also alot better, and they added a mini map. A MINI MAP!  The world surprised me as well. The characters in the game are some of the best video game characters ever produced. All of them are memorable.  Overall, I loved Borderlands 2 and was one of my favourite games of the 2012 releases. It is a vast improvement over the first game and is a very replayable game as well.  I give Borderlands 2 a 5/5.",

There is also a lot of replay value considering there are between 4 and 6 classes depending on whether you buy the GOTY edition/DLC packs, also the main campaign plus DLC can get you 25-40 hours in playthrough 1 alone, then there is True vault hunter mode and Ultimate vault hunter mode which can lead you to play even longer. There is also up to 4 player co-op which makes the game even more fun, however single player is also extremely enjoyable  The only issue I have is the loot system, which will probably cause you to have to farm for a decent amount of time to get that legendary you want.  Overall Borderlands 2 is a great game and I would strongly recommend buying it (buy the GOTY edition). 9.5/10.  Edit: I forgot to mention, the DLC campaigns do not scale to your level so you will probably wind up being level 40 fighting level 30 enemies, it isn't necessarily a negative but it's not a positive either",

The game plays like any other FPS game you have ever played and takes away fall damage. It has so many DLC's that just ad more to the game so you can play if you already  playd the entire game. The 'Game of the Year Edition' already ads enough more things if you play the game for the first time. It's also great when you play it with 1 friend or more to not only get better loot, but make the game more fun to play. I'm already level 26/27 and I still enjoy it!

Borderlands 2 is one of the games where the DLCs (mainly campaigns and ultimate vault hunter packs) are COMPLETELY worth buying, adding so much more into the game.  We're talking about: -2 more playable characters -4 more campaigns which includes more loot and UNIQUE weapons to be found. -Max level cap at 72, meaning more skill points to wreck your enemies -Level 72 not enough? Get overpower levels (up to 8) to make your enemies scale up to level 80+ and find level 80 weapons in the process. (Also a DLC) -5 Head hunterpacks, optional if you're willing to spend some cash to spice up a little more missions. If you love open world games with a mixture of RPG values AND coop features to play with your friends, would definately recommend this game. -Ranks to increase stats that apply to ALL characters by completing tasks As for storyline, has many aspects in it, of course, definitely humour The only cons i see in the game is tedious farm for EXP towards end-game ONLY if you are playing multiple characters. Its a pain to level each one of them to level 72 (Only if you have both vault hunter packs) if you really felt like doing that in the first place, unless of ocurse you have the patience to do so. Overall, in my opinion, i enjoyed the game and i do still have plans to continue here and there. ",

The 3 skill trees per class, along with the ability to respec your character whenever you'd like provides a lot of replayability and customization;  + The pop culture references were great additions, whether they were side-quest related or spawnable bosses (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Donkey Kong, and Batman to name a few)  + The game never takes itself too seriously (I looted a gun named, 'Bulets Go Fasterified Plasma Caster', and no that is not a typo...)  + After beating the game, you can restart at the beginning and do a 'Legend of Zelda: Second Quest' version of the game, where you bring over your equipment, money, and experience and fight scaled-up enemies for better loot;  - The only minus that comes to mind for me is a very preventable minus. It's easy to get overpowered for the DLC if you don't play them at the right point of your playthrough. After I beat the game, I played the Pirate's Booty DLC and nothing really scratched me.   ** One thing I would like to add is that Borderlands 2 GOTY edition is the type of game here on Steam that goes on sale quite frequently. I purchased the GOTY edition for $7.99 (as opposed to the normal $39.99). After about 180 hours of play time, I daresay that was probably the best $7.99 I ever spent :) So if you haven't pulled the trigger on playing this yet, and your wallet is not overflowing, bide your time and pick it up on sale at some point this year. You will definitely get the most bang for your money this way.  (Those gun puns were unintentional...maybe.)  ",

I was talking it over with a pal of mine, and we agreed that Borderlands 2 is like the potato chips of games: you're in the bag, up to your elbow, telling everyone around how you much you hate these chips and you're not going to stop eating, even though you're full, until you hate yourself.

Though, I do have a minor problem with the save system, as my level, upgrades, and items would be there, but I would have to beat a slew of enemies again or beat a boss again unless I fully complete a mission, which sometimes can become frustrating.

You do missions, you shoot stuff, you use badass powers ,you kill stuff, you loot stuff. Fun all around You do this for tens of hours and it never gets boring ( a sign of good game design)  The main missions are fun. The side mission are better, as they range from crazy to funny and usually a combination of the two. You do often really weird stuff for both old characters from B1 as well as brand new and just as crazy new characters (meet the teenage girl explosives expert who does tea parties and talks like someone from GTA)  The gameplay is as crazy as the rest of the game. As one (or up to four) man (or woman) you take on bandits, beasts and the evil Handsome (meh) Jack. You choose from a variety of gun types and a variety of crazy powers to kick ♥♥♥. And did i mention those guns have crazy powers too? Well they do - like the explosion Torque weapons which blow stuff up or the tediore guns which you can turn into grenades. There's also in-game achievements. You get these for pretty much every thing you can do in the game. As you complete more of these you can boost your stats to be even more badass.  The playthrough should give you tens of hours. But wait, it's not over yet. You can get dlcs and kick new ♥♥♥ in new areas. Or you can start the game over in true vaulter mode, where you keep your level and your gear but every enemy is stronger. And then once more with ultimate vault hunter mode, where amazingly enemies are even stronger and kicking ♥♥♥ is even more of a challenge. Or you can start the game again with a new class which plays in a very different way.  So to sum up. Borderlands 2 is a funny game which plays well and plays for a very long time indeed. I'd recommend getting it because the gameplay is such a lot of fun, but also because this is a game where you really get your money's worth.  ",

            "review_text": "SO, I'm actually doing a review. OK then...    So first, why, did I get this game? Because I'm a veteran Vault Hunter, who played Borderlands 1. Now, what I expected from this was simply... bigger. Larger world, larger story, larger number of guns (In which Gearbox decided to break their own record for most guns in a game, which was previously held by Borderlands.), and a bigger amount of fun. And you know what? I got all of that, but you don't need to have played Borderlands to be able to fully enjoy this (But I do recommend.), all you need to do to really enjoy this, is to want to shoot something in the face. Moving on, this game, storywise, was, y'know, sort of loose at first, just regular, wanting to be the hero kind of biz, but then, things get freaking serious. And, by that part, some of the fights aren't as much putting bullets in every soon-to-be corpse, as just having everything against you, you not having the upper hand, just a matter of survival, not gaining or losing ground. But those 2 kinds of fights in the game, are what I enjoyed most. At one point, 'Should I play with others?', well, that's a pretty retorical. One of the joys of playing this is to bond with other gamers, have someone to share a laugh with as you hear this game's hilarious dialogue. Have someone, to have seen how awesome it was, when you made a dude burst into flames. Other benefits: Well, more players= more enemies, more enemies=better loot! You also have someone to keep you from dieing throughout a firefight... And you're only one person, so the benefits of playing with the other characters won't be able to help you out. You can play solo... if you want, but I recommend playing with others more than 50% of the time. And so, we talk about graphics and how it feels running this. I... am not at all very knowledgable about this topic. All I know is from hearing my friend obssessing over 'how it looks playing Crysis 3 on MAX GRAPHICS SETTINGS!' So how the graphics are. In this, they have a bit of emphasis, I guess. on the lines and outlines of things. The lines are thicker or thinner depending on how well you have your graphics set up. Also, texture quality gets really nice as you go up in the settings. But now I shall tell you the wonders of the PhysX option. I forgot most of what I know about it, but it gives added realism, like the water looking more realistic, ton of other liquid-enhancing crap... Also the ability to shoot cloth and leave, not a little dent, as if it were concrete, well with this, nope, you get to strip a tent of it's cloth by shooting it! Other things like that, too.   So the altogether Borderlands 2 experience? Amazing. Fun. Memorable. And every synonym for those words. Just... what I expected out of this experience.   Rating- 9.6/10.  Recommended Type of Gamer: One that feels like having multiple ways to kill a guy and laugh about it... and feels like doing that with friends.",

            "review_text": "Borderlands is one of the best game-series ever made in my opinion. You can play it for 200 hours and there will still be something you didn't find yet.    Gameplay:  First things first - You get further in the game by doing quests BUT every quest is kinda unique and I don't feel like doing the same thing all over again. (Except you are playing the game again and again. In this case you really do the same thing over and over again... but it's still fun!) The best thing about this game is it's great sense of humor. It doesn't take it self very seriously even though you will recognize that there is a deeper story going on under all the jokes. At some point it feels like an MMO mixed with a FPS and the detail and humorous story of an indi game. I don't see any way how this could go wrong! :D   Combat: I've never had such a variety of weapons in a game before and with those different kinds of guns there comes a whole new feeling to all of the fights. You can start of by picking the obvious enemys with a sniper rifle and take the rest out with a shotgun that makes everything explode around you. And I'm not even talking about the legendary weapons yet. When it comes to combat everything is up to you. There is no 'whaaat you want to use this weapon? sorry but you took that class so you can't use this!'. Just take something that looks nice to you and tare the world apart!   Characters: You will meet a lot of different characters through out the game and everyone is insane in a different way. You will even get background information about some people by doing quests or finding random stuff. The Characters are one of the biggest reasons why this game is so great!   Leveldesign: The world could look a little boring when you look at it but it really isn't. There is so much going on and things are changing as you move forward in the story. You can find secrets and eastereggs all over the place but they are sometimes really hard to find. In general the world is split in different areas which you can explore so it's not fully openworld but it doesn't feel like you are forced to go a specific way. For me it solves the problem of wanting to explore the world and every little detail in it and fully losing track while doing that. You are free to look around but you still get to where you have to go.   Looting: I think that's one of the biggest parts of this game. You will lose count of how many cases and lockers you've looted really soon but you will find new weapons and ammo in it so you should try to loot everything you see. The ammo runs out really quick on some weapons so keep an eye out for the green light which marks a lootable object.   Lategame: You will finish the main story kinda quick (depending on how many sidequests you are doing and how much you are into exploring) and that will be around level 25-30. But it's not even close to being over at this point. You will just unlock the next stage of the game at this point which means that you start a 'new' game but you keep all your levels and stuff, just the story resets and the enemies will now be on your level again. There are some quests which you can only do if you are level 50 or even higher so it's worth the extra time you are spending. And as i said earlier, you won't be bored since the combat is so much fun and you will develop even further, getting stronger weapons and all that nice stuff. And if you are level 50 in the end and everything is done, don't you worry mate, there is still a ton of DLCs and other playable characters to try out! Borderlands 2 may be released some years ago but it's not even close to beeing dead! There is still stuff released for it and it get's better the longer you play it.   Bad Stuff: Of course there is something bad on every game, so these are my greatest problems in BL2.  - Sometimes when you kill an enemie and it drops loot or throw out something of your inventory the items will fall through the ground and be gone for ever. I lost quite a high amount of my legendary weapons this way. So always search a save spot for something like that or use the trade option.  - There are some quests which lead you right back into an area which you've already cleared and it's a bit painful to walk that way all over again especially since you have to do that twice for every character since you will have to replay everything to get a highlevel char.  - The pizza at Claptraps party is cold. (Insider xD)    I really hope i could help you with this one and thanks for reading :)  For me Borderlands 2 is a must have and I promisse you - you won't regret it!",

You can hang out with your friends and kill raid bosses or play the campaign, or you can join random people and just have fun doing whatever they are doing. All in all the shoot and looting in this game is really good, however, some legendaries don't drop often enough to make it worth farming for. However, when you finally do kill that boss you have been struggling to kill or finally get the legendary you've been wanting, it feels really good. It makes you feel like you actually earned what you got.  Secondly, the story is absolutely amazing even though at some times it feels a bit repetive, for instance 'Kill this thing and pick up what it drops.' This happens a couple times in the story and in the side missions. All in all, I really recommend this to anyone who likes fun first person shooters with a lot of humor at some times. Each character feels unique and different from the others, whether its a playable character or just an Npc. Honestly I think you will have a good time playing and my final rating for this game is a 9.5/10.  ",

The original Borderlands was built around a mechanic made by Gearbox Software. Randomized weapons and components. It was a great engine component and many people credit Gearbox for inventing the 'shoot 'n loot' genre. The first game didn't have much of a story, it was just built around the game mechanic.  Borderlands 2 made an extreme improvements. To list a few: enhanced mini-map, enhanced HUD, a entertaining story, better vehicles, character customization and better loot. OH GOD THE LOOT. The writers at Gearbox clearly put a lot of time into writing the story, making it funny, charismatic and witty. It is one of the highlights of the game. The graphics of the game has improved greatly as well. It has integrated Nvidia PhysX into the game and engine and recently been compatible with 4K, at the sacrifice of 60 fps.

Now to write an actual review (kind of):  Like it's predecessor (which is aptly named 'Borderlands', for those of you not astute enough to realise), Borderlands 2 is a fusion of genres, namely murdering and looting. You slay large crowds of enemies with weapons such as the 'Murdurin Slagga' and the 'Bandity Pistal' and then loot chests for stuff that's probably not as good as what you're already using.  In all seriousness, it's an RPG/FPS fusion, full of dark humour and pop culture references. Well, not necessarily pop culture, but references that many internet/gaming veterans will get. From suicide side missions to crude sexual innuendo, this game is full of fun for....not quite the entire family.  The main storyline is decently long and there's plenty of side missions and replay value, so you'll definitely get your money's worth of playtime out of this game.  Whether you're a bandit or not, give Borderlands 2 a try. It might just become a favourite.",

            "review_text": "There's so much I can say about this game, it's enjoyable to play by yourself, just plug your headphones in and listen to music whilst you enjoy your time. You can play with your friends doing quests, trading, duelling each other. I myself online, offline and on my PS3 have put a few thousand hours in this game altogether and i've loved every last minute of it! the gameplay is enjoyable with there always being something that catches your eye and then being your main focus.   There's a range of easter eggs throughout the game some more subtle than others but all placed in the game the correct way which makes us search for them and work together as a community to find them all. The mass amount of guns allows for you to play however you'd like to and also creating your own fun little challenges which affect the way you play the game massively.   (small spoilers ahead)  The story itself is quite enjoyable when you get deeply involved and attached to characters, personally from playing the first game there were characters that I was happy to see back and locations which were from the first game too but changed and developed to follow along with the plot. The villain in this game has got to be one of the best i've seen in awhile, how he talks, finding out about what he's done to other people in the past, his own daughter (which I know some people have mixed views on). The story is designed to introduce you to new areas, enemy's and also teach you that you objective may not be given to you straight up in a way which lets you explore the area and makes you use your brain when searching for items. The level progression in the main story missions makes it so you the player need to do side missions to get more experience and become a higher level whilst also making you explore new areas the you wouldn't have come by otherwise.   There is a total of 4 characters in the base game and an additional 2 making there 6 if you purchase them, i'm gonna start by talking about the base 4.  The commando: His ability is that he sends out a deployable turret that can become a killing machine if upgraded in one of the 3 skill trees that he has. Without spoiling too much this includes adding a shield surrounding the turret, adding rockets that fire from it and making it explode like a nuke when it's deployed. His skills make him very deadly when using assult rifles by increasing their damage, fire rate and reload speed. I started off playing as the commando because of how many different play styles there was with him, for someones first ever time playing through the game and learning about what guns are best, what element is best against certain enemy's I recommend the commando.   The siren: The siren is one of 6 that can exist in the universe at any given time, she is able to 'phase lock' her enemy that is small enough in to a orb in the air allowing you to damage them whilst they're vulnerable for around 5 seconds. The siren is based around elemental damage in all forms; increasing the elemental damage all together, increasing the elemental effect chance and allowing you to inflict elemental damage with a non-elemental gun. Using SMG's with the siren is where she shines the most with there being a wide range of SMG's with elements that you can access early in the game. Playing as the siren I recommend to be done once you understand how the element system works and what works best.  The gunzerker: This is my favourite character to play as during the late game, the gunzerker's ability is that he can duel-wield any guns for around 20-30 seconds (before skills come in to play). During his gunzerk he is regenerating ammo slowly for the gun type currently being used such as pistol and shotgun however, the one ammo type that can't be regenerated is rocket ammo. His skill trees vary how he plays massively; you could be create a gunzerker who can basically fire forever without using any ammo when at low health, a gunzerker who can flip off his enemy's and get most of his health back instantly. I recomment to play the gunzerker after researching his skill tree first so that you can plan out how you play the game.   The assassin: This is the character i've played the least out of the main 4, he is a strange and mysterious person that we don't really know much about. Zer0 the assassin is able to vanish whilst deploying a decoy for 5 seconds where the next attack you do does considerably more damage but will remove you from your invisible state. Zer0 can be played either at long range with a sniper or up close with his melee attack doing massive amounts of damage and if it kills the enemy will allow for him to deploy another decoy and let you remain invisible for a few seconds longer. I find him the least entertaining to play out of the base 4 but he can still become a very powerful character to play as if you know how to build him.  The DLC in this game includes head hunter packs which gives you unique skin customisation for your characters, the main DLC stories which include: Captin Scarlet, Sir Hammerlock, Mr Torgue and Tiny Tina's assult on dragons keep. Then there is the other 2 characters the mechromancer and the psycho.   The mechromancer: This character's ability is she summons a death trap which chases down enemies and then slices them with razor sharp claws. Similar to the siren the mechromancer is very skilled with using elemental weapons mainly shock weapons increasing its damage output and effect chance, you can chose to either develop and improve on your character's damage output and make you the badass or you can turn the death trap in to a flying death machine which can shoot electricity at ranged enemies, gain a copy of your shield and clap its hands together causing a large explosion. When you want to play for fun and have a really entertaining time playing i recommend using the mechromancer for this experience.   The psycho: This character is designed for all out brutality, his ability is to run around with a large buzz axe and slice through his enemies, being damaged allows for him to regain his ability faster which when working with certain builds can make him almost invincible. The most common and powerful build turns you in to a raging badass who can chain expload his enemies with ease which when fighting large groups of enemies in a small space makes him deadly. You can also follow the path of lighting yourself on fire and then getting increased damage whilst ignited. To use this character you will need to do some research before hand to ensure that you get the best build possible as some skills can be difficult to understand so I greatly recommend this character but only after gaining information about him.   Overall I can recomment this game to anyone who enjoys FPS, farming and insane games, when i say insane i mean it as in the world that the game is based in and you have to live in with the story line, crazy characters you meet along the way and the ones you also play as. It's easy to pick up and play but hard to put back down afterwards I hope this helped anyone wondering if they should get this game :)",

The game has a lot of content (in terms of DLCs) and if you enjoyed the humor from the first Borderlands you'll have plenty of it in BL2...

You can't pick the stat you want all the type, but you do get to pick out of 5-6 stats that are random (or change with every level).  - You can gamble all the extra money you have for Eridium (a rare currency used to increase your ammo capacity and inventory/bank size).  - You can transfer the items from your characters through claptraps hideout. So if you've found a super nice class mod and think you might play that class, you don't have to store it in your bank or inventory.

It is totally okay and even sometimes necessary to die, which is definitely a feature not as common in games that I have played. Sometimes it is also difficult to find a loadout of guns and abilities that work for you, so it is key to explore and experiment with different brands and gun types and stats and ability trees. Especially try out the different characters, because you will very likely find a specific one that works best for you and is your favorite.  If you love comedy, being involved in action, honing your aim, battling giant monsters, shooting up a storm in a camp full of bandits, delivering amputated limbs to mailboxes, performing mad science, opening loot crates, getting your heart torn out, using badass powers, working together with teammates/friends/family, and having a great time, this is definitely the game for you.  10/10 would Vault Hunt again",

            "review_text": "Borderlands is one of the best game-series ever made in my opinion. You can play it for 200 hours and there will still be something you didn't find yet.    Gameplay:  First things first - You get further in the game by doing quests BUT every quest is kinda unique and I don't feel like doing the same thing all over again. (Except you are playing the game again and again. In this case you really do the same thing over and over again... but it's still fun!) The best thing about this game is it's great sense of humor. It doesn't take it self very seriously even though you will recognize that there is a deeper story going on under all the jokes. At some point it feels like an MMO mixed with a FPS and the detail and humorous story of an indi game. I don't see any way how this could go wrong! :D   Combat: I've never had such a variety of weapons in a game before and with those different kinds of guns there comes a whole new feeling to all of the fights. You can start of by picking the obvious enemys with a sniper rifle and take the rest out with a shotgun that makes everything explode around you. And I'm not even talking about the legendary weapons yet. When it comes to combat everything is up to you. There is no 'whaaat you want to use this weapon? sorry but you took that class so you can't use this!'. Just take something that looks nice to you and tare the world apart!   Characters: You will meet a lot of different characters through out the game and everyone is insane in a different way. You will even get background information about some people by doing quests or finding random stuff. The Characters are one of the biggest reasons why this game is so great!   Leveldesign: The world could look a little boring when you look at it but it really isn't. There is so much going on and things are changing as you move forward in the story. You can find secrets and eastereggs all over the place but they are sometimes really hard to find. In general the world is split in different areas which you can explore so it's not fully openworld but it doesn't feel like you are forced to go a specific way. For me it solves the problem of wanting to explore the world and every little detail in it and fully losing track while doing that. You are free to look around but you still get to where you have to go.   Looting: I think that's one of the biggest parts of this game. You will lose count of how many cases and lockers you've looted really soon but you will find new weapons and ammo in it so you should try to loot everything you see. The ammo runs out really quick on some weapons so keep an eye out for the green light which marks a lootable object.   Lategame: You will finish the main story kinda quick (depending on how many sidequests you are doing and how much you are into exploring) and that will be around level 25-30. But it's not even close to being over at this point. You will just unlock the next stage of the game at this point which means that you start a 'new' game but you keep all your levels and stuff, just the story resets and the enemies will now be on your level again. There are some quests which you can only do if you are level 50 or even higher so it's worth the extra time you are spending. And as i said earlier, you won't be bored since the combat is so much fun and you will develop even further, getting stronger weapons and all that nice stuff. And if you are level 50 in the end and everything is done, don't you worry mate, there is still a ton of DLCs and other playable characters to try out! Borderlands 2 may be released some years ago but it's not even close to beeing dead! There is still stuff released for it and it get's better the longer you play it.   Bad Stuff: Of course there is something bad on every game, so these are my greatest problems in BL2.  - Sometimes when you kill an enemie and it drops loot or throw out something of your inventory the items will fall through the ground and be gone for ever. I lost quite a high amount of my legendary weapons this way. So always search a save spot for something like that or use the trade option.  - There are some quests which lead you right back into an area which you've already cleared and it's a bit painful to walk that way all over again especially since you have to do that twice for every character since you will have to replay everything to get a highlevel char.  - The pizza at Claptraps party is cold. (Insider xD)    I really hope i could help you with this one and thanks for reading :)  For me Borderlands 2 is a must have and I promisse you - you won't regret it!",

            "review_text": "I picked up this game a long time ago at Best Buy because it was on sale for about $10. I had heard great things about it and knew it was a great PC game and I had played a good bit of the original Borderlands and liked it as well. It took me over a year to really sit down and play it a good bit (Note: Gameplay was post Destiny release) I've got to say after playing Destiny fairly heavy for a good week and half, beating the current campaign, all strikes, exploring all the maps to the fullest and finding most gold chests, alot of crucible and achieving 3 pieces of legendary gear, for me Borderlands 2 is the better game by a pretty good margin. There is wayyy more variety in the guns and gear you get on Borderlands not to mention how cool the guns and gear actually look. The more you progress in the game, the cooler the guns look obviously. This didnt seem to be the case in Destiny, you could have a level 1 gun beside a level 20 legendary gun and wouldnt really notice any difference other than the stats of the level 20 item. Also the armor ranging from the world and the other five factions had very little variety at all and didnt seem like something I really wanted to work towards. They always claimed the maps to be so massive in Destiny, and they were for the most part, but after playing Borderlands 2 I quickly found out this game was just as much or more ambitious than the new title with tons of different locations to visit and a good variety of weather and terrain it kept the entire game up to the point im currently at very entertaining. Alot of the locations are also very memorable in Borderlands 2, you can remember when you choose to side with either the irish guys from overlook or the rednecks from the dust map each time you pass through the areas and so many more other things. Another thing is the humor and voice acting in this game is some of the best out there, there are some parts that will seriously make you laugh out loud typically with the rednecks in the game they are pretty hilarious. However in Destiny ive got to say the voice acting was awful, probably the worst thing about the game I couldnt believe from a game with that kind of team and budget that the voice acting was so bad and unimmersive, not to mention there was 0 humor in the game (not saying there wernt attempts) Another thing is the story in Borderlands 2 is so fun and action packed and never gets dry because the characters and locations are changing so often, you may do 3 missions here 2 there and 3 for some other guy before you ever even go back and touch a main storyline mission. This is another thing I like is the game doesnt feel linear whatsoever. You can choose however you would like to play it whether that be knock all the story quests out back to back (which may be hard due to having to continously level your character up for certain parts of the game) or do side missions and explore for loot to make sure your character will be fully adept for the main storyline. In Destiny I really dont even know what the heck went on in that game, I ran, I shot, i took cover, fought some boss that took 45 mins to kill and moved on to the next mission on the planet in which I didnt really know why I was there in the first place other than to try and reach level 20 (Which is the current soft level cap) As much as I wanted there to be a cool story, it just wasnt there in Destiny, however you could look at it as you make your own story with your friends as you play through the campaign in co-op, but who really wants that kind of story? Last thing i'll mention is how long and how much playability there is in both games. I know in Destiny I played the game pretty heavily for 2 days before i beat all strikes and missions and reached the level 20 cap. All i really had left to do was the same missions and strikes or crucible to try and find light armor to continue leveling my character. There was no more story, no more xp, no more anything new, just hopes of finding one more piece of better gear after 4 hours of gameplay, and this is only 3 and 4 days after release?? However in Borderlands 2 i've put in 36 hours in the past week and a half and still have not beaten the game and am level 26 (Soft level cap of 50, 72 after all dlc) I like to play alot of the side quest and have done tons of those to make sure i level enough and to get all of the story. There is just so much to do in the base game alone and thats how it should be honestly, not spanned out through dlc over 10 years. There is a ton of great dlc content for Borderlands 2 which i have not purchases or played yet but viewed some gameplay and it looks like alot of fun, Id like to beat the regular game first before i buy anything extra for the game. I know it may have sounded like I bashed Destiny a little in this review, it was a pretty good game overall despite being repetitive and having almost no story but i figured it would be a good comparative for Borderlands 2 since ive seen so many people compare the two already. I was really stoked for weeks about the release of Destiny and went to the midnight release so im completely unbiased, but ive got to say im kinda done with it. I know there will be alot more dlc to come but I dont think it will change things much other than putting you in a new mass location with more grinding for levels and waves of things to shoot. If anyone is looking for a new fps shoot and loot with great replayability, Pick this up right away (Preferably GOTY edition I wish I had) you wont be disappointed.",

So you pick it up for later only to eventually run out of space in your backpack and trust me, it fills up QUICK. But overall this is a very fun game with almost infinite replay value.",

            "review_text": "Loads of great humor, unique style and madcap weapons. A game has rarely made me smile and laugh so much.  It’s a sci fi shooter with a cell-shaded style just the same as the first game. Although there is a greater variety in the environments this time around. The humor is great. The characters are full of personality and the hilarity keeps coming without ever getting too much, aside from Tiny Tina. She's not racist like a lot of people are claiming she’s just too full on and loud.  This game has a bigger focus on plot. Where as the whole of the first Borderlands was just leading up to a final objective, here you will play a part in an actual story. Feeling more involved along with the aforementioned area variety are a big step up in your immersion in the world. You can coop play with up to 3 others but unlike the first title you don't have to be in a team to have the most possible fun.  This is a loot based FPS with more guns than you can shake a stick at. The drop rates require some dedicated playing in order to get the guns you really want. The guns truly are the focus of the Borderlands games. There are several manufacturers that each have distinct game play and aesthetic features. For example Torgue (NOT Torque! &gt;:( ) weapons exclusively use slower velocity, but high power explosive rounds. They have a checkered design. Vladof have very high rates of fire and have a silver or gray finish, with a hammer and sickle or star printed on them. Maliwan typically produce the best elemental guns and have a very sleek sci fi look about them.  Elemental weapons can be fire, corrosive or electric or slag. Using the correct element verses the enemy you're engaging will do a great deal of bonus damage. Likewise using the wrong elements will reduce the damage you deal. Slag guns cover enemies in the substance, which causes them to take double damage from other damage types/elements. Explosive damage and non-elemental guns tend not to be resisted and give you some safe, reliable damage choices.  In general the guns are very silly, but a good silly. Things like rocket firing assault rifles and guns that fire rounds in strange patterns. There are many bizarre and fun guns to find. The exact same gun can spawn with very different stats, which can still be the case with guns of a similar level. Or the same gun could come with a different element. This variety of factors makes for thousands of different guns. A great deal of variety also applies to the other types of loot too. That's why it's frustrating that storage in this game is so limited. You have to make mules just to keep a lot of loot.  As you level up you'll be picking skills and gradually finding better loot for your current level. You've heard it all before. It's the 'multiple classes, leveling, finding better gear' routine. It’s not any deeper than that but it is done well. Aside from guns there are loads of different shields, relics, grenade mods and class mods to find. Class mods buff certain stats and add points to skills. Grenade mods change a grenades behavior and damage type.  Each class feels unique thanks in no small part to the unique ability they can use when combat gets challenging. This is called the 'action skill'. The Gunzerker can dual wield, the Commando lays down a turret, it’s the major factor that separates the them. The characters have three different skill trees each, along with their action skill. You can have a variety of different builds even if you only have the level 61 level cap (the level cap gets raised with certain DLC's). You can get many skills in two of the trees once you hit your level cap. You can respec skills as often as you like if you have the cash.  You can also customize your character's look with different heads and skins. A lot of these are DLC but plenty are unlocked in game. Unlike the first game you can't choose a colour scheme. Your choice of skin dictates the colours you use, as well as their placement on your character. I would have liked to have had more choice in terms of the colours. It feels like a step back even though we now get head customization.  The death penalty is loosing cash. Also enemy health will be fully restored upon your death. That's not a big deal a lot of the time but it’s a game changer against bosses. If your health is reduced to nothing you enter fight for your life mode. When this happens you drop to your knees, unable to move. If you kill an enemy you gain a second wind, getting back on your feet with some restored health. The tense moments, praying you get a second wind before your time runs out make me really enjoy this mechanic.  There are vehicles to ride, which your coop partners can join you in. They're nothing special to be honest. They do help you to get around big area's that would otherwise be tedious, but the combat is average. You can also select different skins for them.  There are a huge number of DLC's. I've found the most enjoyable to be Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. There is so much optional content to choose from. This game is huge. If I didn't have many other games to play I could easily get 1000+ hours out of Borderlands 2. The DLC's don't just add quests they also add more gear.  WHAT OTHER REVIEWS ARE NOT TELLING YOU  For your average to low skilled players this is what can ruin the game despite how wonderful everything else about it is.  When you reach the 3rd play through (after completing the game you start again, keeping all your loot and current level) you are forever forced to play at the hardest setting, Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. You are forced to stay on UVHM as you can only reset the game on this mode of difficulty. Resetting the game allows infinite play throughs while keeping your loot and level. Once you have completed the 1st play through and True Vault Hunter Mode there is no reset for either of them.  UVHM is so tough it massively increases enemy health, gives them health regen, their damage output is such a stupendously high level that you can be in Fight For Your Life after just a few shots and the use of slag is mandatory. Mandatory if you want to survive. In a game that allows for a massive CHOICE in firearms you are forced to play a mode that LIMITS CHOICE?! What utter contradictory madness is this? Even shields are made useless so there goes the great feeling of looting a nice shield.  However if you're willing to muck around a bit I have come up with a solution.  THE WORKAROUND  This review used to be thumbs down. Due to finding a work around in combination with how great the rest of the game is, it now gets a thumbs up.  So you're the average to low skilled player? UVHM has ruined your fun? Follow these steps for infinite TVHM play.  1. Make several 'mule' characters that function only as storage for loot 2. Store most of your level 50 loot with these mules. Keep one level 50 load outs worth of loot in storage on the character you wish to play TVHM with 3. Endure UVHM until you're at your level cap 4. Retrieve your level 50 loot from storage (so when you start TVHM you have access to gear that doesn't make you OP from the start) 5. Download and use a Borderlands 2 Save Editor and reset your TVHM progress 6. Use the level 50 loot you have stored away for the duration of the game 7. When you complete TVHM again reset your progress 8. Repeat steps 1-7  Your skill points may go above level 50 but that won't affect the difficulty much. All that matters is that the loot you use against level 50-54 foes is level 50. This stops you becoming overpowered and thus able to enjoy True Vault Hunter Mode again.  I can confirm there is a save editor out there. It’s easy to find. You can't get a VAC ban as this is not a VAC enabled game, so don't worry about using it. I don't condone the use of a save editor to cheat, only to give the TVHM option that should not have been excluded in the first place.",

While Skyrim, in my opinion, is the best RPG that incorporates FPS elements, Borderlands is the best FPS with RPG characteristics (XP, leveling, skills, items with numerical attributes). The game is really huge, specially considering the optional quests and the DLCs, that are surprisingly enormous! It is a kind of Far Cry, but much more exciting and miscellaneous!  You can experience 6 different character classes (in GOTY edition) and in 2 different game modes: single and cooperative multiplayer. The first one is more slow and technical, in which you'll need to search better ways to defeat the enemies, since having your health depleted is quite a problem; while the second one is faster and insane! As more users join the game, more 'run into the action and fire, fire, fire!' the game will be - you'll need to exit from your cover at least to help fallen friends in order to avoid their deaths! The cooperative mechanism of the game is awesome! The best part is that it is possible to use the same characters (a.k.a. vault-hunters) in either single or cooperative game. The unique annoying aspect, for me, is the excessive looting and the need of farming during all the time, searching for better items. It reminds me of Diablo a lot, that is a game completely dependent on farming, what displeases me after some game playing. The game is too cheap (with sales up to 80% off sometimes during the year) for the fun it is able to grant. One of the best aquisitions I've made. I'll buy the Borderlands Pre-Sequel in a near future, for sure! But, for while, I want to explore deeper what Borderlands 2 has to offer! After finish the game with a character, you'll have the possibility of replay it in hardest difficulties to keep your vault-hunter evolving. Almost infinite joy!",

Usually co-op is an afterthought, or not thought of at all. Co-op is the primary focus of this game, and has been absolutely perfected. Borderlands 1 was excellent, and the best co-op to date. Borderlands 2 fixes anything and everything that you didn't even realize you missed in 1, and for an experience that is extremely fun for all, easy to join or host, productive on both fronts, and endless fun. The non-stop add-on content they keep throwing out is great, lots of contests, as well as virtually unlimited loot combinations to make it always worth your while to keep playing. This has trumped all of my old favorites that are not even the same genre (I typically hate FPS since I can't compete with those that play 24/7/365 and don't have things like a job or responsibilities).

So why do i keep playing it? for starters i´ve met a lot of amazing people to play with (i´m mostly a single player gamer so that´s saying a lot) and the game is fun, is Char has an unique feeling about it ingame, so despite the fact that the endgtame has been narrowed a lot regarding viable builds and weapons it still has enough variety in its gameplay to make me keep coming back, i´have three level 72 chars, and i´m still working on my fourth (Zero) at 66 right now so if you happen to jump to Pandora maybe we can shoot something together",

The story is vastly improved compared to B1, and includes a strong antagonist in Handsome Jack. I really grew to hate him, which is a tribute to the quality of the writing and voice acting. I also laughed several times at the wacky sense of humour throughout the game. Theres easily above 40 hours of content including side quests and I encountered no significant bugs. There are minor negative points. Vehicle combat still sucks but fortunately it can be avoided for most of the game. The checkpoint only save system doesn't fit the huge maps. And occasionally characters will talk during the shooting. But overall, B2 is an outstanding game, and a strong contender for my top 5 GOTY.",

Both of my favorite genres in gaming, Borderlands 2 is a fun and great game that runs like a well oiled machine that keeps chugging with new content no matter how many hours I've pured into it. I orignally came across Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360 and immediately became attached to this game, so much that after spending close to 110+ hours with three normal and true vault hunter modes completed, I had to purchase it again on the pc and glad I did with the addtional 160+ hours invested (,most of which were offline and not recorded) I'm still finding new content and weapons to enjoy. So much so, that I've alreasy maxed my current level 56 siren inventory and bank with level 50+ weapons for my ultimate run if I decide to do so, with over 100 golden keys to spare. In short, if looking for a great singleplayer or coop with friends or be randomly joined with other players then Borderlands 2 is that game. The gameplay is superb, the story is well written and progress in a very solid pace, the backstory of Borderlands 1 is clear and precise and you feel like you can make a difference on Pandora.   Borderlands is my favorite fps, out performing Halo. While Halo gets a 97 out of 100. Borderlands as a whole gets a 100 out of 100. I applaude Gearbox for a superb game that takes what the original did and make it five to ten times better in almost every way. Borderlands 2 gets a 10 out of 10. Prepare yourself for the commencment of funtime mayhem solo or with friends in the end, it is worth the ride and one to remember for years to come.

Borderlands 2 is the perfect balance between a casual shooter and a serious experience. When playing this game you'll experience a variety of different scenarios. Among which can be really fun, or really frustrated. I've experienced a mission in which it reccomended level was obviously set to low. Ok let's make this easy to under stand. Pros: -Quick, fun gameplay -LARGE amount of weapons to choose from -Enjoyable dialouge -Decent story (Not to in depth) -Easy to pick up and play -Easy to run (Hardware wise)  Cons: -Can get stuck on a mission or area easily -No particularly easy way to level up -Can be difficult when playing alone  Overall I would give Borderlands 2 a 8.5/10. It is very enjoyable and is good for anyone who wants a casual, yet still fun, first person shooter.",

The game is funny, and serious, it has moments that will make you laugh out loud, and moments that will melt your heart, often these moments are seconds apart, and then claptrap will say something to ruin everything. The multiplayer is seamless and works very well. All in all, probably my favorite game of all time. Every game mechanic is made to give the player more entertainment. The fight for your life system makes the game hard to die in yet difficult to live in. The skill tree gives each class bonuses, but allows psychos to be good snipers, snipers to wield good shotguns, and sirens to wield bazookas. Each class provides a entirely different combat experience, and each DLC is worthy of its own game.

Handsome Jack is honestly one of the best Video Game Villains in recent history, They made you love to hate him, and he just had a knack to make you laugh.  The side quests were amazing a blast to do, and an great distraction from the main story. The writing is amazing, you come to love every character as you play the game more, as you learn their funny and/or tragic back stories. (My favourite characters were Personally Tiny Tina and Brick.)  Can't wait to get onto the DLC, just finished the game for the first time with my friend.

Personally, I think the level design is much more monotonous so while the replayability is fairly high, it's not enjoyable seeing the same landscape/environment more than once. I've noticed that the loot system isn't as interesting or randomised anymore either, there's only a set amount of legendary gear you can obtain whereas in the first Borderlands, every single legendary had random stats and a randomised name.  The DLC in Borderlands 2 is quite fun, each DLC is more developed and has a more interesting quest/storyline which interesting new characters in each one. my personal favourite was Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep because it incorporated so many RPG and Dungeon Crawling stereotypes and elements which made it funny and also interesting to play.  In my opinion, if you loved the first game for what it was and have high expectations, Borderlands 2 (preferably GOTY edition) is only worth purchasing on sale.   Rating: 8/10",

            "review_text": "At hour 117, I died by a legion of dwarf wizards.  10 | 10  Now, for WORDS.  This game is unlike any I have every played before. It's hard, fun, engaging, funny, satirical, progressive, and extraverted. First off, this game is not meant to be some serious 'masterpiece', and it doesn't act like it is. Although, I think it's pretty damn near flawless.    Pros:  + Enemy levels scale  well with character progression (on 'True Valut Hunter Mode', levels scale one to two levels above your own, which in turn, gives you tons of xp) + Character progression  is well balanced (can fully level out two of the three skill trees [if DLC has been bought] giving you the 'major ability' of two widly different trees) + Gives ample character choices  for the player (you got a Sniper who can go invisible, you got a tank who can dual weild weapons, a soldier who can plop down a turret (or two!), a 'magic' babe who can render even the hardest enemies useless (by entrapping them inside a sphere of awesome), a pyscho who loves fires (and meat!), and a 'engineer'-type girl who ams best friend with a Mech) + Fair challenge  with various levels of hardship (from downright easy to unforgiving) + Weapons  are an abundance with a variety of special effects + Humor  (I find this game funnier than a lot of other games and even TV shows. It's very unconvential and not 'politically correct', for lack of a better word) + There are enemies named  'Enraged Midget Goliaths', 'Suicide Skeletons', 'Badass Knights', 'Partially Digested Head Hunters', and 'Anchorman'. They are all as awesome as they sound.  + Sound effects  are stellar (never get tired of hearing a Goliath yell 'GET ON YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ KNEES FOR ME' in a very uneducated, slurrish yell. It's hard to describe, really) + Graphics (I was running this game on my laptop [Intel 3000 Graphics] on low and was running great, then I upgraded to a 780, and wow... this game runs beyond silky smooth, at even the most intense moments) + Easibilty  (I haven't played the original Borderlands, and walked into this game pretty much blind. It was very, very easy for me to get sucked in. Controls are great and fluid; I run a PS3 controller through a program and I am able to switch between controller and keyboard/mouse at anytime!) + Comfortability and Pacing  (This game doesn't force you to do anything. Hell, from levels 43 to 51, I did nothing but finish up side quests.) + DLC  (This is a pretty controversal pro, as some agrue it's just milking of a franchise/supports dev's to not sell a finish game, however I believe this game was finished, polished, and complete before DLC was an option. I'm not going to sit here and sell you on their DLC; you can [and I have], totally enjoy the game without it. I beat the game twice before I bought my first DLC! I recommend 'Tiny Tina's Assualt on Dragon Keep' the most, if you can only buy one DLC. The headhunters are pretty linear boss type locations, but for the price, are well worth it. The extra characters are great if your want to try out a new, unique build. The cosmetic items, are pretty much worthless, in my opinion. I don't see the point in buying a single helment for $.99) + Replayability  (YOU CAN CONTINUE PLAYING THIS GAME, EVEN AFTER YOU BEAT IT. Sorry for the yelling, but damn, don't you just hate it when you're playing an RPG and at the end of the game, right when you get the most sweet of gear after killing the most henious of bosses, the game is over? Well with this game, it actually encourages you to farm the end boss [for he rewards the deligient], and you can swap through difficulty's anytime, and continue their individual stories.) + Co-op  + Group Raids  (Took me four and a half hours to kill one of them [Pyrocaustic Pete the Invincible], on my own. Wasn't worth it, for the loot I got, but with a couple of buddies, I could see it being great fun)    Cons:  - Farming  (This game does kind of get to be a bit of a drag when you're at the higher levels of the game) - Spawning  (When you get injured enough, you don't die. You go into a state called 'Second Wind', in which you are able to fight for your life. Get a kill in this state and you'll be revived a percent of life back. Don't get a kill, and you die. You'll end up at the closest checkpoint with a percentage of money gone, and you'll have to fight all those enemies, again. I actually kind of like that, because then 'hey, that's twice the xp for me', but then again, you could be going through the most vicious cycle. [Pro Tip: If you're in 'Second Wind' and want to keep all your money, simply pause the game and exit and load back in. You keep the xp, gear, and money too]) - Frustration  of getting one hit by certain bosses (be careful of Tremors, that is all I can say) - Inability to customize weapones  (This game doesn't allow you to customize your favorite weapons, not even a little. Instead, it depends on the game giving you them: customized weapons. I really wish this was a thing, because, as a Zero main, I would love to deck out a sniper of my own, putting tons of upgrades into it. Instead, I am left having to farm bosses for hours upon hours to even get a 'percentage chance' of a drop of an awesome weapon.) - Money is pretty useless  (The only things you can spend money on is weapons, ammo, shields, and the occasional cosmetic item. This is pretty pointless as nearly every thing you shoot at drops weapons, ammo, shields, and the occasional cosmetic item. When you die, the game takes a percentage of your wealth [about 10%-20% depending of difficutly, I think], and that's about it. If there were some kind of shop where a user can customize their favorite weapons, money would have some value, but as of now, I don't believe it merits much) - Favorite weapon loss  (I have no idea how to title this one but use adjectives to describe it. The jist of it is, and it ties in with my past two con claims, that once you find that really awesome sniper rifle/shotgun/grenade/etc., it will become useless in a matter of a few levels. It will get replaced with a new 'favorite', however, sometimes it's not as a good. For example: At level 33 I had this awesome level 33 sniper that triple shot caustic [acid] rounds towards the enemy. It had a decent mag size of about 15, and laid to waste most everything in my way. For this reason, this was my 'go to weapon' whenever I was in a jam. About four levels later, that level 33 sniper was utterly garbage. Now, I had to find a new favorite weapon, and it just felt forced. I would much rather keep one gun, add my own self into it [with upgrades, etc.], than to have to rely on what the enemies/shops drop) - Drop Percentages  (Just because you've been farming The Warrior for eight hours doesn't mean you're going to get that legendary weapon drop. For the reason of spotty, non-cumlative, drop chances, I think it's a hinderance. Sure, I could just as easily agrue that by having low drop chances, the integrity of those 'ultra mega rare' weapons are saved; however, I don't think people should have to farm for hours upon hours and still end up with nothing) - Workshop Support  (A game like this, would be most legendary if Steam Workshop was implemented [custom missions, locations, weapons, bosses, suits, helments, characters, abilities, vehicles, etc.], however, that is not the case)  And that pretty much wraps it up. A fun casual, hardcore, game for everyone who loves blowing stuff up with style.   This is my first review, so sorry for the length. Also, feel free to message me if you have any questions. I'm not an expert or anything, but I do genuinely love this game.",

            "review_text": "I guess that after nearly 200 hrs in this game (currently 193 hrs) I am now able to write a decent review. So here ya go  So - what is Borderlands? Is it an RPG? Is it an FPS? It's combining both in a, in my opinion, perfect matchup.  I love this game. The story is overall pretty nice and the DLC's are completely awesome. Tbh I've never seen DLC's that are worth it's price such as Borderlands' ones.  The classes:     Zer0 | The Assassin: Zer0 is an overall awesome character/class to play and it fits with the playstyles of nearly every person. You can play him with Shotgun-, Pistol-, Sniperrifle-, Aussaultrifle-, SMG- and Meleebuild or just go for a Kunai build and use what ever weapon you want to play with. And you can get invisible, I mean, who doesn't want that? With Zer0 you have someone who can be played for fun as well as for serious business. Added to that he looks awesome and is mysterious, so he would be my first choice even if I were new to the game ayy.      Maya | The Siren: The Siren WAS the class for everyone who wants to support his teammates in an online game. Since the last patch you can play her better in solo games too because she got a DMG-Buff. With Maya you can play with SMG's or Pistol's best and heal you or your teammates with you action skill 'Phaselock', which stuns the enemies and makes them more vulnerable. Your decisions how to skill her depent on the choice to play either solo or online. And she's pretty good looking. Hands down.      Salvador | The Gunzerker: The Gunzerker.. well.. you want to play a spanish/mexican/whatever little dwarf that is mostly screaming and shouting at you while you run through hordes of enemies wielding two weapons at once and destroying everything? You'll looove Salvador. No, for real, the Gunzerker is the class for everyone who wants to make DMG in the game. Want to play a Rocket Launcher and a Sniperrifle at once? No problem.       Axton | The Soldier: The Soldier is the class for Newbies. He is not hard to skill and to play and can use most of the weapons pretty decent. Your action skill is a turret you throw into enemies and it's autoaiming at them, so, as I said, I'd recommend Axton if you just started to play or do not have many FPS experiences. I don't know what to add to that, sorry.      Krieg | The Psycho (DLC Class): You love Melee-DMG? You want to breathe fire? You want to throw axes at enemies and letting them explode in a wave of fireballs while your teammates can damage you to make you even stronger? The Psycho is your class! The Psycho is basically skilled on melee- and firedmg and can be used to 'tank' the enemies, because your action skill makes you going crazy, returning to full health and splattering the enemies with axes. You should play fire-based weapons with, but be carefull, there is a chance to set yourself on fire and still getting some profit from that.  And *SPOILER*   Krieg is the father of tiny Tina, a little disturbed girl living in the Tundra Express        Gaige | The Mechromancer (DLC Class): Gaige uses here skill to make bonus DMG if not reloading. Her squishyness and overall complicated playstyle make her not easy to use for beginners. She's an awesome class, no doubt, but hard to play if you don't exactly know how. I guess that's all I gotta say to her.   Now some Pro's and Con's.  Pro's:     LONG playtime, if you really are into the game     Godlike DLC's     Nice cel shading graphics     Pretty much endless list of weapons     Pretty much endless list of using your skills     The whole skill-system     Badass lvl's that do give you more power     Awesome written characters     A nice, open ending story     Pixelwalks and glitches that can be used in your interest     Lilith ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Con's:     Claptrap (start the game and you'll know what I mean)     Some annoying enemies     The vehicles (I personally like them but there are a LOT of guys out there that can't drive them properely)     Sometimes just really dumb AI    The normal maxlevel in this game is lvl 50, but if you buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack 1 &amp; 2, you will get to lvl 72. It's not neccessary, but if you want to get to the OP-levels, you'll have to buy them. The OP-levels basically are a way to make the game interesting after reaching lvl 72. There are 8 OP-levels and with each one your enemies are getting stronger and stronger, up to being lvl 90 while you still are lvl 72. You'll find a*s-destroying weapons that will help you to not just go in the fight and die all the time.  I would recommend this game to nearly every type of gamer. I hope this helped and that you will enjoy the game as much as I still do. :)",

Maya, The Siren - A Siren like Lilith. She can phaselock eneimes to render them defenceless and let the team blast away at them. Definetly the support class, with healing skills.  Salvador, The Gunzerker - Um, well, kill? Can use the skill to pull out two weapons at once....nothing more to say.  Axton, The Comando - Can deploy a Sabre Turret, like Roland, but slightly less powerful. Skills focus on accuracy, ammo, and assault rifles. For the more aggressive players.  There are two DLC characters, Kreig, and Gaige, but you'll just have to learn about then yourself. This game....is well, AWESOME. I can't explain the whole game other than this:  Kill, Explode, Loot, Kill. Crazy, Explode, Guns, Kill, Blood, Explode.  That's right. Three kills, and eplodes.  The storyline is great, I won't spoil it though.  One of my favorites.  What? You haven't bought it yet?!  Do it! Now!  Go one and buy the game of the year edition while you're at it! It's worth it!

The gameplay and graphics is extremely fluid after its prequel giving the user a better way to enjoy the hell out of this. The weapons system in the game are quite intuitive with its elemental scheme with a strategic sensibility on what enemies weak points are along with having just funny, creative names. I especially love the 8+ level OP gear that you get after a certain mission of the game if you're looking to REALLY be the true Vault Hunter.  For the humor....what can I say? Handsome Jack, Claptrap, Steven, and so many to name just few more are truly memorable for their funny antics and the way how both good and very evil it is. Jack is far by the most funniest, given that he is the main villain of the game, in the entire series. In the Pre-Sequel probably not as much and it'll be one of the reasons to come back to the second for that. Can't forget about Mister Torgue......BECAUSE REASONS! Not gonna spoil it, but it's worth listening and watching!  As for the story itself, I take it as it is and leave it at that. From beginning to end. Do want to see what will happen in the next sequel!  Overall, this game is worthy of its merits and up until now it's still enjoyable and lovable. If this was a movie I'd pay to go see it for sure!

The game has a very great story, unlike the first one. Heck, it's one of the very few games, that doesn't make you have to play the first one.  If you've seen the trailer(s), which you most likely have there's always a caption saying 'Bazillion of guns' which is right, but overexaggerated. The game has in total: 110,000+ different kinds of guns, with different variants and 8 weapon manufacturers. Which is mind-blowing. Finding the same gun twice is very rare.  Borderlands 2's amount of enemies is ridicolous, everything wants to kill you. Literally. Like, Bandits, The Hyperion Corporation, or just Pandora's wildlife. Enemies interact with each others, quite so often, that's it at the point of getting hillarious.  The soundtrack for this game is just amazing, especially with the 4 DLC campaigns. All 4 bringing amazing soundtracks.  My ONLY flaw with this game, is the Multiplayer. This is a flaw, that everybody agrees with. Whenever you play in a public game, you'll most likely end up with a greedy jackass. Picture this scenario: You snd your ally kills a boss, for instances. Chances are, your ally WILL rush to the one unique weapon that the boss dropped. See, this is the type of people that ruins the experience for everyone. Why can't there be one for each player? Trades can still happen, with these unique items, and everyone likes to use unique items.   Pros: • Cool story • Great Enemy AI • Hilarious Dialogue • Has the greatest villain ever. • Soundtrack • Weapon randomizer system.  Cons: • Greedy players.  But i recommend it. A lot, be sure to have somebody to play with you, or else the game is gonna be.. Quiet boring. 2-4 friends is what i'd recommend.  So yeah, go buy the game or something. Idk.",

            "review_text": "Now while I do reccomend this game (I have not played any DLC's though) I'm more interested in pointing out the negative things. I like the combat, I like the gameplay, I like the design, I like the story, I like the characters so there's not much to say there.   Edges &amp; Invisible Walls Right, so to start it off there are some annoying ♥♥♥♥ing edges here and there that are quite annoying. I'm talking about a piece of ground that is about a decimeter in height which stops your character dead in his/her tracks. They aren't littering the place but they do occasionally happen and my god are they annoying when you just wanna run somewhere fast and your character gets stuck on a little thing for no good reason. And there are quite a lot of annoying invisible walls so if you want to think outside the box and jump around to get a better position think again because even if your character could realistically jump up on something an invisible wall will pop up going 'no, you aren't allowed to do that'.  Dead-stop when jumping forward agaisnt certain things. Another thing you'll come across, most often with invisible walls but sometimes during other things as well is that if you are mid-jump and hit something your character won't continue to increase in height but will instead stop dead in his/her tracks. This can be quite annoying at times.  Don't bother out of the box exploration. Because there's nothing there. You think that because you could potentially get up on a certain place that there's going to be something nifty up there? Well think again. Most of the time there is ♥♥♥♥ all and you might as well not bother. I got rewarded for exploring areas by jumping up on them seldom. And I might be looking back at BL1 with rose-tinted glasses but I'm certian that I remember that we 'were' rewarded for exploring hard to reach places.  Too many guns. There's too many loot chests and guns in regular containers and the spawn rate of rare stuff is far too rare. 999:1000 guns are useless to you and you end up tossing them away or selling them for money. But apart from the very very veeeeery few times that a store/vending machine has something worth buying there is bugger all to use the money on except for slot machines (and the slot machines have way too low of a chance for the good stuff, I never got an orange weapon and almost every single purple and blue weapon were garbage), which are good to farm Eridium for (You use Eridium to buy ammo/backpack/bank upgrades. I dunno, it feels like the developers wanted the players to be given weapons constantly but realized that it'd be too easy to farm really good stuff so we end up with waaaaay too many weapon chests and weapon drops and way too low of a drop rate for orange or half-way decent purple stuff.  The enemies are too dangerous and my weapons are too ♥♥♥♥. You might come to a point like I did when my weapons simply did not pack enough of a punch to deal with the enemies in a feasible and fun way to progress the storyline so guess what you gotta do? That's right, farm. And like I said in my previous post, most of the weapons will be garbage, no exceptions. I had to spend 9 hours grinding weapon chests, bosses for orange weapons (only to find out all but one were ♥♥♥♥) and playing slot machines before I had weapons that actually packed a decent punch. And that isn't fun. Not to me. I don't so much mind farming if there is something clear to farm for. But since most of the stuff in the game is based on random generation, well, you can't rely on farming one spot for something great. Only bosses are useful for it and it becomes real tedious to have to exit the entire game and start it up again to reset bosses to farm.  ♥♥♥♥ the enemies with physical steel shields. Just ♥♥♥♥ them, on New Game+ the badass variants will consume tons of explosives.  Moxxi stares at you. Like, she 'really' stares at you and it became unsettling for me to turn around from the slot machines to see if she still was gawking at me only to have her lean down on the counter staring right at me.   But yeah, the storyline is fun and interesting and has some nice plot twists. The characters are well-developed and interesting even if two of the previous game's cast are a bit forced into the game. The combat is fun and varied. The art-style is great. Like I said, I enjoyed the game. But it's far easier for me to fixate and go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over annoying and frustrating ♥♥♥♥ than it is for me to delve deeper into good aspects.  Oh and New Game+ seems kinda pointless to me. I mean, once you've played through the story and heard the humour there's nothing left to drive me forward. I already know how the plot is gonna go. I already know of most of the objectives. I already know about the jokes that are coming so they aren't as funny the 2nd time around. So why bother with NG+? To collect more weapons? Yeah, cause that doesn't sounds repetitive and boring. I guess I'll continue on my NG+ (which I left quite quickly after starting it) once I get the DLC's (when they're on sale) so I can enjoy them.",

Mix water, soy sauce, vegetable oil, lemon pepper seasoning, and minced garlic in a deep bowl; add pork chops and marinate in refrigerator at least 2 hours. 2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. 3. Remove pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. 4. Cook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 5. Serve and Enjoy!",

As a Single Player game it's not bad at all, the Story is Great, it's got a good Longevity to it, but the meat of the game is the Loot and the challenge that it offers. The game offers serevall classes and all of them can be modified to your liking, either be a Solo Hunter or a Party Healer and Buffer, it's your choice and the best part is that each class was it's own playstile and not just a simple change of main type of weapons.  The Game engine is well optimized (even with PhysX, it is one of the games that best uses it and with the least impact on performance), and the Online is Great, unlike the first Borderlands, the second one deals much better with your progress in a Single Player Game and your progress with a Co Op Game (let's say you finish a quest in Co Op that you did not even got near in Single Player... when you unlock said quest, or quests, in your Single Player, the game will go 'oh hey! You already done that Online, want to skip that?').  Most of the DLC are worth it but... if you need to choose, as for story driven DLC... Tiny Tinas is the best one!  As for the DLC classes, well... it's a matter of playstile, I can't help you with that, the Mechnonancer is a pet focused class and the Psycho is a Melee class.  Overall, it's a good Single Player game and a Great Co-Op Game, one of the best in that regard.",

Some people really want to like it, but they can't force themselves to. For me, it's a near-perfect game with some extremely frustrating elements.   To break it down into simple terms, I love the art style, the characters, and the satirical direction Gearbox went with it. Claptrap is funny to me, even if he is the JarJar Binks of video games, your silent protagonist is always spoken to directly, but seems to be peripheral to the whole thing. You are, after all meant to be that character.   The special powers are fun and combat is a blast. No matter how many times you die, you can always retry failed missions and just respawn. This is normal, but it's stlil pretty cool in this game because they do give you a penalty for it. You have to pay some money. The more money you have, the more money they take. This is what motivates you to not die, but you will die a lot. Even still, it's a game that Gearbox obviously wants you to win.   My playtime isn't a joke, it's literally 50 hours of me being obsessive. If you have been accurately diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder by a physician, it's probably not the type of game you want to play. My only major complaints are usually the same complaints I have with games - the soundtrack is cool for a little while, but it grows really tired after just an hour or so. Maybe I'm unique in this, but a full soundtrack is maybe 2 hours of music, and I fail to see how Gearbox couldn't afford someone to compose thise considering game music creators are a dime a dozen. If they put real money into that, it's a waste.   However, the voice acting is near-flawless and some of what they say is hilarious, most of it being just chuckleworthy. There are parts that will have you running in circles that make the game feel a bit repetitive, to a degree. But that's not a totally bad thing with Borderlands 2, because you'll always be picking up some neat loot and weapons.   One thing you'll never have to actually buy is weapons, but sometimes the 'daily specials' at the vending machines are pretty good, so make sure you check them out. The mini games and joke missions are also enjoyable, and they cause you to sympathize with some of the characters even while there's a lot of humor behind their destruction or self-loathing.   The DLC thing is divisive. I did buy all the DLC's for content, and I personally think they were worth it.   In short, you'll get out of this game exactly what you put into it. It can take you 8 hours, or it can take you 800 hours. I don't think you'll find any shortage of real gameplay here.   8.5/10",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.  In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.  Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.  Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!  Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.  Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.  Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).  Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!",

            "review_text": "Borderlands 2 has to be one of my all time favorite games. It is affordable (when on sale) and is a lot more fun than many other games on the market. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes video games because of how long you can play it without becoming tired of it, and just because of how fun it really is.  Play with up to 4 friends at any given time as you go through the story mode which is very detailed and has many missions to complete to earn in-game currency, weapons, and exp to level up your charecter to become even stronger than you were before. The fun never ends with 3 game modes, with the loot becoming increasingly better, aswell as the difficulty increasingeach time. The graphics arn't bad for being a couple years old, and the weapons look very cool. There is no thing I really like more than the other in Borderlands 2. The story mode is very fun, earning cool weapons and raiding places for loot is also fun. There is just so much to do, which makes it easy to keep playing without getting bored, especially if you have a short attention span like me.  If you havn't got Borderlands 2 already, you are missing out. You can get it on sale for 5$, or sometimes even cheaper on other sites. If you are going to buy Borderlands 2, I would reccomend buying the GOTY Edition because of all the DLC which makes the game even more fun and interesting, although the game is still very fun without DLC.   *WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD*  The game starts out when you wake up as a vault hunter in the snow with a robot named Claptrap, who will guide you through the game. Vault hunters are very rare, and their mission is to stop Handsome Jack (the main villan in the story). Handsome Jack hates vault hunters and will kill them whenever he has the chance. You soon start to gather some weapons, ammo, a shield, and more. Across the planet of Pandora (the planet everyone is living on) there are Bandits, which will try to kill when when they have the chance. Killing enemys such as bandits will reward you with exp, to help level up your charecter, which will give you more health, and access to more weapons (weapons will require a minimum level to use).The higher level the enemy, the more exp and loot given. Enemys also drops things like weapons too, aswell as health packs to help replenish your health. All around there are chests, some containing better loot than others. These chests contain ammo, guns, health, shields, grenades, certain class mods, relics, and more. Once you start getting better you will face harder enemys, and some bosses here and there. Eventually, you get to Santuary, a town of people who all hate Handsome Jack. You will join the Crimson Raiders, a team trying to take Handsome Jack out. You are assigned to do more missions there. Roland is the leader of the Crimson Raiders. Soon you meet Lilith, Roland's ex, who helps you rescue Roland who has been captured by bandits. Roland and you will become friends, but soon some bad news comes in from Roland's spy, Mordacai. He finds out that Handome Jack has been charging a vault warrior with eridium (an ancient alien rock). This vault warrior will obey its awakener, which Jack hopes to become. If Jack gets ahold of this warrior, he could use it to take anyone who he wanted out, which would be you. In the end, you are about to kill Jack, but before you do, he manages to awaken the warrior. You will have to kill the warrior as your last mission, and let me tell you that is not the easiest thing to do. If you defeat the warrior, you will be able to kill Jack, and save everyone from his evil ways. Once you finish the story mode, you will be able to go to the next mode where you do the story all over again with harder dificulty and better loot.  Overall, Borderlands 2 is too complex of a game to fully cover in one review, but I tried to give you as much information as possible. If you havn't bought Borderlands 2 already, what are you doing? Just buy it. It is worth every penny ;)",

The game you now all know as Borderlands 3 &amp; Knuckles™ has a long history which requires a lot of research to discover.

Your goal is to stop Handsome Jack and the Hyperions from opening the Vault, which is an alien vault containing the Warrior, a god-like alien being. There are many side quests along the way, and the game makes you constantly level up, which is a great thing to do.  Overall, this game is fantastic. Even after you beat the game one time, you can go back and do it AGAIN in True Vault Hunter Mode, where you keep all your weapons and levels, but you start the game over, and the lowest level, is 30.

Story 8/10- It's nothing super complicated but the game does have a decent story, involving the characters you play as in the first game. The best part of the writing in the game really shines through in the humor of it all. No matter what mission you're on the game will find a way to sneak in a joke or two.  Music 5/10- For a good chunk of the game there is no music playing and when it does its kinda boring and not very memorable. There are a few tracks I liked, but for them most part it was boring to listen to.  Overall- If you're looking for a fun FPS that you can play co-op with your friends, or heck random people this game will be right up your ally.",

(shame you can't be here today man R.I.P) This game has A LOT to offer. If you are new player or a fan of the series.

I want to cover the game first on its value to the consumer, which I will rate the vanilla (without DLC) experience vs. the full DLC filled game. I will then explain my own thoughts on both underneath the unbiased value of each respective part.  Borderlands 2 is primarily a shooter, with RPG elements and a Diablo-esque loot system comprised of many types of loot to aquire. It can be played in co-op and has a lot of content to play. It is varied in humor and with gore, but if that doesn't turn you off then continue.  Vanilla Borderlands 2:  Consumer Value: 7/10. Alot of story content and alot of sidequests, not much replayability. Two bosses for end game content isn't that great, but both can put up a decent challenge to someone entering this kind of game for the first time.  My Thoughts: About the same, not much to do once you beat the story. Unless you wanna play through every character and min/max them.  Borderlands 2 GOTY:  Consumer Value: 9.5/10 Alot more content, most of it is worth the players time and can be enjoyable with co-op or without. Tons of End-game bosses to defeat could leave the player more satisfied with their purchase. Includes 2 interesting characters added and a higher level cap to make it a stronger game for those seeking value from their purchase.  My thoughts: Its good, get it already. It can be hard, but thats what friends are for right?  I hope I somewhat helped if you somehow haven't played this and are deciding to buy it.  What, you're still here? I hope you aren't thinking of NOT buying it, as I put SO much effort into a relatively short review. Anyway, buy it already. Diamond ponies and robot dubstep? References out the A**? Ok. Move on... I get it... ",

Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep:By far my favorite DLC,play through the tale of fantasy in a dungeons and dragons based medieval DLC campaign told by Tiny Tina.  Mr.Torgue's Campaign of Carnage:If you like explosions,muscles and outall manliness this DLC is for you :D.Enter the BADASS tournament to open the vault in the Badass Crater of Badassitude  Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt:Ok this one is controversial but f**k it.Join Sir Hammerlock on his adventure through the savage jungles of Pandora and go head to head with Professor Nakayama trying to take the place of Handsome Jack.  Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Bootey:Arrr maties!Set sail on an exciting journey,swashbuckling and loot!The beautiful scenary and levels,a pretty good (...controversial and overbloated) storyline to find Captain Blade's treasure.What are you waiting for landlubbers?  AND SO MANY HEADHUNTER PACKS! :D  No other game deserves the title Game of The Year more than Borderlands 2.It is my definetly and no other competitors just downright FAVORITE GAME OF THEM ALL :D.The game is so entertaining huge and just begs you to go exploring,encountering new foes and friends,guns and much much more!I recommend this game with all my heart and joy.Buy this game RIGHT NOW no questions asked :)",

Absolutely by my vote, 10/10 I would pay for full price, i bought it for me and my girlfriend we had the time of our lives, if you dont want to play alone in the story then pick it up with a friend because it is worth it!",

It may be a RAM hog at 1.1 to 1.4 gigabytes of memory used during runtime, but if you've got the machine, you need, and I mean NEED, to give this game a try. As well as its prequel.  What does the story entail? Well ♥♥♥♥ that, I'm not gonna tell you! Just know that it's full of plot twists, references to the last game, and still has so much new stuff to keep players both new to the series, and vets, entertained for hours.  Also, let's not forget the replayability, and raid bosses. ♥♥♥♥ing raid bosses.    Good luck getting Legendary items into all your slots; the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are rare, but COMPLETELY worth it!  Rating: 9/10, because too many people say it's 10/10, and honestly, it is home to its own set of glitches. But what game isn't? This game, for what it is, is absolute perfection, and you should add it to your library and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.  Good hunting!  Recommend: VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY YES. With all the DLC excluding the costume packs (get 'em if you want, it's more money to Gearbox Studios!)",

Heck, you may not even like FPS, or be good at it, but if you play with friends, you can still have hell of a great time!  ++ +The story is great  +The characters are huge dorks. You\\'re gonna end up loving all of them whether you like it or not. +The gameplay is fluid and simple +The style is visually appealing. Gearbox has done an awesome good job with the visual design! +The DLCs are super fun too (Mr. Torgue\\'s badass arena of badassitude is my favorite)  +This game is the first FPS where I tried the public matchmaking, and literally everyone I was paired with was super nice. I even made some new friends. But maybe that\\'s just me...I hope not. +Totally worth the full price! But hey, get it on sale if you can. It\\'s 4 years old already anyway...  -- -Since late 2014 BL2 has become pretty unstable. I noticed everything was fine until DirectX 10 settled for good. And then...Windows 10. I know I\\'m not the only one in this situation. Some people with older specs (and Windows 7 or XP) can still play just fine though!  -Don\\'t play it in french. Just don\\'t. Trust me.  On a side note, I suggest you start with Borderlands 1, though I hear you have to use Hamachi or something similar to play with people now, because the game is...well, getting old.

However, nothing's perfect.  The gun-play is good but nothing amazing. The way enemies are turned into bullet sponges during coop is plain lazy design on the developer's part. The way loot drops is absolutely terrible in coop so if nobody loves you and for some reason you want to play with randoms, plan to race for loot.  There's plenty of extra dynamics and depth they could have added to this game but when you get down to it, this game feels like a mostly blank canvas with hints of a masterpiece scattered across it.  Simply, I lost interest after 36 hours a couple months ago. Humor alone can't justify playing a game that goes on for this long. I'll still recomend this game but only with the assumption you're either not a cynical ♥♥♥♥ like myself or actually have friends.",

Now lets get into the real review here:  Pros:  Super fun first couple of days/weeks/months/years If your friends play this game it is the most fun game to play EVER nice graphics, funny gameplay and awesome characters Runs SOOO smoothly.. its insane  Cons:  Will take up all your day to play this game (You will get addicted) After you buy all of the dlc and complete everything (DLC and regular) it gets boring No friends = No fun If you play random co-op they will ninjaloot every single piece of rare items People will kick you for being nice to them, and or just trying to play with someone Alot of people back in the day modded BL2, so now they are max level and have everything if you get into a game with a modder/hacker you will have a bad time TRUST ME  There is alot of other cons but the game is worth it, IF and i cant stress this enough IF you are new to this series then what are you waiting for? try out the game and if you dont like it.. get a refund. Its a simplistic game with alot of features and overall an amazing game with stunning gameplay  my rating are the following:  Gameplay (First couple of months) 10/10 Characters 10/10 Graphics 8/10 Optimization 9/10 DLC 11/10 best DLC you will ever get  Amazing game overall 9/10 score for me.",

The eclectic cast of characters that populate Pandora, the phenomenal (and often hilarious) writing and voice acting that bring it all to life, the vibrant art style, varied enemy types, rock-solid shooting mechanics and endless pursuit of the best gear possible make Borderlands 2 my absolute favorite game of the past 10 years, and that's coming from someone who's generally not real big on shooters.

I had this game on PS3, before I joined the master race, and I put 200 hours, at least, into the game. And even now I still play it from time to time. Yes, it is true that the game is much more enjoyable with friends: but even then I still find a blast to play solo. The writing in this game is gorgeous and unfortunatly its bogged down by a pretty basic RPG system and a VERY repetitive combat flow. This is definitely worth a buy, on sale or not.

Perhaps it's the well written story, full of jokes and interesting lore, and able to go from funny to serious at a moment's notice. Perhaps it's the different classes, with their own playstyles and diverse skill trees. From Axton the Commando, with his Turrets and focus on assault rifles. Or Zer0 the assassin, who wields invisibility and melee. Maybe it's the extremely diverse range of enemies and characters. Including insane bandits, wild alien creatures and murderous robots with selectively destructible limbs. Almost all of which are very satisfying to fight, sending damage numbers flying into the air. It could just be how fun it is to share the experience with friends, with the singleplayer experience still remaining just as fun on its own. Or it's quite possible it's just Handsome Jack. The best Villain I've seen in a game or movie.  Either way, Borderlands 2 is an extremely fun First Person Shooter. Numerous side quests will keep you busy long before you get near the end of the main story, and all the DLC (all included in a single purchase of the GOTY edition) extends this even further. Even Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt, considered the weakest offering, presents you with a completely different environment and a few new enemies. The endgame content, with several highly difficult raid bosses to fight, Badass Challenges to complete and The Raid on Digistruct Peak as the ultimate goal. Once you've beaten all that, you can do it all again in True, then Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, with enemies scaling to and above your current level. While this may sound repetitive and boring, it somehow isn't. I've played through the game fully on both Console and PC around 4 times, yet I'm still enjoying myself just as much. The story is the same each time, but at the same time you'll be learning to play differently with new characters, finding better loot for your current character or adjusting your skill build, which manages to still keep things fresh (And the permanent bonuses from Badass ranks make the starting sequences that little bit easier each playthrough).  The game is criticised for its high amount of DLC, but the majority of it is just purely cosmetic items. Aside from those, the four story DLCs are all entertaining, with Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep being one of the best experiences in the game. The Headhunter DLCs, while not as long or as high quality as the main expansions still manage to entertain for a while, and The Raid on Digistruct Peak gives you an end goal to work to. All DLC, excluding the cosmetic packs, are included in the Game of the Year edition, which drops to nearly £4 every sale at this point. In fact, the entire borderlands collection drops to less than £10 every time too. For a price like that for so much content, there is no reason why you shouldn't give Borderlands 2 a try.",

I've played this for 80 hours, and i'm only half way to beating this game completely (Theres 3 modes, normal, true vault hunter, and ultimate vault hunter. You unlock them by beating the game on the difficulty below it) The guns can be varied greatly when it comes to legendaries, and there are tons of side-quests to do. Now, this game isn't the greatest when played alone. One con about it is that this game was basically made to be played with friends. Also, this type of gameplay may not appeal to everyone, theres a bit of grinding to get good guns. But, the interesting art style and amazingly varied enemies make this game such a blast. I'd recommend this game to basically all my friends.  9/10  (Is this biased? I don't know :P)",

The only downside is that to truly max out your character, Overpower levels aside, you're going to have to play the main campaign 3 times per character as each of the 3 play modes have a level cap, which can start to feel boring.  The DLCs offer a lot of additional content, however they're not as massive as the ones from Borderlands, and some of them (Like Hammerlock's Hunt) are ones you just want to get through as quickly as possible, so don't expect them to take a long time to complete.  The game has its share of bugs and glitches, but most of them are minor and don't effect your gameplay.   Also, taking this game to open-to-all online co-op is risky, as people hacking the game (or even your character) is a major issue. So it's safer to co-op with people you know, but the game is still a lot more fun with a full squad of players, even if you can do everything solo.",

The game itself is a blend of FPS and RPG elements that balance the two together without making the gameplay feel awkward. As with most RPG systems you steadily increase the level of your Vault Hunter and gain access to talent tree builds that change up the many ways you can approach combat in this game. The FPS element adds another depth of variety on how you handle encounters with its many ranged weapons. (pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, sub machine guns, etc) The system is very good at complimenting the pace and tactics that the player enjoys using. Charge in shoot everything in the face with a shotgun or perform stealthy sniper headshots from complete safety its up to you. Harder difficulties after completetion add decent replay value and improved weapons and loot for those that want more along with extra DLC classes and content. Pros - Fluid and smooth controls, plenty of player choice, multiplayer with friends, and memorable characters (TINY TINA!!!) and probably one of the best lead villians I have seen in a game in a long time. CONS- Can feel repetitive on consecutive playthroughs, a good friend of mine completed the first Borderlands and found it to be much of the same and similar individuals will probably not enjoy it as much as I did since it was my first introduction to the series. 8.5-9/10 Gameplay this smooth is always a plus even if it closely mirrors its origins.",

Of course the pleasure is when you get your hands in one of the legendary weapons.  The RPG element keeps you and allows to play it more than once.",

In the game, you are required to do MISSIONS. There are STORY MISSIONS, and OPTIONAL MISSIONS. the optional ones is, of course, optional.  At the start of the the game you can choose 1 of the 4 characters such as THE COMMANDO, THE SIREN, THE GUNZERKER and of course, THE ASSASSIN. All them are very intresting characters with different skills, playstyles and many more. They also have different intresting backstories too.  Unlike Borderlands, the graphics is better. It is more soothing to the eye. An its AI guide, Angel is more beautiful than the older one.  I shoudn't say too much, because it might spoil the story. Anyways, this game is perfect for people who loves FPS story games which involves KILLING.   ",

What made me stop playing it boils down to three points. First off, the unbalanced difficulty. I'm basically breezing through the game with little to no effort. Shields rarely gets depleted. Then suddenly a bossfight that totally steamrolls you. After a multitude of tries and lots of swearing (in my case) you finally manage to finish him/it/her off and you're back to EZ mode.  Secondly, timed delivery missions. Why put those in a shooter? Seriously.  And thirdly; it's too long. At least in my opinion. I typically prefer my games to last about 15-20 hours. Not 40. I have other games I want to play too. But hey, that's just me.  Solid game, but I didn't finish before going tired and frustrated.",

The graphics are great, there's hours of gameplay, a lot of DLC packs (if you want more content), lots &amp; lots &amp; lots of guns (there's even a gun that shoots exploding swords, you can find it while you're enjoying the extra content from the DLC pack 'Tiny Tina's Assault On Dragon Keep'). In addition to that there's suicidal pyschos, even an obese cannibalistic mother! So I don't wind up writing a 15 page long review, I'll just say this: Choose Borderlands 2 if you're looking for a game with a TON of weapons, enemies and content.",

            "review_text": "Okay, so Borderlands 2 is a FPSRPG game developed by Gearbox. In this game, GUNS. Its GUNS GUNS GUNS GUNS GUNS. Seriously, its all about the guns. Guns are really important in the Borderlands series. You find guns in chests or quests or perhaps EVEN A PILE OF VOMIT (I'm serious). Also, you can LvL up until 50 (61, if you have the DLC that raises your level, LvL 72 if you also bought the other DLC) You have 4 classes here.  Gunzerker (Salvador) Action Skill: Dual-wielding guns/Gunzerking. (Resembles Brick in 1st game)  Siren (Maya) Action Skill: Phaselocking/Trappin' baddies in a ball. (Resembles Lilith in the 1st game)  Commando (Axton) Action Skill: Deploying a Turret (Resembles Roland in the 1st game)  Assassin (Zer0, he's my personal favorite) Action Skill: Activating Decepti0n (Meaning he becomes invisible and his Gun Damage and his Melee Damage increase) (Resembles Mordecai in the 1st game)  There are also DLC charcters which currently are 2 as of May 18, 2013. (There might be new classes in the future)  Mechromancer (Gaige) Action Skill: Deploying Deathtrap, a robot. (Dosen't resemble anyone cause there were no DLC charcters in Borderlands 1)  Psycho (Krieg) Action Skill: Going into a rampage where you can either swing your buzz axe or throw it, which is pretty cool. Aside from that, very humorous one-liners. (As I said, no DLC characters in the 1st game)  Overall Statistics:  Gameplay: 10/10: Nice work on the gameplay, Gearbox, here have a chocolate chip cookie.  Arsenel: 10/10: Estimate of over 87 billion possible guns  Co-op: 9/10: We need sharing of loot, please. Still pretty good though.  Characters: 10/10: Psychos recite Hamlet, Handsome Jack is a pretty cool villain, and the 6 classes have a pretty funny dialogue, especially Krieg.  Story: 9.5/10: Great story, nothing to say here  DLC's: 9/10: The Captain Scarlett DLC is for loot, The Torgue Campaign DLC has a very funny dialogue, Tiny Tina's DLC created its raid bosses with great design, Hammerlock is probably my least favorite.  Art Style: 10/10: The cartoonish feel for the Borderlands is fitting.  Classes: 10/10: 6 badass classes who save Pandora, nothing else. Also you have skill trees (which upgrade your Action Skill, entire self, etc) which you can manipulate to fit your style of playing this awesome game.  Humor: 10/10: Oh my god if you don't think Borderlands 2's humor is hilarious, I will come to your house, and have a serious talk with you, mister.  Overall: 9.5/10   To conclude, its an exemplary game, with alot of weapons, cool characters and the co-op is nice as well.  See ya next time guy-who-is-reading-this-review. - Guns",

This game even mocked it's predecessor for having a bad ending, but in my oppinion it didn't do a much better job itself. But hell what does that matter anyway with a game as awesome as this. And no it is not awesome in the meaning that it will inspire speechlessness on you, but in the modern meaning that IT'S-COMPLETELY-BONKERS-AWESOME. I love this game as much as I loved the first one. The sequel improved on gunplay, movement, car-handling, storrytelling, character customisation and all the other stuff. It did however manmage to botch up the menus even worse than the first game, and they are clearly optimised with controller in mind, and doesn't even work with mouse half the time. Don't expect anything clever with this game, as it isn't. Instead it is a fun shooter with fun mechanics, a bit bulletspongy, but I managed to get around that by using more stonky weapons such as snipers. As mentioned before I really like this game, but it is not without flaws and nowhere near a perfect game. One of my favourite things about it is the artstyle, wich pretty much keeps itself true to the first one, but I absolutely love the cartoonish style, and the nice drawn textures.  I can really reccomend this game if you like brainless fun, but beware of bullet-spongy-ness, and a f*cking annoying CL4P-TP. Seriously he's so annoying -.-",

The story is way better than the original borderlands storyline(if you could call it a story). The visuals carry on the unique style and it looks great. The environments vary from snowy tundras to exotic deserts to lands filled with molten lava. I definetely recommed this game. I would also recommend picking up Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, it is an excellent example of how DLC should be done, it adds a crap ton of content, new storyline, and brings back those culture references that Borderlands 2 is so known for.  game is 9/10 in my eyes.",

Buying decent weapons from the machine never happens where in borderlands you occaisionally found something you needed. BL2 doesn't feel as well balanced as borderlands.

At least, the 'powerful' enemies should. I don't consider giving an enemy WAY too much health a threat or a good form of drama to make me feel that it's important. I feel it's wasting my time. Make exceptionally powerful enemies a challenge in more ways than tons of health.  Otherwise, the game is great all around. Definitely worth playing through alone. ABSOLUTELY worth playing through with friends (full party of 4). I would suggest NOT playing new game + or new game ++ (known as 'true vault hunter mode' and 'ultimate vault hunter mode', respectively). Just play through the first run then do it again with a different character while doing all the DLC you've bothered to get (preferably both run throughs with friends). New game+ modes just make the high-health problem even more prevalent for enemies. It's annoying and adds nothing to the game imo.  Recommended fun with friends.",

There's a bajillion and one guns (seriously, you'll spend a lot of time just selling old guns, and you'll never keep any one gun for too long). Just play this, OK! Shoot things in the face, take their stuff and have fun with it!",

The game is considerably harder - enemies now scale to your level much more often than in the original game, leveling up is considerably harder and money drop has been DRASTICALLY reduced (prices were balanced, too). Newcomers will love it and veterans will have an excellent time. Worth every cent. DEFINITELY recommend.",

A game that can't stand alone without the help of being enjoyed with friends comes as a weakness in design. I could have fun with my friends doing things none of us enjoy solely based on the fact we're suffering together.

The good news is that all content is available in the normal mode(the easiest version) so you aren't missing out on anything. Just remember that with the level dispersion that you may never find anyone to play with.

Eventually, you reconvene the four orignal Vault Hunters and go on a search for 'Angel' who seems like some sort of AI.  You end up attack Jack's base and you live happily ever after, depending on what ending you chose.  Graphics- 6, They are made a certain way, on purpose, not the best, but not the worst graphics.   Story- 8, The story isn't deep, but the acting and basic plot are good, the characters, though, are deep.   Gameplay- 10, I could spend enless hours just shooting stuff up with all the crazy guns and other wacked out stuff they have.   Mechanics- 7, The controls are sound, and they're aren't as many crazy glitches like its predecessor, it is like any other FPS on the PC.   Replay Value- 8 with exception, With all the DLC and blasting with friends, this game has plenty of replay value, but if you are alone, it does not have that much appeal.  Overall: 7.8, This game is definitely a blockbuster. Worth every penny for the hours of fun that you will get from this.",

Graphics are astonishing, if you like the style. Same goes for the humour, nothing can compete with Clap-Trap's jokes. It is very much the same formula that in the first game, with little additions but still tons of fun. I paid more attention to the storyline than in the first title though, no idea why. After a while, I was just spending lots of in-game time looking for Vault Symbols. And hidden challenges. And good loots. Comparison menus were irritating from time to time. Loots were also a bit disappointing after a while, and missing some progression there drove me away for Pandora. Maybe I wasn't lucky enough. Maybe I'll resume the vault hunting one day. And help Clap-Trap once again.",

An expert blend of RPG/Shooter that provides unlimited hours of fun. I'm not going to go over the synopsis or description because its pointless at this time. What I will talk about is why I recommend this game. I love Borderlands is because I usually avoid multiplayer centric games. Like Call of Duty, Battlefield etc. Nothing wrong with them but they just not appeal to me. Not to mention the fact that their Single Player campaign is nothing but a training mode for MP. Borderlands actually have a personality, it stands out among the countless SciFi/Military shooters. It has a crass personality and a wicked sense of humor. Not to mention the fact that it provides hour upon worth of gameplay. With different player classes, it always makes you want to try experimenting with different characters. However, I do think that the story could use a better writer to make it more cohesive, not just a bunch of missions loosely woven together. Besides that and some rather annoynig time centric side missions, it is a terrific game. I hiughly recommend it to people who are sick and tired of the likes of CoD or Battlefields of modern shooters.",

I love the art, characters, dialogue, banter, jokes...I mean I love it all. I did....until UVHM came along and ruined the game totally. Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode...at the time I quit playing, was the top difficulty setting to play on and to do this youd play through normal all the way through again and again until you hit the difficult playthrough UHVM. Whats wrong with playing through a few hundred missions a few times? Nothing as long as the gameplay allows you to feel a sense of power. As you progress the weapons scale with you and enemy life bars scale a bit faster until the last playthrough where it takes more ammo than you have on your person to take down a simple mob and bosses are reduced to a high pressure grind fest. In BL1 you feel that sense of power. You feel strong when you attack a group of bad guys. You feel like the comic book, John Woo styled hero, just blazing away at the baddies. There was a sense of danger and a sense of heroism as you battled on through hordes of monsters and midgets. In BL2 when you get to the fabled UVHM, which is forced upon you as you purchase a DLC, you dont feel heroic. You feel like a victim. Pushed into a corner as you constantly die. Enemies resisting your attacks on an elemental AND physical level. The game forces a particular style of play. Slagging! Allow me to introduce to you the element known as Slag. Its the element pretty much ignored for lack of importance on the first few playthroughs. Slag increases damage. Thats it. Its a mechanic that you use to basically manage damage on powerful enemies. It also wears off every few seconds so you have to re Slag an enemy every few seconds. Couple this with a horde of overpowered 'bad asses' and you get a dysfunctional damage management game instead of a shooting party. This is every encounter during the last mode of play. Enemy appears. You get tagged with a shot. Shields down. Slag shots. Enemy slagged. Switch to gun of choice. Blast a few rounds. Enemy becomes resiliant. Switch back. Hit 'Special' and hope it regens health because most likely youre low on health at this point. Slag...bam bam bam...switch...Slag...bam bam dead. One baddie down. Rinse and repeat for another 12 thousand enemies of increasing difficulty to go. Couple that with a few other issues like lack of gun variety, lacluster 'cover', worthless skills as a point sink, and TONS of crap items flying out of every badguy you can hit. I still recommend this game for ONE thing. Dont get the all the DLC if you DO buy this game. Get this game and really play the heck out of the story the first time and on the second playthrough go through the DLC as released in order. Its worth every penny to one time it. After that however....I just got sick of it after a while. The fighting at higher levels is just a huge unbalanced slaughter.",

Moments of humor, sometimes subtle and sometimes very crude, add to the overall enjoyment. Fast-paced action is nice, and combat feels suitably frenetic. Four (six with DLC) classes add to the replay factor, as does the plethora of add-on DLCs if you like what you got.  The Bad: Reliance on the random drop system means there is no difficulty curve, just random zig-zagging based on whether you've found a gun recently that matches your spec, play style and the type of enemy you're fighting. Occasionally droughts of good weapons mean the game becomes frustratingly difficult. On top of that difficulty, having an underpowered weapon means you burn through ammo frustratingly quickly, reducing your glorious charge through an enemy stronghold into a SMG clip scavenger hunt, or a back-track race to avoid respawns. The story doesn't give you a strong reason to keep going, and amount of back-tracking and just running through areas you no longer care about can get tedious.  The Bottom Line: Combining the worst parts of MMOs (the grinding, the struggle to find relevant loot, the vast amounts of walking) with the worst parts of RPGs (arbitrarily area level gating through enemy difficulty, fetch quests) on top of a workable but badly-balanced FPS, I really can't recommend this game at full price. I got it as a gift and I felt it was a waste of my time. In short doses it's fun but the grind and erratic difficulty are too much to put up with for a story not compelling enough to get me to keep going.  You'd like this if you like: If you thought that grinding your T0 gear set was the best part of vanilla World of Warcraft.

But when every weapon I've ever found (that wasn't a sniper rifle) requires a full clip to kill enemies, even after going through every other possible sidequest beforehand to level up and try to find something other than the pantload of white guns that I always ended up with... well, I found myself angry.  With Borderlands 1, there were a lot of issues that proved annoying, but they were worth working through or ignoring in order to get to the fun part - a variety of powerful guns that allow tons of interesting options, and the excitement about uncovering them just before opening that chest, or killing that Badass. You'd think a sequel would increase the variety that was offered, but the loot system feels gutted - manufacturers now have a gimmick that they cannot stray from, rather than a tendency towards certain effects/stat combinations. This, combined with how rare it was to get anything other than trash, meant that finding the kind of gun that I wanted, which also did any noticeable level of damage, was like finding a needle in a haystack. But whereas in Borderlands 1, you'd be noticing all kinds of interesting needles along the way, in Borderlands 2, it was like the whole thing was needles, except they were all infected.

Since (I double checked) the store page does NOT mention this known issue they will not get a good review from me, even though I can tell i would like this game.   Why is it so hard for these gold digging asshat companys to patch known faulty code? It should be considered false advertisement to sell known fault programming as I did not get what I paid for, and I have a system well prepared for such a game. Therefore they have not provided what my purchase entailed. A WORKING GAME.   So sick of companys using us then just moving on expecting us to forgive and forget. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that.

Holiday DLCs are lame, campaign DLCs got boring once it was just reskins of enemies. Pirate's Booty was the only good DLC and had rad music, good enemies and good story.  Loot in this game is not rewarding, as time after time I've been given truckloads of green and blue weapons with a sparse sprinkling of purple and once a year an orange if I'm lucky or if I pay with Badass tokens which forces you to play the same Torgue missions over and over. I've played this game longer than any of my friends who own it and they manage to somehow get amazing loot.   Game saves do not transfer platforms, as I found out after playing my Siren for three years on a mac, then building my own PC to find that no Siren was on my save list.   Anthony Burch is a terrible writer and needs to be publicly executed, no joke.  I have zero drive to play this game. The only redeeming factor is the ability to play with friends which makes the gameplay drastically better of course, but all of my friends find this game to be trash as well as I do.",

I'm not a huge fan of fetch quests and other than a few firearms with some interesting mechanics, I'm not to thrilled by the shooting, so there's a lot I don't like there. The game's enemies are either 'guy that runs at you and blows up,' 'guy that runs at you and hits you a lot' or 'guy that shoots you and maybe makes you explode' and all of them take about five hundred more bullets than they should, so that's out. So what's this review about?  I like one character in this game, even ironically, and that is Krieg. I like him more for his /italics/ video trailer /enditalics/ and his abilities than I do the whole of the rest of the game's characters. They're not funny or interesting and they're annoying for exactly all of the wrong reasons. Imagine Claptrap from Borderlands 1 was copy pasted onto every other character in the game, but now he has some terrible accents to break up the extremely unfunny dialogue's monotony.  You wanna know why I like Krieg? He's got /italics/ potential /enditalics/ to be interesting. I mean he is the sole guy on the planet that has a conscience (and don't tell me any of the other main characters have anything remotely resembling a consicence). He's got a tortured inner self that has to look on at atrocities he commits in abject horror and shame and can do almost nothing about it. It's a small part of him, but it could highlight just how messed up everyone else is in your party that there likely is no inner dialogue. He's literally a stark raving madman and that small part of him is probably more sane than the person playing the game.  Does this show up in the game at all?  Of course not! Can't get in the way of shooting and fetch questing! No need for this supposed RPG to focus on it's supposed characters that are supposedly advancing some kind of plot! That and more lines for Claptrap, our favorite and most beloved character! And involvement of characters from the first game, who now have voices and their own 'plots' and 'interesting' things to say!  There might be redeeming qualities about this game somewhere, but I guess I don't see them. Other than Krieg. And not even Krieg, his /italics/ potential /enditalics/.  Oh wait, there's one: I guess if you're playing this you're not going out and committing actual atrocities. So yay! 'Borderlands 2: Virtual Violence So You Can't Commit Actual Violence' should just be on the box from now on.",

Watching paint dry is fun with friends as well, that doesn't make it good.   The gunplay is typical modern FPS with a mixture of hitscan and projectile weaponry that rely on the use of iron sights to be effective, however the gunplay itself is only mediocre. It is not what makes Borderlands 2 the irredeemable turd that it is.  The visuals are awful, they use a cheap, ugly cel shading trick in an attempt to hide the hideous textures and low poly environments. Speaking of which, all the environments are just empty areas with no thought or care put into their design and traversing them is a boring chore.  The 'gorillion' guns in Borderlands 2 are just a few assets for each manufacturer randomly generated together with marginal stat differences. There is no respect for how guns actually work and are wholly impractical and ridiculous in design.    The menus take the form over function approach and are annoying to navigate and difficult to read at times because they're stylised way too much.   The RPG elements of the game are terrible as well. There is horrendous HP bloat especially at higher levels where the damage and health levels keep rising to ridiculous levels which has the knock on effect of making that gun that you really love worthless after a while and you have to throw it away and get something else not as good just to do damage to enemies. There are different classes in the game in an attempt to diversify gameplay which boils down to every few minutes getting to use their special ability for a few seconds and then it's back to the same old repetive monotony that is this game. Of course it also has the obligatory skill tree which allows you to upgrade arbitrary abilities unique to each character that have minimal effect on the gameplay.  Then there's the writing. Oh, God the writing. Everything is wrong here. Most of the lines and dialogue stem from the 'LOL SO RANDUMB XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD LE REDDIT MEMES BADASS SO BADASS XDDDDDDDDD' school of thought with a bit of the trademark Anthony '&gt;tfw no Wii U' Burch forced social justice agenda in there as well. The dialogue and voice acting is always loud, obnoxious and in your face but it isn't funny, it's just annoying and comes off as trying way too hard. Also, the word 'Badass' is so overused it makes 5 year old ♥♥♥♥♥ memes seem fresh in comparison.  Borderlands 2 is worthless garbage and you should never play it.

            "review_text": "As you may have guessed from the title, there’s not much new to uncover in the sequel to Borderlands: it has lots of guns, some goofy characters that have returned from the previous game, and a lot of respawning. If you thought all of that was great the first time around, you’ll love this one. If you were lukewarm to all of it, as I was, you won’t necessarily be impressed by what’s fundamentally a retread of the major elements of the first game with a few minor enhancements.  Borderlands 2 picks up several years after the end of the first title: the Vault is open, the Hyperion Corporation wants its treasure and the intrepid heroes from the first game have been waging war against the engineers and robots of Hyperion to ensure that the CEO, Handsome Jack, does not get his hands on it. Borderlands spoiler alert: the end of Borderlands, where you open the Vault everyone’s been after and find essentially nothing, was a terrible conclusion, like Randy Pitchford personally giving you the finger as a reward for finishing his game. As a result, Borderlands 2 spares no opportunity to remind the player that the end of the first game was indeed a substantial letdown. It’s one of those instances of self-referential humor that doesn’t work very well in the game.  Graphically, nothing has really changed about the game, but the original was a very distinctive and handsome game relying on a hybrid cel-shaded 3-D artwork style. The mechanics are very similar to the original: this is basically an FPS with some customization elements. Borderlands 2 has four new characters to choose from, two of which are essentially copied from the first game with some revisions, and two others, the Gunzerker and the Assassin, are unique. There are also some DLC characters available, the Mechromancer (a bit like the Soldier in the first game, but with a pet robot instead of a turret)and the Psycho (a bit like the Berzerker in the first game, a melee-focussed character). Each character has a skill tree that you can plug points into as you level up and, unlike in the first game, there are no real penalties for a specific character to favor one type of weapon over another.  As in the first game, you will need to complete at least some of the available side missions in order not to be too underlevelled for the story content, which does not level with you. On the other hand (so I’ve been advised), if you complete a majority of the available side missions as some Pandoraholics do, you will find your character rapidly overlevels the story content. The new game comes with all of the same flaws (or quirks, if you prefer) that the old one did: a bizarre checkpoint save system that doesn’t even save at a specific checkpoint per se but saves your progress and links it to a specific location on a map; a bizarre fast-travel system that lets you revisit any place you’ve been before but only if you’re actually at a “fast-travel” station; spawnable vehicles that steer using the mouse; and lots of gratuitous deaths. Most of these mechanics feel like they were taken from every console game ever, which makes Gearbox’s decision to retain all of them in the new game’s PC version all the more peculiar.  I will give Borderlands 2 this much: it’s slightly more entertaining than it is aggravating most of the time. Given that, I was able to finish the story in about 30 hours, although there were several hair-tearing boss battles that made me want to quit. However, I will reiterate that this isn’t a very good single-player game. It’s designed for multiplayer and it shows. The entire game appears to be poorly-balanced for a single player who is very close to or on level, although I will concede that it’s possible that I’m just extremely bad at this type of game. After all, I completed my playthrough with the Mechromancer DLC character, who I have been told is an “easy mode” PC.  I played through the Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep DLC in about eight hours. There are also some frustrating parts to this story, including some unwelcome platforming elements and annoying boss battles. The narrative is Gearbox’s homage to (or perhaps mockery of) a variety of RPG (both computer and tabletop) conventions and tropes wrapped around Tiny Tina’s acceptance of an event in the main game. While my feeling is that this isn’t really worth the full asking price, I would recommend it if you like Borderlands and role-playing games at all. The pop-culture and RPG references are pretty funny, although the inclusion of tedious switch-flipping and platform-jumping puzzles, even if they are mostly skippable, as references to other games’ overreliance on these mechanics is another case of Gearbox trying to be funny that falls flat. Fortunately the story justifies the more groan-inducing aspects of the gameplay in the case of this DLC, with a genuinely-moving ending that, in typical Borderlands fashion, turns on a dime back to “Let’s go blow some s*@! up!”",

        {
            "review_text": "Let me tell you up front; this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess.  Let's start with the worst of it all, the writing. The plot revolves around taking down the CEO of the Hyperion Corporation, Handsome Jack, because you're vault hunters and he doesn't want you to find the vault. Now, keep in mind, the story doesn't actually involve YOU. In fact, the player characters are rarely, if ever even mentioned or directly referred to. The player is sometimes addressed in ECHO calls and cutscenes, but seldom will you feel that your efforts actually matter.   No, the real heroes of this game are... well, the heroes of the last game. I could dedicate an entire review to talking about how horribly written, unfaithfully portrayed, and hamfisted the previous Vault Hunters are, but that would take too much time. Basically, they're all annoying pieces of trash that only exist to take any and all enjoyment out of your experience with the game. Roland is your generic leader figure who can disarm a robot with his bare hands but can't remember to wear a ♥♥♥♥ing shield on a planet where shields are common items and are established as things that everyone has. Lilith is your generic 'badass chick' who in one scene can't even teleport the player characters twenty feet but then mere hours later has no trouble teleporting an entire city halfway across the continent, and is also an incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥ who acts as a plot device against all warnings. Mordecai is your generic alcoholic whose character is based entirely on jokes and failed delivery. Brick is the worst of the bunch, the generic energetic bruiser type who can brutally mutilate fifty guys with his bare hands in less than an hour but falls to his knees and cries at the mention of a hurt puppy, and the game will not stop bashing you over the head with his presence once he's introduced to the plot. On top of that, it tries to treat their adventure from the last game as if it were some epic immortalized in the history of Pandora, and not just a matter of a bunch of thieves running around in a desert for forty hours before fighting a giant tentacle monster.  The plot is just a load of garbage. I mean this from the bottom of my heart, it is complete and utter nonsense. Literally, an 8th grader trying his hand at fanfiction can do better than this tripe. It's riddled with plot holes, melodrama, and padding. It starts out as this light-hearted, campy shooter, and then attempts to have emotional impact and get the player involved, as if it were this deep, enthralling story. It then trips over itself trying to force more jokes into the mix while simultaneously being unable to remember that the player has absolutely no attachment to any of these characters, has no reason to form an attachment, and is probably fuming from the fact that they have to trudge through yet another sidequest padded, unnecessarily large area. The plot has poor timing, doesn't compensate for the fact that the game doesn't have a set pacing, and tries to treat its main story like it's in any way engaging and not only being completed so that there are more areas to farm for loot. The plotline with Handsome Jack is somewhat redeeming... for the first ten minutes, and then it faceplants into a ditch, contradicting itself literally around every corner. If anything, it's obvious that the game is hinging itself entirely on the humor. There are some genuinely funny parts of the game, both in scenery and in spoken dialogue -- it's just that you'll have to dig between the piles of year-old internet memes and ancient slapstick to find them.   Now let's talk about the somewhat bearable part of the game. The shooting mechanics are generally what you'd expect if you've played any first person shooter made within the past six years. The controls are responsive and movement is very fluid, although you'll quickly find that you move just as slow in this game as you do in practically every other modern shooter. They attempt to subvert this by letting you jump very high, but your actual walking motion will start to feel very, VERY slow, especially in areas where, for some reason, vehicles aren't included. There are four different character classes (six with DLC) that all function somewhat differently. They each have their own action skill, and Gearbox at the very least did a decent job of balancing their capabilities (as far as I could tell, anyway.) Beyond that, your skills all revolve around passive damage bonuses, enhanced combat abilities (such as throwing grenades in fight for your life or being able to run faster after a kill) and upgrades to your action skill.  I'd like to dedicate a paragraph to talking about how utterly broken the 'Fight For Your Life' system is with regards to how often you'll be stuck in it because of the enemies' perfect accuracy and nonsensical damage scaling, but this might have more to do with the fact that I played in a stack of four players, and that I'm probably not that great at the game. Be wary of higher levels, however, where enemies will take dozens of shots to kill while being capable of destroying your entire shield and half your health with a single bullet. Something in me feels that the game is balanced toward you, the player, dying in every single enemy encounter, considering the sheer number of skills each class has dedicated to enhancing your fight-for-your-life capabilities.  As far as loot goes, there's not much to say. Gear has varying rarities that may or may not accurately reflect how good the gear actually is. There are dozens and dozens of randomly generated components, both on the visual aspect of the guns, as well as their mechanics. There are some guarantees, such as each brand's special quirks (Dahl weapons burst fire when zoomed, Tediores can be thrown like grenades, Hyperion gets more accurate as you fire, etc.), and then there are some random components, such as weapon accuracy, reload speed, fire rate, magazine size, and damage. I wouldn't say that no two guns are alike, but there's enough variety in terms of randomization to ensure that it'll be a rare occurence if you ever do find the exact same weapon twice. My only complaint with this system is that in order to find the really rare guns (read: the only ones that are worth a damn past level 40), you pretty much have to farm bosses. This process is rather painless, but extremely tedious and monotonous just the same.  Enemy AI doesn't have much worthy of mention. There are three enemy types: bandits, robots, and bugs, and you will be utterly sick and tired of every single one of them before you're eight hours into the game. All enemies act the same; if they're melee or suicide units, they haplessly run at you with no regards to the damage they're taking. If they're ranged units, they will zig-zag around or hide behind cover. There are also flying units, but I think I'll let you explore that special ring of hell just for yourself -- let's just hope you never have to shoot for a second wind if they're all you're fighting. I also hope you never intend to find truly decent loot from enemies that aren't area bosses.  The visual department is pretty much the only space where I can give solid compliments, but still no perfect scores. The cel-shaded style really works in the game's advantage, and the environments are a huge step up to the non-stop deserts and industrial areas featured in the first entry (now you get snow and some trees!) Enemy designs are decent, albeit they could use some more differentiation, especially with the robots. However, you might notice a few big errors. For one: THERE ARE NO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS IN THIS GAME; EVERYONE WEARS THE EXACT SAME NEUTRAL EXPRESSION NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR SAYING. YES, THIS IS A HUMONGOUS PROBLEM IN A GAME FROM A MILLION-DOLLAR CORPORATION, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR THIS ♥♥♥♥.  I'd mention sound, but I ran out of space to write about it. Game's enjoyable for a while but riddled with flaws. 5/10.",

However, the save game system is an absolute deal-breaker for me and, if I'd been warned about it, I'd never have wasted my money on the game. Simply put, there is no facility to 'save right here, right now', although the quit menu gives the impression that that's what you're doing. You're not; the game gives you the option to save, and you might think that that would mean when you come back to the game and choose 'continue', that's where you start. Wrong; the game remembers what you've done: what xp you've accumulated, what items you've picked up, what ammo you've expended; however, it drops you right back at the start of that section, with all new enemies in your way again. This is, frankly, shoddy, and reminds me of old console games with their limited save points. Apparently it's something to do with multiplayer games, but I have no particular desire to play this as anything other than a single player shooter. Why is there no option to start a game as single-player only, and save wherever you want? There should at least be an option to restart your game at one of the many checkpoints you've reached since the start of the level.  End of the day, this game looks good, but unless you've got the time to run through entire sections from start to finish, the savegame system means you'll see the same terrain, and the same mobs over and over again. They, of course, will be at full health and fully armed, while you've already fired off a load of ammo getting through it initially.

The approach to humor here is dumb and overblown. It reminds me of Patton Oswalt's bit about 'punching up' animated films. It just has goofy voice clips bolted onto a game that is colorful but not actually particularly funny. This feels desperate and pathetic at times, like a happy dog that jumps up on you. There's a lot of jokes about killing midgets, and I don't get why that's funny. It's just off-putting. Little people exist, and they have had a hard time of things throughout history because of jokes like these that make them the target of ridicule. I'm not just acting offended on their behalf; it made me feel dirty, because the game, in requiring you to kill lots and lots of midgets and then congratulating you on it, makes you an accomplice to its cruel and insensitive attitudes.  The reincarnation mechanic might be the dumbest aspect from a gameplay standpoint. If you die, you just respawn at a checkpoint minus a few hundred bucks (this is the only thing cash is good for, as you regularly loot better stuff than can be bought from vendors) and then wander through empty areas back to where you were and wipe out the rest of the enemies. So if it comes down to it, you can mindlessly brute-force your way through any given mission. Shouldn't you actually have to be good at a level to pass it? Maybe it's less stupid in multiplayer? Diegetic devices that allow player characters to die over and over again (Bioshock and PoP:SoT also come to mind here) always seem too clever by half, are rarely internally consistent, and can even (as seen here) be detrimental to gameplay. The best instance of it was probably the otherwise-mediocre Scrapland, which not only had NPCs use it too but built the entire story around the mechanic without making it a hokey meta framing thing like Assassin's Creed.  If you like games that are fun, but irritating and mean-spirited, well then Borderlands 2 should be right up your alley.",

And as if that isn't enough, the penalty for dieing is pretty steep whereby the player is financially punished with a significantly large chunk of change taken from the player's in-game earnings each time the player respawns.

Pros: You can kill stuff and blow ♥♥♥♥ up.

Seriously, this is a pathetic game, reminded me of BioShock, another pathetic game but at least BioShock tried with the graphics. Not sure if I'm paying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1980's cartoon or a really long cut scene. I played this for about 2 hours and my mood went from: Ok, let's try this, to, this ain't bad, to, this is actually not bad to, to WTF, to, this is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The graphics, for starters, I have better SNES games graphics wise. Looks like it was built by a bunch of art school dropouts. The guns you get are ♥♥♥♥, all 10 million of them. In good games, you only need 5 guns. Then they got this 'Last Man Standing' thing like in Max Payne 3, except the enemies disapear completely 75% of the time; which defies the purpose of such features.   I'd say it's a game for kids or childish people, don't pay more than $5 for it because even at that price, it's all it's worth. I wish I could comapre it with any other game but I cannot. It's but a mere continuance of the over-hyped BioShock.  Another waste of cash... experienced players will find this game boring fast, childish, it's not a fulfilling game to play, nor a game worth playing twice. Personally, if a game doesn't shine me on after 2 hours it's not worth my time but I'm an extremely demanding gamer, this game is just dumb, cheap and too sci-fi'ish for my taste.   Seriously, this is a huge dissapointment on 2K, playing BL2 after Mafia II... one extreme to another. Some may like it, it's not ♥♥♥♥ poor like many otehr games I have.  For the fact I do not enjoy this game but is well made, I don't recommend it based on the fact that I could do better graphics and suck at graphic design and the guns are too much for not enough. It's a game made for PG13 audience IE: no nudity, no swearing, no killing humans, guns that don't exist in real life, too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gy for me.  Been gaming for longer than most gamers are alive today, don't ask me to bask in games I find lame... I'd rather play Mafia II, Saint's Row III or Deus Ex III over and over again over playing BL2 all the way through even once.  Wished I had even one good thing to say but I don't. Took longer to download the game than the amount of time I played... took seconds to remove, that's the good part.  This game was recommended to me as a Sain't Row alternative... if you are in thsi same situation, play SR again, that's what I'm off to do after I'm done this review.",

Why? Well the creators were caught in a bit of hot water lately which personally has me disgusted and puts them worse than EA. See, Gearbox was the one making and showing off all those trailers for Aliens:CM. You know the bait &amp; switch ones that were all lies and completely different games? Well the UK doesn't take kindly to false advertising and is charging them with $2,000,000 in fees. (When EA was given a similar situation with Dungeon Keeper iOS they paid their fine...) Gearbox (however) wanted to play dumb and say that it wasn't their fault at all, instead it was all SEGAs. So SEGA took them to court and proved that it was in fact Gearbox. Despite this tretchery SEGA still offered to pay $1,200,000 of the bill, as they should have kept a closer eye and tighter leash on Gearbox. That's over half the fine they're offering to pay there, for something they didn't do. But no, Gearbox's CEO said, and I quote 'I'm Randy Pitchford, I'll do whatever the f*ck I want.' and refuses to pay a penny for all the false advertising he did to get his game sold.  So do you *really* want to support a company that sees you as nothing more than cash to be gathered? Do you *REALLY* want to keep giving money to people who will happily lie to your faces just to make a quick buck? If you answer 'yes' then congrats, you're an indoctrinated fanboy/girl who not only doesn't belong in the gaming community, but is contributing to what is making it die. So long as people support these kinds of practices, they will continue to be used. Enjoy your always online DRM, unfinished games that use memes as their selling point, and companies that openly screw you over and don't care. But I, as a true gamer, will not stand for it and watch my favorite hobby be destoryed by greedy non-persons like Gearbox and EA. And the blind sheep that follow them.   [11/30/2013] 'Why do we have to spend all this time upgrading things we can already do? It's called progression in gaming, a must have these days...' - Deadpool  With the exception of Tiny Tena's Assault DLC this is pretty... Meh... I mean I totally understand that people don't like challenge anymore because if they get their butt kicked by a bunch of 0s and 1s it makes the a bit angry. But... Ehhhhhh...  I will never understand the attraction of the MMO-styled game. You could have just had a liner plot for us to follow that involves stopping Handsome Jack and busting open the vault and it would have been great. But instead... Not even 10 minute in... 'Please go kill X amount of monster Y'. Oh goodie it's going to be one of these games... Where the creators want it to only FEEL like a longer experience by reusing the exact same four quests with different names and enemies each time. What should have been a 16-20 hour game with a 8-10 hour story suddenly becomes an 40+ hour grindfest. Doesn't matter how skilled you are, the game will not let you go to the next story mission until you've done at least 3 hours of side missions to level up to the point where it won't kill you in one hit, at which point there's not even a challenge in the game, it's just pointing and clicking.  But to be fair, the people buying this game aren't exactly the most 'gaming talented'. It takes a truely... special... type of gamer to die in a game with no learning curve. There is something seriously wrong when you can play a game like this and die, as a level 28, while I, a level 22 can't even manage to get shot. But hey I guess everyone needs something they can feel good at, and honestly, this is only a *single* step up from farmville. But it's pretty, enjoy your 80+ hour total firework show!

If the person was someone who prefered single player games instead, I would not dare recommend this. Borderland 2 is a game that requires co-op assistance to actually be enjoyed. If you're not playing with someone, the game gets quickly boring.  Even from the start I found this game quite disappointing, but when I started playing with others online I got to like it a little more as I played. One other thing you definitely notice in the game is that it can be extremely difficult at times, and not the kind of difficult that would make you determined to try again. When I was soloing the game I died VERY often, and too quickly on a mission. When I was in a group of 2, it was impossible to get through the stage because of how overpowered the enemies were. While I don't mind the missions taking an hour or so to complete, what makes it a true pain is if you don't complete it you have to start from the beginning again if you decide to quit the game.   If I had to make a suggestion, a difficulty adjuster would help not make the game very frustrating for newcomers along with computer co-op partners for those who prefer not to play with others/online. It would surely make the game much more bearable.  What I mostly liked about the game was the great story and characters that made the game lively and interesting. I surely would have loved to see the game until the end if I didn't like it as I do.  I believe Borderlands 2 goes in the category of 'overrated'. While this is a game that would be loved by co-op/multiplayer player fans, players such as me who prefer to solo or single player games will find this game disappointing.  Rating: 5/10 ",

Pro:  ~ Fun for Multi playing ~ Somewhat funny NPC conversations  ~ Things explodes  ~ The art direction is quite nice  Con:  ~ The environment is extremely static. Nothing reacts to explosions or any other combat activities (Except barrels or animal crap)  ~ If one inch of a floor pops out, it will stop you dead regardless on if you're running or walking. Seen NPC enemies spaz out from seeming nothing.  ~ Unfriendly exploration for the maps. In another word, very restrictive limited map exploration options.  ~ Mobs fights dirty and often unfairly in a predictable way.  ~ Mobs would roll around and none of your shots will hit it until it stops rolling ~ Extremely low replay value. Same old story line, same old side quests, same old choices, same old rewards ~ The guns you find will not be enough and/or good enough for the job at hand. You will be forced to use the golden keys just to get to the next stages in game and prevent you from pulling your hair out from frustration.  ~ Very low Legendary drop rate (Only found 1 Legendary drop rate in 165 hours of game playing)  ~ Character outfits is extremely generic with mostly just color change options (unless you buy the DLC just to get a few more variations)  ~ Spend $200,000+ on the slot machine, never got anything better than Blue weapons ~ Invisble boundry walls everywhere making it feel very trapped for a map ~ Limit options for cars to drive ~ If you die, all mobs including boss mobs will reset their health instantly  ~ Mobs respawns too quickly (about 10 min)  ~ Getting reincarnated by the machine after death takes so long to wait, unnecessary reincarnation cut scene.  ~ Worth repeating: The environment is extremely static, doesn't encourage any interactions with the environment other than opening chests or blowing up barrels.

Definitely not recommended.",
