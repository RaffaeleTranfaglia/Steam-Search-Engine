            "review_text": "I enjoyed Master Reboot so I decided to pick this game up and I'm glad I did. Soul Axiom is a first-person puzzle game wheere you solve puzzles by interacting with them with different special powers, represented by changing the color of your hands. I found the puzzles to be mostly enjoyable, some were really obvious and some were sort of non-intuitive, but most found a happy medium and I loved the 'duh' moment you get when you solve a challenging one. The visuals and soundtrack really add to the game, my only complaint is some levels were a bit too dark, although you can use your hands as 'flashlights.' The atmostphere was great to, and there are some jump scares but I think they were well done. The game is made up of a diverse group of enviroments, all with neat little details and the design overall is very abstract. Playing the first game isn't required to get into the story although it will help, and there's lots of little references which were fun to discover. The story is very nonlinear, don't expect to understand everything at once. Although like MR, once you piece everything together it really shines. Performance was mostly good except I noticed the engine struggled a bit when you shatter something, like wood or ice, but the game was never unplayable. My biggest complaint is probably the lack of save files, if you exit the level you have to start over which is kind of annoying. Overall a very fun puzzle game with an great story and aesthetic.",

I do like the scenery of each level and that each had an theme that they stuck with until the end of the level. For a few bucks sure its a good buy but for $10 or $20 its definitely not worth it.",

The start of the game does nothing unfortunately. It does not intrigue me and compel me to figure our what is going on. It does not blow me away with stunning visuals, or fantastic mechanics - (the main mechanic of the game seems a bit stale). It is slow, odd and boring.  Pity, looks like a lot of effort went into this game. I would not recommend this as an adventure or puzzle game.",

Clunky controls, beyond simple puzzles (I am using the word Puzzle lightly). Every thing is dark or super cartoony which brings me out of the game.   There are plenty of better games out there.",
