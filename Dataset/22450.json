There isn't much in this game that it's remarkable, but in all I can tell it's a good experience.  To put it short, its an action packed dungeon crawler. There are some puzzles and secrets, also you can 'collect' Lore pieces, wich tell you the full backstory of the game once you gather them all. The interesting part about those lore pieces is hearing the story told by nobodies and simple people (often no so simple).  On sale its a total win, even if it isn't that expensive.",

            "review_text": "really great game with the sexiest char since lara croft - played it way back in the day on xbox360 loved it then and am really glad to say that playing it on pc today it really hasnt aged at all. this is a fine example of what a great plot with good voice acting should be like in cut sequences. the banter between the main two chars is hilarious at times - shoot chickens - seriously keep shooting chickens and doing pointless stuff and your partner comments on it. some of the banter in this game had me in sticthes and the game itself is really good with nothing too taxing in terms of skill. A basic but adequate upgrade and magic system make this a really good game to have in your library and when its on sale you cannot go wrong with a fine game like this at all. and that elf is so damn sexy i dare you not to keep changing your camera view as you perv away at her fine ♥♥♥",

            "review_text": "This game was moderately fun, I suppose. Decent controls, action, fighting style...great co-op, but when Gamespy or whatever it was using to do online work closed down, it's become impossible to play with others online, which honestly was the biggest redeeming factor to this game. If you can play it local Co-op, great, but without the online Co-op it's just average. Forget any memorable story, characters, action, gameplay.. it's forgettable, minus the gameplay which is just 'Decent', so unfortunately, it's a no-go. There are better co-op action games out there that still work online.",

            "review_text": "A very cool and unique co-op game. More like a sleeper hit. Probably didn't do so well since Gamespy shut down and that is what this game used for multiplayer connection.  You can however get around this since games with LAN support can use a program like Tunngle to continue playing co-op games no longer supported by Gamespy (again, they need to support Local Area Network [LAN]). It may be a little frustrating for users who are not very familiar with networking but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy.  The game is not completely without faults as it will sometimes crash near the end of the level (or the start of a new one) randomly. This seems to happen mostly if you're playing the game for long periods of time.   Since the game can be bought for cheap (right now on a steam sale for $1.64) you really can't go wrong.  The graphics are good, the gameplay plays like a 3rd person hack/slash/shooter. The controls can feel a little wonky (I used keyboard/mouse) and the user interface could be MUCH better but all in all you get used to it and it's fine.",

            "review_text": "I am very pleasantly surprised by this game. So much so, that I feel comfortable giving it a positive riview despite the fact that I have not gotten so far into the game.  While the graphics were not above average even when it was published, this is only a minor flaw, outshined greatly by the story and character. The two protaganists are fun to listen to interact, and are thankfully not the standard fantasy trope of wild yet wise elf and impulsive yet stoic human. Caddoc (human) and E'lara (elf) almost give the impression of an affectionate married couple, bickering good-naturedly with one another yet always supportive. The characters are flawed, real, and interesting. Few games do character interaction better. The story is darker and grimier than most fantasy, which contrasts nicely with the character's general optimism. The player is given the impression that if the characters were not so, that the darkness would swallow them up.  The game does not have heavy RPG elements, but what there is have been done competently. The voice acting is done well.  The control scheme leaves a bit to be desired, and navigating menus is clunky. If you enjoy lore scraps in the vein of Dark Souls or Victor Vran, this is the game for you; however, certain 'entries' such as monster lore appear to one-time shots with no way to go back and view after the first time, and it is easy to miss it entirely.  Hunted is well worth the purchase, particularly at its current price point.",

I looked at it and decided to buy it with my brother cause it looked sick. It's awesome. Co-op makes the game super enjoyable, even though it doesn't work sometimes, but yeah. The combat isn't repetitive, just difficult with lots of enemies. For some reason the game has really big difficulty spikes that make you hurt until finally you figured out how to deal with it. Once you get how te game works and how to counter the different enemie, you are all set. The ranged combat plays almost like resident evil revelations, just the way the movement and camera works, and melee combat is similar to darksouls. It is definitly worth the $6 or whatever it's and is quite fun to play.",
