It's much more engaging than any other idle game I've played in the past, completely addictive, and trailblazing. Sure, it takes all the elements from other games that I've loved, but this adds so many new twists and turns that just seem to fit right in, and really feel like they belong. It makes it its own, and turns it into something completely new, refreshing, and fun! The chatroom is gorgeous, a great thing to have, so even if I'm sitting at my PC idlilng, I can still hang out with friends, meet new people, chat strategies etc. I love this game!",

            "review_text": "Crusaders of the Lost Idols is a clicker game, well, unless you're recruiting characters that will deal damage for you. Set in a fantasy world, your goal is to pass through levels, with your party which is moving by itself and with enemies coming to you. Complete the quest of the level to access the next one. Every five levels, you get a boss to kill, which gives a chest. The latter hides cards with permanent bonus, new gears, new clothes or buffs to use during a quest.  The money you're collecting will serve to upgrade your characters, to recruit new ones or to unlock new abilities. Some of them are specific to your character, others will affect those next or in front of you while special ones will be used during the levels. In other words, each character can be useful.... if only you weren't stuck to 10 characters maximum.  That's the core of this free-to-play. Only chests are for now a paying item if you want to advance faster.  The graphics are quite cheerful and colorful, the soundtrack is nice. I must say that you don't need an account somewhere to play it. However, you can play it elsewhere and link both accounts.  I'm just disappointed that in-game achievements aren't counted here. Apparently, you need to reset the world (where you don't loose your acquired trinkets for example) so that Steam is considering that achievements can be unlocked. I don't know as I need to reach the requirements for it.  Anyway, the game is surprisingly addictive and simple to handle. Cards are just bonus, you don't have to build a deck, which is a relief for me. Given the fact that it's free, without account to make, give it a shot. Be warned though, you may find it slow without chests. I could enjoy the potential of this game thanks to orly and its key giveaway.  EDIT: I had to uninstall the game - apparently, it was causing a problem with launching games freshly updated or uploaded.",

While I enjoy Time Clickers and Clicker Heroes, this game has a lot more micro-management - which I do not enjoy. With all the items and stat boosts its also a lot more complex/intransparent.  I can see others enjoying this though, so - even though I did not enjoy it - I give it my recommendation.",

Pros: -&gt; Innovative idle game experience -&gt; You got daily missions wich give you Red Rubies. -&gt; Strategy involved, wich means diferent formations wich equals to diferent ways of playstyles. -&gt; * You can't move to next level till you get enought dps (or click damage) like clicker heroes. -&gt; Equipments, Exp &amp; Trinkets to boost your crusaders dps and gold find. -&gt; Good amount of buffs. -&gt; Monthly events. Cons: -&gt; 1st world reset takes about 2 days (time to get involved with the game). -&gt; No 'multiplayer', i would love to see some kind of system where you can help your friends or something like that. -&gt; No Auto level forward (on steam version only)  What needs to be added to the game? (My opinion) -&gt; Weekly and mothly quests. -&gt; More ways of using rubies. -&gt; 5 daily quests total, being able to purchase 1 chest per day. -&gt; Login bonus. -&gt; Clickables, reason: if i want to farm gold to go up a level i just leave the game open farming chests. But if im playing the game it could at least give me a bit of a bonus. ",

There are 30 of them. The other option is to pay money to buy special event chests to get the gear you need for them. I wish that they would add new free ways to recruit these event heroes that won't require half a year playtime per hero.",

Along with choosing characters and equipping them with gear; the player has the option of many different quests to partake in after resetting the world. Some quest runs require an amount of strategy, while others are just level runs. There are different formations in each quest tier for the characters to be placed in as well. On top of the frequent updates, there are seasonal challenges to partake in. While fun, they are limited to a few days and if you're not quite up there in experience, you'll only be able to make it past the first two missions in the quest. Idol collection is a big part of the game and the player cannot proceed far without obtaining a fair amount. It's a grind but I find it to be pleasant. Overall, I would say it's a new take on an increasingly popular gaming genre. With RPG elements added; it's definitely worth trying it out. You should know within the first hour or less if it's something you'll enjoy.  8/10",

Great execution of the clicker genre of games. Not only do you unlock new heroes, you place them in formation (10 on screen at a time) and certain ones will interact with others causing bonuses to damage and such.   On top of that, there are the expected items to gain that boost damage and gold gains.   The biggest difference I noticed, between this one and Clicker Heroes, is that this one scrolls from left to right, as if the characters are walking through the forest or environment.   Additionally, if the monsters get to your heroes, they actually damage and can kill them for that round, causing you to need to go back a level and earn more gold.  The interface is great, easy to pickup and understand, and the gameplay is just fun.   There's also XP gain, which means that after 5 hours of having a hero in formation, their DPS will double due to XP gained. It's a small but nice touch.  There's really a lot to like about this game, and it's done something very right with its entering the clicker scene. Not only has it got its own charm and style, it sets itself apart enough from the crowd that it has managed to truly bring something new to the scene.  Certainly worth your download.",

            "review_text": "Okay, let's face it - if you have over 2500 hours of play time on record for a single game, it is probably kind of addictive. Of course, high play times are typical for idle games that are running in the background for hours because they need very little attention while playing - sometimes only a few mouse clicks per hour.  But to keep a player interested for many months the game needs some depth that is not usually found in free-to-play casual clicker idle games.  Well, yes, CotLI is a huge time waster, it is repetitive, and progress is achieved mainly by grinding. However, there are many good aspects combined in this game:  - ongoing expansion of permanent content in the game (new campaigns with higher difficulty for veterans) - frequent game events providing additional content for a few days (allowing to recruit new characters with different abilities) - temporary weekend buffs for a few crusaders that allow progressing faster and further in the game - strong strategic component depending on the formation and choice of crusaders that are currently used - both active (meaning: clicking) and passive (meaning: waiting) gameplay possible - different tactics can lead to success (optimizing high DPS, tanking, healing, gold find, etc.) - clever use of formation abilities can be far more effective than simply using the strongest crusaders) - earned Idols can be used to learn additional talents - Enchantment Points compensate the limited amount of crusader-specific items - Missions for crusaders that are currently not in use - funny ideas for campaigns and game events - ...  This is not bad at all for a free-to-play game! And even the pay-to-win aspect is rather discreet for such a game (purchasable items are a bit more effective than the best versions found for free in the game, but since you are using a formation of multiple crusaders, one item of one crusader alone usually makes not a big difference but it can accelerate the progress).  So if you're looking for a clicker idle game with some strategic depth and variety, this is the one! :-) ",

Each event that goes live dangles powerful items at you that are only obtainable with RL cash purchases of chests, the price of which has risen recently.  The game constantly reminds you of the purchases to be made each time you start it, they are constantly onscreen with popups to the right and the devs even like to email you about every new event and the new legendary item you can get for spending your money (these events occur very often).  I have started to feel tainted by this games greed and have now uninstalled it, unless the devs change their ways I will not be returning to it.  If you want good idle games look towards adventure capitalist, clicker heroes, idling to rule the gods, etc. They all offer these purchases but not in such a way as this game constantly does.",
