Sees silhouette in the distance. Gets scared as all hell. Turns on flashlight. Sees a scarecrow. Instant relief. Scarecrow turns head. NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE Exit game, uninstall, have nightmares for two days. 10/10 would have nightmares about scarecrow again.  EDIT: Wow, people actually looked at this review. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ACADEMY.",

            "review_text": "  Its a fun game. Even though I havent gotten caught by the creature thing yet this game still creeps me out. I love how it tries to build up intensity instead of using endless jumpscares. Tips:  *Every once in a while stop and turn in a full circle slowly to prevent being caught. *When you see the scarecrow try to stay far away from it when you are passing it. *Try to play without using your flashlight. *Don't jerk the camera too much because the creature will sense it and come after you. *Dont run unless you hear running footsteps behind you. You might be able to get away if you start running fast enough. (It might still catch you if you run)",
