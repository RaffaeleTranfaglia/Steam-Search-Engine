    "description": "Remind yourself maintains a characteristic of suspence and horror where the story has a fundamental role and you must guess because it has multiple endings. It will prove your mind. It is needed that a player be quiet in extremes moments to maintain himself alive. Each step will be an experience to have into account.",
