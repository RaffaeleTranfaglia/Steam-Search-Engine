            "review_text": "After all the bad press surrounding slapping the famous XCOM (sic.) brand on a TPS there is a surprising decent game left behind. You are Agent Carter, a cynical broken man thrust into the limelight after an Alien invasion now tasked as the tip of the spear against this new threat.  There are many elements and ideas drawn from the previous games but it is a strictly linear and pre determined experience. You operate out of XCOM headquarters between the main story missions. You have free run of the base and are able to go on minor side missions, perform investigations inside the base and sent agents out on missions on their own to gain experience and new equipment. Sadly even though the base has vast Engineering and Lab sections, they are cosmetic. You can't perform research on new equipment or ideas or perform autopsies. The only way to get new equipment is to find it during a mission and the only way to learn about various elements is to click on one of the copious clickables in the world.  Carter can bring two additional henchmen with him on a mission from one of the four classes. They are all pretty standard tropes from other games but do add an interesting element to the game. Do you go all out attack with commandos and snipers, sit back and dig in with engineers and support specialists or a combination of the four. You can move henchmen around the battleground, conveniently littered with waist high walls, flank enemies and use the various abilities in conjunction with Carter's unique ones for a multitude of strategies. But...  A warning: The friendly henchmen AI is some of the worst you'll ever see. They'll jump out of cover, run left, run right, turn a full circle, jump over another wall landing right next the nearest enemy before coming back to you. They need to be babysat at all times or they will be useless.  Where the game shines is in the fantastic recreation of cold-war early sixties America and the digital acting. The influence of Mass Effect is obvious but still welcome and the story? Well, let's just say it takes quite the left turn near the end!  Update for badge!  I'll give it 7.5/10 on the AAA scale of 7-10",

            "review_text": "Like a fair number of other games today XCOM Declassified is a case of the mistaken identity. Bureau is a great game solid 3D person action with surprisingly deep tactical elements, great visuals, and nice (for the pulp genre) story.   The problem is the game has a lot more in common with Mass Effect than with XCom.   Combat, squad management, agent powers, level design... everything is patterned after Mass Effect. Even story really - loose team-building part, replace Reapers with Outsiders, replace indoctrination with infection... few more similar changes... put the whole thing on 1960s Earth = Mass Effect Deja Vu.  The bottom line, if you are looking for an XCom game - you might as well pass. If Mass Effect streamlined for combat missions and set in 60s sounds interesting - the game is more than worth the price tag.  Note: Keep in mind the game really is tactical, on anything but the easiest difficulty expect to spend more of your time commanding the squad than pulling a trigger.",

I like the team aspect of XCOM Declassified, you giving commands to your team and the fact that you actually need them to survive when things get 'hairy'.  The story was pretty good and the dialogues and backstory on a lot of characters were refreshing to see, you can tell that they worked on it, instead of just relying on the action aspect of the game.  The DLCs were kinda pointless, if you ask me, so i wouldnt recommend buying them at full price. Hangar 6 R&amp;D is okay but the others are useless and dont really add a lot to your game experience.  8/10. Buy the game and play it, you will enjoy it.",

It's definitely not Enemy Unknown, but I enjoyed it non the less.  The story was compelling, if a bit rushed in parts, and I wish they had incorporated some of the research and building aspects of Unknown but in the end I was completely happy with my purchase. The end of the game feels very rushed, and I would have liked a bit more diversity among my squad as I tended to use the same two every mission.

I enjoyed the idea of 1950s secret branch of government whos whole goal is to keep people unaware of the existance of aliens. I would have liked to have more opertives in the field or better customization of field agents like XCOM enemy unknown. The only thing similar to XCOM was the aliens and the way you use cover/abilites. Everthing else is different. Overall graphics were great. Worth the $20 buck price tag 89/100",

No base building, research, or anything that you associate with XCOM games. The missions are very linear. There's not much variation you can really employ.   Lot of small touches to add to immersive experience if you want to explore them. Some good visual effects, decent use of the Unreal engine.  I reccomend it. It's a fun game.

You can find little side missions by just looking around the main base which adds a very slight amount of things to do and the little notes and reports dotted around add to the story.  The missions themselves are also mixed, the gameplay is actually pretty intense sometimes where you actually have to plan out what you want to do next and how you want to approach a level. This is good and the squad is a good idea, I get a similar attachment to my soldiers in the actual X-COM games. The friendly AI can be beyond stupid sometimes however and just move randomly without orders into enemy fire and create loads of problems.  Going back to squads this is an element of the game I enjoy, being able to customise them (although limited) gives the soliders individuality and it's a small touch but changing their weapons and backpacks adds a little bit more strategy to an otherwise normal shooter.  Overall the game's a bit generic in its gameplay but the styling is good and it certainly has its moments, I recommend this on sale to anyone who likes shooters and also the idea of the X-COM series. Maybe for someone who likes the look of X-COM but is intimidated by the strategy of that game.",

If you decide to play out each choice in the dialog wheel however, you might find yourself listening to ALOT of talking. They give good information about situations, but can be quite a hassle if you're not a big fan of this. Some parts of the story feel a bit rushed or lack context, but flows nicely.  It plays similar to Mass Effect; dialog wheels, a mass effect 3rd person combat feel, and having a sci-fi/alien atmosphere to it.  XCOM DECLASSIFIED IS A PRETTY NEAT GAME.   8.5/10     ",

My Thoughts:- A good game and a new take on the X-com type, with nice graphics and good story. The tactical feel of it as you command 2 of the agents around a real time battlefield is good.  Achievements:- 41 of 41 (100%) achievements earned  Graphics:- graphics are quite well done, with the use of DX11 and everything maxed out looks very well done indeed.  Story:- it all starts with one agent and a brief case, that’s when things turn strange, aliens attack earth and its your job to fight them off.  Replayability:- maybe 3 or 4 plays same with the DLC.  What Could Be Added: more custom stuff for agents as well as a change sex option?  Rating:- 8 / 10",

            "review_text": "The Bureau is a very different take on the XCOM universe... it was set in 1960's, height of cold war, when a jamming wave blanketed the nation, and aliens invaded Earth. With comm blackout, information is slow to trickle in, but it appears the nation's military had been crippled, and only XCOM, a command setup to take control in case of full war, is mankind's last hope.   At its heart Bureau is a tactical shooter where you control two other agents to deploy where you want them as well as deploy their special abilities, such as sniper hit, deploy turret, and so on. As the senior agent, you have abilities too, and you'll get more as time go on.   Graphics are quite good and the desolation in the middle of 1960's America is quite evocative. Agents were wearing suits and appropriate hairstyles, esp. the ladies.   There is also quite a bit of dialog, with choices you have to make (and they will affect the outcome, at least a little) a bit like Mass Effect series. Talk to other people in the base, for additional clues, expositions, notes, and whatnot that tells you more about the people you meet. Characterization is quite nice.   Managing the agents during a sort of 'Matrix-like super-slo-mo' mode known as 'Battle Focus' is the key here, where you place the agents at vantage points so they can engage the enemy effectively is key. Flanking is often the best way, as are using the environment such as explosive barrels (yes, that too). As agents gain 'rank' they also gain special abilities they can deploy. The key is to deploy them at the right place at the right time, and that's your job as commander.   The Aliens are nicely animated and sprints into and out of cover and will attempt to flank if possible. However, they are not very bright can can be outsmarted. Later you'll run into bosses, like Mutons and Sectopods (walkers), though most are just Greys. There are occasional elites and commanders. Commanders are tough as they can give shields to other units, but that just makes them vulnerable to strikes when they do that. Add drones, turrets, and you can be in a tough fight.   This alternate history is a lot of fun to play in. It is highly recommended if you like the genre.",

            "review_text": "I think it's an excellent, fun, accessible game and a great low-impact X-Com game to boot. It definitely takes the franchise in a different fork (more mission and story driven than strategy) but the strategic aspects aren't completely absent and at later levels if you have the difficulty up you actually need to control your agents and position them if you're going to survive.  This is coming from someone who played X-COM and Terror From the Deep on the Amiga back in the day and loved the hell out of them, and I can honestly say I've thoroughly enjoyed the game. It has an LA Noire sense to it, with intrigue and loads of sideplots and stuff you can do if you wander the base and talk to people. I didn't particularly care for any of the X-Coms after Terror From the Deep aside from the X-Com remake, so if you're like me and you like the first two X-Coms and don't necessarily need a heavy squad-management and base builder sim, give it a try.  My only lament is that any gear you want you must discover in missions, some of them completely optional. There is no 'research' beyond what the storyline demands, so the game loses some of the greatness of being able to research and retrofit the alien tech as you recover corpses and such. While it's something I missed in the game, the fact that once you salvage alien technology in the field X-Com can reproduce it for all of your agents is cool.  I'd like to see a sequel to this game made with some more rpg elements like more skill branching, more skill levels, and research and development. Everything else I found to be quite refreshing, especially the timeline which hearkens back to good old Cold War era paranoia, Area 51 and 'the end of innocence'. ",

Unfortunately, and with much regret, those three things were included in the game and for some unknowable reason were made integral, and so the final score must suffer slightly as a result.   The ending was very strange with a weird narrative device that would have been interesting in a written format, but felt a little frustrating with you being ripped out of the driver's seat of your own character.

Once you get past that the game does require a lot of tactical flexibility and a bit of fast thinking (I played through on Veteran the first time). With a limited squad size it forces you to pick, choose, and design your tactics for every occasion. The storyline was a bit short but it did do a good job of sucking you in.

The graphics are fantastic but not the framerate, nor is the fluncy of the controls. It plays a lot like Mass Effect 3 but it doesn't have that game's slick controls. The controls also isn't very intuitive, especially regarding grenade throwing and the battle HUD. The AI isn't terribly smart and likes to die a lot due to silly moves, and the gameplay is fairly difficult even in Normal.  However, I like the game settings, and being XCOM you're treated with a huge feast of alien graphics. The base is the equivalent of The Citedal on Mass Effect 3, albeit without much interaction with NPCs nor does it have as much events. You can send your squads to seperate missions while you handle the main ones, and it hits me as such a good idea that I wonder why Mass Effect 3 doesn't do this. Then there's the gameplay, which again plays a lot like Mass Effect 3, but one thing that it handles well is cover. In ME3 it can be difficult to know whether you managed to send your squad to cover or just standing before it, but this isn't a poblem here. You can even issue a chain of commands for them to execute sequentially, which is a huge plus.  Try this out before judging it. It is flawed, but still a must have for XCOM fans.",

            "review_text": "I know this is a very controversial game, hence it's mixed reviews. My son was all into XCOM and I picked this up for him during a Steam sale and he seemed to love it, quickly finishing it and it's DLC. It took me a while, but finally through the magic of Steam Family Sharing, I decided to give it a go. And honestly, to my shock and dismay. I liked it. No, it's not XCOM the strategy game. No, it doesn't seem to follow the established 'lore', such as it is. But if you can approach the game as a tactical rpg-lite squad shooter with a decent story, I think you'll be impressed. For hardcore XCOM fans, think of this as an alternate universe version of XCOM or treat it as it should be, it's own thing. Now onto the review!  +/- Graphics, being built on the Unreal engine, are pretty good. It has some nice particle effects, models are pretty good, and a decently variety of both enemy models and settings. It very much has the 'Bioshock' look to the UI and world, while art direction pulls a good 50's vibe and flavor to most everything. Weaknesses are mostly confined to poor facial animations and sometimes stiff looking movements, but overall the game has a clean and consistent look that works really well for the game.  +/- Story and voice acting is played upon very heavily in this title, far, far more in this title than any previous XCOM game. There are multiple NPC's and your own character that are all developed decently well, if not anything exceptional. You can tell they were heavily inspired by the Mass Effect school of Story but they never quite reach those heights. Most dialog is decently written and spoke well, but while enjoyable, there is no top tier level story telling to be had and much of it feels like it contridicts much of what is presented in the XCOM game. Purists might cry foul and let what is presented distract them, but again, pretend it's an alternate version of the XCOM universe and enjoy the more personal ride.  +/- Combat and powers are obviously the main focus here and this is what drives most people batty. One thing I've learned playing through this entire game is that moving your squad mates is mostly an exercise in futility. Just save yourself some pain and let them move themselves. That doesn't mean you don't coordinate them because this is not a game that you win by playing it as a shooter. Do that and you WILL cry. Powers are everything in this game and using your teams varied abilities is paramount to winning the game.   Using your abilities will greatly slow down time (but not pause), allowing you to choose both your and your teammates abilities and their targets. In this respect (opposed to moving your teammates) the game works very well. Nothing is more satisfying than being pinned down by a sniper, Lifting him out of cover, and focusing fire to take them out quickly. Or taunting an Outsider, which makes them focus on one character and advance, right into a mine dropped by an Engineer. Realizing you can queue up multiple attacks helps you power attack the most dangerous enemiese quickly. I spent much of combat making sure everyone's powers are constantly being used AND upgrading them in a manner that fit my playstyle greatly improved the flow of combat and made the game more enjoyable. I will warn you, as at the start of the game, when you have few abilities, that the game is much more frustrating as the gunplay is at best, competent. This is not a run and gun game - that will kill you fast. Cover, flanking, short bursts, grenades, and abilities will win fights. Nothing else.  This game isn't for everyone, but if you like more tactical FPS, something that's a little different, and something with an interesting 50's take on XCOM, I'd recommend it. You can get it cheap regularly during steam sales and for those sale prices, it's highly recommended. Final score - 3.5/5",

Its not a traditional xcom game, but more of a Mass Effect simmilare game. Defenetly worth playing it, enjoyed this game more than some of the recent FPS games i played.  Postive + Awesome visuals, all from graphics on characters, envoriment to effects and lighting, kickass. + Intressting gameplay, with the amount of skills you and your agents have. + The strategy part in this is okey, it was abit difficult at start to give orders, but once you get into it, its pretty sweet. + Intressting level design, events that happen within them, places to see, keeps you wanting more.  Negativ - Repetetivt overall layout design: weapon crates before bossfight, placed one midlevel aswell. Section blocks, you knew a combat was to accure after these. Go offtrack the objective position, to discover something and on your way back you get ambushed. - Alot in the story didnt make any sence or was poorly explained. - The AI agents can be pretty useless if you dont give them orders or keep track of what they are up to. - Very limited customization.  Completed the whole game and all the DLC material. I thought it was pretty entertaining despite its flaws, if you get the chance to pick this game up, do it.",

It might not be in the traditional spirit of previous Xcom games.. and feels like a mashup between Mass Effect and Gears Of Wars, but it really seemed to deliver.  The Burearu is a game about the struggle of a classy detective and his squadmates against inhuman odds. The action is live and every order you make counts. The combat is full of tension and adrenaline, and I enjoyed every minute of it. If you're a fan of the Xcom lore and don't mind a deviation in gameplay style I'd definately recommend XCOM declassified.  If you are in it for the turn based mechanic however, I plead with you to wait for the next xcom title, as the active third person shooter gameplay may not be up your alley. It is quite polished and I can not think of a single complaint to make, but it does not follow the gameplay tradition of the games of the series that game before it.  That said, I have played all of The Bureau main campaign before writing this review (save for the post final boss content) and am 100% satisfied with the game save that I wish it was a little longer.",

I just wish they added some elements destruction, such as destroying chairs and tables.

I constantly used such abilities as put the turret or use critical shot during my playthrough.  The story starts very slow, but closer to the end it runs so fast and is full or different twists and revelations. Sure, it has lots of cliches, but it isn't that bad.

            "review_text": "First things first.  1, Forget about metascore (currently around 6.5), this game is far better than this. 2, This is not a strategy, it´s a tactical TPS. 3, I am not hardcore XCOM fan (I played only XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within - and I love those games) 4, I´m fat and I have a bad haircut. Deal with it.  When The Bureau was announced, I was super excited, because the trailer looked amazing, the premise of alien attack situated in the USA in 60s as FPS with some tactical elements seemed great. We all know that there were some problems during the development and that the game was reworked many times. That sounds like a bad thing ( *cough* Colonial Marines *cough*), eh? Well it is NOT.   GRAPHICS  are stunning (I played on DX11). Seriously, I´ve never seen a game with better lightning of a scene. I often caught myself just staring on the scene and taking screenshots, because it simply looked beautiful. It required a decent hardware though on HIGH setting, I played on MID-HIGH. No cons. 10/10   GAMEPLAY  The main part of the game are fights of course. Ever played Mass Effect? Imagine that, but better ( HERESY!). Far better. Yea, I said that. Here is the thing. On a mission, you can take two agents with you. Each agent can have one of four classes (Engineer, Recon, Commando, Support). I´ve ended up using Support and Engineer (Engineer can put a turret or mines on the battlefield, Support creates a shield, can give a stims to the whole team etc). You have a special class, called Agent. You can Heal, do some kind telekinetics, put a drone on a battlefield, and at level 9 out 10, you can use a mind control ( yea, those are not the agents you are looking for). You can give the commands to your team via command list (imagine KOTOR). When you press SPACE key, it will put you in slow motion mod and you have lot of time to think (not that much though, the game is not completely freezed). At the beginning of the game you will not use it that much, but when the ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan (that means when Sectopod or Muton introduce themselves on a scene), you will beg for mercy and most of the time, you will end up planning what to do, where to put your agents, and wondering how the ♥♥♥♥ you are supposed to kill them all. This game is challenging on a first walkthrough. Not THAT hard, but decently hard.   The weaponry of this game is not too big ( Colt 1911, M14, Springfield, then laser and plasma variations, grenades), but nothing to complain, the main power of this game is within the abilities/perks of the team).  One thing bothered me though. A.I. of the squadmates. There are not dumb, not really, but they are not shooting much when no order is given to them, and they do not roll out when a ♥♥♥♥ing grenade is under them! That was the only thing that was frustrating me. 8.5/10  STORY  is decent, nothing original of course, but it drives you towards the end, because you will want to know what the hell is happening here (or ... well, THERE). The main character, William Carter, is and old school badass agent with some serious issues from the past, but when the ♥♥♥♥ needs to be done, he is called for duty. I do not want to spoil anything, so let´s just say that story is kinda 'mass-effectish'. 7/10   FINAL VERDICT  I enjoyed this game very much, it was challenging, with not original, but interesting story. Together with awesome graphics and gameplay, I must say to the world - ♥♥♥♥ METACRITICS. I do regret that I didn´t bought this game at launch but on Summer Sale, and it´s shame that there will be no sequel ( the game was not succesful in terms of sales) 9/10",

            "review_text": "This is a good enough game but has some pretty bad points as well. It's a good game, good bit of fun alternate history however it does contain a few problems. Namely, an issue with a lot of games where it gives you command over a squad, is the AI squad. The game gives you full control over two teammates, little good that is as they don't listen to you... at all. It's like leading the two blind mice (it would've been the three blind mice but the third one didn't listen to what he was told and died.). You can give a move command and he'll move there but only for a short period of time and then decide it's time to rush the enemy that's the size of The Hulk. You tell them to attack a specific enemy but as they are in fact, the blind mice, they start to shoot at a completely different enemy. You can even have them flank the enemy, getting the perfect angle and shot onto the unknowing little alien but they'll still miss or fire in short enough bursts that a turtle could evade them. So you pretty much end up doing everything yourself and just using your teammates abilities, if they haven't died from trying to scare the enemy away by running really fast at them that is. Another issue is how they throw massive enemies at you without telling you anything about them, little hints or giving you appropriate weaponry to defeat them. I remember the first time they threw an enemy gunship at me and expected me to take it down with a rifle. I think it's rather obvious to say that it took a while. Other than those two points which do continuously get really rather annoying it is an alright game. I haven't played the original XCOM games so I have nothing to compare it to or moan about as 'It's not like the originals' or whatever so yeah. Good game, awful teammates. Buy this game, Or don't.

It has a great, well-written story, taking place in a very detailed and atmospheric US 60's world. Even though at first the protagonists of the game seemed to be very clyche (the smoking, drinking, I-don't-give-a-♥♥♥♥ anti hero, the I-have-to-do-what-has-to-be-done commander, the ice queen female agent and, oh, don't forget the immigrated Nazi scientist), during the story they appear to be diverse and deep characters, with their own past, problems and motivations. Due to their interactions, the story holds some big surprises during the last third of the game...  Another big plus are the battles: All missions are unique, with scripted events, discoveries, ambushes, some horror atmosphere and a great design. I enjoyed them much more than the unpersonal, repeating missions of X:COM Enemey Within. Nevertheless, this is a subject to your own preferences. You also have to use a lot of tactic in this game, however, the action is much more intense, as your squad is right in the middle, while explosions, bullets and laser beams are flying right around you. The agents have interesting abilities, and even the developing super powers of the main protagonist are logicallay explained during the game.  A lot of people critizise that the research part and the autopsies are held very simple in the game. Well, you are playing a SENIOR AGENT, not the BASE COMMANDER, so personally I would have wondered if I would have decided what research comes next, which alien we will cut first wide open to look after his bowel and so on. Therefore, you can talk with the scientists in the lab about their progress, watch them testing and developing new weapons (with some hilarious scenes) and interogate an outsider personally, having the chance to build up some sort of personal relationship with him (or you can beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him).  To make a long story short: If you are looking for another turn-based X:COM strategy game, with all the typical elements of this series, like research, base building, autopsies, and all other base commander's responsibilities, you will not be happy with this game.  But if you want to enjoy the beginning of X:COM through the view of a senior agent, if you are happy to play through an intense and well-written story, if you want to interact with interesting characters and you like action, though tactical battles, and all that in a very authentic 60's setup, you really should give this game a try!",

Nothing more, nothing less, and with a few spots that could have been better.  First of all, the story is close to non existent. Basicly everyone is functional as role that keeps an undercover agency working, instead of having any kind of personality. This isn't a negative thing, it's not why we ever liked any XCOM for, and this one isn't any different - until the very end. That where the devs decided to go for Mass Effect 3 storytelling, and not only they achieved a similar, but an even worse disaster of things that doesn't make sense anyhow, even on a single character's decision level or as game in a whole. Or just basic logic. But, this is mainly the last hour, and you'll have about 10-13 before that. How's that?  That part, is actually great. Just don't even think about touching a console controller or playing on normal difficulty. The combat is really challanging, smart and tactical, later on however can become slightly automatic and boring even on Veteran difficulty, just because you naturally reached better technology, levels and abilities. Other than that, it's like you have a dream Star Wars: Republic Commando, just not Star Wars, and there is more customization to it. Which leads me to my last point where I can throw anything bad on this game: customization. XCOM:EU could have been better on visual customization of our soldiers (and it's sequel is really good looking on this part!), but Declassified is another step back from that. You can change names, 3 or 4 colors on a suit, and that's it. When you recruit a new agent, you can also choose from ~8 premade faces, plus skin color. You cannot have women as agents, or customize visual looks, which is really a miss because you are not supposed to blend in to the crowd, you meet noone but aliens anyway.  Overall: Declassified is good, as an average good game can be. It has some unique touches here and there, the action depending on your chosen difficulty level can be really great, but it's one of those games that have absolutely great gameplay, but nothing else. The story is non existent, the customization in it's current form is really hurting that it's not deeper, the characters are throwaway faces. And that's totally fine for XCOM:EU that is a strategy game, but the whole reason Declassified exists as it is, is changing the perspective and bringing it down to a personal level of a group of agents, and it's a failure at that. If there is ever a sequel on this and they can improve on that, it's potentially GOTY material. For this, it's great, but you have to know why you buy it, to not have expectations the game cannot meet. My only problem is, that it still tries, and does it bad. But that's only the last hour, don't let me made you back off if you are thinking about buying it. That means you are looking for a good, really tactical TPS. Declassified, is really good at that.",

Unlike Enemy Unknown, the Bureau is more like a rewritten story of how XCOM came about. Despite many reviews criticising it for being too rigid and not really an enjoyable experience, I feel otherwise.  In my humble opinion, The Bureau storyline was splendidly written. Never once did I feel a sense of boredom. The gameplay can be cruel too, one wrong move and bam your created teammate/AI dies. Perhaps most people won't feel the lost but for me it did. When my AI died in one of the later missions I felt the full brunt of the impact, as I had to resort to using one of my lower level-ed AI in his stead. However that gives the game realism and in that sense the player have to make each and every decision wisely. On a side note, the gameplay(3rd person FPS) reminds me a lot of GRAW2(Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2).   As for replay value, it really depends on individuals. I probably would give the game another go and try out different classes but at the same time maybe not. Please pardon me for sidetracking, but I couldn't finish Bioshock Infinite, although it was spectacular I felt that it was overhyped, and not really my type of game whereas Dishonored had me engaged. Therefore as I said it depends on individuals! Just to give anyone reading this a hint: THERE WOULD BE A PLOT TWIST :D All in all, I give the Bureau the mighty thumbs up it deserves and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of FPS!",

You build your team and agents up throughout missions, even dispensing new recurits on their own misisons where they can gain experience and join you in future battles.   If you get caught in some mayhem and an agent on your team goes down, you'll fight for your life until the end of the battle at which point your trusted pilot Barnes will dispatch you a new recruit.

Remeniscent of Mass Effect when it comes to exploring the main headquaters and interacting with some of the main characters. The narrative is very linear and full of cliches.   A similar sentiment I can share with are the characters. None of them stand out as relatable or even worth detailing. The fedoras had more character than the actual characters.  The gameplay at best is abysmal, the fusion of TPS and RTS do not mix at all. The games design isn't justifiable enough to have the word XCOM in it's name.   Also the games AI isn't.  Example: I ordered my engineer to approach some cover just outside an enemy position (the enemy took cover in a book store hiding behind shelves and the main counter). So in close quaters he would have a clear shot with his shotgun. That was what should have happened.  Instead he took cover in the store, in the middle of the enemy position, he was surrounded on all sides and within seconds he was killed.   It was tragic but hillarious. I could've saved him due to the bleed out mecahnic but I decided not to for the greater good.   A more appropriate title/name for this game would be The Bureau: Darwin Awards Declassified.  I only recommend this game because of the shenanigans the AI is capable of enacting. But I would certainly recommend that you move straight onto Enemy Unknown.",

The Bureau is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on squad-based tactics.  The player controls the agent William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has his own unique abilities, but other agents are divided into the Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon classes. By entering 'Battle Focus Mode', which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to strategic positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment and abilities. As in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, soldiers will suffer from permanent death and if Carter is unable to revive agents who have taken too much damage, they will die (variable difficulty levels also determine whether or not it is possible for downed agents to become battle-ready when revived, or if replacement agents will appear during a mission).

I have to micro manage those idiots and run away manually each time an alien throws a nade, and that's really annoying.  Another game breaker is that squad members just cannot stay behind the cover. They try to attack enemies and get shot in the face. And while you can run away from grenades, can't really do anything with this thing. There should've been agressive/passive behavior for allies and also simple commands like hold ground, stay in cover, etc. As it is, The Bureau is really bad in this regard.

Maybe I'm just a sucker for the 1960s 'deniable ops' sort of feel to the game, but I've been having a blast with it.   The most common complaint that I've seen is that the AI squaddies are infants in diapers who, for some unknown reason, have been selected as the 'best of the best' -- their training manifesting as a propensity for standing in direct fire while shouting 'HALP. GIVE ME ORDERS. HALP.' They do that. It's the game's cute way of saying maybe you should actually give orders to the infants. Play the game like the tactical shooter it is and idiot AI is more than manageable throughout the engaging and (at times) brilliantly designed firefights.   As it stands, there's a lot missing from the game that would have otherwise bumped it over an 80 Metacritic score. Linear level design, a lack of base customization, poorly compressed cinematics, no laboratory research projects, and a weird combination of player/AI control over squadmates ultimately hold back what otherwise would be a stellar game.  It's still a fun game. It shines at times, albeit through occasional graphics glitches and infrequent crashes. Just don't let yourself think of how magnificent it could have been if it drew more inspiration from other XCOM games.",

The story I did enjoy but it did feel like the writers didnt quite know how to end it, I would have liked to know more about the aliens but I suppose a little mystery can be good.  The game itself I really enjoyed. It is fun to command your team and fight alongside them, I actually preferred it to the traditional xcom style, it felt like I was making more of a difference on the batlefield. When you first see a muton or a gunship appear and start advancing on you it is a rush.  It is a bit console-y, I wanted to adjust the controls more than the game allows which was a bit of a nuisance. There is some glitches that break the atmosphere and negate the need for battlefield tactics. For example, if there is a commander in cover that you need to kill - dont worry, your snipers 'critical strike' ability can shoot through walls!  Overall I would sum it up as: A flawed game, but it is fun.   Pros -Atmosphere -Squad management on battlefield and levelling is fun -Commanding squads on the battlefield is quite slick  Cons -Squad can shoot through walls so feels like your squad placement doesnt help much -Story doesnt quite work for me ",

First, this is NOT a turn-based strategy game the XCOM franchise is known for. Much of the negative reviews are from those who were misinformed about the genre. This game is a somewhat unremarkable squad shooter from a third person perspective.   Get this game if you are fascinated with the storyline of the XCOM universe. I enjoyed the progression enough to finish the game. Exploring and listening to the audio diaries is amusing and adds to the story. Much of the missions are unfortunately generic i.e. kill all enemies on the map. Main character is also deliberately unlikeable (cannot say more without story spoilers). Units you recruit are generic and easy to level up with automated side missions. You'll very quickly have a roster of forgettable squadmates you can choose from. The gameplay is rather easy overall, with occasional difficulty spikes when you aren’t doing exactly what the game expects you to.   Buy the game if you enjoy playing generic squad shooters and like the XCOM setting and more backstory. But don’t expect much. It's worth buying as a bundle with XCOM:EU since you are getting this pennies. I’d give it a 6/10.",

It shares a lot of similarites with Gears of War based on mechanics, all the same joys and ills. However, my biggest complaint with Gears, is the overly drab, too much machismo, stupidity that permeates the characters, the story and the gameplay. The sci-fi paranoia of this is much more engaging, and doesn't turn me off. The colour palette and retro feel is more refreshing, too.  Additionally, The Bureau distances itself from Gears with squad controls, and various perks. The perks are almost all fun and engaging to deploy across all the various classes, and there were a couple of missions where I just let my squad and their perks take charge. However, with every squad command game there are issues: here too, your squad will move from the cover you've placed them to freelance a bit, even if they've taken minimal fire, hopping into the open to get roasted. If they manage to survive this gambit out from cover, another issue comes into play. Whether its moving a squadmate, or deploying a perk, it must be steered across a path that a human can travel. This sometimes means you can't get your squad to quickly hop back over a wall they just jumped, and sometimes you can't trhow deployables over half walls.  Overall though, this is a very competent cover mechanic game with light squad strategies, playing somewhat similarly, but perhpas more robust than the later Mass Effects.  For those who dismiss it because it isn't XCOM, or XCOM: Enemy Unknown, you're right, it isn't, not even nearly, but that's gaming royalty, too. You'll see some familiar aliens from the franchise, and be told a decent narrative that is almost so disconnected from XCOM that it won't impact your experiences with that game either way. I say sit back, enjoy a fun, light romp through alien paranoia of the atomic age.",

In the beginning they explain how we have to reverse engineer alien stuff before being able to use it, yet in the game you can just pick up any alien blaster you find and use it right away. This hurts a lot. - there is little incentive to use different squads for different missions - squad mates stop leveling up at rank 5 which you can get to very quickly  Conclusion: 6.5/10.

Loved it!  Once my team had some abilities, the mix of a bit tactical micro managing (like in XCOM: Enemy Unknown) and shooting alien scum myself (like in... most 3rd person shooters) was great.  I loved Enemy Unknown and this is a worthy real time shooter 'conversion' of it.  While being free of bugs mostly, the game still some issues here and there (like the hellish, time consuming wandering around HQ) , but the great atmo makes it really worth the trip ;)",

It's a third-person shooter, but you can slow time to a crawl during the battle to plan your moves, give orders to your squad, and make use of your super-powers. Between missions, you can walk around the XCOM base and talk to everyone to flesh out the story (and get access to extra side-missions). It's also got some other 'RPG-lite' elements (experience points, etc.) that can give you some different gameplay depending on your choices.  The game's biggest flaw, IMO, is that the between-mission talking dragged on a little too long, and it took too long to walk around the base.  Others have commented that they didn't like the story, or that it didn't make sense to them. I actually enjoyed the story for what it was. And there's a few moral choices near the end of the game that I thought about and fretted over for a while.  I would not recommend the 'Hanger-6' DLC, since it's disjoint from the main campaign and mostly forgettable, but the other DLC mission integrates into the main campaign and it's actually a pretty fun mission.",

Only your choices in the battle field (i.e. commanding your two squad mates) have any effect on the outcome (proceding or having to repeat the mission again). The story is interesting and is what kept me playing mostly. The campaign is very long and has a somewhat satisfying resolve. Unfortunately, the story can be hard to keep track of at times and some events that should be made a bigger deal are hardly mentioned at all. The graphics are decent and I found myself getting better frame rates and visual quality in game than I did the pre-rendered cutscenes. It should be noted that I played this game before any of the other XCOM series, so my opinion is not influenced by the other games. All in all, I'd rate this game a 7.5/10.",

There are still full cover, and half cover, but it doesn't make any difference, not that I've noticed. You get shot when you peek out or when flanked anyways. So why bother.  Slow down time is cool, and a kind of throwback to original - you prepare your strategy, how to attack, what abilities to use etc, but once that first surprise attack is over, it's back to cover shootings. Trying to control the battlefield and flank the enemies rarely works as they move in real time and react to your movement. The only strategy is to shoot until they all fall down, starting from biggest threat (obviously).  However, the biggest disappointment for me is enemy variety. XCOM was always brimmed with it. Here, you have sectoids, outsiders (a bit different design - ok, whatever), muton, drone and that's it. Turns out Outsiders are main antagonists, as a whole alien race. There are technicians, psy, ghosts, elites blah blah... even bosses look just like regular foot soldiers with a bit more variety in armor. Where are chrysalids, Thin men (Which would work well in story as the ones that take human or agent form) Uber Etereal as final boss? So disappointing...  Oh, and no matter what squad mates you bring with, it always ends up with you killing the most of bad guys - so, another fail. They each have their set of abilities, and more as they level up, but rarely do they turn the tide. Maybe on highest difficulty - but what I've played, it was all about me.  Running around XCOM HQ is tiresome, conversations sequences rarely have any outcome no matter what you chose to say, and weapons go through ammo fairly quickly. You often run around looking for ammo - during the battle!  As for good things - graphics really made an impact on me. It really looks nice. The scene where alien ship exits space portal is wow, and the 60s settings is spot on. However facial impressions are bland, and lip sync is almost comical.  Story is OK, but lacks a bit more depth. No one explained to me what that thing on my arm is...  As for recommendation. Hard to say... It was disappointing, but in the end I enjoyed playing it - sort of. Maybe someone who knew nothing of XCOM before and how much potential this game had, he may view it for what it really is. 6/10",

In my opinion you are not buying this game for it's story or how cool the characters are, but if you like 3rd person shooter/ tactics, then you're going to like the gameplay atleast.  For me I found it hard to like the characters, some are very poorly made, there are very few characters that are well made,  The story.. is not that really fresh, it is kind of a cliche but the art how they mixed 60's with sci fi is great and the graphics is really something new.   It is not always about how big res you can get and having tons of details but it's also about style which actually lacks in some game industries today which some games are looking the same. not to mention C.O.D but that's a diffrent story.  And the gameplay is quite good, I really like it how they did the mechanics but still there are some areas that could have been better, perhaps some more variations of abilities and weapons.  Anyway I would give it a 5/10 a decent game, it had so much potential and could have been much better.

With the word 'X-Com', there are certain expectations, and this game meets none of them. There isn't much management, and the tactical elements becom annoying to manage during the combat, or maybe that's just me. It wants to be a shooted, but can't quite bring itself to let go of the turn-based elements, which are slightly awkwardly transferred into real-time. The characters hold water, and it felt good to be able to explore the base in person, a feature that, looking back, would've been a nice addition to Enemy Unknown.  In short, if it had just called itself 'The Bureau', and been about fighting aliens in an age when fedoras weren't a sign of a man to be avoided, it would've been a decent, if not especially great, shooter.

The AI scales ridiculously in the game, enemies that you could easily dispatch early on like sectoids would take a entire clip out of my heavy plasma gun while early game it took a few shots out of a pistol. Late game enemies seem to do insane amount of damage and are giant bullet sponges, The AI for your agents can be a bit weird if you don't give them orders (like running head on into a muton only to die instantly).

Mass Effect doesn't rely as heavily on approaching the situation from a tactical point of view. A soldier in Mass Effect can pretty much take the game on on his own.  I played this on normal and got killed several times in the last level because I didn't adapt.   That out of the way, the game has a nice atmosphere, an above average twist and some moments where I had to tip my hat ( after I picked it up ) to the developer.  The atmosphere is nicely done, although the aliens somewhat lack the attention to detail. Don't get me wrong, they're pretty well done, but their structures do get rather bland.  I realize that this might be intentional, seeing their purpose, but a little eyecandy would have been neat.  Same goes for the weapons, they feel convincing and go fwoosh instead of bang - but they lack spirit. They feel very much like the guns from Saints Row IV.   The guns all feel powerful and you can play with the M1911 and the M14 almost all the way to the end, which is somewhat surprising - but nice. It isn't necessary to drop your favorite just because there is an upgrade/ alternative to it, at least not for a very long time.  The M1911 sounds awesome. The M14, sadly, does not.   Also, does anyone know what else is affected by PhysX Cloth? I only saw the directors tie move, and not very convincingly at that. Is there something I'm missing?",

That being said, this is an X-COM game so tactical control should be expected. I played the game on the next difficulty up from normal and found it challenging at times. At these times you really do have to use yours and your squads abilities strategically to come out on top which definitly gives you satisfaction when everything all goes to plan.

            "review_text": "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified isn't bad, it just isn't very good. It's a bit threadbare, feeling like several incomplete ideas that have been rushed out the gate.  Realistically, I suspect The Bureau was completed on a small-ish budget after lingering around in development hell for a few years. Something about the game makes it feel like it's ten years or more old, if it wasn't for some of the DirectX 11 effects looking so sparkly it'd be easy to think it was from the early 2000's. Many of the locations are bare and empty places, feeling like they've been built in a rush, and often with several such vacant sets stitched together without any combat or events to distract, assumably to give the impression of covering a lot of ground in a mission. Other areas have clearly had some time and attention spent on them, and the locations and missions waver back-and-forth on this attention / quality scale, leaving the experience feeling quite jarring. You'll wander from a well-realised street, strewn with debris, bodies and signs of previous life... into an area that feels like it's been imported from a PS2 game.  The mechanics of the game basically play out like Mass Effect's combat, or Mass Effect 3 more specifically. It's a cover-based shooter where you run around with two squadmates, you have abilities with cooldowns, can issue orders and give movement directions to your squad. Enemies come in multiple varieties, some with shields and some with armour, with a few enemy types creating interesting tactical choices (a unit that supplies shields to all other nearby units, for example, if taken out the shields drop and make the fight easier). Unfortunately, where Mass Effect shines in making you care for your squad, here they are just flat cardboard bodies waiting for you to pull their puppet strings. They also keep respawning in front of you whenever you cross through a 'loading door' (frequent area transitions where the game loads the next section as your character very slowly opens a door and looks left and right before giving you control again), which is a bit distracting.  In fact, I felt the game lacked polish in general. I fell through the level geometry and died twice in eight hours of play, once whilst just running down a straight corridor. Audio logs can be found and played, although walking away from them they fade until inaudible (if I have to stand still to listen to them, they may as well be written text!). The controls aren't terrible, but movement feels clunky and stiff, for example; when you run there is absolutely no strafing, not even in a limited fashion, leaving you to clumsily course-correct with your mouse as you charge forward. You also tend to pop in and out of cover randomly at times, especially if strafing in cover, and controlling your squadmates feels awkward (fortunately the game slows down time during this).  Much of the story is told over radio as you run between fights, although there are some cutscenes that deal with exposition. The game also uses a dialogue wheel, just like the Mass Effect series, allowing you to choose between being vaguely rude or agreeable, it's a nice enough touch, although it felt a bit redundant with such small scope for actual meaningful choice. Levels are basically linear paths that open into combat arenas, the main missions last 30 to 60 minutes each, with side missions from 15 to 30 minutes roughly (I only did a couple, they felt fairly pointless). The game isn't overly long with six main missions, the story is mildly amusing with some interesting characters (although the main player character really started to grate on me). The plot felt like it tried to raise the stakes too high a number of times implying that Earth has basically been wiped out and already lost by the midway point of the game, then later claiming it's not as bad as implied, which breaks the suspension of disbelief somewhat.  Imbetween the missions, the game flirts with the idea of being an XCOM-style strategy game where you pick missions and kit out your squad, but with only six main plot missions and (I believe) seven side-quest 'minor missions', it doesn't feel like there's a lot of variety or choice. The equipment feels limited, with only a handful of weapons to equip and the only other equipment slot being a 'backpack' which acts as a kind of modifier for ammo, health regen, or ability cooldowns.  Overall, not a bad game, just not a particularly good one. It feels like it didn't succeed at being the mixture of genres it wanted to be, and it's not particularly good at being any ONE genre either. The plot is so-so, and the clunky and unpolished feel doesn't help. But if you don't mind all this and want a simple squad and cover-based shooter, this might entertain.",

When i saw it being compared to mass effect i was intrigued, but ultimately i was left frustrated by gameplay mechanics that are at odds with each other. The Bureau wants you to use its squad command system so much, yet stacks all the odds against you by forcing you down a linear corridor of cramp combat areas with practically zero room to make any worthwhile tactical decisions. Even when you attempt to move your AI partners to flank an enemy, half the time they just get downed almost instantly by pinpoint accurate enemy fire. Add to that horrible weapons with small ammo capacity yet a LAUGHABLY abundant amount of ammo crates littered across the battlefield. The combat is just not fun in ANY way, shape, or form.  It's a real shame because the story seemed to be pretty decent (minus the completely lifeless and uninteresting generic squad mates), but i just could not bring myself to push forward.

If you're going for achievs, this is an easy game to get them all in... The only other time I would suggest this game is if you're a HUGE fan of XCOM and you NEED the lore. 5/10  Long Review  Alright, this game is rough. It's like the developers of Mass Effect wiped their ♥♥♥ with the extra funding they had from the ME series, and churned out a ♥♥♥♥ show of a game called The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. This. Is. Rough. The worst part is, you can often times see the potential this game has. It's a game that WANTS to be good, WANTS to be a fan service... But it falls flat so, so early. The main character is a boring, rude, monotone agent who constantly bounces between 'caring', and 'shut up, we have a job to do'. His 'personality' actually adds to the overall failure of this game, I feel. The cover system is atrocious. You are either super glued to your cover, or you can't get into cover, on a game solely based around Third-Person Cover Shooting. Like I said, Mass Effect with a pennies worth of funding. That gets really infuriating when you're on the highest difficulty and some of the enemies advance to flank you, and you're bashing the multitude of buttons to get off cover and nothing is happening. The abilities are boring and unimagitive... Once again, comparing to Mass Effect, they pretty much ripped off the abilities. Lift, Pulse Wave, Weaken... Jeeeeeeeeeeeez. The guns are all boring, with little personality in each one. I could beat the game using the M1911 pistol, to be honest, since it seems to deliver one hell of a headshot. In fact, most of the guns feel like they do NOTHING. You're tickling a Sectoid with your Scatter Laser. wat. Running around the HQ QUICKLY becomes tedious. You have to run back and forth, back and forth, etc. etc.   Pros: XCOM Lore A nice 'old school' feeling... They did somewhat decent on that Interesting view into some of the aliens Killing an alien every now and then results in some funny physics Decent graphics and audio  Cons: Terrible controls Boring abilities and guns Tedious legwork in the HQ Sticky or repelling cover Repetitive gameplay to the maaaaaaaax. Trying out new guns, new squaddies, or new ability combos don't add at to the experience at all.   Go play XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, or any of the older XCOM's. They'll probably offer the same lore in a different style, and they will actually be good.",

Update: As of recent patches,the game is now completely broken. What was once bad is made worse as it now lags and cracks and stutters all over. Really,don't buy this game unless you enjoy torturing yourself with everything that could concievably go wrong.",

I had such high hopes for this game that I preordered it, picturing tactical combat against all the classic X-Com enemies. Basically, I wanted to be the soldiers I was sending to their doooms in Enemy Unknown. What I got was basically all the most boring parts of Mass Effect's combat system, and a story that couldn't be more forgettable. Combat isn't tactics, it's patience. It is incredibly hard to die, and if you do your completely replaecable squadmates will usually be able to revive you. Enemies take forever to die, most boss fights devolving into you running around looking for ammo as your teammates slowly tick down their gigantic health bars. The ability to customize your companions is very limited, you can only change their guns and add an enhancement item that reduces damage, cooldowns, etc. Oh, and you can change the color of their suits.   The story doesn't make you feel any sort of emotion, it's just Mission X and Agent Y, mixed with a 60's thematic and sci-fi cliches. The X-Com headquarters is kind of neat, but once you realize there is nothing to do there it loses some charm. Maybe it gets better in the last third of the game, but I have a hard time believing dessert will be excellent after spooning down so much gruel.   As I said, I was very high on this game based on the trailers and the excellence of its strategy counterpart, but there is nothing in the execution of this title that backed up that promise. Of my 6 hours, I don't think I had fun for more than 5-10 minutes, and I don't think I will ever play it again. I bought it at ~50 dollars, and a month later it was on sale for 19.99. That is not an accident.",

I wanted to love this game. I really, really did. I love the other X-com with a passion; and this game truly could have been great.   It is not.   Everything about this game is just...dull. The dialogue is dry and predictable. The main character is as basic, sullen, and gloomy as you can get. Everything about this game is a stereotype.   The gameplay is repetitive and boring. It's basically just go somewhere, shoot 70 aliens, go home. In the other X-com, it was an accomplishment to take down 10 aliens with a 6 member team. In this game, you're regularly taking down 50 or more with 3 people. There's really not much strategy to it, either. Your teammates are dumb and require constant instructions on where to go, and you'll find yourself more often than not just going to do everything yourself, because it's faster. It tries to incorporate a little bit of strategy by allowing you to do extra damage via flanking your enemies, but that's about as deep as it gets.   Overall, this is dull, uninspired, and feels like a B-movie version of the worst Mass Effect game. Even saying that feels like I'm giving it too much credit.",

It has no drawback, where the others are, less damage for more ability uses. Destroy armor on armored targets, but less range of ability. Disable enemy shields, but less ammo. They are just pointless to use any other backpack. There aren't enough armoured enemies to make them actually a challenge and there is always a rocket launcher convenently placed. Also, the plasma pistol DLC is basically a hand held cannon, no point in usung anything else till late game, even then... Shield enemies are easy to take out, there was no real challenge to the game. You and your guys become immoirtal when reviving somebody, which them getting knocked down isn't all that often.  One cut scene had you get knocked out, only to be picked up by the ehad scientist and the leader.

Nothing made any sense about being dropped off or picked up after battles, and the poor attempt at having dialogue between fights is so poor and they are so far apart it seems it is done just to add play time.

            "review_text": "This game is a practice in strangely borrowed and hybridized mechanics, and an endearing yet offput spinoff of the franchise.  First and foremost, if you're a fan of XCOM for its tactical gameplay, this isn't your game. All of the combat is cover-based third-person shooter, and real time apart from the time-slowing assess mode which allows you to give commands to your 2 squadmates, and carefully select combat skills. I liken the combat greatly to Mass Effect, decidedly more clunky, and with an oddly bloated crosshair -- as if UI designers expected I'll forget where my gun is pointing.  From a franchise and lore point of view, the game takes place during the Cold War with a 'Noir' theme, harkening back known alien scum like the sectoids and mutons (which are actually scary to fight now, especially on a higher difficulty) and brings forth some new flavors, including a new take on the squaddie-slaying Sectopod. However, being put into the odd 'shadow war' that they are is a bit lop-sided and obviously noncanonical in comparison to the other XCOM games where invasion is clearly apparent, and you are the first and last line of Earth's defense. Technological advances are also not particularly as 'exciting' and the taken-for-granted nature of them from first mission of the game and there on breaks the 'immersing' factor of getting new toys.  Two very specific peeves of mine are; 1. There is no manual saving. You hop between checkpoints throughout the entire game, and this harms the unpremeditated whims of playing it. This can also lead to going through cut scenes, dialogue, and entire 'homebase intervals' than you already just went through. 2. Squadmates are finicky in cases, with AI that needs to be babysat routinely. They do not comprehend the sense of not poking their head out while under enemy suppression (which can lead to them quickly losing non-regenerable health), they do not use their skills of their own accord (yet perhaps for the better with their AI), and in my experience, have occasionally 'forgot' orders to hold ground while I'm trying to cover their flank, and are very dodgey with taking out targets you mark them to attack.  I intend to still play it now and then, because it has a few elements from Mass Effect that I enjoy (including dialogue wheels) but I'd never recommend it to someone who is a fan of other XCOM games.",

I suppose an upside is that they don't re-use the same names all the time. Yes I'm looking at you Prince of Persia. Which one? ♥♥♥♥ed if I knew.  So XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a top-down RTS where you have six soldiers and can make your own guns to take into- What? Wrong game? We're talking about the other one? Alright...  So The Bureau: XCOM Declassified -and yes I have to copy and paste that name every time because it's about as long and complicated as your relationship as your recent sexual partner- is a third person shooter where you can take two brain dead ♥♥♥♥♥ and pick up any gun that seems to have the coolest 'pew pew' sounds off the ground. Can I go back to the other XCOM now? No? Another six paragraphs? Alright...   So you play as Jimmy Raynor- I mean William Carter who, similarly to Raynor, wears Clichés like he picked up a pile suits made of them at a cheap clothes store and decided to smother himself in them because he didn't wake up dapper enough that morning. His family was murdered, which explains the clothes shop, and he is now haunted by it because of course he is. He must have obtained his grizzly-♥♥♥♥ voice by drinking their liquefied corpses. Well, You're supposed to feel sympathy for them but you never have any reason to. I once turned to a friend and say one of his lines in his grizzly as hell voice , but that line could have come anywhere, say... Batman.  The story is that Carter made out with this alien chick, probably a bit too rough though, and it turns out that his box of clichés went missing, and the alien chick probably took them to have a little gander. So he goes on a mystical adventure to re-obtain them but is interrupted and escorted by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to this Bureau that Carter has never heard about, and pretends doesn't exist, but just like mass effect, everyone sees you as some kind of war hero, and treat you as god, despite you having no idea what the hell is going on.   Similar to Mass Effect, you have a choice in what you want to say, with awkward eye-contact, but unlike mass effect, there is not good or evil options, which I suppose is good, so you don't have to decide whether you want to be good, bad, or in the middle which gets you no-♥♥♥♥ing-where. But you also aren't talking to party members with interesting back stories, you talk to random ♥♥♥♥♥ in suits.   What the ♥♥♥♥ is with all the suits? Why is everyone in a suit during an alien invasion. Should they not be in armour? Let's put it this way, aliens invade, like they do, and everyone was too busy looking dapper and thought it looked cool. Are they ironically being hipsters? Got'ta wear a suit. Every other game wears armour, so we have to wear suits because we're posh and ♥♥♥♥. Then again, it does make a nice change from dressing up in skulls, pots and pans such as in, say, Borderlands.  Maybe I should actually talk about the combat, as that's the only thing that hasn't been terrible so far. So the combat is hopefully good while everything else is quite lackluster.  Pahahaha! Good is it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! The AI are about as smart as mother chickens. Something, let's say... A cardboard cut out of a cat lobbed a grenade, the AI yells 'Grenade!' then sort of sits on it, aiming to keep it warm and birth a baby chicken because no one else would want a child with them, and then they wonder after about five awkward seconds of me yelling they wonder why their brains are against the wall.   So the AI is ♥♥♥♥ed. What about the guns? Well unlike Unknown COM Enemy X you don't make your own weapons from scrap, or research, or days of sitting outside the engineering bay staring at it, and then when it's done you dress it up in a bow tie. and throw a birthday party, and then use it in the field and fan girl about how awesome it is. But in XCOM Bureau Declassified The, you jus sortof find it. Which completely goes against anything in XCOM, where in other games the alien weaponry self destruct so you can't use it.  Oh, but don't worry. There's still the regular SMG, Shotgun, Pistol, sniper ect. But there is no special slot for the pistol to go, and you can only hold two guns at a time which feels like Duke Nukem Forever. Euugh! I just thought of Duke Nukem forever, thank you XCOM Declassified Bureau The.  Speaking of the pistol, it's completely pointless other than for precision head shotting that do ♥♥♥♥ all within Bureau XCOM The Declassified as enemies have so much health you might as well fire BB pellet's at their powderizd uterus. Though the pistol reminds me of Tomb Raider's combat. The new one that is, not the old one. I'm reminded of it due to the way you can sit behind a chest high wall and make a nice sized hole in their head. Or uterus.   Oh ♥♥♥♥ me how have I not mentioned chest &lt;dry heave&gt; chest high walls. The game puts chest high walls -or cars- anywhere that there is some kind of combat. Even if you had to swat a fly, suddenly chest high walls fall from space and crush the fly that you were fighting. Thanks a ♥♥♥♥ing lot now get out my game. When you try to move on, carter just cello tapes to any wall that he happens to subtly brush past, as if he's scared of the next room, or he's trying to tell you something but he's a man of cliché's and can't be arsed. Oh, but when you actually do enter combat he refuses to stick to the damn wall.   On multiple occasions I exited a cut scene, which threw me into combat, I ran at a wall, He swiftly avoided it and straight into open, and got gunned down. So I then turned around, in attempt to get to the wall, and he ran straight past it again and dropped dead. So my partners panicked, and tried to revive me by running in the complete opposite direction and get headshot.  All in all, my favourite part of the game was that at the end you have to go on a suicide mission with the chosen one- What? Wrong game? I was talking about the XCOM: Enemy Unknown? Sorry, I was playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown, It's a top-down RTS that 2K gave us while threatening to make this garbage- oh no The Bureau has gone playing with the birds again.

Upgrades do not reflect weapon tech level (bullets, laser, then plasma), where as soldiers can, at the start when you only have the starting weapons, have tech for, say, a turret, that uses tech based off of the alien's weapons. Any and all choices you make (and side missions) will have 0, repeat, 0 impact on the story, as (SPOILIER) X-Com HQ eventually gets attacked and destroyed, killing virtually everyone inside of the base save for some major characters. The whole idea of 'having to take alien weapons that haven't been destroyed by operator death using the Venn Brace (the device on Carter's arm in virtually all screen shots)' is just stupid. The AI isn't the brightest. The game also lacks a key aspect of X-Com and it's choices: will this work out in the long run.  Lets use X-Com: Enemy Unknown for example: You recieve an abduction mission. You have to pick one of three. One is in St. Petersburg, and Russia is offering a new sniper, at the rank of captian. Your's is a squaddie, as you had to replace your previous one. Then there's one in New York. The US is offering 4 scientists. You have completed all projects that will be fast, and are on a long term one (10 days left). Then you have one in Cairo. Egypt is offering 200 credits. You recently bought a satilite, and still have room for one more. Europe and NA has their panic raised to 2, amd if you don't pick it, it will raise to 4, hanging on the edge of full panic and risking leaving, or staying. The sattilite construciton is cutting the montly report close, but you may have time to place that sattilite over the one of the paniced countries. And there MAY be a chance of a Terror mission. What I have given you is a typical scenario, in both EU and EW. The player may think this: 'That sniper is good, it can make my squads stronger, and I don't have to worry about my normal sniper becoming wounded. But, I need those Scientists so I can research Plasma weapons faster, make my soldiers better in the field. Although, I could use those funds, and can use two sattilites to lower more countries panic.' For this, there is no right or wrong answer. And there is a chance that this can make or break your run.  However, for the Bureau, there are no hard choices. You can do as many side missions, and send as many side agents out before you continue on with the story. The even added a cliche 'character sacrifice' on the finally mission, (SPOILER) having you pick between Agent Weaver, Director Faulke, or Doctor Weir (depending on who you picked to continue as in the level prior). There is no sense of loss, as you can't even use the character you just rescuesed, esentially giving you a hollow choice.  This game was labeled an X-Com game and had potential. It did not live up to it.",

            "review_text": "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is the imagination of a classic series of turn based strategy games as a first person shooter. The game begins in Pima, New Mexico where strange happenings are afoot and suddenly a coordinated alien strike disrupts global communications, supply lines, etc. The Bureau is an over-the-shoulder shooter with a “time-slow” button that allows the player to give commands to their squad. Those who have played the Mass Effect games … the combat is exactly like Mass Effect.  The Good: The fights in this game a pretty fun. Good battlefield layout made for lots of fun fights as you slip from cover to cover. Further, the ability to move your squaddies and deploy skills and hardware gave a neat strategic over lay that made the game more than just a “shoot-em-in-the-head-over-and-over” fest (in lower difficulties).  The Bad: Sadly, everything else is ranging from not good to terrible. The entire game is one long hall way; there’s never two ways to a fight, a way around a fight, etc. The story … well dang, I am honor bound to never spoil anything no matter how good or how bad I think the writing may be. That said I’ll be interested to talk to someone else who’s played this to see if the whole last 10% of the game was actually as bad as it seemed of it is super wonderful and I’m just a dope and didn’t get it … IDK, not worth playing again to find out. The voice acting is mediocre at best and the tech-tree (or extreme lack thereof) is downright offensive to anyone who’s played the older X-Com games (there is no tech tree, you find a weapon just sitting there and pick it up … yours now). The game is also SO comically straight forward that you almost have to avoid the “secrets” since they are mostly shiny things at the end of short hallways, like … you can nearly see them from the main rout! Just in case you actually did miss anything the stuff in these “secret” passages you can take comfort in that it is either ammo you didn’t need or a gear schematic that they game will give you later. This game also commits the cardinal sin of game difficulty: enemies get more HP and do more damage / run a head-shot script per level of difficulty which turns the game into a “shoot-em-in-the-head-over-and-over” fest.   The Funny: The game was also not bug free which, when games are bad, can be nice since it serves as comic relief. I fell through the floor of places I was walking toward twice and once the camera locked onto my face and didn’t move after dialog. The combat raged on and I proceeded to just sit there, adoring the main characters steely grimace while getting gunned down for being out of cover. OH! Whether or not you play the game though, be sure to look up the commercials! The marketing for this game was more fun than the entire game! Seriously, the stuff they did on Twitter and small webisodes and such were SUPERB! The marketing people for this deserve to be on much better projects that’s for sure! I’d hire then in a snap!  The Summary: I give this game 5 out of 10. It’s not quite as bad as when they made Shadowrun into FPS but this is pretty bad. Think of a game like Chess. We know it as a game where strategy and a careful, mistake free execution are keys to success. Then take the strategy out and let all the chess pieces run anywhere they want and shoot! That’s what you get when you turn a game like X-Com into an FPS. If you want to sit down and shoot at aliens for a few hours while you watch TV and the game is on Steam-sale for 5 bucks or less you won’t kick yourself for picking up a copy, I’ll give it that. With all the good titles out there though I can’t imagine anyone so hard up for something to do that this would be a good buy. The fights are fun if ya like a quick shoot-em-up but that’s all I can say. Thank God Sid Meyers got the rights to this game as well and made a FANTASTIC turn based strategy X-Com; that is everything X-Com should have been! GET THAT ONE INSTEAD!",

It's not so much the story itself, the idea of alien invasion is obviously a solid trope that the XCOM theory thrives on. But it's handled in such a ham-fisted and clunky way. The 1960's is a brilliant setting for a game like this, but they just never make the most of it. - The main character. Another Scotch-soaked haunted soul with a shocking past... *yawn*. - The voice acting (and facial animation) is pretty poor. - The combat is bought wholesale from the Mass Effect series but it seems like they only played Mass Effect 1 (where they hadn't really perfected it yet). It tries to cram a lot of the tactical elements from XCOM: Enemy Unknown in a real-time experience, again it's clumsy as hell. - It really doesn't run all that well, I'm way above the recommended settings and there are certain parts of the environment that make the framerate tank.

The whole thing tries to be too serious, with a cliched gruff-voiced and angry main character to boot. No matter how interesting the asthetic of the game may be, the terrible story will always get in the way.  Initially enjoyable tactical shooting action gives way to frustration; no matter how much you plan and scheme, your brain-dead teammates will wander in front of ALL the bullets (there's friendly fire, for some reason). All of the humans have extremely shallow health, and while most of the enemies do too, you will quickly find yourself fighting armored units. The armored units have huge life bars, and are often supported by waves of alien enemies capable of throwing many, many gernades to force you and your team out of cover to be shot down (your teammates will NEVER throw gernades).  The worst aspect of this game is the permadeath; once one of your teammates dies, they're gone. Your team is your strength; several times when I was attacked by armored units and aliens, my ability to survive was linked to how long my teammates could avoid running into bullets. Despite thier stupidity, your human teammates each have thier own unique powers and abilities that must be effectively untilized. The abilities of the player and team increase with new levels, meaning you may be crippling yourself if you go into battle with low level characters. Someone looking for a challenging/frustrating tactical shooting experience may get something out of this game. All others avoid.

And that's the only thing that kept me going.  It's pretty much X-com in the cold war era. Cobbled together technologies mixed with traditional weaponry (and no combat armor???) make a story that seems like it's a giant under reaction to an alien invasion while at the same time being weirdly preprepared for it all.  The enemies will seem partially familiar to X-Com Enemy Unknown players, but the story won't really make sense. The technologies seem very different than Enemy Unknown and the style of warfare entirely alien to that storyline.

It's decidedly better than Enforcer (though it does make me wonder if Alliance would have been bad) and at times it tries really hard to be a good game, but several glaring flaws come close to ruining it altogether for me. First, the movement is a bit awkward. I played the game clear through on the hardest difficulty and I never could master the controls on it. Combat was alright. Nothing special as far as tactical shooters go but the AI's movement felt pretty well natural with my squad even giving enough space to avoid the entire team being wiped by a single grenade (most of the time). What almost kills the game for me though is the dialog and 'choices' in the game. I don't know if it's a bug or just bad writing but throughout the game the choices I made seemed to be ignored for a standard plot line. Spoiler:   For instance, I saved Nico and helped him recover from the sleeper virus but repeatedly he is referred to by other characters as if he had died. Honestly, I don't even see how saving him had any real impact on the game or story.   Additionally, the dialog jumps as characters will use a term or reference an event that they haven't heard yet or wouldn't have known which breaks any chance at becoming immersed in the game. Beyond that, I'm at a loss for where this game fits in with the XCOM universe. I honestly think that after hearing the game pitch, someone at Take2 said, 'Hey, cool alien invasion game idea. You know what, we have the XCOM license, let's slap that on for some extra sales.' It's the only explanation I can come up with that doesn't place this game into a different universe as Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within due to inconsistencies in plot lines, how different certain species are portrayed from one to the next, and no feigned attempt at explaining why we don't start Enemy Within with plasma guns and UFO technology.  Despite the flaws, I don't regret the purchase. I would be highly selective on which friends I'd recommend it to since it will take a forgiving player to like the game and even then I'd say wait till it's on sale. Since I can't recomment it to the general public, I have to give this game a thumbs down.  Edit: A quick note, I have an older machine and the core game played fine with the physX stuff turned off, but the DLC was unplayable for me as it used a different set of shaders on the enemies that caused the framerate to drop to unplayable unplayable levels.",

The first mission takes too long and the game ends up holding your hand for your first few hours of gametime, when all you want to do is be able to get rid of the tutorials and everything else. The voices are great though, with only a few complaints. The gameplay.. Alright, well, if you're looking for a Mass Effect type third-person shooter, here you go. If you're looking for something new and inventive, sucks to be you (I was that person. I was very mad.) The game also heavily holds your hand in the gameplay itself, with tutorials harrassing you non-stop and.. GOSH DARNIT THAT MUTON BOSSFIGHT.

They run around like chickens with their heads cut off, do not stick to cover, an they do not hunker down &amp; avoid enemy fire when near death, so I'm constatnly reviving them. You can not do anything yourself because the moment you start doing something you hear 'help help I'm dying'.  Missions either go rather smoothly or you fail instantly the moment your guys start dying, it's like a puzzle on how to put them somewhere where they do what they are told.  I'm playing on veteran difficulty, yet I can literally take on the entire alien army myself, it's my squad that makes me fail. Once you get your squad up in stats an get near half way into the game your squad actually starts behaving properly like they did during the first part of the game, so what the heck was going on? The game plays well at the beginning, then horribly beyond belief, then ok again. Seems like it's buggy level design in the first part.

O, an the conversation mechanics with NPC's is most assurdadly Mass Effect, I'm thinking this is either the Mass Effect game redone or they did that deliberately.   Play if you are a hardcore Xcom fan, if you are not an want similar gameplay, try Mass Effect or Star Wars Republican Commando.   PS, The game does an typical gaming sin, skippable cutscense in the middle of gameplay which of course we all know means you'll accidently skip them because you are pushing buttons frantically during play. At the VERY last mission at the end of the game, there is a cutscene with key information on how to finish the game, sadly I skipped it accidentaly an died when swarmed with mutons.

The gameplay and structure is reminiscent of the Mass Effect games: You start in a base, pick a mission from a map, grab two followers and go on a third person cover-shoot with light tactical squad elemets. Damage on the field is like XCOM: done based on the kind of cover the enemy is in, meaning unless you can get a head shot it is necessary to flank enemies in order to effectively dispatch them.   This all sounds fine in theory, the problem is execution. The game does not have the interactive story elements of Mass Effect, nor the interesting characters. Squad-mates taken on missions are randoms with no personality, meaning they are little more than a set of skills accumulated throughout the game. If they die, they're dead forever and trying to level a new squadie late game is tantamount to suicide since they can't take more than a couple of hits. Their AI is questionable at the best of times: Orders to do a flanking manoeuvre typically result in them making a B-line across an open killzone and if you move too far from them, they break cover and jog directly back to you, regardless of circumstance. This forces you to micro-manage them constantly as you can't trust them with even the most basic of orders.   Admittedly Mass Effect doesn't handle these combat elements much better but it gives your character more personal power to handle combat situations whereas The Bureau strips you of them. Mass Effect makes using your allies and their questionable AI an option while The Bureau makes it a necessity without compensating the decision, punishing you with perma-death if you attempt to get creative or if the AI spazes out.   The story is OK on it's own but as an XCOM prequel it makes no sense and ends with an unsatisfying meta-element which I won't spoil. The initially charming 50's low-tech setting becomes bland as tile sets are frequently reused and gives way to generic alien ship backdrops.  Mass Effect distracts you from it's inadequacies with a more complete package of interesting characters, interactions and locations. If it didn't have these things it would only be a semi-competent cover shooter, which is what The Bureau is.",

The story is a lot of talking that I fell asleep in. So I know nothing else about this game.  The gameplay is very cool though, mixing a third person shooter with a strategy styled movement. Of course, third person is self explantory, you shoot and move, but the other part is to move your squad members to flanking positions, and places where you'd get the advantage in the fight. Every class, has a different ability. May it be, cloaking or firing strike, they all play differently. Yet the gameplay gets boring and generic, not many guns, not much fun.   The graphics in this game are pretty decent, I believe they run the same engine as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but I've never played Enemy Unknown.

Looks like the game was made by someone who never understood what made the originals fun games to play. And when will developers stop trying to shove ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI sidekicks down our throats? How do the meetings go when the idea is pitched for this game feature? Do they all really think that they are going to succeed where 99% of all other developers have failed? Only time AI sidekicks come close to working is when their scenes are entirely scripted or they have infinitely health. Neither of those are true in this game. The game would have been better if it was a commando style game with one agent trying to pass each mission, since the AI does not listen to you when you tell it to stay put. It runs out into fire, gets shot, lays their bleeding, and leaves the rest of the mission for you to complete.",

Now I have a totally new Mac Pro with all hi-end staff inside it and the game still runs as ♥♥♥♥ even with medium configuration. Moreover, some key don't work in the game and also it hangs. U know, probably I'm just a guy who has a bad mood today and that's why so dissapointed. But I think it's a shame to screw up with XCom series no matter OSX/Win/console u'r makeing it for. Test it better then. Or just don't move to production at all. Some of modern game companies are just moneymakers and do not care to make people feel comfortable with their product by spend more money and time to adopt them for all systems where they sell their products. Gimme my money back, I don't want to support such products as XCom Bureau. Let's imagine I've never played it and won't keep it in my memory as a part of XCom brand.  P.S. and damn Steam, why Cmd+Left/Right shortcuts move you back and forward in history while I'm typing a message? Have to type it twice and u override a standard OS behaviour.",

The atmosphere was good and there were some really good parts, but the story ended up being convulted and the gameplay was awkward, with average shooting mechanics, clumsy ordering system and little tactical depth (on squaddie dificulty) or non-intuitive controls that constantly got in the way (on veteran difficulty).  Overall, you could buy it on salw, because it is quite fun, but definetely not recomented",

The bad: Choppy story-line, half the time it's hard to tell up from down in this, the equipment is severely lacking cons (Sure, a pack that lowers your health in exchange your abilities CD is a lot lower, but other than that... nothing), the AI is stupid (Really makes a bad teammate on a co-op seem nice), the places your find upgrades are not hard to find, and sometimes the landscape refuses to work with you.  Play it once, then drop it, is my recommendation. It's a one-way road that can be walked down in 10 hours.",

The Bureau takes on another approach than the other games, which is interesting. However, I feel like that the challenges in this game appeared at the wrong places. Research is not a thing in this game, you just get upgrades 'for free' as you progress through the game. It almost feels like it comes to easy compared to the other XCOM games. The challenge instead is to keep your team mates in order. The AI of the team mates is really terrible. Terrible to the extent that I have stopped playing the game. It becomes such a choir to keep them under control that you can not really be effective in a fight. Even if you put like 95% focus on trying to keep your team mates alive, at some point you may have to relocate yourself because enemys are closing in, or flanking you, and instantly that leaves your team mates unattended for long enough for them to run out of the cover your ordered them to stay in and run straight up to the most dangerous enemy and die - rendering them impossible to revive. Because if you run out there yourself you are dead as well. However, you need the team mates that you have invested time in levelling up and unlocking skills for. Sm it's a deadlock.  IMO opinion the stupidity of AI is a game breaker and I grown so tired of it that I don't know if I will ever finish this game. I stopped playing 8 hours in to the game and have been unable to motivate myself to continue for about 3 weeks now.  To this end, I can not recommend it. It's nice with variation from the other XCOM games, I like the atmosphere and the looks of the game. But the AI is, like I said, a game breaker.",
