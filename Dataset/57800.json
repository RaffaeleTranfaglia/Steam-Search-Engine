            "review_text": "Pros: - Half-cynical humour provided by your bag. - Fun to fly around once you get the parts to do it.  Cons: - Physics can be unpredictable. - You can get 'locked' in place by the environment. - If you fall a few feet too far you die.  The back-wind-mechanic is pretty much /unstuck since you will no doubt again and again be wedged between different objects, get knocked over by one of your wheels, fall down somewhere, have your vehicle roll of a cliff because you're too slow to go after it...  Putting the vehicle together is a pain as the arm can't quite place them as you'd want - the physics doesn't allow you to place wheels underneath the seat. For short, the developer solution was that you can theoretically put everything 'inside' the seat, with just a bit sticking out, and it will still work.  The game took about 2 hours for me to beat, and then there was a lot of stubborn-ness in not wanting to rebuild the vehicle, since it's always a pain.  It had great promise and was enjoyable to some extent (thus why it was finished to the end) but all of the hassling around the physics makes me not able to really recommend the game. Took me a week to beat it since I couldn't stand playing it for too long at a time.  Played 'casually', one level or so at a time or 10 minutes at a time... sure. You can save and quit at any point. Just don't expect an all-over enjoyable experience.",

            "review_text": "To be honest, I despise this game. I can't complain because I was given this for free so I really didn't waste money, I wasted time. The is a puzzle game with a great art style. In the beginning of the game they help you so much, but as soon as you get to level 2 the tips, help, and arrows that point you to the objective are gone. This frustrated me a lot. Thinking I'm going the correct led me to a death pit. When I am going the right way it takes be 30 mins +. I don't maybe I'm not good at puzzle games. Verdict, first 1 hour was great, vibrant colors, characters personality, and creativity glued me to the game until I hated it 5 hours later. This is my opinion and I suggest only buy it if you outstanding at puzzle games and have a lot of patience (you'll die alot). The game sells for $5, if you are going to buy it, buy it on sale.",

When he adds the final part to the machine, his refigerator/toaster/barbeque grill, he is shot more than 2000 years into the future.  Then you walk around slowly and read horrible text in a god-awful speech-bubble setup. It thinks it's a puzzle game, but it's really a slow platformer that doesn't have a jump button.  Terribad, man.",
