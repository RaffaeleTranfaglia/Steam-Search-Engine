            "review_text": "This game needs work. Unfortunately it is being compared to Vanishing Realms which is a lot to live up to as one of the top games on the vive. I'm very interested to see this go further, but things needs to be fixed before it goes anywhere.  1. Combat needs reworking. Swords feels floaty, specially the first sword you get. The flame one for some reason feels better.  2. Both sword and shield suffer from getting stuck on the environment. 3. One of the biggest problems and frustration was the game not always blocking attacks with the shield. 4. I'm not a fan of the blackout screen when getting hit. I think a flash of red would work better. 5. Teleporting needs work. I'm not sure the reason behind charging to teleport. It just doesn't seem fluid. 6. Lastly, i found interesting that when you die, the game asks you to press F5 to retry. This is a room scale vr game not played with a keyboard. It breaks the immersion if you have to take off the headset to go to your keyboard.   On the plus side, it has great graphics and environment so far and it's not another wave shooter.",

Weapons look good and dont go through walls and objects :) Its free but worth more than a lot of other vr games on steam.  For feedback to the devs: 1, Can you please add vibration when the sword &amp; shield make contact. 2, Abillity to hide the heads up display.  ",

Occasionally you might teleport behind enemies to do some complex maneuver but they will immediately spin around so don’t bother with that. If the combat ever improves I might give this a good rating but since combat is most of the game I would recommend not bothering with this one unless you are really bored.",

All in all, I'd still recommend it, but there's still work to be done on smoothing out the experience.",

I was hoping this was it, or the tech demo for it, but it's just Vanishing Realms' swordfighting gameplay with more 'realism' and less polish. Recommended, but only because it's free for people who don't want to spend $20 for Vanishing Realms.  Oh, and enemies kept spawning behind me, and the teleportation cooldown got kind of old.",

            "review_text": "So after trying this game out, i wanted to provide some feedback to others/developers.   Good bits-    Graphics look very good and the modelling/animation of enemies and the level are very impressive.    Enemies are actually scary to fight and that *Small Spoiler*  big horned dude   scared the shhh out of me   The teleport mechanic has a small charge which stops spamming which i think is a good idea.   The upgrades look awesome and feel rewarding.   *TINY SPOILER*:   When i got outside, i was excited to see what i'd be able to explore and what kind of enemies i would face.   Unfortunately the demo ended there :( But it did leave me wanting to see more :D   Looks like a promising adventure game and i'm looking forward to seeing the future development of it.    Bad Bits    I was having quite a few performance issues at the start and spotty throughout the game. My graphics card was at 30% and it was still laggy with smeared colour when i moved my head. CPU was at 60% (6 Core @ 3.5) and I have a GTX 1070 so i'm pretty sure it's not that.   Unfortunately, the collision detection is pretty horrible. Sometimes you'll hit enemies and items fine, other times you'll be waggling away and getting hit through your shield.   Enemies seem to stand a bit too far away from you which means you have to teleport closer to attack and it just doesn't feel   No help or menu to view controls/settings and because of the spotty collision detection, i was left waggling at the sword/shield to try and pick it up. When i did pick it up, the sword was on my left hand (which didn't feel natural) and i was unable to pick up the shield at all. When i restarted and finally managed to, it was on my right hand which oriented it sideways and basically stopped it from blocking anything without breaking my wrist. In addition to that, no vibration or sword swinging sounds make it a bit detatched from the whole experience. As petty as it sounds, the ability to put your sword away and pull it out is a feature that although small, adds a hell of a lot to the experience. Even the ability to hit your sword against your shield to taunt enemies feels emmersive (Vanishing realms for example)   The damage system shows a 'blink'-esque effect which doesn't discernibly show pain or the location based on where you are facing.   When you finally get to the end, it asks you to press Esc to close the game, and F5 to restart...Errr...It ain't exactly easy to press that with a HMD on and controllers firmly attached at the wrists. (And yes i know you can close it through the steam VR menu, but what if i wanted to just restart the game to try it again? Just a small pain you see)    All in all, try this game. It's free and fun and gives you a sneak peek into what i think is going to be an awesome adventure game. Keep it up devs and i'll be waiting patiently for the next chapter, where i will definitely play and review it again :D.    TL;DR  I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT, GOOD JOB",

            "review_text": "I love seeing more of these RPG games in VR. I was looking forward to something in the style of Vanishing Realms and this is it just it but with a darker theme.  Here are my improvements suggestions: 1) It seems like the sword doesn't track 1:1 with your hand. As I was swinging my sword, it seemed that it lagged after my hand and that was not a natural feeling. 2) It was hard to tell wether I was blocking with my shield or being hit. At one point I thought I was blocking everything and then found out that my health bar is low and I actually got hit a lot. 3) The skeletons sometimes jump on you and they get so close that it feels that they are inside your body. It feels awkward. 4) Even though it is nice that the sword actually collides with the environment and doesn't go through walls, it makes it very difficult to pick up these diamonds. Perhaps if you put your sword away and pick these with your hands it will be easier. Maybe I'm wrong here. 5) Add some kind of story element to make the game more interesting. 6) What I always miss in these games is some kind of leveling system where you get experience and want to engage in more and more battles just to become stronger.",

            "review_text": "Nice game, i like the sword fighting system. Maybe a hard mode for sword fighting would be nice where you have to 'catch' the sword at the position where it was blocked, atm you could just swing through the enemies because the sword will collide its way through them, following your arm movement. Utilize rumble for feedback in hm.In 'The Lab' the devs made the rumble feel like a real bow, that was amazing!  Atm, when your are on a edge of a rock or something you slowly slide it down. This was the first time i got really motion sick until now i thought i am immune to this phenomena, so here is the prove, i am not... I suggest the devs should rework this system, but i have to admit i do not know how to adress this issue either...  I enjoyed the play it was real fun, thx ",
