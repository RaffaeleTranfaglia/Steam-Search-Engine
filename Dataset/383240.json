            "review_text": "Woke up in a kinda dark grey hotel room. When I got bored of touching kinda dark grey things, I left the hotel and emerged on a kinda dark grey street, where I proceeded to the kinda dark grey cafe.  I tried to talk to the kinda dark grey people with glowing white eyes, but they were feeling kinda dark grey and didn't want to talk. Bought a kinda dark grey coffee, and drank it.  Before I could leave, a kinda dark grey police officer with glowing white eyes tried to ask me something about a murder, but a coffee cup flew randomly into his face, and he went to sleep, so I decided to leave.  I wandered around the kinda dark grey streets overshadowed by tall kinda dark grey buildings for several minutes looking for some guy in a place, didn't know where, but I vaguely recalled it was kinda dark grey.  Realizing I had my journal, I decided to refresh my memory, and learned that I could get maps from the police station.  After wandering in search of the police station for several minutes, I ran into a kinda dark grey man with glowing white eyes who told me there was a pizza place to the northeast, but alas, I had forgotten my compass.  Then a kinda dark grey police car stopped in front of me. I was going to ask directions, but then the game ended.  Overall rating: kinda dark grey out of 50",

            "review_text": "Angels That Kill was killing me with it’s ineptitude within five minutes.  The game’s city may have also been killed, because it certainly feels dead. It’s bland, vacant and every area looks the same so navigation is frustrating. The map isn’t very helpful because there’s so few distinctive landmarks. Crows hover over your destination, thankfully, because that’s the only way I could figure out where to go.  The game’s interiors are so dark that what little is there is difficult to see. There’s not much to interact with, and I’m not sure why there’s an inventory at all, as I failed to find a single item I was able to take with me.  Your character’s movement is glacially slow - “running” down the long empty roads is a chore. This is made even more irritating because you need to consume dumpster food to survive. You might spot a dumpster in the distance and traipse down the lane only to find that it's one you’ve already scraped out. It’s also disruptive and unnecessary, I had to leave a crime scene to find a garbage-meal before I collapsed where I stood and was forced through the whole scenario again, and I mean the entire chapter.  Also, it ain’t noire. Noire is more than rain and a monochromatic colour palette, it’s a mood, one that is largely evoked by music, of which this game has almost none. When it does, it isn’t noire.  While the idea of playing as both suspect and pursuer is a good one, and some aspects of its minimalist presentation are appealing initially, very little else here works.",
