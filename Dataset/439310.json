            "review_text": "I've never played Metroid or Castlevania, and I never finished Mario on NES -- so this game's ultra-fast pace and insta-death mechanics so popular in the days of yore should scare me. And they DID! But I love challenges. And big pixels! In fact, though it might not be immediately obvious, it made me think od Hotline Miami -- another game that I didn't feel I stood a chance against and yet tried anyway. Lo-res and intense gameplay aside, you'll find familiar themes of extreme violence and the protagonist's slow descent into madness, including terrifying hallucinations. It's dark, it's gritty, with just the right amount of tech-noir camp and dystopian grotesque. Just like HM, Until I Have You is hard. You'll die. A LOT! By level 4 of Chapter 1 you'll think: hey, I'm getting good at this! -- and for that level 5 will kick you in the shin. Repeatedly. I think I got my 1000 deaths achievement while battling Boss #1. And it'll only get crazier from there. Chapter 4 will have you wonder if it's humanly possible to get through. But you will. You'll learn that the right moment to jump up before an incoming wave of fire is when the flames start bursting right in front of you, and not before (because otherwise they'll burn you when you fall). You'll figure that the right moment to leap over enemies crawling up from below is not when they jump, it's when they're ALMOST in your face as you dash right at them at full speed. I'm currently on level 5.3 -- and needless to say it looks IMPOSSIBLE. Climbers AND divebombers?! :O Not to mention 5.2 gave me enough adrenaline for WEEK! So... enough for now. But I'll get back to it. Tomorrow! The tempo, the rhytm is just too exhilirating to resist. Sometimes it's like I'm seeing in slo-motion (without the actual slo-mo mode on). The rush is just crazy. You'll enjoy it, whether you're a seasoned platformer maniac or a timid sudoku enthusiast like myself!, Because yes, beating your record time in sudoku is ecstasy. But this is better!",
