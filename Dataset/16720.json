Sure, the stealth mechanics are on the simple side, but why is that a bad thing? I'm loving every second of the game - far more enjoyable than some of the more convoluted stealth games out there.  The artistic direction is very nice (with a mix of vibrant and toned down colours. The music is very tense and atmospheric. The a.i, whilst not the best, will make short work of you if you don't make your moves carefully.  The story isn't half bad, either. Dotted with really nice cinematics depicting strange hallucinations and shattered memories - it helps convey a nice, dark, narrative.  Plus, the main character is both attractive and bad ♥♥♥.

            "review_text": "Velvet Assassin is a solid game that has a few quirks to it, but overall doesn't take away from your experience.   As you've seen in the forums for this game, you need to download a specific PhysX driver. You can install it over your existing drivers. I had no problems running this on Windows 8.1.   The main sneaking mechanic is very basic. When your icon glows purple you can't be seen. When it doesn't, you're exposed. I wish there was some sort of fading system to this so I could tell when i'm pushing my limits of being in the shadows. It's an on/off switch.   FYI, you  cannot  replay individual missions. Even after you beat the game. So if you are a collector and missed some items during a level, you better replay it from one of the checkpoints before progressing further.   I had about 3 total crashes that just abruptly sent me back to the desktop. Enough to note but not to complain about.   Pros  +Graphics style is nice. +Autosave system is fairly frequent. +Assassination animations are always satisfying. +Price. I got the game for 49 cents. Unbelievable deal! +Multiple ways of solving each mission.  +No huge difficulty spike. It trends nicely.  +Interesting and diverse enviornments +Smooth constant 60fps   Cons  -Repetitive enemy noises and sayings -Morphine is a get out of jail free card -Forced to use guns toward the end of the game.  -Sneaking system very basic -I never got into the plot. -You need to exploit the stealth mechanics and enemy AI a lot.  -Pet peeve of spawned enemies occurs several times. Relies on some trial and error. -Addition of manual save for PC port would have been nice   Bottom Line  Stealth games are surprisingly relaxing for me to play. Sneak around, watch guard patterns and execute your moves. Velvet Assassin was what I expected. The core mechanics for a stealth game are here, but feel like a lot could have been improved.    6/10  - Good. Slightly above average",

I say if you can pick it up for $5 or less, it is a hell of a deal, if you like Spy/stealth games.   The game has wonderful music, and the atmosphere is heavy, and the graphics aren't bad at all, lighting is great. Gunplay leaves a bit to be desired, but the game does not focus on that aspect. Story is ok, though not its strong suit. AI is dynamic, meaning that sometimes the AI really shines, and other times its as dumb as a rock.  The atmosphere was nice though, creeping around WWII as a stealth assassin, and I am usually WWII'd out.   If they made a sequel I would be happy to get it, on sale of course.  I recommend this game if you can get it on sale, it really was very entertaining, and rather engaging!",

The graphics aren't exactly 'next gen' but they are decent enough. The missions were relatively easy, and the story was well written. No bad voice acting, which actually is a pet peeve of mine. There isn't any re-playability to this, but I played it over again, just because I enjoyed it so much. The only issue I had, was the end battle.

Velvet Assassin is the type of Stealth games that people want, but then when they try it, they think that maybe it isn't what they wanted afterall. The Stealth part of the game, amazingly done and can be very very challenging and force you to go outside of your comfort zone, in order to finish a mission. With that said, it is not a game for those who get flustered over dying or failing over and over. The controls are straight forward and can be a bit clunky at times but are mostly straight forward. The music and sounds are simple but not bad. Graphics, not the best, but its from 2009 so its not that bad, but why bother if you're a graphics nutcase? And the story itself, is fine. not great, but its easy to follow.    So in short, its a truly challenging stealth game that is not forgiving and will give you few alternative options when doing. While the overall reviews for this game say Mixed, I would say, just buy it. It's only $5 so its a very cheap price for a game that will easily net you a solid 6+ hours and more, especially since there is some replayability to it.",

A bit simplistic but effective, you'll get the most of it if you play on the Agent mode, as there is very little room for error, you will die repeatedly but feel invincible when you get the strategy and timing right. Violet is beautifully designed and I'll be glad to follow her on more adventures, as the game's 10-15 hours of gameplay aren't quite enough to squeeze all the WWII possible missions, and it's a shame that there aren't different possible outcomes at the end of each chapter,   specially during the final one, no matter how fast you play there is no way to save the village from it's tragic fire.

            "review_text": "Velvet Assassin is a WWII-based 3rd person game and is basically a simplified version of known stealth games like Splinter Cell.  Due the game taking place in the 1940s, there aren't any nifty gadgets to assist you, so the shadows are your most valuable tool. Ammo for the few weapons you find in the levels is rare, but since the shooting mechanics are horrible that doesn't even matter anyway.  Moving through the levels without being spotted requires a certain amount of tactics and timing, but luckily, by whistling, you can lure enemies into dark places to take them out silently with a variety of brutal takedown animations.  The biggest drawback of the game is the save system. With no manual saves, you have to rely on the rarely placed checkpoints, which - due the nature of the game - can be a very tedious and frustrating task, especially when going for an unarmed full-stealth playthrough.  VA is a game you *can* get, but you certainly won't miss out on anything if you don't.",

I do prefer gameplay that works over gamelay that's complex. The simplicity might make it a bit easier and more straight forward than some bigger steath games. The maps are quite linear. My biggest gripe are some weird checkpoint placements. Sometimes you have to go quite a while without a getting a save. Mostly it's fine, though. I would prefer to save whenever I want to.

The mechanics were a little clunky, but were pretty straight forward and they worked well enough.  It's got some negatives. Checkpoint saves instead of real ones, artificial limits on weapons &amp; ammo to force you to play it stealthily, and an ending that just didn't work for me (a shift from stealth to forced combat at the end, and an unsatisfactory ending to the game), and other pretty minor gripes. But all in all, a fine purchase for the price, several entertaining hours of play, and better value than anything else I've bought for under a buck in a long time! Just don't set your AAA game expectations when you get it - compare it to indy titles or other old games that you paid a comparable price for and you'll be very happy with it.

The game focuses on stealth much more that brute force, not meaning that a fair deal of the situations you might find yourself in can't be solved with the latter method. Having shot, run around, and in any other way killed a bunch of soldiers while they are openly firing at you will cost more than you would ultimately like.  The best feeing I remember having while playing this game, is that it gave me a feeling of grittiness and a constant vigilance. It felt like the character is a spy with limited supplies and not some über-fighter, dual-wielding a rocket laucher and a sniper rifle. The missions were very enjoyable and their themes varied, as were the little introductions before each one. Getting to know your target helped with the immersion before each mission.  Apart from those things though, there were some aspects of the game that did stand out as not so good. At some missions where targets are heavily guarded, a sense of repetition does become aparrent, though this is not too often. My biggest problem was the enemy's visibility, and that most of the time I could use it to my advantage. There were a few cases where my character was obvious, though none of the soldiers seemed to care. Apart from that, a few tweaks with the movement system would have been nice, though I could personally overlook this problem due to my overall fondness of the theme of the game.  I would give Velvet Assassin a solid 6.5/10. Though problems undoubtebly exist, the theme and feeling this game provides is enough to overcome its flaws. A little more work, maybe in form of a patch would make this a far better experience.",

Recently I played the Hitman series and it was obvious where Velvet Assassin got its inspiration; although this game isn't an 'assassin sandbox' as Hitman is, that fits the theme very well. Not every game should have that kind of openess, which to be honest, turned some Hitman levels into a chore. You can indeed kill your targets using many tricks, and if everything else fails, you still can rely on your silenced pistol, just make sure to hide the body afterwards. It has some good hide mechanics too, including the good old pick at a corner and hide into or behind bushes.  Velvet Assassin uses a checkpoint save system, but they are well distributed, and even if you must replay a big chunk of some level, it isn't a frustratingly hard game; it has its chalenge bits, but everything is very well balanced.  The game has a dark tone, which fits perfectly with its WWII settings, it runs very well even with the minimum requirements, and it's extremely solid (I didn't find a single bug within my 2 playthroughs); it has astonishing sound FX too, including weapons sounds, environments, the usual guard-talk and a great soundtrack. I can't recommend this one enough for the stealth game funs.",

It wants to be a stealth action game drenched in gritty realism, but the level of bad game design decisions and massive number of bugs keep me from recommending this game to anybody.  * Don't expect to be able to avoid or sneak past encounters. Several guards and soliders carry critical items you'll need to proceed. Which guards, you may ask? The game won't tell you until they're dead.  *AI alternates between being too dumb to breathe and psychic supersoldiers. Sometimes enemies will spot you even though you're clearly in complete darkness. Sometimes they won't. Sometimes enemy soldiers won't be able to shoot you on full auto from three feet away. Sometimes you'll blink and fall over dead. Sometimes you'll kill an enemy and it will be completely silent. Sometimes it will alert the enemies the next room over.  * The shooting mechanics are bad, supposedly to discourage mindless combat. But then the game forces mindless combat on you, most of the time without warning you.  * The environments look good, but they'll repeat themselves so many times it legitimately feels like you're just playing the same level again and again.  * Checkpoints happen once every 20-30 minutes. In gameplay sections with lots of enemies where most of your time is spent waiting doing nothing, this can get very frustrating very fast.  Whatever this game's strengths, they're far overshadowed by really poor design and technical mishaps that really takes me out of the experience. Can't recommend it.",

Mostly because of stealth: It's much better than more popular 'stealth' games but still not a perfect one. You will fail many times because enemy will notice you when they shouldn't. Parts of game when you need to change into SS uniform are most annoying. And last mission... it changes to shooter game. Level designs aren't also good. Running around because there are parts in this game where locations looks almost same. Fortunately there is a map, so you will need to look at it many times. And a things like 'finding a key for this door which is behind a door WHICH also needs a key' is kinda ridiculous. I don't remember if it was main part of game or maybe for some collectibles but still... Graphics are nice, Violette looks even more nice, german soldiers speaks their native which makes experience while playing even better. BUT if main mechanism of game isn't so good, then it all doesn't matter. If there will be some sale for this game, I guess it's worth at least checking. I wouldn't buy it at full price.",

            "review_text": "Stealth game where stealth is almost completely broken.  Game mostly consists of sneaking behind nazi soldiers and performing stealth kills. However, to perform a stealth kill you must stand still, if you walk, you cannot perform a kill. So it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to perform stealth kills to walking soldiers, because you sneak very slowly and if you catch up to them, you must stop moving, because game doesn't let you to perform a kill while moving. And when you stop, most of the time guards walk too far away from you, so you have to chase them again. So you are chasing after soldiers and spamming LMB hoping you will be able to perform a kill. And when guards stop, they stand for maybe 1 or 2 seconds and they turn around and move again. Whistling is almost useless. If you whistle to attract attention, guards always come to your position. You can whistle and quickly relocate to different position, it doesn't matter, guard will still come to where you are. And if you are whistling when being in a disguise, the guards won't react at all. Yes, if you are dressed up as a nazi soldier, guards won't react to whistling at all, even though they can't see who's whistling. Quite funny. Disguise system is a joke. Firstly, you can only change disguises when being inside wardrobes or toilets. In a disguise you cannot sneak, because all disguises have high heel shoes, which 'make noise' and if you get too close to an enemy he will recognize you just from the sound, even if he is looking the other way. When you are in disguise, white line will appear showing how suspiciuos you are (the longer it is, the less suspicious you are). But it only reacts to the distance you are from the enemies or if you are crouching. Guards could be looking the other way, still they will suspect you if you crouch or if you get too close to them, even though they can't see you. So it is impossible to perform stealth kills with a disguise. It's funny how guard can recognize an imposter just from hearing the footsteps... So when wearing a disguise, you have to keep 50 meter distance from every soldier, even from those who can't see you or else your cover will be blown. Enemy's melee attack does more damage than their bullets. Also enemies move in a weird way when they are being suspicious. They turn by 90 degrees without any animations, and they turn their bodies first, and their heads later. Reminds me of Robocop. And most of the time when a guard is suspicious, he will look and point his gun at you even though he can't see you and don't know where you are. Also, at the end of some levels when you blow something up, game throws at you terrible getaway sections. You are given about 1 minute to get to the end of the level and game throws some guards at you and you have to shoot your way through. At least graphics are nice. Lighting looks good, i also like the brown atmosphere in some levels. Some textures look terrible, but overall graphics are OK. Visuals are no doubt the best thing in this game. Voice acting is also good. Voice actress of main character does a good job. Enemies speak german which is a good thing because it makes you feel like you are really fighting nazis instead of some guys who pretend to be nazis by speaking english with their fake 'german' accent. Also i have to give this game credit - it stays true to stealth genre (most of the time). You cannot just shoot every soldier in the game if you get bored from sneaking because main character cannot take damage and dies very fast and also you don't get many bullets. Usually you start a level with maybe 1 or 2 clips for your handgun and there are just a few weapon and ammo pickups (1~3) in a single level. Which is good for a stealth game, but it's a bad thing for Velvet Assassin, because stealth mechanics in this game are badly executed and because of that sometimes you want to abandon stealth and just shoot everyone. Checkpoints - they are very far away which is a terrible thing. Main character dies very fast (which is a good thing, stealth game after all with female protagonist), but very often you die not because of your own fault, but because of bad game mechanics (i've talked about them earlier). Imagine if the last soldier in the area kills you because you cannot perform a stealth kill while walking 10 cm behind him. And you have to start all over again. And the game is very linear, it doesn't give you any freedom, so when you restart the checkpoint you slowly play exactly the same way you did earlier. This game is frustrating, terribly executed and most of the time you fight game mechanics instead of the enemies. It's a shame, since it had some good ideas. Sure, the game looks good, visuals are great and it creates nice atmosphere, but the gameplay is so frustrating. And no, it's not complete trainwreck like Ride To Hell or Garry's Incident, it's not 1/10 or 2/10 game, it's not filled with bugs, you dont fall through floors, enemies do not teleport or anything like that. But it's just that stealth is so badly executed. And it's a stealth game. However the price is very low right now. For 0.74 - sure, get it. It's almost nothing anyway. But for 4.99 you can get much better games like Sleeping Dogs, Mafia 2 or Hitman Absolution when they get discounted (and they get discounted very often).",
