            "review_text": "This is the makings of a cult classic but there's some things holding it back. Its good fun with a friend and a couple of controllers.  Gunnheim plays a little different than you would expect, basically you have a primary weapon that is generally not good enough to really beat things down with. It'll get you by but you need the special weapon drops. Those special weapon drops tend to have very low ammo so it adds a surprisingly strategic element to the game when you have to decide when is the best time to pull the trigger - because getting it wrong probably means death.  Enemies are distinctly different and you have to deal with them all a little bit differently which adds a lot to the strategy element. Feedback is pretty good too, response from the gameplay is very readable. The 'arcade'-y feel and old school menu art is awesome.  It's super simple yet the skill factor really makes it enjoyable. Most of the significant bugs seems nonexistant but there is plenty of room for polish. Almost every part of the game could use another iteration pass. Animations, hitboxes, AI behavior, level design, etc all need some more attention. A few levels are almost completely pointless because you can just run straight through them with basically no danger. Don't expect Gauntlet style quality level design.  Overall I would say 4/5 for fun and its potential to scale up to something way more awesome pretty quick. Losing points for lack of polish in some areas.",

Quadrupled the resolution with DSR, the game was still running at about the same speed, which suggests it's most likely a CPU/code issue. The game managed to reboot my computer when going back to the main screen, but who knows, maybe it's just my PC that doesn't like this one game.",
