            "review_text": "Unique game. I was a fan of the first one but the second one is so much better.  The best addition here is the 'Battle for Europe' mode which was later basically copied in COH2 Ardennes Assault. So basically just europe divided into regions and you as the commander of a persistent army rushing through.  It's one of the first games that mostly relies on managing an army instead of building it up with resources and such (even though base building is still possible, just not in the battle for europe, which is the best mode).  The fights are always interesting since there are many optional objectives which makes it really fun.  The feeling of this game is great and I like its looks.",

At first, the game did not open at all, then I followed a quick guide and removed two setting files, and got the game working. Then I headed to tutorial to get a grip.   Then what do I see? The game is running. It's running in 10 fps. And I'm not even the type who would hesitate from a bit of lag. But this was plainly unplayable.  I'm sorry, no matter how great this game might be back in the day, I cannot recommend this game under these circumstances.",

And they seem to be able to raise armies a lot quicker...",
