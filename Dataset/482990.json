            "review_text": "TL;DR: boys love visual novel with interesting characters and overly simple game mechanics. Recommended for yaoi fans and fans of other Winter Wolves games.  The story is structured around a simple stat-raising simulation with a weekly schedule and scripted events. The main plot around Marcel's relationship with his father is the same no matter what romance you pursue, and the romance is more of a side plot. Raising skills is necessary to pass skill checks.  Events occur on certain days no matter what you have scheduled (e.g., you don't have to be in the library on Monday of Week 14 to trigger an event with Eloy; you'll just show up there). Skill checks are the same for each playthrough, as well, and so the strategy is very simple:   raise all skills to 10 as soon as possible, then raise them all to 20, raise your chosen love interest's skills to 90, then concentrate in those to increase your reputation and affection.    These design choices make the game friendlier to fans of pure visual novels, but they also make it kind of annoying to play through the game multiple times to see everyone's romance. Failing a skill check just gets you a few different lines, and the bad endings (other than   the non-inheriting friendship end with Licia  ) aren't very interesting, so once you know how to 'win,' there's nothing new mechanically or strategically, and the simulation parts are just dull busywork. There's also no 'successful' romance ending if you don't inherit, which doesn't make sense for characters who aren't tied to the estate.  The art is nice, although it seems like the artist has trouble drawing hands. (Marcel's seem oddly small, and most other characters have their hands behind their back, in gloves, or otherwise hidden.) The sprites have different costumes and a good variety of expressions. For some reason the sprites don't show blushing when it's mentioned in the text, though, which disappointed me, because blushing sprites are the cutest. I'd also have liked more than two CGs per character route, especially since Borges and Vincent's 'sexy' CGs seemed very out of place, more an explicit reward for the player than something that makes sense in the story. Winter Wolves games typically just have a kiss CG at the end, so I didn't really expect more, but I think it would add a lot, especially considering the game's price.  The story is set in Aravorn, a vaguely medieval fantasy world, and mentions characters and events from  Loren the Amazon Princess  and  Tales of Aravorn: Seasons Of The Wolf . However,  Heirs and Graces  isn't an RPG adventure with epic battles, and instead is confined to a noble estate and a small town. Elves exist and the doctor uses magic spells and potions to treat patients, but other fantasy elements don't come into play. I actually like exploring how 'normal' people live in a fantastic world, and look forward to seeing more of the setting in future WW games.  All the romances are BxB, which is a first for WW. Sexual preference isn't a major theme or source of conflict, but one love interest is explicitly bi, one is explicitly gay, and the protagonist might be gay, so the 'straight except for you' yaoi trope is avoided. Marcel, the protagonist, has a developed personality (and a bit of snarky narration) and isn't just a player self-insert. He's inexperienced in relationships, but not shy and passive about it. The romances all have an open sort of 'let's see where this goes from here' ending, rather than a conclusive happily ever after, but I like the realistic awkwardness of that, and it fits with Marcel's character. If you're avoiding the game just because  you  don't want to romance guys, I'd urge you to give it a chance. (There's a  free demo  [winterwolves.com]  at Winter Wolves' website.)  I read fast, and it took me 3 hours to complete my first playthrough, 8 hours total to see all events and endings (skipping previously read text and not using a walkthrough).",

            "review_text": "From a break from other games, i purchased and played this Visual Novel. First thing i noticed was no Fullscreen (Windowed). As i played the game, i didnt really understand the rep building mechianic and had alot of trial and error moments and in my first attempt got the bad ending, turns out if you don't have the 10/10 rep on week ?? you don't get to advance on the story and recieve the bad ending. I did enjoy the Scheduler but would have perfered to have been able to put in 2 jobs a day into it, the one feels rather restrictive.  I did very much enoy all the chats with the character Eloy and whoever wrote around that character did fab job. Another thing i chuckled at was that everyone is fed bread. Make soup, serve bread. I feel like that it could have had soome CGI screenshots in it but it might later on, as i stated i got instant bad ending.  Not a bad visual novel game. I will attempt this again in the near future. 7/10",

About the status raising, it was a little difficult in the beginning, but at some point I got the hang of it.  ",
