            "review_text": "Sometimes in life we need to be introspective, and ask ourselves difficult questions...questions which require us to look deep within and examine the very essence of our core and being.     With that weighty premise in mind, ask yourself THIS question: Have I ever wanted to abduct sheep (and cows and chickens) by using a small UFO to bully them into a bigger UFO? If you answered yes, then: A. You are probably a very bad person (or an alien); and B. You just might enjoy Flock! I know I'M enjoying it, even if the experience is a tad frustrating at times (think '♥♥♥♥ me, soooo close...do I really have to play this level AGAIN?')...but on the whole, a very 'cute' and cleverly-constructed puzzle game, and one that's not toooo hard (at least not so far...I'm up to level 15 or so).    Oh, and just in case you require further existential impetus: MOST HILARIOUS SHEEP SOUND EFFECTS IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY. And the music is pretty ♥♥♥♥in' groovy, too. About the only thing it's severely lacking in is MONKEYS, but hey, you can't have everything (its longevity and replayability may also be up to some question, but for this price, you'd have to be an ♥♥♥ to complain)...   Verdict: 9/10.",
