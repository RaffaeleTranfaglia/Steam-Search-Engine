            "review_text": "This was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain/pirate. There are ships. The ships come in different sizes and configurations. You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships. Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off is the only one that makes it. There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses. There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy. The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy. It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.  Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options. There are less than other space games I've tried. Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is. You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything. Aiming is done via turrets. Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space. That's what you're here for right?  It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged. Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy. I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut. I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons. I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds. I enjoy exploring. I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought. I enjoyed this game. And the free DLC.  Spaaaaaaaaace. What's your favorite thing about space? (mine's space)",

The devs are super responsive and really care about the community. Keep in mind this is a tactical combat sim with trading aspects. There is a living economy, but personally I never paid any attention to it.  Destroy enemy ships, capture enemy ships, loot enemy ships, grapple enemy ships, hack enemy ships. Do whatever it takes to defeat the enemy. Expansive map with plenty of variety to keep you exploring. Ships, officers, mercenaries, trading opportunities, weapons, weapon enhancements, system enhancements, equipment, etc.   This game is an awesome space game in terms of what its selling point is: a tactical combat RPG space sim.",

            "review_text": "Loved this game. Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine.  Just like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as ♥♥♥♥ was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...). No game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!)   In short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!",

            "review_text": "A good game that could have been a great game.  After several hour of play the missions quickly get repetitive. Trading and mining get boring even quicker. The real challenge of the game is capturing enemy ships (and it is the only way to make enough money to advance in the game).  The faction system didn't much much sense to me, and didn't seem very important as it was just goodies vs badies in the end.  Near the end game there was nothing to spend your cash on. The weapons at the end of the game really aren't much better than what you get 20% into the game.  The game crashes from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game thanks to the auto-save feature. It is a 32bit only game and seems to run out of virtual RAM. The developers should have also included a 64bit executable in the install package.  So, good fun for maybe 20 hours.  Some suggestions as to what would have made this a great game. - Some ship customisation (and why can't I see the weapon arcs) - More variety in the enemy ships (maybe some boss ships) - Some random system wide events. Not just random pirates - The hacking (and anti-hacking) features making some sense. I didn't get hacked ever, but had zero protection. - More high end weapons and gear - The galaxy having low and high level sections rather than being seemingly mostly uniform. At the moment sectors are either friendly or impossibly hard. I never found any netural sectors.",

While you're waiting for things like Elite and Star Citizen to come down in price (or release), this is an excellent stop gap game.

You can easily get 20 buck worth of enjoyment out of it, plus some. When the game is done, you will be glad you did get in on early access. Fun ships and plenty to choose from, even now. Good fight and flight modes of flying. Great space eye-candy. No loading screens to get from one side of the map, to the other. Unless you are using the jump gates, then there is a small load. You want that ship the npc is flying? Just board it TAKE IT!!..lol Over all, I cant give much of any complaint. As a reference, its like a graphics smak down, with a upper cut in gameplay, to Freelancer!!..lol (only SP, no co-op multi..-1/2 star..lol) I give it 4&amp;1/2 stars out of five: with it, as it stands, in Alpha  EDIT: Now that this little gem is fully released, I can go ahead and say I wasn't wrong in my EA review. There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!",

            "review_text": "Starpoint Gemini 2 recently left Early Access, and it is now one of the few games of that honour to actually turn out well. If I was to compare it to anything, I'd say it's like Freelancer or an offline EVE, though not quite as complex as the latter. Complete sandbox freedom. Go wherever you want and be whatever you want, whether that be a trader, pirate, mercenary, miner, fighter, explorer etc.   Though it is a space sim, it also plays a lot like an open world RPG. You pick from three different classes - COMMANDER: has a focus on buffing friendly units, GUNNER: all about maximising firepower and ENGINEER: boosting your own power systems and hacking/debuffing the enemy - and go around doing freelance missions, mining, fighting or exploring, and it all gives you XP (and sometimes money) to level up your character. Levelling gives you the ability to spend points on improving your class skills, which can be used in battle, and attaining perks, which provide buffs to a number of things like increasing troop strength for boarding ships or improving trade prices.  Besides the sandbox 'Freeroam' mode where you are able to freely explore, there is also a recently added Campaign mode. This provides you with story missions, but you lose the ability to pick your class, character portrait or choose from one of the three starter ships (it forces you into a Taurus ship, arguably the best of the three anyway). The story isn't great, and it's a little buggy, but you can still freely explore and do whatever you want while doing it. The story missions are not particularly interesting (go from point A to B, kill target, deliver package, meet NPC etc), but they give you something else to do. If you're feeling aimless and not sure what to do next, the campaign missions can be a good way to provide yourself with a sort of goal or objective. Each mission will advance in level and difficulty, and you will often find yourself needing to gain XP and a more powerful ship in order to advance. I found that It added to the feeling of progression, albeit in a not very interesting way. It's completely optional, but I personally had no interest in it.  There are nearly a hundred ships to acquire by either buying them or grappling and boarding an enemy ship, killing the crew and towing it back to a nearby station to either sell ( for a very high price ;] ) or place in your garage for use, and they are all customisable. You can equip them with a variety of different weapons like railguns, plasma cannons, beam weapons and heavy weapons. You can enhance your systems by purchasing upgrades for things like your propulsion engines or shield generators. You can even give them a new paint job and add decals, though the colours don't stand out too well and the decals are just a short list of basic emblems. You do have the ability to add your own custom ones, but I didn't mess around with that feature. They're nice cosmetic touches, but nothing to rave about. The boarding is also fully automated and you don't actually get to see anything happening. It's nothing more than watching troop numbers rise and fall and choosing whether or not to send reinforcements. Quite unexciting to say the least, but stealing ships this way will be your main source of income, and managing to capture an expensive ship still gave me a lovely feeling of satisfaction despite the lack of a more involved system.  Your ship is freely controlled, you can fly it yourself wherever you wish with the WASD keys and your mouse. You also must manage your power output. Do you divert all power to engines to give yourself a speed boost, to shields to make them hold out longer, to weapons so they fire for longer or do you try to balance between them all? It's very situational and you will find yourself having to tweak it back and forth very often when travelling and in combat. It's a system I quite enjoy as it keeps you occupied and helps with keeping the combat and travel feeling busy.  Speaking of combat, it's very fun, though not too complex. You can aim and fire your weapons yourself or have it done for you with autofire (though it can be inaccurate at times) and positioning is key. You and your enemy have four directional shields, one for each side, and each decreases under fire accordingly, meaning you should focus fire on one side if you wish to do optimal damage. If any of you have played Star Trek Online, the shielding is pretty similar to what that game has. You also have a choice of four skills, which differ depending on your choice of class. Each provides some sort of combat buff and can be levelled to add more effects. On top of that, there are then a multitude of items you can purchase and use whenever you wish, such as temporary speed boosters, repair drones or T-Drives (these allow you to instantaneously jump great distances) and a variety of other things. If used right, they can really save you when in a tight spot.  One issue with the combat however, is balance. I often found myself easily destroying ships marked as 'impossible' targets to beat due to having bought a reasonably expensive weapon or by managing to acquire a powerful ship. This can really mess with the early game and make it far too easy. It does begin to even out the further you level due to enemy scaling, but as long as you continue upgrading, it never gets difficult enough. This is tricky to do however and really only becomes a problem once you're comfortable and good at the game, which takes time.  Overall, and despite some flaws, I believe this to be a good game with a lot of love and care put into it by the devs. It is just oozing with content and interesting, well polished mechanics. If the developer's words are anything to go by, a huge list of future content is still planned for Starpoint Gemini 2 and all of it will, supposedly, be completely free of charge. Hopefully a game to keep your eye on.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of space sims, sandbox titles and even people who are awaiting Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen. It's not overly complex and it does lean a little more on the arcadey side of things, but despite that, it's still a deep enough experience to sink some enjoyable hours into.  Score: 7/10",

You can be a star trader, pirate, a security operative, or... yes, even a mere space station mechanic -- only accepting missions to repair other space stations to earn your money. The combat is intelligent and engaging, but not too challenging. The only drawback is I cannot bring my friends in.

            "review_text": "It took nearly 20 hours to finally come to a conclusion on this game.  Despite all efforts made to make the combat complex - energy management, 4 different active abilities (with a kinda silly feeling levelups with them), and up to 4 consumable items (of a selection of around a dozen) useful for combat - it just isn't all that fun. I believe the biggest culprit is turrets. While it is possible to partially blindside a less maneuverable ship than yours in 1v1, ultimately maneuvering and dodging in combat is best done by spinning around in circles. When you're spinning around in circles, you can't effectively target and attack targets manually, and so you rely on fire-at-will auto targetting to do that job for you. This is boring.  The economy is workable, but not that interesting - different stations have a set low-mid-high value for all of the commodities. Buy and sell appropriately.  The storyline is workable. The Gemini universe is interesting, and is worth reading about if you're into that sort of thing. The storyline does an almost adequate job of immersing you in that universe. The voice acting/writing is awwwwwwful.  The good: All around, this is a workable game that will scratch your spacefaring itch, though will likely not leave you satisfied. The graphics are beautiful, each region of space is very well stylized in the coloring, asteroids, and various anomalies. Plenty of the starbases and ships have pretty unique detailed models. Music and sound are good, although the short soundtrack for the music is a mild disappointment there.",

You cant actually give them commands so a lot of times they will conflict with what you are trying to do (like board a ship and they will fire destroying it).  The story is also mediocre and the VO is down right bad.   There are too few side missions at least in the story mode (basically go destroy or capture target, repair or scan anomaly and move cargo/vip from station to station).

Hire officers and also mercenaries. 4)You have missions available at different places where you can accept or reject to earn money and experiences. 5) Mods availble for this game. 6) You have traits and specials skills as you level.  Cons  1) Tutorials wordings are too small!!! 2) I find it not very user friendly even though the tutorials are there for you. It seems that I struggle for quite some time to get used to it and also the mission chart map seems nto well constructed. To me its not user friendly. 3)Something is missing in this game I am not too sure.  I will still recommend this game because of the things you can do in the game. Its the freedom to roam.

So if that's true then this game is a good place to start, because I had fun playing the free roam sandbox mode.  Lots of stuff to explore. Good controls. Nice visuals. Cool soundtrack.  The negative: Earning money is slow until you're strong enough to take on heroes. You'll have a hard time earing enough to buy a new and better ship (which is important). However, once you start killing those heroes for rewards, you will quickly earn more than you need (which in turn feels a little imbalanced).  Sandbox mode was a little repetitive. Short framrate drops when the game loads a new area in front of you (which in turn have lead to a crash here and there).  If I was to play again, I'd start the story mode instead of the free roam.

I did not get the impression of a complex game, but merely a simplistic space simulator, with very little depth. Worth it for a bargain, and only if you are interested in space sim games that are not too complex or fascinating. Factions only differ in name and equipment, and the presentation is shallow overall.

Freedom: Full freedom to do whatever you want, wherever you want, whenever you want is why this game is great. You can become a full time miner and collect minerals, you can ferry goods from station to station and trade for money, you can capture enemy ships and DRAG them back to your base to sell.   Combat: Perhaps the best part of this game is the combat system. It is really like a 3d dogfight in space ships. Do not expect a true space physics, but the combat system is one of the most fun I have played. You actually fly the ship yourself and shoot the weps yourself. Direct full energy to shields to survive, weps to destroy, or engines to run like hell!  RPG: You gain levels as you go. You can kill ships for small XP or do missions for more XP. You can level up each of your 4 special skills, get bonuses to your 'profession', and buy new ships at higher levels, each with their own special traits.  Glitches: I have had about 10 full crashes in 24 hours of playtime. I have many out of memory errors when I still have lots in task manager, although the game still runs, for a while... In game glitches are more frequent but less noteworthy.",

The only thing bugging me about the game is the frequent pauses and stutters whilst flying through zones - the game will literally stop for a second, at first it didn't bother me but since starting the story mode the pausing seems to stand out more and has become a pet hate. Going to wait for a few updates and hopefully this will get cured, not sure I can finish the game whilst this is an issue.  I'm going to recommend the game because it is a really fun game, if these pauses get cured it will be really enjoyable, and I do think it will be cured because the devs have been doing a great job.  (And before anyone blames my spec for the pauses - I'm using a i7 4770K, 16GB ram, GTX 770 and the game is running from a 3TB WD black.)",

For the complaint, and it may be something on my end, I'm experiencing a lot of crashes, still worth it to reload every hour or so though. As for a suggestion, I love the open world sandbox feel, however a more effective fast travel would be nice. My second suggestion would be to work in some speaking graphics of an alien or human pirates or whoever is talking when I recieve a message from somebody in the upper left cornet within the exploration game. I just feel like it would be more engaging with that.",

Even with a few issues (voiceover audio not playing, no docking animations, navigation issues when you hit go-to when you're next to a station you've docked at, etc.) this game is very, very fun. Unlike the space sims before it (Freelancer) and the modern ones coming out (Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen) which focus on the mechanics of a more agile fighter, Starpoint Gemini 2 focuses much more on a capitol ship feel. You're not a lone pilot darting through space in a dogfight, you're sitting at the helm of a Carrier, deploying fighters, and watching your crew unload your ship's payload. Power management is stressed, as is the use of powers and items that bolster shields, shut down enemy systems, etc.   One thing I love about this game which I have not yet seen in another space sim is the ability to send your troops over to capture another ship. This happens to be one of the best ways to make money, and is extremely fun. Unfortunately it doesn't give you any experience (which seems a little peculiar, considering it's an integral part of many people's strategies), but the payout is fantastic.  All in all, worth buying, though I haven't played it since Elite: Dangerous came out lol",

            "review_text": "I remember getting this game when it was still in its alpha/beta form with only a few things to do besides blowing up ships, blowing up asteroids, taking their goods, and then selling them at a market for a few dollars (which seemed weird back then because ships cost a ♥♥♥♥ TON and still do, but there are ways to get more money now.) So playing now, seeing that it is full release form, welllllll....it's still empty. I mean, there is absolutely almost nothing going on except for an occasional enemy ship flying in to a friendly territory that gets obliterated in a second. Other than that, nope, nothing. People that hate you, hate you and people that like you, like you, not much else. I thought it'd be awesome to be the revered space pirate captain who steals from all and gets in the way of people to scavenge as much money as possible, even between factions. Which is another huge problem, factions do not feel like they have bad ties between each other, it's as if they are both completely isolated with their borders set in place without anything in between. And there aren't even any huge battles as well, the closest one I got was between myself and 30 other enemy ships. So you might ask, 'What is there to do?' Well, exactly what I explained at the beginning, you do missions, kill enemies, blow up debris and turn it into a station for some money, like, a little amount of money. And the most money you get is from ship debris -floating ship debris and destroyed ships- which on maximum with the stock ship which can only hold 45 units is about $30,000 maximum give or take. So how much does an upgraded ship minus weapons cost? Depending on your preference from the different types, a direct upgrade would be from 2-5 mil even though it can go higher to prices of 30 million. So with mining and missions ranging in price from 10-20 thousand, you're looking at doing this 66 times to afford a new ship and that's at the maximum you'll get from mining and missions just for a 2 mil ship. Yes, there are hero ships that give you about 5 mil if you destroy them, but so far I've found no real way to track them other than hearing the news saying they are in so-and-so region, and even if you do find them, they are at impossible difficulty and usually have other ships around them so good luck. Did I have fun though? Yes, I had fun in some parts when I tried to dodge enemy ships while firing, but after your first few things to do it gets incredibly boring.",

Not only can you see what various commodities are trading for at the stations you have visited, you also see the distance you currently are from each of those stations. This adds another level of decision making – is the extra distance you might have to travel for a ‘best’ price worth the time it will take to get there, or is a slightly lower price actually the better deal? A small thing, perhaps, but it does make you approach your cargo manifest a bit more critically when deciding on what and when to trade.  The second thing this encourages is exploration. You only see the prices for the stations and planets you have discovered. I find myself compelled to push into unknown territory on that never ending quest for the ultimate trade route. And the commodity information screen itself is wonderfully easy to use. The filters are a tremendous help, eliminating the need to scroll through every item available. Are you a miner? Click on ores. Love to hunt down pirates? Quickly discover who is offering the best price for those contraband items.  As you may have guessed, I’m a merchant at heart, not a fighter. But I’ve found the battles to be well-balanced and a simple click will tell you if that tantalizing enemy ship you have your eye on has the capability to turn you into so much space dust. Not that the knowledge will necessarily stop you, but at least you’ll know what you’re up against. And for those times when you do take on just a bit more than you can chew and yet somehow manage to pull it off by the skin of your shields, well – you know the feeling.  The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is addicting, and personalizing your ship is as much fun as creating a new character in most RPGs. At this point the only thing I’m hoping for is that we may eventually see a larger collection of avatar portraits. The new group was a nice addition, but as a female gamer I find the two current offerings lack some of the personality that the male portraits possess. And that something so minor is the only flaw I can find says a lot about how truly innovative and honestly fun this game is.   Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a trade empire to build. ",

I think these games all struggle with the combat elements - this ons is still probably better than most. another frustrating is the ships automatic pilot to waypoints seems a bit weird, it heads in the wrong direction sometimes. thats not a biggie really.  All in all, at this early stage I would give this an 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of game - a mix of exploring, upgrading, with some combat thrown in - a quieter game to have a session on when needing a break from the fps shooters etc...   its good!",

Campaign is nothing super special, but there are so many side missions or freelance things, I don't see it as a big deal.

This game allows you to change alignments based on your actions. For the first 10 hours I was just trying to get to the point where I can strike out on my own as a pirate but ended up feeling that I wouldn't want to betray the people I had been helping the whole time. I'm not RPing as a bounty hunter, hunting down all criminals with a bounty on their head. It's pretty great.  The art direction is absolutely amazing. So much so that I got a SG2 background for my desktop. I feel like it really grasps the true beauty of space. The music is deep and emersive and it changes based on the situation in a smooth manner.   Cons: The learning curve was pretty tough in the beginning. There was a tutorial but it was kind of a huge wall of text after another.  Conclusion: This is a truly amazing game. I wish these devs had an EA budget so they could make even more content.

It's viable to be a miner and buy ships and outfit them just for that. I personally spent several fun hours just doing that, it was great. You can buy and upgrade ships just for smuggle or escort or freelancing. People complain about the expense of ships versus reward of missions; these people simply don't get it. There are lots of ways to build your bank roll and the time and effort it takes make the game more rewarding and immersive. The balance makes it so much better as you progress, you can't just jump from the first ship to the most powerful ship or even the most powerful weapons right away, and that is good. You actually get to enjoy and explore each level of progress , as you get a new ship, or a new upgrade and you slowly work toward that next purchase. All the while playing however you want, avoiding combat in favor of mining and trade which is super fun, figuring out how to avoid destruction or detection while making the kesel run in under 3 parsecs. Or you can be a pirate, good or bad, hijacking ships with a ship optimized just for that sort of activity. So good. So highly recommended.",

I still recommend it though for those in urgent need of a space sim who don’t like Elite: Dangerous and can’t wait for Star Citizen since chances are good that you still will get lost in the vicious circle of just one more mission to be one step closer to the next upgrade/weapon/ship.  Let’s start with the good things: I really like the music… ok… that’s not all, there is so much to see and do in this game, too. The galaxy is huge and there are many (unique) space stations and planets to visit, missions to do, artifacts/blueprints to track down and especially ships to destroy, buy or capture. Yes, you can capture enemy ships – in theory – that is one part where the design just doesn’t work out so well, more on that later. You also gain experience and level up which will give you skill points and every 5 level a point for perks. Skills feel rather cheap and bad for me. There are 4 active skills (temporary boosts) you can invest your points in, each skill for one of the available weapon systems (railgun, plasma, beam and heavy (missiles)). So you basically decide which is your favorite weapon system and put your skill points into that skill. Perks are passive but also don’t feel that well thought out. Again you can increase the effectiveness of your favorite weapon system up to 3 times and then there are a lot of semi useful perks to invest in. Additionally you get permanent bonuses by getting (steam) achievements (never seen that before in a game...)  The actual space simulation needs to get used to, too. I was expecting a feeling like in the old games and even bought a joystick to get the good old times back, but that just doesn’t work out (for me). The shooting is turret based (you have chase cam and no cockpit view anyway), meaning you can see around your ship and you just move the camera freely and aim with your mouse (depending on the turret placement on the ship). Furthermore the hit feedback is so bad that I quickly decided to switch to beam weapons that are instant hit so I know where I aim is what I hit. Railgun and plasma are projectiles flying somewhere in the direction of the enemy and unless you are not fighting a huge freighter close combat you barely see if you hit or not and especially if not why not (ok, it might just need to get used to but beam seems the better solution). Also you can just tell the system to auto fire (that's why there are acurracy stats you can influence, but I want to play the game as space shooter and not strategy game like star wolves so I don't want to use autoaim...)  What is really bad and I don’t understand how the design can fail so hard is that you can’t see your enemy information in the hud. Instead the hud is clustered with stupid, bad looking buttons I barely use (which I could easily access by keys). You only see the enemy information when the enemy is in sight and when he is close it is so fast moving that you can barely read it. So what is happening all the time is: There is a bunch of enemies closing in, you see them in the radar, you can target them (via hotkey) but you have either to start flying into their direction (which is a great idea when it turns out that they are deadly) or switch to turret and target mode and move your camera wildly to get them into focus and be able to identify their threat level. Both very inconvenient since you should be able to quickly cycle through all targets and identify them with one glance. Well perhaps I’m missing something, there even is an info hotkey but it won’t work for enemy ships, only for special objects.  The other really bad design issue is the character level system. You level up quite fast and the missions you can get (you don’t have to visit stations to get missions, you will get them while in space, which is good) show the suggested level you should have to take that mission. The problem is: the character level does tell ♥♥♥♥ about your actual strength. That only depends on your ship and weaponry. So this indicator is useless in the first place. Coincidentally it is also useless in the second place because there are types of missions that are just no brainers – regardless of which level they show. If you have maintenance or science missions you just fly to the target, repair or inspect it aaand… it’s done. On the other hand, good luck with rescue or capture missions, which are often impossible even on low level. So the balancing is very bad in general but luckily you can cheat your way out most of the time: Early game you just start your engine boosters and outrun every enemy, mid game they sometimes start blocking your boost mode but you can have a ship with cloaking device by then and just turn that on. Later this doesn't work and thats when you get in real trouble… Talking about capturing… first you can’t capture 90% of the enemies because they have a larger crew than you have (capturing works this way: grapple the enemy with a tractor beam, send troops via teleporter to his ship, if you have more than him you possibly take over the ship). You can focus on capturing by searching for a cheap ship which allows a large army of troopers on board and you can get perks or officers (you can hire 3 officers for your ship, by the way, you can also hire merc ships that follow you and certain ships allow to take fighters on board you can launch during combat so you end up having your own fleet) that give a bonus on the capturing chances. Second most of the time there are other ships around. So even when you manage to find a capturable ship chances are high that it will get blown apart by some other ship nearby. So it is a great feature in theory that just is no real fun most of the time but satisfying when it finally works.  Other weaknesses I like to mention: The presentation is really bad. The main story has a ridiculous voice over most of the time, sometimes just dialog (not sure if it is a bug that voiceover is not playing because the music gets muted anyway) and sometimes just a text popup – atmosphere = 0. The balancing of the main and some side missions is also a bad joke. You will be stuck for hours until you have enough money for a capable ship and after you finally progress you often get much easier missions afterwards.  The menus are confusing and tedious to use. E.g. you can either sell all cargo or one good at the merchant, but if you have more than 1 of a good you always have to go to the next screen to select how much of the good you want to sell (well everything!). And you will do that a lot because the screen shows if you are having good, mediocre or bad prices so you most likely don’t want to sell the goods with bad prices and rather fly to the next station. I think the ship loadout menu is simply bugged. edit: it is not bugged, turret handling is just another unintuive feature. Also when I unmount a rocket launcher I lose my missiles. The good thing is that I can store my ships with their loadout in my garage and can swap them easily depending on the situation (cargo space/troop count/gun power). But the weapon/ship prices balancing could be much better. The next better systems are so expensive that it takes hours until you can afford something new that actually feels more powerful. The upgrade flow was much better/faster in Freelancer. Last but not least there are that most annoying situations where a cutscene triggers in the middle of a fight, you can’t do anything but the fight continues in the background usually resulting in your death or at least a great headstart for your enemies. So there are many occasions in the game where I ask myself: Did the developers actually play what they created? And then I go back to the game desperately hunting for the next better ship…",

            "review_text": "I purchased this game almost immediately during early access because I had been wanting to play a good space sim for quite a long time. It is a vast improvement over the previous title in the series and successfully creates a fun space sim experience with some rpg progression for your character.   Initially after release the game was somewhat buggy, but the developers have ironed out the rough edges and even successfully adapted most of the user interface for gamepad control. Thus far I have spent most of my time in the sandbox mode, but I have recently begun the story playthrough. Both modes are fun to play with the story mode featuring a rather standard, but competently-executed space sim plot. Best of all is that steam workshop is available for the game and there have been many great mods that improve aspects of the gameplay as well as those that create custom content.   There is a good diversity of ships and weaponry in the game, with ship types ranging from small gunships and shuttle craft up to battleship size vessels available to be purchased. You can also hire officers who confer stat bonuses and other ships piloted by mercenaries to join you. There are numerous ways to make money including a robust trading economy, asteroids to mine, spatial phenomena to explore, odd jobs to be done, transport/taxi missions, and of course bounty hunter missions.  Combat is satisfying, though you certainly feel like more of a ship commander than a pilot. This is probably due to the game's third person perspective which suits the game well because most of the ships you will use are more like capital ships than fighters.   To sum it up, this is one of the best single player space sim/rpg's to come out in a very long time. In some ways I enjoy this game more than Elite: Dangerous.",

So even if I am not an expert, I think I can write a fair review.  + Great Value. You easily can beat the game 2 / 3 times without feeling bored. And the Dev team enhanced the First Starpoint to the new engine, it should give you around 50 hours more of gameplay. + Cool graphic; not realistic like Elite Dangerous for example, but a very nice representation of space. + Nice gameplay / Mix of Rpg and tactic space game ; if you play in high difficulty it can be very challenging. + A lot of things to do. + A lot of ships and weapons to suit all tastes. + A extremely nice and responsive Dev Team. Basically if you post anything ( interesting ) on the steam forum, there is good chances that a Dev will be the first to answer. + A perfect example of how a Early Access should be done and handled. + Mod support.  - Scenario not great. - A little bit short. I know it is against my + on greate value, but the thing is I think 35 hours to reach max level is a little bit to quick; of course if you want the best weapons you will have to spend a lot of times, but it lacks the motivation of leveling up. - At the end you are incredibly overpowered.

Also supports mods which i already install one, and audio mod for the engines. even so the game is looking to be one that i will play for months if not years. the ship sized feel a bit off as they are not that different from smaller ships. maybe the dev will consider resizing some of the ships. some of the weapons sound could use some work as the laser as they are dont sound very flashy. i hope more options open up interms of upgrades you can do too the ships such as larger shield if the ship can handle it. Also ships you capture can be added to your fleet at a cost but not to the level of mercs after all they are your factions (player influence ) i do hope they add medium shields, turrets, the heavy weapons as they are now require rearming. would be nice to have some that are laser base that shot out a massive beam but take a long time to reg at no cost to rearming. that would be a good trade off. shield don't always work as they should i often taken hits from the left only to take damage from the right shield ? as if the shots went right through my ship. none the less considering your getting a massive open sandbox world and lots of things you can do will keep you coming back. I'm sure the dev will balance the classes as will as the damage in time. i really hope they continue to expand the RPG side of this game a bit more and add some more side mission (freelancer). Also be able to take bases for a faction. joining a fleet in order to win over a terrorties would be cool. so far i would give this game a 7 out of 10 and when its complete i'll review it again",

It does not have the vast options and customization as games like EVE or X, but I would trade that for a more fun and easy to play game.  Like: -Open world with a variety of play styles. -Good selection of ships and equipment loadouts. -Looks great, cool ship and station designs. fairly immersive -Easy to learn controls and interfaces, even decent camera control. -Combat is fun and sometimes intense.  Really enjoyed: -Capturing ships. -Trading (Easy to use 'best buy/sell' interface!) -Exploring, pirate hunting -Completing full loadouts on a ship feels very accomplishing.  Dislike: -Map feels small and underwhelming. -Copy pasted missions (gets old in any game though.) -Story started out pretty lame (avenge my father! collect stuf!) but i didnt get far into it. voice acting was passable.. -Random impossible difficulty battleships showing up out of nowhere, or even in a mission.  -I feel like some stats are missing, or hard to manage when making a loadout. Such as: Weapon energy consumption vs regen. And how to buff regen / lower consumption? Turret arc max angles. Fix: List this on ship stats, or a visual on the loadout page would be awesome. A better display of your ships stats (the circular display looks very awesome, but is not practical when zoomed out.) Is there a display for your own crew size?

But that's not exactly a terrible thing. i guess i'll just list the negative points first:  1 - tracking speed is too slow, especially in turret view (and yes i have turned my sensitivity higher, no help) 2 - enemies spawn too close to friendly bases sometimes, and prevent you from docking (especially annoying when trying to complete a taxi mission or bring in a captured ship) 3 - friendlies don't care that you are trying to cap that expensive ship, and is REALLY annoying when they destroy it within SECONDS of capturing it! 4 - trying to capture a ship too close to certain anomoly's (spelling is crap, but im drinking, so understand) and wormholes can lead to MASSIVE frustration, as your grappling beam will disconnect, but granted, is generally not a problem. 5 - auto pilot can be worse then having a drunk, blind, parapalegic man (or women) with 1 arm and 2 fingers try to drive a car with half a steering wheel through a mine field...

Gameplay: The gameplay is really great, traveling around the univers in your little space ship is always a persons dream. and the dream can be true in this game. The game focuses much on trading to get money, to keep your staff, and repair your ship. So you can not just go out and shoot other space ships. 9/10  Story: You really have to focus on the story, otherwise you will forget what have happened. the story takes time to get through, and it makes the playtime last longer. Of cause, if you do not get bored of the game. The story is really great and interresting. 8/10  Graphic: The graphic is actually quiet good, it shows the effects clearly and the models is well made. The models is great and looks cool, so you can have the space ship you want. 8/10  Sound: The sounds is not the great, it can be hard to hear the voices, and I have seen that it suddently skipped a dialoge in the main quests. They could have used a bit more time, making the sounds fit better to the game. 6/10",

I needed a bigger ship, which I did a few times over, from your first gunship, to a corvette into a frigate. Fights were hard, sometimes impossible, so my quest for more power continued. At 30 hours I got my first Battleship class spaceship. The immense power I unleashed on the Starpoint Galaxy was crazy, I kept capturing ships, making more money and destroyed my foes.  I guess I keep laughing till I have wiped all enemy generals from my star chart.",

There are some very interesting and rewarding side quests. The sandbox random encounters and freelance missions are still there and very good. There are very few bugs, and the performance is outstanding.  This game is much less ambitious than, say, Star Citizen, in scope. It is a fairly limited third-person arcade-ish space shooter and trading game. However, everything that it does, it does WELL. That's a very respectable trait of a game, in this day and age, where the tendency is to over-promise and under-deliver. Starpoint Gemini 2 is intended to be an enjoyable single-player space opera where you acquire resources, build a fleet, gain renown and reputation, help some factions and war against others, and complete a storyline -- kind of like Skyrim in space. In attempting to implement these goals, it succeeds at them extremely well.   I can highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good space adventure, with graphics that are slightly above average for 2015 (though not cutting-edge), tight game mechanics, and an interesting main plot.",

Theres no system in place to actually figure out the best place to sell your goods so trade routes are a chore and not really worth it.  The graphics are really nice but poorly optimized and some of the graphics options are locked at 'high' like ship details and cant be lowered.  The balancing is also all over the place with alot of weaponsystems being rather useless (all beam weapons for example) compared to the railgun type wich obliterates everything. Also even thought you can hire mercenaries to fly with you for a ingame monthly fee it never feels like you are actually in command of a fleet... wich is another missed oportunity.  All in all what this game lacks is content... alot of content and a healthy dose of polish. There is a really great game hiding in starpoint gemini 2 but it just doesnt has any meat on its bones.  So at its current state i can only recommend this game to hardcore space sim lovers who are starved for a title where you controll a battleship instead of a flimsy little one man fightercraft.

I got my first achievement purely by accident just by following the first waypoint . . . which turned out to be in the core of the planet I was trying to land on rather than, as I'd assumed, at some kind of space elevator docking station. When I finally figured out how to land, visually it was much the same as crashing into it - I still flew to about the same range but instead of warning me to stop and then exploding, the ship stopped and I got the planet menu.  While the game claims to support joystick control it's very much designed for mouse and keyboard, with the mouse leaving the targeting reticle wherever you last clicked something. I ended up awkwardly using the joystick in my left hand and trying to target with the mouse before giving up in disgust and returning the controls to their default joystickless configuration.  The starting spaceship flies like it's on rails regardless of the control method you choose and looking through the keybindings gives me no hope of more maneuverable craft later on - you can move forward, turn and roll. No backward or lateral movement. Your best bet in a firefight seems to be to leave the turrets on autofire and do your best to fly out of the way of your target's firing lanes. High speed dodging just doesn't seem to be in the cards, contrary to what was shown in the trailer.",

Why did I want to tumble through space doing bounties and moving cargo? The story is flat out bland and totally uninteresting, with a typical 'avenge my father who the baddies killed' revenge plot (and one of the most rigid and uninspiring protagonists I have ever seen in any game, and the supporting characters are worse by several great orders of magnitude), and the lack of true player enterprise in the sandbox give you no reason to want to progress in this game. Sure, you buy bigger ships and do bigger missions, but what then? Can I take political control of systems and build my own faction? No. Can I buy property and create a business empire and compete with other traders or corporations? No. All the player can really do is just fly missions and shoot stuff, and then get bigger ships to fly bigger missions and shoot bigger stuff.  The developers are great, and really work hard (and continue to do so), and I really wish I could give this a positive review, but the fact of the matter is the game is just 'meh' on most accounts. Without anything to really motivate me all I could do was let my mind drift to the impression that I was just in a giant empty MMO were I had to play by the AI factions' rules.

Once again, I spend money on a steam game and am treated to crushing disappointment. There needs to be actual unbiased reviews about the games on steam because it seems to me the only reviews I've seen are misplaced positivity.   First of all, the travel system itself is less than slow, it literally feels like I aged 20 years to get from point A to point B. The 'fast travel' is a bunch of stargates set up that cost a butt load of credits to go through. Last I checked, it was free in any other sci-fi universe/game to go through mysterious portals to the unknown/known parts of space.  Further diminishing my experience was the combat system. Slow...agonizingly slow. I'm pretty sure when people want to play a single player sandboxy type of game, they expect a sci-fi fantasy to be a SCI-FI FANTASY. Fightercraft should be able to annihilate eachother in seconds, not minutes, or what seemed to me like hours. That sort of time should be reserved for large ships capable of dealing as much damage as they can take. Not to mention the horrible amount of time it takes in the game to make any credits at all. Oh boy, just finished a mission that almost got me killed-what!? only 17,000 credits? Well at least I'll be able to pay for lunch. (Next tier ships are at least 12 times that amount, not including upgrades and new systems/weapons.)  Story is bad...nough said. Unless you want to argue with the 'positive' reviews from the esteemed critics like the Escapist....really? You said the game is good? Well I know for sure Yahtzee wasn't the one who wrote the review because honestly I think he'd agree with me that this game is a stinking pile of elephant dung waiting to be carved into a slightly smaller, yet some how even more smelly, pile of dung. And let's not forget the gems. Everyone likes to have their stinky pile of dung encrusted with the jewels of a king who painted a brilliant picture of even more elephant dung. Oh, but the setting is in space! How exciting! I'm sure I'd love to fly around in a massive piece of space dung as long as it looked pretty!  The graphics are nice...but that is all.  Worse voice acting than Darkstar One.  There isn't a lot of customizability either. Ship classes and sizes range from petty-clunking-piece of space dung to giant piece of space dung, but with glasses so as to let you know it's the father of the bunch. Weapons come in a small amount of flavors. You have the shooty speedy laser lights known as railguns which you can barely see because apparently they shoot faster than light and do next to no damage. Next are the beam weapons which have their own subflavors of electricity, less electricity, and holy s*** there's so much electricity I can't even see what I'm shooting at. Which btw, I can't see an enemy ship unless I'm hugging their balls and by the time I can fire a missle at them, it might as well be shooting a fly with a watermelon, but don't fret because this watermelon will most definitly hit the fly because of guidance systems built into the watermelon itself.  Explosions are also completely rediculous. If I'm fighting a large cruiser and I blow it up, I expect the explosion to fit the variant of the ship and it's systems. Instead, I'm treated to a super nova that kills my speakers (and ears), temporarily blinds me, and...the ship is still intact, allthough now instead of being called 'Super Mega Death Killer' It is instead refered to by the game as 'Derelict' Not Derelict Ship/Cruiser, just derelict. Oh but there's more! Indeed, if you shoot at the thing you were fighting just a minute ago, you'll spend another 10 minutes widdling away at its health bar until it finally explodes again. This time, you get access to the loot inside the ship and the model has completely vanished with no trace of debris. How boring...  At any rate, I should have expected this from some random gaming group I never heard of nor seen any of their work because they don't offer demos. I'd ask for a refund, but I know how Lord Gaben is about the 'No Refund' policy. So there you have it. A complete waste of time and money, though if you do buy the game and no life it enough, I'm sure one year later when you've completely forgotten about your friends and the fact that you even exsist, you'll have gained all the credits, mercenaries, and access to top of the line ships and equipment...which, as far as the leveling system goes for you and the enemy, will blow up in half a second due to the extreme damage output of whatever enemy you're fighting.",

The game is supposed to be a space sim. but mostly it feels like the Joystick controls are slapped on like an afterthought. Ofc. you can use your Cyborg X just fine, but you will have to aim with the mouse on the side?! I am allways surprised how little attention the joystick interface in some of these games, after all they are trying to 'simulate' flight right? And if you do want to ues the joystick without the mouse you will have to place the mouse in the center off the screen after every single popup, and that gets tedious very very fast.  Furthermore in combat the ai sometimes just stop flying all together at just sit there shooting at you well i guess because it can.  I havent played a lot of the campaign but i will just say that after the 3 mission they try to sway you to go back to freeroam, so dont buy it for the story.  I dont know a lot more about this game though cause frankly im done with it, but if you are looking for a sandbox space arcade game this might be ok i guess, no promisses tho.",

The game seems to suffer from major balance issues and design flaws.   The class system doesn't really contribute much to the gameplay as the only difference between the three classes are 4 skills which hardly seem to affect gameplay other than an animation on activating a skill.   Regarding balance, I've played all three classes in campaign and freeroam mode and once you reach around level 12 the game seems to go out of sync with what your character is able to do. All combat missions have enemies rated as 'Impossible' to defeat and unless there happens to be friendlies in the area you're pretty much doomed. It also seems impossible to stay alive longer than a few seconds in hostile space as you'll be swarmed by enemies against which you stand no chance. So the sandbox is in reality confined to space in the vicinity of friendly stations.  Combat is clunky as most of the time you'll be battling the camera view instead of the enemies who will be off-screen for the majority of the fight. This means that manual combat isn't an option.  Making money to buy better ships is also a bit of a chore as it takes forever to make the roughly 2 million credits you'll need to buy your first decent ship. What seems to be the fastest way to make some money is by boarding and selling enemy ships which is also made almost impossible by friendly NPCs tending to blow up the ship you're trying to capture with all your troops on board.  All in all I'm rather disappointed to be so let down by this game as on the surface it really has the potential to be excellent.",

            "review_text": "This is a game with much promise, but little to recommend it. It has a massive universe, but it is mostly a boring, empty grindfest.  The main issue is that the designers simply haven't bothered to balance out the various elements of the game. While missions are on offer, they don't actually provide anywhere near the sort of money that you will need in order to upgrade to newer vessels. And you do need to upgrade, because the game difficulty assumes that, so let go any dreams you might have of having any real choice over the sort of ships that you choose to play.   Because of this, players are forced into the incredibly boring and highly yawnworthy process of capturing ships for sale, just so that they can earn decent income. What this means in practice is that rather than wandering around the universe engaging in exciting dogfights (Freelancer did this well), you are forced to try to capture the first ship you come across (although it might just be destroyed by 'friendlies', who don't care that your marines are aboard).   From there, you grapple and ferry the thing back to the nearest starport. Rinse and repeat ad nauseum. Of course, you could trade, or you could mine, but these are equally boring activities and if you wanted to be an accountant, you could easily do that in real life.   Thus far, the designers have shown absolutely no interest in addressing these issues. which is surprising, because they are a widespread criticism and would be easy to fix, simply by upping the cash rewards for missions, while significantly reducing the amount that players earnt from selling captured ships.   By comparison, at level five I might earn 12,000 credits for a mission, but over ten times that from the sale of a captured ship. Why not just make it the other way around? Afterall, how much is a ship full of holes really worth anyway?  As one other reviewer said, this is a game that doesn't get fun until you have at least ten million credits. Sure, if you are the sort of person who loves highly repetitive, routine actions, then you will probably be in your element. But then again, you are probably already an IRL accountant anyway... ;-)  The other really crappy thing is that there isn't really much out there to explain the 'classes' and what all of those skills and perks really do in the game.   All in all, this is a very bland and uninteresting game and if you are looking for lots of boredom, or need something to keep you occupied while you read your book, in between overly long flight from one boring location to another, then it might just be your cup of tea.  Personally, I don't want to have to grind for hours just to get to some decent content. At which point the grinding recommences.   Even after more than ten years, Freelancer (especially modded) is easily the better game.",
