            "review_text": "Pahelika puts you in the shoes of a man finding a magical book and set on the trail of a mighty one used by a king to defeat his evil enemy.  The game is a little adventure one, you find objects, you combine with others, you use them and you solve some puzzles (sliders, codes, jigsaws, etc..). You visit different 'worlds' (fairies, ice, an old wizard's tower, etc...). While the gameplay is well balanced, there is however a big problem with Pahelika.  It's a problem of hitbox. I was trying to put an object where it should have been to see it being refused. I was on the glittering zone but nothing was working, unless I click a little more above or a little more under. Also, it was not always easy to understand what to do.  I was even stuck at one moment because I couldn't find the switch, that was so tiny, that I thought that the game was bugged. I did a new profile and I wasn't stopped, yet, I realized that sometimes, it was not easy to spot. I don't know for you but when you have to rely on a walkthrough because you're tired of some non-sense, it's not satisfying. I mean, Pahelika falls into the category of games where I feel like I don't need to look for a guide - it's been like that since I play casual games. And having to look for the walkthrough on the Internet is frustrating.  The graphics and the soundtrack are correct, the story is told like a comic, which is a nice feature.... though the guy you're incarnating is different from the header on Steam and drawn in the cutscenes.  Anyway, I can't really recommend this game. Despite a good gameplay, I didn't quite enjoy the game like I should have if it was more polished.",
