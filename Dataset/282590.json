            "review_text": "I do not even know where to begin. There are some amazing ideas in this game, and it seems a lot of polish even during early access. The diplomacy is unique and very complex, with influence and interactions that feel very very real. The planetary resource systems are fascinating to me, as is the resulting trade networks that grow organically. The ship builder is actually better than the first Star Ruler, which had an amazing ship builder. FTL was weak in Star Ruler 1, here there are 5 different methods each unique and tactical. Combat seems solid, manageable, and interesting. The flagship system means that you are ordering around fleets, not ships, but you still have a nice amount of control and the ship numbers are amazing. Everything is . . . perfect.  I'm a highly critical gamer with jaded tastes. I've been disappointed by one 4x game after another. MoO3, Endless Space, Sword of the Stars 2, all sad memories. Even Galciv and Distant Worlds weren't quite good enough for me. I have never been so completely blown away just playing a tutorial, realizing the depth of the systems I'm seeing laid out in front of me. Assuming there is nothing horribly wrong with this game that is hidden from me currently . . . well damn, I'll say it, this might be the game that surpasses Master of Orion 2.  It's an overused cliche, but it fits with this game. Things could go wrong, the AI may turn out to be useless, or some other chronic mistake, but I don't think so. Star Ruler 1 was visionary and flawed, fascinating but clunky. It seems they learned a lot from that game. Seeing this come from a small studio . . . I hope it gains the accolades it deserves. I also suspect modding will be amazing, since Star Ruler 1 had a wonderful modding scope, and I suspect they did the same here.  Buy this game. No seriously, if you like 4x gaming at all, buy Star Ruler 2. This isn't a game you buy just to support the ideas of the devs, though those ideas are amazing. This is the game I wish I had paid more for, because I think I cheated the devs and got way more than I paid for.  :::Post-release:::  The game remains very strong, with several major improvements over the beta. The ship design remains the high point of the game, and sadly the AI remains a little weak. The AI is competent, certainly. It does know how to play the game properly, but it lacks aggression. On the other hand, it is smart enough to know when it has lost.   I won a game recently without actually taking a single enemy planet. I out-expanded them slightly, and while they fought wars against each other, I offered surrender to whichever side was near to losing. Most of them accepted subjugation, since I was a friendly power that was roughly 10 times their strength. After I did this three times, I turned on the one remaining AI. I declared war, sent my massive ships. Three of my ships arrived in their systems and I received an offer of surrender before they could reach the planet. I think they just saw the ships blotting out the sun and said 'Nope, this is not winnable.' That is smart design and saved me a long slog to a certain victory.  Recent improvements to the tech tree have made it far more understandable and elegant. Technology in general seems far more unique and useful as compared to the beta tech tree, which was somewhat repetitive. Performance remains very good, I've yet to see a bug or crash in any of my games. The races and various FTL methods have vastly improved from the beta, and the AI knows how to play every combination without error.  The modding community is rapidly expanding, as predicted, and has already furnished several very solid mods. The devs have already incorporated some of the best additions as core gameplay, which does not surprise me. I still recommend this game highly, it remains a very original and solid 4x game. I have high hopes for the future, and I do feel they have delivered a solid game as it currently stands. Of course, I always yearn for more.",

            "review_text": "Star Ruler 2 is an innovative 4x space strategy game that focuses on macro scale and the management of a whole stellar empire. I must admit I am positively impressed by this game, in fact, so much, that it convinced me to write my first steam review.  Disclaimer: I won the game in a contest organized by  spacesector.com  I try to be as objective as possible but the fact that I didn't pay for the game might affect my judgement, therefore I mention that, just to be honest.  The positives: - Hands down the best diplomacy/politics system in 4x game I've seen. The diplomacy and politics is conducted via cards that you can buy or use with influence (which is an in-game resource). The cards can be used to various benefits, like buffing your planets or ships, or getting a short term empire-wide bonuses, or even forcing opponents to cede their planets or systems. This system is surprisingly deep and enjoyable and really makes you feel like a leader of an empire, mettling with galaxywide affairs. - Great sense of scale. The empires are big and depending on map, they can spread across several galaxies. You can build a battleship the size of a star. Nothing holds you really. - Clear and interesting economy system. Economy in SR2 is all about creating a supply chain of goods, to develop your planets. While your empire might consist of hundreds of planets, just a couple of them can get developed to a high level and be really relevant as commerce hubs, research centers or factory worlds. That system is both deep and not too overwhelming. There is a degree of automation, and while you have means to affect that, the worlds mostly develop by themselves. Considering the scale, the management of your empire is rather intuitive and pleasant. - The degree of freedom. You can create planets and even whole solar systems. You can design your ships freely.  The ones that depend on your perspective: - The game can become complicated. It streamlines and automates plenty of things, but sheer scale might be overwhelming at times, especially that it is not turn-based but real time. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of everything. That might however not be a problem to veterans of the genre. - Technologies are mostly passive upgrades. It has a big advantage, because that means you don't have to refit your ships everytime you research something new, however they are by no means as interesting and meaningful as the system of MoO2.  - The combat system is focused on macromanagement. While it's not bad as some claim, you are not just ordering 2 blobs to fight each other, you can't order singular ships. It has plenty of mechanics that must be taken into account like logistics, ship design and their orders. However the battles on tactical level fight by themselves. You are just dispatching fleets, not really fighting battles. - Some aspects of the game are not explained well. The game is deep as I said and there are a lot of underlying mechanics, just some of which are covered in tutorial. It has a steep learning curve (which I guess should be expected) and in your first matches you'll probably don't know what you are doing. Not a big deal for vets I guess though.  The negatives: - The game lacks personality of lets say MoO2. I feel the races are dull and not distinctive. While they differ a lot when it comes to mechanics and are interesting on that level, all have access to the same ship designs and technology, they don't communicate with you, don't taunt you. Also there are no admirals or governors.   All in all I wholeheartedly recommend it. It's pretty stellar :)",

            "review_text": "Hello there!  So, Star ruler 2... You know, when i saw this game on steam the first time i got really excited, for good reasons.  I loved the first game and this game was a nice face-lift for sure by the looks of things (and it is) when i looked it up.  So the moment i was able to i bought it and joined the game in EA. And at first I was actually a little disapointed,  it was kinda different from the first game. If you as me played star ruler 1,  I really liked commanding large fleets or big and small ships induvidually.  And the fact that you can't do that in the same manner in this game is what caused that disapointment.  It scared me, because i felt it could potentially make the game 'to easy' to control.   In time however, I honestly can say i changed my opinion rather quickly,  by the simple fact and realization that playing a game of star ruler 2. Especially multiplayer against/with  the devs, aka devastation fridays &amp; of course normal multiplayer.  Things can quickly get not only complex but a bit hectic lol (in a good and satisfying way!!).   What you will get is this; - From management of planets on a macro level, import/export of wares from planet to planet (To gain more resources, population buy leveling up planets and their population cap etc)  - Planet managing on the micro level, Building planet structures, ships, stations etc. (To improve everything from construction capacity, research gain, resource control etc)   - The new (and awesome) diplomacy card integration. There is a lot to this in the game. Basically this is a card mini game where you aquire all kinds of diplomatic cards/powers by spending diplomatic points your empire generates. Cards varies from influence cards that gives you more of a say 'say' or power in voting. For excample - if you want to annex a planet (or a whole system!),  from another player 'legaly' without an actual war declared. You can do that!  But only if you have the stronger diplomatic strength than the other guy. So if player A wants player B's planet and A has the diplomatic advantage. He or she would get the planet.  However everyone in the game can vote. So if player C, D, E etc. decides to mess up players A's plan, they could vote in Favor of player B - and thus denying player A's campaign to capture player B's planet. There are also other things like adding food production to a planet, renaming planets (gaining bonuses doing so) etc etc.   - Ship designing, as before you can design ships but this time around its more fleshed out. And beyond the fact they are using a hexagonic design system. whatever you design and built - the icons for the ships will look exactly like the designs you make from above. Though the ship graphical models themselves are 'preset' to whatever  You chose when the game starts, which is fine in my opinion.  Do note there is a random ship generator for certain ship types too!  !! Keep in mind, you can design ships 'out of game' with the design editor, you can find this in the main menu.  You can even test your designs there as well!.  - And back to my innitial dislike of the ship management... lol Im honestly greatful the way it is. It would have been just be to much (for me) to handle if you had the ability to control every single ship manually. The way it is now. you have Flagships, support ships and stations. Flagships and stations controls the support ships. To a point as they are limited to support command point limits and ammo storage (if you dont have enough ammo you'll find yourself with a fleet that cant shoot rather quickly xD). Flagships are basically the only controllable and movable ship you have. That's the core of your fleets, when you add support ships (smaller ships typically), they simply follow the flagship around until it's destroyed (where any surviving support ships either flies to the nearest planet or sits still in space till they are killed (or another friendly flagship arrives). Similar setup for stations, but yea, they are stations so you don't move them around exactly.  - And lastly the economics and research. There are 5 types of economical resources. First of which i mentioned,  the diplomatic power. We also have money, energy, research and FTL.   Starting with the money system. Although the game is in real time. The money is gained on a turn kind of basis. The economics of money cycles around via a timer. Every time the timer runs out, the current state of your coffers updates with it. So if you are supposed to gain more money then you will by the end of 'it's turn'. But if you lets say start to colonize planets, your income will also take a downward turn as you basically take population from established planets (and thus resource generation). And place it somewhere else.  At which point the old things needs to recover slowly and regain the population back up again. Or maybe you built a new ship with high maintainence (or station etc)  The other 4 resources are realtime generated.  * FTL is used by your FTL method of travling. If you use a hyperdrive - the hyperdrive will take its power from your FTL storage. If you build a stargate it will cost FTL to activate/build it (but not using it). * Energy is used by various ship modules and world artifacts to activate.  Some artifacts for excample will require 900 energy for you to convert one artifact planetoid to a random resource.  But is also used in various research techs and diplomatic actions as an alternative to the 'normal' methods. * Research ... Enough said * Influence ... With small addition: can be used in some research techs as well  ---------------  All in all, I cant think of much else to say. My innitial fears about this game being 'to simple', haha boy was i wrong.  I just love how it turned out! It's deep, detailed and the costumization power you end up having is really great and  fun to play around with for sure! No game ends up the same really if you start playing around with the different factions, make your own races, set up different world gen parameters. etc etc.  haha I've lost a few games (and won) now due to the fact i just could not keep up with the other players in some areas.  Once I had a vast economic strenght, that i was able to build large and many fleets with. But in the end i lost because my enemies had a strong diplomatic power (that i greatly lacked), they basically took my economy away and thus my feets.  It is sooo easy to make mistakes and that's honestly what i also think is a bonus in a game like this.  The cold war aspect is amazing. And sometimes where you start out in the game can ditermen the entire game and how you yourself end up playing. It makes things more interesting and fun and this really has been a blast playing so far! And i would love to see this franchise grow even further in the future!  I have played a lot of games, been in several betas, alphas and EA games now (as you can see in my library) And this has definitly been one of the best EA games ive had the pleassures of playing along side its development. And now when its released, I can full-heartedly say i love the end product! :)  This 4x space empire game I highly recomend!  Do note, there is a lot of fun to be had with other players! So dont be afraid to talk with others on the IRC chat.  People have been really friendly there so far and there is always someone willing to play.  Have fun and fly safe o7 !  ",

            "review_text": "First, if you liked the first Star Ruler, understand this is different. They are almost two different games entirely, of which both have merits. Personally I favor this one.  To me, this is good. It reminds me of a refurbished Space Empires, but toned down in a rather unique, yet rewarding way.  The empire structure and development leads to an impressive way to build and manage your empire, leaving many questions to how to balance your Diplomacy, Research and finaces for Fleets and Defense well. All and all, I think it is a good way to limit and balance the game to which its not easy to be overpowered without paying for it - and it rewards you well once you are. It also alows basic levels of Terraforming from worlds that produce Labor, letting you determine a sizeable portion of that empire's structure, but the biggest and key parts still get left to fall under RNG and planet generation to actually make those particular worlds so you can use them. Sometimes the RNG doesn't let a game have many of certain higher level world resource types be around, making the game slant some in its gameplay, but that's really a minor gripe in smaller matches with less systems and worlds. The more planets availible, the more options so its kind of a moot point - but it does bring up performance issues in the game if oyu have TOO much around.  Diplomacy here is also done with a bit of a unique twist, using cards to determine actions and votes in a galactic senate that follow a simple yes-no flip. The Diplomatic actions are determined by a resource earned that needs to be spent to use it. That resource is determined by your empire's worlds and you can help determine how well it is. Its part of that determining faction to your empire if you focus on it being more influential, warlike or economic. But you need to find a balance so its not overwhelmed if you break out in war with another empire that outseps you on another front.  The ship/station design mechanic has been heavily refurbished since the first SR, and I would argue also in a much better way. Ship classes are either Support or Flagships leading the supports in default fleets. Each ship has limited Internal Component totals you need to balance how you build it. Do you make it a massive, slow-moving single weapon, split up for variety of damage types or build it to speed across the galaxy at will? You need to balance that as it limits how much room you have left for other parts. Armor is largely left out, so long as its external, letting you make really tough vessels, but that weight has its own costs. Flagships also need to manage supplies for themselves and the fleet, as well as control to keep and maange support ships for additional firepower. Stations are much like that, but can also have their own defese forces and fleets. Each ship aslo comes with their own patterns for attack strategys and behaviors, letting you mix and manage how your fleets are built and operate. Close quarters brawling with alot of firepower? Or do you skirmish as a whole, just out of the enemy main weapons range? I just love the whole list of options here.  Even with its restrictions, it is balanced remarkably well. But you need to udnerstand that there are limits. You can't go all out, you have to play by the game's rules and learn them well. But it does reward you well for getting it.  I think its a good game, well done and crafted to its own well-balanced rules and gameplay. One I can enjoy and regard well for doing it so. A definite reccomendation from me.",

            "review_text": "My one regret about Star Ruler 2 is the lack of publicity it has gotten so far.  Star Ruler 2 is a very well made and polished game with several unique features that all come together quite convincingly. I'd say much more so than Star Ruler 1 ever accomplished.  The game focuses on the macro side of empire maangement but you can still build key facilities on planets and plan out your empire in some detail. The best new feature of the game is definitely the empire growth side of things. In essence, you are trying to advance a few key planets by supporting them with many less developed ones. It creates a very intricate chain of supply and demand that is also nicely automated enough that it doesn't get tedious.  Diplomacy is very well done and actually a big part of the game. This is the first diplomacy system in a long time that I wanted to dig into. There are diplomatic actions not only by competing empires, but by the general galactic community as a whole. And each faction gets to vote, and attempt to sway votes from other factions as well.  The combat and ship building have been redone and are now very much more coherent. Combat hinges on massive flagships supported by multiple smaller ships which can play differing roles and tactics in combat.  There is a lot more to the game, but I'll just stop here and say that this is a title very much worth checking out if you like 4x RTS games or just space empire games in general. Give Star Ruler 2 a try. You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "This game has a great many creative ideas and new approaches, but fails to explain them well. If you like climbing a learning cliff, it's the game for you. If you want something that you can dive into, with a friendly programmed-learning approach that makes play enjoyable, pick another title.  There is a tutorial, but you better find the key control how to pause the real-time clock (see ESC-options-keybinds) before you start. Furthermore, do not experiment in the tutorial. You might do something that prevents you from finishing it. Also expect a few totally alien terms that are poorly selected for communicating a concept. If it sounds weird, just mentally map the game's term (such as 'pressure') to a more familiar one (such as 'limit').  There is no manual for looking things up. There is a wiki, but it's only got 18 pages, some with just a few sentences. Expect to learn primarily through trial and error. This is especially true when it comes to pros and cons of various research options, ship design, bio-cultural variations, etc. You can try to ask questions in the Steam discussion, but expect to be trolled by people who invested a lot of time learning the game, and want to justify it by belittling you.  On the plus side, developing an imperial economy inevitably creates weak spots in your empire. The bigger you get, the harder it is to manage and defend, which is a nice game mechanic. However, trying to re-jigger which planets support which other planets can quickly become a nightmare of back-tracing support routes, planet by planet, across dozens of interlocking multi-planet systems.  On the minus side, like most games on this scale, you have no control over fleets in battle. The best you can do is give each ship design (not individual ship captains) 'standing orders' to stay back or go in, and whether to go after the enemies powerful enemies, or weaker rear area support or 'artillery' ships.  If this were the only grand-strategy game of galatic empires in the last five years, it would be worth struggling with and learning. However, there are plenty of fresh concepts in this field, and plenty of easier-to-learn games. I didn't find the enjoyment available in Star Ruler 2 is worth the time and frustration of learning it.",

I love it, it feels a lot like Space Empires V, a particularly awesome game that no longer runs on my PC despite my best efforts.   You can fully customize ships, and not just adding on things to a pre-set design, you get to make the design itself.  The Tech tree is expansive, though could always go with an even bigger one. You can have multiple galaxies in the same game. You can blow up galaxies, blackholes, stars, and planets. Many different types of planets.  Pretty much a really good 4x game.",

The planet leveling is awesome but can be a little annoying becuase its hard to get more than like 2 or 3 planets to level 4 or above because of the shear amount of resources needed to do this. That is not a bad thing in and of itself but can be annoying when you need a water resource and you have 12 and those 12 feed the 3 level 3 planets and the 5 level 2 planets. its a good game though and i very much enjoy it. I am not a pro 4Xer but this is one of my favorites. Distant worlds is a great game too but it is getting very dated with the graphics. Also Sins of a solar empire is awesome but it is also very dated.",

            "review_text": "Star Ruler 2 is a unique spin on the whole 4X RTS genre that uses some new mechanics that I havn't seen before. Essentially, The game is a 4X RTS game with a whole new spin in the mechanical design. When you think 4X, you think of games such as Master Of Orion 2, Galactic Civilization, etc. These games all seem to be completely similar to each other (Mainly because most are based off of Master Of Orion, which was the most sucessful of it's genre in it's time). They all use turn based gameplay with turnbased combat, research was done by a turn by turn basis, ship movement was also turn based and so on and so on.   Star Ruler 2 does a unique spin on the original concept by making research based off how much of a certain resource you have, Planets need to import and export in order to be sucessful and lucrative, using a mechanic called pressure. Pressure is a varying counter that the higher it is, the more the planet produces and the more money you get. By importing certain resources, you can change pressure and the benefits it provides (For example, a resource might provide research pressure, which will increase your research resource on the planet in question).   There is also a very unique diplomacy system that uses 'Influence'. Influence allows you to buy and activate what is essentially cards. You can use these cards in votes, diplomatic agreeements with alien civilizations, or to benefit your civilization itself. You gain influence by the system above, with the use of pressure.  There is quite a large research tree, but a lot of the research just seems to be passive bonus' (Things like 20% more weapon damage, 20% more energy, etc) that doesn't have a whole lot of new things you can unlock, like new weapon systems, ship systems, buildings, and so on.   The game has a energy system that is, once again, affected by pressure that is producing energy. You can use this energy to purchase certain research projects, activate artifacts which give large bonus', and to use for certain diplomacy cards.   Star Ruler 2 has a system that is quite similar to normal 4X games with the idea of labor. Labor is essentially a planet's production that affects how fast something is built at said planet.  The game has a interesting ship design mechanic that allows you to make things like star sized ships and the like.  There is many many more things that can be said about this game, but now I will list a few negatives I find about it.  - Not a whole lot of variablity in how a ship looks, Sadly, unlike Galactic Civilization, this game doesn't allow you to customize the look of a ship  -Sometimes I found the enemy AI to be a little weird, as in, they declare war but I never seen them attack me. They essentially declared war on me just to lose. I only saw a fleet of theres maybe once, before it just jumped out of the star system.  -Why does a planet only produce 1 resource on average? How can a planet only just produce grain and meat, while another planet can only produce coal?   - Not a whole lot of race variety, and I havn't seen much of a story for the game, asside from a little bit of fluff on the race selection screen.  Thats about it. Overall, I sincerely recommend this game for a unique spin on the whole 4X genre.",

I recommend trying out both if you can -- the first is rougher around the edges, with more complicated mechanics and a more difficult learning curve, while this one is streamlined in intelligent ways. Although there are a few options that aren't on the table in SR2 as a result, SR2's still got plenty of scope for unique and interesting ship design and fleet combat, which is now based around a 'Command' flagship, of any design you like, and a support fleet of smaller ships, which is a wonderful way of simplifying the control of complex fleet combat.",

Star Ruler 2 however, simplifies the experience, makes game fun and enjoyable.  However: 1. There is no empire building as such - it is kept at kindergarden level, which is sad. 2. There are still crashes from time to time, which is sad - but game is playable this time. 3. Diplimacy seems to be a Pollock's painting - there is no logic to it, which ruins immersion slightly. 4. There are not enough artistry in this game. That;s what made HOMM popular (plus AI) - amount of hand-drawn stuff. Here, there are still to many square, hexagons and other cheaty programming shortcuts to UI.  Pros: 1. Combat is real fun. 2. Ship designer is real fun.  So-sos: 1. Exploration seems to be a dangerous chore without any spark in it, bit is otherwise OK. 2. Planet management has no depth to it - remove complexity, yes, but removes fun as well. 3. UI was improved drastically since first version, but not enough. It is still ugly in places.  Overall, I recommend this game - maybe you won't spend countless hours in it, but at least you would see and enjoy something different.",

What a change to the genre norm.  Great refresh on the 4X them. The Diplomacy system is the best I have seen in any game and the Ship building experience is on the right track (a few quality of life changes away from being epic). The planet management, both micro (city development) and macro (planet resource graph), is held back by its UI. Once war hits, it is also hard to figure out what broke and most of my games end with being too lazy to figure out how to fix my network of resources so I live with a negative budget and try to end the game with whatever fleet I have.   I enjoy the early game so much that I don't mind that the end game is made unmanagable because of the UI. I hope the next version puts its focus on improving the UI and adding more auto-management tools *while* sticking with their current machanincs (city development being the exception that could use a redesign).

I had been looking for a good 4x game with a modern spin, but the current batch of popular 4x games just re-hash the same old mechanics that have been around since the dawn of 4x; the constant min-maxing, end-turn clicking, and save/reload experience that, to me, turn 4x games into something other than a game. They lose any kind of action feel and quickly the ADD kicks in; I'm moving on to something else.  Along comes Star Ruler 2, a 4x game in a sense, but more, with an additional RTS element allowing you to fully control time. It sounds novel and has probably been done in some other game(s) I'm not aware of. But it is expertly done in this game, to the point that I would like to tip my hat to the developers with a rare post of admiration. Truly, the thought put into the overall design is pretty genius. From the endless setup options, fully 3D galaxies, orbiting planets, ship designer and sandbox tester, the built in community page and IRC, tab UI functions, to the very awesome, imo, space battles. And even better, it all seems to be coded well; I have yet to experience any issues.  In the end it appears this game was put together by gamers and lovers of 4x, RTS, and space sims; they melded those genres very well into the fabric of this game.  ADD will not affect this one for quite some time...lol.",

You might be asking yourself, 'What does this game do differently that makes it worth my while?' Well, in short, it’s not “yet another bad Masters of Orion clone”, It’s not “Civilization IN SPACE!” and it's not Sword of the Stars 2.   What this game is, and I really stress this, is unique. While I have had a hard time getting into it (a fault of my own as you can’t simply zone out and play this like any other space 4x), it’s by far the most refreshing take on the genre yet. To go into great depth about why it's unique would make for a very long review but to have a few examples:  * You can rebuild ancient wrecks and turn the war around, as if you were playing a space RPG from the perspective of the ragtag empire suddenly getting the heroic lead character’s assistance with the Ancient Relic Warship of Destruction.  * And following on with that thought, said warship can then be used to blow up the supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy, obliterating the galactic core. Rival empire spiraling out of control? Not anymore.  * You can spend political capital to rename your flagship. This inspires your people. Yes, renaming your flagship to “LongflongActual.” is inspiring.  * You can convince the galactic council that a planet inside a rival empire should belong to you, and they will vote and agree on it, even as the rival in question desperately tries to stop it going through.  * Someone put a bill into the galactic council encouraging research? The highest voter gets an extra bonus ontop of it. Watch as all the players race to be the most supportive of a bill that already helps them because only one can be at the top.  All this, and more, because the core product has modding support and steam workshop integration. These are both great for the longevity of Star Ruler 2, and I'm certain this expansion will be the same.  Now, you might be asking, what’s bad about Star Ruler 2? By being unique you will need to learn, and it can be a steep climb at that. You will need to be patient and want to explore something new but the wonderful dev’s behind this game have extensive tooltips and help to smooth that over. Can’t get the help you need or find it not enough? There is even an ingame IRC client you can connect to with no fuss from within game and ask.   Get Star Ruler 2, and while it might date this review to say this, get it even with Stellaris on the horizon if you are comparing the two. This is A Good Game right now. A pleasant, solid reimagining of a genre filled with the wrecks and broken remains of so many alternatives.  And it really never gets old to turn galactic politics into a wonderful game of “who’s bill do I ruin next?”",
