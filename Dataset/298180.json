Constructed by an unmanned research vessel sent from Earth, the Lun Infinus station was designed to run simulations for a five year period, exploring possibilities of human colonization in the case that Earth became uninhabitable.",

            "review_text": "Though Scott Cawthon is known for making Five Nights at Freddys, it isn't the only gem he has made as The Desolate Hope is another piece of work that is as good as FNAF. Best way to describeThe Desolate Hope is Megaman/Metroid meets the timed battle system you would find in a JRPG, complete with nice looking pre-rendered backgrounds and characters. Bought the game after seeing it was on sale. Needless to say, it was worth the $1.24 spent on it.   Most of the time, you'll be controlling an autonomous coffee-pot, entering the simulations of AI's in the day, and the surface of a planet at night. Within the simulations, the gameplay centers on the likes similar to Metroid and Megaman, jumping over pits and shooting bad guys. When it comes to fighting bosses however, control switches to the four AI's, switching perspective towards that of a JRPG like Final Fantasy VII. Combat as the AI's at first will seem a bit intimidating at first but once you understand each moves the AI's have, you can try to steer the odds to your end, so as long as you pick the right skills. Levelling up the AI's is also rather simple as the night segments as the coffee pot lets you find certain items to give to the AI's, allowing them to level up as opposed to the grinding you'd find in other RPG's.   Though Scott Cawthon's fame may lie with Five Nights at Freddys, The Desolate Hope is another gem of Cawthon's work, one that is good mixture a platforming, turn-based fights, and artistic design.  tl;dr The Desolate Hope is a gem from Cawthon like FNAF, but instead of evil animatronics, it's platforming, turn-based fights like FFVII, and nice pre-rendered scenery.",

            "review_text": "This game has a lot of charm and feels like a relic of 90's western PC games. It has fantastic music, and fantastic gameplay elements that all mesh together, from platforming to RPG action.  Unfortunately, it also runs like a relic from the 90's; there's no other settings other than making the game take over full screen and changing resolution, even disabling Windows Aero. There's even no pause as well, which seems terrible, given how pressed for time the game will put on you. And to top it off, pressing the Esc key will close the game. If only the game was built a little better, this would be perfect.  But if you want to have fun for manner hours besides that, this is the game for you, at such a very reasonable price.",

I am finding it hard to describe The Desolate Hope, however I do know it is definitely not a game for everybody. You play as an AI placed in a robotic coffee machine capable of movement. You are tasked with assisting the other older robots in riding there simulations of a harmful computer virus, while discovering pieces of the truth along the way.   The Desolate Hope is now free on Steam for you to try if you find the game interesting. From the creator of the Five Nights at Freddy's series, The Desolate Hope is most definitely one of the most unique games I have seen in quite some time.",

            "review_text": "Still working on finishing the game at this time of writing this, on the home stretch currently.  This is a curious little title, with unusual characters, setting, premise, among other things. You play as an AI from a video game system being repurposed for exterminating digital viruses, and you have a physical body on loan from a space station's coffee machine. The stated goal is to purge the viruses springing up in the simulations some of the robots on the planetary outpost/station which other AIs before you have generally failed. To do so, you need to work on numerous layers of your surroundings. As fair warning, this game really doesn't hold your hand, but does give you some room to experiment and learn what it is exactly that you need to do and how.  As for genre, it's pretty hard to classify this as any single genre as it's a mashup of several, while not feeling particularly broken. There's meatspace (physical space, rather), where it's closest to an adventure title similar to King's Quest, in that you have direct control over a character with limited actions rather than click and point like, say, Monkey Island 1-3. In simulations, it's more of a platformer/shooter, to sum it up. When you get into the source code segments (I don't recall the exact explanation to what these are, though I'm sure the game mentions it somewhere early on) it's more adventure/shooter like the original Legend of Zelda. And when you fight bosses, it's sort of an Active Time Battle RPG but also upwards of 5 or 6 games going on at once, and this is where the game may be completely overwhelming while also being an amazing spectacle.   It's almost beyond words to describe boss fights, I suppose the closest is what 80s movies predicted games in the 90's to be like? Either way, very unique, in a positive way. Character designs are also wonderful and range from beauty in simplicity to visually overwhelming and I love them all, honestly. The audio is pleasant and mostly appropriate for each area and segment, the game also does a great job of setting up just how grim the situation is without explicitly stating it.  For criticisms, the game has pacing issues similar to a roller coaster, slow build up before going extremely fast until the bottom of the next hill. As for graphics, very subjective to whether folks will like them, I find em charming personally, but some may not enjoy the mid 90's-style pre-rendered sprites and animations akin to Donkey Kong Country. Difficulty for each part of game is also VERY drastically different, which can cause a little bit of whiplash. I apologize in advance if there is a manual that explains everything somewhere, but there's parts of the game and characters that feel as though there's probably context given in something extraneously, such as in a manual with a little blurb about the character and maybe backstory, but there's quite a few NPCs who seem to just be there with the only context being 'Hey, this NPC performs function X or sells Y or sells Z for a small fortune.'  Overall, it's a rather unique experience and I'd suggest folks give it a fair shake. I've enjoyed what I've played thus far, and hope others enjoy it as well!",
