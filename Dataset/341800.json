            "review_text": "Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game.   Maybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.  Maybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?  Lack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.  Lack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.  Frustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or 'cheap' than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.  Brevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.  Cost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.  Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.",

            "review_text": "Concept: 10/10 Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is an asymmetrical party game for 2 or more players, where one person defuses a bomb, while everyone else tells them what to do. Pretty innovative, yet a natural fit for its genre. Also, you only need one copy of the game for as many players as you want, which gives it great value.  Gameplay: 38/40 The game doesn't waste any time getting to the action. The game feels tense right from the first bomb, even if you end up with plenty of time left. The defuser's job is to tell the experts what kind of wiring and such is on the bomb, and the experts look them up in the manual. The experts then tell the defuser what to do to disarm each module. Usually the game consists of a series of questions and instructions. This might sound boring to some people, but the modules are very well designed to make it fun. They range from simple wires that require going through a list of options until you get to the correct one, to 'who's on first' modules that require careful enunciation. The modules that are the least interesting also take the least time. I think most people would progress in skill quickly, but fortunately, so does the game. There are quite a number of scenarios that excellently pace the players through all the mechanics, and each one is procedurally generated. There's also a custom bomb mode that could provide theoretically endless hours. One would think that the game would become repetitive, but it literally takes five minutes, so it never feels grindy. The one thing I could see to improve the game would simply be more modules. But there's certainly enough as it is.  Aesthetic: 20/20 The game isn't the most realistic looking, but it's in that zone and feels super appropriate. Everything looks nice, there's no extraneous clutter, and the sounds are perfectly suited to the atmosphere. The details are nice too; occasionally the lights will turn off for a few seconds, but the lit screens on the bomb stay visible. Great job here.  Length: 9/10 While the game provides a mountain of different possibilities, it does have a limit. That limit won't be reached for a long time, but it's there. It's kind of like a Rubik's cube: once you've mastered it, then you can only refine your skills. But it has like ten times the fun and complexity of a Rubik's cube.  Technical: 20/20 The game runs smoothly. I haven't run into any bugs whatsoever, and the manual is easily available online as a pdf, a webpage, or printed. The controls are tight. Not much to say when there's nothing wrong. :)  Total: 97/100 Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is one of the best games I've picked up this year. It's simple, but that simplicity is one of it's strengths. It's a pure rendition of a great idea, and will surely bring a lot of laughter and yelling.",
