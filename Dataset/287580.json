            "review_text": "To all turn-based strategy, 4x lovers (such as myself), I  highly recommend this game . It's the best thing out before the release of Sid Meier's: Beyond Earth.   Anyone who is wondering what this game is like, I'll give you a brief idea on what it is like by saying that it feels like Civilization V with a few major differences, such as:   1.  Random tech trees for each faction  - you also discover new technologies after every era you pass through, to give a sense of wonder of the future  2.  Unit stacks  - infinite number of units per tile; like Civilization IV's stacks of death. The game has actually balanced it so that attacking with stacks is less beneficial; bombardments hurt all units within a stack, flanking (putting units next to each other in separate tiles) gives an attack/defensive bonus.  3.  Customisable units  - yes, you have a unit workshop and can fit different weapons/bonuses/abilities on them. There are a lot of different chassis to research (e.g. infantry, fast-attack vehicle, tank, watercraft, and more).  4.  Planet wildlife  - at the beginning of the game, they are not hostile. However, the wildlife can get more and more aggressive if factions fight against them, or produce a lot of pollution. They may then become the equivalant of barbarians, or even worse (if aggressive enough, they can launch a full-scale invasion on humans, threatening everyone. It could prove to be a good tactic, for militaristic players, to annoy the local wildlife so that peaceful players are threatened with annihilation). There are multiple types of wildlife, ranging from practically harmless little xenomorph drones to gigantic aquatic monstrosities.  5.  City management  - it works something like this; morale (happiness) is local, rather than national. Local morale has an affect on local growth, and local growth depends on whether or not you have enough food stockpiled (food pool is national). Growth is also affected by habitable space; if you don't have enough space, migration to other cities (ones which have more habitable space) will occur. Production requires minerals (also stockpiled nationally). If you run out of minerals, production will be hindered but not stopped completely. Science is gathered normally (1 scientist = +1 science). There are buildings, natural resources and tile improvements which produce percentage increases and/or a small increase in that stat. You can also move your citizen's roles (there are four roles; farmer (food resource collector), miner (mineral resource collector), worker (city producer) and scientist (science producer)) around manually, and they will automatically go to the highest yielding tile. There are other factors as well (such as wars, pollution etc), but that's just the gist of it.  6.  Alien invasion  - around turn 200 (normal pace), an alien force (size depends on how difficult you set difficulty level/alien aggression level) invades the planet and the world has to rally together to fight them off. It's a nice twist and a breath of fresh air, especially if the local wildlife is almost extinct by that time or if you have been playing a peaceful game up until that time.  In addition, the game's presentation is very nice (introduction video, graphics, artwork, quote voice overs), soundtrack is great, UI is intuitive and smooth, optimisation is smooth as well; never lags or crashes (runs a lot better than Civilization V). The game is, amazingly, roughly 500MB, so it's a very fast download.   What can I say which is bad about the game? Well, currently, the game has more focus on combat than Civilization. The game still needs, in my opinion, to add more content which aligns the player to a more non-combat style of gameplay (e.g. something similar to culture with wonders). There are multiple victory conditions other than conquest, such as economic and research victories, but it'd be nice to have more. There is also no indication of how far ahead you are when compared with your opponents, until the last few turns before your, or your opponent's, imminent victory, warning the player.   The good news is that the developers have pledged to add more content to Pandora: First Contact, maybe in the form of expansions, if it proves to be successful. So far I think the game has been successful, hence the Steam release (the game was released months before Steam).    EDIT (7th August 2014) : Just as I said before, they have continued updating the game to make it better and they have recently announced the first expansion pack, 'Pandora: Eclipse of Nashira', to the game which adds espionage, better diplomacy, better aquatic gameplay (sea tile improvements etc), new factions and more.  For people hoping this to be the next Alpha Centauri, I wouldn't get your hopes too high. The game is good, and it is very similar to AC in some respects, but it's not exactly the same (e.g. no mind worms). Judge it for what it is. I played a lot of AC back in the day, and I thoroughly enjoy this game for what it is.  If you're still not convinced, or somewhat unsure whether or not to pay for the full price of £22 or $36, just wait for the eventual sale. I'd definitely call you mad for not getting it then.",

            "review_text": "This is a solid game in its niche marked of 4x games, and more specifically, 4x games with space age human colonization. With its only direct competitor being the blatant AAA cash-in Civ: Beyond Earth, it is clear that this dev does not have much to compete against.  Let's start with the bad, because everyone else starts with the good, and I'm a unique and interesting individual, as well as a special snowflake, so I go out of my way to be different in ways that try to be clever but miss the mark entirely.  Bad: -Lack of diversity and depth This has been said since the beginning, and it still applies. Units lack variety, game mechanics are simplistic, factions are flaccid copies of their Alpha Centauri counterparts, and buildings have few functions. The game replaces real depth and variety with gimmicks like the Messari Invasion and the Nashira Eclipse (both paid-for DLC, of course), which get old and tired quickly.  There are only a few types of military unit: Infantry, Scout Vehicle, Tank, Mech, Helicopter, Boat, and Artillery. All factions have the exact same units, with the exception of the Messari, who have their own units, and the aliens, who also have their own units. Units all have a linear upgrade path of three tiers, corresponding with the three epochs of the tech tree. These units have Attack, Defense, Rank, Movement, and Health stats. These stats are boosted by a linear path of weapon and armor equipment, as well as gadgets, which are not linear and each grant unique abilities to the unit. The narrow scope and linear progression limit gameplay options and make unit customization a chore rather than the fun and interesting experience it should be. It also makes war less interesting. There is also little reason to have any meaningful combined arms force. There is no bonus or strategic incentive to have a variety of different types of units. This means, in theory, if you have an army of only scout vehicles against an army of helicopters, infantry, tanks, and artillery, you will win given you have the numbers, which is not at all realistic or interesting.  There are three kinds of combat: direct attack, artillery strike, and orbital strike. You will have no meaningful use of air force (since the only air unit in the game functions the same as the ground units), unit supply/logistics, morale, or other such thing that would add depth and realism to warfare.  There seems to be absolutely no effort on the part of the developers to add real depth to the game as they clearly favor gimmicks that sound cool and people will buy just because they sound cool.  -Limited Diplomacy Diplomacy is very limited in this game. It very much comes down to agreeing not to attack each other, attacking each other, and open borders. Anything else is too hard to achieve or too useless to mention. People will complain that the AI puts too much emphasis on another faction's military power, but I have no problem with this, as it adds a competitive edge to the game as well as gives it some semblance of realism (let's be honest; when you have an ideology different from everyone else's and a ♥♥♥♥ poor military, even the Gaians would want to gobble you up.) However, I do agree that it is too simplistic in this regard. You get no sense of geopolitics, where the different factions would take into account supply and demand for resources, the layout of the land, etc. What you get is a sense that you're surrounded by countries each led by a schoolyard bully, and the only way to win is by being the biggest bully in the playground.  -Lack of mod tools/support The devs champoined their use of the .xml format in making the game more customizable, but anyone who has attempted to mod this game will quickly discover that there is only so much you can do with them. You can change stats, you can add new techs, and other small things. But there is no way to change the UI, there is no way to make meshes/models for new units unless you have programming knowledge and patience for navigating the xml's mess of verticy coordinates, or other actually useful things if you're serious about modding. This game is not friendly to modding to any significant extent.  -Blatant cash milking As mentioned above, depth is replaced by gimmicks. These gimmicks come in the form of DLC that you pay for. They add nothing of substance to the game. The weak espionage system introduced in the latest expansion is also little more than a gimmick.  Pros: -Solid mechanics The game suffers from few bugs, and there is no game-breaking mechanic to make this unplayable. It's not the most fun, but it's not completely unplayable.  -Well designed atmosphere The music, sound effects, art style, the factions, the alien life, all flow together fairly well. At first glance, it can actually be impressive. And even when that inevitable point in time comes when you get bored with it and it becomes old (because it does get old), it's at least not intolerable.  -Comprehensive UI Unlike other games (*cough* Beyond Earth), this UI is informative and not invasive. Nothing is hidden from you. However, there is an issue with the game encyclopedia being limited to things that you've already discovered, which is frustrating for anyone who's done more than three playthroughs.  Conclusion: This game's selling point is that it's the spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri. It very much uses the reputation of Alpha Centauri as a crutch to keep it standing, rather than standing on its own merit, which is actually quite mediocre. And of course, the devs don't plan on doing anything about this. Aside from the devs' love of gimmicky DLC, they also love to handle a bunch of projects at the same time, ensuring that none of them get the TLC they need to be worth any significant amount of time or effort. After all, why stick to a game to make improvements and developments when you can crank out half-baked cool ideas and make more sales?",

I find a computer city on turn 7... and they have 3 units already, while I'm 10 turns from building my first.  On medium, I'm fighting some computer players, and winning, but I notice that they're literally building a military unit every turn, sometimes two a turn. This is funny because they only have 2 cities, one of which was just founded. In my cities these same units take 6-18 turns to build.  In a later game, on easy difficulty this time, I get to turn 100-150 or so, and suddenly 3 enemy states declare war on me and then commence attacking me with 30-50 units. They had fewer cities than me, and somehow were producing units 2-3x faster than me.  On the other side it has some interesting concepts/tech/unit customization, but the computers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in their strength and the amount that they cheat to make the game 'even'",

            "review_text": "I frankly wasn't expecting anything more than a bland generic Civilization or a bland generic Alpha Centauri...  And indeed, the game is pretty much a generic Alpha Centauri. But it's much more well made than I imagined it would be. The presentation is pretty good, the interface might not be the most beautiful one in the world but it is polished and functional, the tooltips are truly helpful, ingame information is easy to find, etc.  The semi-random tech tree is pretty big, with each research unlocking one specific item (a building, operation, project, unit part or such). Research seems to be quick overall, so are you constantly getting new stuff in small increments.  I tend to dislike unit customization in 4x games; more often than not that's just busywork. I enjoy the way customization works here, though, some of the pieces you unlock give you interesting specialized units.  But more importantly, I think, is that ultimately what bores from other 4x games and make me go back to Civilization (or to Grand Strategy games) is the AI. There are a number of 4x games out there that are extremely polished and sleek, with interesting and well designed system... but ultimately I grow bored of them rather quickly because the AI doesn't seem to have any clue whatsoever about the game. It's like I'm playing alone in a sandbox, no matter the difficulty. As much as the AI of CivV is criticized, it at least tries to win and to interact with the player.  From what I could gather, Pandora is now being patched by a person from the community, who has been focusing on AI improvements. Obviously I haven't played a lot of it yet, but from the matches I've played, I really enjoyed the AI behavior I saw (except perhaps by how quickly they changed their mind regarding diplomatic agreements) - it seemed to react really well to what was happening around it, I felt like I was having an actual impact in the game world instead of playing by myself while the AIs played by themselves.  Bottom line is: Pandora is giving me the 'one more turn' vibe that non-Civilization 4Xs almost never manage to give me. The fact that there are decisions to be made almost every couple of turns (instead of long dull periods) and the fact that the AI seems to be really trying to compete with me are what collaborate to this, I think.",

It also runs EXTREMELY smooth and shows that some developers still care for optimization, which I value most in games. Thus many grats to this German studio. This game adds its unique tech and eco system combined with a refined global resource system from Warlock: MotA. It also adds Operations, which are mostly global skills like scans, upgrades or damage which either are on cooldown or must be produced in cities.  However, you only get about 60 - 70% of the original AC and less if you add Alien Crossfire. You have only 6 leaders instead of 7 (however noone misses Lal, that crazy space Ghandi), you do not have a diplomatic victory as far as I now. I don't know if there is advanced terraforming or sea cities available, but the water areas appear rather dull. These are points the future add-ons should adress to reach the full AC experience. Support the game, the price is pretty reasonable for a fresh 4x game.",

The research is randomized, not as in, you get diferent research options per game, but rather, your most important research can show up in the begining or at the end of the tier which makes this a restart game if the tree looks awfull. Much like when you are placed in a desert in the start, 'playable but dont expect to win'.  Your oponent show up rather close to you or not at all, again making restarting the game quite high, and yes you have to go back to main menu, not like civ that gives the option to reload if begining conditions are not decent.  It is more a war game than anything else which is good except for the fact that the game boils down into 1. who has the better tech tree? who has the best starting area? and Who is not getting attacked? which ussually mean that the factions that have combat bonuses ussually dominate.  yea the imperium has acheived a domination victory before any race reached tier 2 in the tech tree (mechanized era).  Unlike civ where going on an early conquest gives you a bad rep with every other faction (warmonger) but it also causes a very unhappy populace. Not here, going nuts killing your neighboor is the most efective way to win.

Its certainly not a bad game, and I can't point to any specific part of the game that I don't like. It just didn't really excite me either. It could just be that this isn't really my kind of game. I've played a few 4X turn based strategy games, and I do tend to enjoy them, but its not my favourite genre and I'm also not a highly skilled player.  If you've played Alpha Centauri, then you can stop reading now, because PFC is pretty much exactly the same game, but with different faction names. If you've played any of the Civilization series, PFC is pretty much Civ on an alien planet with future tech. You can decide whether to buy PFC based off your experiences with those games.  PFC has all the standard 4X mechanics. Choose between 6 playable factions, create cities and construct buildings to improve your empire's level of food, research, production, gold, happiness and pollution. Train and upgrade military units, and then either wipe everyone out for a military victory or stay defensive and go for a technology or economic victory.  The two biggest differences compared to other 4X's are firstly the tech tree has a randomised layout with each new game. This is either good because every campaign will be unique, or bad because you can't pre-plan your strategy, depending on your point of view. And secondly, food and production is stored at empire level, meaning you can have a city producing zero food, focused entirely on research/gold/production/whatever and your people won't starve because they get food from other cities.  I played two full campaigns which took 9-10 hours each. I didn't encounter any bugs in game, but I have noticed that some achievements are bugged (I should have unlocked 2 faction wins and the medium world size win).  Ultimately I think fans of the genre will probably enjoy Pandora, but if you've never played a 4X before I think there are better games you should start with.",

There is also an in-game market for resources, reacting to players' actions.  The gameplay is solid, the game itself runs smoothly on my not-optimal laptop, and the download is ridiculously thin compared to other games. The graphics are pretty nice, with colourful terrain, distinct improvements, units are varied and simply awesome (especially the towering mechs), and you even get to use a Black Hole Generator. I bought this game and haven't regretted it.  ",

The manual was a bad start enough, with a poorly researched pretentious setting. But then, they pour it over inside the game. Reading most of the quotes chosen to illustrate the events, I can't help but feel like I am being trolled. And if that was supposed to be a satire, it is quite off the mark as well.  Prolly not the most helpful review if you do not give a crap about the setting in your 4X, as there might be a game in there - but I won't spend any more time looking for it.",

            "review_text": "After playing through several games of this, I'm convinced this game probably should've been made closer to an RTS or something.  While it contains a great many features that are reminiscient of your standard 'Civilization' formula, I find that the majority of them seem to be redundant and often don't seem to carry relevence to the game itself. There's a feature to design your own units, but in general there's really just a linear 'upgrade' path with most other options not working out well.  As a player of old time classics like Alpha Centauri, Master of Orion, and the original Civilization games, I was actually impressed to find a lot of neat features and customization capabilities that reminded me of the old days. The problem is that the way the game is designed, these features don't seem to mean much. There's pretty much only one way to go, and that's to be as warfare driven as possible.  Maybe I just haven't quite -got- the hang of it otherwise, but diplomacy seems unrefined and war is utterly unavoidable no matter what kind of victory you're aiming for. I've not been able to survive a single game without investing heavily in warfare, often at the expense of everything else, due to the combat driven AI.  The one and only game I ever managed to create any sort of 'peace', it had pretty much become a Cold War of just building more and more combat units, just to prevent war. While there was literally no space left to expand otherwise. Maybe this is an artistic statement, in a sense. When all the land is taken, there's no other choice than to kill your brother for his land.  All in all, I would only recommend this game if you prefer your Civ-style games be more action-packed and are prone to combat oriented games. Otherwise, you might prefer to wait until Civilization: Beyond Earth for your Alpha Centauri spiritual successor.",

            "review_text": "I was really looking forward to this game, but was sadly dissapointed. Even on the easiest level if you are not prepared for the alien invasion then you are in trouble. The aliens become aggressive too early in my opinion even when playing with the threat level at its lowest.  After about 3 restarts I tried a new tactic of early expansion. I rushed to get my second city as close as possible, after that everything started booming. I spammed out lots of troops and cleared my island of aliens just through sheer force. But this style of gameplay is not what I wanted. It seemed to me that the only way to thrive is to get a good starting location and rush straight towards your second city.  The game was not as good as I was hoping. It lacks balance, even with all the settings at their lowest if you do not prepare for the alien invasion you will be crushed. Pollution and overcrowding can quickly turn things sour. My biggest concern is that unless you play a specific way, you wont get far in the game. I can imagine it becoming very repetitive, very quickly.   Overall: the game did not accomodate my playstyle and just lacked something for me.",

They were told the 'manual' (a series of stories about the factions, which would be awesome if it also had gameplay basics included) was written under the assumption that you already know how to play a '4X' game, and to rely on the gameplay tips given in game.

I've only won once, and it was on a match where I had no other bots. You'd expect people who had their previous home destroyed and forced onto an hostile alien planet would try and band together to work, but even when they're on your own team they are reluctant to help. It's near impossible to keep morale up cause you run out of food and minerals quicky and your habitat runs out all too soon as well, not to mention if you even try to build a nice mine, farm, or even a luxury condo (ha ha just kidding,) the local wildlife, which some call the other factions, will gladly rip them up and toss them aside, and don't even get me STARTED on the damn aliens. Try and defend your area and then eventually everything will adapt to your own defences and, say for example you have equipment that allows you to kill soft, fleshy opponents, they'll bring in machines, lets say that you have machines, they'll bring in missles and other equipment that is useful agianst them. Now don't mistake me for 'WAHHHHH I WANT TO BE STWONG!' or some ♥♥♥♥, I enjoy a challenge, I really do, but this is almost impossible to win cause, surprise, everything wants to kill you or wants you dead, as I can guess on your teammates if you decide to put people on teams...  Now to be honest, the game is kinda fun, but if you're expecting to last past everyone else, pray to RNG jesus to give you a good, defendable area and hope the much stronger aliens/factions have a really hard time getting to you, which I assure you, they wont.",
