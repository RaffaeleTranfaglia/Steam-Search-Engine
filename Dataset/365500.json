For the sadistic developer who brought this monster alive with so much LÃ–VE ?  I know why...  First, because it's intense. Either you in or either you're out, but if you're in, you'll really be in...  And second, because it made me have this particular feeling that I wasn't playing the game, but the game was playing with me.  I'm still trying to beat the third song, but the first time I played it, I couldn't help to smile ridiculously because this music and these colors made me soooo happy.  This game is full of joy, and the last song is like ecstasy.  The only drawback is that you may become dependent really fast. There is only three songs at the moment, and once you're done with them, you'll be craving for more. But the developer said he was working on this...",
