There's this amazing world, all this lore that already exists, interesting story and characters. But the combat is just pathetic. I have no idea what the hell I'm even playing. It's like real time combat where you have to use action points like in the older Fallout games or Wasteland 2. EVERYTHING, but the combat, is amazing. But since the combat is such a vital part of the game I can't recommend Game of Thrones. I watched the entire show and read some of the books but story can only get you so far.  It's a damn shame.",

Dont be fooled by all those rewiewers which quitted after 10 mins if you like mature story-driven RPGs and/or are a fan of the books you'll love this.  The best story i've ever seen in a videogame, (and i'm quite into storydriven) if you read the books you'll surely notice Martin's touch :), the dialogues and the main charaters are also excellent, the choice system is one of the best i've seen and the choiches are truly meaningful... what more can i say? Yeah it also last quite longer than other modern rpgs it took almost 30 hours to me to finish my first playthrough and i also skipped a few secondary missions.   The combat was criticized as one of the weak point of this title but is actually quite good, a bit repetitive and boring at the start while you unlock new techniques and moves it truly start to shine.. a few hours into the game it's already very satisfying, it also require you to play it tactically and on knight (medium) difficulty it's already truly challenging and unforgiving in later stages.  The graphics are good enough when maxed, expecially the lights effects, for some reasons some of the most common (medium) armor in the games seems low tex  Sadly there a few aspects where clearly emerge that the devs were short of money like repeating models and bad voice actors for common npcs (the voice actors for the protagonist and others main characters are very good though) and some other unpolished aspects but these are really minor drawbacks in an overall memorable experience.. also with all the choices and the class sistem there surely enough material for second or third playthrough.  In the end i still consider this one of the best RPGs i've had the pleasure to play, if you are a fan of the books and/or mature story driven games this is truly a must buy.",

Everyone says the control are horrible, but it is literally WASD movement with a resident evil over the shoulder camera. Switch party members by pushing tab. In combat, its like an mmo, where you auto attack and have a hotbar full of skills to use. You can push space bar and the game goes into slow motion, allowing you to be very strategic with combat and use your party members to their full extent.   Honestly if you had issues with the controls in this game you will have issues with the controls in a lot of games, because they are very simple and intuitive. I would imagine everyone complaining is using a controller, and then it might be more difficult, but its a joy on keyboard/mouse.   The story runs parallel with the books/show, so you are playing alongside important events in the world. It really is a lot of fun seeing the world from other points of view if you have read the books or seen the show. The character creation and leveling up has depth, it is a lot like an old school rpg. It has a smattering of dungeons and dragons, in that you get to pick your stats and skills.   All in all, great game, great rpg. Not the best, and a bit dated graphics wise, but that barely puts a dent in it. Would recommend.",

            "review_text": "This is a *must* if you are both a fan of RPGs and Game of Thrones alike.  You play as two completely independant characters - Alester and Mors. Alester is royalty, while Mors has 'taken the black', living a life alongside an army defending all mankind from any and all threats that may lie beyond an enormous ice structure known as 'the wall'. The motives of these two characters differ on many important points, and this game is a journey to discover how their paths affect one another. Knowledge of the TV series or books is not a prerequisite to enjoying this game, but it certainly is a perk.  Now, I seriously discourage anyone from buying this that has a habit of skipping cutscenes and dialog. Cutscenes and role-playing dialog are more than 50% of this game’s true content. It’s essentially an interactive 25+ hour movie, written by George RR Martin himself. The story is deep, the acting ranges from passable to superb, and it all absolutely ties in to the lore of the TV show. You make dialog decisions that can and will affect the outcome of the game, and in many cases, affect the outcome of your present mission. Almost every fight can be talked out of, if you care to figure out how to calm the person you’re speaking to. Adversely, you could tell the angry person to shut their mouth and prepare for a beating, if you wish.  Combat is cool-down style, and fights can be slowed down to bullet-time to make tactical decisions, which you will be doing A LOT. Auto-attacking will get you killed, period. You must use buffs and special attacks which are unlocked with XP, which is gained by completing missions, discovering new areas, and defeating enemies.  Standard RPG fanfare such as inventory, loot, bartering, side-quests, open-world exploration, hidden items, character leveling, upgrades, stats, potions, and armor &amp; weapon slots are all present as well.

If you are just looking for a solid RPG tital then perhaps try else where, or pick this game up during a steam sale if you have a few bucks to spare. You'll easily get an entertaining 30 hours out of the game with the DLC.  Over all, it was an OK game with sub par gameplay but with an above average story with interesting characters.

The game offers a really nice story where to get to play as Mors, a member of the Nights Watch and Alester, a red priest and each with their own interesting backgrounds. What really impressed me was how the story progressed and really chocked me sometimes, there's always going to happen something that you did not expect. One thing that really bugged me however was that the choices you make (and you'll be making alot) didn't have that much of an impact in the story, it felt like they added choices just to have more dialogue. Another thing is the voice acting, Some are good, Some are bad, Most of the time when characters talk to eachother it feels more like they're just saying their line instead of actually talking.  The combat is also something that could have used some more work, I found it hard to effectively switch targets in realtime and some abilities are just overpowered. However they did make it alot about interupting attacks and combining attacks between characters which I really enjoyed.  Overall I would say that the game was definatly worth the money and time and I would gladly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Game of Thrones or RPG.",

The graphics and animations are bad, the combat is boring and repetive, the environments are bland, and most of the voice acting is grating. It's almost funny how some of the characters are endearing despite looking and sounding like crap. The one saving grace is the traits system, which actually rewards (or punishes) you via stat buffs/debuffs depending on what choices you make throughout the story.  This game is almost worth playing thru for the story, but you would probably be better off reading a synopsis or watching a Let's Play video. As it stands, it's a 4/10 pass for this one.",

The combat in this game isn't as refined but it isn't half-♥♥♥♥♥. I found myself enjoying the many skill combinations that allowed me to mete out death to my many opponents. The graphics aren't as good as other games released in 2012 but they are good in their own right, i personally loved how the heavy armors looked. Very imposing, very powerful and lord-like.  I dislike the fact that you cannot replay the chapters or any of the missions at all without starting a new game and the fact that there is no new game+ option. Such a shame, i would have loved to explore other decisions in specific chapters in game without having to replay the whole thing again. The idle animations default to that one pose where the hand is on the hip for some reason, it looks awkward as the player character and many of the npc ones shift from a talking animation to the hand+hip idle every 2 seconds.  All in all, i recommend this game for the story and the enjoyment i got out of it and i think you will enjoy the game as well despite the flaws it has. Get it in a bundle or on sale, doesn't matter.

The reviews of this game were pretty mediocre and I knew that going in, however I thought playing it knowing of it's dodgy quality would somehow make me tolerant of it's shortcomings. I was wrong.  In the main, it was the voice acting and dialogue which killed this game for me, I just couldn't get over how bad it is. Does that sound snobbish? Perhaps... but when every conversation had me wincing internally... I knew I wouldn't be able to plough through this game.   That said, in my opinion I think the combat is actually worse. It is a kind of real time, MMORPG style combat reminiscent of World of Warcraft. You queue up actions and attacks with special abilities taking up 'energy', while standard attacks can be laid upon your enemies forever. There is no blocking animations or reactions to being hit, they just chop and hack away at one another until one falls down... very much like the early MMORPGs. The only difference to the formula here is you can hold in space bar to slow the game down to a crawl, like a real time active pause.. should you feel the need to do so.  Special attacks might hit multiple enemies or add a status effect like 'stun' or 'bleeding' but it is really unsatisfying. Those of you who like that kind of combat... I'd say you should still steer clear of this. I played WoW for years and believe me when I say whatever itch that game scratches with it's combat... Game of Thrones doesn't.  These two elements alone were enough for me to abandon Game of Thrones only a hour in. Some may argue I hadn't given it a chance... but to be honest first impressions stick with me when it comes to games, mainly because there are just so so so many others in my collection that I could be spending my finite free time on. Perhaps that is shallow... but I suppose I'm so long in the tooth as a gamer now, you just know when a game isn't going to improve.  So be warned...

This means youre basically standing still creating sequences of attacks before you even know what the oppenent is going to do - almost like rock, paper, scissors.

I recommend playing if you have some time to kill (25 hours or so), and are looking for a good story which attempts to tie into the Season 1 Game of Thrones universe.

We have two main characters with separate storylines and motives, but they will be forced to take part in the political events. The atmosphere is very bleak, treachery lurks everywhere.

But if only you'll stay a bit longer, hopefully you'll find yourself in the story's grip. The graphics will still be awful, but servicable. Combat will pick up a bit though once you'll learn more skills and get more stamina to use them - it will still be a bit boring as it's very tactical and focues on disabling and exploiting enemies (at higher difficulty levels it's very challenging).

You have to balance inflicting status effects (on fire, stunned, knocked down, etc.) with matching extra powered attacks while always saving a bit of power to throw in an interrupt. You're often controlling 2 characters (and sometimes also a dog), so there is a lot of room for strategy. Like most real-time-with-pause systems though, the fights always devolve into a big pile of guys bouncing all over the place.  The story is really about as good as it gets for something like this. It all takes place before the show starts and focuses on new characters who often run into characters from the show. The writing is ok, and the story is interesting. Some of the side quests are fun.  There are a lot of negatives though. Some of the quest are really wonky - you have to basically try every dialogue option. It seemed like a crap-shoot to figure out the best dialogue option. The results were just too random.   The visuals are all over the place. The main two character's faces look great, but some of the cast members are almost unrecognizable. The texture quality is often pretty bad. For example, the doors look like something from a 10-year-old game: just a flat texture on a very thin bit of polygons. Like, the handles are never modeled making them look really out of place. Tree, flowers, etc. often look terrible. Oh, it's also worth mentioning that the game is over-the-shoulder third-person, so it can be a real pain to look around. As far as I could tell there was no first-person 'look' option. The FOV was really low, as well.  The difficulty curve is a bit off. Most fights were easy, even many 'elite' or 'boss' fights, but a few were suddenly extremely difficult.   In the end, Game of Thrones RPG is a fun little game that fans of the show can get some fun out of.

The story in itself is very good, though the game is no where near as polished as it should be.   The combat can be clunky as whilst it isnt turn based (You assign skills in a slowed down real time), it can be very repetitive and there are often clipping issues where the characters will either occupy the same space or 'vibrate' when they are standing half inside a wall. The system itself though is pretty easy to master once you understand the roles of each character (I always use Mors as a Landed knight and so he 'tanks' whilst Alester can damage the enemy)  The quest system can be frustrating too if you are new to RPG's as if you miss a slight detail, you will pretty much fail the side quests. Most of the side quests can be completed over several chapters, but if you miss a specific pickup that starts the quest in the chapter where it has become available then you won't be able to complete the quest once you have moved on in the story. This can be awkward for achievment hunters.   I do wonder how this story would have turned out if it had been developed by a bigger studio, as it is clear that the writers have tried to keep everything in keeping with the lore of Westeros. It does kind of feel like this game was made by a company who snapped up the license before anyone else could and then they rushed to push out the game to cash in.   All of that being said, if you are a fan of Game of Thrones and old style RPG's then I would recommend you buy this just for one playthrough. If you arent happy with slow turn based combat and linear levels, then I simply would not. I would also say that this game is not worth the full price and you should wait until you see it on sale somewhere.   ",

If you are a fan of ASoIaF and RPGs (and who isn't really?), getting it should be a no-brainer.   The game is a stripped down version of a Bioware-style RPG with a focus on a linear and tight narrative. The game has very little dialogue and content outside of the main narrative; for example, the only rewards for exploration of the often large areas are coin and lore entries, both being fairly insubstantial.   Typical RPG elements in this game like tactical combat and character building aren't particularly interesting, but neither are they horribly boring or badly done. But since it is not a strong suit of the game you might want to play on 'casual' to not be bothered too much about it.   The story has a nice flow, with familar themes from the books (or the show) being present while also managing to stand on its own. The game is told in alternating chapters of two different characters, engaging you in different aspects of the story. This is an experience rarely seen in video games, which makes this title stand out.   The dialogues are usually pretty good, but if you expect the same level of wit, sharpness, drama and authenticity as in the books you will be disappointed. This is a narrative RPG, with the main device of narration being cutscene dialogues, so you can expect an unnatural amount of exposition in the dialogues. The voice overs are a mixed bag. The cast is quite good in parts, but some lines are delivered painfully slow and the actors often seem aloof from the situation at hand. You get the impression that each line was recorded separately. (Of course, this is how it was done, but the job of both writers and actors is to keep you from noticing this)  The dialog system itself is similar to the wheel Bioware uses without the responses being pigeonholed into certain personality types. To make the choice between options more clear, the possible responses are worded in a more introspective style, often describing observations about the persons that will inform one's response or flat out stating one's motivation. This is actually a huge improvement over Bioware's use of the system, as it feels more like choosing the character's thought processes than just making a character conform to a personality.   If you are a hardcore fan of ASoIaF you might find some details unbelievable, but for the most part the game's story and dialogues fit fairly well into the setting.  If you ever wondered what a Bioware game would be like, if it was more linear and focussed almost completely on the main narrative, you might want to check this game out.

The Story telling in this game is great, If your a fan of the a Song of Ice and Fire series of books you may well enjoy this game. The Gameplay on the other hand is a bit lackluster, Its not bad but there is something to be desired, the combat is remeniscent of Dragon Age Origins. I give this game an 8/10.",

Story and characterization is it's strength, UI and graphics its weakness, although its autodetect was stupidly conservative on my system.

While it has a storyline that runs through its middle that at times ca be interesting,when not weighed down by pointless lenghty crap and retreading, it suffers from a poor mans combat system,like a second rate Witcher. The voice acting is questionable at best and the game is clearly a cash in on the series. You never really get to explore Westeros. A franchise better suited for more free roaming. I originally thought everyones reaction of it being bad was because they were jaded. I've played a lot of games shunned that turned out good, but this isn't one of them. I ♥♥♥♥ on this title, glad I spent $15.",

What it does NOT: -Sightseeing; You get to be in the interesting locations but you never get a nice view on anything. Despite being in the red keep the only characters you get to met from the series are Cersei and Commander Mormont.  -Convenient pollished game play?; Areas are small, with little detail and riddled with dead ends for you to get lost in. So you will need to look at the map a lot. You can open the map with the key 'm' but only close it again with ESC, which shall serve as just one example of the many annoying little things of this game. Sometimes it feels like I am being tortured...  Nevertheless, I enjoyed playing the game due to the story. ",

It's not a perfect game by a longshot (the graphics are outdated, the voice acting can be pretty bad, the controls are odd, and the combat system isn't groundbreaking), but it's leaps and bounds better than other games that OXM gives a '10 out of 10' to. The fact that this game got such a low rating shows what's wrong with the gaming industry (People who praised 'COD: Ghost's' dog segments hated the dog segments in this game, even thought they're far better).",
