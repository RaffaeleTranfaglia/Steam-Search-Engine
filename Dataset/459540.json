            "review_text": "Hmm, I've only played a little bit. I like the premise, I think I was thinking of the Manwa, Girls of the Wild's. I want to like this game but it feels a little rushed. I guess I was expecting more pics whether it's the girls or the fight part. Almost feels like early access. Would be nice if they patched some more meat into this game. I guess that's what I'm hoping for so I won't ask for a refund. Just needs more artwork, especially at the beginning, feels a little bare, will try to play more during the weekend. And yeah, better save ability pls. I've heard that this is a case of you get what you pay for, so impress me with an extremely good dlc worth buying if your not gonna add more to the game. I guess I want to reluctantly recommend since I'm hoping for more.",

            "review_text": "A fighting training simulation with Girls is a very interesting concept to be created on. In fact this game has a potential to be greatest. Following the previous game, it still maintain it's main concept as simulation game with an additional fighting training simulator.  Pros: - The simulation training system is very interesting and not boring enough - Lot of character and have a different personality, status, and skill for each - Absolutely gorgeous soundtrack (I especially really like this one!) - The Art is beautiful - Variety of status to be train for  Cons: - The battle system is somewhat very unreliable, in this system you only one thing to win and that is LUCK - Even there are so many status, only one status that is worth enough to win every battle and that is STR status - Very luck dependent in term of training and battle system (need Load File repeatedly in order to win) - Conversation choices serve no purpose other than increasing the member trust and integrity - Very short in term of story, only takes 1 hour to complete the whole story (without repeated Load File) - Story is not interesting enough  Even with those lack this game has, this game is worth to be played enough. Well I personally like it's training system rather than battle system and that makes this simulation game worth playing and keep unique.  PS: To the developer of this game, if you can read this, I really hope you release the downloadable official soundtrack for this game (I don't care if it is DLC or not), that thing is the main reason I recommend this game to everyone and makes this game beautiful even with all those lack.",

Long: - There is next to no story.  - What you get to know and HOW you get to now about the girls feels arteficial at best.  (to much i would have to explain so trust me when i say, its realy bad) - Music is average.  - Battle system is underdeveloped (and i understand how it suppost to work). In short, its realy not good.  - The game has some nice artwork, thats the only good think i can say about it.... sorry  You want to play a similar game? search for 'Trillion' its not exactly the same but everything they have in common trillion does MUCH better.",

Run, for your RPG loving life as there is some 'role playing' but it's the simple, I like or disprove of you and not really your fault  shortcomings now get back to training. Lets say a game with random and/or bland girls and simple rpg mechanics (and MORE time between combat) Is worth more than this hack of poker 'game'. Like Monster Rancher. ",
