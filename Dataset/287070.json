            "review_text": "Took me a very long time to realize that this comes pretty close to the old Steel Panthers games.  Steel Panthers used to be my favorite game - in the latter nineties - and I've missed that gameplay a lot, until..  Battle Academy looks different, but the basic gameplay is pretty much the same, especially if you choose the top view. The in game graphics are ok, far better than the majority of rehash wargames, but far from cutting edge. The gui is ancient. However the game play is great, and although Battle Academy is easy to learn and enjoy, it has enough challenge to cater for more hard core wargamers. Note, the game is not about realism, however the tactical gameplay is fun.  Unfortunately BA doesn't come with a skirmish mode, but the core game and dlc offer plenty of play time.  Battle Academy 2 is even better, with its fine tuning, Eastern Front armored clashes and a skirmish mode which ensures replayability.  Nevertheless I can highly recommend the original Battle Academy, but be sure to get the full collection as it saves you a lot of money.",

            "review_text": "Fun little game, but beware the limitations of any turn based system: mobile units such as tank destroyers do not transfer well into turn based system as their entire purpose for existing was to never get into a stand up fight. Allied tanks in general are lacking in their only historical advantage, numbers. Graphics are good and it's well styalized, but not the greatest choice for RTS veterans.",

            "review_text": "I absolutely love the games Slitherine releases and Battle Academy is one of their best product.   Pros; -After playing this many hours on end I still have not completed all the campaigns it has to offer, meaning there is tons of content.  -Easy to learn, hard to master. In other words it's easy to learn how to play the game since it only requires the use of the mouse but there are loads of variables in game that make it hard to effective right off the bat (which occurs at realistic difficult, it is definately the difficulty setting you want to stick to)  - Replayability in the form of Normandy skirmishes + allied special assaignments + axis special assaignments + if you want to restart every campaign from the beginning upon having completed it.  -Sound effects are pretty good in general, love the sound of machine gun fire, rifles shooting, infanrty yelling in their native tounges telling you weather they are suppressed or retreating. They could of done a better job on tank guns however.  -Satisfaction is garenteed when you manage to claw victory from the jaws of defeat, or when you destroy superior german armor with weaker allied armor  -Tanks have realistic armor values, strongest armor up front, weak on sides, weakest at the rear. You can pivot units on a tile so that they face the enemy with their stongest armor.  -Different 'power ups' per level ranging from carpet bombing, to strafing runs, arty strikes, to Medic (being able to heal one dead troop in an infantry squad), to resupply (resupplying AT charges on infantry units that have used them up) etc.  -Different maps with different terrain layout in each level  -LOS mechanic which is fair, if infantry, Fixed AT are in buildings or bushes they are invisible until they fire repeatedly or are spotted by other infantry. Scouts have longer LOS than other units but aren't that great in combat.  -Game braking bugs are non-existant (or rare idk if any one else has run into major problems but my version has run smoothly since I installed it)  -scenarios are not too long nor are they too short, about 20-25 mins per scenarios (there is also a save feature if you want to save the current mission you are playing)  Cons(some may be pros for certain ppl):  -Graphics are hit n miss for some. Meaning some won't mind how it looks while others will find it a bit trash. They're not next gen but they're not that bad.   -Power ups mentioned before like Arty strike, strafing runs , bombing runs do not show which tiles they effect. You need to guess where it's gonna hit and place the markers infront of advancing enemies so that they run into the effected area. Some may take serveral turns before they land which is something to consider.  -Certain sound assets arent great i.e. tanks fireing, tanks engines, truck engines etc.  -Ground forces focus only, you'll never get to fully control Air units or Naval units (you only get to call in air or naval support, you can't control fighter squadrons or ships)  -No base building, you only get the units you choose at the start + reinforcements after several turns(in certain scenarios)  -In game UI isn't great could definately use more work.  -A bit too easy on lower difficulty, and even realistic is a medium challenge at times it does get a lot harder in campaigns like Sea Lion and Market Garden.  -The Game is very pricey to get all these expansion campaigns I suggest you wait for a sale since it's with all the campaigns that the game truely shines (it's lack luster in content in vanilla I found)  Conclusion: If you enjoy wargames this is deffinately a no brainer, if you're new to war games Battle Academy is just as accomedating. So pick it up on sale and you won't regret your purchase!",
