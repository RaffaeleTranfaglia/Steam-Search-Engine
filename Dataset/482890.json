Repetitive and once you get the hang of how things work with eachother its almost like playing a dull clickergame. With some future updates it might get intressting though, so keep it up! :).  pros: -intressting concept  Cons: -repetitive -Too easy once you get the hang of it -",

And only 2 results - good or bad. You are given four control arm, using which you ascend or perish(urban residents raise a revolt and kill you) - yeap, 'More strength - more responsibility'  If this game for you - google 'Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom'. Its game about traders economy.",
