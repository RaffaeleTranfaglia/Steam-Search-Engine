It is a huge improvement compared to basic version of final approach in terms of playability and keeping interest going on. I love the way I can fly the planes, jets and helicopters as if I was flying RC planes, but much more cooler way and in fabulous miniature world! It is quite easy to learn to fly the planes, but all little tasks with the planes and at field keeps interest on. One of my favorite games on VR.  The only downside for this game is slight motion sickness which I develop especially at city airport due to jerkiness, but that is most likely due to my -not-performing-enough-graphics-gard.
