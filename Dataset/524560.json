            "review_text": "A fun game, but not quite the worthy successor to the first; after a rather tense opening act, the story begins to crawl at a snail's pace and never seems to find its steam, not even by the end. Tiptoeing around spoilers, but I was very disappointed when I chose restraint with a certain someone for the sake of someone else, only for the story to shoehorn in a jealousy subplot. It really shattered my illusion of choice in this one, but all in all, I feel it was worth the purchase. I just hope the next Book has better pacing.",
