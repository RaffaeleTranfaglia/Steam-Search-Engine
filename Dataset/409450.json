            "review_text": "I've been playing grid-based RPG's since the 70's starting with the Wizardy series and this is one of the better ones. This dungeon crawler more akin to games like the original Dungeon Master, Black Crypt, Eye of the Beholder, and more recently Legend of Grimrock.   It has all the tropes that those games have but adds two differences. One is a pretty extensive class selection within the tank, healer, mage, and theif roles. Each of those roles has 3 different classes to choose within them and each one has a different ability tree you'll go down. Best yet you can change your class on the fly. So if you find your tank isn't working so well as a Paladin you can just switch over to a Protector class and try that one out.   The other difference is the ability to pause combat.  Typically in these games all fighting is done in real-time. So you're kiting around the monsters and at the same time trying to trigger attacks or cast spells. It's sometimes difficult work. In Dungeon Guardians you can pause the battle, queue up your attacks/heals and then keep fighting.  This actually turns battles more in to toe-to-toe fights where the tank maintaining agro and the healer keeping up with damage is prime importance. But you'll still have instances where you need to menuever out of the way of attacks.  There are some other neat innovations with this game too for the genre. Levels will have both mini-bosses and at the very end of them regular bosses. The boss battles, particularly the ones at the end of the level, are all pretty unique and require different tactics to complete. Thankfully your party will offer up some helpful advice for how the battle might go so you can plan ahead - or you can skip those conversations and go in blind. I have to say the boss battles were all a lot of fun.   As you go through the games 20 levels you're introduced to new monsters each level which keeps things fresh. And every 3 or so levels new tile sets. You'll also start the levels with a blank map. But in each level you can find a map that will fill in automatically. If you really hunt around you can find a second map on the level which will show the entire map, including all the secret areas - although getting in to those secret areas can sometimes be difficult to figure out even when you know where they are.  Each level usually has one big puzzle to solve. These are totally skippable but if you figuring them out you'll be rewarded with some Epic or sometimes Legendary gear that will really help your characters. I for one loved solving the puzzles. Most were pretty creative so we pretty happy when I would find the puzzle room.  The story for the game is somewhat throwaway but I loved the bantering the party does at the start of each level and before the boss battles. It did help to add some flavor to what would normally be generic party members.   The game took me 56 hrs to complete and that was being somewhat of a stickler at trying to find all the hidden areas and solving the optional puzzles. I was really happy with the game overall it's one of the better ones in this dungeon crawler genre. I look forward to the next one.",

            "review_text": "Game starts slowly and it's combat heavy.  The tutorial feels a bit weird with your characters talking to you about the controls, but you need to pay attention at what they say because it's important to understand everything.  Game interest raises when our party gets more abilities and the enemies get stronger, after a couple of levels.  There's a lot going on, so it can be a bit hard to keep track of everything, but it makes the game really challenging with a lot of stuff happening all the time. But there's an active pause to help you to handle all this. Also, there are many helpers in the game options, with auto pauses and other stuff.  You might want to read carefully each ability description as understanding what everything does and how everything works together is essential to beat the strongest monsters.  We have to optimize the damage output, the healing, the damage mitigation and the tank aggro, while watching from tricky attacks of the enemies, so at the hardest difficulty levels, the game is very challenging.  So far, every boss fight has been different for me, each requiring a special and different strategy to beat them and really testing the endurance of my team.  Character building is done little touch after little touch. You won't raise your damage by 50% every 30 minutes in this game. But the party does get stronger with time, and it feels really earned, unlike speedy RPGs.  Exploration is nice as well, but there's almost no puzzles, which is a plus if you're not a big fan of puzzles like me.  You have to find the map in each level to activate the automapping, which is a nice touch for spicying up the exploration, or you can just turn it on in the menus if it gets too hard, up to you.  There's a lot of secrets to find, but they are all in logical places, like dead-ends.  TL;DR: overall, it's an interesting and different take on the classic Dungeon Crawling, with a lot of challenging combat. The experience starts weirdly and slowly but gets deeper level after level. Might not be for every one though.",

            "review_text": "This game is great! It's like old school Might &amp; Magic had a child with WoW. Great old-school first person dungeon crawling with modern character building talent trees. The level design and atmosphere is fantastic, the loot plentiful, and the puzzles won't keep you from finishing the game (they mostly give more loot). There are plenty of ways to build/specialize your characters (a party of 4). Combat isn't square dancing like the Grimrock games, though some movement/positioning is necessary and each boss mob has their own unique attacks. Note: You need to figure out how combat/aggro works before just giving up on the game. Once you 'get' the combat, the game is a blast. One of my favorite the past few years and hope there is a sequel. Can't say enough good things about this game. A must-play for any fan of the genre.  Edit to add: While the combat is real time with pause, there is an optional combat slider so you can slow the combat speed down, which should appeal to the turn-based fans. Also, I recommend turning on the option to make dropped items sparkle so they are easier to see.",

            "review_text": "SUMMARY Fun, tactical dungeon crawler. Differentiates itself with it's tactical combat. Highly recommended for fans of the genre or RPG enthusiasts.   PROS *Great tactical combat, it's real-time but you can pause any time and queue up to 3 commands to each party member. *Combats are tightly balanced on the middle difficulty level (I haven't tried the easier or harder difficulties yet) and you can't auto-pilot through them. You'll need to think and plan a bit.  *12 different classes plus the ability to buy skills in other classes skill trees offers solid replayability.  *Levels are large and reasonably complex. each level is taking me about 90-120 minutes to 'clear'.  *Good options for fine-tuning. The difficulty slider has like eight settings and you can also turn on 'helpers' such as item highlight and automap from start (otherwise you have to find a physical map hidden on each level). I enjoy hunting for the map on each level, but it's nice that the developer included an option for those who may not like doing so.  *Runs fine on my older PC even on the 'fantastic' graphics setting.  CONS *'Fantastic' graphics are actually just good to fair. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to do a cartwheel over either.  *Targeting is not intuitive. I wish it was easier to pick targets for each party member and see what each of my 4 members had as their current target.  *Highlights in combat are meh. In order to see which party member is targetted by a monster you need to mouse over them and the color of the highlight around the monster tells you that party members threat-level. The highlights are not the easiest thing to see  and sometimesI have a hard time telling if monsters in the back row have my tank targeted or not. I'd wish this information was conveyed more effectively.  EDIT: If a character is targeted the frame around their portrait is red, this is easier to see then the highlights on the enemies.  * The artwork for the character portraits is limited. I don't mind the style, but there could be more to choose from. It would have been nice to be able to import my own.  EDIT: It's easy to swap or add portraits with the Modding SDK.  OTHER The game seems to borrow a few ideas from World of Warcraft. Some of the classes and abilities are reminiscent of WoW and the game uses the tank-healer-DPS model that many MMOs have. If you've never played one of these MMOs it may take some getting used to; the concept is a bit different than other dungeon crawls such as Grimrock or the venerable Eye of the Beholder. Personally, I think it works really well and lends the game a unique twist.",

Pros:  Superb looking monsters Difficulty that you can customize Nice level design Skill trees are well thought out for leveling up your characters Puzzles that are optional---I hate puzzles! Reminds me of WOW  Cons:  Can get grindy at times. You can get lost easily in the mazes, but you can turn on the auto map feature even before you find the maps Loot is too randomized...if you complete a hard puzzle or defeat a boss the loot should be unique, not just a better stat booster There are no pirate monkeys in this game and pirate monkeys rule!",

Does appear to have rare drop items (unclear to me yet if truly random or placed specifically on mini-bosses / bosses).  But most importantly having fun with it so far!",

            "review_text": "Fall is an interesting idea, combining tried-and-true Dungeon Master level design with tried-and-true WoW character design, but in action does not come together in an engauging whole.  Unlike in full DM-sourced dungeon crawlers, in Fall, the aggro/automatic/tinker-based combat precludes any and all maneuvering and the ability to take on more than one enemy group at a time. This enforces resting to full, doing the rotations, finding that one trick to snuff that one dangerous ability, throw stats at each other till one party falls, then repeat thruout the dungeon. Character choice is very low ceiling as well, with a full Protection tank and full-time healer necessary past the 2nd diffiiculty level.   Level design is solid, but not particularly great at any time. It does remain a solid highlight, however.  Sound design is weak, with distracting ambience and wierd vocalizations.  It sounds like I'm slagging on this game, but it is At War With Itself and doesn't really excell at other areas to compensate.  Caveat: if you are hungry for another DC (like I was) it's not a waste of your money by any means so enjoy with full knowledge that there are better our there.",

            "review_text": "Gameplay:  This game has a really terrible combat system. Take a MMORPG combat system and glue it to a tile based dungeon crawler and offer no visual feedback for when an enemy gets hit (just a generic dying animation) and you can imagine what you've got here.    Graphics:  The Dungueon does look good at first (flashy lighting and glossy textures) but then you realize that all of the textures are flat, boring, and uninspired. It is not like you actually get to see the graphics though since you will spend most of your time staring at the cool down icons.   Animation:  What animation? The enemies don't even react to being hit. They just swing and shoot at you with same dull, anti-charming animation over and over again.   Value:  I've played for about 20 minutes. I don't want to play this game anymore. I could make this game if I hired a graphic artist for 2 weekends a month and a 3d modler for the same. This game sucks.  You will be displeased 2 minutes into this one.  Interesting Factor:  An off-line RPG with combat ROLES. I wonder if the game designers know that combat roles came about because of limitations a MMOPRG suffers due the latency and the need for a clear cooperation model (Even modern WoW has backed away from this model due to criticisms). The game has no story line and the interest factor is killed immediately upon start of the game when a shinny model of a dungeon caretaker is talking to you while staring blankly ahead and the flow of the game keeps getting interupted by chat boxes that pop-up which pause the game. This game is really bad.  In development there was probably one guy who had too much power dictating to people features of his master plan and not taking suggestions from anyone. Well, it turned out to be a horrible game.    Recommendation:  DON'T BUY THIS GAME (IT IS LESS FUN THAN A RUBIK'S CUBE COVERED IN SHARDS OF GLASS):  Pass on this if you haven't already played Legend of Grimrock. This game seem to be a hodge-podge of the most cheap-to-implement features in the industry most likely due to an end of development rush to finish the game.",
