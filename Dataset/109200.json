            "review_text": "'Endless Fluff' may be an apt description of this game, but not in a bad way. The story is cute, the characters are cute -- even the monsters are cute! But cuteness does not detract from the plot and gameplay. This game actually has an engaging storyline, which one may not expect from what appears to be a basic 'match three' puzzle game. While the puzzle aspects of the game can occasionally become tedious, the story and RPG elements keep you coming back after you die. And I actually do like the RPG elements and the ability to upgrade your various elements in order to perform special attacks when you do 'match' the correct jems together. In all, I do highly recommend this game.",

I did that while having a headache on two occasions and one session lasting until 3am.  As you might guess, I liked it a lot. Then again, I bought it at 75% discount or comparable. If you see such an offer and like match-3 games, give it a shot. If it's got a demo, give that a shot right now.",

            "review_text": "An extremely solid gem matching puzzle game. You use the gather mode to match gems for resources, and then use those in the battle mode on the upper part of the screen. The game's a bit on the easy side for the first leg of the journey as you have little in your repetoire, but once it gets going it's challenging in a pretty fun way. There does exist the problem of unlucky drops meaning you can't get the mana you need, but it's not common enough to be a major complaint.  Getting expert scores in later levels requires gaming the system a bit, but short of one of the more annoying enemy types in one level, it's usually a case of survival against a pretty tough enemy. If anything, I wish the optional bosses had been more difficult, but the endboss is pretty brutal and an excellent fight to end the game on.  All in all, getting 20 solid hours of gameplay out of some puzzle game I picked up for $10 just because it had pretty pictures is an excellent deal. Buy this game. Bonus points: the story's not bad either, taking the pretty grim idea of the fae rather than friendly faeries.",

Instead of the stale narrative of the latter you've got a more heartfelt storyline with a very well fleshed out combat system that covers everything like blocking and dodging to critical attacks. I found this game entertaining and cute as well as a great way to burn time without getting frustrated. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzle games or just wants something different for their combat system!",

The artwork is lovely and the combat system is puzzle based - you arrange blocks in a Bejeweled-style grid and clear them to earn magic points to cast spells. However, the dialogue is a little wooden, like an unpolished translation, and the story is about average. Worth trying if you like the puzzle combat system and can get it on sale.",
