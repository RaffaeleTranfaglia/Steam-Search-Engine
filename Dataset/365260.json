            "review_text": "Reminds me a bit of 'Silent Service 2' in that it's less of a sim and more arcadey in nature, has challenge missions, and features a campaign tasking you with patrolling the seas for prey. The water effects are my favorite part in all honesty, the rest is simply 'there'. If you're looking for an in-depth submarine simulator, this is not it. If you're just looking to spend a few minutes torpedoing ships out of the water, then give this a look. I'm giving it a positive recommend because it's very similar to 'SS2' and it's more convenient to play this than to bring my NES out of mothballs.

            "review_text": "It is an arcadey submarine game with hints of simmulation...well, a sprinkling. In light of so many games that take themselves so seriously, this one is a good balance to me. I find it a lot like Pringles...you know it's not real chips but dang it they're enjoyable...just one more! For price vs quality its a good deal, I reccomend this as a fun time killer, you will try again to see how much you can do in the limited 'fuel tim' you have. And watch that periscope...it'll get you in trouble!",
