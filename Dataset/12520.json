            "review_text": "If, like me, you are too impatient to wait for American Truck Simulator to be finished then this game is the best when it comes to driving trucks across the United States from coast to coast.   It is by no means a perfect game but it is one of the best in the 18 Wheels of Steel series. The series includes seven games, but only three of them are on Steam. Most fans prefer the previous ' 18 Wheels of Steel: Haulin' ', but I think that's only because the modding community was more active for that one. Unless you absolutely need replicas of popular trucks then I think it's okay to do without them. Other than that, both games are nearly identical to each other. The only major difference is that American Long Haul has more cities to explore. Not only is the mainland United States traversible (not Hawaii and Alaska), but you can also visit parts of Canada and Mexico. I think that alone makes American Long Haul worth playing over any other trucking simulator.  Like I said, the map is huge; covers all of the country with most major cities being represented. The ony downside to this is that there is no route advisor. A world map and a mini-map on the screen are the only tools that can help you get get around. It's kind of annoying at first having to go back and forth to the map to familiarize yourself with the roads. But then I started liking the challenge because it reminds me of the old days before GPS was available and drivers actually had to use road maps.  One thing I really like about this game and which I think is sorely needed today is the CB radio feature. During your travels you can hear other drivers on the radio asking for weather and traffic reports and you can actually respond to them with a response menu by pressing the 'v' key. It doesn't appear to do anything at first except give you a warm feeling inside, but apparently it helps your reputation grow and opens up more drivers for hire later on.  There's no option for using internet radio like you can in other SCS games, but you can import your own music. In that case you must convert your MP3s to the OGG format and there are websites you can use for doing that without downloading anything. I imported a few radio stations from GTA and they sound very nice and natural in this game.  My biggest gripe would have to be the steering. There is a mod somewhere that lets you steer with a mouse, but I prefer using a keyboard for steering. It works for me in other driving games, and until I actually buy a steering wheel that is what I'm going to use. Unfortunately, in this game, the wheel auto-centers itself too quickly so you're having to constantly jam on the 'a' and 'd' keys when making a sharp turn. It's not a total inconvenience, but it takes some time to get used to. If it bothers you that much then I would suggest a controller.  Hard to believe that SCS made this game so many years ago and there's actually more ground to cover than in any of their recent games. American Truck Simulator was released with only two states and Euro Truck Simulator 2 is being finished by modders. But they have stuck with the same formula over the years and, aside from graphics, their games have remained the same.  American Long Haul is not much different from ETS 2 or American Truck Simulator. You're still a truck driver managing your own company; you take jobs and deliver loads; you hire drivers to work for you; when you get tired you pull off the side of the road and sleep; when you need gas you go to the filling station; police give you a hard time; and when you get money you can buy more trucks. And really, what else do you need? Why not just skip the DLC fest and play this game instead?",

Years ago I loved playing this game, but Euro Truck Simulator 2 basically ruined this game for me... If you want a alturnitive to ETS2 this is a okay one (much better than extream truckers IMO too). but if your looking for a really good truck sim, jump to Euro Truck Simulator 2 instead.  Also the people making Euro truck simulator 2 are making a America version too, so that should be fun. ;)  PS I just realized ETS2 and This are made by the same Developer.  Anyway I'm going to go with No, wait for the America Truck simulator (my name for it :P) or get Euro Truck simulator, it's better than this game, even though this game isn't really bad. Plus youre atleast helping the same Developers. :)",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Fun for a few hours, car AI sucks, cops are unfair, driving is okay, hauls take too long, slow to make money, some very fun opportunites to jump your truck.   Its fun, but i wouldn't recommend it. The driving mechanics are okay, its annoying that there is no completely player controlled shifting mode. Turn signals don't do ♥♥♥♥, but emergency lights will make anyone near you slam on their brakes, which can be alot of fun on a boring long haul. There is a decent amount of road in this game, enough that long hauls take a very long time. It is too easy to damage the trailer, and it is also WAY too easy to run red lights. Effective braking can be accomplished by using the pedal brakes (S), the jake brake (B), and the parking brake (Space). Cars will honk at you for waiting patiently behind other cars at red lights. Cars will also make sudden turns in the wrong lanes that will ♥♥♥♥ you up. Cars will also turn right into your trailer without realizing that it is there until too late. Cops are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and can ticket you without even chasing you. If you pass by a cop on your side of the divided highway, they will ticket you, if you pass a cop on the other side of the road, they will pursue you, It is surprisingly easy to outrun the cops, but if you don't have some speed built up before you start the chase, you are screwed. Also, it helps to have some heavy traffic when in a police chase, the cops aren't the best at avoiding crashes. The sleeping mechanic in this game is annoying, without checking your driving logs you really have no idea when you are getting sleepy. There are also some glitchy spots where you can fall out of the map, as well as some AWESOME jump opportunities.    It would take a very long time to make decent money by delivering cargo, so instead i found an alternative method. Buy CHEAP used trucks, i think trucks under $50,000 are ideal, then fix them up and sell them. This way allows you to make money very easily. Don't buy expensive trucks and try to do this, the profit dissapears quickly as the price increases.",

Cons: Some of the world limits aren't visible so sometimes you bounce off invisible barriers. If you purchase the oversized load trailer and try to take it, it freezes the game. I even tried reinstalling and got the same issue. It needs a tutorial. I had to wait until I got fined to figure out what I was doing which means save regularly because some of the fines can break you off the bat. It's hard to tell what you need to do to be able to hire new employees which btw can be found at hotels. Not sure if it's by the number of contracts or garages or completed shipments.  Pros: It's quite similar to starting a company. You can take loans, buy better equipment, add accessories, hire employees. It's open world so you can just drive around or choose which company you want to ship for. All in all I'd give it a solid 4/5. Enjoy!",
