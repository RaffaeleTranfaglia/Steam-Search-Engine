            "review_text": "ok so this game is really grindy af.. it gets to the point where you just put it on auto and can sleep through the night (unless some tough guy pk's you) which i warn you, if you wanna play this game certain people in toue kingdom might kill you even if you're in the same kingdom! which makes no sense there are 3 different kingdoms and the 3rd one you cant get transferred to until you reach lvl 35 i believe and then again its prob not worth it to transfer there, anyways. for a lot of the content (that helps you level up exponentially) you're gunna need a group and if you wanna relax its gotta be balanced and so forth basic ♥♥♥♥ right. NO! cuz i swear every damn mofo in the server plays as either an archer or assassin. rarely will you see a friar (or a decent one) or a tank. in my experience anyways (ign :reaper529 guild: Fury if you're interested in joining we just levelled the guild so pm me we got spots for anyone in kingdom of magic) If anyone else has been having major server issues on and off please let me know too (also if you're just starting for someone that has referred put in my email:  kevinknoblock2@gmail.com)  i think it asks for email for referral lol",

            "review_text": "Ive played tons of different mmorpgs over the years and for a f2p mmorpg this game is pretty decent. Graphics are fine, combat and general movement is fluent and impactful, leveling isnt annoying, game is optimized and takes up very little resources, great ping and no disconnects or crashes on release day (now thats rare), a lot of classes (some standard classes like mage, archer, assassin but also some unique classes) and there seems to be a lot of content too. Daily Events, some sort of rebirth system, 7 crafting skills, tons of quests etc...  The only negative things so far is the limited character customization (you cant even zoom in to the face) and not being able to jump.  If youre bored with everything thats out right now (like me) and youre looking for something that doesnt annoy you and holds you over til something new comes out, you will probably like this.",
