If you're a fan of the Sierra type of point and click adventure games (Kings Quest, Police Quest, Liesure Suit Larry, etc) this one will not disappoint. I suggest reading the manual before just diving in. This was made back when games were hard and people loved them, so dont get too frustrated with it.",
