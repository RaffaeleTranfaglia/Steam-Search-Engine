While not terrible by any means, the game is obviously inferior to its earlier counterparts in numerous ways, and the PC port's various issues - including completely locked 30fps and random crashing, often from alt-tabbing - make for a lackluster experience. The latter can also become particularly infuriating with the game's fairly sporadic save system.",

            "review_text": "Just another buggy piece of junk.   Once I got through the usual black screen startup inherent to a lot of rushed PC games, I had to figure out why the game was running on such a low (often stuttering) framerate on my usually quite decent hardware (core i5 + gtx 770), but after tinkering few minutes with some settings in the config files and trying to overload vsync in nvidia control panel (turning it off gave me terrible screen tearing, which was a pretty bad sign considering my hardware and the game graphics), I got to the conclusion that the game was just performing the best it could and that its coding was just a mess... of course this was confirmed when I encountered ridiculous 5/10 seconds freezes after some cutscenes. The whole thing was starting to make me quite uneasy as save points in this game are set way too far appart, but more on that soon!  Anyway, despite the terrible performance, I still wanted to give it a shot, as I'm a big amateur of the Silent Hill series and actually owned the same game on X360, but never got much far due to the utter annoyance of the combat system in hard difficulty and one awful freeze that made me lost one hour of boring gameplay. But this time I was determined to go through with it, thinking a pretty average game with Akira Yamaoka's music might at least give me a bit of pleasure.  So there i was, wasting another time tediously running around on some cheap scavenger hunt from corridor to corridor in what appears to be an even more cheap knock off of a Silent Hill game, which quickly throws a bunch of cliches from Silent Hill 2 at you without even trying to have its own identity. It's really quite impressive how bad Double Helix was at this, but hardly surprising if you look at their other games or even at the ones from their former companies (nothing really good appart from a bunch of games in the 90's). How they got this gig is mind-boggling and just shows how Konami execs have become out of touch this last decade to the point of trusting these hacks with one of their most emblematic franchise. It's kind of sad from a company that most definitely was at the top of its game from the 8bit to the PS2 era (one of my best gaming memories as a kid where on their SNES games. still remember how seeing their logo screen popping up would instantly reassure me that I was in for some quality gaming time).  But I disgress... Remember what I said about those save points being way too far appart for a buggy game like this? Right after the first level of the game, you get into a really tedious part of the game, which pretty much consists of running around way too much in different parts of the town. I only had one save point in the beginning, but then I got to almost fully explore a house, picked up quite a bunch of stuff, got to explore the first part of a cemetery only to have to backtrack quite far, because I didn't see the right climbing path the first time around. And then, just before I finally got to the next save point, BAM! got accidentely ALT-TABed out of the game, which of course crashed when I tried to get back in it! Almost made me smile... Almost :p. Anyway, I was just looking for a good reason to put this game down early (and forever. this time) and it looks like it made me a favor by collapsing from the weight of its own mediocrity after a mere 1 hour of gameplay.  So there you have it. Think twice before buying this terrible port. Even if you actually remotely enjoyed it on consoles, you're probably going to have a bad time. Besides, there are so much better games like this one to try (hell, even a small indie game like Lone Survivor gets it more). In the meanwhile Konami might pull their head out of their ♥♥♥♥ and redeem themselves by releasing the 4 earliest Silent Hill games on Steam. Hopefully it'll happen before they cut their veins open, while ingesting pachinko balls and frenetically playing DDR until they die while trying to figure out how they can 'revive' another franchise. Yeah... this must how they've been making their decisions lately.",

And if the resolution is set higher than 1080p the inventory window only displays 1/4 of itself. If I play at 1920x1080 it seem to run ok on Win10 (with crashes here and there). The game also tends to freeze for 10 seconds here and there; just be patient until it resumes. So yeah, if you don't mind all that, the game's story is pretty descent. On second thought, maybe I should just delete it and go play RE. LOL, nah!",

For the first 2 hours i was waiting for something to go wrong, now close to 4 hours I'm confident that a majority of the reviews arent quite the truth. I have a 2014 dell with a family graphics card, the only time this game crashed is when i tried to get back to my checkpoint because i didnt learn the combat yet, which to be honest i deserved to crash. Nothing else since then, there are rare moments when the game stutters but its only temporary. The combat is a bit strange at first but once you get the jist of using shift to enter combat mode its an instant breeze everything else is rudementery, you mainly use the mouse and the space bar aside some inventory but its all clearly laid out. Mouse 0 means M1 and mouse 1 means M2 thats all. The game itself is spectacular i havent felt this kind of fear in a long time, the fear of the unknown you start out knowing almost nothing. That is the beauty of this series, takes me back to times when i played Silent hill 2 on the old Playstation 2. All this to say, not that everyone has the same situation this game is amazing, if you see it on sale its worth the shot. Don't instantly belive all the negativity if your a patient person and love engaging games then give it a go. If it doesnt work its almost more easier to refund than it is to purchaching it, so dont feel afraid. Haha unless your playing! That is all : )",

It's an awful port, for example: the audio doesn't work on any chipset that I've ever tried it on. I've installed this game on several machines (mine and my friends') and it doesn't produce sound properly on any of them. I've tried playing it with various integrated, crappy and very common chipsets as well as several Creative Labs and ASUS PCI-E products. None of them work with the game properly; it's astounding. There are other things to pick at, surely, but this is what bothered me the most ...especially since the game heavily relies on sound to create atmosphere and suspense, etcetera. The game itself may or may not sate the desire of a Silent Hill fan's want of a Silent Hill experience. It borrows a few bits from the film and is sort of reminiscent of the visual aesthetics of it's predecessors along with some creative new elements and it's own story-line. Anyhow, if you decide to buy it, good luck!",
