Grind  But it is entertaining nonetheless.  It's hard to be critical about a game that is at todays date $1.99 USD, that doesn't crash or suck memory. Some big name titles do that for $59.99 USD.  So if you like mindless killing over, and over and over again - get it If not - avoid.  OH, and it has achievements, essentially the main I reason I purchased it. It looks like a 100%er if you are prepared to grind.  8/10 ",
