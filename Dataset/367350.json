            "review_text": "Demon Hearts-- it's a fast paced precision platformer, that wears its inspirations on its sleeves, it takes all the best lesons learned from platformers of recent years and jam packs them into 50ish levels. The controls are simple and the gameplay is deep without being too complex.   There is no doubt that you should pick this hidden gem up, as it's only $10, especially if you're a fan of games like, Super Meat Boy, I wanna be the Guy, Wings of Vi, etc.",

I Wanna Be the Guy is still free and has far more character than this game.",
