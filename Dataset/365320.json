The focus is on building atmosphere and setting, and not constant battles or twitchy gameplay.   + Solid voice acting (characters seemed believable) + Unique gameplay focused on exploration and ambience + Consistent foreboding atmosphere + Non cliche &amp; mysterious story keeps me intrigued  - Animations can be clunky - Textures repeat a little more often than I would like and it's hard to tell some areas apart  I haven't played through the entire campaign yet, and I'll update this review if my opinion changes.
