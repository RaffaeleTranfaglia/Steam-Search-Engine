            "review_text": "Let's start this recommendation with a bit of background information about my history with Assassin's Creed. It's important, yes, yes it is.   I loved Assassin's Creed, ever since the first game, the one where you play as the weird monkey, I mean monk, Altair. You climb from building to building, start beating up people, stabbing them, jumping around, the bread and butter formula of Assassin's Creed.   Assassin's Creed 2 took this system to a whole new level, with the introduction of Ezio, whom in my opinion, is still the best character in the entire series. Then came Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Liberation, etc etc, it's all the same formula with slightly different changes per game. For instance, the Twin Blades in AC2, the Hookblade in Revelations, and the usage of recruits in Brotherhood.  The series, was awesome.  HOWEVER, the Assassin's Creed did get plagued by several things, but mainly, Uplay, or as I'd like to call it, U-♥♥♥♥♥-play. It's horrible, AC2 was 'DRM-ed' with having a constant connection to the servers, only problem being was that the servers happily cut off connection every 10 seconds, causing you to get booted from AC2.   ANYWAY. After that massive screw over by Ubisoft with Unity, I decided to boycott the entire series. Microtransactions? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performances even on my GTX970? Yeah, I was done with the AC series. Till Syndicate had a 40% sale, and I figured, hey let's give this game another chance!   And I'm glad I did, for the first few hours anyway.  Let's talk about Graphics. It's amazing, it's beautiful, and London is one huge city to explore. Most importantly, it runs on Ultra settings with my 970, something Unity failed to do even with 4x Titan Xs. Yeah, the optimization for this game is nicely done (after two weeks anyway).  Now moving on to Gameplay.. It's typical Assassin's Creed, you jump, you fly, you go left and right, you stab people. Except now, they make you choose between a stealth character or a brawling character. Some like the AC combat system, I personal prefer the stealth elements. Both characters share the same EXP pool, so you can switch between them as and when you like.  By the way, controls are dumb-ed down, you just hold one button to fly across the map. There's no elements such as near fall, or any other more complicated buttons to press for that matter. It's literally a babi-ed Assassin's Creed, there's no more complexity that the older games delivered.   How about the story? It's, once again, a typical Assassin's Creed story. Assassin's trying to over throw Templars. It's been the same thing since the first game. Although I do hate the inturruptions between the real world and the London world, YES THAT ANNOYING MID SEQUENCE THING IS STILL THERE. Why didn't they bring back the Black Flag system beats me, it worked.  Audio?  The music is medicore at most, upon launching most AC games, you'll instantly get drawn to the menu music. Personally, I felt that Syndicate's music is a lot weaker compared to the other AC games. AC1's Credits Song, AC2's Venice Rooftops, AC:B Master Assassin and even AC3's Main Theme, all of these had a lasting impact on the player because of the nature of the piece. Sadly, Syndicate's music doesn't deliver that tier, the music is good, but it won't stick with you.  Multiplayer? First Unity removed the AMAZING multiplayer experience started by Brotherhood. Gone were the days where you tried to assassinate another Assassin while at the same time, running away from your own Assassin / Templar.  They threw in Co-Op instead  Then Syndicate removed Co-Op.  Yep. What Multiplayer?  What about the microtransactions in this game?  Fk off Ubisoft.   This is a slight Yes to recommending this game since it IS Assassin's Creed, and it IS fun for a while (at least).   Pros - Not Unity  - It's a DECENT Assassin's Creed  - The story is alright - Game is really, really well optimized - It's Not Unity - Did I mention it's not Unity?  Cons - Micro-♥♥♥♥♥-transactions - Dumb-ed down controls - Medicore Soundtrack - No Multiplayer  - Did I mention Micro-♥♥♥♥♥ transactions?",

            "review_text": "Assassin's Creed has, until now, been something I appreciated more in concept than in execution. Syndicate is the first in the series I have actually, legitimately enjoyed in almost all regards. Part of this is due to a bit of personal bias - Victorian London has always been a favorite setting of mine and it's here in beautiful, meticulously detailed glory. But aside from that, the actual gameplay is improved, specifically with stealth and traversal. Botching a stealth kill doesn't automatically alert everyone and their mother within a 20 mile radius, and the zipline lets you avoid having to ponderously pick your way up every single building facade if you don't want to. Furthermore, each sidequest can be completed through a number of different methods, and there's not an overwhelming amount of stupid collectibles. And while the story itself is merely okay, the characters you meet and play as are all pretty charming and even legit funny. Syndcicate seems to be all about removing all the series' barriers between you and fun, and it's definitely working for me.",

Ubisoft came back to reality and to the roots of their most famous last generation videogame saga with this title, REMOVING MULTIPLAYER / CO-OP, giving us a thrilling plot set in the Victorian London near the end of 1800, two charismatic characters that are twins and both of them gave me the same feeling I felt when I was playing as Ezio Auditore the first time.  I recommend this game to every fan who still believes there's hope for the Assassin's Creed saga, cause the first stepping stone for Ubisoft for their redemption is this game, Assassin's Creed Syndicate.",

            "review_text": "If you're using NVidia be sure to turn off MFAA in the NVidia Control Panel if you use it AND be on Driver Version 359.00! Without doing those two things you may run into issues that myself and others have ran into which range from buildings not appearing, graphical glitches everywhere, some textures looking like it's straight up Missingno from Pokemon. However with the drivers + no MFAA the game runs flawlessly!  I guess since this is a review I should also add in my general early thoughts (2 hours in). The game itself feels like a step forward in terms of art design and the way it handles side quests. Opening up a map doesn't seem overwhelming anymore. You just have 5 or 6 clear objectives in every section of the map. It's not 1000+ little collectibles marked all over. The pacing is on point. The story is also quite good so far, I especially love the skill tree added in. Gameplay wise it seems to be a step back. Unity went for a more open ended mission structure (Syndicate could still go this way considering how early into the game I'm in) where you were given a target and a general location and all you had to do was figure out a way to kill the target. This one seems to lead you down a direct path to your targets leaving little creativity to how you dispose of targets (So AC1-4 style). It also feels like the combat is a step back. It's a counter fest again. So if you're down with the old gameplay style for another entry then it's fine. However, if you really enjoyed Unity's approach to mission structure and combat then you may feel a bit disappointed.",

            "review_text": "The story is empty and hollow. The story that normally takes place in the 'real world', as in out of the animus, is entirely cut scenes and uncontrollable. The fighint in game can be won by smashing the X button alternating with A. And there is absolutly no benefit to stealth. Infact you never need to blend into crowds anymore. It's honestly difficult to blend in, the mechanic doesnt work well.   Everything in the story is predictable and boring and you play two characters who are as deep as paper.   The typical assassins creed glitches are infuriating.  The home base, which you normally build up, is automatically updated and renovated after some missions. Pointless.  Everyone seems to think this game is good, but they keep saying that it's better than unity. This game may not be broken like unity but the story is crap, the characters are crap, and the world is crap.   Maybe there will be a Shamamamamlama twist at the end, but that wouldnt redeem the pointless nature of the whole game.   I'm going to beat it, because I am close. But I wish I didn't buy it. Not worth it.  No puzzles of any difficulty, no stealth of any difficulty, no combat of any difficulty. The whole game is played by heading to brightly colored HUD icons, zipping around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ batman, and beating any and every combat scenario by smashing a button to see one of a handful of highly repetitive kill sequences.   This game sucks",

            "review_text": "Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a historical action-adventure open world stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft. Set within London in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution, the story follows twins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate the corridors of organized crime during the Victorian era and fight against the established order, controlled by the Templars. The game retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as introducing new traveling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics.   Unlike its direct predecessors but like the first two main games in the series, Syndicate does not feature any multiplayer gameplay. Assassin's Creed Syndicate marks the first time in the series where you can freely switch between two different protagonists. It is also the first main entry in the series to feature a playable female protagonist. Male lead Jacob Frye is meant to be more of a hot-headed brawler, specialized in close combat, while his twin sister Evie is strong in stealth and relies on her intelligence and wit.   The Assassins' main weapons this time around include brass knuckles, a compact revolver, a cane sword and the traditional Nepalese curved kukri knife and combat is faster-paced than before. Additionally new travelling systems make their debut in the game, such as a rope launcher which allows the you to rappel up structures as well as create a zip-line between buildings, and carriages, which can all be piloted or simply occupied by you, and trains. London in the game is approximately 30% larger than Paris in Unity and consist of seven boroughs: Westminster, the Strand, the City of London, Whitechapel, the Thames, Southwark and Lambeth.   Overall I think Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a massive improvement and perhaps the best AC game since AC II not just because of the gameplay and the story, but also the port. It runs very smoothly and the graphics are just beautiful, I suggest you play around with the settings to get the best performance possible. It hardly has any game breaking bugs or glitches that can prevent you from being able to complete certain missions. If your getting an AC game I suggest you go for this as it will absolutely blow you away without a single doubt at all!.",

I have a GTX 970, with an i7 4790 and run it at 1080p 60fps no problem with high settings and hbao+ enabled. My only real gripe with this game is the so-called 'new dynamic combat system.' I see it as a step back actually from Unity. It's really dumbed down imo and not challenging at all. Unitys combat was better and a lot more challenging; something I wanted in the franchise but then they take it away. Still love the game but looking forward to 2017's installment. I'm hoping for more challenging combat.",

            "review_text": " TL;DR: Crash to Desktop: The Game.   I'll begin by stating I am not an ardent fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise.  My first intallment in the franchise was Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. Some will say that this was a highlight in the storied gaming series, and it certainly felt entertaining and refreshing for its time. Since playing and completing Brotherhood, I've longed to play another Assassin's Creed game despite varied successes.  I contemplated purchasing Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, but decided against it purely in opposition to its selling point: its naval exploration and combat focal points. I wanted a return to the exciting combat and incredible settings that Brotherhood (and many subsequent games) have aspired for.  That was my first mistake.  I had also wanted to give Assassin's Creed: Unity a chance... but decided against it due to overwhelmingly negative peer review. Still, the idea of a co-operative Assassin's Creed game is promising.  I decided that I had waited long enough. I had heard that Assassin's Creed: Syndicate attempts to capture what made Brotherhood so great. (You might even argue that Jacob Frye is emulating Ezio Auditore a little too much.)  That was my second mistake.  I went ahead and purchased the gold edition for the game with having put a little time and research into the product. I came in with relatively low expectations due to repeated failures in Ubisoft's past, but was pleasantly surprised by the prologue. Jacob and Evie Frye are fascinating characters and genuinely enjoyable to play for the most part.  However, this is not only an Ubisoft game, it's an Assassin's Creed game. What bugs and glitches I experienced at first were minor, at best, until the big one came. My hardware should have little trouble running this game on decent settings, yet despite that, I reached the infamous 'Stage 3' train scene and fight.  This stage is known to cause immediate crashing, to which it has done to me aplenty. I cannot pass it, and in some cases, cannot even load to the main menu as a consequence of where my progress stopped.  Now, I dislike the idea of 'thumbs down'ing a game due to a performance issue I cannot resolve on my part... However, in this case, I make an exception. It is an issue many have experienced and Ubisoft has not yet addressed with patching. Until this problem is resolved, I  cannot  -- in good faith -- recommend this game to my friends or the general public.  Alas... I had looked so forward to it.",

In this series of games there were some aspects that I valued most of all, especialy in the first four games. From then on i felt the magic of AC had been lost. AC Syndicate became for me a fresh start for this saga, returning most of our beloved AC defining characteristics, such as: immersive story and interesting characters, stealth and fight mechanincs and that feeling that you belong to the historical setting the story takes place.  All in all, as a fan of the first AC games, i believe this game is a must for those wishing for the good old AC days. It's not a perfect game, but it is different in a smart and new kind of way. I'd give it 4 stars, in five.",

All in all I think it is the best assassin's creed game money can buy. The charles dickens side missione are very interesting and go into the 'spirit world' of things as was believed at that time.",

            "review_text": "Syndicate runs well for a Ubisoft game, UPlay has been updated and redefined so now it's much more like using origin, it's less clunky and frustrating to play a Ubisoft game on PC now, well for me at least.   The gameplay feels like a tradional AC game with the addition of a grappling hook so you can quickly make it from point A to point B. The melee combat is much faster paced and the takedowns are incredibly over the top, I bashed a guy in the head with a cane and he did a full flip and then I hit him again to kill him, they're cool looking none the less but it's a little too over the top at times.   Jacob and Evie are probably my all time favorite protagonist's out of all AC games, I played Rogue and I felt that Shay was an amazing character to play as but running around as Jacob or Evie is much more enjoyable this time around.   The customization is nicely done, they still offer micro transactions like they did in Unity but it feels much less forced now, I've been able to quickly get the equipment I want by just playing the game the way I want to, I don't feel forced to buy a package of in game money so I can upgrade my weapon. So that's good!  One thing that bothers me is the lack of inventory and equipment, you're only able to equip your weapon in full combat as well as the hidden blade which really bothers me, the whole point of the cane sword is to have a weapon concealed in an average cane but you don't even get to see it! You fight someone and then you take the cane out of your coat pocket and then put it back in after the fight is over, I would like to be able to walk around with the cane hanging out in my hands like in the screenshots but nope. Maybe they'll fix it in an update.   All in all Syndicate is great, it runs well, it's gameplay is great, London is incredibly fun to be in, the characters are well rounded and have a good sense of humour, and the addition of being able to walk around the city with a gang following you is very cool, feels much like Peaky Blinders the game (Great show if you haven't watched it already!)

I got into AC recently starting with Black Flag and then the Ezio Trilogy and the movement is flows really well. Some vets may not like it but you use more buttons now for the free running as opposed to Black Flag/Rogue where you use only 1 button to free run. This uses 2 for the free running whether you want to go up or down so you should have more control on your movement. The story is not the greatest since it's relatively safe so it's not the greatest story in the world but it makes up for it with some of my favorite main chartacters in an AC since Edward Kenway and Ezio Auditore. Jacob and Evie Frye are an awesome brother and sister duo with Jacob being the less serious brother who prefers loud and proud and building up a gang and Evie being more serious with the Assassin and Templar business and prefers being stealthy and healthy. Jacob and Evie are incredibly likable and the 2 together in cutscenes I always have a chuckle with Jacob's sarcasm and not giving a crap about Templar stuff and Evie trying to be serious and get him to get it together. This is a very light hearted AC not as serious as previous titles so I like the change in direction the story takes. Not to mention. London looks beautiful in this game, The PC Version runs really good on my PC as well, so it's very well optimized. I would definitely reccommend Assassin's Creed Syndicate if Unity gave you a bad taste or if you haven't played an AC game in a long time.",

You win some, you lose some.  The game brings a lot of quality of life perks to the Creed franchise that have kinda been around but not excessively. Restocking tools has been a thing since the first game, however weapon variety dwindled for a while until games pretty much had you just use one thing consistently and nothing else. This gives you a little variety, and some enemies are actually more complicated than counter counter counter finish. Not all. Some. Travel options like the ascending grappling hook lets you scale tall buildings rapidly, as well as traverse peaks of rooftops as it doubles as a deployable zipline. Its STUPID useful. Basically, if you have buildings, your Spidey Sense + grappling hook lets you set up the kill however you need to. Having a roaming base is also nice, and it generates revenue for you (with a cap) while you are in game and not in a menu. Slightly annoying, not 'immersion' breaking. Some of the missions are interesting and require a different take on traditional Creed nonsense... but they do get repetitive. I love the fight club missions. Nothing like some old London underground ring fighting where you hear noses crack and jaws break. Gross, but kinda fun.  Pros -Its an Assassin's Creed game. Its just like all the others and while it brings some quality of life improvements, the story is blah and the gameplay is almost identical to every other Assassin's Creed game. If you enjoy all of those, you will probably enjoy this. -Evie is a badass.  Cons -Its an Assassin's Creed game. Its just like all the others and while it brings some quality of life improvements, the story is blah and the gameplay is almost identical to every other Assassin's Creed game.

Likewise the storyline is not predictable, it manages to incorporate the values of any AC game but at the same time provide a refreshing twist to the tales of the AC series. What I disliked about this soon-to-be-classic game is just the similarities such as the hay bales dives and hard to access menu screen, which is understandable as the creators would still want the game to fit in and match up with the rest of the AC series. Would I recommend this game to someone? Yes I would, if you are on the edge, I would say it is a worthwhile purchase. Will I ever compete this game to 100%? Probably someday, we'll have to see. Haha.

It looks great.  - Karl Marx is hilariously represented here as some kind of liberal democrat. I loved those side missions despite the ridiculous historical inaccuracy. Hardly a complaint, though, because no serious person learns about history from video games.  Cons: - It's way too easy. One of the few times I died was when Jacob hit a tree and fell off his zipline. I was hoping for some proper battles in the gang wars, but I finished most of them in less than 30 seconds, usually without even getting hit. It is particularly easy when playing as Evie; most of the enemies died after one or two throwing knives. Maybe I levelled up the characters and the Rooks too fast? I doubt it, because the gang battles with recommended levels of 9/10 were just as easy.   The fight with Starrick is also too easy, for a final boss fight. It took me longer to catch the Spring Heeled Jack in the Charles Darwin side missions than it did to beat Starrick.  Overall, I like it, enough that I'll buy the Jack the Ripper DLC soon to squeeze a bit more out of it.",

The game itself runs fine: I get around 40 - 60 FPS in the open world (with no stuttering) on the high preset on an R9 280X, which is decent (could be better mind you, but I've played worse). There are some drawbacks, however: graphics settings are pretty limited (e.g. no anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing is limited to nasty FXAA and MSAA combinations, can't turn off any of the post-process stuff), special/Gameworks graphics settings are nearly broken on Radeon (and apparently some Nvidia) cards and some cloth physics are limited to 30 FPS, which sounds anal as hell but you'll know exactly what I mean when you play it. But, overall, this is a solid port.",

            "review_text": "tldr at bottom....  While I am recommending this game I have a few things I'd like to say to the developers. I strongly doubt they are reading steam reviews, nor would they care. But hey who knows.  First off, gorgeous game you have made here. The graphics are really REALLY nice on my pc. It's also pretty well optimized. Good work.  Like with all AC titles I've played (most on console) This game had a great story, interesting and funny characters, some new mechanics and gear. It is a good game, and IMO is better than Unity.  With all that being said, this game is clunky. Movements are not subtle or responsive. There are many areas where you should be able to climb/drop/zip, however, evie and jakob will always seem to find one of these spots and become motionless and unresponsive for long enough to be shot or seen. This is a problem. You really need to test these games more before you put them out. It's not fair to your customers to pay 60 dollars to fight through these bugs. Yeah you usually get them in the updates, but that's not what I pay for. I want a finished, professional, glitch free game when I shell out 60 dollars.   In the same subject, while ALL of the animation is beautiful, some of it is not needed. Some of it is actually detrimental to the gameplay. Jakob can jump 300 feet off of a tower into a pile of leaves, yet it takes almost a second to climb a 4 foot chimmney; Something he should be able to hop onto in one brisk movement. Hell I can almost do that in real life and from my time played you can see im not what you would call 'physically active'.   Lastly, I think you guys need to do something really special for your next AC game. Since Black Flag, I think you have sort of... half ♥♥♥♥♥, your last few titles. I don't mean it as an insult because the last few games have been good games overall. You just set the bar way too high when you made ACBF. The last few games have been good, but I think we may be ready for something new. the victorian/revolutionary periods ARE interesting, but a tad bland at times. Give us a full game set in China maybe. Or how about WW2??? What can you guys imagine up for a WW2 title? Templars infiltrate the NAZIS and you get to hunt them all down, flying and driving aspects, maybe para-assassins? The assassin base could be a captured Uboat that you can cruise to all kinds of environments like in black flag! How many copies of that do you think would sell?? A crap ton that's how many. No game will touch you. Make a full co op campaign and you will sell even more.   7/10 buy it, you will enjoy it, just be prepared to scream at your computer a few dozen times.",

The last mission alternates between tasks for the pair of them. i liked this. - the side missions actually have more dept.  - you can customize more of your characters then in the previous ACs - there is no more naval combat (dont get me wrong i think the naval combat is really cool but it never developed beyond 'avoid being blasted by them and then blast them yourself' which is relatively shallow when compairing it to shore combat) - you can collect a number of gadgets during the game that did not appear in previous ACs. my favorite is the zip line which allows you to climb buildings fast.  - this game has no 'present time' interruptions beyond a movie based story. - the in game world looks verry nice. - there is a lot of humor in the stories.   Dislikes: - The loading screen. i dont know why but for some reason your character gets about 30 seconds to run arround in an empty space... this gets boring really fast. why not just load the next map and be done with it? - At the end of each act (for some reason) the game always crashes during saving. i have attempted updating drives/windows and all that nonsense but the issue persists. Checking the forum reveals that i am not the only one haveing crashing issues. This is unaccaptable when a game is newly released but considering the fact that the game was released a while ago makes it even more rediculous. That being said... i just restarted the game and picked up where i left off so the impact of the crashes on my personal gameplay was minimal.  - for some reason i noticed occaisional grapic glitches in the highlighting mechanism which caused by entire screen the filled with bars of light eminating from the thing i was highlighting. This was annoying because i could not see what i was doing.  - mircotransactions... yes they are also present here... allthough i did not use them myself. and my gaming experience did not suffer because of this thankfully - there are two chracters but they basicly have the same skills. Sure the guy (jacob) can carry more bullets then the girl (evie) and evie can carry more knives then jacob but still the differences are rather shallow. This was a disappointment. - there is only one mission in which the characters actually coperate to accomplish a goal. if you have two people they should work together more to accomplish objectives. - for some reason my character sometimes refuses to climb stuff... i find myself mashing spacebar for a couple of seconds and nothing happens. this was really annoying in timed missions. - racing with chariots sounded verry nice but it is not as developed as i hoped it would be. it got annoying really fast. but i just ignored most of the race missions and moved on.   Overall steam asks me: would you recommend this game... and i would say: YES. Allthough i would not pay more then 30 euros for it myself due to the issues i mentioned above (so get in a sale). currently i would rate the game 6/10. 7/10 if they fix the grapics issues and crashes. (which i hope they will)  thanks for reading!",

Doing everything people told me to do. Honestly this is a big FU from ubisoft   I wish there was a 'meh' choice for reviews... However I do feel like I am a tad biased as I just finished playing Black Flag which IMO is the best Assassins Creed game of all time. Even beats 2 for me.   Movement:. What makes and breaks Assassins Creed. Why I liked Assassins Creed so much before is for the easy running that just makes me smile like Black Flag. Making it more complex is even ok more but pressing 3 buttons to jump (certain areas) on my Xbox one controller feels rather tired then fun. The horse riding is pretty fun but nowhere near as fun as the ships in Black Flag   Enviroment: Made me feel like I was in Piccadilly underground again. PTSD of each time I get lost in that line every year I go to London. Which is good... I guess... Not as good as the oceans and islands in Black Flag  Story... very good, if I go into details I will be spoiling... except you meet like every famous British person from that time period within a 1 hour period such as Charles Darwin, Charles Dickins and Florence Nightingale... seems kinda forced and was like 'HEY WE ARE IN ENGLAND BOIS' Surprised we didn't meet the entire cast of Harry Potter and Downtown Abbey within 1 second. Story is not as good as Black Flag.   Also the fighting is rather clunky to say the least. Like I kill the enemy and I just keep on hitting the enemy for like 5 more times. That bothers me a lot because I just wanna move the hell or even move to kill my next enemy. Besides that.. its decent.. I don't like the 'press A' to go into stealth mode either... Maybe just something to get used to. But one thing for SURE I will never like is the overkill combat. Like I kill the enemy in 8 hits but just for pride my character without me wanting to or pressing any buttons hits the enemy about 4 more times. I liked the fighting MUCH better in Black Flag.   Graphics... Hit or miss with me... Looks mostly great on 3440*1440p... everything looks great... but theres the cockroach in the soup. The GOD AWFUL lighting. I mistaken lighting for white paint sometimes and yes I am running this on ultra maxed out. One thing that Syndicate does better then Black Flag    Optimization... Love it Runs smooth 90 frames on 3440*1440p on ultra maxed out besides some small stuff like AA. Granted I have a beast system but much better then the 30 frames people with my same specs used to have :) About as good as Black Flag  Chemistry: Very funny banter. Jacob and Evie have great chesmitry and I did buy the fact that they were twins and have a love hate relationship. The characters were funny... But I liked Ezio and Kenway better. And when they bring up Kenway in the story it felt forced as ♥♥♥♥ again but made me have memories of the old game and how much more fun I had in Black Flag then this game. A game should not make me do that. I guess the bars were WAYYY to high after Black Flag and they could not captitalize on it.    Overall I liked it... I guess... Very very very very hit or miss. I know I bashed the game but despite all that, I had fun. That's what matters and I do not feel bad spending 40 bucks on this game. This game broke my csgo obsession for a bit.

First it crahes in the first bossfight when you cross the Thames, then it crashes on every more or less important mission. It normally crashes in the last part of it, so you have to replay the mission over and over again and hope it will last once.  After all this time the game is released now, there still is no fix for those issues... Not worth the money. For 10 to 15 Bucks I'd recommend it, but not for 60...",

            "review_text": "First things first: I was very sceptical from the beginning, due to the 'modern' setting of a victorian London. The intro and the first two hours of gameplay confirmed my concerns - mild spoilers ahead ---------------&gt; SPOILER BEGINNING exploding and derailed trains? ---------&gt; SPOILER END This is so not Assassin's Creed and its ancient atmosphere it used to be. I felt uncomfortable the first two hours. But I got used to it after a while, and now, I love it. It's like switching from an Amish girlfriend to a wild punkrock brat. It takes time, feels new and loud, but it definitely has its perks. Don't let the setting scare you.   Let's continue with some pros and cons here:  + The rope launcher works like a charm and is hella fun. (You might wanna play story until you get it, it's early and you'll need it for some collectables) + The combat. It feels more fluid again and the time window for counter-attacks is fair +Stealth. The cover system is ehhh.. slighlty improved, corner assassins aren't as buggy as they used to be +Again, stealth. AC Syndicate is more of a stealth game then any AC before. It finally makes sense to be stealthy sneaky beaky like. The connected skill tree provides useful perks and its upgrades now are signifficantly improving your stealth gameplay.  + Performance and Graphics. Even though the details seem to have been slightly decreased(compared to unity), it looks good and offers clean graphics and an improved performance compared to Unity.  + The side missions. They are all connected to your progress and the main story, you don't feel like doing missions that aren't connected to the main goal of the game. The side missions actually make a lot of sense now. 'Hey let's liberate London, but before that, imma do 25 hours of weird activites that aren't connected to anything of my main task' This statement now is wrong and I salute you Ubisoft, thanks for that.  +Funny. Yes, Jacob and his sister are actually funny. +Switching characters. I like that we now can switch between two Assassin's. This seems to have future.  +Parkour. It's fluid and fun, and the rope launcher adds even more fun, provides new opportunities for assassinations and ambushes. Well done Ubi.  +Whistling. Yes, it's back. Either Arno was too dumb to whistle or he simply forgot that he can use his mouth to make noises.  +Overall combat stealth comination. The rope launcher, the interactive environment and your skills offer new tacticts for ambushes and assassinations.    - NO DISPLAYED UNDERGROUND ENTRANCES. Yes. WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR THEM. 'I want that chest underground, but first, let me search all of London for a fricken underground entrance and IF I find one, let's better hope it's the right one, WHAT THE FUDGE UBISOFT, ARE U NUTS???' - No lockpicking. So.. now I have to skill lockpicking for pressing and holding B to open chests? What? Either Lockpicking, or not. Don't half-do it.  - Fewer outfits. Unity had an overwhelming variety of Outfits, Coats and whatever else. Syndicate signifificantly reduced that. You'll have like 8 outfits for each character. You will have to craft them or unlock them via missions. Bad move Ubi, I enjoyed that a lot in AC Unity. Now, you took it away. I spent hours of collecting outfits and feeling pretty wearing them. Bad, bad move.    Okay, I think that's it. I might have forgotten pros and cons, but those were the most important for ME and maybe for YOU. I highly recommend AC Syndicate. Give it a few hours and you'll feel home again.  ",

Negative: - some minor bugs - to much shooting solutions for problems - not so cool story and final ending (in my opinion) - maybe something else - but i dont know much more - not so complex skill system   I am quite happy with the game. You get some humor and can play as female and male assassin. This is great in my opinion, you can play with a character of your choice. Sure you have to solve specific quests with a specific character, but you are allowed to have more control of your favor character. I like the new and fresh idea of driving through the town, explore the inside of a building and have a very unique aproach to a quest. It feels much more like an assassin, to have control of your personal playstyle.  Also i have to admit that shootings become very strange in here. It is often a 'easy' way to solve a complicate situation. But maybe thats just my opinion.  I was not bored by some quest. of course some quest are not easy but i was suprised by making choices (such as taking a hostile) and try things out. You get not punished for doing that so much, what is great imo.  Anyhow, i am sure, if you like AC you will be satisfied by this title.

            "review_text": "Assassin's Creed Syndicate or as I like to call it Saints row in disguise. lets get one thing strate first it's not an Assassin's creed but never the less it's still a good game.  Basics: You play as Jacob and Evie Frye, gang leaders of there new gang thay made on the spot called the rooks much like the rooks from chess &lt;--that was a joke. You can upgrand your rooks buy spending money and crafting materials that you can find, earn or steal. You can upgrand Jacob and Evie with skill points and new weapons and armor ya they added a level up system in the game for better or worse.  GamePlay: The Gameplay is fun you can sneak you can go in load (as load as you acn go with a sword) or you can run people over with a carriage and some how not get dsynchronize. I guess the hours did it??? Any way it's fun.  Performance: Performance sucks you need like tripple or perhaps even more of the speacs to play this game smothly and it gos through ubisoft so that may be way also that means max frame rate of 60pfs because of ubisoft.  Story: It's good lets leave it at that don't wont to spoil it for ya.  Extra: I own this game for the PS4 and I like to play it on there over my pc just saying btw I have a pc that can play day z on ultra but can't play this game I mean come on!!! Not to menchin it took me a bit to figure out why it would not run in the first place forgot what I did but if I remember I'll post it in other words it may not start up for you as well after waiting like 5 hours for it to download so be aware.  So YAY fo console NAA for PC (I'm a pc gamer so don't get me wrong.)",

I just really liked this world, and the characters were fun. Really fun. I liked the sybling rivalries. If you like AC it's not one to skip, if you hate AC it won't change your mind.",

Some of the new mechanics in Syndicate are very interesting and quite fun to mess around with, the zipline in particular. While it does make scaling buildings and getting across rooftops too easy sometimes, in such a large world it is a useful tool nontheless. Syndicate has a larger focus on hand to hand combat than previous installments and I enjoyed this very much. It's a lot more satisfying for me to be able to beat your enemies down with your fists rather than just whipping out a big sword and slicing your enemies like soft butter. Having said that, I did quite enjoy the kukri as a weapon as well. Stealth and parkour mechanics have been improved on since the last installment of Unity, which to be honest I quite enjoyed after the majority of the bugs were fixed. I did enjoy the fact that you could switch between Jacob and Evie, instead of being limited to just one protagonist. Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and I probably will continue to do so, I would highly recommend.",

Jacob and Evie and my two favorite assassins behind Altair. They're fun, they joke with each other, but they're also badass and get things done. This game is probably one of the best AC games yet, and I'm sooo excited to see another. I've been following the series since the first game. I REALLY want to see the next games similar to this one. The graphics ARE SO AMAZING. Unfortunately my computer can't handle ultra graphics, but even on high graphics, I'm blown away.",

The new features of grappling hook and carriage driving seemed a bit gimmicky. However playing more and more each new part fits really well. The best thing for me is having two main characters. OK the play style between the two isn't that marked but it really works. My main problem with 'open world' games normally is that all the side missions take you away from the main story. In syndicate each twin has a story and they intertwine throughout keeping the pace of the narrative high.",

Yes, the freerun down and action button are the same, but I've found they rarely interfer with eachother. Sometimes I'll have to press a button multiple times for it to work but this is rarely an issue and I can easily overlook it in a game this incredible.  BUY THIS GAME.",
