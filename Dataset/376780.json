Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is a sweet system for playing short one-shot murder mystery games but just like The Case of the Mystified Murderess, the case here doesn't do the system justice.

The score system is pretty uncharitable too, but even less so in a case whose 'challenge' is in presenting a lot of apparently valid starting points and asking you to brute-force your way through until you find the thread that, when tugged upon, unravels everything else.",
