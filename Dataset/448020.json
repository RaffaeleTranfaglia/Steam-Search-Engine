There are details placed in the environment that will make you look twice...but the atmosphere is not immersive, the goals make little sense, and it is easy to find yourself wandering in circles, wondering if you missed the content that is supposed to make this game awsome. This is a short, clumsy, lackluster experience with a little quarkyness on the side. You'll spend 14 minutes with dead face, trying to find the windmill, then 25 cumulative seconds saying 'The f*ck just happened?'",
