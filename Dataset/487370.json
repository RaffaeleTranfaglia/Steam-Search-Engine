            "review_text": "  Simple Puzzle game. For me it was the music that made it more enjoyable. It changes up every few puzzles, and you feel inclined to finish a set.   I liked that you can only move to a color that you are changing with....you can get stuck if you pick the wrong color...or turned an object that blocks the path. Easy to retry the puzzle as well.  Played only on Normal...it might be harder on Timed Trials. Well worth, if you want just play a chill relaxing puzzle.  ",
