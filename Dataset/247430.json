            "review_text": "Don't listen to the naysayers, this game is every bit as great as the other Hitman games and should be in your Hitman collection. This is not a spin-off or as some say 'just a remake of Hitman 1'. This is a sequel, this is Hitman 3. It comes after Hitman 2. This is not a remake. Only a few missions are remade from Codename 47, and they are so different that it doesn't matter. The rest of the missions in Hitman: Contracts are original and deserve to be played.  Possibly the darkest and grittiest of the Hitman series. The story follows Agent 47 as he is discovered and shot right after an assignment. Seriously wounded, he staggers into a building and is treated by an old man. The whole game is a series of flashbacks of missions he has had in the past: some never played before, and some we have. Each mission follows a cutscene of 47's present condition. The police finally locate him and surround the building. The end finale is an homage to the finale in Léon: The Professional, and it is incredible.  Some of my favorite missions in the entire Hitman franchise are right here in this game. The Bjarkhov Bomb, The Meat King's Party, Rendezvous in Rotterdam, Beldingford Manor, and Hunter and Hunted are all great missions and they can only be found in this game.   To say that this game is weak or nothing more than a remake of Codename 47 is absurd. I'm here to tell you that this is very much a worthy sequel and a great game that you would be thankful to play.",

            "review_text": "Hitman: Contracts is a game from 2004 and has only just came onto steam after having licensing issues from a band called 'Clutch' because of a music track in the game known as 'Immortal'.  Hitman: Contracts is the 3rd game in the Hitman Franchise and you play as series protagonist; Agent 47. After getting wounded from one of his assignments and collapsing in his apartment room, 47 begins to have flashbacks on previous assasinations he has done. The first mission is what happened directly after the events of Codename 47 and has you escaping from Dr Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's Asylum, where other patients and clones of 47 are located.  While the story isn't something to write home about and even felt a bit underwhelming, it still has a few well made cutscenes and even has a nice twist at the end.  Hitman: Contracts is definatly the darkest Hitman to date, the mentioned well made cutscenes are very grim and the introduction and first level are very disturbing.  Many of the game's levels are based on levels from the first Hitman game: Codename 47 although have been improved and tweaked heavily to create a fresh new experience as well as less frustration. Aside from the first level, every level has atleast one target to kill using a varity of tools and strategies, sometimes you'll have secondary objectives such as finding blackmail photos or something similar. Once you've completed all the necessary objectives, it's time to get out of there using an exit.  The game's stealth controls are well done, such as the stealth kills and sneaking. However the shooting mechanics are a bit underwealming and definatly makes the run-and-gun approach more boring and harder due to the awkward shooting controls, I dare say Hitman 2 had better shooting. Speaking of shooting, there are a varity of guns at your desposal, such as SPAS 12 shotguns, AK74s, MP5s and so on, each well detailed and has a nice reload animation.  When you kill somebody or happen to find a disguise in a level, you can wear the disguise and blend in as the enemy, being able to go inside restricted areas and carry rifles in case things get messy. However if you move too close to NPC you're disguised as, there is a small chance they will realize you don't belong there and will begin opening fire. Think of it as like Absolution's disguise system except without a blending mechanic. However the disguise system isn't perfect, I still felt restricted in exploring many environments with the right disguise with the large chance of being spotted easily and made the game needlessly more difficult.  Speaking of difficulty, many times I was spotted, I never knew why even with a disguise on, I didn't know if I was actually in a restricted area, was doing something wrong, carrying the wrong weapon, which made me extremely frustrated and again made it needlessly difficult.  After completing the game's 12 levels, you can go back and try and earn the 'Silent Assassin' rank, which will net you a new weapon for each level completed with the rank, which definatly increases the replayability if you want a lot out of the game.  Graphically, the game for 2004 was very detailed and was overall beatiful and by today's standards, they definatly look dated but still looked very nice in many areas such as the animations. There are a varity of locations ranging from Manors, Russian snow areas, a Chinese city, Paris and so on and so fourth.  Sound wise it's great, most of the guns sound great, the voice acting is well done, and environment sounds are fantastic. Of course I have to mention the music composed by Jesper Kyd, and holy ♥♥♥♥ does he do a great job at the music. The music is very dark and fitting for Contracts as again it's the darkest game in the series, playing lots of foreboating music pieces and creepy tunes and possibly has one of my favourite main themes.  Overall, Hitman: Contracts is a worthy entry in the Hitman Franchise, the game is very difficult, but also rewarding especially if you manage to get the highest stealth rank; Silent Assassin. If you haven't played Hitman: Contracts before or haven't played it in a very long time, I definatly reccommend picking it up.  Hitman: Contracts is a dark, disturbing game, and that's why I love it.  8/10",

            "review_text": "Oh ♥♥♥♥, son, it's Hitman: Contracts!  The third game in the Hitman series, and the last to be released on Steam (because licensing issues),  Hitman Contracts  takes place between two missions of  Blood Money , the next game in the series.  It doesn't really introduce anything new, but rather builds on what was already there in  Codename 47  and  Silent Assassin ; the controls have been improved, the learning curve is more gentle, and there are a LOT more ways to navigate the levels and dispose of your targets (there are always at least three different ways to kill them).  It focuses more on stealth, meaning run'n'gun, while an absolute blast for a change of pace in  Codename 47  and  Silent Assassin , is not longer a 'viable option'; you can still definitely DO it, but it's harder to do because the enemies act smarter and together to take you down instead of rushing head-first into a stream of bullets.  Four levels from  Codename 47  are remade in this game, something I personally like as I found  Codename 47  the weaker game in the series, but the rest of the levels are new to this game.  Bottom line is, if you like the Hitman games, this is definitely a good game to own, especially for the price you're paying.   Rating: Bald man playing dress-up/10 ",

The problem is that once you experience the rush that agent 47's obstacles provide, you will make mad you grandmother for destringing her piano, whilst anxiously waiting for your own black suit/red tie, straight razor and tattoo gun from eBay.. Hitman: Contracts is a splendid annexation of Codename 47 and Silent Assassin, it will manifest within you the foretaste for the continuing saga of a legendary assassin unbound to death.",

I have played some of this game in the past, but never as serious as I have now. It used to be my least favorite Hitman game, but now that I really got into it, it's probably my favorite.  The game is pretty much all flashbacks to 47's missions in the past, there are some new ones, but about half of them are great remakes of Codename 47's missions.   Pro's:  + Great, dark atmosphere + Amazing soundtrack, it doesn't have many tracks though, you will hear some in multiple levels + Great stealth game + Awesome Codename 47 mission remakes + Challenging. Getting a 'Silent Assassin' rating on a mission is extremely satisfying   Con's:  - The game is pretty short, but because you have to learn the levels a bit, it'll take you some time. - The voice acting is pretty bad, except for the main characters - Gameplay is a bit dated  If you only played Hitman Absolution or Hitman 2016, beware, this game is pretty hard in comparison, it doesn't give you many hints like Hitman 2016 and it's not as linear as Hitman Absolution",

After an assignment gone wrong, he's been wounded and is moments away from being hunted down by a squadron of a French S.W.A.T. team lead by a police official whom 47 was trying to assassinate. As 47 tries to recover from his wounds, he starts to remember his missions from his past including missions when he was first enlisted into the ICA. Once more the graphics are improved a notch and the controls are also given an upgrade making this game more playable than the first two games as there aren't as many flaws as present as I was used to seeing in the previous installments. The FMV sequences are very well animated, you know the development now has the software to create a great game. As in the second game, the weapons obtain in each level are usable once you have beaten the game. Only guns are collectable in the game and not melee weapons like in the last game. There are more weapons to choose from as well as certain weapons only obtainable when achieving a 'Silent Assassin' reward. Making this game highly replayable, you can't go wrong with this almost perfect sequal to everyone's favorite bald anti-hero.",

As much of a fan as I am for the Hitman franchise, I'd recommend just skipping this one and moving on to Blood Money or sticking with Silent Assassin. If you enjoy buggy, Omnipotent AI not only blowing your cover but also tracking your pin-point location from across the map as-well-as an absolutely attrocious disguise system that makes it to were Russians will immediately rule out and open fire on a stranger who's face is completely covered in a parka and goggles but hardly even bat an eye at the clearly bald, beardless gentleman with a barcode on the back of his head simply because he's wearing the same uniform as them... Then feel free to 'enjoy' this game. But as for me, no. I wouldn't recommend it.  To the game's credit however I will say that the graphics are on par or greater than Hitman 2: Silent Assassin. The controls are smooth and reliable, the mouse is a bit floaty which can lead to misclicking but that's no biggie so long as you don't click 'Delete Save File.' Oh, but while we're on that subject I will warn that the game doesn't come with a save file of it's own. DO NOTE that you have to go to your Steam file, go to common, find Hitman: Contracts, and manually create a save file YOURSELF! It is NOT fun AT ALL to spend 2 hours having fun and getting to the 3rd mission, only to take a break and come back to find the game hasn't saved at all! I rest my case.",

I really don't understand why theres haters saying that this isnt a real hitman game when it has all the aspects of a hitman game and possibly a bit more. Although I enjoyed the game, I found it quite short, especially because one of the missions took me less than 5 minutes to complete, and all the remastered missions from the first hitman had at least different ways of doing things that werent in the first hitman, and i'm not entirely sure you can do it the same way as the first game because some of the missions are severely tweeked with the design of the mission. so if you were excited fort the missions to be the same, be prepared for a difference. Also, the only mission i felt that was detrimental to the main story of the series was the first and last missions, just words for thought.  I enjoyed this game and the last two, and i'm excited to play blood money later on, but if you're getting this more so for the story, you might be better off just watching the beginning and end of the game on youtube, but thats just my opinion. If you are getting this for the gameplay, I 100% recomend this game and you will get everything you want out of a hitman game.",
