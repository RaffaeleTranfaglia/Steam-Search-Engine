            "review_text": "Cold War takes nearly every element from 2020 and improves it ten fold. The graphics are still somewhat primitive but improved greatly and it almost has a charm to it. The diplomatic elements are still some of the best in strategy games but still lacks some features that could make it the best. Military wise its fun and easy to figure out and the new Merchant marine makes it ten times easier to move troops globally and invade island nations. The economic part of the game is time consuming but makes you think about what you need to make it work well. The interface for managing everything is organised but can be confusing with some elements hidden behind too many other interfaces making it a maze to figure something simple out. The Cold War campaign is well organised with the Atomic and Space races and the many conflicts and problems are there that were present in the 1950s,60s,70s and 80s. The Sandbox mode is also still fun to play and a healthy mod scene makes it enjoyable to try different modes and scenarios.  Overall this game is definatly worth your time and money if you into this genre.",

Overall not worth the bother to start with.",

The game is kind of crappy and for some reason keeps sending a shutdown signal to my computer but for $2 I get a couple hours of fun turning Best Korea into glorious worker's paradise. I expected much better from something with the Paradox name on it but what can you do.  I give it a ヽ(´ー｀)ノ/10   Also, the description made me think that this was some super autistic game with such depth and complexity that there were AI advisors that made decisions for you since you couldn't possibly manage everything on your own. In reality the AI advisors are needed because the UI is so awful that you can't possibly find and react to what you want to do in time.",
