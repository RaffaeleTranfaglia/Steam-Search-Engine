            "review_text": "This game feels like some one saw astroids and said 'Hey what if we took this and make it bigger and better.'  WARNING this game becomes addicting I was gonna try it just because its free... yea FREE and ended up playing for a few hours replaced my ship, upgraded my ship got a wingman ... he ended up crashing into an astroid as we were going as fast as possible at the time and his armor was made of tissue paper so Wasp RIP.   Truly a great game that can run on most pc's and the fact its free leaves no excuses try it out what do you got to lose except an afternoon after this damn game sucks away the day.  What i would like to see in the game... more ways to make money seriously 90% of my time on the game was sitting in an astroid belt using the gun with unlimeted ammo to blast away at astroids and collect money... so an idea is maybe adding quests like hiring your self out as a merc or hunting bounties just some ideas.  Would also like to see better ship controls as of now there is only the foward button that i saw. why not add ships/upgrades like retro thrusters to come to a stop or correct course.   Would also like to see way points added this map can be huge when not using the fast travel system so i would like a way point to guide me so i wont crash checking my map ... Seriously thats how I died the first time Speed+map checking+ astroid = a bad time.  Other then that great game guys seriously its not often i find a game worth reviewing on steam so keep up the good work would love to see what you got coming down the pipe line and Please oh Please keep this game free 8)",

            "review_text": "While it generally is quite a fun game to play, and is quite a good time waster, there are some things that put me off from really reccomending this game to people. Here are my points,  1. After clearing out pirate activity on planets (At least, I assume the skull and crossbones mean pirate activity), there isn't much else of a goal to work towards. Sure, you can buy the biggest ship and get the best guns you can find, but, that's more of a means of getting somewhere, not a goal in itself.  2. Clearing out pirate activity. Now this may sound strange when you look back on point 1, but read on. It's never really clear how you wipe out the pirates, but when you do it, you have no idea how or why the dangerzones have disappeared on the map. The only in-game goal in Destination Sol is basically clearing this out, but it seems so easy to do that it just seems that if I buy a bigger ship, they just disappear straight away.  3. Unclear main menu. There is hardly something in the way of options, you get just a few buttons for a set few resolutions, windowed or fullscreen, and sound volume from off to very high. While I am aware that this is a free game, there should've been put a little bit more thought into the options menu regardless.  4. Performance. While the game runs very smoothly on my low-end PC, there is one big glaring issue I have. -It randomly freezes up my entire computer, thus having me hard-reset the thing- I am unsure if this is the case for other people, but if it is, there need to be some patches made to fix this.   My suggestions would be to add clear objectives and goals to work towards, adding missions, making it clear how to fulfill those missions and objectives and when you have fulfilled them. Make the menu a little more clear, perhaps with some sliders, for example, for the sound volume, and patching the game so that it doesn't freeze up computers at random.    Minor nitpick: I have also run into some planet-related glitches. When tackling turrets on various planets, I often find myself warped into the terrain, unable to escape, thus having to exit the game and start a new one with my previous ship, or respawning (Which takes away some of your resources (Ammo, cash). Again, this is something that could be easily fixed.    All in all, I did find this an enjoyable game, but the lack of goals, some glitches and PC-Freezing make it less fun than it could have been.",

            "review_text": "6.4 - Tokyo Drift in Space  This game shows a lot of promise. I was able to use my steam controller to play the game but I prefer the keyboard still for this one. Pretty simple space shooter game with some interesting twists. In addition to exploring and killing enemies you can engage in meteor mining to grab a few coins and upgrade your rig.   It's open world but that's somewhat cheating since it's a space game. I'd like to see some more elements floating around. They did a good job incorporating a map and different space stations, however navigation to and from can be pretty desolate. No other players in this one. It would be a great multiplayer game!  The controls are really challanging, but also really rewarding when you are successful. You must drift, and orbit using only thrust and ship direction.   It's Free! I'd check it out for sure.

Open world...go ahead and fly twords that planet with a big flashing skull on it! Planets....you can fly to planets and gravity is in effect...don't worry.. you don't take damage from flying into everything. Easy controls, use W to fly in the dirrction of your pointer. Instant mining...shoot asteroids and cash comes out...no need to refine and sell anything. Your first gun has unlimited ammo....gather lots of cash before you upgrade to a gun/ship that does need ammo.  Cons: I couldn't find anything that resembled a goal or quest. Just shoot things and get new toys. Not really a con for everyone, I just like goals. Easy controls, sort of. Apparently we can fly all over the galaxy but no one invented reverse thrusters. I keep hitting S to try to slow down....it doesn't work....get handy at spinning your ship around 180 to slow down. Ammo...somewhat limiting. Most guns take some kind of ammo that you can buy at a station or loot if your lucky. If you run out you are unable to fight until you get more. If you run out of cash and ammo...  Overall a great little game. Plays in a window or full screen. Will be my new work time waster.",

Either uprade each ship seperately with money (preverable, giving money actual value) or just bigger differences in hulls other than just durability. see below for those ideas: - increasable number of weponslots (for example three light weapons firing on one click, two heavy weapons seperately) - increasable ammocapacity (kinda like borderlands, or dependand on your hull [big ship=big capacity, etc.]) - flightperformance (accelaration, topspeed, tolerance to crashing, durability in proximity to sun) - tougher enemytypes / enemies leveling with you (getting bigger guns or appearing in pairs as you progress)   i have more ideas but i would be happy if you considered even one of them. I think your game is really promising, inspite being underdeveloped contentwise. This is my first contribution to steam so take that as APPRECIATION! later dude",

This game certainly has a lot of potential and I am excited to see what it becomes in the future, however, in it's current state it seems fairly empty to me. Destination Sol has all the mechanics it needs to become a great game, but it seems almost devoid of content at this point, I mean, it's tagged as an RPG but doesn't even have any quests (I think, I havn't played a massive amount). When this game gets some content to make it feel less empty, I will wholeheartedly recommend it, until then, I give it a 5/10, however if you're just looking for something to waste a couple minutes on, get it now, it's free, there's no reason not to, but if you are looking for an immersive gaming experience to play for hours on end, I see no reason to download this game.  Quick Review:  Pros - 1. Free. 2. Fun if you just want to blow stuff up and crash into things, and admit it, we all want to do that sometimes.  Cons- 1. Is quite empty in it's current state.  Tips For Developer: 1. ADD CONTENT! At this point Destination Sol is all mechanics and nearly nothing else. 2. Change the name, unless I'm completely missing the point of the game and I'm supposed to be going to the Sol system instead of wandering around fighting pirates, the name doesn't really fit with the rest of the game. 3. Make the ship respawn automatically when you die, it makes the game seem more polished, just a tip though, not really a major thing to fix. 4. Change the title screen, when I first got to the title screen I thought I had accidentally downloaded a horror game, it just looks like it would set the mood for a horror game better, try a sleek, futuristic look for the title screen if you change it.",

I just got his today and it's fantastic, the classic pixel style the game has is great, the sounds are nice, and the gameplay is fun and enjoyable.  The Pros: I really enjoyed the gameplay, the different ships and weapons are very fun and very different. The world while not huge, still very expansive for such a small game with many different types of challenging and fun enemies. The AI is hilarious as I found some of the trade ships running right into the sun.  Not too many cons other than it is a short game atm, I found a few bugs due to falling into the ground of planets unable to get out but it only happened a couple times.  Verdict: I found this a very fun game, I'm a huge fan of anything space, and I really hope they add to this game in the future, totally reccomend you at least try it.",

As of now, the resolution is stuck where it is, with no way to adjust it. Full-screen and windowed is the same, the screen just stretches for full-screen. Very few choices in the stores, and very few ways of making money. You're stuck to either getting into firefights with pirates, for a little money, or mining asteroids, for even less money. If you feel adventurous, you can go to the planets and fight even tougher enemies. But, with the lack of weapons, shields, ships, and everything else, you have no worthwhile things to spend that hard-won money on.
