            "review_text": "As much fun as I had with this game I feel there are some problems that greatly impact the game, before we begin i'd like to point out that I understand what I complain about are game mechanics and I am simply giving my opinion on them.  For a game that encourages creativity in tanks, more often than not you'll find that anyone who has played for a couple of hours will be using the same two types of tank, a gatling tank with tank treads, or a sniper with legs, the latter being the biggest pain at the beginning of the game.  (I apologise if this sounds like a rant) At the beginning you start with a tank with 75 health, with ok-ish movement speed and ok-ish damage. The most common sniper rifle on this game deals 75 damage...see the issue? You can be battling it out with other tanks, come out victorious, and immediately die to a sniper bullet from a tank perched on top of a building, which he got to due to his legs, of which you had no way of surviving. Just ignoring the fact that snipers can cloak anyway to keep their position hidden, you have little to no way of dealing with said sniper...you can't climb the building, you don't have the same legs as he does, and the beginning cannon fires a inaccurate small explosive with an arc, meaning you can't damage him either, leaving him to snipe you again and again happily, or eventually get taken out by someone who can actually reach him. This on its own will spoil most beginners gameplay, as many filled servers will have 1-3 snipers atleast on a team of 6+, yet snipers remain a pain even in later gameplay, simply taking a second shot to kill you instead of just 2. Come on...in a game where you can roam around on a ball of goo with a flamethrower they decide the most fun they can have is standing perfectly still, firing off insta-kill shots until they run out of ammo, climb down the building, climb up, repeat until they either win or lose.  The next is the gatling, which tosses any notions of accuracy out of the window and just spams you with bullets, making quick work of anything that isn't heavily armoured, again also fairly common, and while yes...I understand these are effective builds...it just ends up like games such as loadout, where the 'options' for customisation become invalid and you just rush into battle again and again with the same tank, or try to build something new, only to be demolished by the two 'best' tanks currently, bringing me onto the next problem.  In most games you have something to work for...usually in the forms of levels to unlock more content...this game has levels, but has no purpose to them...they aren't displayed at all besides lobbies (of which you just instantly enter games anyway) and really serve anything more than to give you a rank you really don't care about...which means eventually, you will just be doing the same thing, with the same tank, over and over again, for no reason.  On a positive note, the game is fairly sound, with little to no bugs, ignoring the single time one of my tanks legs got itself stuck into the floor, leaving me on my side until something finally killed me.  All in all, the game is fun for about an hour or two...just don't expect days worth of gameplay out of it, unless you plan to screw over other new players as one of the two tanks mentioned before, but in my opinion...you'd get more goofy fun out of robocraft over this.  Edit: Through the comments i've come to the conclusion that if a beginners league was added to seperate the higher levelled players from the newer ones, this game would be alot more playable.",

            "review_text": "Pros: -Nice, cartoony look. A brief reminder of when things aren't brown and grey. -Most of your points will come from winning, not getting the most kills. -You can buy any part, any time as long as you have the points. -The parts are very well balanced. Expect to all of them of the course of your play. Well, except for the medic parts. -Many parts are reachable within a few rounds of play. -The starter parts are actually good. Even my super-epic tank of motar destruction has fallen to many a shot from a noob with good aim and smart driving. If you can compensate for bullet drop, you can hit anything and take a good chunk of their health out. -Speaking of, most parts only get overpowered because of the skill of the person behind them, not the stats. When a chaingun tank runs up and turns you to scrap, don't immediately buy that part and expect to do the same thing. -The parts that aren't weapons will range from light and speedy to heavy and tanky, and then toss in a ton of parts with unique abilities. -The weapons are very creative. Every one has it's place where it shines. -Maps are non-linear, leading to situations in Conquest where the enemy is holding out on a tower... Right next to your spawn. Constantly requires that you change up your tactics when things go to the unexpected. -The radar is... interesting. It always shows where friendlies are but enemies are only shown when your radar waves pass over them. Oh, and there's no way to hide from the radar. Stealth missions require hope that the enemy is looking the other way.  Cons: -You don't get quite enough garage slots at the beginning. Leveling up will help, but still. -The sniper guns push a completely different style of play from all the others. The most powerful one can kill a starter tank in one shot. Tankfully (heh) the death cam will point out where they're hiding, so you can remove all of their 50 health from their worthless shells. -No dedicated servers or server software. All rounds are player-hosted. This leads to issues when the host exits and the identification servers tosses out a good game. -Some parts are seen just a little more often than others. -Even though this is the type of game you would want to play on a laptop whenever you have the time, the visual options just don't drop low enough for me.",

This would be a fun game if i could be bothered to sit and wait for ages for the load screens...  On the whole, wonderful idea, battles can get nuts and level means nothing you can just as easily destroy high level players with your default tank. I would certainly recommend this game if you're looking for a new addictive game to play when you're bored.  use your start off tank. fight. get coins. put more guns on your guns. etc etc! enjoy!",

The graphics aren't realistic, but they are pretty good quality. The feet actually move at the same pace as the ground, which is nice. It's a cartoony style, but that actually adds to the game.

Lets start with the visual part:  Graphics  Shaders, post processing, high-poly models and good looking sprites. Nothing bad on this part. Graphics are great.  Now, what about game balance? Not an 10/10 by any means, but not unbalanced either. Snipers ruin the game fun, they are often very hard to target and with massive amounts of health. Games are often lost with one team being significantly worse than the other one. Not slightly, significantly. I'd give it a 7. Remove those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sniper rifles and try to balance the teams more: got yourself an 10. Anything else? Advertise the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. There is nothing bad to it. This game withing an average would be an YES. Vehicle painting seems not used. Because most of the game modes are team deathmatch and conquest, the vehicles are hardwired into red and blue colors. Suggestion would be to let user paint their cars on those gamemodes, but give teammates an blip above their vehicle letting user know if the approaching vehicle is from an opposite team or not.  But yes, let us paint more, remove those mother trucking snipers and maybe a little game balance. Otherwise, i'd give it an 8.5/10. Download it you mongrel. Its free.",

You get alot of the currency and u can use it to tinker and buy more parts to test new stuff for ur little death machine. Map variety is really nice, ranging from asphalt roads to bumpy dunes, day and night maps as well. Combat feels smooth and great. I have pretty much tested all weapons, and almost all parts:  The game is pretty well balanced, never felt like something (weapon or chasis) is op or broken, u always lose something and gain something in return, depends on how u tinker ur tank and ur playstyle. The servers are stable, i didn't exprience any connection problems with the servers or random DCs in my game time. Other then some rare crashes (once in 2-3 hours if at all) and few players here and there that have lags, i have pretty much nothing bad to say about this game.

After a match you get points, with these points you buy diffrent tank parts, but after a match you don't get many points, and, like i said it gets boring after a while. Any way like i said im still a rookie to and this is just my personal opinion, but the game is free so you can give it a shot and who knows, maybe you might like it.",

It quickly turns into a 'hope that you get on the same team with someone with strong stuff' kind of thing. It's impossible to find people near your skill, and has similar gear to yours. It's very easy to join a game where you will just continuously get killed by a guy camping on a roof, and is also invisible. This, I could deal with, I would just need to learn how to dodge, where to spawn, and how to find him/her. That would be true, if there wasn't someone with 300 health running around spamming rockets everywhere. The amount of kills/captures you have to get just to get 1 extra coin is ridiculous. I have to kill 10 people for just 1 coin? Why is that a thing? I would understand if that were the case for Capture the Point(Or whatever it's called), but it's for Team Deathmatch and Deathmatch too? So, this turns into a grind-for-3-hours-and-get-20-coins thing. Also, it may sound ridiculous, but, why can't we just buy another load-out for about maybe 15-20 coins? Just 1? Would that hurt? Also, another thing. Why can't items you buy be more of a trade-off kind of thing, rather than there just being direct upgrades? I can see the cheap items have that system, but why not all items? Anyways, i'm done with this rant. If you're the type of person that can stay up all night getting spawncamped by an invisible robot spider spamming pokemon macros in the chat just to be another invisible robot spider, than this game is for you.

I suggest health restore 50 health instead of 25 and ammo packs restore 75% of ammo instead of 100%.  Any way it's a cool game and it's worth to spend time on it. I strongly recommend you guys to play it.",

I am hated in every single match. xD  Pros: -Buying parts is easy... For almost every victoroius match you get 4 points and parts are worth 5 - 12. (not including decorations) -Nice cartoony graphics. -Lots of rockets flying through your screen. -If you are good sniper, there WILL be rage on you.   Cons: -Random shutdowns -To unlock some kind of new mode (single player bot fights) you have to buy premium. If you buy premium you will get all of the parts. So, when you have all of the parts whats the point in this game?  I cant give to this game STRONG 8 / 10 among F2P games.",

I love the customization, everyone will customize their vehicle to their liking, and very rarely have I seen two of the same vehicle. However, some thing's dont seem right. For example, I built a spider-tank with 225 HP and a large cannon on the front which was supposed to do 60 damage per direct hit. Sounds pretty powerful right? Well, you would be wrong, as a starter vehicle was able to destroy me. Why? He got the jump on me. Literally the only reason. Think of that what you will. Another problem I had with this is the pricing of items in the game, as well as the storage mechanic. In order to build vehicles in the game, you are required to buy items using a currency called 'G'. What is the problem of this? Items cost up to 15 'G' in game, and you will only get 3 'G' per game, unless of course you manage to destroy 10 other vehicles, which will earn you one more 'G'.Then there is the storage mechanic. In the beginning of the game you will only have storage for 6 parts. But you only get storage for 1 more part whenever you level up. Not to mention the fact that, even if you spent 15 'G' on a part you will only get 1 'G' for selling it. Which makes it a problem to try and store lots of items. But despite these flaws, I keep playing it. The game is fun to play, and in the end, Isn't that what matters? Also when it says free, they actually mean free.",

Even on the lowest settings the game still plays terribly. It's not as if this is a game with next level AAA graphics or something right? The second major flaw is the completely ♥♥♥♥ matchmaking/connection issues. I've only been able to get into 3 games so far- half the time It just says connecting, but never gets anywhere. It would be nice if at least we got a return of connection failed or something like that. Anyways I'm going to play more to see if I can't fix these issues.

You still have to unlock the parts with in game money if you pay.  Eventually parts space stops mattering anyway considering that with 12 spaces at level 7 (where I currently am after 16 hours of gameplay) you aquire in-game money at rate that allows you to basically sell the parts you dont need and buy the ones you do with ease. For example: I have 92 Gs. The most expensive part is 12 Gs. In a short conquest match (less than 2 minutes on Oasis) you can earn 3 Gs if your team wins. I can sell an originally 12 G part for 4 Gs (maybe more) and then buy whatever other part I want with all the Gs I've aquired with relative ease.   Your tank only has space for 5 non-cosmetic parts at a time anyway so with 12 spaces you could technically have space for 2 builds. Obviously someone who pays will never have to sell parts in exchange for others but it really isnt much of a hassle to do so and , in a way, by paying you elimate the only real purpose to leveling in this game which kind of kills the fun.",

There is also vehicle customization which by itself is fun to do, although there are not loads and loads of parts... the vehicle you create is pretty much always unique.  All together if you like Robocraft and TF2... you will love this game! 9.5 / 10  (Edit) This is a while later and I am starting to re-think all of the above...  The screen freezing is becoming VERY frequent now and now leading to game crashes most of the time, it is starting to be overrun by SMG robots like Robocraft whhich is very dissapointing. All of the glitches are very frequent now and are INFURIATING, I have probably lost about 12-15 gold because of these glitches. Changing my rating.

Your starting tank is fine and dandy, and only really good against those of your own skill/level. But there's no true match making or anything to really determine what and who goes where. Instead, everyone has a choice of lobby's. These lobby's only have the name of the gamemode, and a vague range of everyone's combined level. All this does is makes it difficult to say 'well, okay this is a game made for my grouping.' because even if you manage to get like, at least 2 new players, the mass of small crafts, snipers and everything else will -ruin- this game for you.  If you're just starting out and you try and play you honestly can't if you have these players with small crafts zooming around you, making you look like a fool because your tank can't spin fast enough or whatever else might be the problem. I will admit, the first half-hour of this game, i LOVED it, it was an amazing, silly and enjoyable game. Yet, it then showed its' dark side. The community of nothing but stealth snipers and high bloom. Climbers and hovercrafts that zoom around you. The community, ruined this game, as well as the practical pay to win/play mechanic dev's seem to thive over instead of just allowing players to have a simple, enjoyable time and depend on the cosmetics instead of the weapondry to earn pay.",

Game won't stay in fullscreen mode but you can maximize the play window. 2. It does not recognize all of my mouse buttons in the configuration. I had to rely on some pretty screwy workarounds for changing weapons. 3. Virtually no teambalancer or clientfinder. This can result in some Pay 2 Win situations with overloaded players in newbie games. 4. Games are instanced and it doesn't seem like there are a lot of dedicated servers and it doesn't seem like there is a handoff feature. Prepare to suddenly lose connection to a game when the host rage quits.  A lot of potential here. The bad side of that is that the potential is largely in missing basic features of modern games.

Try to stick to conquest early on Deathmatch and TDM are rather crap for low levels in my personal opnion. The currency in the game does need to be boosted in terms of losing/winning atm its kinda low and losing sucks pretty bad with the current way games are setup but despite what all these people say about currency or (G) taking to long to get it really doesnt... I got my first set of Spider legs and a Sniper within my first hour of this game, after that I was set for life(Snipers are actually pretty OP if you know where to setup and how to aim) although people will rage and call you a noob for sniping if they use slow tanks.

Such variety. Many cool. Wow. -Strategy is dominated by snipers. The only way to beat spider-tank snipers is with more snipers. +There are so few problems with the gameplay that I have to nitpick about snipers so I don't seem one-sided.  Free-to-play model: 9/10 +Good overall. Free players level up quickly, earning enough points to buy a new part every three matches. +++No microtransactions that I can find. Seriously, Doctor Entertainment is credit to team.  Uniqueness: 5/10 +The art style is cute. I get a serious micro-machines vibe, which hits me right in the childhood. -The market has robot-building games out the wazoo. Robocraft, Terratech, From the Depths, AirMech, M.A.V., Guns and Robots, and the list goes on and on. Gear Up seems to be just the latest to jump on the bandwagon. -This feels like War Thunder meets Robocraft, but without the customization, strategy, or destruction physics of either. -As robot-building games go, this one really has little customization.  Technical: 2/10 ---The Traktor game engine may offer nice physics, but its performance is a travesty. On a decent PC (80+FPS on TF2), with the graphics all turned down as far as they'd go, the game ran at 15FPS (measured with FRAPS, not the in-game utility, which falsely reported over 100). -15FPS. -Brutal crashes. Don't try to change the texture quality. Just... don't. -15FPS. -Load times indicate the use of hamster messengers for data transfer. -15FPS. +Good audio options. You can change ambient sounds, vehicle sounds, and music independently. -15FPS. +Fully customizable gamepad. About time more developers started doing that. -15FPS.   Summary: If you really like the artstyle and direction this game takes, and that is enough to lure you away from the endless stream of other Robot Wars wannabes, then yeah. Take a look. It might just captivate you. This being said, I can not recommend investing in this game until Doctor Entertainment shows that they can get their engine running better.      -15FPS.",

I prefer Robocraft with it's actual customization, not a limited pool of parts to pick and 'customize' from.  *edit*  Gave it another chance, thinking maybe I just got into some bad games my first time around.  Nope.  Your starting gun is laughably ineffective, and trying to grind out the coins to buy any real upgrades is ♥♥♥♥ing arduous. I played in 6 different games this session, 4 of them I disconnected and got ♥♥♥♥ing nothing, one I lost (and though I somehow managed to scrape out the second most kills, I still got only one medal) and the other I won for 3.  That put me halfway toward buying one of the lower tier upgrades, with the actually powerful stuff locked off behind an insurmountable number of coins.  If I could stay connected, and actually was guaranteed to get any kind of reward for the time invested, it might be worth playing - alas, the network issues make that a guarantee in the opposite direction. You will lag, you will disconnect, and you will get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.

My second piece of advice is to get good, the basic equipment is good and will last for a fair while. Also, buy support guns first and foremost. just buying one support gun can fill both of your support slots.  This is a fun game with tight controls and lots of fun parts to choose from.

            "review_text": "Gear Up's customization is very simple, not complex.  Tanks consist of 4 main parts: Propulsion, Hull, Turret, and Weapon and then there are decoration parts.  Some parts grant the ability to add Auxialry parts that are either weaponry or mobility related and you can mix and match AUX parts. There are also accessories and flags, of which some accessories allow for unique in-game taunts.  Gameplay is equally simple. You use WASD to move with the propulsion you equiped, mouse to rotate and aim your turret. You can rebind your functions to make certain functions easier to reach.  There are a few things I must make you aware of though: - There are only 3 game modes; Conquest (capture markers and hold claim to them), Deathmatch, and Team Deathmatch - All games are hosted by fellow players -no dedicated servers. - There is no engine brake; Hovercraft/floating legs will creep backwards. Bug legs will do the same ontop of objects such as on domes, but do not creep backwards from standstill when on solid ground. - There is no feature to switch teams, thus don't expect to make clans (I actually find this a positive thing) - There is no auto balance of teams based on rank, team count, nor kill counts - If ia game is 8 v 8 team and all but one of the other team suddenly disconnects the game is 1 v 8 (happy hunting) and on rare occasion the game glitches and puts all players on the same team. - Snipers are trouble for new players, but so are harpoon+spear builds, builds that run say machinegun+minigun extensions, etc. You will eventually be able to get the same things (no need to pay money) provided you stick with the game long enough and amass G coins to get your upgrades. - G coins can not be bought and can only be earned through in-game participation, victory, or every 10 enemies destroyed -thus the game is accurately classified as FTP.   EDIT FEB 21, 2015: The DEVs have been doing a good deal of considering suggestions and actively updating to resurrect issues (glitches, rendering problems) that were making the gameplay unbearable for a decent number of players.  NOTE: A lot of new players cry that this game is pay-2-win. This is not true. A lot of players who have powerful builds have not purchased BASIC nor PREMIUM. If you do not have the pateince to perservere as a new player and learn the ropes by being tossed about, you will never get to the point where you yourself have a more robust inventory of parts. Every game will net you at least 1 G just for being a participant in the match. You keep your spirit up for enough matches and you will find that after hours you suddenly have better parts, are doing better, and can actually be competitive. We all tend to suck at this game.
