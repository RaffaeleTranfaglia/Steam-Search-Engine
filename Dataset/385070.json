I rolled my eyes initially when I saw the graphics which reminded me of the Diablo I era. However the game quickly won me over with it's story, characters, and old school RPG gameplay. The turn based, min/max skill point based on equipment gameplay is similar to RPG's from the NES/ Gameboy era however not nearly as frustrating. The story is rich and engaging and you will eventually stop noticing that the graphics are poor. This game is a prime example on how gameplay and story can make a game rise above graphics.",

And nope I buyed that game in the Astronomic Game Bundle so no Idea why it says I received it for free.  Within traditional classic rpg style canevas, this games with two path (yeah replayability!).  Made me wince and smile and kinda inspired me in the end. I was on edge most time of the gameplay.  Tought pretty short and linearI reccomend that enjoyable game for all of its assets uses and how everything that had been staged to make a nice little world to two nice little stories we might not forget soon.  Despite few unhindering bugs, It is hard to pause the game or not make a lotta saves! Also, thought I never tried, if you are a story driven player, apparently you can go alltrough the story without even a single battle. :P The author also warns when to save on another slot. Just in case!",
