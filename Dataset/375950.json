            "review_text": " Disclaimer: I beta tested this game.   Viridi is exactly what it says on the tin: it's a little virtual garden where you watch your plants grow.  The gameplay itself is minimalistic. Apart from planting your succulents, watering them, and zooming in to sing at them, there's very little else you can do. It's supposed to be a very zen experience — similar to keeping actual plants — so if you expect more interactivity than that then this is not the game for you. I usually had it on in the background while I went on with my day as always (hence my exorbitant playtime), but you don't need to leave it on all the time. Your plants will grow just fine while the game is closed as well, so if you only want to spend 5 minutes a day checking up on your plants, then you can do that too. As you can see the joy of the game doesn't lie within its interactivity, but rather within owning a virtual garden in itself.  While this game does have micro transactions, it's entirely possible to play it without ever spending a single penny on it as you start out with 10 plants and you get a free seedling every week.  I very much enjoy playing this game. It's an extremely niche title, but if this game sounds like your cup of tea, I fully recommend you give it a try. It's free so there's literally no downside to trying it out either.",

            "review_text": "As in real life you can have your own plants watch them grow, water them, so ... what does make this game different to real life plants?  Well 'Viridi' is a very relaxing 3D garden simulation game, created with Unity engine.  You can plant colorful plants, many species from every parts around the world, watching them grow meanwhile you're listening relaxing music makes this game very relaxing after a stressful day.  Another point is that you can have a lovely snail, which i named Bob, that makes this game mor interesting. You can give a name for every plant, including your pot.  Microtransactions aren't so bad (prices are lower tha other items on market), to get achievements you have to buy more plants (collect them all dammit), but you can get one for free weekly.  If you love plants and snails, you will love this game.  10 / 10",

It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok. You are growing many plants in a big pot of dirt. As much fun as watching Plants grow. You can water and sing to each plant. You can remove weeds. It takes a few days for plants to grow. Log in once a day for a few minutes, check each plant for water and pick weeds out. Game is easy to figure out how to do things with your mouse and arrow keys. Has a background music mute. Press 'z' to toggle the UI control. You can rename plants and snail and give the pot a name.  Has Steam Achievements for maturing and flowering each plant. Has a random plant reward for once a week in the in-game store menu. When you get a new plant you can place it in your garden and remove plants that you have the acheivements for. You can pick up plants and replant them in a different place in your pot. Use the in-game store for info about and size requirement of plant. Check the steam forum of the game for the plant trading thread and other tips.  Try it, maybe you might like it.

I already collect real succulents, but now it seems i can have both real and virtual succulents at the same time.

In Viridi you get random plant per week for free [as a bonus I guess for coming back] and if you can't wait you can buy plants from 9 cents &amp; up to 23 cents as I remmeber [23 or 32 but not more than 32 thats for sure]. There are 23 plants which I could find igstore and as plants grow in 'real time' you cant just replace them on daily basis and see which one is better. Its like a garden in a pot.  You need to water plants occasionaly so they dont die and if you going away for long you can activate 'Vacation' which will freeze/pause the growth of your plants so you don't need to worry about watering them until you come back.  Calm music will surely make you relax so if you want some background relaxing music then you should surely try it out.  It has steam inventory as well which is an awesoem thing to have for a collectionaire [Me]. I am not quiet sure yet of the store items which cost 3 &amp; other one for 5 euros [the only 2 items apart from plants igstore] but they seem to change the background or something more than just a plant so I will update the review when I find out.  To summorise its like a tamagochi except its at a slow pace, like realy slow one &amp; as its free I cannot put thumbs down even for micro-transactions which could be by-passed using random free plant per week.",

There's no tutorial since its such a simple game, but that resulted in me choosing an initial set up I wasn't too fond of because I thought I could change it. I also accidentally over watered and killed a plant. There are beautiful flowers that sprout, and I'm sure that they don't last long IRL, but I'd like to see them last longer than 15 seconds since this is virtual and not real. What would really make this more enjoyable is multiple pots. I could replant suculants I don't want in the other one and it would add to the difficulty of keeping multiple ones alive. IDK maybe that's in the paid version...  Micropurchaces aren't really a big deal since you earn random seeds each week.   Overall I still find myself logging in every day to see if there are new seeds and remove grass.",

I like to open it every other day or so for a little while to listen to the music, watch my plants grow and snail make his rounds around my pot. How this little game plays is you get a pot and a choice of a few succulents, or seeds and to choose what pot you'd like to plant them in. You can get more succulents by paying for them with extra pennies, or you can wait a week, and you'll get a free one. You then get to watch the little ones grow into fully matured little plants, accompanied by beautiful music and a cute little snail. You water the plants by clicking on them and clicking a little circle icon with a little squirt bottle on it, it's easy to accdently overwater them by mistakenly clicking the icon multible times (That I occasionly do) but the little plants normaly forgive you for making mistakes. The plants grow in real-time, but if you close the game and wait a few hours or a day or so, you get to watch from the point when you closed the game, up to right then letting you see your little plants grow much faster.",

If you don't want to pay, they'll still reward you with an additional seed once a week. There are additional things you can buy like a 'map to a grove' that seems to indicate you can plant a new pot but I don't understand how the two are connected.   There are no instructions so expect some frustration figuring things out. It feels like a phone game translated poorly to PC. The UI is nondescript and clicking directly on the plant you need to water doesn't work right. Strangest of all, as of the time of this review, there's no way I can see to exit the game other than Alt-tabbing and closing the window via the taskbar.  Still, once you get through the initial aggravation, the game is fun to jump in and out of for a few minutes for some quick weed pulling and watering. Don't miss more than one day or they'll start drooping. You'll get an achievement if you're able to grow your plant to maturity. I do a lot better with this virtual plant than I do with real ones.  One more thing, the snail farts when you pick it up.",

The main plot is nothing more than managing your own pot with flowers.

Even if things have a price in this game, you can manage on the free seedlings given to you each week, and those objects that are free from any cost.

IMPORTANT TIP: When you begin, water your plant 1x EACH. NOT MORE! You'll flood them, stunt their growth! You get a free plant every week.  As for the rest, if you buy any other Steam game and have leftover change... plants start at $0.09 USD each. You have $0.55 leftover from a recent game purchase??? This game is perfect to dump it on.  You can also 'sing' to the plants by zooming in on them. This speeds their growth greatly. You can only do this to one plant at a time. So choose your main plant, and leave the game open overnight as you sleep - turn off the music. You can sing to THE SNAIL too. It appreciates it. You can also water the snail... you can FLOOD the snail, and it doesn't care. So if you're bored, you can wet the snail a lot.

If there is am android version i will switch to that but for now i'm on PC.  that being said, well.... it is what it is. you plant succulents, you water them, you pull out weeds, you watch them grow. pretty simple. the game is relaxing to play though there just isn't much to it.  the art is wonderfull though.

Plants will grow, as will people. You mil plant new seeds and meet new people. Relationships and plants take patience and care to grow. But no matter what, you can never truly remove a plant from your life. You can move it around, underwater it, overwater it, but the plant will still be there, green or brown, sated or overwatered, dead or alive. People never really leave your life. They may move far enough away that you may never see them again, but they will have a lasting effect on your life and they will be a part of you until you buy a new pot.

There are more than a few pot-breaking bugs, however. The camera is a bit restricted, you can't zoom in on any individual thing and the label text is often obscured.

I did, and i love the game!   so what is viridi? its a little game thats about growing your plants in a pot, simple! Then once the little plants reach maturity you can throw them into the wild to make room for new plants, or just keep them. Overall, its one of those games you check up on when you wake up, or at work, or when you first boot up your computer.  Its simple, its calming, and its different! 10/10 snails",

The music while playing is very calming and nice.  Another feature of Viridi is that it runs even if it is closed because it calculates the time you left your plant, so yes, if you play it once, leave it and come back like a month later your plant is dead because you didn't take care of it, like in real life.  The game is free2play. The only other thing you can buy are different seeds for plants and some backgrounds but very very cheap (prices between 9 to 39 cents for seeds and 2-5 dollar for backgrounds and you get a seed for free once a week).

The list was shorter then and not much differnt now. But with a few clicks I found myself downloading a free game with a visualy pleasing name, Viridi. With its extremely minimalistic feel and all the Zen that surrounds it it seemed like a no brainer for the creative mind who tends wander the internet, check their social media feeds, needs a break from work, or some creative influences for projects, art, and/or schooling. Keeping it in a minimized window off to the side almost makes you feel like one of those people who takes care of small plant life on your desk or in a window seal. And seeds can be purchased for cheap (or gifted) for about how much they go for in the real world lol. Seeing as I have yet to even dabble with the numerous backgrounds and other options I will save any further inspections for a more in depth review later. Let me summarize by saying for a free title this game is definately worth it and the in-game purchases are about as expensisve as what you have in your pocket by the end of the day (Donation change).

I'm using my old dual-core system as a way to test performance in games and this one, cause to Unity, hits it a lot, especially in the garden/woods scene, where there's like just graphics from the 90's to show.  Planting here is just tedious. If you really want to do it, do it in real life, because waiting weeks by staring at the empty soil is way more fun than this, and also will teach you something useful.  You don't even have much to do: you select a vase and a pre-made bundle of plants, then remove the wild weeds, water each plant separately by selecting each one of them and then pressing a button, and that's how it always begins, and also everything you have to do. Come back in a day or 2, rinse and repeat.  The graphics are very basic, so much that my ps1 would laugh at it; the sound effects almost non-existant, and the music forgettable. And if that's not enough for you, you can pay micro-transactions to buy new plants and feed the developers.

Was forced to hard restart computer and as soon as it restarted it tried to restart the game on full screen again. Thankfully I had a pending upday or i'd be stuck in a loop. Don't play it until its fixed. Bad annoying glitch!",
