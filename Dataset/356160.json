            "review_text": "It's really underwhelming. You find the door with a rune on it, same FMV video gives you a spell to dispel the rune, then you look around for the letters of the spell in the house. Usually with a minigame-like thing after dispelling the rune. I gave up after the fourth? one, as the game proved way more annoyance than challenge.  The 'A unique and thrilling psychological hidden object quest' with 'A dark and brooding atmosphere that will keep you on the edge of your seat. ' just means a mediocre hidden object game where instead of objects, you only need to find letters because they were easier to place I guess. There is no atmosphere to the game, and the only things that are 'scary' in it are low-quality jumpscares which are expectable and ugly. I can't recommend this to purchase at all, as in it's genre it's incredibly sub-par, and fails to deliver story, tension, or even a proper challenge, be it difficulty- or time-based.",
