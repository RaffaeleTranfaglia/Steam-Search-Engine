You walk around or 'explore' for about 20 minutes, talk to some odd characters along the way and that concludes your experience for 5 bucks. Some people claim you better be high to play this one, even a stoner would hate this game. I'd rather lookup trippy desktop wallpapers than play this game. It's definitely more fun!  The graphics are pretty cool; big puffy clouds and random objects right out of an acid trip. This isn't enough to make the game though, it's very short and the controls make it very difficult to enjoy the exploration. Furthermore, you'll never really know where to go or when you are actually done with this game. It comes down to how long you can waste your time on something like this. I wasted 36 minutes; don't repeat my mistake.  Worth $5? Hahaha. Don't make me laugh.     Accidently Reviewed",
