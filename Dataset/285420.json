Not alot of excitement or crazy plot twists but nicely executed without any serious jumps in difficulty or excessive grinding. The Monster stone system is great and really aids in not having to grind through monsters while retrecking through areas.",

            "review_text": "Pretty decent game. I liked the combat system: it's remniscent of FFX's turn-based time system, but they added threat so that only the person with the highets threat ever gets attacked. It works great. The only gripe I have is that the mage's skill tree is very bland; it's three skills that are exactly the same single-target nuke except with different elements, and then another three skills that are aoe--the same, except for elements. Beating everything on hard and getting all end-game items, killing all optional bosses on the hardest settings, etc. took me about 25 hours so it's a short game; you could probably rush the story in 10-15 hours on normal. I would probably value the game at around $5-$7.",

Only flaws are dungeons can drag on quite bit and map design is all over the place with excessive clutter. The game was still very easy even on hard difficulty except for last boss and optional arena fight.",

Pick this up A.S.A.P - especially with the winter sale price!",
