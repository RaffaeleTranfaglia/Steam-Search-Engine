Very Important note!  the game built for 2 cores CPUs, so it won't run for most PCs these days, I was just lucky to make it run for intel i7  the game feels like Half-life style of walking, crawling, solving some puzzles and shooting. You can call it Activion Half-life if you like.  the unique mechanics are Time Minipulation, slow, stop and reverse time.  Graphics looks amazing even for a 2007 game, the atmosphere and the main color of the game is gray mostly.  it took me 16-19 hours to finish the game, feels perfect for it, not that long, not too short.  just be sure that your PC runs the game before buying it. It's so worth playing if you like good shooters with unique mechanics.  ---------------------- if you got the game up and running, rebind 'X' to 'left Shift', rebind time manipulation functions to other keys as well, if you are using keyboard",

This is a very underrated game that never really got too much attention and that is a shame. It is extremely fun to play with a variety of game mechanics and abilities at your disposal. As you can probably tell it deals primarily with time abilities but has some varied gunplay as well with many interesting ways to approach situations. The unique gameplay is going to be the main focus of the game but the story is interesting enough to at least keep you entertained. 20 dollars is still a hefty price but you get around 7-8 hours of gameplay for the main story plus decent replayablity. This game should be considered a classic and a pioneer. Check it out if you can.",

I can safely say that even now, it still gives me that amazed feeling(even though pc controls are a bit difficult for me). The gameplay is good. The time manipulation mechanic works to keep combat fresh, as well as a puzzle solving tool. It reminds me a lot of Half-Life 2 not only in the gameplay, but the story as well(minus the time manipulation stuff). It looks nice, even on the lowest settings and my dinosaur of a computer can still run it fine. It is a bit dated, I mean it was made in 2007 so what can you expect? I would definitely recommend giving it try for $5.00. I'm not sure if it's worth the full $20.00 price though.... Havn't played much, but I'd give it a 8/10 so far.",

No. Game adjusts timers and cooldowns as creators had planned ahead of you. 'Okay, man, scripted parts are okay, but otherwise you can do what you want!' - again no, your 'mana' meter won't allow you to. It won't be time-travelling kung fu out there, but just spamming Time Stop once in 7 seconds to insta-regen health and continue dodging tons of bullets.  Cool fighting? No. Grab the most overpowered guns in game and hope nobody shpongles charged plasma in your backside.  Cool graphics? Oh well, 2.5 out of 5. Backgrounds and levels are nice and linear, NPC are ugly, and you never see yourself in game. Even hands.  Cool storyline? Err... well, they explained basically nothing. HInts don't tie up into solid story, and there wasn't a solid story to begin with. Even motives and build-up are missing.  Cool multiplayer? Go get Unreal Tournament and forget this, srsly.  Cool cinematics? Yes, 5 seconds each. But hey! - we'll get a nude female once in a while there! Worth it!  My verdict - complete waste of time on our side and questionable waste of money and resources on developer's side. gg 2 ez.",

If you're expecting something like Crysis Power Suit + F.E.A.R. time manipulation, you'll be disappointed. Not only are you super fragile (die from a few bullets), your timeshifting abilities can only slow down time for a few seconds, or pause it for even less time. This is just the worst.

First off even though you are in a high tech time traveling super suit, you are still very fragile. Don't think you can just do a run and gun waltz towards a group of enemies, they will tear you to shreds. Of course you aren't meant play like that, you have to use your time manipulation powers to deal with the baddies.  Speaking of baddies, there is a lack of enemy variety as almost all of them are based around a human holding a gun. You won't find any hostile giant insects, hungry zombies, or evil robots in this game. Still, there are a few specialized enemies that will require the use of time manipulation to deal with time.  In terms of weapon variety, the guns are pretty standard. Assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, etc.  As for the environments, there isn't anything else particularly interesting or memorable about the setting. Still that doesn't mean that the game is lacking in the variety of level environments.  Finally, the story and backstory are rather thin. Perhaps the setting can be fleshed out some more if a sequel is made.",

I had to follow a bad guy who leaped to the past and kill him so there wasn't any complication. The key feature of the gameplay is 3 time-shifting commands.  Slow - slow down the environment and speed up yourself. Mostly used in combat. Stop - stop the environment to make yourself immortal for a moment. Very effective but doesn't last long. Reverse - reverse time of the environment. Often used in puzzels.  The difficulty of the gameplay is relatively easy. If you're skilled at shooting then you may find a bit boring. The lure is dedicated by its atmosphere and time-shifting abilities. The experience of similar FPSs such as F.E.A.R series will help you grasp the way to use the abilities in the earlier stage. I enjoyed most part of battles since I could overwhelm a bunch of enemies who are strong if usual, with the help of abilities. I wondered whether there was any kind of time-paradox theme or something like that, but I don't know at last.",

The time manipulation mechanic expands on what F.E.A.R. called 'reflex time' and allows you to pause or reverse time in addition to being able slowing it down. Switching between the different modes allows for varied and gratuitous ways of dispatching your enemies. Level design is pretty good and the enemy AI is quite challenging. They will try to flank you or flush you out with grenades (or both!). They will even camp above a manhole and wait for you to come out and blow you to bits. There is plenty of CQB inside buildings and even a bit of trenches. There are also a few puzzles which will require you to make use of your timeshifting abilities to get through. The story is a bit sub-par and horribly confusing but then again, who cares about the story when you can pause time, pump a grunt full of holes with your scattergun, chuck a grenade, unpause time and then watch the guy explode in a glorious mix of blood, guts, and buckshot.  If you liked F.E.A.R. or Singularity then get this game too. You will not be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "A solid single player experience to pick up during a steam sale.  The gunplay is decent, although the enemies are bullet-sponges at times. The selection of weaponry is varied and interesting. Whilst the graphics are obviously dated for a PC title, this being a 2007 release, it's not to the degree of being immersion breaking - with the possible exception of the in-engine cut-scenes that features so much cheese they should come with a baguette and some wine.  The premise of the story is interesting, but for me, the pay-off wasn't there in the end. This on account of the developer stripping story elements (mainly concerning the protagonist) out of the game to make people 'identify more with the protagonist' (see interviews written around launch, or alternately wikipedia). Either way, there are some quite interesting CGI cut-scenes that are sprinkled throughout the game that give you a degree of insight in the storyline of the game - all of which become unlocked and viewable from the title menu of the game after completing it.  The star of the show here is obviously the very interesting mechanics revolving around manipulating time. Freeze it to get the jump on enemies and take out a handful of them before they can even realize you're there - slow down time to dodge incoming fire, or take advantage of it by sprinting up to an enemy, disarming them and bludgeoning them to death with their own weapon - or reverse time, to correct your mistakes, or choose another path to get away from that grenade that absolutely positively would have blown you to bits.  There are a few physics puzzles involving the timeshift mechanics, many of which feel gimmicky and as though they were lifted straight out of Half-Life 2. They aren't overly prevalent over the course of the game though, so while not extremely interesting, they aren't detrimental to it either.  TL;DR:  Solid six hour single-player experience that's worth a look during a Steam sale. The plot is interesting, but the story isn't properly wrapped up, and may leave you dissatisfied in the end. In it's own right, the time-manipulation mechanics of Timeshift are more interesting than most stuff we see in shooters these days, and I wouldn't at all mind if we got a remake that brought the game up to date graphically, as well as a slight retooling of the story.",
