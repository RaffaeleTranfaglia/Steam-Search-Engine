            "review_text": "I really enjoyed this. I loved The Banner Saga and this seemed similar so it was inevitable that I would give it a shot. It is somewhat short, yet the atmosphere of the game is excellent and while very similar to TBS in visual style, it is still pleasing and fresh to look at.   The combat can be very hard on higher difficulties (played through one second hardest myself) but is very rewarding as a result of this. A somewhat confusing save system had me replaying quite a hard mission at one point but I actually didn't mind because I enjoyed the combat a lot. There isn't a huge amount of unit variety but I personally didn't mind this too much either because of the generally epic feel of the fights.   Worth the price in my opinion and I would gladly purchase a sequel :)",

            "review_text": "It's very easy to forget that Tahira is the first title of a three man development team. This game has clearly been made with a lot of love and thought, and has been presented with a compelling story accompanying interesting battle sequences. While I miss the Fire Emblem style of levelling up and character growth, it doesn't make sense in a story that takes place over one night. I also feel the developers have really made their game work in the context of guerrilla fighting against unlikely odds.  While the game pacing can feel odd at times, and the presence of some interesting bugs, this is largely to be expected during the early release period of a game, and doesn't detract from the rewarding experience that the game offers. I'm really looking forward to placing the game at different difficulties, and I'm excited to see where Whale Hammer Games goes in the future!",
