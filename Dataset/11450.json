            "review_text": "A hidden gem,  no seriously this is one of the best games I have ever played. The reasons? The minions obviously! They are just hilarious! My favorite part of them is the fact that they can loot equipment so you can have 50 brown fighter minions that look unique and barbaric. Did I mention that they have a hierarchy system too? The strongest minion (and probably your favorite) always goes next to the dark lord and the other line up behind him so at the furthest back you have those newly spawned grunts. You must be careful about the minions that you do care about because if they die they are gone forever. I once had my favorite minion who was wearing a golden crown which he looted from a fat hafling king get smashed by a succubus, oh god did I miss him!   I originally got the game on disk hence the play time.",

            "review_text": "A good console game, similar to Pikmin and Little King's Story.  The game benefits from a very devilish kind of humour, a pretty soundtrack and an amazing art direction. The landscapes look fantastic and the characters are very well designed.  You get to play as the evil Sauron (pre-eye transformation), and control a whole bunch of cutesy gremlins to do your evil bidding. It's always a joy to interact with your minions, ordering them to pillage, kill, steal, or to even (accidentally) commit suicide!  Unfortunately, the controls are a little unresponsive at times, the levels are very linear with too many backtracks, and the gameplay gets a little bit monotonous after a while. There's a little bit of grinding involved as well, if you want to craft better stuff (and you probably should). The online multiplayer mode is pretty much dead.  Despite its many flaws, it's still a fun game. Drowning your first minion will probably become your most memorable and funniest moment in your whole gaming history.",

            "review_text": "I've always been a big fan of this game, hoping sometime there would be another sequel, but it seems the idea was dropped. To give you an idea of how much I adore this game, I've played through it about four times by this point.  There's always question about which Overlord you should pick up if any, the first or the second? Personally, I say both. Here I will just review the first one though.  A fantastic singleplayer RPG with clever humor, good boss fights, enticing story and an interesting combat system that I can't say I've seen in any other game.  You are the Overlord. Your job is to restore your tower to its former glory, convince the lowly townsfolk that you are indeed the Overlord and to wreak havoc with your minions (although sometimes you might decide to be nice to the citizens of your domain to make them praise you rather than fear you)  But what is an Overlord without his minions? There are four types of minions, which you unlock over time, but pretty early in the game you have all four. The first type is your default melee minions that just love to get in trouble and start fights, the second is a ranged type that are terrible in melee but can put out fires and throw fireballs, the third is a sneakier kind that can be used with clever positioning to take out key targets rapidly, but they suffer in direct confrontation, and the fourth is a healer that can resurrect your fallen minions for a while before their corpses decay (They can also swim, unlike all your other minions)  The overlord himself of course also has combat potential. He can hit people with his melee weapon of choice and cast spells that he has unlocked, there are plenty of spells ranging from direct damage (throwing fire at all your enemies and watching them burn to death while laughing horrifically) to buffing your minions (and watching them claw your enemies apart in a maddened frenzy before they start tearing each other apart)  There's also a crafting system that lets you craft weapons and armour with special stat bonuses given by letting your minions throw themselves into the flames to enhance your equipment.  This is definitely one of the most overlooked games that I know of, and that couldn't be a more undeserving title to have.",

Only thing bad I really see is a few minor glitches whereas your minions get stuck in walls and you're unable to retrieve them into your horde. It's simple to get them back.

            "review_text": "Very original idea and runs smoothly and is funny seeing your minions do stuff like jump on a sheep and ride it around while hitting it in the back of the head with a club. It's fun to be the evil overlord and command your minions to run around and murder and ♥♥♥♥ everything up left and right. Pretty funny game. Overlord 2 is cool too and a even better version of the first game. The best part about the game are the fantastic graphics; they are very well done for its time and very pleasant too look at, very colorful, bright and glowing without being offensively bright and colorful. The game looks great.  The only two really bad things I can think of are that 1. it does not have a map, so you just run around till you find what to do and 2. when your health gets low it does a loud heartbeat sound which is horribly annoying and there are never any health shrines near so to make it ♥♥♥♥ing stop I just warp back to the main tower then come back where I was. Never, ever stop playing this game for an extended amount of time or you will forget where you have gone previously and have to do a ton of walking around until you find where it was to go next. It was 5 months in between the last I played and I regret doing that big time after spending two hours walking around until I found the right place. Another problem with the game which actually is not too bad at all is bugs. Sometimes the minion counter will get bugged and show 0/5 when I have 20 standing next to me. It makes them not control right so I have to warp to the tower then back to the area I was in to fix it. Sometimes I can command my minions to go over a bridge to turn a wheel and they get killed by a enemy who I can't make them attack because he isn't quite in the line of sight, making me backtrack a long way to get to a minion summoning mound. Anytime you have to go back a long way to get to a summoning mound to get more minions, which is more often than it should be, it is painfully boring and unfun. The game is also very basic. You just give minions commands and can fight a little and that is about it. It can get boring if you play for long sessions but it is still a great game nonetheless.  Otherwise, it is a great simple idea that is different from all of the other games out there and like I said it is hilarious to command your minions to run up and destroy everything, breaking pots and crates to find gold and carry it back to you saying things like 'for you, master!' and knocking down halflings homes and setting them on fire, killing enemies, and whatever other tasks.  The game is predictably somewhat linear, but hey, what game isn't. I am usually having too much fun to notice. Could've been a 8 or 9 out of 10 game, but because of all its issues I mentioned, 7/10.",

'Overlord' is another variation of taking the player out of the role of being the hero and into the shoes of the bad guy.   The game parodies the typical heroic RPG and the goal is to conquer the lands surrounding your great evil tower, which you can upgrade using the treasures you collect. Also, there are decorative options to get your tower looking good as well.  You can control vast armies of goblins to terrorize the people, collect treasures, and burn villages but to what degree is up to you. The goblins will often make silly comments or jesters while adventuring or pillaging which will make you laugh and chuckle to the very end.  There are various options for upgrading your equipment using the forge in the tower while the goblins automatically equip gear found during raids on the villages or you can direct the horde with a mouse click to a stash of gear to which they plunder and equip if possible—I saw one goblin put a pumpkin on its head for a helmet.  The controls for the horde of goblins are very simple and easy to navigate. You even have the option of splitting the horde into smaller groups and covering more area. Several puzzles will make for a challenge and require you to adjust the type of goblin in your group like melee, range, or magic in order to move forward.  While the main goal is to conquer the lands through ruthlessness or mercy, you also have achievements you can collect and a statistics which shows the amount of total devastation you brought upon the people, which encourages replay.  I recommend the game if you want an action-adventure and RPG game that is hilariously witty but challenging. I also recommend purchasing the expansion which adds even more entertainment and fun.",

The games currency is split into Gold and Life force. You need lifeforce to spawn minions, so you can expect a bit of grinding....  Yeah the game gets that whole 'Third Person action game with RTS elements' right, unlike Brutal Legends. Controlling minions takes a bit of learning, but once you get the hang of it, it's not bothersome at all.  The real joy is the core parts of the game i.e. the minion controlling and puzzling. The remaining parts of the game aren't exciting...I'm talking about the action, story, upgrading and customizing part. The Upgrading and customizing part are More like 'They're there so I'll take it'. The Overlords combat mechanics are silly, but minions make up for it.  Lastly, the part about you being Evil.

            "review_text": "This game deserves some credit; they wanted to use a controller, and give you the kind of control you are used to with a PC. And honestly, they do a decent job, because that's a hard task. When you first start this game, it seems like it's going to be some form of an RTS; you controlling The Overlord directly, but also directing his growing band of minions. The Overlord uses magic and melee, while different kinds of minions attack physically, magically, stealthily, etc, and you control it all directly. Pretty cool.  Well, it should be. Despite doing a surprisingly good job as I said above, there are still many problems. I've quit and reloaded several times (irritatingly limited save system) because my minions have all charged into fire or poison gas or a lake and died immediately because of a button press. My fault, yeah, I did it. But why should it even be possible to murder all your followers by ordering them into a river? Just make them stop at the water's edge so that if I accidentally, even one time, forget to change over to just the minions who walk on water, I don't lose the whole level and die. And this happens more than you would think, because this game is not a strategic combat game, it's an action/adventure game with puzzle elements. The minions are mostly there to get through puzzles that become increasingly irritating. Because the perspective is directly on the Overlord, it can be difficult to control the minions at a distance (in fact, you lose all control after a surprisingly short distance). They run into things, they aren't standing quite where you thought they were, they get lost. It's also kind of annoying to do things like seperate the minions, position them, recall them out of comabey they have been 'locked' in to, etc. Really, the Overlord is actually a pain in the butt; he's a hindrance and a distraction, as he's not very tough or useful most of the time. If he was not there, or just there as a Wizard with a magic barrier who follows the minions around and you just control THEM, it would be far better, because you'd have more buttons to work with, instead of several just to control the very basic avatar. And the puzzles are not hard; it's one of those games where you know what to do immediately, but can't effectively do it. Constantly fighting with hit-and-run tactics, trying to navigate over terrain that's difficult to see (although you can change the camera angle, that robs you of the ability to see more than 20 feet away), it really just drags. The combat parts are the fun parts, and with some tweaking to the mechanics and different levels design, it would of been a fun and somewhat unique combat game. Instead it's an average action-adventure title combined with an easy puzzle game.   It's not terrible, but it's frustrating, and straddles too many fences to offer any depth or satisfaction in any field. The first 2-3 hours were fun, then it starts to slow down, and by ten, I just threw down the controller in frustration, as I couldn't get through 30 minutes without something going royally wrong (including freezes, enemies cheaply spawning right behind you and killing your weakest guys in a flash, and the fact that you can't unsummon your minions when needed). Good effort, in a way, by the devs, but it's not enough to make the game really worth playing.",

I love playing it when I had it for xbox and so decided to buy another version of it through steam however for some reason it crashes just after pressing play. I've had it several months now and it still wont work, I've searched for methods of fixing this problem and nothing has worked. So don't waste your money on it, lucky it was cheap that it was change I lost....",

I wasted SO MUCH TIME wandering around trying to find what I'm supposed to do next (the quest list gives you nothing). The game is appallingly lacking in any direction, instruction, and guidance. Eg. Some areas will indicate where you are going when moving from one zone to the next, by showing what that area is, but most DON'T.  You have to blindly wander to the new zone, wait for it to load, see whats there, then have to retreat (and another load), because it wasnt where you wanted to go.  At one point the game crashed out on me (just after getting the red minions), and now I cant get them again, cant find anything else to do that doesn't require them. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME.   Ive tried playing this game a few times over the years, and every time it ends up just being a boring wander around the countryside. Its a great concept, nice graphics and sounds, and a sense of humour, but the playability aspect SUCKS, the controls are dodgy and cannot be easily changed, difficulty curves are all over the place (mostly too easy, then some too hard). There is no story either (at least as far as I've been able to tolerate playing this piece of crap).   Don't waste your money or the download... I made the mistake of purchasing Overlord 2 also, and don't think Ill even bother to look at it.",
