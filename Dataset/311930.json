If you're into games with solid or unique movement (quake, tribes feel, etc.) this game was built for you. Great price for a fantastic platformer.  -One quick reccomendation- Not sure if the devs read what people say here, but I wanted to comment really quickly on one of the levels in metropolis. In fact, it was the very last level. Anyways. In the last level, you first have climb whilst avoiding yellow bullets that shoot down the sides of the walls you are supposed to use. This is all fine and good, and I really enjoyed beating that part, however, directly after that, you jump to the left and you have to do the same thing, but this time, the platforms are falling. All of that is ok too, except for one thing. On the section where the platforms are falling, I felt like it was a bit random whether I succeeded or not. This is due to the fact that I could not see the yellow bullet things being shot down before I had to jump of the falling platforms. This made it impossible for me to time when I needed to jump onto the falling platforms to continue the level. And since I couldn't time it, I just kept playing till I got lucky. Other people might not have the same patience :P. It's a pretty simple fix, just move the camera to the left a bit during that section or something to that effect.",
