            "review_text": "This is probably one of the few games that still looks good even though it’s an old game. It felt like a mix of XCOM EU and The Bureau: XCOM Declassified but this game was made 4 years before them, I’m very impressed (with anime storyline and artsyle). I will make this review simple and just put up the pros and cons of it Pros:   It scrapped the grid by grid system from most similar turn based strategy game and it actually felt great, you have the freedom to move the character anywhere you want   A really good port, no doubt. It runs great and the controls for mouse and keyboard is good   Battles are always challenging and you need to change your tactic to every battle and adapt with the enemies    The orders system can help you a lot in a battle    Interesting characters (If you’re bothered to read the character glossary but the main characters are interesting enough without reading them imo)   Cons:   Sometimes the menu felt clunky, for example you can’t change your character equipment in the middle of briefing before battle and you have to exit the briefing and go to headquarters, only then you can change your characters equipment. It’s gets a little bit annoying sometimes   Sometimes there’s like an invisible wall on someplace even though your sniper clearly have a line of sight on the enemy but thankfully it’s compensated with the crosshair which turns red only when you have nothing blocking you   New game+ for the main storyline lacks challenge since they don’t change the enemy difficulty so that you can just plough through the mission in like a single turn until somewhere above chapter 10 but it’s compensated with hard and expert skirmishes so I guess it’s alright   Crashes randomly at some point (it’s rare but it does happens)   Cover systems feels lacking, you can only get into cover on sandbags and trenches    It’s amazing that this game was made 6 years ago, the gameplay doesn’t feel dated at all. This game is probably one of the hidden gems of the PS3 era. I weren't a fan of the series but definitely I am now, hope to see the sequels get a proper port on PC as well",

            "review_text": "A job well done, Great port, I can't stress it enough, this port is functional and shows that SEGA are committed to delivering quality PC products.   This is the short answer to what is to expect of this port, of a game actually a few years old, but able to outsell some big players, like certain flops released near this date.  Valkyria Chronicles is a well made strategy game, made with the intention of doing something different from usual. The intent wasn't on having awesome graphics (even in 2008 the graphics were ok) but something beautiful, and even now, six years later, the game still looks beautiful, not at all old.  The plot is engaging, maybe a bit reliant on cliches, but still well done and interesting. Any story about a war not glorifying it, but showing it with fairness (Cruelty, heroism, sacrifice, duty, loyalty...) is always a welcome sight. The main characters are well developed, and the side characters get their own missions to shine.  The music is beautiful, with some tracks being fairly normal, while others are memorable. Voice acting in English is kinda Fairly Bad, while the original Japanese work is polished and flawless.  The controls are well ported, mouse control is smooth and correct, I miss having a cursor in the menus, but the important part (The combat) goes flawless. It also allows controller use, for those who prefer the original experience.  Combat can be as challenging as you allow it to be. Certainly victory won't be an issue most of the time, but getting A rank is another, different, matter. Still, the learning curve is user friendly, as long as the player accepts B ranks for a while.  The Strategic part varies, sometimes being smart allows the player to have really fun combats, while considering possibilities. Other times using strong scouts allows to skip the entire combat by simply rushing an objective fast. It's not cheating, but still, I'd discourage players from exploiting the mechanics for fast victories.  Long story short. This game is cheap, good, it has aged well, the control is good and it's fun. Simply one of the best Tactical Strategy game i've ever played",

            "review_text": "Valkyria Chronicle was one of those big surprise games for me on the PS3.   As a bit of an anime fan I was immediately drawn to the graphics of this game when it was first announced in Japan. When the first english release came out I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I knew I wanted it...   Valkyria Chronicles can be best summed up in the opening lines of the game itself, 'what follows is a chronicle of those fought, lived and died.' Valkyria Chronicles is a character driven strategy game combining turn based elements with third person action.   Every soldier under your command is different, they each have their own capabilities whether that be accuracy or health and all have 'Potentials'. Potentials can range from something as simple as preferring to run over concrete or urban paths leading to a rise in defence to screaming 'VEG-TA-BLES!' when they run over dirt...   Then their are your inter-unit relations. Most soldiers have three other soldiers with whom they like and if within close proximity during an attack, will lend their fire to the attack for extra damage. Then some soldiers just don't like certain individuals to one sniper hating EVERYONE.   The story is great and you'll find yourself saying 'just one more battle!' just to see the next cinematic and seeing how the story evolves and what happens to your favourite characters.   Overall give Valkyria Chronicles a go, you may be pleasantly surprised.",

            "review_text": "This was one of the best games on the PS3 for me, and while I've only given it a quick look on Steam, it seems like a good port. The mouse only works when selecting units in game and for controlling units after you select them (i.e. not during the menu interface), and settings can only be adjusted outside of the game, but that's a lot more port effort than some console ports I've seen. Haven't tried to see if it has gamepad support, but I'll probably play it keyboard and mouse just for the mouse aiming.  As for the game, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes tactical RPGs but is willing to try something a little different. The art is beautiful, the characters charming, the story is great and the gameplay is fun. Your mileage may vary on the between mission stuff. I liked it, but the upgrade system takes a while to get interesting, and I'm sure some people won't have the patience for selecting the next 'episode' of the story.",

            "review_text": "Duration: 40 hours (main game without extras)  Playing Valkyria Chronicles is like watching a Studio Ghibli TV series where in each episode there is a tactical battle that is played in FPS turn-based mode. Without doing a full review the story was top notch and one of the best I've ever experienced in a video game. The art style and animations were top quality and the voice acting was also pretty good. Much of the game will be spent watching these cut scenes which explains the massive 26GB harddrive space needed.   The tactical combat was fun and a wide variety of missions is thrown at the player. The game starts off easy showing you the ropes before you put your team together Jagged Alliance style. The characters have a wide variety of personalities and the game is not without humour.   For the actual combat you have a number of command points to move your characters and issue orders. Once selected it turns into a First Person Perspective for movement. Characters have a finite number of action points to spend moving and get one attack per activation anytime during their move. The blend of FPS and turn-based tactical is unique and flows very well. Defensive fire keeps the tension up.   In between battles there is the headquarters where you can assign experience to your classes, buy R&amp;D, equip found weapons, and a number of other strategic tasks. There are also skirmish battles you can reply if you find your experience of money lacking.   A few negatives keep this from becoming a 10. First are the tank controls. Moving the tank in FPS mode almost works but takes a while to get used to. I spent a couple activations early on spastic-ing in place while trying to inch forward. Sometimes the controls are hard to move forward just a little to repair sandbags or disarm mines.   Another negative is the mid-game battle versus the giant tank which was almost depressing. Aside from that though, the battles were great. It was almost information overload once the headquarters is introduced, although it doesn't take long to understand and get into it.   All in all, the graphics, art style, story, squad-building tactical fun is like nothing I've ever played before. After 40 hours I was sad to see the story end although it did so with Ghibli delight. Overall I have no difficulty recommending this game. 9/10.",

            "review_text": "What happens when you combine the RPG elements of a turn-based strategy game with the action of a 3rd person shooter? A completely new genre and, hopefully, the future of tactical role-playing games. Valkyria Chronicles (as far as I know) is the first game to ever try this formula and thankfully, it was done right.  I really like this game and have tons of reasons of why you should buy it to back it up but before that let's get my main issues with the game out of the way. The ranking system doesn't take in account if you killed enemies or if you allowed any of your units to fall in battle, the ranking system ONLY takes into account how many turns you took to finish a mission which leads me to another problem, Scouts. They usually are your main units because you don't really need any other units! Why would you spend your time moving around all the other classes if you can just combine orders and scouts so they can basically do all the jobs of all the other classes? You can still achieve As without the so called 'scout runs' but still... it seems a little broken (Thankfully I was able to avoid this by only trying to use 2 scouts per mission and little to no orders which made the game more fun and challenging). *You can still use scout runs to farm money and exp in the skirmishes but that's alright  -STORY In the year 1935, a huge war (EW2) takes place in the continent of Europa. The Empire tries to take on the continent in an effort to get more Ragnite for their country (basically a mineral which is used for EVERYTHING) but the Federation fights back. In the middle of both countries is located a thrid neutral country, Gallia. When the Empire decides to attack Gallia, the story of how a small country can beat a super-power begins...  You play as Welking Gunther, the son of the hero of the EW1, as he guides Squad 7 in an attempt to push the Imperials out of Gallia. In your journey you're accompanied by fellow aspiring baker Alicia Melchiott, former bar singer Brigitte 'Rosie' Stark, veggie maniac Largo Potter, genius engineering prodigy (not to mention your sister) Isara Gunther, and a bunch of other colorful characters that make up your squad.  The characters are all unique and feel different (with some cliches here and there), the plot is enough to keep you entertained but doesn't really stand out, the game deals with theme like racism and life admist war, but what really makes all of this great is the way the story is told.  -GAMEPLAY At first, the game looks like your typical strategy game (Fire Emblem, Advanced Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc...) you're showned a map where you have certain objectives and you can see the location of your units and SOME of your enemies. Once you choose which unit to use with your 'CP' or Command Points is when the real fun takes place. You are suddenly thrown into a third person perspective of the unit you chose where you're allowed to move around, crouch and take cover, attack enemy units, heal yourself or your teammates, save downed units, etc... How much you can do depends on how you spend your 'AP' or Action Points which is represented by a gauge which deplets as you move. Aside from keeping watch of your AP, you also have to watch out for enemy fire which will go for as long as you are in third person perspective. Finally each unit is different depending on which class you are (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, or Sniper) and to further differ each unit from one another each character has their own Potentials which trigger based on different criteria during the battle. I know it sounds REALLY complicated but to sum it up, the game is fun, unique and not really that hard to catch on once you get used to it.  -SOUND The soundtrack is great and always manages to fit the mood. The game is has full voice-acting for each and every character and really DO give a personality to each squad member or enemy. A MAJOR + is the inclusion of both Japanese and English voice acting but as far as I know, this game has GOOD english voice acting unlike most JRPGs or Japanese games in genral.  -GRAPHICS &amp; PRESENTATION Graphics are BEAUTIFUL and look rather unique with its oil-painting, anime like look. The game's hub world (if it can be called that) is divided in a story/picture book menu which divides the game in different sections and menus which, again, is really unique and looks nice.  In conclusion, BUY THIS GAME!!! Even at the full price of $20 this game is absolutely worth it!!! The game offers 60+ in the normal campaign, not to mention this version includes all 4 previously released DLCs. It has the option for a new game + and also every mission you're given a score based on performance, so you can replay missions and aim for the A rank in all 4 difficulties if that's your thing. Basically, it's cheap, unique, fun, engaging and has tons of replayability :)  Oh and I almost forgot, this game freaking has VYSE, AIKA, and FINA from SKIES OF ARCADIA!!!!! That already makes it a must buy for everyone on Steam :O  *On a side note, I did encountered some problems: -The game ocasionally crashed (recurring examples include: after the first time you visit the Headquarters, and after the results screen in both missions of Chapter 5: The Kloden Wildwood and Report 6: What Lies Beyond Hate) I have heard this happened to many others too, hope it gets fixed. -Characters suddenly glitching out of the map. They literally fall to a bottomless pit of black screen that can only be fixed by loading a previous save file. This mostly happened after climbing up stairs. Hope it gets fixed soon too.",

It used a custom engine for the time which blended a manga art style with a 3D engine. The engine was scaled down for the sequels which released for the PSP. This however, is the best version of it, the full version.  Valkyria Chronicles has a setting in a WWII technology world. However with one distinct difference, a lack of airpower. In a way Valkyria is a blending of ideas from WWI, WWII, and Napoleonic wars. Everything is centered around Ragnite. A miracle mineral used to both power vehicles and heal troops.  Mixed into this world are those descended from an ancient race who could manipulate Ragnite. Where the Valkyria name comes from. Imagine super soldiers with energy cannons that can decimate everything.  This all comes to pass in the nation of Gallia which holds the largest stockpile of Ragnite but is neutral to world affairs. Others want it, then are willing to do anything to capture it. There is a lot of political wrangling in the background of the story. But also at the root of it is many very dark undertones of hatred of Darcsens, Gallian natives who are heavily stereotyped in Gallian society.  There is common anime tropes at times but the story is extremely solid. Created by members of Sega's famed Overworks team. Those that missed the Dreamcast golden age, now is the time to see what Overworks was capable of.   Sega even did an anime based on this game, which is in some ways better. The ending of the anime is better than the game, makes more sense, but both are fantastic. Skies of Arcadia (The greatest Overworks title ever made) fans will even get a treat with cameos from Vyse, Aika, and Fina as all of their characters were snuck into this.   This is the kind of game Sega should be delivering to the PC crowd on a regular basis. I couldn't hold back from purchase the moment it was announced. My PS3 may never boot up again and I certainly want to see more titles like this making it to PC.   If you don't buy it for PC, buy it for PS3. I honestly bought a PS3 just to play this game and I didn't regret it one bit.",

Best for every money!'  But as a gamer with tendency to realism and perfectionism... while playing I was confused so many times trying to get those achievements... so I'm not feeling the game concept was right. In fact, there was so many furious 'Why?!!' and 'Oh, really?!' while I was getting a perfect from this game, so my final count drops to 7/10.  Buy it, if you're a fan of the games in total, or if you're deep into all the 'J' stuff. The game will perfectly suits in your collection. And DON'T buy Valkyria Chronicles, if you can't stand anime stuff for long and want all the achievements. Or if you want a realistic story about war. Or good tactics game. Because there, to get 'A' ('SS') rating, you need to forget about good strategies like move carefully, stay covered, flanking enemies and so on. To get 'A' rating you need to pick one scout and run like hell on enemies positions, dodging tons of bullets.  One of the most intriguing features at the start of the game as unique bio's on every soldier in your squad, meaning different behavior at the battlefield... quickly becomes a burden, because almost everybody are broken in some way. That means, you cannot collect a dream team, you need to pick different people for every mission, even for different terrains, and hey! it is not so easy, because of the way the management in the game organized. To speak of controls in the general... well, optimization from console to the PC went not too bad, but controls, and more of all, use of the mouse... can be a real pain. Especially while driving a tank (another potentially great feature went really bad on PC).  Well, like I already said, game's a facinating - for anime fans, and may be even dull for those who aren't. Tread carefully!",

            "review_text": "Gameplay: great. It's not very tactical at times and the AI is really bad (either scripted to stay in place or run to a pre-defined destination), but the unique mixture of third person-perspective action and turn-based strategy somehow works very well, making the game approachable for the fans of both genres. Missions are varied and don't let the player get bored by repetitive actions. The game is very enticing and it's too easy to suddenly realize that it's 2 AM now and you have spent half of the night playing.  Story: characters are cliche and plot is cliche as well. Whoever wrote them though made a very good use of those cliches though, making the characters very likeable and easy to get attached to. Sure, it's not the greatest piece of fiction world has ever seen, but it works. If you're a teenager and this is your first jRPG, you will probably love it.  Graphics: stylized to look like hand-drawn Japanese animation. If that's not your thing, you may have a problem, but otherwise it's clear and easy on the eyes. The port to PC was done very well so framerate is smooth. As a side note, character design was taken care of by a rather well-known hentai artist and, surprisingly, did not result in tons of fanservice but rather gave the game a no-nonsense war fiction feel.  Sound: I'm obviously biased here as the music was done by my favourite VGM composer, Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy XII among others). I will spare you from singing praises, just listen to the battle tracks which he excels at. Voice acting is very competent in Japanese version and average in English, where it's hit or miss. If you don't mind a liberal translation, Japanese voices and English subtitles are probably the best way in this case.  Summary: definitely worth buying and playing. This kind of game is what you would expect to see on handheld consoles, which is all the more reason to try one when it finally got a PC version. Score: 9/10",

            "review_text": "Really good port of a really good game.   Got this game when i got my PS3. I ignored it for about a year because it didnt really interest me, but once I started playing i knew i was missing out. It puts a nice twist on tactics based games. Once you select a unit, instead of moving them on the overhead map and attacking, you actually control the character in 3rd person view and can interact with the environment. When you are in the stage enemies can attack you instead of standing there letting you run past. If you are familiar with xcom the attacking system is a little different. Instead of rolling the dice you have a crosshair that you can move to different parts of the body. On human troops headshots do extream damage and on tanks they have radiators, which allows light infantry units to damage to damage the tank.  The story is eh, but the artstyle is great. Every character has personalitys or 'Potentials' that can make or break a battle. Some units gets a defence boost when under fire, while one outright refuses to attack due to being a pacifist. If units are next to each other, there is a chance they will shoot with you when you fire, allows you to make some devastating combo attacks.  Difficulty wise, it can be a roller coaster. On chapter 7 for example, you fight a very difficult and rather long mission, while chapter 6 and 8 can be rather easy, though the difficulty kinda levels out near the end of the game. Despite this, the game requires little to no grinding, which is a plus in my book. You can go the entire game without beating a single skirmish or extra mission.  Once you beat the game you can start again in New Game+, which allows you to keep all levels and equipment, which means you can absolutly destroy the missions you once had trouble with, and along with that, you unlock an extra difficulty on skirmishes.  All in all, its a great game. Is it for everyone? Of course not, its a strategy game with an anime-esq artstyle.",

            "review_text": "As a person that does not watch anime or has never played any Japanese RPGs, this game struck me as an awesome looking WW2 game with a Japanese twist. I was rather sceptical about purchasing it because I did not want it to be like the horrendous Girls und Panzer anime based on WW2 and World of Tanks. However, I can honestly say this game is AWESOME!  It ticks so much boxes in all the right places. The graphics has a nice cartoony yet pretty feel to it, gameplay is smooth and stable, and the story (which people have criticized) is actually pretty good!  The story is simple. In an alternate planet, in the continent of Europa (which is obviously Europe) consists of two superpowers, the autocratic Empire and the Atlantic Federation. After a resource known as Ragnite (which powers everything) goes scarce, the Empire invades the neighbouring peaceful nation of Gallia to take their Ragnite reserves.  The story is viewed from the perspective of Welkin, a nature-loving nerd who is caught up in the Empire's invasion of Gallia. There, he meets Alicia, a baker who took up arms to defend her town from the Empire long enough for its citizens to evacuate. The story telling in this game is sublime, and I found myself sucked straight into it after the first 10 minutes.   After some mumbo jumbo Alicia and Welkin are drafted into the Gallian Army. This is where the game properly begins. For those who've played Xcom: Enemy Unknown, this is exactly like it. You have your HUB where you can recruit and train soldiers for your squad. There are a lot of different squad members you can choose, and each one has different voices and their own stories which I find pretty awesome. There are some characters you get attached to, like the homosexual Lancer named Jann (who is voiced by the same guy who voiced Jake in Adventure Time.) There is also a R&amp;D department where you can buy upgrades for your weapons and tanks.   That's the story out of the way. Basically, this is the anime version of Xcom but with WW2 themes. Each round you can choose where to position who (there are five classes of units) and battle. To move a unit, you have to use one Command Point. Unlike Xcom, upon selecting a unit to move, you take full control of them from a third person perspective, allowing you to run around, explore the map and fire at the enemies at your will. This is the same with tanks.  As the game progresses, the challenge increases.   However, there are many moments where you will just think 'WHAT THE HELL KIND OF BS IS THAT!' This game is brutal when it comes to the missions. You've made so much progress in a mission, and then you fail all because of an absolutely STUPID trickshot that blows up the Edelweiss. *cough cough GIANT OP TANK cough cough* I've had many rage moments where I just slam on my keyboard in anger and alt+F4 the game in rage. Pretty much every mission was like that. Have one or two game overs that end in rage, and then have a stunning victory. Be prepared for it.  On that note, one of the things that I did not find enjoyable is that the game can become extremely difficult (such as the second mission.) These particular missions you have no choice but to use the method the game expects you to, not using your own strategy against the enemy. I found this a real problem in an otherwise perfect game. Especially with boss battles (I hate the boss fights in this game.)   I really wish that one was able to choose their own strategy and use it against the enemy. While some missions do present this ability where there are multiple ways of winning (be it spamming scouts and doing a hard/fast approach, or go in guns blazing with the Edelweiss and a buttload of Lancers and shock troopers) it still isn't perfect. Due to the lack of variation in enemy types, and the linearity of the levels, there isn't a whole lot of Supreme Commander stye strategy going on here. Not to mention that the A.I can be a bit too smart sometimes. There is also a grading system that grades you on how well you beat the mission. However to attain a perfect score you must 100% of the time do the super scout approach.   This is a good game. If you like turn-based strategy games like Xcom, this is the game for you. If you're a casual player (which is highly unlikely since Xcom isn't a casual game,) then don't go for it, and watch the anime (read below) instead.  EDIT: I discovered the existance of a 'Valkyria Chronicles anime' that is practically scene by scene anime of the game but with some minor story differences. It's not brilliant, but it's a hell of a lot better than *shudders* Girls und Panzer.  EXTRA REVIEW!: Valkyria Chronicles Anime (SPOILERS AHEAD)  At the time of this review I am seven episodes in, and there is not much I can say really except for the differences in character for some people, namely um... ALICIA, WELKIN AND FALDIO! To add more drama into the show the makers added some sort of love triangle, so now Alicia doesn't know if she wants the W or the F. Speaking of Alicia, she's a total B*TCH in the anime. In the game, she's very caring and you can see she has a thing for Welkin from the start. In the anime however, she constantly yells at him, calling him a 'weirdo.' Well, you kinda would agree with her because Welkin is really weird in the anime, he constantly seems really oblivious to the situation around him, never serious as if he has a cloud in his head instead of a brain. I love the scene where Irene threatens to tell everyone he tried to ♥♥♥♥ her if he doesn't give her an interview and he starts laughing innocently as if she just told a funny joke.  Faldio acts like a charismatic lady's man, but the way the writers wrote him makes him look like a generic 'jock.' He automatically starts gunning for Alicia and tries to win her heart by doing stupid things, such as telling everybody they saw each other naked (Alicia caught him shirtless and flipped her sh*t, and Faldio snuck up on her putting up her washing on a clothes line and picked up some of her underwear, and again she flipped her sh*t.) and then used Greek history to compare them to Aphrodite and Ares.  The other characters are pretty much the same. Jann is still the awesome homosexual guy (except that he isn't voiced by John DiMaggio. Seriously, they should have made him deliver his lines in Japanese.) There are also some other characters such as Faldio's sargeant, but they aren't really that memorable. Also, they made Maximillian seem like such a boring villain. In the game he sees everything with a hint of boredom, and isn't afraid of showing his wrath when needed. In the anime, he's bored pretty much all of the time.   That's really all I have to say about the anime. If you're a big fan of VC, then have a go at watching it. I think it has remained loyal to the essence of the game, but does attempt to deviate (which is not a bad thing!) They tried their best.",

It's a relatively light hearted war story with a focus on the main characters. The cell-shaded graphics stand the test of time and PC optimization is solid. I loved this game to bits and so glad Sega brought it over to PC. Also there are waifus.    Longer Version Optimization  Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 port, and they did an great job with the mouse and keyboard transition. The game supports higher resolution and fps than the original, although cutscenes are still PS3 quality. The default mouse sensitivity is a bit low for my tastes, so you might want to bump it up to 100 in configurations. No crashes on my end  Gameplay  Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy-third person shooter hybrid. Think a fusion of XCOM and Fire Emblem. In the game the player are given command points (CP) for each turn in a overview map. Moving a unit takes up CP and will turn the game into a 3rd person shooter. In 3rd person the characters are given an action points (AP) bar, which depletes with each step a character makes.   The objectives for missions vary, but most of the time it requires capturing a enemy base, and player is encouraged with more XP and money to win with fewer turns. Permadeath is in place for any non-essential characters, so protect your waifus/husbando. I should mention that you have a couple of turns to tag fallen waifus before permadeath occurs.   Your soldiers are all given a background and perks unique to their background. The leveling and upgrade tree are class dependent so no need to train individuals. Note: There is a almost gamebreaking strategy by the end of game, but there is a rather large difficultly spike in the middle story.  Story  The game is set in a mixture of WWI and WW2, and your fighting for a neutral country caught in up in a larger conflict. Some of the stories and character rely on anime tropes, so if you absolutely hate that stuff you probably won't like the game. Ultimately the game is more about the characters and their reactions to the war than the actual conflict itself. I played on the PS3 and thought it was a humanistic stories slewn with optimism for a better future. By the end of the game I also connected with at least a few of the characters. (I'm being vague to prevent spoilers) This is also one of the few games that touch on racism in a mature way, so major props.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: This is a must have if you're looking for a deep single player experience with an excellent fleshed out story.  what is this?: Valkyria Chronicles is a single-player turn based strategy game that works much in the same way other games do in their genre but with a few twists. Think X-Com but with real characters. It's set in a WWII-esque setting which takes many ques from history in the 2nd World War and other conflicts, any keen history buff can see where the various influences for nations,weapons, vehicles and events come from.   Pros:  *Great storyline, I enjoyed it and I still have a ways to go until i'm finished. (i've watched the anime for this which is mostly similar).  *great combat mechanics, the combat works well and its possible for your squadmates to do well, troops are divided into 4 classes each with their own strengths and weaknesses and require close teamwork in order to be at maximum effectiveness.   *traits and potentials: Each soldier is different, they all have their own stories and personal quirks that make their way into how they perform on the field. For example some soldiers hate each other and their effectiveness can wax and wane based on who's fighting with them, or their preference for a certain environment can help them or hinder them.  *Various RPG elements such as leveling characters, traits and weapons (with them having new added effects).  Cons:  *Difficulty scales up quickly which requires you to at times grind skirmishes.  *Tank controls can be incredibly annoying and has more then once lost me a battle due to how it was ported. However this could just be my own issue.  *Certain plot points can be unsettling with there being frequent references to Racism (against a group known as Darcsens, essentially made to represent the Jewish and other minorities). However for a first serious depiction of the Holocaust and discrimination put on minorities, not only by the antagonists but also the protagonists too makes it somewhat of an eye-opener to the attitudes held across the world at this time.   special notes: This game, which came before the anime differs greatly at times with the Anime, the anime features a lot more drama and added or removed plot points, even going as far as inventing new relationships that did not exist. I personally prefer the game in terms of plot (it all feels warmer and friendlier then the Anime). In terms of plot the Game is (in my opinion) better.",

Even brings me back to my MGS PW or PO fix... or even to the Pokemon days... It's great. Far as I can tell its an alt universe German invasion of France with no luftwafelles. It's even got the little occultish stuff going on. Some romance, idk, haven't really been trying to beast through the story. It's a game that makes XP farming fun, very tactical. The video shows no game play, but it's like a turn based rpg war game done in semi realistic but kid friendly anime art(even though there is people dying all over the place.) Idk, it plays like metal gear acid, just a little less complicated, and a little more kriegspeil. It's really fun, and I am compelled by the story. I'm not sure, but I feel like this game was released on PSP for some reason. It's a lot like final fantasy tactics except it's sorta simplified and complexified in different ways. Just youtube a game play. There are some annoyances. Gamepad design is weird and in menu is oversensitive, but aiming a weapon, it's literally goes the opposite damn way. No it's not an inverse, idk why they did it, it's to allow for more human error. Xcom kinda except you do a lot of the aiming. It's really great tho. Also, another thing thats really kinda annoying... Well, they have their cutscenes which are great, but they have these sub scenes that are just so annoying cause you have to press a button every line. Even when someone says '...' Really kinda annoying buuut I'm looking past it.",

            "review_text": "Valkyria Chronicles is a charming game originally deployed on the PS3 6 years ago.   The game is based on a fictive version of a 2nd world war era Europe. 2 large ntions / alliances of nations dukes it out in an attempt to control a multipurpose ressourse, the ragnite, that has become scarcier. Stuck in between the two major powers, a small independant nation, names Gallia, struggles to maintain its neutrality until one of the major powers, the eastern empire, turns its gaze upon the large ragnite reserves it posseses. It is now up to a small band of civilians of all origins enroled into the millitia to defend the contry and push back the eastern invaders. The player controls squad 7 of the militia. The game is a strategy role playing game with several unique twist to its game mechanics:  The missions rewards the players who manages to reach the final objective in the shortest delays, encouraging risky tactics over attrition tactics. A mission will rank the player based on the number of turns it takes to accomplish the main objective. Each ranks gives a different amounth of xp and cash and the difference between each ranks can be very noticeable. The difference in gain from a Rank A reward and a B rank rewards can make killing all units more of a hinderance than anything, as they'll never fill the gap of xp between the 2 fo example.  Each turns are made up of a player phase, where the player gets to use his command points as he fits, and then, the enemy phase who does the same. The player don't need to play all his units in a turn, nor is he limited to use each units once. Indeed, he can active multiple times the same units over the course of his phase, but each extra time the character is activated, the movement points are reduced, causing a gradually more limited movement range. Furthermore, several weapons and actions have a limited amonth of use per phase and usually regenerates of only one use per turns (exemple, sniper rifles can shoot only 3 bullets, and only recovers 1 bullet per turns, so if the player shot three times this turn, the next turn he will only have one shot).   Keep in mind however, that command points are limited, and some other things uses command points. For instance, tanks consume 2 points of commands and the player can also use 'orders' which gives a boost to either a single unit or entire squads or can allow for some special actions like sniper support or instant evacs for different costs depending on the specific order.  An important difference in gamplay mechanics is that whenever you select a unit, you fall in a 3rd person perspective and control the character directly. I can make 1 action (shoot, heal, repair, throw grenade) and can move as long as your movement gauge has some points in it. Some skills may trigger at any time during the activation, giving buffs or debuffs on your character's actions, thus influencing the results of the actions.   While in action mode, the character player by the character is subject to counter fires by all tanks, scout, shocktrooper and engineer units in firing range, as such, the player cannot just waltz in enemy lines unattended. Also, when the player attacks any of the stated classes but fails to kill them, they can make a single counter attack, making the management of a unit's HP primodial in the action phase. But what is true for the player, is also true for the enemy. A good positionning of the player's units can make a formidable line of defence. A bad positionning can lead to death however, so it is recommended to end each character's final turn in hiding or in cover, in order to improve their chances of survival.  Each characters comes with 3 or 4 personality traits who can be beneficial (like hard worker which allows a second action) or hindering (like pollen allergy which generat an hp loss whenever your character walks in the grass) and each characters have their own unique combination of those. Furthermoe, each characters have access to up to 4 benefical potentials based on their class, giving even more variety in each units.  There is perma death in this game for every sub characters. While story characters are immune to this, they become unavailable for the rest of the mission. This occurs when a character is reduced to 0 hp and he is either left ther for three turns unattended, or that the enemy walks up to him first. In order to avoid this, the player needs to either send a unit next to the downed man or spend some command points and use the appropriate order to force an evac of the unit without risking another unite for the job.  Another twist is that the xp earned in a fight is considered a squad exp rather than an individual one, like most games of the genre. This exp can then be spent on leveling up classes as the player wishes it. When a class is leveled, all characters of that class are leveled along with it, even those not currently part of you selected squad. This design choice allows the player to try out different characters without suffering the drawback of a character underleveled compared to the current state of the game.  The visuals of the game stands up very well despite being 6 years old. The graphics juggle between anime style and watercolor painting giving it a unique artstyle that can stand the test of time. Each environnement are well depicted and their atmosphere well expressed. Details go as far as giving a unique face to each of your prospect squand members, giving them a identity and a personality despite not being integral part of the story. Even some Onomatopoeia can be see on screen whenever a tank moves, a gun shoots or some other interesting sounds occurs while in slide shows during story sequences, giving the feeling to read a comic book.  The menus and between mission events are all integrated in a book style interface, as if all you experience in the game is red through scriptures and images of the book, this way of navigating through the menu allows the player to remain immersed in the game's universe even though you are in the meta management of your squad. I found it charming and pretty unique in its own right.  Sound is another part of the game where lots of love was poured into. The original sound track is one of the bestI listened to in the industry, channeling through strong emotions whenever it was needed. Likewise, the voice acting / dubbing is pretty good, and the player can even choose between Japanese or English voice over, both being of very good quality.  In short, it is a beautiful game full with unique mechanics and personality that deserves to be tried out. My game on the ps3 lasted for a good 40+ hours and I stilll had the dlc to finish. The PC port, when played with a game controller, is very much like the PS3 version, with generally better FPS. I did encounter some major slow downs shortly after some in missions events triggered while in 3rd person mode, but they are few and far in betwee and usually don't last long.  I have been preaching the virtues of this game for 6 years now, and those who decided to give it a try, loved it. The game was cursed by near inexistant marketting on a very prolific gaming year and passed mostly unnoticed by gamers of the time. Sega is now giving the francise a second chance and I can only hope that, this time, the game will get the recognition it deserves :D",

            "review_text": "GAMEPLAY: If you're a fan of turn based tactics, Valkyria Chronicles is right down your alley. The combat is a mix between multiple genres, where you look at a map of the level enviornment, with icons placed to represent units and objectives. Selecting a unit brings you down on to the battlefield, where you control them using a limited pool of AP (think stamina). Enemies aren't docile in this game, and if you're within a unit's range they'll defensively fire at you. This intercepting fire can be absolutely lethal, and forces you to think your tactics through in a way unlike most turn based games. In addition to commanding your units, you can also issue orders, which are effectively buffs (Caution is an especially useful one, which lowers the damage of the afformentioned intercepting fire). You also don't have to move each character once and end your turn, you move units from a pool of CP, with regular units costing one point, tanks two, and orders are variable but usually between one and three. You can also save your unused CP up to a maximum of twenty points.   The AI tends to be fairly intelligent for the most part, using cover and any special abilities they may have. They don't aim for the head, but the battles would be absolute curbstomps on their part otherwise. Sometimes they make silly mistakes, but they overall function properly.  One negative thing about the game is that the grading system for each stage rewards taking stupid risks and completing the objectives as fast as possible as opposed to a more tactical and careful method. This is good for speedrunners, but not so great for people fond of taking things nice and slow, as the diminished rewards of a lower score could serve to force you to grind in the skirmishes to keep up. Also, while usually fair, the game does have a couple massive difficulty spikes, especially when you have to fight a massive tank known as the Batomys (seriously, good luck getting through that without a walkthrough).   STORY: The story is satisfying, but it isn't anything to heap praise upon. You play as Welkin Gunther, and alongside your newly met friend Alicia and Darcsen sister Isara, you join the Gallian Militia. Two major powers, the Federation and Empire are at war with each other over the acquistion of a power source known as ragnite. Your little country of Gallia happens to be sitting on a lot of that precious stuff, so one of those factions (the evil sounding one), decides to invade your country. With superior numbers, technology, and overall everything, the country of Gallia is forced to start universal conscription. You, Welkin Gunther, are put in charge of the milita's Squad 7.  Each of the many characters you can recruit for your squad is their own, with a detailed backstory, full voice acting, and various potentials which can help and hinder in battle. Most of your squadmates are teenagers, as this is a JAPANESE game, and such is to be expected. A permadeath aspect of the game helps to raise the stakes, much like Nintendo's Fire Emblem.  The story does a good job of tackling the horrors of war, but it has it's flaws. SPOILERS ABOUND IN THIS PARAGRAPH BTW THIS WAS YOUR WARNING KTHNXBYE. The romantic relationship between Welkin and Alicia seems to be a bit forced, and doesn't seem to add much to the story. In addition, Alicia as a whole seems like a major Mary Sue. She's pretty, everybody likes her, she's the most powerful scout available, she's smart, a good cook, and is a Valkyur (an immensely powerful being) for some reason, and just wants to be normal. This could easily just be me, though.  SPOILER IS OVER URWELCOME. Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is worth picking up. If you don't like turn based combat, or have a strong aversion to anime, you should probably avoid it, but you also probably figured that out by now. By the way, one of the units totally looks like Gordon Freeman. If you'll play it you'll find out who I mean.",

There are many cutscenes which may become tedious for some players who like to jump into only the action but I prefer to know at least who I'm fighting with and what I'm fighting for. My only dislike is the fact that the AI in the game won't really ever outsmart you, but you could be overrun by troops that are far too out of your league, and that feels to me like a 'bad loss' where a good loss is when you lost because of a failure to be as strategic as possible with your actions and a bad loss is one where you could replay the mission as many times as you wanted and still die, even then, the challenge missions (which I'm probably not supposed to do until a higher level because they clearly outclass me) can be won with decent strategies and some guile. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good, fun, story-based game, or who likes strategy games with a slightly easier learning curve to them.",

I'm about 10 hours in now and really enjoying it - the little story episodes are pretty good (once I'd got past the cheesy anime stuff - I'm not much of an anime fan) and the characters are built up as the story progresses and they're all fairly interesting and well written.  The mechanics of the game are great - a turn based strategy like XCOM but with real-time elements which makes it far more interesting and adds to the action. Accidentally running out in front of enemy units and getting mowed down is punishing you for not checking if it was clear first. The classes all have their interesting traits but I found that generally the scout/shocktrooper were generally the most useful.  There are a couple of annoying things about the game though - it's stable and looks great on PC but very little thought went into using a keyboard/mouse - I ended up using the keyboard a lot for operating menus which seemed fairly dumb. Also, controlling the tank can be incredibly frustrating at times resulting in wasted AP/CP...I'm not sure if it's a keyboard/mouse conflict but you can end up using up all your AP turning in the wrong direction.  Overally, I was very impressed with it and look forward to finishing it!",

            "review_text": "I recently bought the game a few days ago at 25% off for the christmas sale and i have to say it has been my best buy all year. Already i have logged a great amount of hours playing.  First I want to mention that this is a console port so if you are like me playing on a laptop and you get slowdowns just change the resolution down a bit, for me 1280x720 fixed it. Others say that changing the fps limit to 30 will fix it aswell.  Yes it's a long review i really like this game and wanted to give out my opinion on alot of the topics.  Story:  [+] I am 3/4's way through the game and i have to say the story has been fantastic there has been a great deal of character development from both the main protagonist and the antagonist. It is your classic world war plot with a sub-romance but it pulls it off in a very unique way and every chapter introduces a great deal of information about everything mentioned in the game. For those of you like me that don't mind looking in the glossary or info tabs for more information about all the events, characters, places, and weapons. It does a great job of adding plenty of backstory. *This version of the game includes all the DLC bounus missions and content. *playing battles with extra characters unlocks backstory about them - giving you information on why they have the traits they do. *Story answers questions after it presents them or soon after  [-]  *It is a bit unfortunate that it seems a bit rushed at times (there are a few moments where something happened and some of the characters just gloss over it very fast.),  *the chapters can be extremely short especially with most of the beginning chapters just including 1 battle with a few short cutscenes.  *You may not get some references the characters make in the dialouge if you do not check the glossary on the events that happened in the past. *Some of the characters can be forgettable  Gameplay:  The gameplay is a very unique style which i have to say i love. If you have played X-Com you will notice some similarities. It is a turn-based top down 3rd person tactical shooter 'whew'. You start off in the top down command screen where you use your 'CP' given to you each turn to move your units on the battle field. Once you select a unit you go into third person where you are able to move around as much as their stamina bar will let you then you can do an action ie: shoot, heal ect... The game also allows you to choose what upgrades you want for your tank/weapons If you want a accurate sniper you can make it, then you can make a more powerful one and then equip them to different people in your squad for certain fights.  [+]  *The game is very challenging. There is no difficulty setting for the story missions (atleast for the first playthrough it does not seem to give you a choice.)  *the skirmish battles allow for multiple difficulty choices.  *Every mission will be throwing you into a different scenario forcing you to adjust your strategies on the fly and make quick decisions to complete the given objective.  *some maps may seem small but the use of cover and some nicely placed invisible walls make the maps seem 10X bigger than they actually are.  *The game allows you to have 20 uniquely voice acted characters in your squad. at anytime you can swap them out for different characters who become unlocked as the game progresses. In the battles that i am at i have only been allowed a max of 10 soldiers on the field at a time. [i will update if this changes] *Unique playable characters, with their own personalities and voice acting. *The ability to lose characters forever. (yes your characters can die in battle leaving you to actually care more for the extra guys and gals than you normally would) *ability to save in battles (thank you! lol) *give squad members different weapons so they all don't just have the best accuracy gun should you choose to upgrade it. *Class leveling system - You level by classes not by individual so you don't have to worry about not taking alicia in every battle and think she will fall behind.  [-]  *Some of the gunfights can come down to luck or the old RNG, you can be right behind someone and aim for his head but miss Completely only to leave you facepalming and your character getting downed the next turn lol. *No present diffculty option for the story missions. *some smaller map design limits the posibilities of how to tackle a certain situation. *Tank's seem to dominate really easily so they overload the enemy with tank busters  Graphics/bugs: As it is a Ps3 port i was expecting it to not be in a high quality but i was pleasantly suprised. they have updated the PC version to allow support for beyond 1080p but for me and some others higher resolutions seem to cause problems without limited the frames to 60.  [+] *I love the art style in the game, it is very vibrant and colorful *Runs great with no performance issues whatsoever *All enviroments are very detailed and definetly give off the worn battlefield feel *Characters are visually detailed and animated facial expressions and unqiue movements and animations on the field.  [-] *a strange border style to give it more of a picturesque feel. *30 fps on certain resolutions may be noticable to some. *game will crash often if you alt tab during a skirmish   Language?/Voice: This release is in english but it also comes with a japanese voice option. Unfortunatly it seems that the subtitles in the japanese version use the same ones as if you left subtitles on in the English dub. Now for us who can understand a bit of the Japanese language it seems that what they are saying and what the words at the bottom display do not always match. So if you are an wanting to hear the original script or a direct translation you may be better off finding a fan made translation/patch. I am playing the game with the english voices and i have to point out that they did a fantastic job setting the tone for each character. I even enjoy the lines given to the characters you can recruit into your squad, you can tell what kind of person they are just by how they sound.  Sound/OST: From what i have heard in the game the music is great! the compostition Hitoshi Sakimoto put together fits the mood for almost every scene. he said that it took him a total of eight months to complete it and what time well spent. i can only say that the ost is definitely one i will be looking to pick up in the future. Now for the sounds.  [+]  *The game adds visuals to sounds... what i mean is that if you see a tank moving the game will add a 'Vvrrrmm' or 'rumble rumble' next to it in a anime'ish style which adds alot to the art style. the same can be said for any other sounds like an explosion might have a big 'BLAM!' come out of the ground which is nothing less than satisfying.  *I'm not a gun expert in anyway but they sound good enough to me im not going to complain if they sound fake or hold it against them the sounds they use fit the art style and serious tone, it adds a certain charm to the game.  [-] *Some of the voice acting for the English dub is out of synch with the characters facial animations. This can be normal with translated game but in this one it can be very noticable.  Replayability: As this is a linear game i am a bit worried about how i would enjoy this game on the second time around so far the majority of the 'side quest if you can call it that' is just a skirmish battles, it is very 'this is what you have to do now do it'.  The extra characters that you choose for your squad at start are random. my friend had bought the game and i told him he should get a person named Lynn but he did not have her or many of the ones i started with. he had some characters that i had just unlocked in recent missions.  I may update with more once i start my second playthrough or complete the game.  Overall rating: 9/10",

The best part about this is: The Port is actually great for one, and it does come with all DLC released on the PS3 Version for Free, so that is a major plus, because the DLC is also rather awesome. PC Controls are nice, but I mostly prefer to use a controller because I'm so much more used to it for this game. Music is still as awesome as ever. Graphics have aged a bit, but they're still somewhat beautiful. Story is one of the best I've ever seen in an RPG - No - Any Game ever IMHO, which is why I do praise it so highly.

The storyline is familiar (due to the obvious parallels to WWII) but still original and intensely rewarding.  This was one of my favorite games on PS3 and the PC version is just as good and a fantastic bargain. Though the graphics don't really benefit from higher resolution they are still fantastic in style and presentation.",

            "review_text": "Valkyria Chronicles is a somewhat typical S/TRPG (strategy/tactical RPG) that's been wrapped in a beautiful artistic vision and unique gameplay persepctive. Most of the common elements of tactical RPGs are here. Take control of the units you've selected from your squad, place them within your starting area and using Command Points move them during your turn within their movement radius and take one action. Once all the command points have been spent the turn is passed to the AI who does all their moves and then again back to you tiill either the objective is completed or failure on your part.   There are 5 of classes in the game, Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer and Sniper. Also there is a tank(s) that you command as well as the different classes. Before each map you can choose what number soldiers from each class you take into the battlefield, some maps may require to load up on certain classes while forgoing a class entirely. Most of the classes are also able to choose between a couple of different weapons/load outs so you can either favour accuracy, damage or status effects. In addition to different classes and load outs there are also various orders to be given in battle (each order costs command points).  The best parts of the game to me were the Characters, level design and perspective. The third person perspective made for a unique experience in a tactical RPG rather than a typical grid. The Characters were great. The design to them as well as their lore all worked to drawyou in to the RPG experience. And lastly the level design. There was a good variety of levels, from cities, to forests and deserts. The levels also had different design elements and objective focuses to make each level interesting as well as replayable.  Some of the things that I was Neutral on was the Story and Leveling/progression system. After each victory you would be awarded a certain number of EXP points that could be spent on the training grounds to level up characters. Leveling up the characters didn't really result in traidtional RPG gains but would be used to unlock various class traits that would affect how that a character of that class would react to certain battlefield conditions. The leveling up seemed to have a minimal effect on things like HP (your starting HP won't be much different from end game HP). I did like that there was a variety of skirmish missions that could be done to grind for more experience or gold.   Some of the things I didn't like about the game were the Story, the interface and randomness. The story was okay, but was very typical of a JRPG. There was only one moment for me in the entire story that wasn't just generic JRPG storyline. Some of the big suprises were not very surprising and a lot of characters took very generic character paths, which is sad cause the I like the characters themselves, they had charm. As for the interface, there are a few things missing from the game that feel like it should be there. You can only save outside of missions, there is no ability to save mid mission and with some missions that are on the longer side, it can be a bit of a pain. As well you are shown how many shots it will take to kill an enemy (body vs head) but you are not given any percentages on if those shots will actually hit the target, so you are told that it will take 4 shots to kill an enemy but you are not told that you might only have a 50% chance of hitting the target. The AI could also be kind of infuriating because there is no option to skip the opponents turn animations (as far as I figured out anyways) and on some of the maps there is a lot of enemy actions to go through. Some of the Keyboard and Mouse controls can also be kind of wonky. Driving the tank(s) with Keyboard and mouse can be very very frustrating. One last thing I didn't really enjoy was that for the majority of the game you could load up on one character class with 2-3 other classes as support to power through the game.  Overall I felt that the game is very solid and definately worth the time to go through. The game can be found on sale pretty often these days for 5-10$ so it's pretty solid value as well.",

A strange mix of strategy and JRPG, Valkyria Chronicles will put you in charge of a platoon of soldiers. As you progress, you'll be able to recruit more, and will be forced to change your roster as locations shift.  It also has a unique homeage to older SEGA games like Skies of Arcadia by bringing in some recognizable characters into the frey. Though these characters aren't cannon per se, they do add a bit of unique flavor to the game. But even so, Valkyria Chronicles focuses on some interesting gameplay that makes each battle more diffucult than the last. Maybe your team is divided, maybe the enemies have more tanks. Who can say.  The units of your platoon act similarly to Rock Paper Scissors. Consisting of Lancers, Scouts, Assualt, Engineers, and Snipers. Scouts beat Assualt, Assualt beat Lancers, Lancers beat Tanks, and so on. The real odd ones out of this though is the Engineers and Snipers who act as supports mostly. The combinations of troopers is ever changing, and permadeath is a threat if you aren't careful.   Overall, I highly suggest Valkyria Chronicles. While it is an older game, it has held the test of time, and is still better than most things Ubisoft.",

This also includes all the DLC that was later released for the original PS3 title, which is a nice bonus.  I would say that the best experience comes from using a controller with the voice acting set to the original Japanese. This game is pretty damn Japanese, but it's bearable in part thanks to its sketchbook-style art and fun gameplay.  My one major gripe is that it is currently not possible to set any sort of anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering. It's not a big deal, but it would be nice to help smooth out the now high detail edges. Additionally, major cinematics are still from the pre-rendered PS3 version which is a bit jarring when transitioning between gameplay and watching something.

With a variety of troop types and other mechanisms in play, the selection of your squad can mean the difference between victory and defeat, so the game has you on your toes from the start - and it's as unfair to you as it is the AI!

I have never played this game before on PS3, but I have have always been a fan of JRPG type games. So when I found out that sega was going to port this game over to PC I got pretty excited because I had heard good things about this game when it came out for PS3.  I'm not very far into the game, but so far the game is showing great promise. I love the way the game is illustrated. Meaning that the animated scenes kind of look like a painting(in my opinion). Now the animated scenes are not what I would call 'current gen' graphics. I would assume this is because of the amount of work that would have to go into rerendering all of the animated scenes (and there are alot of them) would simply not be worth the effort. While these scenes look 'old' it simply does not bother me. The rest of the game looks very nice and has obviously been updated. I even went as far as to tinker with it a little bit with sweet fx mixed in to increase the saturation and the sharpness. Although with this game I didn't find myself wanting to turn up the saturation much because this game looks good in my opinion being somewhat 'washed out'  The controls for the game do take a little bit to get used to. It is only because the mouse cannot be used in the menu's. Once you get used to it though it really is not bad at all and honestly the way the game is set up it would actually be harder to get around the menu's with a mouse in my opinion. While you cannot use the mouse in the menu's it can be used while in combat which is huge, because at first I tried using the keyboard to aim and it was way to touchy to aim efficiently.   The story so far is interesting, but I cannot elaborate on it too muchon it, again because I am not that far into the game. It has the typical JRPG type feel and it is noticable in some of the dialogue, but in all honesty I have really missed it as of late being on the PC and not have owned a console since the PS2.  I would definitaly reccomend this game to anyone who likes JRPG's and turn based strategy type games!  Also, not sure if anyone else knows about it or recognizes her or not, but Aika from Skies of Arcadia is in it! When I found her in the recruit list I got pretty excited! Skies of Arcadia was and still is one of my favorite JRPG's of all time! Now i just need to wait and see Vyse!... I need to dig out my dreamcast and play that again.",

It also has optional, free save-scumming DLC but that might just be a personal issue.   The combat in VC, where you'll be spending most of your time, is a modern take on the old Final Fantasy Tactics, SRPG except with guns. It does away with the tile/grid based system and makes it into a more open style where your characters can go where they can, with distance restrictions based on class and instead of over head camera, it's now third person. Moving is about the only similar thing compared to traditional TRPGs, though. Usually, you can do two things during a characters turn, move and attack. In VC, though, you can move, attack, heal, hide in the environment (tall grass, behind sandbags, from view), and retreat from the battle to call new allies - all in the same turn. While attacking, you can a few things depending on class. While all classes can shoot/launch rockets (normal attack), other classes can use grenades or repair the tank. Engineers can even disarm mines while in movement. Detonating mines can also be done in movement and doesn't end turn, although it's not as effective as when an engineer does it. Healing also works similar to attack whereas you can't heal and then aim for someone. The interesting thing of note is, while moving, there is crossfire. No more will you or your enemy look upon your attacker and say, 'Hey, hit me'. Now they will say, 'if you don't kill me, I will kill you before you get here'. Every attack is also a counter attack so it's a very offensive based game with defensive in mind as well. It's the best of both worlds and the combined worlds are great!  There are 19 chapters (including prologue) and about 25 battles. There are also an infinite, although with pre-programmed AI, number of skirmishes to 'grind' exp and money for all those late game weapons and level required potentials and orders. Across those chapter and battles you meet a diverse cast of characters, some of which are distinguishable from each other and you stop the invading Soviets from invading Estonia (or Lithuania/Latvia).   Story wise, the scenes are short for those who just want to play and not watch but that also means a lot of things get rushed. The love story (as all RPGs have) feels slightly rushed. The game takes place over seven months and the story scenes take place over 22-24 days - if you get the special reports which are easy to get so I'm including them - over that time frame. I can't but wish a few more reports or other special scenes were including with the game so help to alleviate some of this but that could be because I'm all about story and character development which, while strong for the 12 or so main characters, is weak for the rest of the cast and must be earned through various battle strategies. It's a shame, too since a lot of the characters have interesting backstories and interactions with each other.   Visually, the game was built on an engine that as, so far only been used for the Valkyria Chronicles games that SEGA calls the CANVAS graphics engine. Its whole point seems to be to make everything look like a watercolored wonderland. Assuming you find war to be a wonderland, of course. The only odd/annoying thing about the engine is the border of everything is uncolored and is just an outline. It's not a major deal but it just seems unnecessary. Why not finish it? Characters look anime-ish so typical Japanese video game-ness here.   When it comes to music, it's wonderfully atmospheric. Many of the songs are orchestrated. Sadly, most of the songs aren't even heard. There's really only six or songs that get any sort of recollection out of me. Fortunately, the whole soundtrack is available in new game plus so give it a listen if you want to. Usually, I like to add official previews or downloads but I can't find any NA versions so here's an  RPGFan.com  review that's better than anything I can write on the OST as well as a few previews. Or, ya know, go to unofficial Youtube channels.    RPGFan  [www.rpgfan.com]   I picked-up Valkyria Chronicles because I wanted a game like Final Fantasy Tactics that wasn’t a game I've beaten 7 million times. I've tried a few and they ended-up being boring, mundane, mistakes. I currently have nearly 60 hours of playtime and I'm still not done with the new game plus and achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ing (although my drive died and my net sucks so 25gigs is painful). I finished the game in 50 or so hours before I went NG+, so there's a low price per hour. It's not FFT, it's not better, but it's doesn't have to be and no one should expect it. But it's good for the same reasons and then some.",

FOr those who enjoyed the Front Mission or Final Fantasy Tactics, VC should also be enjoyable.  My favorite aspect of this game is the graphics, which are meant to look as though they are drawn in colored pencil. The storyline is somewhat like a Miyazhaki movie, in the sense that it takes place in a fictitious 20th century Europe. There is of course the obligatory evil Empire, and the less evil tiny country simply trying to survive. Like Final Fantasy and many other console games over the last 15 years, it is rife with cutscenes. I chose the Japanese audio, so I don't know what the english audio sounds like.   The game play, while not exactly innovative, is still entertaining, and requires a lot of critical thinking on thge player's part.  ",

This game is simply put: Amazing.   Why? You may ask. Well, VC is extremely well done, even the port is extremely well done. It has a strong story (for me that is... dunno about you), there is progress among our main characters, visual upgrade to the equipment, matching music for combat and cutscenes and best of all: Strategy (as in third person turn-based game). VC requires you to know when you should, and shouldn't attack, because: if you bluntly go directly into combat, then wave goodbye to your soldier! Honestly, I haven't played such a good game for a long time... Although the game has about 30-40 hours gameplay (which is short for some people), it offers a lot.  I tell you this: You like story, use of your brain to when and how, this is what you ought to buy.  This I personally give a full 10 / 10 for being Amazing with a big A.",

The game has so many great things.  Graphics are good, the Story is good, soundtrack is fantastic and the gameplay is great.  The big problem of the game are the winstates. Most maps are won by capturing a Flag X in the enemy basecamp.   The problem with this is, that the game rewards not to be a good general, but a fast General. There were endless situations where the logical solution would have been to go around the enemy and hit them from the back, but that would have needed one more turn and a worse mission rating. The game often forces you to use suicide tactics to capture the flag as fast as possible. This often also leads to endings where 'winning' doesn´t feel right, because half the map is still full of enemies but to get the best rating, speed runs to the enemy flag are often necessary.  Because speed is so important, half of the soldier types in the game become useless for most missions (apart from some special missions where normal tactics don´t work) since scouts are so much more superior to all other classes. Thats especially sad for the tank which in most missions is just standing arround, because moving him costs far too many Command points.  Its like a shooter where you are given the best weapon in the second mission and there is no improvement in picking other weapons.   Its a real shame. If the game would rate the mission on soldiers killed or wounded. plus enemies killed PLUS a sort of Time limit as another factor, it would be so much better.",

I have seen some people complain that it has a too sunny view on war which I find laughable as just in the opening 5 minutes you see the Empire displaying racism and willing to shoot women and children. I will admit that it does not go into the extreme darkness that can be seen in war but this is a game and if it were too realistic no one would play it as it would be no fun.  You can easily play for pure fun and finish missions with a C or D grade but also you can choose to aim for B or even A grade and it is quite challenging and you will need your thinking cap to succeed.

It's an interesting mix that thankfully treats the events of the War with the utmost respect, while also inviting us into it's wonderful &amp; scary world in a relaxed manner.  The characters are mostly great, with Welkin &amp; Alicia's relationship surely going down as one of the greatest &amp; most believable in the history of video games. A few of the villains are a tad predictable, and a lot of the minor characters are done to extremes (Jann &amp; Leon being good examples of this), but they're for the most part ignorable, and do not detract too much from the overall enjoyment of the game. Sadly, the voice acting is nothing special, but the audio design as a whole really is top notch, and ties in perfectly with the games beautiful, unique style.  Regarding the gameplay, combat is a bit hit and miss. It's overly simple &amp; easily exploited, with a ranking system that makes little sense but still remains important, and minor issues like the odd invisible wall that bullets cannot penetrate, and tiny lips and dips that can foil the movement of a ten tonne battle tank. There are a couple of high quality combat mods that are supposed to be worth checking out, and while I can't comment on those personally, I'd definitely recommend checking them out if you have the time.  Overall, as a lovingly crafted tactical JRPG, Valkyria Chronicles has a lot going for it, but there's also quite a lot to overcome if you're wanting to see it through to the very end.

Even though the game gets kinda repetitive as you do more and more missions (atleast for me), it's still very satisfying to finish them and move forward towards the story finale. And when you do get to the end, it will be worth it!  Gameplay is somewhat difficult - you get thrown into a battlefield with units of your choice. Problem is you have no idea what you stand against, and this game in particular likes to surprise you all time in this regard (and often not in a positive way). On the other hand, replaying missions, when you know what to expect, is like playing with massive advantage you even feel bad for getting away with it.  All in all, I think they did the right decision, game is challenging this way without getting stuck when you repeat the mission. Just don't get mad when you think you owned the mission and then all hell break loose and you get wiped. ;)  10/10 if you like these kinds of games (turn-based strategy), but people with aversion to anime, go back to XCOM.

Some of them are absolute classics and there is potentially a very big market that will enjoy the experience of a 'HD remake' if the port is done right.  The graphics are beautiful and unique, and not too demanding on a slower system. The gameplay I would say mixes the strategy of Fire Emblem with the third person movement of say Sanctum. The story is gripping and the characters are deep. As well as tactical turn-based combat you can level up your squad, tank and weapons. As the story progresses the characters' relationships with each other develop, but there is a lot of replay value here too as there are a lot of people to choose from who aren't necessarily main characters, but are deep and detailed all the same.

            "review_text": "I came to this game as a Fire Emblem fan looking for the same experience on PC. This game might be that.  I have to say 'might' because I have a few gripes, or rather, there are a few differences that I find troublesome. I want to make it clear that I do think the game is good and encourage you to pay attention all the way to the end to find out why.  1. You really have to like cutscenes. I'm admittedly only 4 or 5 chapters in, but the balance of cutscenes to missions has been absurd. I would assume (and hope) that the gameplay takes a greater role in later chapters, but the start is a little slow.  2. You are immediately forced to chose 20 characters for your squad, and each character starts pre-loaded with up to 3 friendships and I think 4 different traits such as pollen allergies and being chatty. It's a very daunting choice and lacks the slow building of your relationship with each character that Fire Emblem is so good at.  3. Every character of each class ranks up the same. This is a similar gripe to above. It's a very impersonal system that, while lacking in annoying things like levelling up Donnel on hard mode, takes away a little of that player-character relationship.  I said that I liked the game though, and that lies entirely in the actuall tactical combat. Every mission so far has been challenging, offering unique tactical issues that were not in previous missions. I hear I might have to grind some Skirmishes later, in order to level up for the story missions, but if they are designed as well as the story I don't expect that to be a problem at all.  In short, this is a great tactical game, but lacking in some of the RPG elements that Fire Emblem excels at. The gameplay (although sometimes a little slow) will not leave you disappointed and wanting for a challenge, but in-between you might wish you could engage more with your squad. ",

Once CD-ROM discs came out and it was possible to have voice actors in games, reading a novel in between every battle became pretty annoying; I played Final Fantasy 7 for about 15 minutes before quitting and I played 8 a bit longer. I haven't played a jRPG since.  UNTIL NOW! Valkyria Chronicles is... I mean it's decent. There's more strategy involved in the battles which is what I enjoyed with Final Fantasy: Tactics. Everything is presented in book format (hence Chronicles, I imagine) so there's no map to explore or anything like that but it still presents you with a lot of lore and backstory via the book you 'read' as you play.  It's all superficial though. It may feel like you're playing a strategy game, but you're still just playing a turn based jRPG that lets you walk your characters around as if you were playing a 3rd person shooter. There's a lot of 'woe is me' Anime BS going on in between missions and some veiled pedophilia but if you can get over 12 year old girl soldiers wearing cat ears, it can be enjoyable in small doses.

There are a lot of little hang ups and problems with shoving turn based strategy and third person action shooter together, but honestly the combination is more interesting than it is flawed.  What this game does accomplish is a cool setting with a cool aesthetic, seriously the art is super well done. Unlike a lot of tactics games, this one keeps the game fun while still dealing with the reality of warfare, that is to say there isn't an Advanced Wars 1 and 2 style 'lawl fighting is great' after losing literally hundreds of troops and combat machines. Unlike a lot of WW2 games, there are a lot of little touches on the not so great side of war, like that civilians often get caught up in the conflict with nowhere to go when they're between two armies other than hoping that joining one of them will give them some control over their lives (or deaths), that the worst in people can show up (like prejudice against certain people) and that not everyone in the military gets preferential treatment like a lot of the 'heroes' in games usually set in this era (as you're technically a militia rather than a regular army even though you fight just as hard and are given missions that even the regular army doesn't want to do).  The absolute coolest thing about this game though is that every trooper has a personality. You get this in both the fact that each has individualized voice acting (which is ♥♥♥♥ing cool enough, like wow) and that each soldier has individual ways in which they both have traits and represent them in combat. Some of them have a pretty decent effect on how that combat goes too: If your engineer prefers the company of women you'd better shove her in with your women troopers so that she fights harder, if your trooper is prejudiced against darcsens you might want to pair them up with non-darcsen troopers so that they fight better overall. Soldiers will have people they like and pairing those people together will mean they'll probably fight a lot better and work to protect their friends. Soon your fighting unit starts to work in certain ways because of your troops preferences, even if on paper a lot of them are largely the same. You can totally replace them if they actually die in battle too: you level up troopers by class instead of on an individual basis, so if you level shocktroopers to level 4, all your shocktroopers, the ones in your squad now and ones you might add in the future, are level 4. That said, there have been more than a few missions I've delayed to med-evac troops even though it would honestly save time to just let them die, because a. I know how they work as individuals and b. this game honestly makes it easy to get attached to them.  That last part, right there, alone, makes this a good game. The rest of it paired with it is just icing on the cake. Really, this game is phenomenal and I hope we get to see the sequels on steam soon.",

(However, in this game it's easier to keep people alive because you have 3 turns to reach your wounded soldier and call a medic.)  Anyway, the anime story line was actually pretty interesting despite the cheesy, cliche anime romance. The story kept me coming back for more even until the finale. (I thought the ending after the credits was particularly charming.) I thought the artwork was beautiful and the music, mostly, was excellent. The voice acting was very believable, too.   As far as the challenge level, I thought the game was very challenging and a bit stressful at times (here's looking at you, desert level 7.) However, eventually you figure out the strategies for each level and they're all doable (well, maybe not level 7.)  I played using a keyboard and had no problem navigating my foot soldiers across the battlefield. The tanks, however, seem rather tricky to figure out at first, especially if you're trying to turn it around.  I got about 40 hours of gaming in by the time I beat it, but I'm a bit of a completionist and perfectionist when it comes to levels that you get ranked on.   Give this game a shot. It's fantastic.",

It does have some flaws but I was pulled into this game by the characters and interesting plot. Game-play is mostly solid. Just don't mistake it for a shooter or you will be disappointed. Realism of any kind is out the window with this one. This isn't meant to be a gritty Gears of War or Red Orchestra and the 'heavy parts' are mostly tongue and cheek. Think of it as a story rich game of chess where you can observe what your pieces are experiencing. Expect a wide variety of tones from the characters and storyline. Overall its something different, fresh, and truly memorable. I was happy to experience it thanks to the Steam port. It even made me believe that SEGA still has talent and potential.  I would also construct a list of things Sega Overworks could polish up to make this great game absolutely perfect. If you guys at Overworks see it then take this critique with love because its meant to be constructive advise.  Add auto-save between levels. Upgrade the cover system. If your clever like me you can aim around things but still. Allow cut-scenes to be skipped up front. Some people just prefer game-play. Fine tune the units, perks, and movement points system for extra balance. Make the menus a little easier to navigate. Add some sort of coop maybe? Where you and a friend can make maps and beat them together with your troops? Don't do a thing with the graphics they are beautiful. Maybe even timeless. Also localize VC3! The Western fans want it!",

The story and characters are also likeable, and the gameplay itself has set a standard for games like the latest UFO: Enemy Unkown iterations.  All in all, VC is a timeless classic.

This feels very similar, with its anime style and turn-based tactical combat.  I have a few grudges with Valkyria Chronicles however. First off: The presentation is really weak. And by that I don't mean the graphics, I mean the way your missions are presented. The menu is a book, and on every 2 pages there will be a mission. And up to 7 (!) cutscenes. Most of the times you watch a cutscene, go back to the book, choose another cutscene. That just feels tedious. I like the characters, but I want to play a game. For example: Once you get to the army academy you are told to explore the academy, and from now on you can go to the armory, R&amp;D etc. But why do I have to do that via menu? Why can't I really explore the academy by walking through it?  Also, going into this with Fire Emblem in mind I was hoping that I would bond with all of my characters. I don't, because while they do have unique names, looks and properties, they don't really have a personality and you just recruit them via menu. You learn nothing about them.   Now I listed a lot of negative things, but I really do enjoy this game. If you like FFT and Fire Emblem and you want a game with a different type of world, this is for you. It is just not perfect.",

That, and each combat session is divided by 3-7 'scenes' each about a minut long, and requiring you to select, and play each one. It's like 'quick time event' - the game.  If you are patient, I will reccomend this game. I know it will be worth it, but I cant sit around waiting for paint to dry.

When they're moving, whoever's turn it is gets shot by everyone in your army that can see them.   This led to me dying instantly to 5 enemies and a tank for trying to move 3 inches, and multiple enemies killing themselves running across my field of vision.  I know this game has some great reviews, and maybe when you can work around this system it's not so annoying. But this absolutely ruins the game for me.

            "review_text": "one of the best rpg games i've ever played  Set in 1930s in the midst between the Gallian war and the Empire, a small neutral town called Bruhl gets taken. Here we are introduced the memorable characters of Alicia and Welkin Gunther and the start of a small tiny front facing a giant military might  CHARACTERS: 10/10 All of the characters in this game are very memorable, with actual noticeable growth over time. You can't help but feel invested into each character as they each have their own unique story before joining Squad 7. For instance, Rosie, the hotshot, learns the harsh realities of war and starts to slowly belate her prejudice against the hated Darcsens. Or Welkin, the main character, learns to translate his scientific curiosity into actual leadership, staking his reputation on the line in order to win his comrade's trust and loyalty  What's great about the character development as well is it is not completely one sided. You learn about the opposing army's side with little snippets of dialog and can actually relate to what and why they are fighting the war. Some fight for power, some for their country, some for loyalty to others. War in itself brings about the worst and best of people, and this game as silly as it sounds potrays this very well  STORY: 10/10 Following character development, the story is actually what'd you'd seem as realistic fiction. Everything in the story seems plausible and almost every plot pitfall is actually considered. I won't go into details here as it would be a spoiler  Each and every decisive victory over the battlefield for your squad feels like a step in victory towards winning the war. Plot twist and turns are evident, and the story feels like a living breathing thing, changing based upon the victories your squad makes. Your squads reputation becomes well known, and you start fighting a long line of battles to achieve strategic advantages. Even when the battle seems impossible, your squad always finds a solution around it, even during battle.  The story has so many great plot lines going for it : war torn themes, love, betrayal, hatred, ethics, etc. If you had to compare this story plot to an actual book plot, it would be like mixing Harry Potter and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' wrapped up in one game.  GRAPHICS 9/10 PC port was pretty good, it didn't match that well for 1960x1080p resolution. Sometimes it was hard to see the enemy at a far away distance because of how pixelated it looked, but it didn't matter since there was a line of sight on your character anyhow   ART AND MUSIC: 10/10 Music in itself can really change how an audience feels about a game, or a movie. The music is spot on protraying the tragedies of war, and the hyped up tension of a firefight.  Art in itself is very anime japanese-style, its not everyone's cup of tea but I enjoyed it.  GAMEPLAY 10/10 Gameplay reminds me of XCOM but with a classic artist style look and appeal, with a mix of Fallout VATS system. There's actually a good deal of strategy when it comes to positioning your units, and the game progressively gets more difficult as the game goes on  There were some bull**** moments though, nearing the mid point of the game when you fight off a super large tank.  It felt like the enemy was cheating in every sense of the way at that point. However, the game does get a little easier imo as the game goes on, especially when you level up your classes and get better weapons.  Sometimes its too easy to cheat through the game by reloading your save to get the best possible outcome / chance of making all your shots hit. It does get challenging trying to achieve an A+ rank on a mission in the fewest moves possible, and makes you think about what the most efficient pathing is  Enemy AI can be kind of stupid sometimes, which makes the game easier than it is. Enemies could easily flank your main character and win if they wanted too  FINAL THOUGHTS:  This game will be a timeless classic that I will probably play again a couple of years from now There's a second and third game but I don't think I will be playing it anytime soon  Average gameplay time = 30 hours",

            "review_text": "I was not all that impressed with this game. The first impression was good. The artstyle is lovely, the story was entertaining enough and at first glance the combat seems fun. But i found myself losing interest in the game quite fast.  Lets start with the story. The story so far has been interesting and the characters have been nice enough. Each character has a distinct look which is lovely and it great that this is also true for all of the characters in the squad. The story and the characters are certainly animehhhhh which might turn some people off but i have no problem with. They way they jump from being serious to lighthearted can sometimes be a bit odd but there is a certain charm to that in some way.  But my problem with the story is just how cutsceny the whole game feels. Every chapter is filled with cutscenes and there is also a ton of downtime in the actually missions. So far all of these cutscenes have contained no interactivity at all and there is just so much of it that the game feels more like a movie with some interactive parts than a game with some movie parts.   I did not personally enjoy this and i would have prefered if they either made the story more interactable or allowed me to move around in the base as a character and actually feel like a character instead of simply dropping a bunch of movies on me through the interface. But this is very much a personal preference.  The interface is by the way obviously designed for a controller even though it works alright with mouse and keyboard.  But the combat sections of the game is where i think that the game dropped the ball. There is some strange stuff in the combat that becomes very obvious very quickly. The hitboxes for stuff in the environment are often larger than the visual representation which is extremely annoying in a game where every attack matters.   The game is also full of invisible walls for your characters movement. At best this is simply annoying when it leads to you wasting movement points but it also forces you to go exatly where the developers wanted you to go. In practice this means that you can't go a couple of meters in the forest next to you to get a clear shot or to flank your enemies and i think that this is a very odd design choice for a game that is supposed to be tactical.  But there are just a bunch of stuff in the combat that does not makes sense. Crouching behind cover means that you get a defense bonus and immunity to vital shots. Ok fine, but these bonuses are still in effect when the attacker is at the same side of the cover which leads to certain units being able to take a silly amount of shots from an attacker which stands just beside them.  Some people might just accept this and see it as another rule in the rulebook that they need to take into consideration in combat. But the way is see it is that the rules should fit to the gameplay and the visual representation and this rule does not fit into what i think should happen if the player flanks and shoots an enemy behind cover in the third person perspective.  The AI is also quite weird and it often throws away a large part of its turn doing nothing. Which is fortunate in a way since it otherwise could quite easily screw you over. The way units return fire when its not their turn is very odd and the computer could really screw the player over if it actually just stayed behind and focused on a single unit.  In the end i just found myself forcing myself to play another chapter every evening and that is not a good sign. I can see how some people might really be into this game but it was not for me.   ",

My version (PC) has numerous bugs; from buttons not working unless I tab out to certain areas of the maps that I can't go to or my characters fall through.  But the worst part, imo, are the missions. There's considerable inconsistencies with how to play one level from the next and there's very little leeway to make mistakes. I rarely am able to win a mission on my first try, but this isn't because the opponent is skilled or tough; Most of the time, its because the 'briefing' provides so little or false information that I deploy the wrong units.   In terms of the inconsistencies, there's maps where your primary goal is to capture the flag ASAP, and you're rewarded for bypassing other objectives to take the flag. Then there's maps that punish you for capturing it quickly, which is frustrating because of the amount of set-up things take. The game is relatively slow paced, so it gets really frustrating to see a carefully laid out strategy fail because THIS tank is immune to machine gun file while ALL other tanks were not. Its these lack of inconsistencies and the amount of time it takes to find out the differences that really kill it for me in this game.",

Could've been much better, the port of the game to PC has done an extraordinary job fixing some of the bugs that plague this game, however too many remain, with the addition of more game breaking faults.  As this game will probably not be getting patched, these are what to look forward to, while trying to enjoy what is at it's core, a very fun strategy game.  -The tank controls are very unpredictable, sometimes when you press 'left' the game rotates the tank to the left, other times you press 'left' the tank begins to drive backwards. The real problem is that the game uses two modes (keyboard/mouse) of input when only one was necessary. Ideally the mouse would be used to pan the camera, what it does however is begin to spin your tank out of control, in this game you only get so much 'movement' and then your turn is over.  -The tank is in EVERY mission, sure the tank can kick some major butt in most situations, but when it's not useful, the tank simply becomes a huge escort mission (One that can be killed with a single shot or within a single enemy turn pretty easily.) You can try to use the tank as mobile cover in this scenario, however the buggy controls will often cause you to run your teammates over, not doing any damage, but still frustrating.  -Unskippable cutscenes during missions, this is only frustrating when you fail and retry a mission, normally this isn't much of a grievance, but they sure can drag on and on, repeating something that was at one time useful, but is now rage inducing to be said again.  -Sometimes you just miss, maybe it's some kind of RNG element at work here, but sometimes you just miss a target literally a meter or two in front of you. It's frustrating, but it is a strategy/FPS hybrid, I'm sure for those who have played enough of it, can work with it, but for those of us not willing to put in the amount of time, just go ahead and avoid snipers. And forget about any Lancer (anti-tank) skill shots either, unless you're completely masochistic.  All in all, the game is still interesting, it's worth $10, however I'm only saying that because it's too late for a refund, I'd rather just have my $10 back.",

I noticed that this game is not so much a tactical turn-based game, put a puzzle game under a guise of a strat-jRPG-lite-psuedo garbage.   After a certain point levels become nearly impossible to complete with out some strange and arbitrary movements , attacks and unit placements, that really take away from atmosphere of the combat and the game itself. All of this cannot be discovered by logic, however only by constant trail and error and/or the use of guides.

I will mention below a few of the redeeming aspects, that and i am a hard headed idiot that was determined to beat this game into the ground. Instead it beat me into the ground - and not in the good way like Hotline Miami, or a rewarding RPG like Pillars of Eternity ; it beat me into the ground like an abusive girl friend with a fetish for half baked curb stomps.    I am all for difficult games, and grinded through many nonesense missions which are meant to be beat using minimal troop outputs for quick completions, something which was not very obvous at first. Then all a sudden, the last few levels introduce a massive difficulty spike - FORCING you to go back and redo these stupid missions battles just to grind XP. I had been fed up by this game at this point, but this was the last straw. (this is all without getting into some rediculous plot decisions and loopholes or the pretty poorly implemented 'atribute' syestem).   It is a shame because the graphical style and ART direction are wonderful in this game, and (despite being super trite and anime, i mean it is a japanese game) the characters were likable enough that i didn't want anyone to die.  ~E~",

For instance, putting snipers in high positions is a no brainer, but they will get sniped by tanks, i effin' kid you not.   Not really as much strategy as I was hoping to find after hearing about this game for the past oh, five years? It kept popping up on good rpg list and the like. I really like the animations, story is cookie cutter and a bit obtuse given the ww2 emulated setting. Also it has the utter stupid system of being able to use command points to move and shoot 1 unit as many times as you'd like. So, i have 9 units on field, and all I do is, use tank, heal tank as needed, snipe when i can, and that's it. It's immune to regular fire, so once enemy anti-tank units are gone, just go nuts.

There's a tremendous amount of interesting (and mostly positive!) discussion to be had about the design, but the overall experience is dragged down by consistent frustrations. Highly recommended if you're a turn-based strategy junkie AND interested in game design AND aren't inclined towards perfectionism. Much less so if you don't intersect all three of those groups.  The core gameplay of VC is a frankly brilliant fusion of turn-based strategy with third person shooter. Each turn, you can activate units a certain number of times, with each activation letting you move the unit freely about a 3D map and line up a single volley of shots. It's intuitive while also being totally unique, and elements like terrain and return fire work in a clear, logical way. Units come in 5 classes with distinct strengths and weaknesses, and each character has their own individual features (as well as chirps and emotes) to distinguish them from others of the same class. It makes a wonderful first impression.  The game manages to be less than the sum of its parts, though. Unit upgrades are based entirely on how many turns you take to beat missions, and these requirements - especially in the early game - encourage a breakneck sprint across the map. That leads to (for example) 4 of your 10 units rushing across a map doing all the work while the other 6 sit in base, never getting used. Which is fine (kind of) except that it's also easy for a unit to be killed in a single enemy action or turn if you take a wrong step, and pinning your success on so few units makes a single death reset-worthy. The result is a fiddly, save scum-y experience as you get derailed by fluke hits/misses, surprise enemies out of the fog of war, and so on. While some blame undoubtedly lies on the player (i.e. me), the 'right' way to play is not the 'fun' way to play, and VC trains you to do the former rather than the latter.  There are other issues as well - arguably useless character classes, unreliable character abilities, characters whose special unlocks make them totally unusable, buffs that are barely ever worth their cost, a very pretty UI that is not always helpful, annoying rules surrounding attack animations, tedious and unskippable cutscenes, and more - but the game flow is definitely the biggest hiccup. If you can resist the urges to execute everything flawlessly or spend time grinding on filler content, there's lot's to appreciate. It's just a shame that the game doesn't always seem to want your love.",

Cons: The combat system is lacking some serious ui overlay to actually make the game bareable (like showing a vision cone/range of enemies) aswell as not clearly explaining how gimmicks work.

Overly long battles, being shot at constantly during your turn (wait isnt this a tbs?), bad pathing with characters constantly getting stuck behind eachother or on invisible walls etc. The enemy AI is easily manipulated but can make shots you would otherwise miss over and over again-esepcially frustrating at the end of a battle when they 1HKO your tank (instant game over).  The story is decent but the mood is all over the place. It's often way too cheery for a game loosely based on WW2. Especially during every mission when your character jumps for joy with a smarmy remark after killing someone.  This seems more like a visual novel with a 3D tbs tacked on. I wouldn't reccomend this, too frustrating to want to go further.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Horrible port, mediocre game. Fun strategy ruined by nonsensical, constricting game design and completely bland characters and setting. If you want to try it, get it on console.  The negative rating and TL;DR aside, I'm going to start with the PC port of this game. I'm going to ramble a bit but bare with me.  I don't know about you, but I'd never played FFXIII, as I went to PC during the rise of the PS3 and 360 in my teenage years, and as such, when it was ported to PC and released on Steam, I gave it a fair try, and for the £10 it was being sold at, it seemed fair.   Moments into PC FFXIII, as I'm sure many other people found out as well, I found that the maximum resolution was 720p. I was highly dissapoinited in not having an option as simple as resolution, but I could play it in Windowed mode and do other things too, so that was fine. Later on, I tried to get out of the in-game options menu by hitting the escape button, only to find that I had been released from the clutches of the options menu, by the escape key closing down the entire game, my objective fulfilled whilst also having my aim to actually play the game being ♥♥♥♥ on. Coupled with my discovery of a 30fps frame limit and no sound options of any kind, FFXIII was already off to an incredibly poor start.  However, I made compensations here and there, such as using the Windows Volume Mixer and sheer determination to at least give the game itself a fair try, and over time, I came to find that I really rather enjoyed the game, the story (despite the climax of the story being the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing thing I've ever seen) and I even liked Hope, as he progressed into a very likeable character who was the core motivation for the other characters.  Fast forward a few months, and I see Valkyria Chronicles on Steam, too. On sale, no less and having heard that it was a interesting series that was pretty decent from various friends and other people, so I elected to give it a try under another of the 'Console JRPGs from the 360 Generation I've missed' category. This list is upsettingly large. And this morning, I installed the game whilst taking a nap and booted it up to find that, instead of being deafened by default, I can configure the game before booting. Wicked. Oh wait, never mind, there's just graphics options.  At this point, my standards being lowered curtousey of the FFXIII port, I was most impressed that there were actual graphics options, though limited, but I can at least set my resolution to 1920*1200, and I can even set my framerate to... 30... fps... (My dear friends disagree with me here and say that 30fps is better than literally everything above it. I think otherwise)  ...Right, well, I put that at 'Refresh rate', but I have a feeling the game will be capped at 30 most of the time regardless.  I booted up the game to notice two things: I am now midly deaf, because the volume defaults to full, and my resolution option was a complete lie, as it is actually 1920*1080, with hideous black borders on the top and bottom of the screen. The lazy ♥♥♥♥♥. Having discovered that there are no mouse controls to speak of, and the keyboard controls are wonky at best, I rebooted the game with my controller plugged in, in the hopes that it would work. It does.   With controller in place and ears numb, I navigated my way to the options menu, and turned *all* the sound volume down to 20% or less, and turning on Japanese voice acting, which I was quite happy was in, as Jap voice acting tends to be superior to English. Now I've set my volume to a reasonable level and begun the game, I've noticed something; I am, once again, deaf, as apparently the volume controls affect only roughly 40% of the actual game at best: the menus and the in-game combat. This wouldn't sound like a bad thing, but there was such a vast amount of maxed out volume exposition, I had to alter the volume through other means, which is absurd.  This is, in fairness, about where the moaning about the port ends, sort of, since all the aforementioned problems remain and recurr, but infairness to the port, the quality of it doesn't get any worse. However, going back on my thoughts at the start, Final Fantasy XIII was a higher quality port than Valkyria Chronicles. I didn't think that anything could be physically worse than that port, I honestly didn't, but Valkyria Chronicles is easily now my number 1 worst port in history.  Port quality - 2/10, if I have to give a numerical value. Incidentally, all of my complaints about both ports were fixed in the FXIII port with an update, and ports of the later games in the series are of vastly higher quality, to be actually rather good ports. Good job, Square Soft, many props for listening to your consumer base and fixing your game's problems.  Now, onto the game, as this is where the story continues. Or begins, with a man drawing some fish to the looks of worried villagers nearby, who think that this man with the obsession of fish is a bit strange. In fairness to them, he probably is, and the main love interest, who walks onto the scene next seems to think so too, and tries to arrest him out of sheer disgust. Or at least I'd like to think so, much of the dialogue was really quite funny and enjoyable, but almost always for the wrong reasons, like when taken out of context. I'm still not sure whether this is a point in Valkyria Chronicles' favour, it probably isn't, but I was still enjoying the game so far so hey ho.   Roughly thirty minutes of exposition and terrifying disembodied heads that float around the screen later, I actually get to play the game, isn't that nice? and it starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission, which is perfectly fine and good. Having found out about crouching behind sandbags before the game tells me I can, I wonder aloud why I can't crouch or hop over anything else of near-waist height. My friend on Teamspeak at this point tells me 'That's just how the game is.'  'Oh, right then.' I reply. Never mind, I guess they were too idly to adapt the cover system to the rest of the objects in the world, but I can try to overlook this rather hefty flaw given just how gorgeous the game is, as it really is a very pretty game. Having completed the tutorial mission, I go on to what I hope is more missions and fighting my way out of Poland, as Germany has invaded, and instead find that I get to watch yet more dialogue about the hometown that is entirely inconsequential and various other things, for a very long time, longer than all the introductory scenes, in fact, and at this point I'm beginning to lose interest in the characters because I JUST WANT TO GET MY BLUE FIREMEN TO SHOOT SOMETHING. PLEASE, LET ME PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.   I understand that JRPGs have exposition and story telling, and I very much like that about them, but at least make the story interesting. I, among many other people, I hope, already know at least generally what happens in WWII, and though the events have been adapted for this newish story, the characters so far have been entirely uninteresting as well. Fast forward through the first couple of missions, I'm finally playing the game, and skipping most scenes as I can read the dialogue subtitles faster than they speak it, which is nice. (Oh, I remembered something. In all the disembodied head cutscenes, ALL the dialogue makes horrible pop-in sounds every time the sound file is played. Outstanding.)  Enough of my story as it gets fairly repetetive, in parallel with the game itself (OOHH), so I'll just get onto what the gameplay is like, as I can finally do that now.  It's fun. It's not brilliant or entirely unique (though in this day and age it's increibly hard to make something truly unique), but it is certainly fun. The AI is peculiar and the game sometimes lies to you. There's some flaws, like invsible walls and the crap cover/ interactions, but it's fun. Just not fun enough to warrant finishing the game.   4/10",

The controls, especially for the tanks were a bit clunky and hard to maneuver sometimes. 3. (Slight Spoiler) There was mention of building a plane mid way through the game, leading me to believe that it would be usable in a later mission, and allthough it was nice how it was used, I would have liked to use it a sort of sky assault mission.  Yay Pros: 1. The Anime style, although off-putting in parts due to some Anime traits (I'm looking at you Selvaria!), ends up supporting the story very well. 2. The JRPG/FPS style present seems to fit very well, adding an extra layer of strategy sometimes and in my opinion, giving this game an edge over similar games in the JRPG genre. 3. The characters grew on me quite a bit during the game, to the point that once a unit fell in battle the mission quickly turned to a rescue mission, trying to get a medic to them as soon as possible. 4. The amount of backstory to everything in this game is immense, and although I didn't read everything, the side-missions especially gave a great deal of backstory not only to the characters, but also why they are the way they are. 5. The pseudo-WWII setting, and the idea of a small, neutral country stuck in the middle between two super-powers made the story very excitingly fictional, while still drawing some inspiration from real-life events.  6. It remided me a lot of Fire Emblem, which is probably why I love it so much because I love Fire Emblem :)",

It transfers over to a keyboard and mouse remarkable well with only 1 control issue that is easily worked around and otherwise 2 mere issues that should be able to be fixed with updates.  The control issue that I mentioned is only present when controlling either of the 2 tanks. While with your soldiers the mouse is simply a great way to look around the surroundings and move the screen for some reason the tank wants to rotate with the screen. With would not be a problem but that rotation counts against your movement on each turn. This can be avoided easily enough by simply using the number pad and turning the screen with 8,4,6,2. I only suggest this when using the tank though as with the soldiers being able to make the finer screen adjustments with the mouse is far more effective.  The larger of the 2 other issue I mention involve going back to the episode select of the book from the HQ. It happend 3 times in a row on me that the game will freeze on the load screen if you try to transition to fast. The last few times I've done it though as long as you wait about 5 seconds before confirming there has not been a problem.  Lastly the voices get a little distorted every now and then during cutscenes. Still able to understand them, there is just a rare line that has some static or sounds like it was delivered to far from the mic.  Really love this game and only due to the minor bugs do I give it a 8.5/10",

From the saddle bags on the tanks to the little map pinned to Welkin's shirt. Its incredible. The setting is fantastic as well. I love worlds created out of 1930s-1940s technology. There's not many of them compared to the ocean of fantasy and steampunk worlds, but this is one of the best the genre has to offer. The gameplay is a lot of fun. Due to a bug, the damage inflicted on my units was far higher than usual. It had something to do with the framerate and the game registering several consecutive hits at once. It wasn't a problem though. I actually preferred how difficult it made the game. There's a forgiving permadeath system. Units can die but it takes a lot of negligence to let that happen before the difficulty ramps up in the second half of the game. Leveling up classes instead of the units themselves is ingenius and perfect for this sort of game. The story, and on this I'm going to differ in opinion from a lot of my collegues, is nothing special. Its totally workman, there's nothing especially good or bad about it. It can get a little 'anime-y'. And don't get me wrong, I love anime, but it can get a little more K-On than Venus Wars, if you know what I mean. The game is not perfect. The Engineer class is severly underpowered, and there are certain tactics that can be exploited to make the entire game a complete joke. I reccomend not spoiling it for yourself and just playing the way you like. And not to beat yourself up over losing or letting people die. Just have fun. There are sequels to this game. They are PSP exclusives ( :^( ). I've played a lot of V2, its fun, but it doesn't hold a candle to this one. I really hope Sega wakes up and realizes this series deserves another proper fully fledged entry, not a portable grind fest.",

So when it came out on the PC - Yeah, I'm buying it.  It's a solid port. I've had not technical issues with it.  Biggest problem I have with the game is: The clunky book/chapters out-of-combat interface remained unchanged. I didn't like it in the original game, and was disappointed to see it persist in the PC version.   Smaller issues that may stem from me being me, rather than the game being flawed: Skirmish battles could have had been updated to feature some randomness in opponent behavior or placement. They tend to get boring immediately after the first time you play through them. A faster way to get back into the game after failing a mission would've been good. I currently can't motivate myself to pick the game back up because the idea of failing and needing to repeat the mission(cut-scenes and all) mentally tires me.   And that's the basic way the game progresses after a point. You start a new mission with little to no idea what's going to happen or what you're facing. You fail, naturally. You load the save. Try again with the update to your strategy. And repeat the process until you beat the mission.   I'm just saying, the restarting process could've been faster.  That said.   The game is pretty cool. Turn-based squad battles that are affected by various quirks your soldiers have.  Speaking of soldiers, you don't get as attached to them as you could, if they were given a more robust progression system or more dialog lines, but you do tend to stick with a few favorites that seem to cooperate well.  The story is anime-ish. Take that as good or bad depending on your own opinion on anime/manga. With characters being pretty one-dimensional. But it does serve as a good motivator to keep pushing forward and seeing how it develops.  I do recommend this game for people that fit one or both of the following: Like turn-based games. Like anime/manga.",

Instead, the only time the mouse can be used is when aiming during missions, and if that weren't the case, I'd just say buy the game for playstation instead.

Finally the story is really well done with amazing character development among the major characters, and the lore about the world and the war going on is very intriguing as well. If you are a WW2 buff, especially in films, then you'll also see some similar themes and elements from movies like Saving Private Ryan to Band of Brothers. Overall this is a must-have game for most gamers, especially if you enjoy a good story or turn based RPGs.   That said, there are a few flaws I should mention here. The biggest flaw is how it takes a lot of hits at times to kill certain enemies who are 'in cover'; however, you can clearly see their whole body since you are flanking them, but if they are crouching near some sandbags, then you are screwed. Then some operations are ridicolously hard. The game overall is challenging, and it can be very unforgiving with some of your mistakes at times. That said, some operations will have you go against unlimited reinforcements until you take out both enemy tanks who are way overpowered, then other operations the boss has what feels like can duck and dodge everything, even when you sneak up on them and they don't see you. That said, with the overpowered tactics the enemies have, then there are cheap ways to win. A quick example, but with the right orders and personel, then you can take the main base to win a couple of moves without killing many enemies at all. In reality it's ludicrious thinking a scout can win the battle alone against tanks, shocktroopers, etc. Then during some missions in which the enemy has a major advantage, then again there are ways you can cheaply win with the right orders and positioning your players before they appear. It's cheap, and it's a flaw that wouldn't be necessary if it wasn't for the over excessive advantages the enemies have at times, but it doesn't take away the fact this game is very good and is a must have. Easily a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "So, I was browsing for a jrpg for a 13 y o who's gaming, but haven't really found their niche yet, so we're trying out different stuff. Then I stumble on Valkyria Chronicles so I start to read up on it and find out that it contains tactical movement elements. This piqued my interest since that's something I like, and now I'm here.  I'd like to point out that, unlike what the tags for this game claim, this is not a strategic game more than you get the option to manage what soldiers are in your ranks and to some extent how they're outfitted. This game is about tactical combat. Also it's not an rpg, since you in no way 'play the story'. The story is scripted and the game play, again, is the tactical combat. So it's a visual novel with tactical combat.  Let's divide the good and the bad, starting with the good.  The story is interesting and takes place in a fictious version of ww2 Europe. This coming from someone who's not that into ww2, and find it somewhat overused as a theme in games, tv-shows, movies and so on. So here's a refreshing take that lends heavily from European history and culture.  The voice acting is really good which is a feat considering the large number of different characters in the game.  There is plenty of background material that is unlocked over the course of the game if one's interested in getting into the lore even more.  The tactical element is well thought through, and you have to manage what troops you bring into what battle, and not only make sure they work well together, but also try to manage it so that their drawbacks don't come into play too much.  Graphically the game is designed to look like a cartoon, painted in 2d. While the tactical movement is done in third person and you move around the map in 3d this does still work out well.  And now the bad:  There are some issues with controlling tanks during movement. Tanks have a tendency to move a bit as they want depending on which way the camera is facing. It seems that the problem is that movement is that controlling the tank is connected to the camera angle. This can be very annoying at times, but can be worked around, although you shouldn't have to.  Character movement includes a stopping animation that has to finish playing before you can move again. This can be dangerous if you accidentally stop in the line of fire of an enemy. Also if you don't exit a character immediately after having finished your actions with it any enemies that have clear line of fire to it will continue to fire until you do, which might net you a dead character if you're indesicive.  The terrain sometimes look like it would be traversable but isn't. This can leave your characters in bad spots simply due to there being no way of telling if you're going to be able to take cover behind a tree for example. Also according to the lore tanks were created to allow for trenches to be traversed. This is not the case in the game. You have to drive around.  The maps are very lacking and only rudimentary. They don't detail important terrain features enough, something that is vital in tactical combat.  There are some graphical bugs in the game that annoys me a lot, like someone's arm stretched out in an overhead arc and then attached to their hand.  I don't know if these are things the developers are working to fix, but as of writing this they have yet to do so.  Also there is little to teach you how to play the game. Gameplay tips keep showing up through the course of the game, but it would be nice to have a basic tutorial before starting the actual story.  In summary, my grade for this game lands somewhere between 6 and 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. If they fix the maps, the annoying graphical glitches, the controls and the terrain that's messing with movement I'd easily raise that grade to an 8, maybe even more.  All in all: - Nice setting even if you're fed up with or not interested in ww2. - Not an rpg. It's a tactical combat game. - Does have some bugs, but I haven't discovered anything completely game breaking yet. - Interesting story. - Good voice acting.",

The story's well-written, and the characters are deep and believable. Even the rank-and-file soldiers in your squad who aren't important to the plot have names, backstories, quality voice acting, and personality traits that affect their combat performance. And the core mechanic of classic turn-based strategy combined with real-time third-person controls that put you right in the action is simply brilliant. It's even got plenty of replay value, with a new game plus mode and challenge missions.  So, what mars it? Just two things. One, the AI is incredibly stupid. It's depressingly easy, for example, to get enemies to kill each other by drawing an enemy soldier's fire and taking cover behind another enemy. And two, scouts eventually become overpowered - but that's only a big issue in new game plus. Should you start thinking, though, that cheap exploits make the game too easy, you've always got the expert skirmishes and bonus missions in the DLC to give you the experience of playing with severe handicaps.",

            "review_text": "Valkyria Chronicles looks like a WW2 inspired anime spin-off, but don't let it deter you if that’s not your thing. The game has so much to offer, and it rarely gets anything wrong.   The gameplay has you as a battlefield commander. At the start of each level, you place your troops at a spawn point. As you progress, you capture more spawn points, allowing you to re-deploy your troops if they’re too far behind from the front. It is turn based, and in third-person perspective, so when your turn arrives you choose a unit to control from the game map (which depletes a number of your 'command points'; costs vary per unit), move it to a location and kill an enemy or capture an objective. Once your command points are all used up, your turn is over. How far you can move a unit depends on that unit’s AP – “action points” - and that is where the tactical and strategic game comes in. Every unit’s move counts, so you need to think ahead before you get outmanoeuvred by the enemy.   There’s a selection of different unit classes you can compose your squad from: Snipers, who specialize in long range takedowns; Engineers, who restock ammunition and fix your vehicles; Lancers, who are rocket launching heavy weapons specialists, essential for anti-vehicular combat; Shock Troopers, who are your bread and butter assault classes, handy for clearing out enemy personnel in tight spaces; and lastly Scouts, who are lightly-armoured reconnaissance units and have the farthest range of movement. Choosing your squad composition is no joke. Your victory lives and dies upon it. Oh, and I forgot to mention you are supplied with a tank, which is the slowest moving unit in the game, yet has the most health and armour, and is fully customizable. This unit is essential – Welkin, the game’s hero, commands it. If it’s destroyed, it’s an instant game over.    Each squad member is unique. Not confined to just the main cast, there are over 60, and they each have their own model, personalities, histories, voices and stats - some of them, for a quick example, may not get along with women or men, they may even dislike being around Engineers; this will negatively impact their combat efficiency as part of the squad. But these negative traits almost always come with a bonus, giving you further tactical and strategic considerations. As you level up, research, and develop new equipment, these negative traits become almost negligible.    This might sound complicated now, but worry not. The gameplay is a marvel. It is easy to pick up and understand, yet has extreme depth of play and strategy. On some maps, you can win the game in a single turn if you play your cards right. On others, a little more thinking is required, but even if things go south, you can be sure there’s always a way out if you think hard enough.    Valkyria Chronicles has a wonderful cast of characters, all rendered beautifully in the distinctive Canvas engine (which Sega really needs to make more use of). Their stories are human stories, simple lives interrupted by the looming threat of war; they are a bunch of ragtag individuals fighting not just for their nation, but for each other and their homes. At some points you will genuinely feel for the cast, and I got emotional more than once.    The game is very well paced, going from minor skirmish battles to fully fledged combat zones once you’ve cut your teeth. And the story too is similarly well paced. You are given just enough in the form of character interactions and world events to eagerly look forward to the next breadcrumb.  The soundtrack is fantastic. It really sets the mood, and is never inappropriate.    There’s really not much else I can tell you about this game, except that it’s fantastic! You should really buy this title, it’s a great investment if you have free time that needs spending!  And once you hit the game’s finale, you better get ready for waterworks!",

Well, I think manual aim using mouse is much better than using gamepad and so far, manual aim is very crucial for this game... And more, SEGA also made this port support better framerate than PS3 version.  It's not a perfect port. There is some annoyance like no mouse navigation on the menu. You must using keyboard all the time for the menu navigation. But, apart from that, it's still a great game. One of the best and innovative tactical RPG even on today standard.  I just hope SEGA port the 2nd and 3rd installment to PC. And then continue this series one way or another and of course, put that on PC too if they'll do that...",

It is turn-based, yet acton happens in real-time, yet is mostly limited by a limit of how far characters can move as well as performing one action per activation. Also mixes in PRG elements such as class leveling and equipment management (though not as micro-managed as most). The story is a simplified almost Word War 2 as seen by anime. Charming characters, with interesting, albeit corny storylines. It deal with issues of racism and prejudice, with Darcsens in the plot in a sort of stand-in for Jews (or other minority), though it does not overly villify those with prejudices. The graphics are cell-shaded and very well done, and the controls are mostly smooth. One issue I had was when mouse controling tanks, as the game will sometimes interpret slight movements as a reason to wildly swing left or right, and seeing as tanks consume movement to turn....it can lead to problems.

Also they repeat themselves a lot in game. So listening to Japanese repetition isn't nearly as bad.  The gameplay is fun. It keeps you guessing what's around each corner.

Aesthetics: Good graphics for its time. A very nice art style mixing traditional Japanese anime and vibrant water colors.   Performance: I personally didn't have any significant problems with stability except for one bug where one of my characters dropped out of the bottom of the enviroment on a level and couldn't be used anymore on that level. Since it is a PC port, however, your milage may vary and thus caveat emptor applies here.  Gameplay: I gotta say when it comes to video games the Japanese don't screw around. This game was very, very difficult. The enemy AI isn't necessarily the smartest, but they do have some significant advantages over you. For starters they usually greatly outnumber you. This normally wouldn't be a problem, except that they rarely miss their shots, while your soldiers will miss critical shots left and right. This is compounded by the fact that sometimes the enemy will just completely dodge your attacks. This is honestly the source of most of the frustration in the game, along with some aspects (namely the interception fire rules) that are blatantly skewed in favor of the enemy AI, and the long time investments (up to 2 hours) each battle takes. That being said it is not necessarily unfair; you just have to be smart about your plays. It is a game that rewards skill and time invested in learning its systems.  Story: If you were afraid that because of the anime art style it would mean a generic anime story, then I am happy to inform you that your fears are not warrented. The story is quite good, with plenty of character development, well constructed dialogue, and memorable scenes. It definitely makes up for the sometimes frustrating level of difficulty.",

            "review_text": "If war is made up of long periods of boredom, punctuated by moments of sheer terror, then Valkyria Chronicles is similarly partitioned. Not by boredom and terror, but by story and gameplay, silliness and solemnity. Valkyria Chronicles is a JRPG, and it fully embraces that. It's full of cutscenes, expressive characters, and generally has an upbeat and cheerful sense of adventure. The main story is less about war, and more about love, and the ties that bind us. This surprised me, because I was expecting a more grounded story, based on the small amount of exposure I had to the game prior to playing it. I knew it was set in an allegorical universe based on World War Two, and the tone of the trailer and introductory cutscene seemed to indicate a place where history would be analyzed through the lens of the fantastical.  To be sure, there are some very serious concepts and historical events brought up. From concentration camps, to the cost to the human soul during wartime, to the morality of weapons of mass destruction, this game is about as shy in its utilization of allegory as C.S. Lewis. But those are placed directly alongside standard JRPG fare like fanservice beach parties and cute animal sidekicks, which makes it hard to give them the scrutiny they deserve. This disconnect can be very jarring.  The year is 1935, and Europa is entering its second continental war of the century. Fighting over a precious resource which is the backbone of industry, medicine, science, and the military, the Autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance has instigated hostilities by crossing their border with the Atlantic Federation, an alliance of democracies in the West. Caught between them is the nation of Gallia, which has always striven to remain neutral. Reminiscent of Belgium and the Netherlands (it even gets its name from the name of the Roman province that inhabited those very lands in the real world, Gallia Belgica), they rely upon a balance of power and a policy of universal conscription to keep them free. However, their rich stores of that precious resource prove too tempting for the Empire, and they seek to add Gallia to their conquests. You take control of Squad 7 of the Gallian Militia. As an underdog in a nation which is itself an underdog, you'll have to make miracles happen if you're going to win.  Gameplay essentially takes the form of turn based tactical combat, much like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or Xcom. However, it modifies that combat by shifting the focus from a top-down overview to an over the shoulder third-person camera. You manually control your soldiers as they run for cover, flank the enemy, and open fire. You take aim at your targets, and you will need to balance the extra damage of headshots vs. the reliability of body shots.   Also unlike most tactical games, the enemy is able to harm you even during your turn. Every unit is essentially on overwatch, and if you enter their line of sight and weapon range, they will shoot you. This simple alteration adds much complexity. You'll find yourself crouching behind cover, waiting until the enemy runs out of ammo and has to load a new clip, which gives you the opportunity you need to assume a stronger tactical position, or an optimal firing point. You'll discover the joys of providing forward cover with your tank, and of shattering your enemy's defensive lines with shell, cannon, and machine gun, leaving them open to your supporting infantry.  Outside of immediate combat, much of the gameplay revolves around visiting your headquarters on a regular basis to upgrade your squad's gear, level them up, unlock their special abilities, and to customise your roster. Unfortunately, there are very few choices to be made here, and it largely becomes a checklist that you must go through every time you complete a major mission. While the game is a JRPG, it does fall flat when it comes to upgrades and customisation. There are few options, and thus there is little investment. On top of that, the UI is obtuse, and rarely gives the information that you'll want to make an informed decision. If you're trying to min-max, you'll need to resort to third party sources.  Overall, though, the gameplay is highly engaging. It offers visceral tactical satisfaction, while also rewarding forward strategic planning. The battiefields are detailed and varied, making each mission a unique and memorable experience, and the stylized graphics really bring them to life. Resembling a watercolor, the engine does an amazing job at painting a colorful world that draws you in.  Amidst this combat unfolds the story of Squad 7. You'll follow and author their story as they clash against the Empire. Nearly exclusively following their operations, rarely will you be shown the larger scope of the war. Focusing more on the drama and relationships of those under your command, this is, at heart a love story. Despite this, the game still attempts to interlace moments of gravity which have relation to actual historical events and this, in my opinion, the game's biggest flaw. The tonal shifts are breathtaking, and the game shows no signs of awareness.  The most indicative example I can give is in one of the squadmates. You recruit some of them randomly as you progress through the game, and it behooves you to rotate your roster so that you can unlock their potentials equally. At one point, a new character pops up, and I slotted her into my active team. When this occurs, a corresponding entry is made into their personnel file, giving you some basic story and character traits. I took a look, and what I saw there blew me away. This character is twelve years old. In the standard fantasy worlds that JRPGS tend to inhabit, this is nothing too concerning. In a game that is styling itself as a facsimile of one of the most horrible, costly, and scarring events in the entirety of history, it's just jawdroppingly inappropriate.  If she was put in as a metaphor for the state of desperation and determination that a modern nation in arms has to be brought to in order to achieve victory, then it makes sense. The call to resist until the last, putting children and women in the line of danger is something that is all too real. Instead, the game is blissfully unaware that there might be something horrible in handing a twelve year old girl a rifle and sending her to the front lines to fight for Queen and Country.  It was at this point that I realized the game wasn't really trying to be more than a JRPG, and I should accept it for what it was. I began to enjoy it more and more, and as of the writing of this review, it is one of my absolute favorite games. Through a combination of engaging tactical combat, an endearing story, and a beautifully artistic graphics engine and design, it won me over. I was drawn into its world, and I accepted it, quirks and all. If you're also willing to do so, then I highly recommend Valkyria Chronicles.",

The backdrop is the war between the tiny coujntry of Gallia and the evil empire. What is refreshing is that it is based around conventional weapons, and you get to drive tanks. Your squad members are split into classes, each bringing their own abiliies to the fray. There are varied missions in terms of terrain, opponents and objectives which will require you to use everythign in your arsenal.   The PROs:  -The setting is awesome, a real feel for the characters and the story, it is immersive and you actually care what happens - The graphics are refreshing, an interesting style -Intuitive and thoughtful gameplay -Replayability potential is major. Even once you have finished the main campaign, there are new events to unlock, classes to level up and achievements to be got -The campaign can last 40-50 hours, so represents decent value in itself -This is a great port and the full package, all DLC from the console version is included -Full Japanese Audio CONs:  -I seriously can't think of any. Even at full price this is worth every cent  Buy it. You won;t regret it  ",

I'll find myself in moments of 'wow, that's somewhat funny!', 'The hell?'. In each chapter, I can't help but not be bored of the dialogue, this including the arguably stupid/silly moments scattered throughout the game. I love the combat as it gives a similar feeling to Fire Emblem.  Some bad points to make would have to be the 'here and there' dialogue that doesn't feel like it fits the moment. These sort of slap you out of the immersion of the game; not that it's hard to get right back in of course. There are some units I feel are obviously not suited to be played, which sort of limits the characters you can play as a whole. Also I feel pressured to use the main characters over others in their class that are statistically superior. One last small complaint is that I wish you could fast forward through some animations during battle, but it only takes an extra second or two a few times each chapter.  As far as final words go, I recommend this game enough to write a legitimate review about it. Suitable to those interested in strategy, story, anime-like. Not for people looking for mmo-like, in depth and complicated, open world lovers.  My rating, taking all tags into account, would be 9.5/10 and deserves a definite look by everyone interested in purchasing.",

The setting and story are interesting and I haven't skipped a single cut-scene since the beginning. Our main task is to operate with Squad 7 during imaginary Total War in setting similiar to Europe's 1930s, every soldier has a unique set of potential skills, likes and dislikes that influence each battle. Co-ordinating these potentials may change the outcome of every battle.  It's a unique game for me and I'm really happy I stumbled upon this little jewel.

The gameplay is enjoyable and never feels punishing as you are almost always able to recover and learn from your mistakes. There is also a wide cast of characters to recruit and use, all of whom have very one dimensional personalities. I found the characters very charming as they shouted out their various catchphrases, sometimes joining in, as I played through the game. The one major problem I had with the game is that it has some inconsistency with it's difficulty. I found that some missions were very challenging for me, but they would then be followed by missions I would just barrel through, rather than there being a slow incline (or steep incline) of difficulty.  If you are in the market for a JRPG or a turn based strategy game, I can not recommend this game enough.",

            "review_text": "Gameplay is awesome, story is dumb, and the story-telling makes me want to puke. Despite the story being so vomit-inducing, Id still recommend this game just for the gameplay.  What I love: 1) The gameplay is super fun. Its turn-based gameplay with a twist. Directly controlling the characters I’m sending to their death actually makes me care about them rather than strictly their 'numbers'. 2) Experience being applied to the entire class of fighter rather than individuals gives me less reason to throw furniture and start foaming at the mouth when one of my troops dies.  What I hate: 1) The game is TOO LONG. Even the super fun gameplay dries up after a while. Playing through just the main missions made me quit the game long before I finished it. 2) The grinding necessary to level my dudes up is infuriating. Again, gameplay is fun, but dries up when grinding through the same map you already played in the main mission 10 times to get experience and cash. 3) The story isn’t terrible, but it’s so cliché and predictable. Granted, that’s kind of par-for-the-course in JRPGs. 4) ANIME! I like me some complex anime (i.e. Death Note and Ghost in the Shell), but the stupid anime that survives entirely on repeating itself 1000 times (i.e. Dragonball Z), weird reactions of characters (i.e. FMA Brotherhood), and THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP OVERCOMES ALL (i.e. Pokemon) really exacerbates me...and this game is a whole lot of all that.  What I want to take behind the shed and put a bullet through its head: 1) Push-button-after-ever-line cutscenes. Forget about starting a cutscene and sitting back to watch; you have to keep pushing the button after everybody talks. This is compounded when the characters go back and forth 5 or 6 times about making a single point. (i.e. 'I got an idea' *push button* 'What’s that Welks?' *push button* 'I know how to get across the river' *push button* 'How do we do that?' *push button* 'I need your help to modify the tank' *push button* 'What’s this all about?' *chew off arm*) 2) In what parallel universe is it acceptable to split a single cutscene into 4 or 5, where you have to go back to the chapter select screen in between each one to select the next? This fact literally made me throw the controller across the room more than once. STOP WASTING MY TIME! The game is too long as is without this stupidity adding more garbage. 3) The voice-acting is surprisingly good for an anime-like game, but the script they had to work with...ugh, makes me want to puke.  Ill recommend this game, but I’ll also recommend skipping the cutscenes and grabbing some cheats that grant unlimited cash and experience so you don’t have to grind through the extremely tedious 'side-missions' a billion times.",

Ancient forgotten weapons, cute girls in military outfits, raceism against people with purple hair (???) and a School teacher / environmentalist who becomes a war hero.  Gameplay 8/10 - The game mixes turn-based strategy gameplay with a splash of real-time and pulls it off excellently. From trench warfare to tank combat, the game manages to keep it fresh with each new map and although the combat system is far from realistic it still manages to be lethal enough to keep it interesting. You'll need to flank fortified positions, use grenades and tanks to tackle opponents in cover and stay out of the enemy's line of fire at all times. Enemy tanks prove to be an almost insurmountable foe for any soldier not equipped with a rocket launcher, even they have to tread carefully around them. Meanwhile your own tanks prove to be excellent sources of mobile cover for your squishy infantry, the overall gameplay is satisfying and fun.  However, there are a few gaping holes in the gameplay balance and most maps can be cleared easily with 2-3 soldiers once you know where the exploits are. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem if not for the new game plus expert levels basically requiring you to use exactly those strategies to S rank them. This put a pretty big damper on the replayability of the game but the 1st play-though was fun from start to finish barring a small number of poorly designed maps.  Story 9/10 - The game is full of colorful characters. The core cast is full of shonen stereotype characters but even so the execution is excellent. Even the characters who are out of the spotlight of the main story are enjoyable. Every soldier on your squad is a unique person with their own quirks that come though their voice acting and even their gameplay before you ever bother to read their personnel file that contains their backstory. Don't expect any grim and gritty war-drama, the overall tone is absolutely a Shonen underdog story with the main character overcoming impossible odds at every turn. Still, in spite of the overall positive tone when the characters have those ups and downs you feel it along with them.  Graphics and Sound 8/10 - The character models and objects aren't particularly high-polly so there are some jaged edges visible occasionally. Aside from that though the game pulls off the anime/manga asthetic perfectly with vibrant colors and clean, crisp visuals. Explosion, smoke and bullet effects are intentionally cartoony looking, not particularly impressive but they fit with the overall theme. Muisic and voice acting are also solid.  Overall – If you like turn-based strategy games, tanks and shonen anime, you'll love this game.",

            "review_text": "Pros: 1) This game is a very good game as an introduction to the strategy genre. I find it amazing how they set up the system for selecting soldiers to bring with you into combat, and I love how they make it so that each character has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, a teammate may be powerful, but they have allergies, so they can't hide in tall grasses. Or, a character might feel comfortable on roads, which increases their attack when their on sidewalks and streets, but they don't like being around nature, so their attack would go down if they were near grass. 2) The combat mechanics are nice. Basically, each turn, you can move your troops a certain amount of times. What units you move, and where you go with that movement is up to you, but you have a limited amount of stamina, so you can't move around forever. You can shoot enemies during your movement, and depending on what part of their body you aim at, the amount of hits you get on them and the damage you dish out are different. 3) The art style is fantastic. Everything looks (and I'm pretty sure it is) handrawn, and it makes everything ingame look beautiful. I also find that this artstyle helps to broaden the amount of details on characters and models. All of the troops that you can add to your squad have unique designs, and that includes small details on their faces. It's amazing how great this style is, yet SEGA hasn't used it more often.  Cons: 1) The gameplay of the game doesn't start until 5-10 minutes ingame. Although I do enjoy the cutscenes (mostly due to the artstyle), I find that they can get to be quite long. I wouldn't mind this if there were less cutscenes, but it seems like the cutscene-to-gameplay ratio (at least up to chapter 2) is 3:1. Again, if you do not like story in games, and just want to get this for the gameplay, I do not recommend this for you. 2) Nothing. Really, I try to keep my reviews even so I have an equal amount of positive and negative points, but I can't see any other glaring issues about this game. It's that good.  So, would you like this game? If you are interested in the strategy genre, and don't mind lots of story, I'd say that the answer is a definitive, 'Yes!' However, if you aren't really interested in any of the story and just want to play it for the strategy parts, be forewarned that a large majority of this game will shove story down your throat. However, there are side-missions that you can play that have no impact or relation to the plot whatsoever, if that strikes your fancy. Overall, I'd say that this game is worth getting, just to try it out.",

The story bits drag on and only occasionally bring something interesting to the table, and the turn-based combat - as good as it is - has no speedup option, which it really needs in my opinion. Each mission can take up to an hour and a half if you tend to take your time and if you screw up, it can be an hour of progress that isn't that much fun getting back. I'm guessing that I'm roughly two thirds in, but I can't bring myself to finish it, because so much about it feels like a chore.  The game is pretty, it is littered with gorgeous understated designs, it has some fun likeable characters (even if the protagonist is a real bore), and the battle mechanics are solid. The third person view really adds to the experience and there are some pretty exciting scenarios. However, chances are that you are also at that point in your life when you say to yourself that life is too short to be playing JRPGs.",

            "review_text": "Originally bought the game for the story, but liked it for its gameplay.  The story is...... well it's not bad, but it's rather light-hearted. I'd prefer a story with a more serious tone. That said, there are quite a lot of memorable moments, and by the end of the journey, it felt satisfying. The members of squad 7 are all very likable. While they're not particularly unique in terms of presentation, they're still the kind of characters that you grow to like... and the death of that certain someone sure caught me by surprise :(  However, the writing quality of the story is inconsistent. A few scenes felt very awkward/out of place/cheesy (especially the romance. totally lacked development). On top of that, the English translation is god awful. I've lost count of how many times I went 'Wait... that's not what they said!' (I play with Japanese audio)  The combat is what I liked the most about the game.  I particularly like how they managed to make every single mission a unique tactical experience. When I first started the game, I had the fear that the combat may get repetitive soon like it did in Shining Blade, but that wasn't the case at all. Every mission had something different, and each fight felt unique. Each was reasonably challenging, and conquering each with tactics felt satisfying.  Mission design is very well done in this game... except for the repeatable skirmishes. those are like... ehhhhh  One thing don't like is how the mission ratings are based exclusively on the number of turns you take to clear it. If I take a more cautious approach, moving the whole team together and eliminating every threat i see, i'd most likely get a bad rating for taking too long. In most cases, the game encourages rushing tactics. While rushing does make sense in certain scenario, I don't like being forced into this playstyle for every single mission. It would've been better if the game can take other tactical aspect into consideration when giving out mission rating  Overall, I think this game is a flawed gem, but definitely worth a try. The controls on PC take a while to get used to, and the game's mechanisms may be confusing at first, but once you get past that, there's a lot of fun to be had. ",

Although, it's far from perfect, because, at leats in my computer; it had some graphic issues like one of marina's arm looked like an sphaggetti, largo lacked an abdomen for most of the time, welkin lacked a wrist, and so on. Also, the A.I. is not the most smartest one, but, what game really haves one? also, the pacing of the dialogs, and that you couldn't skip those you had already seen, it was awful. but, even with these problems (and surely even more), it delivers an experience that, some S-RPGS'S/T-RPG'S or other war-based games fail to deliver.

I slogged to capture a base for like 40 mins, only for the end dialogue to congratulate the flying pulled pork for its 'contribution'. I lost good soldiers on that mission, yet after a gruelling fight fuelled with blood sweat and tears, 'the animals of the forest' are heralded as the supposed cause for victory. Very upsetting and unmotivating.  Prior to purchase I heard that there were some 'sad' parts during the story. I genuinely hope this pig gets turned into bacon.

Anyways, this games is basically a tactical JRPG, it feels and plays a lot like Fire Emblem, but set in a mid 20th century european country, and you have guns and tanks instead of swords and magic and bows and that stuff. It has been really fun so far, but keep in mind that the slightest mistake or the wrong positioning can make you lose the battle (I just lost one because my tank got one-shotted by another one in the back, 'cause I slightly moved my tank to the right, I didn't think of it as important).

            "review_text": "I would recommend this game, but I can understand why some people dislike it. This is a turn-based squad tactics game with unique and unusual gameplay mechanics. There are five unit classes, which are pretty well balanced. Each turn you get a certain number of command points, which can be spent to buff your units and have them move and attack. You can use the points to move every unit once, or you can move some units multiple times, but the distance per move rapidly decreases as a unit is moved more times in a single turn. You also get a tank, which is powerful but slow and costs double points to move. While moving a unit, all enemies in range will be constantly firing at it, which lends a sense of urgency to your actions but turns off players who want time to look around and plan carefully. But since they only fire at the unit currently moving (or not at all if out of range/sight), this makes unrealistic and suicidal tactics valuable.  This ties into one of the main complaints against the game. In order to get the best rank (and therefore the most experience and money), you must focus on speed alone, and this requires those same unrealistic, suicidal rush tactics. Trying to follow the normal rules of squad combat will get generally get you a middling rank. You either have to give up hope of getting good ranks or give up the normal rules of combat and strategy. Some people hate that, but despite what some say the game never becomes impossible due to your troops falling behind since you can always play/grind skirmishes to level up. And you only get 50% more XP for an A rank compared to a C rank, so even if you stick to normal tactics you won't need too much grinding. Other ways that the game is unrealistic include 'magical' cover whereby a crouching enemy is 4x as hard to kill even if you flank them and a prone enemy is 8x as hard to kill. But it works just as well for you. The way I see it, you can embrace the fact that the game has unusual rules and try to form new strategies to win within them, or you can use normal strategies and consider getting A ranks to be a bonus minigame that you can play later if you want.  Other gameplay annoyances include dirty tricks where tough enemies and bosses may instantly spawn in the middle of or surrounding your men, even during your turn, and if you aren't prepared they might wipe you out. You may have no choice but to restart or reload and plan for their appearance.  The game lasts about 40-50 hours and includes a New Game+ mode. There's a good variety of mission types and maps. I never felt like the missions got repetitive. There are also two mini campaigns that you unlock after beating the game, which focus on different characters and change things up a bit.  The AI is really bad. It wastes about half of its command points, and generally relies on superior numbers and the fact that it almost always starts the mission holding all the good defensive positions.  As for the story, it's passable. I might even have called it good if it wasn't for the fact that it's full of bad cliches. There are also annoying points of incongruity in the game world. When characters can take a tank shell in the face and survive, and all wounds however grievous can be healed instantly with a touch of ragnaid, it feels very contrived when they suddenly become weak and helpless during cutscenes when the writers want to kill them off. And everyone just stands around crying rather than applying some ragnaid. It makes no sense, which robs those scenes of emotive power. Nonetheless, the story did its job of giving me a reason to keep fighting, and parts of it are interesting and moving.  The graphics are nice, although not up to PC standards. You can set the resolution to whatever you want, but in many cases it seems like the game internally renders at a fixed resolution and then upscales, so it's blocky no matter how high you set the resolution. The artsy rendering style is nice and mostly convincing. However, it's very 'cute', which might be a bit of a turn-off for some people. You're putting skinny teen and pre-teen anime girls in the field and they're killing people and then making cute girly poses. The whole game is a bit silly, but it didn't bother me.  The sound effects are good and the music is decent. The game includes both Japanese and English audio, which I appreciate.  The controls are buggy, especially if you play with a keyboard and mouse. There are weird, framerate-dependent bugs with the keyboard which might or might not affect you. I'd recommend using a gamepad like an XBox 360 controller instead, plus the mouse for aiming, but even then there are annoying bugs such as the game failing to filter out jitter and bounce in the analog sticks. (Depending on your gamepad, the cursor may sometimes become uncontrollable with the analog stick, but you can always use the D-pad.)  The user interface is kind of annoying. It's clearly a straight console port and no effort was made to improve it for the PC. For instance, even if you choose to use the keyboard in the configuration program, the game starts up and says 'Press START button'. There's no mouse support in menus. Etc. You also can't skip the many little boost cutscenes in battle, and while they're usually nice, sometimes they're tiring. The worst is that often they're totally unnecessary, like an anti-tank boost activating (with cutscene) when you're not shooting at a tank, or a healing boost when you're already at full health. Those are just a waste of time.  Overall, I enjoyed the game and thought it was worth the price. It has its flaws, but they're outweighed by the many fun aspects.",

Overall, it's a very good purchase, *especially* with such a good price tag - the game is old, so it's not sold for as much anymore, but it has very honestly lost nothing in gameplay or looks in its age.  The singular complaint I would bring up is that there are a few missions (spread out across the whole game) that are *absurdly*, stupidly more difficult and obnoxious than the rest of the game, and usually because of the same, ridiculous opponent showing up in the battle. In order to win, you're forced to abruptly use new strategies and mechanics that, until that mission, didn't exist and couldn't be used, and upon reaching the level are inadiquately explained and poorly utilized. It's very much a slap in the face, both in terms of the immersion and flow of the game, and also in terms of the enjoyment you get out of it. To put it bluntly: those missions will not be fun, and they may even ruin the game for some people. And that's very sad, because apart from those levels, the game is absolutely wonderful. So, frankly, when you hit those levels, cheat, save-scum, whatever; just get past them, then get back to enjoying this really truly amazing game.",
