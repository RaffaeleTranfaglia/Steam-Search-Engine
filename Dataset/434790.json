            "review_text": "Should be an Early Access title because of all the glitches. Collision detection messes up a lot and the AI is really bad. It's also incredibly basic. Maybe if they spent some time fleshing it out it would be ok but right now it feels more like a phone game.  Go play Battlezone instead. I think that game came out in the 90s haha",
