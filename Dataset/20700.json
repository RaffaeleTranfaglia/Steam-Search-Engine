Sort of like Sinistar (minus the ridiculous difficulty level) where you get to customize and upgrade your ship over time. You really have two ships. The 'mother' ship is also customizeable and upgradeable, but just the single hull and it will come to your aid and fight/mine as well.  Now I really want to create the sequel to this game :) Or play it.",

Fun story: I actually played the demo of this waaay back when it first came out. At the same time as Massive Assault (which as we all know is a game I absolutely love). I really wanted to get it back then, so I got it on Steam when I heard it existed. While it's not that great a game, I have zero regrets on the matter!",

(lots of players per server, 'till the very end, and that game was OLD - the days of dial-up. Beat that.) Well, this game feels a bit similar to that and Asteroids - fly around in a spaceship, blow up asteroids, and like in SubSpace, collect stuff to make your ship cooler. But in this, you collect minerals from the asteroids and enemy capital ships with a tractor beam, and you can only hold so much before you have to drop it off in the hangar. To actually make stuff out of it, you have to do some R&amp;D - research better stuff, then actually build it. Both actions take minerals, and there's only so many minerals per area. And they don't come back. Thankfully we have a dangerous zone with infinite resources. *gulp* Oh, and this will play on pretty much anything. Woo!",
