Pros: -No demanding system requirements -Ability to play short/long games offline(local player with friends) or online as well and many tournaments and cups -Intuitive and not hard to learn (but it is tricky to master all the game mechanics, which in my opinion is good) -No referee/penalties/stamina/injuries/team tactics etc. -Less bugs than FIFA -Cheaper than FIFA -Better than FIFA  Cons: - Large room for improvement in the online multiplayer  This game should be well known in all the world because I got tired of FIFA and PES that every year change some players in the teams, polish a bit the mechanics and then sell the game for the same price of the previous year. Devs u deserve a CAKE!",

It reminds me of my early Amiga Sensible Soccer in its friendly gameplay, with a modern cartoonish design both in graphics and gameplay.  I only played a few rounds but can already tell you I am really satisfied with the experience. This is a really neat game that undoubtly deserves you try it if you arrived on its store page. ",

However, If you intend on playing this game online, DO NOT BUY because it is impossible to play with friends do to input delays.  Would not recommend if you want to play online.",
