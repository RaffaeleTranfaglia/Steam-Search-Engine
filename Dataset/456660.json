At first glance, I can't tell if this is a retro throwback, a roguelike or some adventure with no plot/story but it clearly doesn't work at all.   Each time you die you have to go back through the boring vertical slime corridors, then back onto blowing up or attempting to blow up giant slimes with bombs, its boring through-out, has clipping issues and sprite collision is iffy too.   I honestly recommend either scrapping this, or re-making it. Roguelikes or Roguelites, are perhaps the hardest games to make - the balance between frustration and playablity is key, and that line between them is very fine.  ",

            "review_text": "  I recieved this game from a giveaway and it's... interesting. It isn't deep at all and it gets repetative fast but still has a charm to it. It controls moderatly well and the skills as you level up actually have a sense of progression to them. The key binding is only 'secret' past the first screen- after that it is simple to find what you need. You can't expect much for the price, but what there is is at least good as most cheap mobile apps.",
