            "review_text": "I know I'm probably not the only person who will try this game because of the premise, knowing full well that platformers and jumping puzzles isn't a strong point of mine. I can say that this will be, at times, so rage-inducing that it takes you right out of the amazing premise. I want to like this so badly, but spend more time angry than admiring the experience.  As mentioned before - platformers and jumping puzzles are a complete challenge for me. It's not helped by the fact that the jump button doesn't always behave as intended (or, sometimes, at all) when moving/jumping simultaneously, and there are some blade deaths I really want to call 'BS' on - and if I was better at this kind of game I might be able to overcome those glaring issues. I have died 200+ times, averaging almost 15 per level, though a couple levels make up for 50+ each. I'm not sure I'll be able to finish (my profile says something like fourteen hours, it's been less than half that so far, I have a bad habit of letting things run in the background). This is a fault of mine. I just kind of hoped a game about social anxiety would be more approachable across the board, and more of an artistic expression of that kind of life (which I live), but I can't sit back and enjoy that as it's simply in a form that is impossible for me to enjoy, despite trying really hard to grind through it. I *want* to recommend the game, and do, because I know the shortcomings are mine - but I have to rate this from the perspective of other people who may be more like me than the other reviewers - curiosity-seekers thinking of taking a risk on gameplay that isn't for them because they struggle with the game's main themes and want to see that reflected in a game.

            "review_text": "Best game concept ever!  The idea of the dual world is awesome and the implementation is even more awesome.   The levels are not hard but rather a challenge. The campaign is not too long, but the workshop levels will occupy you for a while. The built-in level editor is a great thing too.   You must buy it. The devs deserves it!",

            "review_text": "I've played enough platformers to be frustrated and bored with the genre overall, and I find that Sym does something different that really made me enjoy it. Maybe it's because I have a history of emotional/mental health problems, and I can connect with delving deep into your mind and feelings. A game, especially a platformer, that can evoke emotion or even in a way simulate the feeling of being lost in your mind and feelings, is not something you find *too* often. The game is simple enough, imo, to not get too frustrating.   I don't absolutely love keyboard controls, but that's easy enough to fix with a gamepad emulator (joy2key or x360ce).  Between a story that is designed to evoke thought/feelings and a good amount of levels, as well as the editor/level sharing feature, this definitely gets a 'yes' recommendation from me. This game will stick with me for sure.  ",
