            "review_text": "CotN is a beautiful city-building game with a slight twist -- instead of 'walkers' who go out and follow roads around town to distrubute their wares, most of your people take time out to run to the market when they need things (you can follow the individuals out, going through their day, and it's kind of entertaining in itself). The game itself is pretty laid back and peaceful feeling, and the music is quite nice, too. My one complaint would be that sometimes, when you select a person roaming around town, they say something utterly anachronistic and stupid, and I find that detracts from the overall mood of the game. Turn that off, and you're golden.",

            "review_text": "There are plenty of historical city-builders, but only two set in ancient Egypt that I know of. One is Pharaoh, an off-shoot of the classic Caesar series, and this is the other. Now over a decade old, Children of the Nile gave players the freedom to build great cities and earn prestige on vast maps, with a detailed citizen simulation that rivaled that of the Tropico series. It may be showing its age, but there's plenty more reasons to take a look at it besides it being nearly the only game in town.  In Children of the Nile, you are Pharaoh, absolute ruler of your little patch of desert. From your palace you order the construction of homes and shops, direct the tasks of your citizens, and seek to raise your own prestige. That first point turns out to be blessedly easier than in most city-builders, because this game has a distinct lack of currency or building materials. Most homes are completely free to grant space to, and you need only wait for the residents to move in from whatever uncivilized village they've been grubbing around in. Basic shops and services are also free, and any key buildings beyond that require only a small amount of bricks to erect.  Right from the get-go, then, you are completely open to build and expand as you see fit. There ARE resources, of course, but the important ones are very easy to keep track of. Your most basic resource is food, which feeds your people and is used in your civic buildings as a sort of currency. The peasant class farms food for you automatically, but are limited in number by how many nobles you have. And your nobles are limited only by your ability to provide them services, most of which cost you additional food. This simple balance keeps the game on a steady pace of expansion, where you're never really limited by resources and would really have to go out of your way to foul up.  As you expand you'll start to run across the more granular resources, everything from papayrus reeds to obsidian quarries. Your shops need access to raw materials to make goods, and the most complex construction projects like statues and pyramids require special stone. As I mentioned, Children of the Nile operates much like Tropico where each citizen is modeled and must go about their day in real-time. This could threaten to cause bottlenecks and catastrophic failures as it does in the earlier Tropicos, but here your citizens have generous ranges of travel and stay focused on their tasks. You'll still run into some folks too busy or lazy to go pray or shop, but the consequences of irritating your citizens is very mild and usually easily rectified.  There are dozens of buildings and services to construct, from temples to courts to tombs, and in most scenarios you'll need to make the most of all of them. Key to the progression systems is Prestige, a measure of how respected your Pharaoh is. Prestige is needed to recruit more educated workers, key positions like priests and overseers, and is earned by constructing grand buildings and decorations, winning military victories, and other exploits. Prestige can also degrade over time and you lose some when your Pharaoh passes on, so it's an element that requires constant attention. Usually the paths to earning Prestige in a given scenario are obvious, and the rest of the game is relaxed enough that you'll have plenty of time to focus on your fortune and glory.  I did mention military victories and other exploits, because Children of the Nile is not content to give you just one plot of land to lord over. You also have a world map that shows all of Egypt and the surrounding lands, with points of interest marked. For a cost of food, envoys, and other resources, you can open new trade routes, set up labor camps for resources not found on your map (very useful for the limestone needed for pyramids), and attack barbarian encampments. Combat on the world map requires no interaction, you just send troops like resources, but in harder scenarios you may be attacked and will need to raise and outfit an army. It's a pretty sizable undertaking but again there's no real combat to speak of, your soldiers automatically seek out and destroy invaders.  You'll find plenty to do in each of the game's 15 scenarios, for the maps are enormous and offer multiple locations that would suit a city. Resources are also scattered liberally so you're never really tied to a single spot except in the case of quarries. All of this is rendered in some chunky but serviceable 3D, complete with shadows and rising Nile waters, but the graphics are really where the game shows its age. Your cities can easily grow into huge, sprawling affairs that are hard to parse without the modern accoutrements of depth of field and fluid camera controls. The sound design still holds up at least, with plenty of quaint sound effects and little dialogue quips from your citizens. As long as the dated graphics don't throw you off this is a fantastically interesting and chill builder that's easy to get into and hard to put down.",

It operates on a relatively small scale that helps you understand the settlement's workings without a barrage of information and clutter, but also puts you in touch with your little Egyptian dudes. I'm no expert on the genre, but I've never gotten a better sense of a living, breathing place than I have in Children of the Nile.",

While there is technically warfare in this game, it is limited to an occasional half-dozen 'soldiers' roaming through your lands and getting intercepted by your guards' AI, or looting a home and bugging out. The greater focus of this game is steadily progressing your various wealth classes to bigger and better productivity. The end goal of most of the scenerios is having enough excess good to make deals with your neighbors, some of which are readily available, some of which require you to plan out long-range mining camps.  All done at a relatively low-key, relaxing pace.",

The history is there, I like all of the features of the game, and the way the town has to be made is logical. The gathering of resources could not have been done any more correctly and I really like making all these pyramids for no good reason at all! I like the graphics, the music (though I turned it off in favour of my own music), and the whole mechanics of the game. I did not however, like the many bugs present in the game. People get stuck between buildings trying to go past them, which is VERY annoying, sometimes the workers just dont do what you want them to do; for example I wanted to store basalt for a later project and it turned out that I can only mine basalt if Im going to immediately use it. wth.  But conclusively, I recommend this game, its great fun and has a relatively good tutorial which can be followed, not to mention all the awesome decorations you can put up ^_^",

It simplifies things that shouldn't be simplified and turns concepts abstract that really needs to be spelled out.  The abstract resource gathering system and the almost absent transportation system makes learning how to play the game entirely trial and error. And that just doesn't work in this genre.  Graphically the game is very poor and you'll often find yourself having to zoom in as far as you can to find out what your people are doing and often just to select them.  The games only positive is that there really aren't that much competition in the city builder genre so if you're a fan, you really don't have much of an option other than to try out Children of the Nile.  A truly mediocre game and not really worth your money.",
