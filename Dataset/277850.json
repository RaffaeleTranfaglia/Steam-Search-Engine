            "review_text": "Through rigorous study and experimentation, a group of friends and I have confirmed that Sportsfriends is statistically MUCH more fun than the following:  Farting into coffee cans and then releasing them into the wild,   Sliding down stairs on couch cushions,   Eating baby-back spare ribs,   Shredding the 'gnar,'   Pooping for sport,   Pooping for recreation,   Consuming Doritos and Surge whilst playing THPS,   Getting jiggy with 'it,'   Pooping for recreational sport,   Getting some of your chocolate in my peanut butter,   Organized professional baby wrestling,  and betting on celebrity overdoses.  More studies will be conducted now that the full game is out. Sources and data can be provided upon formal request. Except the baby wrestling data. The cops took those, along with our little tiny wrestling ring. ",
