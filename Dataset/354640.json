After an update I wasn't able to load the game anymore and as so many players before me, I had to make the decision to leave the Steam account and think about playing in Chrome.  Not a decision someone wants to make after putting a lot of effort, patience and joy in an account.   Still, the game meets my requirements when thinking how Settlers Online would be. After a lot of years playing, this gives a significant value to the game.",

That said, however, the game can be rewarding for those who manage to find a helpful guild that is genereous with resources and what not. Needless to say, your journey to the maximum level will not be that of a drag with a constant influx of staple building materials, weapons and food. In the end, though, if this genre, browser based strategy mmos that is, doesn't hold your attention or interest or engages you in any meaningful manner then don't try it out, period.   Despite the monsterously long building/recruiting/forging and making food queues I give this game 7.4 out of 10 relative to other games in the same genre.   P.S. The community is simply amazing, though.  Cheers!",

            "review_text": "Boring, boring, boring.  This is a less shameful version of games like Dungeon Keeper Mobile: a 'free-to-wait' game. My entire time spent in the game was either waiting for a timer to finish counting down or navigating a menu. There were no clear objectives, no stakes, no intrigue, and no challenge.  XCOM: Enemy Unknown had the tutorial done and the objectives set in less than 5 minutes, even shorter if you took the option to skip the opening tutorial. Battle Nations, an example of what I consider to be a free-to-wait game actually done correctly, handed you a battle to fight it out while you built up your resources and troops to take on a looming threat, all the while the premium currency can be earned and is entirely optional for one to have.  But this game? Nothing. Just 'build buildings, stockpile resources'. If one were to take out the timers, then this game might have a chance at building up a decent pacing. As it stands, I was falling asleep and I wasn't even a half-hour into it.  The only good thing I can say about it is that during said time I wasn't badgered into spending money on premium currency. But I have a feeling that this may have changed had I trudged further in.",

            "review_text": "A completely linear gameplay of watching time counters diminish, only to get to wait for another one. The only variety is getting to wait for the tools to replenish to continue the waiting. The game is made with f**king Flash and thus everything is unresponsive as hell to click on. Also, quests frequently glitch so that a completed quest does not let you claim the quest rewards. Also, there are the usual buyable diamond in-game currency and PVP rankings just like in every Chinese style cheap cash-in game. For every penny you put into this game, shame on you. Shame. P.S. The original Settlers games are slow, repetitious and neolithic, though at least they don't practically force you to build buildings in a certain order by heavily rationing and restricting the given resources and building options from the get-go. In short, somehow this game is borderline playable despite being based on an okay game franchise. Don't waste your time with this piece of garbage.",

Nothing wrong with being a browser game, but the freemium premise kills the entire game for me. If you want to play the game at an acceptable pace, you will be forced to pay. Even at low levels, you need to wait for minutes until a building is complete. Don't dish out your well earned cash for this money pit, buy the old Settlers games!
