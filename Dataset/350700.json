            "review_text": "This game gets a very negative feedback from me for the problems I have experienced trying to log in. First the game client crashes when you try to log in if you are not in administrative mode. Something I can easily deal with and hindred only the first launch. Then came the log on creation where I went to the website only to be bombarded several times by 'DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT' screen, after I was already making a new account. That annoyed me but still did not hinder me. So, after doing all this, I still could not log in game itself as it didn't recognize my username/password. It also seemed to bug out every third or so login attempt.   Finally, and what took the cake is this 'X-Trap'. This horrid horrid game protection is actually not really protection. It prevents typing outside the game screen. This seems to include steam related screens. How this got past being greenlit, I will never understand. Oh, and to top it off, there is no wiki for this game. The wikis are completely unfurbished or barely have anything other than copied text from the website over at GamenGame.  In short, if you have the patience, the luck, and the mashocist attitude to play this, go ahead. But for a casual gamer like myself, I say stay away~",

Choose from many classes to suit your own taste (i chose Maid to play) and the community here is friendly. (found GMs at main place and training centre to help newbies) Well i recommend! 8/10",

Reaching all the way up to level 999, the possibilities for playstyles within just one class are nearly limitless. If you're looking for a great game with low computer requirements, this may be the game for you. It plays similar to ARPGs like Diablo in the sense that you move via mouse clicks, instead of the popular WASD fashion.   Players can join guilds, form parties, and explore content together or alone.  Overall, this game has a solid 8.75 from me, only losing points due to the somewhat poor translations on things. Definitely pick this game up and at least give it a try.  The only other qualm aside from translations that I have, is that after a certain point, it tends to require a bit of money to level efficiently.(Buying a Portal Sphere, often referred to as 'Prem'.)",
