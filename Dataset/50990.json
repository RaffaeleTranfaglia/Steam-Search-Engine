            "review_text": "Circa 2006, now here is a Hidden Object (HO) game that stands the test of time. This is the third game in the Mystery Case Files series which is one of the longest running hidden object series there is with 13 games as of Aug, 13, 2016. (5 are direct Ravenheart games, with 2 'spinoff' games (Madame Fate) and 1 tie-in (Dire Grove, Sacred Grove) to the Ravenhearst saga). But enough history - so love it or hate it, this is still one of best Hidden Object games on the market today. Old school it may be but this game was also one the first HO games to actually use a storyline.  Storyline: In 1894, a young Emma Ravenhearst arrives in Blackpool, England to begin a teaching career. She meets a dashing young man by the name of Charles Dalimar. He proposes to her and builds a manor house naming it Ravenhearst in her honor. In present day there is a mystery surrounding this woman, Emma Ravenhearst and the manor built in her honor. The Queen of England, yes really the Majesty herself, sends an incomplete and torn diary to you, the Mystery Detective (from Huntsville - 1st game), with the directive to find Emma's diary pages and solve the mysterious happenings surrounding Ravenhearst Manor. Spoilers if I said more since 1/4 of the game is piecing (quite literally) the torn diary pages back together and reading Emma's life as it unfolds.   Gameplay: As I said before: OLD SCHOOL. The hidden object scenes, 30 plus, is a room within the manor or a place around the manor (a porch, 3 floors inside the manor, a tower, basement, cellar, shed, treehouse, garden, etc). The scenes could be considered repetitive though the list find objects within the scene change with each new diary page chapter. This repetitiveness is a GOOD thing since each diary page chapter is TIMED. The initial time to solve a diary page chapter starts at 45 minutes but decreases in time to 30 minutes or less depending on the diary page chapter difficulty. Fortunately the scene itself does not scramble the objects, so rote learning of where the list find objects are helps as the overall time decreases. TIME DECREASES as more diary pages are found and assembled, and the AMOUNT OF OBJECTS needed to be found INCREASES. (Go repetitiveness of room scenes and the objects staying put where found last.) Each diary page chapter ends with an actually piece together 'jigsaw' puzzle. The diary page has been torn to bits and must be reassembled, all within the time limit. Each illustrated pencil drawn page tells the on-going story of Emma and her ultimate fate.   A few words about the scenes and list find objects: Charles is an EXTREME hoarder. Every scene is jammed packed with items (100s of items) and the player must find only 8-10 objects in each scene. There are truly no unfairly hidden items there are simply 100s of them to sort through and the graphics, at least on my computer are comparable to the game I already own. Each diary page chapter increases the overall amount of items needed to be found up to somewhere around 64 items in 30 minutes in about 8 different scenes. (forgive the math, it is not accurate just using the numbers as an example). Fortunately the player does not have to find everything generally there are 2 or more objects in every diary page chapter that do not need to be found.  A word of ... warning about the find objects. Looking for a plane now that could be a wood plane (a carpenter's tool) or an airplane which could a jumbo jet, a toy, a decal or a paper airplane. Compass is another one, I recommend looking for a drafting compass first (that metal 'V' looking thing with a pencil attached) before the round object with North and South. The list find objects may or may not have more then one meaning to them. Also for anyone born after say 1995 they may or may not recognize some of the find list items, like reel (which is a film reel), or phone (land line phones - can one even buy those anymore?) or even camera (since most things are now all digital on a cellphone). Just thought I would warn everyone.   The find objects as I stated before do not move randomly about in the scene fortunately. However the player will get a few new objects to find in previously played scenes or simply new scenes to play as the game progresses. Keep in mind as the game progresses the TIMER is getting less and less minutes on it, so knowing where find objects are is wonderful.   Now a little spoiler besides being a mega-hoarder Charles has a hobby of creating some very intricate and puzzling locks on some doors. These are the scenes that have a key hole on them. I recommend looking for and starting with these keyhole scenes because these intricate, complex locks are puzzles. I call them master puzzles. These master puzzles have NO INSTRUCTIONS and MUST BE figured out from the clues provided somewhere on the puzzle itself. Basically a master puzzle is a bunch of little puzzles that form a much bigger and more complex puzzle all with the intent to find the 'key' that opens the door. Remember solving these lovelies are part of the overall TIME which is why I recommend doing them first or one can skip them at the cost of 5 minutes.  Here are some examples of the types of mini-puzzles found on a master puzzle lock: 1) Need 5 batteries - oh that upside down sign says 'all on', board above has little light bulbs all off, pull the lever and some of the lights turn on, now click on the lights to get them to all turn on, repeat until there are enough batteries. 2) Need to 2 eggs, the boot behind the chicken kicks it when the lever is pulled making the chicken nose dive into an empty feed dish, no feed, no egg, no egg to solve the colored egg puzzle below which opens the door. So where is the feed, oh above the chicken but which of the 3 feeds or combination of the 3 feeds is needed? Look for clues. And this why I recommend starting with the master lock puzzles.   Last paragraph I promise. The End Game, and of course it is timed, 30 minutes to be exact. Object find 7 keys scattered throughout Ravenhearst and solve the final master lock puzzle. Does not sound hard until one has to search through about 15 hoard filled rooms or places looking for a single key which may or may not be in that particular scene. Fortunately the game helps a bit with that and once all the keys are found in that area (1st floor, outside, attic, etc) the area can not be assessed anymore limiting the search. Then there is the end game master lock puzzle - no hints, no instructions, and NO SKIPPING. If the player runs out of time, the game scrambles the keys into new locations and the player starts again. (Actually at any point in the game if the player runs out of time, that diary page chapter starts from the beginning of that chapter.) Do remember repetitive scenes and repetitive non-moving list objects in that scene are a bonus to the player especially when trying to beat the clock timer.   Highly recommend, especially as a change of pace from the point and click, mini-game, hand-holding, hidden object games of today.  PS I own every single Mystery Case File game there is and have played them multiple times. For those interested: Any Mystery Case File not found on Steam can be found on the Big Fish Games website. And thank you BFG for bringing this series to Steam.   PSS I even know where the BFG logo is hidden in this game. : )",
