However I stuck with it and ended up really enjoying it. The visuals in this game are amazing alone, and masterfully done.    There are some minor thing I would recommend users tweak that I found helped considerably.  **The Good**  * Amazing Visuals. * Deep and interesting story line * Good replay value, there is a lot to explore and search through out the BioShock infinite world.  **Needs Improvment**  * Visibility of enemies is very poor, I recommend either using SweetFX or turning up digital vibrance. * Player movments are very 'blocky' with the stock configuration, I found out this was caused by 'autoaim' being forced on. There is a config tweak to modify this:   Browse to C:\\Users\\YOURUSERACCOUNTNAME\\Documents\\My Games\\BioShock Infinite\\XGame\\Config Open XUserOptions.ini with notepad or wordpad Find the line called 'bAimAssist=True' and change it to 'bAimAssist=False     **Overall Rating ** 9.5 / 10",

A couple of days ago, I just decided to load it up, and I can confidently say it's my favorite single player game of all time. Though some have criticized the gunplay, I found it very enjoyable, and the vigors were a blast. But, the world building and story is where this gem shines. With only having a vague understanding of the first Bioshock, I was able to follow the story without any confusion, well, except for the confusion the game wanted me to have. Fully recommended.",

            "review_text": "This is a game that desperately makes you want to think it's smart when it has no idea what it's talking about and knows jack about it's own subject matter. The combat is limiting and repetitive with a two weapon limit with an expensive as hell upgrade system. The 'Vigors' (plasmids with a new coat of paint) all do the same thing with three exceptions: Possess machines for a short period of time (Not the same as hacking from Bioshock 1), charge at enemies with a strong melee attack (comes with a certain upgrade that makes it stupidly overpowered so you'll probably not use anything else), and an ability to catch and reflect bullets (would have been pretty cool if it wasn't given to you at practically the last part of the game), all other Vigors are just the same crowd control effect with a different look.  The story doesn't save the game either. In the beginning it tries to send a message about racial equality and revolution but that's thrown away in favor of theories about alternate-dimensions/realities (which don't make any sense at all the second you start thinking about them).  Also;   why did they feel like they needed to have a twist ending in Infinite? Just because the first game had one? They also did it in Infinite's DLC. Are twist endings now a staple for this series? Do they understand how a twist ending is supposed to work? A twist only works if the audience isn't expecting it, just by making your series the 'Series with twist endings in them' you're ruining the surprise because people will be expecting it. That's what made the twist in Bioshock work, the game gave everyone enough hints towards the twist without giving it away; no one was expecting it. In Infinite the twist is not hinted at at all, I played the game twice just to make sure I missed something but any actual hints towards the big reveal were extremely vague.    It's only 12 hours long but many areas felt like unnecessary padding. The ending is 20 minutes long and it's whole purpose is to provide an explanation to many of the mysteries in the game, but it fails. Not only are many questions left unanswered, many more questions are raised. They try to explain most mysteries with alternate dimensions and quantum physics which ends up not making any sense. On a sunnier note, Columbia as a setting was pretty cool, but I honestly think this is the only thing the game truly has going for it.  Wait a minute that card/10",

I don't want to go into the plot too much as it's very interesting to discover yourself. So, on to the review.  Infinite was a great game. Very Bioshocky, very fun. It is not a 10/10 game. This is hype. I'm sorry, but it just is not. It's an incredibly well made game with interesting plot and game mechanics and twists, but I expected more out of the reviews provided.   8/10 on a realistic chart, even 9/10 at a stretch. But not 10. It has no 'flaws', just some missed opportunities, a little bit of a lack of fleshing out the narrative fully.   A recommendation from me most definitely. I completed the game in 14 hours, playing on Hard, completing 34/37 Sightseeing and 75/80 Voxophones (which is maybe 95% completion?).  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  Nilesy",

            "review_text": "I am impressed. Impressed by The City in the Sky. After finishing Bioshock and Bioshock 2 I thought nothing can ever compete with the world of Rapture. But then I walked in the streets of Columbia for the first time and it was so peaceful, so beautiful, so incredibly atmospheric.  'There's always a lighthouse. There's always a man. There's always a city..' But still.. these two worlds are so different. In Rapture you were stuck in small rooms with very limited ways to escape. It had its own charm. Columbia is just the opposite. It has many big open areas with the possibility to move fast around by attaching sky-hooks to the city's main transport system Sky-Line.  Bioshock Infinite story is, without doubt, one of the best ever made for a game. It tells you the story by showing you things. Do not expect any direct explanation. This part is on you to find out what just really happened.. To put all the pieces together and try to understand.. Fortunately some people already made their explanation and interpretation of this very complicated story and that helps players like me to understand a bit better. And of course it opens more question for discussions.  I have to admit I liked the combat system in previous Bioshocks a bit more. The biggest issue I had was that Bioshock Infinite allowed me to carry only two weapons. Sometimes I felt like I was stuck with what I found around. Upgrading certain weapons didn't feel very satisfying in the end. I never used them as much as I would like to. I was very frequently unsure if I should pick up different weapons around or not, because you never know what will you be facing behind the next corner.  Here comes another But. You can't save your progress in the game. You have to wait for autosave. I understand their intention but it can become a bit annoying when you have to stop playing and next time you can't simply continue from where you were before.  I chose hard difficulty level and it was both, enjoyable and challenging. Despite some of my complaints the fights were still very decent.  To be honest all the negative things I experienced were washed away by the impressive graphics and story. I took some time away from the game before writing this review. My mind was struck and paralyzed by the very emotional and confusing ending.  The good feelings still persist. I must recommend this game and then I must continue with the DLCs :)",

Friend has been raving about the series for years to me. I play the first and am blown away by the story. Start the second one and couldn't even get past an an hour into and am thinking total garbage. So the third installment I put on hold for quite awhile. Finally get a wild hair to sit down and play it. It is a very graphical stunning game. I'm a little at a lose on written this review because it's a good game possible a great one with one thing I'm not 100% sold on the story. The story is good but it was completely rushed it starts out slow like the first one that's fine getting your bearings and the lay of the land. But then you hit the action and it's done quicker then a plate of oreos' at a weight watchers meeting. It leaves you wanting more or it does in my opinion. A person could easily finish this game in ten hours just rushing it not exploring or all that jazz. I would feel even more cheap, dirty, and used like a five dollar hooker if I had paid full price for the game. I did not so the feeling passed pretty quickly think I picked up all three and the season pass for idk around $20. The story itself is good but you wish it had a little more detail to it. All in all a good game don't let this review discourage your from purchasing it. And the ending linking up to the Bioshock original wasn't even needed. Love how they did just not fundamental to the story. I would rate this game a 7.5 maybe an 8 but more towards the 7.5 mark. Graphics superbly done. Story I liked it but didn't love it. All in all if your a fan of the first skip the second and purchase this one. If your new to series doesn't matter the order you play them just skip the second and your golden. This game should definitaly be on your wishlist at the very least.",

The game mechanics are excellent, and places it right up with with the best shooters. The thing that puts it a cut above the others is its narrative, which, as is true of all geat works of science fiction, is well written, keeps you guessing, and gives you plenty of concepts and ideas to try to wrap your mind around.  For those who don't care about a litterary tour de force with lots of brain food included, there's still plenty here to hold one's interest. Along the way one will find articles of clothing imbued with powers, vigors (essentially spells), and weapons. The weapons and vigors have upgrade paths, but upgrading costs money, and money is limited, so one must carefully pick and choose. It's next to impossible to get every upgrade in the game. To do so one must find every silver eagle in the game and never get killed, and have a little luck on top of it all.  If you do not already have this game I strongly recommend getting it, for it is destined to become a classic, and perhaps a rare multi-generational one too.",

            "review_text": "Rating 9/10 Overview: First Person Shooter   The Good:  + As is the case with every Bioshock game proceeding this one, the world, setting and atmosphere is the main attraction and this game is no different. The city of Columbia is beautiful and one of the most interesting and unique game settings to play in.   + Graphically both artistically and technically this game is gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking games on PC to date.   + The story is fantastic dealing with major themes such as racism, morality, religion and faith. A game that should leave a lasting impression on you long after you finish it.   + Elizabeth one of the main NPC's is incredibly helpful in and out of combat, providing you with health, ammo, money etc. The developers did a great job making her realistic and helpful and not a hindrance.   + The game introduces vigors (identical to plasmids from previous Bioshock games) that give you special powers such as charging enemies, shocking, possessing etc that give you an advantage in combat.  + Plenty of weapons/vigors to fit your play style. You can charge in and blast your enemies with shotguns or stay back and snipe with a sniper rifle.   + The game introduces skylines for you to ride on adding an extra gameplay element to combat. You can jump on and off the the skylines at will to either attack enemies from above or to escape a potentially dangerous situation.   +The three pieces of DLC are very enjoyable. Clashes in the Clouds is a horde mode across 4 levels and 15 waves each. The goal obviously is to survive each wave and if possible complete the bonus objective. Burial at Sea part 1 and 2 tie in the story of Infinite with the events of the first game. Although the story may be a bit contrived in doing so it was still nice to revisit Rapture from a different point of view. Each episode introduces some new gameplay elements. The first episode being more action oriented while the second being more stealth oriented.   + Great music and sound  Average  - Other than the inclusion of skylines the gunplay introduces nothing new. You can also only carry 2 weapons at one time which feels very limiting compared to the previous games.   - Throughout the game you will find pieces of equipment for you to wear. You can equip a total of 4 pieces. The problem is the vast majority of equipment you find is terrible and offers little to no value. The few that are good can really break the game. There is no balance.    -The last gameplay segment is uninspiring. I got the feeling the developers ran out of time/creative ideas.  Conclusion  You really have to love the world, story and characters to really appreciate this game. If you play it solely for the gameplay you may find yourself a tad disappointed. I personally loved the game I only wish the world was more open ended for me to explore at my own pace. ",

            "review_text": "BioShock Infinite, yet another game in the beloved BioShock series. Or is it? The game is set in the year 1912. Booker Dewitt accepts a job to travel to Columbia, a city suspended in the air, in order to retrieve a girl (Elizabeth) and wipe away his 'debts'. I don't know how much else I can say without spoiling some bits, so I'll just get right into the review. You see, Inifinite not only has a different setting. It's very, very different to the first two games, in fact. So different to the point where one could easily say that it's just a game that only has a different, original setting (as well as some lovely throwback references to the series) in common with it's franchise. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and find it to be a great addition. The game itself is fantastic. The story was good, combat was quite good, the setting was fantastic and I found myself enjoying the characters (Elizabeth, The Lutece Twins and Songbird were probably my favourites. Yes, even Songbird). One who tries to play this game as if it were the original BioShock (or the second) will not do too well. This game is more of an open-ish world shooter with large areas to move around while in combat. As well as this, the player can utilize Columbia's transport system (Sky-Lines, metal lines that one can traverse with a grappeling hook) to fight foes and move around the city. It's a cool feature in general. When watching the game be played, the main fear I had was that Elizabeth would be constantly forced as a character I desperately needed to care about. While this is true in some respects, I didn't neccesarily find her overbearing. In fact, I began to enjoy her company as well as the character throughout the game. That being said, though, she definitely isn't a companion; more of a follower. One thing to note is that you can no longer carry more than two weapons. Apparently the downloadable-content 'Burial at Sea' allows this once again as the player returns to the city of Rapture but since this is about the main game I'll just say it's a bit of a letdown. I'm not thrilled that the change was made, but it's not something I believe you should focus on. Another thing to note is that the little 'boss' characters that the character finds throughout the game aren't utilized very well. I find that they're nowhere near as memorable as the Big Daddy characters that the player encounters in the first game. It's a letdown indeed. That brings me onto another topic; Plasmids. Plasmids, or 'Vigors' as they are now called, just aren't as memorable as the ones you encounter in Rapture. On top of that, I only found myself using two or three of them on a regular basis compared to the first two games where I would use a wide variety. To sum it up, this is a good game that should keep you occupied. If you're one who likes to play through games multiple times once you get it I'm sure this could keep you entertained for a while. That being said, I still can't overcome my biased attitude towards the first game in the series and would definitely reccommend that, if you're willing to pay for this game, you at least consider getting the first one as well.

BioShock Infinite serves as an excellent addition to the BioShock franchise and if I must say, has become my favorite game of the series. It's a game that has an excellent story, interesting and loveable characters, amazing settings, and more. With the previous two games having both taken place in the underwater city of Rapture, it's nice to see this game take a departure from there and instead, having it take place a completely brand new, different setting, which is the floating city of Columbia. I also enjoyed the game's soundtrack and as well, was taken in by the graphics of the game. It isn't the top of the line realism graphics, but graphics that I find to be quite beautiful. And then there's Elizabeth! She has to be one of my favorite companions of any game. I could honestly go on about her for ages, but in short, she's a character I easily grew to love and who has a very interesting personality, as well as backstory. As well, a companion who is actually seems real as opposed to a not so smart AI. One of my favorite things of this game though is that the city of Columbia as a whole and it's people, as well as so much of the game taking place in bright settings like outside and such, at first glance, it seems like one of those bright, positive games. While this game does have it's brighter, cheerful moments, underneath all that, at the core, I believe BioShock Infinite to be a darker game, when you consider certain parts of the storyline and such, especially when delving deep into the story. Overall, I've had loads of fun playing this game and think it to be a masterpiece of a game, if I do say so myself. I'd recommend this game to anyone without second thoughts!",

The vigors could be used to add more depth, but mostly all of them are just some sort of stun(so it's easier to shot your enemies!) and even the ones that aren't, are completely non-relevant to the game.  Story wise, it's a really letdown. It introduces nice themes early, just to be dropped two hours later, with convoluted and shallow plot twists. Soundtrack is okay, but quite forgettable.

I wish it has more options to chose from at every moment, so I don't always have to slaughter inhabitants and cause that many deaths indirectly. But all that would make playthrough even longer and mentally staying in Columbia was not pleasant sojourn the deeper I got into its history.  Techically, game is a masterpiece - graphics, level design, enemies AI, user interface - every part of gameplay is amazingly good. As for story, it is something everyone should try to go through and see how long could it take to fix single hasty careless action (won't you agree it is not typical for games?). So, yeah, game is matchless.  More kills per minute and more screnshots made than I could predict.  PS: even though I was trying to thoroughly learn storyline during walkthrough, I was either too dumb or inattentive to understand the story and had to read wiki to make things clear.

It's simple and intuitive, with enemies often dying when you shoot them and a number of other means of murder being thrown into the mix.  Elizabeth, as your sole companion, is probably the greatest side kick you will ever have in a shooter. She doesn't get in the way, doesn't steal your kills, gives you stuff that you need, and obeys your orders without a second thought.  What really makes Infinite shine is its story.

Other stuff:  Being a Christian myself,I was happy to see a piece of media brave enough to question the tendency of humans to follow certain religions blindly without questioning the chaos they cause.The primary antagonist is the perfect portrayal of what a person is capable of doing in the name of religion.I just hope people don't forget that there are actual sensible Christians around but I digress.Kudos for questioning the authority of those with the most selfish of ambitions currently in power.

You play as Booker Dewitt as he travels to said city of Columbia in search of a young woman, Elizabeth, whom he plans to hand over to wipe away a debt he owes; this results in an exciting tale of hardship and intense action.",

Otherwise you may want to read this review to contrast the fanboy fawning from the industry and previous fans of the series.  This is my opinion: BioInf is a beautiful game, with mediocre gameplay where longer healthbars simulate difficulty, and a story that pretends to be deep while it's really mostly pretentious, chopped up, and doesn't 'handle' and of the issues it briefly touches on. I could write you an essay about all the plot flaws; examples being blatantly ignoring huge character events, having Booker act like a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (and I mean extra everything total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ even in game terms) to make the story even more convoluted, and not keeping to their own in-universe laws. They introduce story elements like travel in time and between worlds in the multiverse, but don't seem to take into account the obvious consequences; for example, why does Booker assume that if they pass into a new world, his old deal with someone would be valid over there? And concerning all the deep issues it handles; you get hammered by racism, then all the black people go murderbrawl and you have to mindlessly shoot them all, is that what people mean by the game 'handling big and important issues'?  Now, I don't think BioInf is a worthless game; it can be fun at times. The intro is fantastically beautiful, for example. But if the question is simply: did I think it was worth my time and money spent? then my answer is no. The original idea of this game may have been brilliant, and the story complex and beautiful, but it feels like it's been compromised too many times in development, and consequently can't hold itself together. It may have benefited from not taking up quite so many 'deep and important issues' and not branching out into quite so many things. It ends up trying very hard to be something it isn't: a good story.",

Bioshock Infinite wants to be a game about the nature of 'what-if' and choice, framed in a story about ex-military officer Booker DeWitt sent to a mystical city in the clouds to rescue the mysterious waif Elizabeth, whose strange world-altering powers and sheltered childhood lends itself to an unfolding narrative of mutual cooperation; encouraging the player to care for an NPC as the two of you battle an unjust world out to get you.  What it *is*, is a game about shooting dudes in the face. Lots of them, in hectic combat where you tend to get disoriented a lot and your low health and lack of carriable healing items causes you to run around from cover to cover like a headless chicken looking for that precious popcorn or abandoned soda to boost your all-too-fragile health. And when the red mist is over you are left with a pile of dead police officers and ordinary, well-intentioned people convinced you are a bad guy. Which, after having killed about twenty of them, you kind of sort of feel like. Racists they may be, but nothing in-game ever convinced me these people *needed* to die, and especially not in such crude, gore-tastic manners.  Bioshock Infinite has a real issue with story-and-gameplay integration: The story and presentation leaves me ill-motivated to care about the main characters or anything they do. The gameplay, even if it had been better (it is certainly the weakest of the Bioshock games to date, sacrificing the last vestiges of System Shock on the altar of Call of Duty) creates a sharp divide between the themes of caring for someone and cooperating with them and killing endless hordes of very human cannon fodder with nary a thought; apparently only the hopes and dreams of the main character are worth diving into. Booker's dismissing of practically everything about this magical cloud wonderland he finds himself in, or his refusal to engage in any form of self-reflection about himself or his actions, certainly don't help matters.  In fact, if I may be so bold I might say this game's core excellence is as a showpiece for the ideas promoted by Spec Ops: The Line. Do I feel like a hero yet? No, Bioshock Infinite. No, I do not.",

The environments are gorgeous, and exploring Colombia were rather enjoyable. Also the story was well told and quite moving despite some gaps in continuity. However that's the extent of its positive qualities.  As game it fails to be challenging, even on Hard mode the combat is incredibly trivial. Elizabeth can keep you feed with an infinite supply of ammo, health, and salts, which you don't even need because you can just kill everything with the skyhook. Aside from the combat the game was incredibly linear, with very few secrets, and of those that did exist none really provided any substantial benefit because the combat was so easy to begin with.  And again back to the problems with it being so linear, I can't help but compare it to the first Bioshock, which was also linear, however at least had multiple endings. With Bioshock: Infinite there is one ending, and honestly it's not that good. For a game that has a theme of infinite worlds with infinite possibilities you have only one ending? Really?  To sum it all up it's just not a good game; like I said the story was pretty good, but the combat is poor, and the player cannot change the outcome of the ending. In terms of gameplay it's more like Myst or Riven than a shooter. It's just a beautiful enviornment to explore. However, unlike Myst or Riven, Bioshock: Infinate is devoid of any choice or challenge. Overall I'd have to say that you would probably be better off just watching all the cutscenes on youtube, because it would make a better movie than a game.",

You can swap out your abilities at any time which sounds like fun but it quickly becomes apparent that the differing abilities often amount to the exact same thing. It is far too easy to hide and shoot thru every dang level. As a point of reference and as shooters go? I would still play the first Far Cry over this game.

Most reviews that I see gush over the game's story. Look, I get it: the idea of alternate universes, travel between them, and consequences of choices that can alter future choices is intriguing. Unfortunately, getting to these themes involved introducing multiple, underdeveloped characters that just seemed like more and more names being thrown at you. The games storyline with the revolution and the overall 'alternate universes' theme conflicted and annoyed me for the latter part of the game. Fighting animated patriot machines was... dumb. It seemed like the developers felt they could get away with putting any stupid scenario in the game just because in one of the infinite universes it was possible.

Combat turned from fun to an empty, churny and uninspired chore between story nibblets. It felt like the team lost track of 'fun' 70% or so into the game. As such, the promise the game made with its fantastic first hours turned out to be a huge lie towards the end. The many  many  faults with the nimble-as-a-refridgerator controls were at first totally forgivable, but when everything but the visuals crumbled and came tumbling down around it, the painful dance with those blaring faults were pretty much all that was left. The payoff the game convinced me it could deliver was just reduced to a dirty rag tossed to the side.  Playing on hard can be a real challenge towards the end, but I find that most of my deaths through the game came from getting stuck in basic geometry, the character not running, or simply not jumping to the various hook-spots when he was supposed to. Bioshock Infinite is also a perfect reminder of why enemies using hit-scan weapons in shooters just aren't  fun .  I will try to beat it as I'm most probably just one small hill from the end, just to get it over with, and certainly not because I find it entertaining anymore. I'm actually even rather uninterested by the story at this point, as all the characters decided to just muddle up their believability with just stupid and inconsistent behavior.  It honestly feels like the original team of the game were not, at all, the same people who made the latter hours of it. Weird. Disappointing.   I really wanted to recommend this.

From the story to the combat, I have enjoyed every last second of the Columbia experience. Please don't compare this to previous games with similar titles... and as such I will not compare them in this recommendation. What I will do is explain what I love about Infinite, and if it jives with what you also love in games, then you will enjoy this experience as well.  For one, without any spoilers, the story is tremendous. Not Dickens or Shakespeare, but for Sci-Fi fans who enjoy stories that try to stretch the imagination, this definitely satisfies.   Columbia itself is nicely fleshed-out with a lot of details. It's nice to see a city that is seemingly pleasant until you see the underlying fanaticism and bigotry. It is almost uncomfortable and off-putting, but makes the experience that much more real.  Besides story and setting, the remaining piece would be combat, of which I found quite satisfying. If you're not a fan of bullet-spongy baddies you've definitely come to the wrong place. I played through on Hard the first time, and the game definitely gave me a challenge. With only two weapons to swap between and a limited amount of Salt for Vigors (read Plasmids), I had to be very careful. It was easy to get myself killed by running out into the open; movement and cover is key.   Most of the weapons are satisfying although at first I was a bit confused by the red and blue ammo (each faction has similar weapons with their own sets of ammo); I think subsequent play-throughs I will focus on upgrading a handful of specific ones instead of spreading myself so thin.   As far as Vigors are concerned, I have to admit I enjoyed some more than others. While many where useful, when I eventually got 'Return to Sender' and 'Bucking Bronco', I was in love. There is a good variety of the usual suspects such as fire and electricity, and some interesting combos you can get (and there is an achievement for finding them all if you're into that sort of thing) by say lighting someone on fire and then charging them to create a bunch of fire-bombs that spread throughout the area.   Character building in Infinite is mostly about what weapons you upgrade, what Vigors you buy and upgrade, but also is a little bit about clothing. There are four pieces of clothing Booker can wear, each with its own passive bonus. A lot of the best clothing is found through exploration, so make sure you poke around the levels if you want to find something good. Over time you will find a set of gear that will complement your play style which is especially satisfying.  For me, this is a game that will stay on my hard drive for a long while. I'm not much for clutter, so usually uninstall games after completion. While not as consistently replayable as Borderlands, I certainly expect to go through this story again as well as the two Burial at Sea DLC packs.   If what I've written piques your interest, then go ahead and buy this game. Still unsure? It's old enough that you can find it somewhere online at a discount, so you really don't have much to lose.

Seriously, there is not one gun in the game I do not reflect back upon with utter distain. In the original Bioshock weapon and plasmid upgrades were bought through separate resource pools. But in this game, EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, is bought through the same pool. This means you don't have any room to experiment with the 'Vigor's' (which are just cut &amp; pastes from the older game), and have to invest in solid shoot'em'up tactics because when you get right down to it, Vigor's are just something to call this game a 'Shock' game and not a 'Call of Dutes' game. You can only carry two guns at once, and there is easily 10+ ♥♥♥♥ tier guns polluting the gun pool with their ammo. Which means in certain engagements, your main upgraded guns will likely run out of ammo and you'll be forced to use terrible re-skins in their place. Shooting guns is sticky, slow, tedious and all around not fun.  Story takes a dive 1/4th into the game and from there on its a run and gun shoot'em up, all the way to the end with its exceptionally ill thought out ending (which doesn't resolve anything), but makes scrubs who don't want to feel stupid for not getting the ending shower it in praise for 'depth', when in actuality it's simple, dull &amp; poorly thought out. Ken Levine Scrapped the real Bioshock Infinite when he ran out of time wasting it on MP no one wanted, and was forced to put this ♥♥♥♥ out on the market. Literally, nothing promised in the original hype was delivered. Everything was recycled from the REAL Bioshock Infinite to create a presentable new game, and it certainly shows. Especially in character dialogue.  Setting is un-imaginative and in comparison with Rapture, Columbia doesn't hold any water (no pun intended). In Rapture, the city felt like a living enemy. The ocean and crumbling city always loomed with you, and you were always aware that you were in a tin-can with a sheet of flexi-glass between you and death. In Columbia, you can just jump off the side and insta respawn with no consequences Super Meat Boy style. Enemies lack explanation or purpose in the world of Columbia, (take the fireman &amp; patriot) &amp; those that do are incredibly un-original or just half-♥♥♥♥♥ (crow racist people, Handy-Man).

After playing Bioshock 1 &amp; 2 previous to this game I was a bit taken aback as the usual underwater confined space environment had changed greatly to a more open air less intimidating environment, as I am still at the starting stages I can't go into to much more detail.   The initial loading(using a elevator form) to start the story backbone hasn't changed much and still gets the needed info down.  So far so good. I'll be back later with more details till then 8/10 worth it's weight.  Edit: Alright Review v2.  I've now made some interesting progress but have to admit to a bit of a sin now xD this game has made me stay up till 5am in the middle of the working week! with this achievement done story is rated at, at least 8-9/10.  Game play: Usual RPG FPS good at most parts, something that does spice it up a bit is the 'tear', where you ask Elizabeth to pull an object/open a hole in the TimeSpace etc. Now I'm going to spare the theories behind all that but the concept and usage seem to have been implemented well :).  Rating 8/10.  EDIT: Review v.3 final endgame.  Right so before we get started I got something to admit. I came into this game thinking the with a bit of a snooze of this type of combat so normal difficulty caused me to miss the defence a bit in the final battle. That said.  Le Usuals:  Game play good very interactive, bit buggy on getting that bird to target sometimes with keyboard and mouse, attempted with controller similar issues.  GFX: Bit bright at times but I guess that is the effect, setup on first run well worth it.  Story:........ Right so for le kiddies I gotta kinda star some of this out but lets give a moment just to say thank you Irrational Games! Right now... excuse my less intellegent version... It was a rightous skullf**k. I won't go into detail as that would absolutely destroy the point of experiencing it but wow thinking it over a few times really gives me the chills :) at the same time completely destructive effect. My brain hurts for over thinking the details but deffinately a story worth telling over and over. Wow.  Again thanks to Irrational Games for the solid mindf*** you just gave me.  Final Rating 9/10 Worth its weight in MUR! HAHAHAHA *pop*",

At several points in the game I found myself in awe and utter appreciation for the attention to detail by the developers. Bioshock Infinite is a game that is beautiful inside and out. I never had any trouble with mechanics, bugs, NPC's or anything. I did have a few FPS drops, which took focus off the in-game immersion. It had no real effect on how I played, but was noticable to the average gamer. ****SPOILER**** (I warned you) I also LOVED how they played around with the idea of multiple coaligned worlds. I would have liked to explore other worlds and see each of their differences, big or small.   All in all, I would rate Bioshock Infinite a 9/10, with its beautiful music in and out of combat, correct use of scenery to set the tone of the game, and one of the best stories I have been the hero of. I highly recommend this game to everyone, not just gamers.",

            "review_text": "Most of us have all played the stellar Bioshock 1 and 2, and we've all made the obvious comparisons in our head when we think of Bioshock Infinite: the weapon limit, linear level structure, and a new mind-bending story. Among the top complaints are these three nuances that play an exceptional and pivotal role in Infinite; to some, the streets of Columbia are too linear when compared to the openness of Rapture, to others, the new weapon system doesn't adequately compliment the new baddies, and to a stubborn select few, the story simply either makes no sense or isn't quite as memorable as the first installment. To each his own, I suppose, but when we consider these 'faults' to hold the experience back, we make room for further diminishing of the series as a whole. We have to feel some empathy for the developers at Irrational and understand what kind of thought was put not only into Rapture's cavernous tunnels, but Columbia's banner-ridden streets.  Unfortunately, I won't go into any detail about that stuff, because I don't (or didn't) work at Irrational, I wasn't there for the writing process, and I've never seen how these concepts fly into Ken Levine's head. What I CAN do, lacking this information, is NOT compare Rapture and Colombia at all. Bioshock Infinite is in a completely new setting, with completely new characters, and while it may follow some similar ideas and share a basic plotline, what we know about either game is so NOT subjective, so NOT interchangeable that it makes no sense to start comparing at all. They share the same title, so what? Vigors or Plasmids? Who cares? What difference does it make if Bioshock wants to take us into the sky for an adventure we can't quite explore so well as an underwater palace? There's a lot less room for walking up in the sky, mind you.  If you found fault in the game not because you found inconsistencies regarding this and the 2007 giant, but because you simply couldn't get a grip on the controls, the mechanics, or the story, by all means, you have your victory, and there's no sense in fighting over a cause you've already won. However, I have one message to those who insist to deem such tremendous games to be similar only because they share rather malleable concepts: BREAK THOSE CHAINS. ARE YOU A MAN, OR ARE YOU A SLAVE? I'm not trying to insult, I'm not trying to incite argument, I'm only trying to remove the slight tarnish that comes with a reputation, be it good or evil. When Bioshock decides to move a few miles up out of the water, you COMMIT, you don't QUESTION why it's moved or try to calculate the actual distance between the two.  Again, to each his own, but I don't like sitting back and watching a game become progressively reviled because it is by law a member of the Bioshock series and therefore must be treated as inferior to its predecessor. In time, all things will eventually pass, and I should save my ranting for the future, but for now, I hereby declare that you will find no error in any three of these games. Should you find error in any of them, please make certain that you are judging the game in its own right. While there are some franchises that DESERVE the compare/contrast treatment (Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty are the ostensible ones), Bioshock is NOT one of them.  Buy it, play it, love it. Just don't let the gritty bluish sepia of another masterpiece ruin this one.",

Still bought this to support Irational Games before it got shut down tho. :) By far, the best FPS game (Story and Singleplayer wise) I've ever played. 10/10. :) The series has also became my ALL TIME favorite. It's just that amazing.   Pros: -The story is incredibly well written. -Great voice actors (come on it's Troy Baker!) -Fun Dialogs between Elizabeth and Booker. -Great soundtrack (Especially 'Will the Circle Be Unbroken' by Elizabeth) -Astounding graphics, the art style of the series has always attracted me. Infinite also gives you to bright and lively cities that you can't see in the original Bioshocks.  -Fun gameplay (to me, it's not 'too linear' like CoDs) -LOVE the newly imagined vigors! -Elizabeth -Mind-♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot twist. It is not an ending for Bioshock if it doesn't come with a mind-♥♥♥♥ing plot twist. The plot twist in this one is pretty confusing and will take normal people some times to figure it out, but it also leave out a few question marks in your head.  -Enemies are not too easy to kill, a little bit challenging. completed 1999 mode TWICE on original story and also 1998 mode on both the Burial At Sea story DLC. -Burial At Sea shows you the lively Rapture that actually doesn't have splicers chasing you around! -Burial At Sea to bridge Infinite to Bioshock 1 and 2.  -THERE'S TOO MANY BASICALLY EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.  - -------- more will be added as I replay the game again LOL -------------  Cons: - THERE'S NO WAY TO UNPLAY THIS SO NOW I CAN'T PLAY THE GAME LIKE I 1ST PLAYED IT ANYMORE (just like The Last of Us) :(  Now, 'would you kindly' buy this game and play it again, and again, and again, and again? ;)",

        {
            "review_text": " This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock Infinite then skip to  Results  and read from there.   Irrational Games takes what 2K started did and pushes it above and beyond reality. One cannot come to words for how to describe BioShock Infinite as there are no words that possibly capture its essence.    Story:  As you sit in your little office you are given an offer, one that will allow you to be free of all that you owe. Two people, a man and a woman, provide you with an ultimatum with you accept. You are given the opportunity to go to a world in the clouds and retrieve a girl. As you push through your mission you will learn more about yourself than you ever wanted to know.    Campaign:  BioShock Infinite campaign is of decent length. Depending on the difficulty you chose and your play-style you get through this game from anywhere between 10-16 hours. I would recommend taking your time as this game is more about the story than the gameplay and missing the smallest element can result in a completely different understanding. The campaign is divvied up across 40-chapters, all varying in length, some take only a minute, while others you’ll be wondering for at-least an hour. An interesting element in Infinite is that almost all of the cinematics involve player interaction. You control basic camera elements, as well as in some scenes interaction with the environment. This provides a more immersive campaign than traditional games.    Gameplay:  BioShock Infinite does away with tonics, ADAM, and limited weapon upgrades. Instead of Plasmids you use Vigors, which are essentially the same thing with a different name. The only currency in the game is Silver Eagles, most likely based on the US Silver Dollar and Half-Dollar. You can use this money to buy weapon upgrades, Vigor upgrades, and ammo/health/salts. Unlike in the first two you no longer need to acquire Adam to get Vigor upgrades, which means you can customize your gameplay based on what you plan to use more. I was weapon intensive so I spent all my cash on weapon upgrades, and only upgraded on Vigor for the achievement. You also don’t buy Vigors instead you unlock them for free throughout the campaign which means you will have every single one by the end of the game.   There are 14-weapons that you will find throughout the campaign: Sky-Hook, Broadsider Pistol, China Boom Shotgun, Triple R Machine Gun, Huntsman Carbine, Bird’s Eye Sniper Rifle, Paddywhacker Hand Cannon, Peppermill Crank Gun, Pig Flak Volley Gun, Heater, Burstgun, Repeater, and Hail Fire. So you won’t feel limited in this game by your weapon choice, as you have more than you can ever imagine. Although despite all these choices you can only ever carry two-weapons at one time. So you will more than likely stick to what you like, as you may not get it back for a while if you let it go.   A new feature to the series is Infusions; infusions are vials found throughout the campaign that allow you to increase your health, shield, or salts (mana). Depending on your play-style you may find more or less of these throughout the campaign, but you will probably not find them all. Some are in secret areas, while others are right infront of your very eyes. Infusions allow you to customize yourself without limiting your capital.   Results:  BioShock Infinite is an amazingly beautiful game that is aweing and terrifying at the same time. Like all BioShocks you will enter confused and cautious, but as the game unfolds you will never want to put it down. The story is beautiful, the gameplay is fantastic, the music is breathtaking, and the environment is inspirational. As you play you will learn more about yourself that you can imagine through even the simplest choices, heads or tails?  Pros: +Amazing story, amazing doesn’t even breach how brilliant it is. +Beautiful environment, you will stand there just to look at how beautiful the architecture is, how elegant the people are, how clean the world is. +Amazing music, the music is simple but rather still brings much depth to the game. Even the combat music draws shivers up your spine. +Great graphics engine, as well as a fantastic optimization tool.  +Awesome boss battles, which keep you on your toes  Cons: -The enemies are kind of lacking (Most of them are the same enemy with a different gun) -The combat AI is rather limited, I found myself taking advantage of how stupid they were on many occasions. -They got rid of the manual saves (if you have a busy schedule you sometimes don’t have time to find a checkpoint).",

            "review_text": "Not everyone was entirely happy or impressed with where the developers chose to take this third entry in the almost-legendary Bioshock series, but in my opinion the decisions made were mostly the 'right' ones. MOSTLY.     Let me just say straight up - and this may well be an opinion subject to change given that I've played the first two games twice and this one but once - that this is probably my 'least favourite' of the three games. This is a purely personal thing: I am, on the whole, more a fan of 'horror' than other fantasy-related genres, and while the first two games were perhaps not strictly of said genre, they certainly leaned more heavily toward that side of things than this latest instalment does.    Which brings us to the first two significant decisions made during the development of this game: first up, the change of setting from ruined, claustrophobic underwater city to a city in the clouds rapidly HEADED towards downfall; and secondly, the shifting of the main 'enemy' type from insane, physically-deformed mutants (some with the rough equivalent of supernatural powers) to well-armed soldiers and revolutionaries caught in a power-struggle to either defend or bring down the mad 'prophet' who founded their would-be utopia.    It's obviously a matter of purely personal taste which of these two 'tones' one prefers...but in spite of myself generally favouring the former, I do have to say that they really COULD NOT have gotten away with a third game set in the city of Rapture. So all things considered, I'm conceding that they probably made the 'right' decision. It was due time to change things up a little, and they've done so in a way which is equal parts 'obvious' (moving from a city under the sea to a city in the clouds) and 'inspired' (they really could have just done another POST-apocalyptic scenario, but instead chose to tell an entirely different story...and good for them)!    This said, the actual GAMEPLAY is remarkably similar to the earlier games, with one important exception: they've replaced a bunch of lovable (if slightly creepy) little girls with a single grown woman, and this is arguably where things become most different. Say goodbye to the oddly endearing task of liberating and/or baby-sitting 'Little Sisters', and say hello to a sassy, would-be 'romantic' interest who's constantly torn between despising our (anti-) hero for his 'brute'-like behaviour, and being strangely attracted to him for, well, basically the same reasons (hmmph...women)!    Not only does this change the tone of the piece quite significantly - call me a sap and/or misogynist, but I was actually quite moved by all the 'take care of the cute little gals' antics of parts 1 and 2 - but in effect also makes this a much more linear experience than the first two games. Our only reason to 'backtrack' now is to get more goodies hidden behind doors which our female companion can helpfully pick the locks of, rather than the far more involved task of harvesting 'ADAM' required in the first two games.    In short, we've lost a bit of tiny bit of strategizing along the way, in favour of a more straight-forwardly arcade-y experience of moving from location to location and killing lots of things and picking up a bunch of stuff. Again...personal preference will decide for the individual whether this is a good or bad thing. I myself found it all a bit repetitive and 'draggy' towards the end, and found myself mainly using only two of the eight 'vigors'/special powers on offer, but y'know...that's just me.     Whichever way you look at it, this is still a pretty smart, classy game. It boasts some of the best graphics in video game history (think an ultraviolent 'Disney' cartoon, and you're getting warm), and a pretty interesting storyline to boot (though I gotta say, the people who made such a huge fuss over the supposedly 'controversial' ending...you people really need to read more, or at the very least stop watching all those ♥♥♥♥ing Michael Bay and Marvel movies, 'cause it really wasn't THAT much of a mind-blowing revelation at the end).    There's every chance I'll even find myself utterly adoring it the second time around, but right now...frankly, I'm a little 'spectacular'-ed out. Which is a way of saying this game isn't exactly anyone's definition of 'subtle', so if that's what you're looking for...I dunno, maybe try Gone Home or something instead. But if it's slam-bang action and jaw-dropping scenery you want, with just a pinch of cleverness and mind-♥♥♥♥ing thrown into the narration to add a bit of spice, there's not much risk of finding disappointment here.    Verdict: 9/10.",

A lot of the other negative reviews even highlight its story as a strong point, but it's just as weak as everything else. It's needlessly convoluted and plays to contemporary, pseudo-intelluctual discussion about quantum mysticism (which it, sadly, labels as quantum physics/mechanics; pretty damn insulting and ignorant). Plus, BioShock Infinite's story is VERY short. Not saying I want tedious bits just to kill time, but somehow this short game still had those parts anyway. What was the deal with this game allegedly having 'Hollywood-level' writing? Is that supposed to be a positive thing?  The gameplay is nearly identical to BioShock 2, save for it's more dumbed down and includes two extra forced mechanics that are rarely helpful/needed (rifts and skyhook if you need to know). It isn't like I expect a completely different formula for a sequel, but I also don't expect practically the same. The corridor shooter is getting stale. What's even sadder is Doom has more enemy variety than this game.  The graphics and soundtrack are cool, but if I wanted to look at pretty pictures and listen to good music I would just do that. This is a non-point.  I seriously felt like I was robbed for buying this game when it came out. There is no replayability save for an extra difficulty unlocked after beating the game once and the overpriced DLC (which, believe me, is overpriced for what it is). Rent this game for console or just wait for when Steam allows friends to lend it to you. It is a big waste of money to buy.

            "review_text": "Visually intriguing, but otherwise a generic shooter, with cliched writing.   The game has a few good concepts, but it never truly utilizes either of them, or in some cases, they just fall too short of being interesting. The world is set up to be big and explorable, but then changes direction, and ends up being a literal horde fest, with little to no user interaction. You can collect things, and that's about it. Most of the weapons are horrible, and you'll find yourself constanly looking for ammo. Even though you're able to buy them from dispensers, It's just never enough, and you end up running back and forth in search for it.  Because of this, and the linear 'hit-n-run' objectives, the gameplay quickly becomes boring and repetitive. The game tells you at the start, that it's not always the best option to fight, however, you can't do much else, seeing how sneaking is either practically impossible, or it goes overboard and your enemies won't notice you, even after you repetadly stab them in the back.  The 'Story Rich' tag is ridiculous, as the whole plot can be summed up within 2 sentences. Character development is forced, and badly timed, with idiotic symbolism, that just feels out of place. An example would be making a character randomly cut her hair, for the sake of showing a personal 'change', which is laughable and weak. A woman won't suddenly become more masculine and reliable from a change in hair style, nor will that show any determination. It's also painfully obvious, that the inclusion of such and similar tropes were for fetishistic reasons, and lazy writing. The creators tried to justify all this with a wannabe 'artistic' ending, with make-belief deepness, which ends up being half-♥♥♥♥♥ and totally out of place.  All in all, it's clear that this was made for a more casual, and child like audience, who's only reference for comparison is COD.  ##############################UPDATE#############################  So I came back to this game after half a year, and replayed it, thinking that I might have been too harsh on it. What I came to find, wasn't that big of a difference.  The thin plot not only makes me cringe, but manages to have more holes in it than an empty shopping cart. There's numerous things that don't even make sense, I bet the lead writer just thought, that using transdimensional time traveling will just 'fix itself', and 'oh well but it's just a different dimension' will be a good enough excuse for bad writing. Albeit I have to admit that one or two supporting characters are indeed interesting.   The guns aren't as horrible as I remembered, but they're definetaly bad. It doesn't help that the game misleads you either, it constantly reminds you that short bursts are more accurate, and effective against enemies, which is not true at all. If you've ever played any FPS games, you would think like that statement, and would certainly approve it, but in this game, that's not happening. Simply because there's literary no recoil on anything, and it doesn't matter how you use your weapons, the accuracy will be the exact same thing. Using small amounts of bursts against multiple 'tanks' is practically suicide in most cases, it's a lot more effective to just camp and hold down your fire button, and spam your enemy with bullets. So yeah, go and trust the game, and you'll be constantly seeing the revive animation.  Vigors help you a lot, but again, the game eats your ammo as fast as a Mortal Kombat arcade machine. There are instances where it's impossible to even stock up on any ammo for any weapon, and you'll be facing a horde of enemies without any. Relying solely on your generic 'melee'' attack, makes surviving a pain in the ♥♥♥, I tell ya.   It also doesn't help that you sometimes can get stuck in an object lying on the ground, or hear enemies, but can't see them, until you use bucking bronco, pushing them afloat in the air, because they decided to bug into the ground. In some cases, the amount of projectile, and effects makes it literary impossible to see anything, rendering you practically blind, until you somehow manage to get onto a skyline, or in a safe cover. Civillians also just randomly disappear most of the time, but I guess that's just me nitpicking too much.   Oh yes, shout out to the people claiming that BI is ballsy for having 3 instances (literary that many sentences) of reference to racism: It's not.  I wouldn't say it's a bad game, it's decent, and somewhat replayable, with an interesting world concept, but there's a lot of room for improvement, especially with the combat system, so my review stays negative. It could have been easily better with a coherent writer, and some gameplay elements could still be post-fixed with a patch, but I don't see that ever happening.",

This game feels very, very much like the original Bioshock, but at the same time, it feels like a different game. The team that made Infinite completely redesigned the game; goodbye plasmids, we now have Vigors. No more 'hacking', but there's possession, which does something similar. No more carrying an armory of weapons (Which kind of saddens me; you can now only carry 2 guns now), but you have an amazing partner (Elizabeth) that tosses you ammo, health, and salts (Which replaces EVE and powers vigors) when you need it. The story is very indepth, even more so than the original. I would highly recommend taking you're time while playing this game; If you just rush through it like a regular shooters game, you are TOTALLY missing the point of Bioshock. The audio logs and story just makes this game feels so complete. Not just that, the combat mechanism is fun as well and balanced.

            "review_text": "The third in the Bioshock series, Bioshock Infinite is the latest from the mind of Ken Levine. This game had a lot of hype going on about it at release and, I must say, it's all true. This game is an amazing work and can truly put to rest the 'video games as art' debate. Infinite is easily on the top 5 games I have ever played list, and this is factoring in the age I was at when I played it. What I'm saying is playing this game was a better experience than playing Super Smash Brothers or Goldeneye was when I was 8 years old and they were top of the line games - Infinite is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure of going through in my lifetime. It is a modern marvel of genius and inspiration and the world building utilized to construct Columbia somehow outdoes the already incredible world of Rapture.   Bioshock Infinite is an adventure that grips you from start to finish and doesn't let you go even after you've completed the game. It is easily my Game of the Year and I honestly believe that it will be looked at for years to come as a shining example of the true power gaming as a medium has to convey narrative, emotion, action, and immersion to the viewer. The characters are memorable, and you develop real attachments to them, compassion, anger, fear...I thought April Ryan from The Longest Journey was the most well-defined female protagonist in video games. I was wrong. Elizabeth is a character that will stick with you in your head, and her dynamism is only outdone by the change in emotions she can provoke within the player.  While my review is glowing, the game is not perfect. There are several things that could have been improved on; however, these details are so minor when compared to the overarching entity that is Bioshock Infinite it would detract from the experience to even shed light on these mere inconveniences. How can one detract from greatness because, for example, cloth doesn't move when you run into it? None of that matters when a game like this can sink its claws into you from the moment you begin and pull you so deeply into itself that you never want the adventure to end.  Pros: Narrative Story World Building Immersion Characters Character Development Gameplay/Mechanics Polish  Cons: Only saves at checkpoints, I wish there was a quicksave feature  You know how people still look back at Half Life 2 as an example of gaming excellence? Bioshock Infinite not only meets that standard, but I feel exceeds it. This game deserves its high praise, and can easily sit in the company of such classics as the Half Life series. Bioshock Infinite is the new benchmark, and is a game that must be played by anyone and everyone.  A+",

The story telling itself was in my opinion pretty great. As the player I was able to empathize with the protagonist quite easily. The scenery was really impressive and the graphics were phenomenal. The game itself takes a spinoff of some original American history and asks what could be if there really was a floating city. The soundtrack was really well done. However, there were a few downsides to the game also. The gameplay was quite linear, the codes that Elizabeth can break almost feel like you are going out of your way and unlocking the chests feels quite counterproductive also. Unlike the previous games in the series, the choices you make don’t effect the end of the game. Instead if you choose to steal from a neutral area the only con is the NPC’s will become hostile and attack you. The ending was a bit confusing, however after searching up online it made more sense as to what was happening. Overall I would rate the game a 9/10. I would totally recommend this to all of my friends to try this out.",

BORING. What happened to plasmids and how they were a major plot point on the first two games? replaced with plasmids that aren't explained at all and fill the, again, generic role of powerups.  - characters: booker is just another pasty emo kid who wants attention because he's distraught for losing his daughter to comstock. Elizabeth isn't much better, especially since her role is lockpicking and throwing booker guns. Also yelling booker alot, which gets annoying as hell. oh and she's booker's daughter, which was totally not obvious by the beginning of the game *wink wink nudge nudge*  Overall, a generic, blatant call of duty ripoff with pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character development and an overly complex story that not only makes no sense scientifically, fails as a story.",

As the core game goes I ventured upon the following differences cautiously!  1. The platform or playing area/space is a LESS crowded scenario than before! In Bioshock 1 &amp; 2, I constantly felt subdued by the environment; here there is air-to-breathe!  2. I felt like there were more pick-ups in Bioshock 1 &amp; 2. (somewhere the sense that the DLC I bought made the difference in pick-ups was a scary thought...what would I have done without them?).  3. Ok, the central game, most is played in the BLUE-SKIES. Compared with the DEEP-BLUE-SEAS like in Bioshock 1 &amp; 2 (no problem with that-the dlc has more DEPTH DIVING so to speak).  4.Alright. The mad-magazine humor-me horror does continue but not to the extent it did in Bioshock 1 &amp; 2. Bioshock 1 &amp; 2 MADE FULL USE OF THE SCREAM QUALITY in that way of thinking! Where-in the previous installments this was an unreasonable rambling that could be ignored; with enough attention NOW there is an attempt here to LOGICATE the craziness here (MAKE IT SENSIBLE-more so than before)! The villains intellect here is higher than the ZOMBIE level it was before.  5.Then the issue of saving little girls from the error of their ways (NOTE : a very moral issue) IS NOT EVEN HERE! Sure you're WITH Elizabeth and she's your partner, but it's NOT THE MAJOR ISSUE IT WAS TO BE SAVING HER! She is your partner (think co-op)! The mislead little girls aren't sprawling like they were!   6.The idea of tears is an interesting one where I have seen it repeated in the game CONTRAST (CONTRAST feels like a genuine spin-off of THIS GAME, saying that in a good light, reminiscent).   The following you may want to note!  A)-As a package I am pleased in purchasing Infinite! The DLC offers another 2 full on single player campaigns! Ace!  B)-The cassettes with comment are interspersed throughout the game in the tradition of Bioshock.  C)-If you're wanting a 'Bioshock' game then this IS YOUR THING, get it! It does stray a little from the formula of the 1st two games but it's Bioshock all the way!  Game on.",

Amongst the many improvements between the games, one of the more admirable features - which i am so glad the dev team decided to implement - was a vocal main protagonist. Booker is responsive to the situations/discussions he finds himself thrown into, which helps attain that sense of immersion developers strive to create. It does the job far better than any Gordon Freeman character ever could. Can't really talk about Booker without mentioning Elizabeth too :- the best AI companion i have ever seen in a game. The lengths the designers went to to make her feel as if she were a real companion, it's simply amazing. Cant really go into detail about the characters and storyline otherwise i'd be spoiling the game, but both are great and are fluid such that you just want to see what waits around the next corner...    Most likely a bloody turret.     My only general complaint about Bioshock infinite is that the worst thing about it is also one of its biggest strengths - it's completely different whilst being more or less exactly the same. Rapture? plasmids. Columbia? Vigors. Big daddies? Rapture. Handymen? Columbia. Rapture? Atlas/Eleanor. Colombia? Elizabeth. Civil war? Colombia &amp; Rapture. A lot of the core elements feel as if they have just been reskinned and repackaged as something new - though ultimately they are pretty much some of the reasons i fell in love with the series. So if anything, it refreshed the franchise while retaining what i really held dear to it. Don't mistake the similarities as its only content however, as there are a fair few scenarios that you would never have expected to see in a bioshock game. Lets just put it like that.  As far as the little details are concerned, the top end graphics are beautiful, the combat is often mixed up in most situations and there are a few places you'll visit which will give you a hint of nostalgia. With the graphics though, its a killer for lower end machines even on lower settings. At least have the reccomended stats to have a reasonably enjoyable time.  To sum up, i'd definetely reccomend it to anyone thats played the previous games, even to the newcomers to bioshock (though you may not understand a few references hidden in the enviroments). Cant wait for the next installment ^_^  *EDIT - No longer waiting for next installment. Irrational Games is dead.",

I am still the good guy...   This game was quite an interesting go on parallel universes. I have to admit I did not fully understand every thing but I think I got the big picture.   One of the interesting parts for me was the ego view, in which your character still talks. you don't get much of a say in it. You may do some minor decisions, but still I don't think anything really changes, no matter what you do.  After a while the battles got a little boring for me... you either are slaughtering them all in the numbers... or you are a two shot for the bigger ones. But that may be the case, because I played on the highest difficulty. Some enemies, like the 'Handyman' are quite frustrating in the case, that even their weakspot takes more ammo than you can carry around. And if you die ones they get healed by even more.   Yet it stayed challenging and the enemies make the game really atmospheric.   I won't compare it to the other parts, because for me the charm of Bioshock 1 &amp; 2 was the dark, theme, everything was in some tight spot and there was no airway to the destination, while in Bioshpock infinite everything was way more open and you felt more free overall.  Last to be said I really missed the Big Daddies, but the one thing that tends to satisfy me more on this game is that you finally are meeting people, instead of talking to them over the radio.  Took 12 hours for the main campaign, I will play the DLCs next and refer to them in an extra review.",

This one got a lot of hype, especially for the graphics/visuals. It doe snot disappoint at all. Columbia city is a marvel to wander around in. It does feel kind of locked down in a few places, but for the most part you really feel like you are wandering around the place.  The NPCs around the city are lively, interactive, and fun to watch.  Be warned there is some borderline non-PC topic material here, if ethnic commentary or male/female stereotypes bother you, just be aware. NONE of that takes away from the game though, and it really lends itself to the authenticity of the setting. So I appreciated that.  Anyway, the game!!  As you know if you read my reviews, all I really care about is that it is fun. Is it? Hell yes it is!  Yes it is more of the same Bioshock flavor in a new shinier serving. But who cares. If it ain't broke right?  The weapons are fun, the enemies are fun (Most of them ;P), the environments are fun. The story got a little crazy at times and I had to slow down to keep up with it (I get lost in the shooting sometimes) but if you follow it close enough you'll be fine.  The Elizabeth 'power' just makes everything that much more interesting.  Overall I don't think there were many times where I was rushing through a boring area or stumbling around lost.

            "review_text": "BioShock Infinite trades the gloomy city of Rapture for the sunny city of Columbia. However, that does not mean that things in Columbia are bright and cheerful. The combat in Infinite is very similar to the previous games. Mixing plasmids (in this game, they're called vigors) with guns was fun in the first two games and it's even more fun in this one. Many of the vigors can be combined for extra damage against enemies, such as dousing an enemy in water and then shocking them.   I really liked how the environment of BioShock Infinite was much more open than that of previous BioShock games. Unlike the cramped corridors of the first two games, the environments in Infinite allow you to be a lot more mobile as you engage enemies.   The story is phenomenal. I don't want to say much of it for fear of spoiling the story, but the story is the best part of the game by far. That's not to devalue the gunplay -- it's fun and engaging. But, BioShock games have always focused on delivering a great story and Infinite certainly does not falter.   Unlike other BioShock games, you have an AI partner (don't want to say any spoilers about her name) for most of the game. Most games have really poor ally AI, what with them always running into enemies and other frustrating mechanics. But your partner in Infinite is amazing. She gives you health, she gives you salts, and she even gives you ammo. But best of all, she doesn't run into enemies and she can't die. So many games force the most crappy allied AI upon you, but Infinite does a great job of having an AI partner be fun and useful (for once).   Lastly, I'd definitely recommend picking up the Season Pass for this game. Most developers tack DLC on their games to make a quick buck, but the DLC really adds to the game and the overarching story of the BioShock universe. Clash in the Clouds is a little lackluster -- it's a fairly fun but also fairly frustrating arena style mode. But Burial at Sea Episodes 1 and 2 add so much to the story from Infinite and the BioShock series as a whole.   If you haven't already purchased it, I recommend buying BioShock Infinite with the Season Pass. It has great gameplay and an even greater story.",

There are a lot of varied settings, but the game has been streamlined to the point it misses greatness. While I appreciate shooters with wide open spaces, it is rather hard to do well from a combat mechanic perspective. You can only carry two weapons and rather little ammo. The weapons are not very interesting either. Some only serve to be replaced by other weapons. Scrounging for ammo and heath is rather stupid as you can't carry med kits and the ammo is very limited so you always have either have full ammo or no ammo. This is the opposite of what Bioshock did. The AI is either a critique of religious zealots or just bad. To make up for the bad AI enemies sometimes just have 10 times the HP of other enemies. Plasmids have been marginalized and are not used for puzzles. Instead you can ride a kind of roller coaster or open portals. Both of these aren't very interesting from a gameplay perspective. The boss fights aren't interesting but then again they never really were in the series. While I am criticizing it I will also add that you can’t save the game manually and you just get resurrected when you die. There are certainly plot twists but they are much more cutscene related. It may sound like I hate the game, but I don't. It could have been much more though. It has great atmosphere, excellent acting, and the first side kick character I don't find annoying. It also solves the original’s lack of NPCs that are trying to not kill you or not behind a glass wall. It is a much less lonely game that the original.   I am not sure how critics can give the game an A with the combat faults (I played on hard until the last level where there didn’t seem to be enough ammo so I switched to normal)  Anyway I paid about 10 dollars for the game and I got my money's worth.

Gameplay is very interesting using different weapons , different Special Abilities (Vigors) and different gear.

Now the most ironic part is that you are not the main character or hero. It's actually your AI companion Elizabeth. When I first went to PAX East 2013 and Ken Levine was saying that 'he forgets she isn't real' I thought this guy needs to get a gf and a life. They made the AI and story so good that it is like a movie. The gameplay is just great and just overall like idk...it's up there with Half-Life. Now the only thing I did not like was the ending as it was confusing so much so you will be google'ing an explanation after the credits stop. The art style of the Bioshock series has been astounding and this one is breathtaking. You go to a beach and it feels like you are really there. The whole game feels not like a game but a Bioshock film and you are the camera. Quite a lot of racism and in fact is the most racist games I have ever seen. However it's a Confederate city in the clouds so ya, there will be racism. Really Elizabeth was the star though. I often found myself talking to and responding to a computer game character which is embarrassing.",

In doing so, the game also presents its own perspective in the existential dialogue of freewill and pre-determination, on societal, personal, and in-so-far as video games are concerned, a technical level.

So the game starts off with you booker dewit being on a boat with two other people that cant be seen since they are facing away they take you to a tiny rock island that has a lighthous on it. you go inside and you se a dead man with words saying repay the debt written in blood on the wall you go up and find a chair (i do skip sometimes cuz its a long story} that take you to the floating city of columbia. after exiting the chair thingy u encounter many different things in the city that seems to have a religion that worships a man prophet. after an encounter with a group that wants you to hurt a couple that is of two different races you are known as the false prophet because of a mark on your hand. you continue your jurney to the main building statue thingy that holds a girl you have to get to repay a debt. when you find her you find out that she is named elizibeth has a cut off pinky and has the power to open tears witch are basically portals that open up to a differnt version of the world i cant really explain. you tell her that you will set her free and take her to paris, so she follows you. when you get to a ship to paris, she finds out that you actually set the cordinates to new york and trys to fly the craft by knocking you out. but she runs into trouble and you both get caught by a trades group against the government. she asks you for guns in return for his ship. so you open a tear to a world where she already has the guns. but in this world you are a marder that fought and died for the cause of taking down the government. she refuses to give you a ship thinking you are an imposter. you kill her and go to comsock house wwich houses the prophet matthew comstock. you kill him and tak his ship but in the end you end up having to destroy elizibeths tower to destroy the power cell things that keep elizibeth from having her full power. she then takes you to rapture the underwater city witch has a light hous on the sea top. they go inside and elizibeth shows him the many world with many differn outcomes they need to kill comstock wich is alive in many worlds. she takes him to a part in his life where he sold his child to pay off a debt but as he trys to take the baby becaus he changed his mind. the portal seperating him and comstock closes, cutting off the babies pinky that baby is elizibeth. he then decides to kill comstock because of this. because comstock is alive in many worlds he must kill hime as a child elizibeth takes him {booker dewit} to a baptism where she tells him that in another world booker dewit became baptised and became a new man named matthew comstock. he is matthew in another world so elizibeth kills him like he wanted then every elizibith that was alive in a different world dissepears exept the main one and the screen goes black   yah the ending is quite a plot twist but it was so mind blowing to that i really wanted to write a review im sorry if my story telling made it seem boring because it really isnt pleeeaaase go play it you wont regrert it.    NOW FOR PROS AND CONS   MAIN PRO   the story: this games story is probably the most interesting and compelling story that ive ever seen, i mean, its filled with so many emotions and action, how could you not love it       MAIN CON  the gameplay: i know that this game has a objective pointer system on the ps3 but on pc i couldnt find it in the settings, making finding where i was supposed to go was extremely hard. thy bioshock infinite map is huge making it even harder. i might be wrong and there was actually an option in the settings for an objective leader and i was just dumb. but even if there was one this game needs a map badly.      Anyway, i would recommend this game for people who have and havn't playd the original bioshock games. its a new experience compared to the old bioshock games but i think its better.",

The story is confusing at first but when concluded leaves you both satisfied and full of questions. It is a complex game, nothing we really have seen before and thus feels very original.   What shines the most is the story, voice acting and visuals of the game. The combat is nothing special but does not bring the game down in any way.   I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a beautiful game with alot of mysteries for you to find out. It never feels slow or boring, there is always something that keeps you going forward and thriving for more. This is absolutely one of the best games I have ever played.",

It is hands down my favorite campaign I have ever played when it comes to video games. I compasre it to almost watching a movie. the story line is laid out so perfectly, there is almost no boring spot in the game. (Except for the beginning when all you do is walk around for a bit). at the end, I dont know how the creators did it, but they made the crazy ending work great. The end is a major twist in the plot that you will never see coming, with an awesome easter egg to go with it. I give this game a 10 out of 10, and I recommend it to you if you don't have it yet.",

If you prefer games that focus purely on gameplay and don't focus on the story then you should not get this game. But if you like games with an complex story,beautiful architecture, great level design and insanely well-written characters then this is the game for you.  Graphics: 9/10; You will be stunned of what the unreal 3 engine is capeable of when you first enter Columbia. The world in Bioshock is filled with so much details that it warmed my heart because most developers don't care for them in games these days. Although the overall picture is sometimes dulled by some muddy textures this game still looks great.  Sound: 10/10; not much to say here. The Weapons sound great, the sountrack is phenomenal and the dubbing actors are some of the best I have ever heard in a game/movie.  Gameplay: 9/10; This is clearly Bioshocks biggest 'weakness'. The gameplay in itself can get repeteitive because there are not many different types of enemies, but because the story is so great you feel like having a reason to fight. Throughout the game I had much fun combining the different weapons and vigors and some gameplay elements like the tears or the skyhook give the game an extra kick.  Level Design: 10/10; Not only is Columbia a beatiful place to look at, but it is also a great place to explore. Allthough the levels are not as big as in Bioshock 1 there are many details hidden in every place of the city. If you take your time you will love this game even more. It just feels so original and not a single place in the game was recycled. Every level feels different.  Story: 11/10; The story of Bioshock Infinite is a gem. From the beginning till the very last minutes of the game you will ask yourself 'how will it continue? how will it end?'. The whole game long it will keep you entertained on a level that I thought wasn't even possible. The characters are amazing. In some situations I allmost forgot that it is 'just a game'. Infinite will create emotions like fear,sadness,rage and hate with such ease that it will leave you wondering why other developers can't do this. And I can promise you 1 thing if nothing else: After finishing the game you will remember every single chapter of the story. It will burn into your brain and won't let you go.",

Maybe 2 or 3 each; beginning, favourite weapon and the final battle?  Bioshock Infinite is different. When others try to impress with never ending explosions and proclaim that as highlight, Infinite sows brilliant, but sometimes confusing, ideas in your mind mixed with deep emotions and complements it with a good dose of gunfights, high speed skyrailing and more or less supernatu...biogenetic powers.  First of all, the game is a thought experiment...a thought experiment with quite good graphics and amazing sound as well as music. The developers from Irrational Games (quite fitting name, right?) will send you and Booker DeWitt (the Hero) through atmospheric and panoramic landscapes...cloudscapes, maybe? Because except for the beginning the whole story takes place in Columbia, a town in the clouds with bright sunshine and never before seen technology. Speaking of story...where the bright sun dwells, it casts long and dark shadows... To speak more detailed about the plot and its twists would ruin the experience playing it, so I will leave that aside.  Just two words:Unfolding ingenuity.  But what stands out most is the Lady in blue and white, Elizabeth. It isn't even her fantastic voice actress or her animations, which are on a enormously high standart, rather it is that A.I. of her. In battles she takes cover, shouts the position of dangerous enemys, is never in your way, supports with ammunition or with some abillitys of her, reacts to your actions...etc.. In more peaceful moments she gives additional information on the environment or on her life so far, picks locks like Houdini, searches places for useful items nobody would even consider to look for...and hands it over! Moreover she feels complete. It is the way she moves around or idly stands, the way she brings a smile on your face or most important: She talks to you in situations, you would talk to her in real life. She is a companion done right...and that is rare.  One tip along the journey I recommend you, with this review, to take: Play on hard difficulty... in nearly every situation DeWitt is superior to his foes, so in order to die you have to do it deliberately (most of the time...yeah I know there is this one...you will see).

            "review_text": "If walking through a motion picture is your thing, this game is for you. The story and progression is quite linear, but that isn't to say it is a bad story. It's quite good. The game looks gorgeous, comes with gruesome kills and a whole bunch of find-it achievements that were designed to cause your inner OCD child to have a meltdown, seeing as you can't backtravel if you missed something.   My biggest complaint is the bland combat. While visually exciting to watch the effects of certain vigors on the enemies, you're really only fighting them to progress the story and watch the violent outcome of your light gun. There is no grit to the combat. There's no rush from escaping impending doom, no real penalty for dying (even played on hardest difficulty, which I highly recommend to anyone who has ever used a mouse before), and with the exception of one obtusely difficult enemy which you only see a few (3?) times in the game, it's a walk in the park. Not including the one boss, and counting different colored grunts using a shotgun versus a machinegun as one type, there are only five (5!) enemies in the game. You're shooting things to watch them go boom so you can listen to Elizabeth discover the outside world.  If the exploration factor and the storyline wasn't as good as it is, I'd have put this down and been upset at my purchase. Really the only thing that made it difficult was trying to get all the achievements in one playthrough, a choice I decided upon as my own difficulty modifier, because the game was simply too easy.  Buy it on sale, or wait for a sale. Also so far, season pass has Burial at Sea pt 1 (took me 2 hours, and that was turning over every stone and attempting all achievements), and a wave mode where you compete for high score with CiTC. Unfortunately, a wave mode is only fun if the combat is entertaining.  Tips:  -Play on hard. -Once you leave an area, it's gone. Do your searching, side questing, and loot hording before you leave the area (you're prompted yes/no). -Upgrade the items you like. You will not obtain enough money to upgrade even half of your items and vigors. I died maybe 6 times (the only way to lose money, even then it's VERY minimal, almost trivial) through the whole game, and I'd like to think I hoovered every inch of everywhere. -You'll have enough lockpicks. Open it. It's always worth it. -If you buy the DLC, the only way to get your infusions is at the BEGINNING of the game. Don't try the game, then buy the DLC. You'll miss out on half of your early bird bonus. -If Elizabeth stops to look at a random pile of junk, you probably should too. 75% of the time, there's something there.",

Being my first time entering the Bioshock world, my opinions on the game weren't biased or influenced by how it held in comparison with the previous titles. While I'm unsure how the game stands with the last two games I can say with the utmost confidence that this game is a blast from start to finish, and you would be missing out if you choose to ignore it. The combat is open, giving the player a shield for defence, a multitude of fully customizable weapons and powers called 'Vigors' to dole out pain to those in your path. Certain enemies are annoying to fight, like the Ravens and the Handymen but for the vast majority the combat was enjoyable, even if the shield was as strong as wet paper. Throughout the game the player is accompanied with an NPC ally, Elizabeth. Unlike other NPCs Elizabeth isn't the kind of character who needs excessive hand-holding, and when she's introduced a message informs the player that she can take care of herself. She doesn't get in the way of gameplay and actually contributes greatly by locating ammo, health and Salts for the player when he runs low on any. The story is the kind that if I mention a single bit of it then the entire game is spoiled, all I'll say is that it is well written and flows magnificently, weaving in with itself throughout the game to form an intricate pattern.  However, I can't say that the game has much of a replay value. While the combat was good it was far from memorable and didn't have as much of a lasting effect on me as the story did (except for the fast-paced Skyline riding, that was a lot of fun). As well the game suffers from FPS drops and stuttering, as a side-effect of being a near direct console port.  All things considered, Bioshock Infinite is an unforgettable experience with a story that will have the player immersed and invested from start to finish.",

Unlike in Bioshock Infinite which your only restricted to two weapons and you have to look for new weapons to switch them.  4) Remade healing effect of food , much more balance and logic to it.  5) New Vigor / Eve as they called it in Burial at Sea 6) New weapon skin and weapons 7) Great storyline , so far. 8) Able to swap clothing , even ones previous you found.   Con  1) Too short for Episode 1 , not worth the 14.99$ at all.  2) Game feels unbalance  3) Very limited amount of ammo your able to carry.   I won't recommend anyone buying Burial at Sea Episode 1 for the time being , for the gameplay if not mistaken I think it's less than 3 hours depend on how you play it and for 14.99$ even an Indie game could last longer and gives you more entertainment than that.. I say two choices  1) Wait for Episode 2 to realease and hopefully it's lot longer  2) Just ignore this DLC and continue to enjoy Bioshock Infinite and save that 19.99$ (Season Pass) / 14.99$ (Burial at Sea Episode 1) for some other better games / DLC maybe coming in future ?",

(so far) Bioshock franchise is about immersive experience, customisation, Magic &amp; Guns, difficult choices, strong characters, and exploration. I did not find the last three.  You will have no choice to make. Straight up line. up to the ending. I find quite ironic to have only one ending, considering the context (those who finished it will understand that).  You will know and will discover little about the main character (for future DLC ?). Protagonist are not develop more than a couple of sentence at begining of chapter up to it's conclusion. Tapes hidden around the levels are barely few words giving little of the context / goal of the characters. Only Elizabeth saves it by being a really valuable addition.  The higher pace and level design of this episode leave almost no room for exploration. No way you get lost. You just walk the (nice) corridors up to the next (beautifull) gun fight area. I think it's ok for a COD to be like this, but for a Bioshock it's not. So many question are let unanswered. Why the hell this city is here ? how does it fly, Why comstock is doing this ? I'm not even talking about the ending that will leave you with thousand more questions.   Definitly a great game you want to play, but not the greatest Bioshock. 16/20",

Cons:  - No real innovation from previous bioshock games. Vigors are a variation on the Plasmids, and the weapons are similar throughout the game. - The variety of enemies is seriously lacking.. by half way through the game you will be engaged in the story but feeling like the combat is a quickly boring grind.

The Elizabeth character is the most lifelike npc companion I've encountered to date, and her presence makes exploring the world even more enjoyable. The setting is fantastic, and together with all the posters, lighting and npc/voxaphone dialogue, it really feels like you are in a vibrant living world. The music in the game is also fantastic, with many songs from the 1910s and 1920s era. Furthermore, they flawlessly produced many modern songs in the old fashioned styles (eg ragtime) which was a massive highlight from the game.  The game must be appreciated for its artistic genius first, and as a game second, which is possibly the source of the disappointment and negative views. The combat is passable but nothing remarkable. It serves merely as a tool to keep players exited, and to break up periods of exploration which many players in the target audience would tire of without the adrenaline rush they've come to expect in a shooter, and does not add to the plot. In fact, the most exhilarating parts of the story contain no shooting at all. The periods of peaceful exploration, such as at the start of the game, where there is no threat were my favorite parts in the game, and I really do wish there was more of this. There are so many snippets of dialogue, hidden audio tracks in the background and interactions with the game world in these short periods of the game, that I found I spent much less time fighting in battles than simply exploring every nook and cranny of this vibrant and fully fleshed out world. Truly a rare gem in today's game industry. Morrowind, Telltale's Walking Dead/Wolf Among Us and The Witcher 2 are the only other similar artistic games which come to mind, and these fall far short of the bar raised by Infinite.",

I don't usually like FPS, which is why BioShock was such a shock to me, but after the first hour or so of gameplay I became completely immersed and genuinely began to care for the characters. The only problem I have is with the two weapon capacity, unless you find the two best weapons in game you're pretty much stuck during the final confrontation. However, the use of vigors more than makes up for this.   Buy this game you won't regret it!",

As someone who tends to value narrative and story over gameplay and graphics (within reason), I enjoyed every minute of this game as you fight your way through the floating metropolis of Columbia. The art style feels perfect for the setting, and it's easy to form a deep love or hate relationship with the characters of the game. Elizabeth opened a tear in my heart. It changes things up a little from the other BioShock games in terms of gameplay, particularly with the SkyHook by adding a bit of altitude into your tactical performances. Plasmids are now Vigors, and now have trap mechanics that allow you to set up bottlenecks and other manuvers that take out loads of enemies at a time. Additionally, you can only have 2 weapons at a time, so choose wisely!  All in all the story is rock solid,   even when messing with time travel and the multiverse. One thing that I still wonder about the ending though. By taking Booker back to the the pivital choice moment in his life to prevent Comstock from being born, doesn't this in turn create a new variable in which he doesn't let Elizabeth drown him?   I can't wait to check out the DLC. This game is a must buy, and in my opinion should be ranked amongst the top 50 games ever made, if not 25.",

My only problem with this game is the utter lack of DLC released for it. The season pass has been almost worthless at this point. That and the difficulty level. I've played through the series and I have to say this one was laughable easy on hard mode. 1999 mode is an improvment but still doenst bring what it promises.

            "review_text": "I’ll admit it; I was not a fan of BioShock. Back in 2007 when the first BioShock game came out, I admittedly didn’t give it a fair chance. Even when BioShock 2 was released and all my gamer buddies were chomping at the bit for another foray into Rapture, I was more so “le meh”. I know, kind of troll-ish but that was how I approached it. I remember when I first saw screenshots and footage of BioShock Infinite and the original debut trailer, I was blown away by this new art direction the series was taking. In place of the bleak solitary horror film-esque tone of the first game, this new world was bright and vibrant with an air of vaudeville sensibilities. Before I continue with this review, I have to mention that it takes a lot for a stubborn bloke like myself to just “change” his mind from something I was so convinced of. I did not like BioShock, and I just put it away much like how I wrote off many other things I didn’t give a fair chance to. BioShock Infinite did for me what many of my friends couldn’t convince my stubborn ♥♥♥ to do, and that was give the first BioShock a fair playthough, and while a few of the things that turned me off a bit still persist, I have to say already being half way through, I am enjoying myself. BioShock Infinite was a memorable gaming experience that I will hold near to my heart, that reason alone was enough to load up BioShock again.  Welcome to the floating state of Columbia. BioShock Infinite takes place in the early 1900’s in a city floating above the United States. Columbia has seceded from the US and rather than still sharing the land, they float above it with a holier-than-thou gaze, a theme that seems ever present throughout the game’s narrative. You are Booker DeWitt, a man down on his luck with debt to his ears. He is tasked with infiltrating Columbia to rescue Elizabeth, a girl who has been kept under lock and key since she was an infant, and take her back with him to New York. With that, Booker satisfies his employers and his debt will be paid. Rescuing the girl isn’t that simple though, Booker will have to face down the leader of Columbia, Zachary Comstock, and a giant beast called Songbird. Booker and Elizabeth’s adventure quickly spirals into a story touching on themes of politics, religion, racism, classism, and of course quantum mechanics.  Despite some incredibly heavy subject matter, the game’s narrative never leaves you wondering “WTF” too often, a few moments may leave you perplexed, but this isn’t like your typical boy meets girl story. Speaking of that, I am so glad that the story didn’t all of a sudden melt into a melodramatic love ballad between the two protagonists. I love a good love story but it would feel incredibly out of place with the narrative. Comstock is an almost perfect villain for the story with Songbird being a truly terrifying monster. What makes Comstock so perfect is how his influence in an effect will turn every resident in Columbia against you; you are the enemy of the state, the false shepherd meant to lead his flock astray. The grand religious undertones are more than evident through most of the game. Songbird is a massive beast, ever watching and searching for Elizabeth, its main directive is to protect her and return her to the tower if she is ever to leave. Some of the best moments of the story come when the pair is forced to deal with and confront Songbird.  One of Elizabeth’s powers is her ability to open “tears” in the space-time-continuum. These tears lead to another world (or version of the world). The tears stand as the main driving force of the game’s narrative. Are you familiar with the theory behind quantum mechanics? One simple explanation is that for every choice we make, there is the possibility of another choice that directly contrasts. It theorized that if you go left, immediately another world is created where you make the choice to go right instead. This creates a seemingly “infinite” (see what I did there?) possibility of worlds. Elizabeth’s power allows her to access these worlds, interacting with them whether it is an item that wasn’t there before or (eventually) walking into them entirely. It takes a little bit to wrap your head around it, but this leads perfectly to subtitling the game “Infinite”.  This isn’t 2007s BioShock. When you trade a city under the sea for a city above the clouds, the scenery changes drastically. Gone are the dark corridors and glass pipes connecting one deck to the next. Instead, we have beautiful scenery and bright vibrant colors. One of the reasons I was so turned off by the original BioShock was the overall ambiance of the level design. While Rapture felt incredibly isolating, I never felt alone while traversing Columbia. From the buildings to the beaches, Irrational Games paid close attention to all the little details. Levels are designed fairly linear with some encouraging the player to deviate a bit, mostly for scavenging or side quests, been never too far off the beaten path. At times, Elizabeth will stop and mention that you can either continue the story or take a detour for some supplies. Generally this is a good chance to stock up on salts, bring your health back up, or scrounge abandoned crates for ammo and money.   I was not a BioShock fan when I first bought this game and my purchase was driven solely by the artistic choices the developers made, BioShock Infinite is a great choice for the person who wasn't a BioShock fan At some point in the game, they mention that stealing from folk or provoking the authorities will result in some unsavory consequences, but these are rarely explored. Personally I felt that was a bit of a missed opportunity, they could have implemented a simple morality system into the overarching narrative. Some points do allow a bit of choice, but never beyond a glorified heads or tails. Columbia feels huge, and if it wasn’t for the fairly linear and direct quest path, I feel like I’d be lost most of the time. Though I wouldn’t say this is a bad thing, as I stated earlier the scenery is beautiful, every extra minute I can spend admiring the world in this game was well worth it.  A final thought that comes to mind, in reflection of my time playing BioShock Infinite I feel this sense of regret. It's a bittersweet feeling mind you, this isn't regret from disappointment in the game mechanics or story, based on my review it's obvious how much I loved this game. My regret stems from that fact that never again will I feel the same way I did when I first played this game, never again will I get to experience Columbia the way I did when I first saw that vibrant skyline. I do intend to replay this game sometime down the road mind you, but it won't be the same as my first... There's something inherently beautiful about that.",

However I'd still say that the original BioShock was alot more entertaining.  I was slightly disappointed that BioShock Infinite didn't live up to expectation set by developers in early production. Even elements shown in the Beta game-play seemed to be non-existent: such as being fired at with artillery weapons and having a telekinesis power to stop the shells, sandbox level design, larger and more open areas and the random collapse of buildings as well as random weather events. However due to time, story and technology restraints many of these features were unrealistic so many of this is excusable - yet still leaves me mildly disspointed.  Also I found the ending to be a bit weak, but enjoyable none-the-less. The re-playability is also somewhat non-existent do to the linear level design that isn't present in the previous BioShock games that would have left you searching through every corner of the map in the hope that you may have missed something. I still strongly recommend playing the game. Good job 2K.",

The freedom to choose and the freedom to use are the best things in Bioshock Infinite. In addition, one is free to upgrade guns/vigors/suit as one likes with (money/finding gear) limits, of course. Game itself has only few side quests and runs in a tunnel vision, but I was still able to spend +20 hours with this game (10h for runners) mostly because of shinies: 'sniff sniff, what's here? What's that? Shiny! Glimmering! Must search this box and that drawer.' Because of this, I didn't really focus on the plot and I often missed the start of the fights. Anywho, the game has a plot and it is somewhat interesting. Skip this game if Hollywood-ish action games are not your thing.",

            "review_text": "In retrospect, nothing truly stood out for this title as compared to other titles, except for maybe its unqie presentation style, consisting of a story told via a not-very-well-done shooter, although the decent storyline compensates for the FPS element. (Let's face it, who plays Bioshock for the shooting? GO VIGORS! :D)  Setting of Columbia is charming in its own right, bright but enigmatic, as opposed to Rapture's gloomy atmosphere in previous Bioshock titles.  Vigor mechanics is quite beautifully done to say the least, I had fun trying to figure out the various Vigor combinations, such as the 'Fire' and the 'Crow', when use simultaneously, spawns flaming crows instead.  Redundant 'shield' component gets terribly annoying after awhile, since your screen will 'break' when your shield is depleted. Without actively expanding the capacity of the shield, it breaks 3-4 times in an average firefight, and the shield break animation (that takes up half of the screen) is unbearable when playing for long hours. (Imagine getting a pop-up every minute or so when you're engaged in firefight)  Gameplay lasts around 10-12hours for an average playthrough, shooting mechanics isn't spectacular, and it lacks in replayability due to story-centric game presentation style. (It's like reading a book again, which not everybody would(and could) enjoy).  Definitely a good title for a single clean playthrough for its story, but at its price (even on sale) you can probably find many other titles that have similar storytelling impact and gameplay.",

            "review_text": "This is probably the best game in the Bioshock franchise, it takes place in an entirely new location from the first 2 games, and introduces a ton of new gameplay mechanics  The combat in this game has been heavily enhanced, making it superior to its counterparts in almost every way, including the story  The story in Bioshock Infinite turns away from Bioshock 1 &amp; 2, but manages to keep the same Bioshock feel. You start off in a lighthouse, which is becoming a gimmick for the Bioshock series  The characters are very well developed, and you get to see more of who they really are as the game progresses, you also find out more about their back stories and what lead to them being in the situation that they're in when you take control  The story in this game can be confusing at times, so I highly reccomend you watch a YouTube video explaining the story once you've completed the game, but you can pick up on the important things quite easily  The campaign itself typically lasts 7-8 hours on easy-normal mode, beating the game on one of these modes unlocks 1999 mode, which makes the game much more difficult with the added risk of having to restart the game if you run out of money (you can find out more about 1999 mode online)  This game also has a good range of DLC taking you back to rapture, I've read great reviews about the DLC but unfortunately I haven't been able to play them for myself so I can't give a detailed review  I would highly recommend that anyone try this game, even if you aren't a fan of the series and haven't played any of the Bioshock games in the past, it's an amazing game with an incredible story  I personally rate it 10/10, one of my favorite games",

There were interesting weapons which I quickly chose favorites from, however throughout the game I would run out of ammo and was forced to try a new weapon, which was extremely fun and interesting. Combat system was great, your vigors (powers of some sort) and weapons blend extremely well to make a great combo during combat.  The story was amazing and extremely fun to play through, and decently lengthy (approx. 14 hours for me to play through on hard) However, some scenes got a little frustrating for me as I kept dying and was getting rather repetitive, however it could have just been that I was playing on hard but overall the story and new twists kept the game interesting throughout.   Graphics are great, and animations/voice acting was also great. The game is a little gory, as you can blow peoples heads off, and grind into them with a hand saw type weapon, among other things.  Overall, I give a 9.5/10, looking forward to playing the DLC!",

The drawback is that it's a bit more incoherent than  Bioshock , and the setting isn't quite so sharp, but it's still an amusement park worth visiting. If anything it can be accused of, it's overambition, not quite focusing as sharply as earlier  Shock  games.  Even with the traditional FPS mechanics, though, it's still one of the more innovative and original titles this year, and is definitely worth making time for. The DLC  Burial at Sea  is definitely worth playing through - though it's quite short, it at least benefits from a strong budget, not recycling as much as it could have from either  Bioshock  or  Bioshock Infinite .  One of the games that'll define this year, though it lives somewhat in the shadow of its forebears.",

            "review_text": "Bioshock Infinite follows its roots in the franchise of making both a compelling story and a new world to explore. As per Bioshock tradition this game comes with an amazing twist that leaves you senseless for a couple minutes after the credits start. The story is well written and they give enough teases to continue playing longer and longer than one had intended. You play as Booker DeWitt, a man sent on a quest to find a girl. At first a bland character, you soon see him become a very caring friend to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is a strong independent and very clever supporting character who you may fall in love with. The Lutece twins who always serve to make a break in the action and make the players think. Lastly, Father Comstock, a tyrannical dictator who seemed to have rewritten history to serve his prophet inspiring goals. Each of these characters are memorable, but the best one in my opinion is Elizabeth because of her growth.  When it comes to the gameplay it follows the Bioshock 2 formula of dual wielding weapons and 'tonics' which does cause a very fluid combat. The biggest weakness is that they only let you carry two weapons, so low ammunition is a larger reality then before. In hindsight this would be a good feature to help in thinking proactively, but some enemies are really bullet spongy which makes the fight a bit too frustrating. In order to level your weapons and tonics, you use money which makes having to pick an choose a problem because you may not always have bullets for those specific ones. No hacking so all turrets are enemies, but it is balanced out with Elizabeth's power to spawn some turrets in certain location, but was still dissappointing. Even though this is a very long escort mission, Elizabeth is anything but useless. Adding the mechanic that Elizabeth will find anything useful and give it over to Booker and at any given time. It is useful with the ammo system and health can be a moment of miracle when your close to dying and she svaes you. Overall the game isn't anything hard and gameplay wise doesn't break any new ground escept for having a competant npc being escorted, but the main point is the storyline and the gameplay does hold water, just a bit frustrating at times.  On a mechanical level this game will be hard to play if your graphics card is 4-5 years old( I actually had this issue). Otherwise this game funs well, but maybe not constant(mine went 90-110 fps on all ultra). The game itself doesn't look too amazing, but it is definitely is a beautiful world to look at just not too close. Never had a fall in framerate or a crash. Has multiple sliders for sound and an abundant amount of graphical options. Keybinding is quite excellent, but the 'tab' button seems to also pause the game(especially hard for me since I play a lot of CSGO where tab is the scoreboard).  Overall this game is great and the storyline really grips you hard with all its twists and turns. A little boring combat, but it doesn't stop one from pursuing the end. And Columbia looks so real and so full of life that you wish it was real, except for all the racism. If you are a fan favorite of the Bioshock 1, 2 and Minerva's Den: this game was made for you.",

While FPS gunplay is not my biggest cuppa tea, it is made interesting through diverse and useful powers. A further comparison to Arkham City: Colombia is a real place. While you are playing, you are in a different world, one you might like to visit despite is numerous troubles, simply because it is that real and fantastical. The characters there (note I say 'there' not 'in the game' since Columbia is real to me) bring the city to life, Elizabeth especially so. Everything she does is so natural it's easy to forget she's a piece of AI.  I'll end my rambling praise and leave you to play it yourselves.

After completing i had to grab the burial at sea dlc just for the nostalgia of Bioshock 1 and 2 and hell, it was so worth the money. The DLC is set in 1958, two years before the events of Bioshock 1 and the story ends up taking you up to the events of Bioshock 1 so you can learn how all the chaos started in Rapture.  9/10 Awesome game, would recommend to anyone who loves the other Bioshock games and people who love Fps shooters :)",

PROS- the world looks nice in 1080p ultra and the game is probably one of the most stable games i've played on ultra. oddly the only time the frames ever stuttered was away from combat walking in a darkish alley. so it really had no effect on the game. combat was always locked on 60fps.and everyone raves about the world bioshock created and it sure it's nice.  CONS- I know people will destory me for this and give me fanboy thumbs down, but the game just isn't that great.the story takes a minute to pick up, and then when it does the game trys to pad it as much as possible. there's soooo much padding in this game. There's really only maybe 4 or 5 'missions' or 'chapters' in the game. all of which shouldn't have taken very long but they make you backtrack CONSTANTLY!! if you dissagree with me, play the tear part of the game. you fight your way to a gate, oh no you cant get in, go dig up mom, defeat ghost mom, go back to the start of the chapter to find the first tear, defeat mom, find second tear, defeat mom, third tear, back to the gate, defeat mom finally, open gate.that part of the game should've taken 15 minutes, it was like 2 hours!!!! and that was like right in the peak of the story!!!!! speaking of 2 hours, i was convinced the game was over at around the 6 or 7 hour mark. but it just kept making you do one more thing one more thing. it really dragged its feet on the way out. not that the ending was bad persay, but betime i got there i was so jaded by the backtracking.  the biggest con is the legacy issue. the first bioshock came out at a different time in gaming.games were simply made differently. and i could feel bioshock infinite struggle between being linear and non-linear.it's either a non-linear game with a very tight scope, or a linear game with ADD. i just felt like the identity of the game was never something you could put your finger on and it kind of muddyied the waters as i was playing the game.  all in all i give the game a 6.5/10 i would reccomend playing it for the right price and for the $7-8 i payed, the price was totally right. there is some good content in the game, and the world is enjoyable until you're sick of doing circles in it. i just wish the backtracking didn't have me banging my head against a wall. one of the very few games i've ever played that would have gotten a much higher rating if it were 5 hours long.",

I didn't really like the design, sort of reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode that looked vibrant but had a pale story by comparison. I saw the trailer for infinite that caught my interest. My first thought was 'Oh a floating city, cool.' So I waited untill a few days ago to get it finally. Didn't know a thing about the story, all I knew was that Troy Baker voiced Booker. That motivated me to get it even more.  So, let's start with the most important part of any game... the gameplay... yeah. I heard that the gameplay was really boring and repeatative, I was a little worried at first but warmed up to the salts and vigors system. So I really enjoyed the combat. the opponents always kept me on my toes, and the first Handyman encounter made me scream. Even with all the vibrant colors and designs, the game still has this creepy atmosphere that you can really appreciate. The only thing that I think should've been included are puzzles based on the elemental vigors. But one missed oppurtunity doesn't make a horrible game. Next we have the second most important part: (for me the most important part but eh) the story. I won't even go into any detail because I would be giving away too many great fleshed out characters, twists and turns and of course AI's. This game sort of reminds me of the visual style of the old Wild Wild West games. Booker Dewitt being a drunken James West. It has a steampunk feel to it all and it doesn't feel dated or pretentious at all. So perfect story, and to quickly summarize; the graphics look great, that's the end of it.  This is not my favorite game of all time, but I truly think it is a perfect experience and a wonderful story of choice, race, religion and of course the multiverse theory. All in all 9.9/10",

Like the first Bioshock title, Infinite features an incredibly well written story, which is not something you can say about many FPS games. The main characters are simultaneously heroic and flawed; they are complex people in a way that feels more real than characters typically seen in gaming. The visuals are stunning, creating a world both fantastic yet fully realized and believable. I simple LOVE the soundtrack, made up of brilliant instrumental pieces, punctuated throughout by vintage-style takes on moden classics. As for the much talked about, somewhat infamous, ending? I feel it's perfect for the story being told, and is satisfying in a way that a typical 'and they all lived happily ever after' ending would not have.   Bottom line: If you haven't played Bioshock Infinite yet, you really should. I got it on sale, but would have happily paid full price for it. 5 out of 5.",

            "review_text": "Wow. Just wow. I played and enjoyed the first two Bioshock games, but always felt they recieved a bit more credit than they deserved. Bioshock Infinite makes the previous games feel like prototypes; this is a true marvel in game design and storytelling.  The combat may not be groundbreaking (you now have a regenerating shield ala Halo), but it's brutal, every weapon and tonic in the game is varied and useful, and for the first time in the series it's just plain fun. That doesn't mean it's now a mindless shooter; the multi-layered, biting, emotional narrative makes just about every other video game plot look like amateur hour. The highlight is Elizabeth, one of the best written and useful companions to ever grace a game; she'll toss you ammo and health in the middle of a fight, open tears to another dimension to turn the odds in your favor, pick locks for you, never needs babysitting, and quips, 'Oh my god!' when you grind your skyhook into some poor sap's face. She's awesome.  I won't get into plot specifics, partially to avoid spoilers (the less you know going in the better), and partially because I couldn't even begin to do it justice without breaking the game down scene by scene and analizing every visual cue and line of dialogue, and I'd probably need a degree in quantum physics. It can be enjoyed and absorbed on a multitude of levels, from a simple father/daughter parable to the dark history of The United States to the folly of Patriotism and Absolutism, and a whole lot beyond and between. I really cannot reccommend this enough; it's so finely crafted and carries so much weight I'd tell anyone who doesn't even like games in general to buckle in and experience something special. It's just so good.  *Quick note about the DLC: long story short it's not that good. I played the arena stuff when it first came out and was nothing special. Burial at Sea is a two part story that ties Columbia and Rapture together, but really it just dilutes and over-complicates what really didn't need explaination. The first part returns to the well of Rapture and it's pretty standard, but ends right when it gets going. The second part has you playing as Elizabeth, which going by the main story should be amazing... but it's not. It's poorly done stealth with no other options, and quite frankly it's boring. Unless you get it in a bundle for dirt cheap, just don't bother. Even then it might not even be worth the time and the bad taste it leaves in your mouth after the mindblowing main game.",

            "review_text": "This game is one of the most overrated I ever played. The environments look pretty, but why didn't they make more diverse character models for NPCs?   The 'vigors' feel tacked-on and ho-hum and were shoehorned into the unbelievable plot. There's not really any strategy besides gun 'em down when they come at you. The gunplay, and the guns themselves, are largely as generic as they get.   You can tell they had to cut some stuff--the Songbird feels utterly unnecessary to the final game design.   The story is overrated. It's gee-whiz storytelling that you get from Moffat in Doctor Who. That impresses a lot of people and it IS interesting on its surface BECAUSE OF SHOCK PLOT TWIST, but it's not particularly deep and it's not as clever as people will always say it is. Everyone wants those SHOCK PLOT TWISTS but that can be a sign that the rest of the story is lacking. I believe that is true for certain episodes/seasons of Doctor Who, and it is the case here, too. Breaking Bad didn't rely on this sort of story telling very heavily, and when it did, it wasn't unbelievable.  The story, in typical Bioshock faction, is delivered to you in voice recordings you have to find lying around. You have to snip them together in your head and figure out what people are doing and what their motivations are. None of the characters are particularly deep and this game doesn't really allow for deep character development or anything, but many of them seem rather one-dimensional. This is a feature of how they chose to tell the story. It doesn't damn the game, and the method of telling a story this way certainly has its own upsides, but it personally aggravates me.  This game is just so amazingly overrated. Buy it at $5, and don't buy into the hype, other than the pretty environments the central game design is embematic of the sort of cancer that is infecting modern first person shooters.   However, on a positive note, the developers didn't turn protecting Elizabeth into a giant escort quest, which would have made this game a REAL stinker had they gone through with that. Additionally, the second everything changes (anyone who plays the game knows exactly what that moment is) is pretty shocking. Unfortunately, upon reflection, it's kind of idiotic how the before and after contain no real shades of gray in how the society in this game is represented.  Also, the people saying this game is racist--they're idiots. Couldn't be further from the truth.",

Usually video game stories are crap, but Bioshock Infinite immerses you in a world filled with detail, intrigue, and suspense. The pacing is well done and there were few noticable lulls in the narrative. The superb writing and voice acting really injects life into the characters and for the first time in a while I felt attatched and invested in the outcome of those in the game. Elizabeth is one of, if not the most, compelling character of recent gaming history and should be an aspiring model for all future story-driven games. While the story may seem convoluted at first, the game's detail rewards those who are patient and take their time to understand Columbia and its inhabitants. Aside from this, observant players will find many interesting bits of social commentary about American society, whether it be exceptionalism, religious fervor, laissez-faire capitalism, communism, racial/cultural purity, etc... that add plenty of depth to an already compelling story.   The atmosphere is exceptional for when this game came out. The deviance of the art and ambiance from a strictly 'realistic' look adds a touch of the fantastical that complements the game's setting and story well. Simply put the game looks ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful.   My only complaint about this wonderful game is the combat mechanics. What makes gameplay enjoyable is rather subjective, but personally I felt that the gunplay was rather clunky, enemy movement seemed unnatural, and with the difficulty turned up fights devolved into repetitive cover shooting. While the game boasts interesting and creative mechanics such as vigors and the skyrail thingy, they weren't sufficient enough to cover for the general lack of smoothness and polish of the fundamental comabt system. The devs probably focused a lot more on art design and story telling than the combat and I can't really blame them. Overall I felt like the fights, apart from the occasional, exciting 'boss', were chores so I could progress in the awesome story. It was ok, I didn't mind too much because I was so into the story but if you value gameplay heavily than it could be potentinally tedious to play this game.   Apart from a potentially minor concern, I certainly recommned this truly unique and thrilling experience.",

Don’t get me wrong, I loved the art style of the game, the story is superb, and combat can get pretty gritty when mixing powers+guns+melee attacks. On the same note, combat in Bioshock Infinite felt kind of repetitive and unnecessary at times I found myself losing interest in the overall game.   There are times were combat is amazing and you are jumping from hook to hook or traveling on rails to get the jump on some enemies and you really feel like a character on a mission of retribution . However in between these moments there are sequences where it is basically, enter area, lots of enemies spawn, kill enemies, move on, repeat.   Though I did say the story is superb like combat it also has these moments where you don’t get any new character development or plot revelation and again kind of dragged down my interest.  All that being said, the game is relatively long and the DLC burial at sea sets up the story for the original Bioshock nicely. So is it worth the non-sale price that is currently on steam? ($29.99 or $49.99+season pass) that is a hard question for me to answer. For just Bioshock Infinite I’d say $29.99 is definitely worth it because the main game content is definitely worth the asking price. However, the season pass is still a bit pricy and the dlc Burial at Sea episode 1 and 2 are really the only thing you actually might want (the other stuff is just something to help you upgrade your character).

I found out about this game when I was looking through torrents for games to play while I was over at my grandparents' home because over there, there's no internet. I stumbled across Bioshock Infinite. Now, I would like to state that I've never really heard of this game before. I decided I might get a few hours of this game.   I found myself completely immersed into the world this game presented to me. I felt like I was the main protagonist and blocked out everything around me. Every feeling he felt, I felt. Everything he said, I muttered. Everything he did, I followed. I finished the game, and wasn't pleased with it. So, I decided to buy it.   The story was amazing. It worked perfectly with the atmosphere. The characters was a huge asset in the story, each with their own unique characteristics and how their personality complimented each other. The gameplay is alittle bit iffy at some points, but overall it's great. The enemies are also different from each other, meaning you have to strategically defeat them. Some are your normal 'I'm gonna shot you in the face' and some are 'To defeat me, you're gonna have to do vigor combos and plant crits on me'.    Graphics are just.... just MAGNIFIQUE! The amount of detail that goes to everything is just breath-taking. EVEN TRASH LOOKS NICE. The characters fit in every cutscene and basically, everywhere you go. Nothing seems out of place, not even the things that ARE out of place. Lighting is just right, not too much, not too little. I'm no artist, but this game is just a beauty to look at. It's like heaven on earth. (Yes, that's a game referrence)   This game towers absolutely EVERYTHING when it comes to voice-acting. Are they voice-acting or were they just secretly voice-taped during their daily life? Because, I've never heard so much emotion. Trust me, you will never go 'That doesn't right. He's frustrated but why is he talking like he's laughing?'. I would like to personally see each individual voice actor and give them gifts, just to congratulate them.   DLCs are abit lacking but for what it's worth, I'd recommend you getting them, every single one. Burial At Sea explains the aftermatch of the game and will give you abit of nostalgia if you've ever played Bioshock 1 and/or 2.   Overall, amazing game. It is my favourite game of all time, that is, until another one takes it place, but that'll be awhile. The only thing I would like to complain about it, is the eyes. Some cutscenes make Elizabeth's eyes so wide, like they're gonna pop-out. I definitely recommened buying this game.  (You may experience what I call 'Bio-depression' after you finish the game. Totally normal, don't fear. Just... wait it out.) _______________________________________________________________  For the TL;DR people,  Great game. Buy it.",

Story: It takes players from the beloved city of Rapture, the underwater paradise we BioShock fans know and adore... ...and puts us in another amazing city, the floating city of Columbia. You play as Booker DeWitt, a man who is lost in gambling consequences. (don't gamble kids) You have a simple objective. Bring them the girl and wipe away the debt. Sounds simple? You are very mistaken.  Visuals: BioShock infinite has a different graphics style to the first two, I'm not sure whether its due to graphics technology evolving or they just wanted to try something new. If it was to try something new, they did it right. Everything has a comic-book-like style to it, like if you took the graphics from borederlands and took away most of the thick black lines. (Which is forgivable, they are both by 2K)  Pros: -Amazing and rich storyline -Fast-paced gameplay with many features to give you the advantage on the battlefield -Great character Development -Easter Eggs eg. Hidden music, References to the previous BioShock games, etc. -A wide selection of weapons and vigors -Great and helpful AI (Thanks, Elizabeth)  Cons: -Sometimes gets repetitive -NPCs can bug out and jump around -You can only carry two weapons at a time, so it removes that classic BioShock feeling of conservation of ammo and keeping stocked -Removes some great features of the original BioShock games  Verdict: This, overall is a FREAKING AMAZING game. 9/10 for BioShock Infinite  -credit to DarkBetray for assistance",

There are difficult bits but they don't stop you from enjoying the amazing story. I have changed the mind of a couple of hardcore anti-gaming people and convinced them that video games are a form of art by showing them this.

If it's still possible, please make more of these masterpieces, and I hope Ken Levine does well in his next project.  It's mainly the sheer amount of detail the develpment team put into each and every section of the game to fit with the theme; starting with bright sunlight resembling a happy society and watching it progressively get darker as Columbia falls into chaos. Every room has a theme and usually a piece of dialogue to go with it, and it all fits together to create quite a lively experience that has yet to be replicated.  Some consider the combat to be a con but I think there's just a learning curve to it, when you do figure it out you end up being able to bounce across the battle area and safely pick off enemies in a way that does make you look badass. Work out which combos of weapon and plasmid you find easiest to work with and you'll find that the combat isn't bad at all.",

The gameplay/combat improves as you gain new abilities and weapons, however I would say that the gameplay is definitely the weakest point of BioShock Infinite. The story is where it's at. The pacing of the game and immersiveness is very strong -- plus the game is just gorgeous (and looks good even not on all high graphics settings).

The visuals of the game are some of the best that video games of 2013 have to offer, and utilizes it's unique realistic cartoon art-style in almost every way possible. The story was overall superb. The characters (particularly Elizabeth and Songbird) are interesting, and give you an actual reason to care about an NPC character for once in your life. Not only is Elizabeth a great character, but she makes the already great gameplay even greater. In other words, in combat, Elizabeth does all the boring stuff for you. For example, Elizabeth will search around and toss you some ammo, salts, or health, and the whole transition simply makes the gameplay feel very smooth, natural and worryless.   Although BioShock Infinite excels in almost every way, the story and the visuals are what carry this great game to it's hard-earned 'Game of the Year' nominee spot.

The pacing is excellent -- gameplay flows into and serves the story. The game has a complete story without feeling dragged out.  The story itself is captivating and keeps you engaged the entire time. I always wanted to know what would happen next. The events that happen in the game are meaningful and contribute to the overall narrative. Your companion, Elizabeth, is a character that definitely grows on you as the game progresses. While the details of the story may be complex and sometimes hard to get, it is ultimately fulfilling once you grasp it.  However, the DETAILED setting of this alternate-early-20th-century-steam-punk-sci-fi-fantasy game is what sets this game apart. Enter a world in which political, economic, social, and religious satire is rolled into one imaginative world. Everything from the dialogue between NPCs to the propaganda on the walls-- to the statues and architecture, gives the player a deep sense of immersion. The game is bold enough to delve into sensitive social questions. If you are interested in this kind of alternative setting, then this game is a must have.   Just a couple of notes:  -The gameplay is linear, as it is a story-driven game. However there are different side areas to go into, and things to see and collect. -There is no save button, but each chapter is saved and there are checkpoints.  -Check out the Burial at Sea DLCs. It continues the story of Elizabeth after the events of this game. (Highly recommended that you play Bioshock 1 first, as the story is connected to both games.) If you liked Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinite, the BaS DLCs are a must buy.    Get this game/10",

            "review_text": "This game... oooooh this game. I cannot express with words how I feel towards this game. This game is the best example of video games as an art form, and I could not pick a better contender if I tried. I could have said any of the Galactic Cafe games, or a Souls game, but this game has lots of engaging gameplay unlike walking simulators. This game has more of a storyt than just tatters of a story strung together by vague dialogue and item descriptions like Dark Souls. This game... it's in a league of it's own. It's in a league occupied solely by Bioshock Infinte.  Bioshock Infinite, like its predecessors, is a FPS developed by Irrational Games. It is about a distopian theocracy where the main character is sent to retrieve a young girl by the name of Elizabeth. A lot of unimportant stuff happens, you get targeted by the police force, everyone's attacking you for a while, yadda, yadda. And then you actually meet the other half of the focal point of this game: Elizabath. I'm going to skip the rest of the plot beacause you really, REALLY need to experience the rest of the plot for yourself. All I can tell you is that the story alone is worth the price of admission. Every character has motivations, goals, personalities, social ties, morals, philosophies, purpose. The characters are amazingly fleshed out to the point of feeling real. And trust me, you'll soon wish they were.  The graphics and music in this game are absolutely marvellous. I (finally) finished the original Bioshock recently, and noticed that, compared to Infinte, which I had played before, Bioshock had a very drab and uninteresting enviroment. With pile of rubble here or there, smeared blood every five feet, whether it be on the walls, floor, ceiling, glass, table, Steve from accounting, you name it. The colors are very dark and often blend together. Both games look stylized, but the difference was that the palettes of Infinte are much brighter, and (most) areas are in sunlight and not ruined. While I still really liked Bioshock above many other games I've played, the enviroment's coloring dragged its quality down for me a lot. But this isn't a review of Bioshock, now is it? The music compliments the enviroments beautifly, and while they reuse certain 'battle music' all the time during gameply, you will probably regard it more as an enemy signal than background music.  And now, for the gameplay. Frankly, I think this is the weakest part of the game. It's still a solid part of the game, but it gets overshadowed by a mile by its other components. I think this is the part of the game that I liked the original Bioshock for better. You can only hold two weapons at a time, and my god are there weapons. I think there are something like 15 or 16 weapons in this game, and you can only carry two. Sure, it makes more sense, but in the original Bioshock (I swear, I'll stop referencing Bioshock now) you carried a wrench, a pistol, a tommy gun, a shotgun, a grenade luancher, a camera, a flame/liquid nitrogen/electric-ooze-stuffthrower, a crossbow, AND THE AMMO FOR ALL OF THAT. I just find it wierd that they limit you to two when you have the oppurtunity to add WAY more guns to the players arsenal. The enemy AI is usually ok, leaning on the side of stupid rather than advanced. That said, even on normal, they can seriously pack a punch. This game isn't frustrating, but it is certainly hard. I'm a veteran gamer through and through, but even I died a good amount in this game. There are definetly parts that I might not have been able to get through without exploiting a few vigors and guns. Oh yeah, plasmids are still a thing, only they're called vigors now. I thought some of them are cool, but a majority of them feel useless. Also, Elizabeth helps you during battle. She isn't a liabilty, because she always seem to find cover and doesn't thow herself into enemy fire like some 'companions' in other games. She throws you ammo, health, and salts (EVE). Like I said, gameplay's the weakest link of a adamantium chain.  10/10 Absolutely my favorite game to date. The story is gripping, the characters feel real, and the ending will blow your mind. The enviroments are beautiful and vibrant, the music is fantastic and compliments the enviroments and story events. The gameplay is plentiful, engaging and challenging. This game certainly has flaws, but you probably won't notice as you are experiencing the game. Notice how I didn't say 'play'.   I know this review will be lost under the pile of words, pictures and sounds that is the internet, but all I can ask for is that this game isn't.",

A somewhat disappointing aspect to the gameplay is the inability to go back to previous places like in the original, although it would have probably felt out of place to go backwards. More minor disappointments include the removal of ammo types, and the inability to carry more than two guns at once, however, one could easily argue that these changes are necessary in this particular game. Like previous BioShock titles, I had a lot of fun searching for hidden items that either help my character or provide elaborate details to the plot and the city. Overall, the gameplay was great.  Story: This game tells a complex, immersive, deep, and meaningful tale about politics, racism, and religion; family, companionship, and abuse; and perhaps most importantly, choices, consequences, and redemption. It contains some of the most real, lifelike characters I have ever seen in a video game, and when the game was over, I didn't know what to do with myself (well, that's not true; I simply started the game again). The fact that you get a first-person perspective on this story makes it all the more awe-inspiring.   Graphics: BioShock Infinite has some of the best graphics I have seen to date. With that being said, it's not just the quality of the graphics that makes this game so visually appealing. The whole immersive environment is full of bright colors with dark undertones. Even though this game takes place in a completely different environment than the original BioShock, I can definitely tell that it is part of the same series. The developers really went above and beyond when connecting the game's setting to the actual graphics. For example, a city in the sky would see much more clouds than a city down to Earth, right? Well when certain events that call for suspense appear in gameplay, it might be accompanied by an ominous fog. At other times, the sun might be out, and it's as bright as a western. You can tell that genuine artists worked on this game.   Sound: While there are so many aspects that go into the sound of a video game, perhaps the most noticeable was the voice acting. These actors poured their hearts out into their roles. Without getting into detail and spoiling it for everyone, there are parts in the game where I can tell the voice actor/actress is actually crying while recording his/her voice. There is something about the way these actors tackle their role that makes their characters seem so hauntingly real. A less noticeable aspect (but just as important) is the music. The soundtrack for this game sounds like a professional movie soundtrack. The music is a perfect accompaniment to the characters and events that it compliments. Seriously, I don't know how this game manages to do so well in EVERY ASPECT. Just as a side note, the Songbird sounds terrifying and awesome.  Play Time/Replayability: It took me about 16 hours to beat this game on my first run through, which some say is too short. However, adding more play time to the game would dilute it as a whole. It does have a great deal of replayability, such as 1999 mode for the hardcore gamer (not horribly difficult). Overall, I didn't mind that the game was a bit shorter than average, because I was so satisfied with what I got.   Artistic Direction: This is where the game REALLY shines the brightest. Everything about this game contributes to its status as a work of art. All throughout the game there are characters, posters, or even structures, artfully placed to show the dark and sometimes racist intentions of the people of Columbia, trying to create a utopia. BioShock Infinite picks its themes and sticks to them. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this game is the recurring hymn, 'Will the Circle Be Unbroken'. This song has a subtle presence at important moments all throughout, whether it is sung, hummed, or even fit into the game's music. This hymn perfectly relates to the plot and characters of BioShock Infinite.   Final Comments: This is the best game I have played in a long time. This game shows everyone else in the video game industry the right way to make a sequel. The bottom line is that a great deal of thought and care went into making this breathtaking masterpiece, and it shows.",

The game starts as something dark and twisted and ends up as something darker and even more twisted, that is what I adore about it. Bioshock isn't linear, it is constantly shaping itself into something different and unique. However the story did get a tincy bit tricky to follow towards the end but will leave you thinking for a good few hours. Appart from the exceedingly great story, the shooting mechanics were quite fun to use. Start with some gun play then mix in a little paranormal powers to dispatch your foes in a manner of fun ways. Unfortunatly I did find the ADS key binded a little weird for a shooter, but that could just be personal preference. There are many RPG mecanics too, such as the upgrade vendors, these help you progress through the game a bit easier. After reading the review I have written I feel all I really wanted to say it.....

            "review_text": "After a few years and well over 150 hours played, it might seem redundant to write a review, but what the heck. I love BioShock Infinite, but I'm also frustrated by it. This game could have been genre-defining, it could have been a revolution. Unfortunately all the best intentions and biggest budget in the world couldn't achieve the lofty goals they set.   The thematic elements are genius, how they turned their limitation of linearity into a beautiful story and theme of its own, but at what cost? As much as I still enjoy re-playing the game, the gorgeous art and top draw acting can't disguise that the underlying systems don't mesh with what they're trying to do- the mass murder just doesn't feel appropriate to this setting (these are regular cops and downtrodden folk coming at you, not jabbering zombies or mutated monstrosities) and Infinite's gunplay is lackluster compared to even other entries in its own series. Which means some parts are a bit of a slog to get through, and you often have to mentally divorce the moment to moment gameplay from the overarching story.  Like the original games, the floating city of Columbia is the real star of BioShock Infinite, and it's a wonderful place to visit in all its multi-dimensional incarnations, looting every container in sight and picking up audio diaries as you go. While there are indeed moments of quiet, like exploring a sunny beach or roaming the amusements arcade, most of the time you're fighting your way through the place.   That wouldn't be so bad if the fighting wasn't so dull, with encounters being quite frequent and always playing out similarly without much in the way of enemy variety and no ability to plan before battles. I mean, you CAN lay down traps with Vigours, but this uses up too much juice to be very practical for much of the game. All enemies are openly hostile, there's no middle ground like with Big Daddies, stealth is useless and you can't carry around extra weapons or resources like health packs. This leads to frantically scrounging through trash cans and corpses in the heat of battle to find health items a lot of the time. Eventually you acquire enough Vigour powers and gear upgrades that the fighting starts to become interesting, but at that point you're nearing the end of the game. Still, it's all pulled off with a fair bit of pizazz using some seriously cool effects (flaming electrified crows!) and a wonderfully reactive soundtrack that plays little stingers when you get headshots and the like.   Your main goal of course is to rescue Elizabeth from the city, and she is an eminently likeable and believable character that shows real emotion (in cutscenes). Out of cutscenes, Elizabeth is completely ignored by EVERYTHING, even though she's what they're after (okay, with one exception, when she's abducted OFF SCREEN). She rarely feels like a real person outside of very specific interactions during actual gameplay, reverting to a glass-eyed automaton for a lot of the time with none of the dynamism or responsiveness shown pre-release, falling well short of expectations set in the same category by Naughty Dog or Valve. Her story's great, her design is mostly great, the voice acting's great (if a bit breathy), but she's just not very well realized in the actual GAME part of the game. In combat, the mechanic of her randomly throwing you supplies is also pretty awkward. After 100+ hours I can kinda predict when it's likely to happen, but there's definitely some randomness as to when she'll bother to toss you that vital vial.   Maybe I love Infinite more for the dream of what it could have been, than the actual thing they delivered, I don't know. I think back to the original vision demo that Irrational produced, which promised untold freedom of combat and reactivity from the environment, plus a potentially much more interesting Elizabeth whose powers had more variety but were also hazardous to her health. The reality falls a bit short. It's still a very fun theme park ride of a game, held together with some top notch storytelling, but the environment is very nailed down and smaller scale than one would expect and you kinda have to grit your teeth through certain sections.   Although I feel we saw barely half of their original intentions come to fruition, what we got to play through is still awe inspiring, moving and thought provoking. For comparison's sake, if Mass Effect 3 failed due to being rushed out and designed by committe, Infinite is the polar opposite, where years of complete freedom led to a mess of gameplay elements that never quite gel or reach their full potential but still make for a compelling, if flawed, experience.   They failed trying to do the impossible and I find that admirable. Definitely recommended.",

            "review_text": "Hello boys and girls, step right up and experience Bioshock Infinite - The one and only video game to feature graphics that appear more stunning than the graphics in real life! That's right graphics-obsessed mainstream gamer crowd, get your salivary glands as hyped up as the fanboys of this here game, because you're in for the ride of your lives through the first literal shooter on rails!  Yes, you heard me right - this game is the first shooter on rails to actually involve shooting while on rails! As you glide gracefully through the air without ever fearing for your life, you will find yourself pitted against fellow rail-riders that will also be firing at you as you fire at them. But don't worry! This game is more than ready to account for your lack of an attention span, and will gladly reduce the odds of you getting shot while riding on these rails to next to zero!  Be prepared to be awed by this game's incredible involvement of the theory of relativity, which will leave you, like many fanboys, baffled and confused with its remarkable ending that completely forgets the grandfather paradox! But don't question the lack of thought put into its use of time and space, nor how people can live in a floating city like this without passing out from low oxygen! None of this should matter when you're rapidly firing a rocket launcher, and being hit in the head with a wrench by a girl you just saved!  But graphics aren't all this game features, it also boasts amazing features never seen before in video game history! Features, such as; Racism, skyhook assassinations, firefights on rails (as mentioned before, but it's worth repeating!), classical music, crazy religious people, and most of all: Elizabeth's magical ability to pull weapons and money from thin air!  Mainstream shooter fans rejoice! This game, unlike the others in the franchise, realizes that you're too simple-minded to possibly keep up with multiple weapons, and so it limits you to only two at once! Don't worry about figuring out which two weapons you like - they've gone out of their way to make sure that only a small portion of the handful of weapons available are actually useful in the game, so you'll be just fine!  So throw your science book out the window, forget Einstein existed, and prepare to enter the floating city of Columbia through the eyes of Booker Dewitt, he's just your average ex-military gun-wielding father who is able to immediately go from retrieving a girl for a 100% legit client, to taking on an entire army of soldiers! Become immersed in his epic tale, as he rescues a Paris-obsessed girl named Elizabeth, who shows absolutely no respect for our clearly trustworthy protagonist, and will not think twice about running away, or otherwise physically harming him, despite the fact that he is the only reason she ever escaped at all!  So join the hype train, and buy Bioshock Infinite - your eyes will not regret it, but your mind might!",

The game does take a commitment of time to complete but not from any real substantive depth only from the exponentially increasing enemy HP bars.   It may have been worth a second go if there was any branching from the supposed choices you are presented with, especially since grabbing all the voxiphones and kinetiscopes on first try would be tricky, but the game is so much on rails and makes you very much aware of this that it's not really worth the bother of a second playthrough.  But don't let me seem too critical, it is a marvelous looking game and may be worth a playthrough if you can pick it up on heavy discount.

Taking the gameplay from the underwater city of Rapture to the skies and it's own city, Columbia, where you play as a private detective sent to rescue a girl being held there. I won't go into anymore details as the journey is one worth taking and finding out for yourself. The city of Columbia, much like Rapture is beautifully designed and fleshed out. The combat is visceral and fun, with the use of 'vigors' rather than 'plasmids' (same concept, different powers) from earlier entries in the series. The variety of weapons is excellent and the upgrades make a difference. Later in the game you'll be able to move around on sky hooks and attack enemies by pouncing on them or shooting them while moving. Very roller coastery and pretty satisfying. The characters are well written and the voice acting is absolutely top shelf. Elizabeth is one of the better characters in video game history IMO. The end is a little odd and wasn't so black and white but I was satisfied with it. Overall I'd highly recommend Bioshock Infinite.

Wasn't it a really bad idea to remove the weapon wheel from the first place ?!?! For a real Bioshock nutfan like myself, YES IT WAS !  Very limited types of enemies. You fight the same enemies over and over but with different uniforms. Don't expect variety as in previous titles.  Nothing beats a carefully planned fight against a big daddy !!  Using the sky rails was a HUGE AMAZING ADDITION, but not enough with all the removed classical Bioshock stuff.  No more hacking ?!?! No more lock picking ?!?! Lousy choice of weapons and VERY FEW USELESS weapon upgrades compared to previous titles.  I didn't even realize there were side quests !

Although it was challenging, it wasn't the selling point of the series. Though to be fair, stuff like this will always need a starting point.  As far as Burial in the Sea - Part 1 goes. The nostalgia factor is definitely there. The story was too short even for a multi-part DLC and it does not warrant the price tag. You are better off buying the season pass. Despite the shortness in content, I can't argue that it is extremely well-made. From the fine details in rapture to the alternate timeline, you are definitely getting top quality from Bioshock Infinite.

            "review_text": "+ Powerful story, narration, characters and voice acting + Great settings, environments and visuals + Lots of details and polish, items are thoughtfully placed around and every bit of level design made sense to me  Gameplay-wise a rather brainless shooter. Not exactly a Call of Duty, I guess, but not very far from it either. I was playing on the 'Hard' difficulty'. Lots of guns and powers to use, but I found my favorites somewhere in the middle and never touched the others again. Sometimes you can interact with the environment for example to set an oil puddle ablaze while enemies walk through, but these occassions are rather rare, and timing isn't always easy. It seemed simplier and easier to me to just fire my guns at them right away. The enemy AI felt rather bad. I could be crouching behind a small pillar or crate to wait for my shield to regenerate and sometimes none of the enemies would try to flank me. If they tried they weren't doing it aggressively enough but stumbling around before shooting leaving me enough time to take them out. There was a 'boss' who was harder to defeat because he would constantly spawn minions, and those Handymen kept pushing me around because they are are glued to your tail and hit hard in melee. There is no serious death penalty or sense in struggling harder though.  The skylines are either not always there or I haven't always noticed, so they not necessarily make up for the somewhat lacking combat. Freight hooks you will sometimes find too. But again: Why jump up there, possibly expose myself to enemy fire, to charge at them with my skyhook and dropping into the middle of some semi-open spaces - possibly exposing myself again -, if I can just take a small peek from around a small corner and do a headshot with a sniper rifle from a safe distance instead? I used the skylines to zip around if Handymen were closely behind me, and in some instances because it felt a bit epic doing that with gunboats around to drop on and harrassing their crew close up, but those moments were few and change little about the rail-ish nature of the gameplay.  I've seen the press apparently praising the AI and companion nature of Elizabeth. She is a great companion story-/narration-wise and I liked her a lot, she is nicely animated, her voice actress did a great job and she has an interesting personality (she is neither some stupid damsel in distress nor some oversexualized ♥♥♥♥♥ for men to stare at), but in terms of gameplay she is overrated. Some wrote she would greatly take care of herself. Actually no, she does not. It's just that the enemies pay zero attention to her. Story-wise capturing her should have priority for the enemies over killing me, the player, and yet there were a few instances in which she exposed herself to the enemies in silly ways. There is no real stealthing, but sometimes enemies aren't initially aware of your presence, and one time I was sneaking up on a few of them. They didn't notice me, but Elizabeth 'decided' to run up ahead in plain sight. Nothing happened. She just drolled back to me like these enemies weren't even there. If you don't pay attention to such things you may believe she was controlled by some smart AI, but I did notice and it's just not as fancy as some people put it.  Also, the degree to which she interacts with you is fairly limited. Yes, she throws supplies at you when you need them. But it's just a 'Hit button X' prompt. Yes, you can make her open 'tears' to spawn supplies, cover, freight hooks, decoys, environmental hazards and whatnot during combat. But it rarely matters much. And again: It's just you holding down a button when prompted. And Elizabeth can open locks, but again it's a mere prompt to make her do something that takes like a second. There is no real added gameplay value by her doing it. Booker could have done that himself. It's nice to have her do it instead, it sure doesn't hurt the companion idea, but I doubt it to be the massive edge and innovation in gameplay design as some reviewers or press representitives apparently believe it to be.",

After several playthroughs, and a complete understanding of ALL the gameplay mechanics, i discovered that, despite the more simplistic style of gameplay, i found it to be more enjoyable than the first 2. Don't get me wrong, Bioshock 1 is an absolute classic in every regard. Infinite has something going for it though: Vigors. I found myself using all the vigors in a single playthrough at some point. I cant say the same for Bioshock 1 or 2....the vigors were just that much fun to use.   The story took a playthrough or 2 to fully understand because i missed a couple minor details in the first run. It's confusing at first glance, but holds an amazing, and tearjerk-worthy payoff. The payoff feels bigger as a parent, without spoiling any plot.  9/10",

            "review_text": "It's not bad, but it is somewhat dissapointing.  Now, I know I did say I recomend this game, because it's a fun game with a great story, but it doesn't live up to what it could be. If there was an 'indifferent' option rather than just yes or no, I would have picked that. While I chose yes because this game isn't bad enough to deserve a no, I was dissapointed in the potential it had and didn't quite deliver on, and I'll explain why.  Bioshock Infinite tries to do a lot of things differently than in Bioshock. Is this a problem? No. The problem is actually that it didn't change enough. Bioshock was a completely immersive and consice expeirience. Everything about it - the story, the setting, the gameplay and machanics - worked together to created a single, tightly woven experience. Infinite stumbles a bit in that respect. It focuses a lot more on the story - which is fine, because the story is FANTASTIC - but the pacing doesn't change much from Bioshock to accompy that. The story is, at times, seemingly pointlessly interupted for battle sequences that are not well-justified by the story or setting. Not every battle feels out of place, and a lot of the battles are great, but just as many seemed added in just for the sake of having more action. Bioshock had insane splicers around every corner, so Infinite should too, right? But in the new setting, it doesn't feel as natural, and doesn't add to the expeirnece as much. On the subject of action, this game introduces vigors, which are basically this game's version of plasmids. Strange viles of liquid that give you weird powers. These were a central part the story and world of Bioshock, but really have no place in Infinate and feel as if they're only there because Bioshock had them. Also, looting in Bioshock made sense - the place is falling apart and you need to salvage to survive. This doesn't translate to the new, more utopian setting.  In the end, my biggest (and maybe only) complaint with this game is simply that they tried to do too many new things, but then tried to keep too many old things as well just to be safe. It ends up feeling halfway done, with the story and world changing a lot but the machanics and gameplay unwilling to change to match. It's saddening, really. If they had been willing to change all of it to match the new setting, it would have been amazing. Instead, it's okay.  Now, before you go thinking that I hate this game, it is not bad - just not as good as it could have been. The combat is fine, although rarely adds much, but the story and world are both stellar. Ininfite has a bigger focus on characters than Bioshock did, and thus a bigger focus on story rather than just atmosphere, and the story is really, really good. The setting, while it does seem at conflict with the machanics at times, is beautiful. It's fun to explore and learn about, just like you'd expect from Bioshock, with a different take on the distopian world gone wrong feel, as you arrive while the utopia is still thriving. The world and story does not dissapoint. It's fresh and new, but still has that Boishock charm of wonder mixed with unease.  In the end, I only dislike this game because I wanted to like it more than I could. In the words of a passive-aggressive mother, 'I'm not mad, just dissapointed.'",

You electrocute your enemies and watch as their heads explode in a shower of blood. You unleash crows in the midst of a group to distract them and follow up with firey plasmid bomb that turns your crows into more bombs! explosions for everyone! Its all over the top and gleefully bloody. I enjoy it immensely. The only downside here is that you are limited to 2 weapons.

You are beaten by waves of minibosses to situation 'no health, no ammo, no power for 'magic' '.     only 2 weapons with limited ammo - limits fun and available choices how to win a battle    after the first shootout living town in the sky is suddenly empty except for enemies. Kills atmosphere and ... where and how did civilians disappeared?    'spells' sometimes fail to work when needed   My biggest complain is, that there are moments when you cannot outrun, outshoot, outmaneuvre, outsmart your enemies. Also, some proposed uses of 'spells' as landmines are useless - many times you cannot bait enemies or it is easier to kill them in assault.  Anyway I enjoyed the game a lot and I am seriously thinking about replaying it - with slightly different approach. Just to try to exploit the possibilities even further.

Mechanics: the gameplay in Bioshock Infinite is rather simple but fast paced and interesting. you make use of guns, your skyhook and vigours which are basically the plasmids from the first two games. most of the action is just shoot, zap, smash repeat with the exception of when you use the skyrails to fly arround the battlezone. the combat varies slightly based on what weapons you get your hands on, for instance the shotgun is a medium damaging close range weapon, while the machine gun does light damage from a distance, while if you get your hands on the rail gun you will wreck untill you run out of ammo. overall the combat is a 7/10 because its fun and fast paced but lacks variety.  Story: You play as a man name Booker Dewitt who is sent to the flying city of Columbia to save a young woman named Elizabeth ( she's kinda a big deal in the game ) who has been trapped in collumbia since she was young. the story contains many jaw droping plot twists and keeps you engaged untill the credits roll. the story rates a 100000/10 for being one of the greatest stories ever in video game history.   So should you buy this game, Hell yeah its freakin awesome and will keep you engaded untill the end. Warning you will fal in love with Elizibeth.",

But on a more serious note, The PC version is definetley a better experience (if you have a decent computer) and includes better graphical settings, better performance, and just overall smoother gameplay.  Bioshock as a series is a first person horror(ish) single player shooter. It has an amazing story in every game and the gunplay feels incredible, especially when being mixed with the large variety of supernatural 'powers' (called Plasmids in 1 + 2, called Vigor in Infinite) There's a slight trace of survival in the games, as you're always looking for ammo and looting every little crevice for some health packs and maybe some salt (basically mana).  Bioshock Infinite really was a huge step-up from the previous games. The story was way more driven out and detailed, the movement system changed, along with the gunplay, the graphics, and even the setting. I honestly don't even want to say what these are and describe the world, because it's an amazing experience if you just jump in with no knowledge other than 'first person shooter' and 'good story'.  To this day, 3 years after the release of the game, I can positively say that Bioshock Infinite is one of the best story-driven FPS ever.",

Yes, might sound weird to picture her both as a pro and a con, but the huge limit on 'her' interaction with the world is the fact that every action of hers is kinda scripted and she was actually invisible to enemies. 1999 Mode: I felt homaged being a SS2 fanboy but, cmon, this is not the way to implement a realism/hard mode, it's actually just no ammo and every shot must be an headshot or you're screwed.

What really woke me up was the ending of the game, the way how they used time, illusion and universal continuim to show how the same event happens again and again and again in different universes and time periods. It was so fictional that it made me think for a second how the ending made sense and made me want to see a review and clarification on the ending.

The gunplay is satisfying and the vigors are fun, but the enemies lack variety and the level design is based around hallways and corridoors, with the illusion of freedom because of the setting.   As far as the world goes, this game does it all right. Everything feels right in its place. The voice acting is fantastic and the story does a stellar job tying the series together. (Note: By series, I really mean the original Bioshock and Infinite, two is left out as far as story goes, which is fine.) I'm not going to say this is a bad game, because it isn't. It's an okay shooter with a great world and fantastic story. If you haven't played a Bioshock game before, I would suggest Bioshock 1 and 2 before this.

            "review_text": "We all make choices, but not in bioshock infinite!  All I can say about this game is it is not a bioshock game. It is, a monstrosity created by Ken Levine, that was branded 'bioshock'. During it's development, the game and it's story were changed around multiple times, leading to this mediocre, non bioshock game.  I only recently played through the series, and had high hopes for infinite as the other games were amazing. My friends who had played through it said it was the worst, and i didn't believe them. But, they were right  The Good: It isn't all bad, the game has wonderful graphics which allow the new scenery in this game to be absoloutley stunning. Along with the graphics, a few neat mechanics were introduced such as new plasmids (known as vigors), the skyline system which allows you to slide on a rail (this was very well done), and the clothing system. Theres also the edition of a free roam in the city feature, where you just look at stuff before your an idiot and show you mark of the devil to someone. These areas are some of the best in the game, but are very limited in number    Sadly the good parts are limited  The Bad: Ken levine said himself that he asked your regular xbox dudebros to play through bioshock and he then asked them what could be improved. This is the result.  Core bioshock mechanics: Unlike the other games in the series, there are no little sisters or big daddies. I (and many other people who enjoy the series) were expecting some sort of 'columbia-fied' version of these things, instead they were simply removed. No little sisters, no adam, and no big daddies. You can't upgrade your personal stats such as health, armor, or salts (eve), with anything other than random hidden bottles, any special abilities are unlocked by clothing rather than adam, and out of TEN plasmids EIGHT are handed to you. This may not sound like an issue, but IT IS A BIOSHOCK GAME. Theres also the small issue that half of the plasmids are useless or are exactly the same.  Next we have weapons and weapon mechanics. The weapons in this game are terrible. In other bioshock games, the weapons are vastly different. But not in infrinite! Yes, these weapons are all different, but they all feel the same. There are quite a few weapons as well, but the pistol and the rifle feel the same, the shotgun and revolver feel the same, THEY ARE BORING AND BLAND. In the first two games, you'd have things ranging from a tommy gun to a crossbow. Oh yeah, thats another thing; the weapons don't fit the time period! Every weapon in this game exists 30 years before it was created in real life, this wouldn't be an issue but they are all real weapons! Anyway, in this game you have generic weapons that aren't special in any way whatsoever.   The mechanics are also awful. Ammo is VERY easy to get even on hard mode, and enemies LITERALLY WALK INTO HEADSHOTS. This makes the gun play boring, and also repetitive.   Upgrades are even worse, unlike the other game where there somewhat of a visual difference and usually soem cool gimmick after fully upgrading it, these upgrades are just flat out stat boosts.  Oh, i almost forgot! You are limited to carrying TWO weapons. That's right, two! This mechanic was a futile attempt at making sections harder by making you pick up the appropriate weapon type (make the upgrade system worse), but it doesn't actually matter, as headshots are so easy to get, so a pistol and carbine can get you through the entire game.  Also, forget about set enemies, just fights waves of them off!  Next enemies and ai: The enemies in this game are as bad (if not worse) than the guns. Throughout the entire game you fight the same enemies. Police, tankier police, and mini bosses. These minibosses are what i assume to be the stand ins for big daddies. You have patriots (robots with miniguns), firemen (tanky guys that shoot fire), crow people (i dunno), and handymen (tanky berzerkers). But these just don't work. They are basically thrown out in every few fights, but barely make a difference as they only take 10 or so extra shots to kill. They also have no reason to exist, unlike big daddies. THe only time enemies change is when (spoiler) the rebels turn on you, but all this does is give the existing enemies are nice red paint job.  CHOICES: The bioshock series has always had one core element: CHOICES.You could either be the man that kept his sanity within rapture, or you could become what you were against. Would you do anything to get to your daughter and set a bad example, or be a good rolemodel? In this game there are no choices other than some random attempt at sybolism with the twins. Heres an example: Only 20 minutes into the game, there is a choice. You can either go along with the racism and throw a ball at a mixed race couple, or throw it at the announcer. WAIT NEVER MIND YOU THROW IT AT THE ANNOUNCER NO MATTER WHAT.   Other stuff that doesn't deserve its own section: Hacking=gone. It was replaced with a plasmid thats ultimately useless, as the machines you hack turn on you after a while anyway. The hacking mini games were always a little clunky, but they were just apart of the series. Open worldishness=gone. bioshock was never really that much of an open world game, i mean more free roam. In the first two games, you could roam around an area and do whatever you want. See a big daddy? Put some traps down before you fight it, hack the security, make it your own arena. This game dows have some of that, but because these areas are filled with innocent people that scream if you cough, it just doesn't work.  THE STORY (SPOILERS, obviously):  (lot less spoilers after this section) I'm going to sum up the story really quickly. You play as booker d*uche witt, a guy who owes a debt and needs to find a girl so he can pay it off. She happens to be the daughter of a prophet that is the leader of a giant floating city that broke away from the u.s. because of political differences. Everyone here happens to be racist since its 1912. After breaking thi girl out, you find a way to escape the town, and fool the girl into thinking you're taking her to paris. She ends up finding out about your plan but decides that the both of you two should just team up to get out of dodge. Then portals and deepness and 'look how philisophical it is guys' WAIT A MINUTE SHES actually YOUR DAUGHTER YOU JUST FORGOT BECAUSE REASONS AND PORTALS AIGHT? Then she kills you.   Main Issues with the story:  Racism: At the start of the game you are shown a beautiful, vibrant city. It looks like paradise and it is. WAIT! they ship all the black people to finks place, fink offers them work and they live under ♥♥♥♥♥♥ conditions, because its better than getting lynched, and even though you could just leave at anytime the black and irish population (which from the perpective the game put you though is about half the population) live in slums. Then when they rebel and stop living in slums the paradise turns to ♥♥♥♥.   The racism part also carries no weight because the only reason you help them is because they take your ship.  'so deep man' Everyone says the story is deep and philisophical. But it isn't, at all. It just ends with your genericy alternate universes concept which isn't anything knew, and is done in a stupid way. There is also just a bunch of random garbage spouted about physics and atoms and time threories, but to anyone whos watched an episode of those black hole shows on the science channel will know it is bs.   Conclusion:  Is this game a bad game? No. It is very well done. But in the end, it isn't a bioshock game. It's just a cahsout targeted at dudebros and gamergurls that has bioshock in the name and some bioshock mechanics.",

In addition to it, although sort of repetitious, the gameplay is quite funny and exciting. For those who can't forget the Plasmids, it'll be an even more fantastic experience. Not to mention the Sky Trails.  I could end it here, but it would not be fair : there's something missing. There's someone missing. The start, the middle and the end of the adventure. The ends and the means.   Elizabeth.  I'll tell you something: since Alyx from Half - Life I haven't felt that way for a Game Character. Elizabeth is adorable, yet very clever. So fragile, yet kinda devious. So young, yet so clever and mature. It's almost humanly impossible not to fall in love with her. But not in a man-woman way. Something more pure. Something more true, almost intrinsic. A very strong bound, but I can't go on talking. You have to feel it yourself.  Well, after all this, here goes my most sincere appeal: Play it. It's worth the time. It's worth the price. It's and endless world of possibilities for you. Immerse yourself in it. Find Collumbia.   Find the Infinite.",

For most of the game, you won't be alone. Your companion, Elizabeth, certainly deserves a separate paragraph. As far as game characters go, she is one of the best I've ever seen. The acting represented by both voice and animation is superb and the character itself is quite deep and interesting. During your adventure, various weapons and powers (vigors) will be available to you. Weapon variability is decent, though not staggering. I got the impression that in the end it matters very little what weapons you use (you can only carry two at a time) because they can all become quite powerful through upgrades. I'm not saying a rocket launcher is the same as a sniper rifle, of course. This can be both good and bad. Good because you can choose weapons based on your playstyle (for example machine gun X rifle) and if the two weapons compliment each other well you won't have to change your mind later. Bad because you probably won't have enough money to upgrade more weapons if you do change your mind. But that's a minor thing that you can certainly plan for. The vigor powers are, well, OK. I ended up using only two or three of the supporting ones. For attacking you're mostly fine using weapons. The final thing I'd like to mention is the story. Even though it's not very original and doesn't actually make sense :), it's presented is such a way that I didn't really care and thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall great game, highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "An ambitious game that checks a lot of boxes. Some better than others. This is a 'spiritual' successor of the first BioShock. The setup, gameplay, and story is very reminiscent of the first yet manages to be its own unique entity. Even though I enjoyed playing this game more than the previous BioShock, the first one is a more complete game and story.  What's amazing about the first BioShock is how it tells the story in everything it does -- gameplay, enemies, NPCs, environments, etc. The level of detail is amazing. Infinite is similar in scope and scale yet there are many things that go unexplained. The simple explanation of your powers is not covered at all. And why don't any of your enemies have the same powers? There are a lot of glaring omissions like these throughout the game, yet it's only because the game tries to tackle so many things that most games, movies, and even books don't even come close to.  While with its own faults I found the world of BioShock Infinite a world I constantly wanted to return to. The first Bioshock is completely terrifying. I remember playing the first one for 15 minutes and not picking it back up months afterwards because it was so terrifying. Infinite, while sinister, is much more colorful and ideallyic. Your side character does a lot to carry the burden. She's remeniscent of Disney's Belle from Beauty and the Beast. It's an amazing attempt at creating a side character that doesn't get in the way and is also likeable from start to finish. The failings of the side character feel more like the the constraints of the technology and less so than the constrainst of the creatives. Overall it works.  At its best, gun fights are a blast. You'll swing from skylines, have brutal melee kills, and the powers your acquire are more lethal than ever. About half way through the game it becomes a little monotonous and easy the more powers you acquire. While still fun, it never transcends is core mechanic. The environments and set pieces get really creative and exciting. But it feels like the creatives behind Inifinite are tired of this same old shoot 'em as well and are more interested in fleshing out the rest of the world. The burdnes of creating a AAA title.  The most interesting parts are when you're walking through a town and seeing the citizens go about their daily business. 'Social norms' are turned on its head; pulling and blending from historical past and fictional altered futures. The expansion of the world is also executed through many collectible audio-tapes and viewable old timey movie machines. While creative and well-done in their own right, I don't feel like these break up the overall flow of the game. They become more annoying that enriching. That being said I'm glad they're in the game, I just wish there were more scenes that you play through, rather than 'recordings'.  The ending, that I won't spoil, is terrific. It really does save the game from being a rehash of the first. It easily goes down as one of the all time best endings of a game. The ending is enough to replay the game to see it with new eyes.  BioShock Inifinite is a great game that feels shackeled by the confines of AAA pressures and constraints. If only those shackles were released would we be getting a game that defies expectations. I'm glad Ken Levine and company have moved on to new pastures as their newest work is bound to be ahead of them.",

Strengths:  Bioshock Infinite creates a rich atmosphere and engaging environment, made complete through enjoyable protagonists. Progressing through the game provides a variety of engaging settings and areas in which you're able to learn the history and creation of Columbia. Slavery and religious undertones play a key role in creating interesting world as the player is constantly bombarded with conflicting viewpoints. Also enjoyable was the mixing of United States history in sort of an 'alternate reality'   Weaknesses:  Gameplay. The game does little to further the franchises key mechanics. Plasmids are simply replaced by tonics, most of which are not very exciting.  Upgrades and 'character progression' remain the same and are very bland overall. Typical increased ammo, increased damage, reduced recoil, faster reloads are all included for most guns, but do not present any improvement from prior games. Some upgrades to plasmids... I mean tonics, are fun, and can change gameplay somewhat, but most are fairly typical.  The new addition of 'Gear' in which you equip pieces of that have a variety of effects on your character were a nice addition, however I felt they fell flat. Again, most of the bonuses were fairly typical. I would have liked to see an effort made to include gear that drastically changes your approach to the game rather than remain the typical shooter (perhaps a gear set to become a fast melee tonic using madman or a stealthy sniper rifle using shooter).  Aerial combat was also a new addition, which was ok. I felt like it was supposed to be a main focal point of combat, but in the end, was mainly just used to escape and dodge attacks as your shields recharged.  The 'warping in' of different items to assist you in combat was also just ok. There was no ramifications of choosing to warp in one item over another. You can warp in health packs to heal up, then go back to warping in a aerial turret to assist you, then warp in a hook to provide mobility. Would have liked to see some ramifications involved from choosing to warp in a certain item.... i.e. you warp in that aerial turret, you lose for the entire fight the mobility of the hook for instance.  Final comments:  Overall, despite the relatively standard gameplay I enjoyed the immersion and story of the game and would recommend the game to shooter and Bioshock fans. 3.5 / 5.0       ",

I think in part it has to do with the fact that Infinite feels like it's more story than gameplay. The gameplay isn't bad. It just doesn't feel inspired. Bioshock 1 &amp; 2 had about a dozen powers and a lot of sub-powers you could configure, plus hacking/stealth aspect. Infinite drops all of that and gives you six main powers, and about two dozen or so sub-powers which can only fit in four slots. All in all, it just felt rather simple, even with the ability to ride sky-rails, and it didn't hold my interest.  The checkpoint system was rather annoying, and the loss of cash on dying should have been a hard-mode option only. I particularly loathed the fact that the game put me in this fun looking sky-city world -- and then punished me if I decided to take a leap off a ledge and see what was there. Psst: Developers, I would never have this complaint if you implemented a true save/load mechanism.  The story and visuals are top notch. But this game feels like a Hollywood blockbuster to me; All style, little substance.  Despite that: The world of Columbia didn't feel as real to me as Rapture. Rapture was a disintegrating utopia filled with criminals driven insane by their mad desire for perfection. A world of gibbering splicers running amongst the feet of prowling Big Daddies. It was a circus nightmare and you were thrust into the middle of it.  But Columbia? It was a nice, ideallyic 1950s American dream (yes, including the blatant racism). And then you come in and tear it all down. Because of that, I didn't feel sympathy for the protagionist. I guess the devs were hoping for a 'YEAH SHOW THOSE RACIST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S, GO IN THERE AND SMASH THEIR FACES IN!' vibe, but honestly I find that far less interesting than entering a world already driven mad by its corrupt philosophy, as was seen in Rapture. I want to see Columbia fail on its own, because of its terrible premise. I don't want to actually be the cause of that failure.",

Carrying only 2 weapons was also a bit annoying but nothing really bad. Also by the end I just wanted the gun parts to stop because after like 12 hrs of them I just wanted the story to advance.  Which takes me to the story... Oh...my...god... Even without the ending (which made my head explode) the story is amazing and the characters feel like they are real people with flaws.

Also I hope the theory of hearing the Songbird's death in Bioshock 1 is true, If this was intended since the beginning it would be 10 times more cooler. ",

It's not a terrible game but it's not a good one either, just a very very generic fps with fireballs in it and a very platonic and boring plot about how capitalism is baaaad.

Too bad companies like Bioware and Valve aren't in charge of making every fps game. Anyway, it has pretty standard weapons for the most part and cool vigor skills and lots of blood and violence which is always a plus. Possession is my fav because I love possessing big enemies and watching them ♥♥♥♥ing beat down regular enemies. The story isnt bad either, nothing special but it works well. One of the best looking games ever and it is a lot of fun. I guess some fans hate this game because it isn't exactly like the previous games. Boo hoo. I think this game is tighter and more solidly put together than the first two and is more fun. There are slight stutter-skipping issues sometimes but not often. Otherwise it runs fine.

The story itself is full of twists, logical challanges, humurous yet tricky dialogues, humor. This game will test your wits in combat and will challange your intellect to fully grasp what is going on. The game is definetly in top 10 of best games I've ever played. It's not boring. The main story is very interesting, has unique atmosphere and on top of that there are two story based DLC's entitled 'Burial at the Sea EP1 and EP2'. The spoilers will be skipped but this game is too good to be avoided. Everyone should play the game at least once to experience this something, that many games nowadays fail to deliver.  + Replayability value for STORY and gameplay + A lot of action and combat + Unique atmosphere + Main campaign lasts for 10 hours (95% complete walkthough) + Obviously not photorealistic graphic, nevertheless it's very pretty and colorful + Sounds in game are plentiful but not messy, quite fitting music to the game world + Two story DLC's that take place before Bioshock 1, kind of introduction.  - Game tends to stutter and one has to find fix on google - Numerous bugs on 'Burial at the Sea EP2' - Antialiasing: dont enable it is FXAA which blurs image ruining its quality. Makes textures blurry and not clear to see, blurring hits negatively color palette and the worst thing, it's less effective than MSAA x2 in any other game.  Neutral: There are some choices in the game, but it's linear. Nevertheless the game is not boring at all and is very enjoyable.  To sum up my review, this game is an unforgettable experience that may make one think about the plot or even replaying the game again and again. 9/10 It's best to buy the game with season pass in a bundle on sale for 16€. Even with the full price of 50€, the game is just worth it if you're fan of great and unforgettable story in games.",

The whole game is beautiful. The graphics are perfect. The quantity of different weapons are awesome. The many plasmids (special abilities) are very creative, and fun to use. I love searching around for ammunition, gold, silver, dollars, and searching corpses for goodies also. Do not just follow the (N) arrow, search the whole area first, this is a huge open world game. Every area has easy to use vending machines, where you can buy anything you need, but choose wisely. Bioshock Infinate is a real gamers Dream. I bought it on a one day Steam Sale, and later bought Burial at sea on sale. I highly recommend both. This is the best of the Bioshock series, and a must have for all real gamers. Whether you pay the full price (worth it), or get a big discount on a Steam Sale, buy this game ! I forgot to add, that the voice acting is superb, as are all sound effects in Bioshock Infinate.",

Down below I will say what I think was good about the game and one or two things I thought was little worse.  So start of with the bad things since we don't want to get all to hung up on the good things and forget the bad,  Bad: The story in it self is kinda blurry and very hard to understand at first, you really has to search more in to all of the game to understand it completely, I haven't even understood it to a 100% yet even tho I have asked my friends what they think, and what other people overall think. Many says different things so that makes it obvious that it is not the easiest story to understand. All though that might be a good thing for alot of people since they sort of can make thier own story about it.  Good: First of a Huge wow to the graphics. Such beautiful enviorment and looks on the game. Also the game really makes you an addict to it, I said after playing 7 straight hours 'I have to take a break, just gonna finish this quest' then I realise that I am still playing another 3 hours later. The story is just breathtaking, you just have to love exploring the worlds the way you want it and how you want it. And to get to know the charactors, either like them or maybe even start feeling like you may even start to feel for the charactors. Bound with them and create your own memories with them.  It is a long game took me about 13 hours to complete. (If you discover alot of the stuff and absorb what you see) And all 13 hours are just a blessing to play, you feel VERY empty inside after you have finished the game. I can tell.  So what score would I give this game? I'd say 97/100, highly recommend the DLC's for this game if you enjoyed the story. Is it worth 30 € ? Duh... yea big time. If it is a sale, you are stupid if you don't buy it if you like storytelling games. This game is one game you HAVE to play before you die!",

Narratively inconsistent, the writers couldn't pick a theme to focus on between Columbia's corruption and rampant racism and Elizabeth's power and the two did not mesh well. The racial implications alone of there existing a dichotomous Easy to Spot Racists and White Saviors proved that the writers were painfully ignorant about what racism actually looks like in the relevant modern world and even in early 20th century America. The racist caricatures and attempted 'satire', when satire is supposed to expose the flaws and absurdity of the oppressor, not shove racist caricatures at me until I become uncomfortable became so overbearingly blunt and disgusting that I wasn't even halfway through the game before I uninstalled it.  Hugely disappointing game on its own, even more so when comparing it to other games in the series. Gameplay offered nothing new or innovative that the other's didn't do better, the hand-waving of Vigor users being perfectly fine while splicers invariably develop an addiction was lazy and ignored the basic premise of the entire Rapture narrative, and the visceral satisfaction of decapitating white supremacists wore off fast when I was forced to participate in murdering a Black woman who was portrayed as equally evil to Comstock even though she was not at all on politically or socially or economically equal footing with him and had not systemically enslaved and oppressed people. It's as though it never occurred to the writers that people wouldn't relate to Booker overcoming his white guilt, because clearly all of their players are white men who need to be pandered to. Because slapping a fat Hispanic boy in a sombrero and a poncho and labeling him as part of the Foreign Horde is something Hispanic players encounter on a daily basis and we don't need 'satire' to tell us how stupid it is when my dad got called a beaner by a customer at work. I regret buying this when it was on sale for $10, it wasn't even worth the spit I wasted cursing this abomination. I hope we get to see a return to Rapture one day and find out what happens with Eleanor or the world post-Rapture, but until then I am avoiding any future titles out of this series.",

As the game goes on, you, the player, will come to discover the true story behind the person you are playing as and the story of other important characters. Taking place in the city in the sky (Columbia), your mission to get this girl will result in your involvment in other peoples' lives, and it'll change the person who you play as, who you'll partner with, and everone else around you.   Unlike many first person shooters, this game comes with a wonderful story, and yet, it maintains its acclaimed gloriness of Bioshock with the classical use of powers and guns.   If you have watched trailers and video introductions to the game, you could notice that one of the biggests accomplishments of the game is the usefullness of your partner Elizabeth. You don't have to defend her from getting shot or crushed to death, for she hides behind walls and pillars that are not to far from you (plus she doesn't appear to take any damage at all anyways). When you shooting enemies either with your gun or shock, Elizabeth will provide provisions such as ammo, salt (the 'fuel' used to provide you powers), and health packs to make sure you can keep on fighting. Also, outside of battles she will occasionally toss a coin to you. In some occasions, you'll find Elizabeth's presence will prove most helpful both in battle and in the sole story line too (I'm trying not to spoil things here. Just look at the trailers. They can explain her usefullness pretty well).   She just isn't a worthless character in the game; she'll one of the greatests partners you'll have.     All-in-all, the game is wonderful, and I definitely recommend the game to all of you. However, the ending is quite confusing at first, which is the only major negative thing I can think of about the game.   The implication of first person shooter with powers, the lovable characters whom you'll not easily forget, and the awesome story line 9.3/10. Get the game!",

You got some good challenging fights in this game which is a good and exciting thing.

When you finally think you have gotten away you get thrown back again at least 3-4 times which get's really frustrating after a while. The story in general has been dragged really long with the same stuff and it feels like they don't have anything more or new to offer.

It's breathtakingly gorgeous with some unique quirks; but the depth and complexity that made the first two games so satisfying is absent from Bioshock Infinite.  Long review, There are things about the game that are fun and interesting, but much of the gameplay is disappointing. It really is a beautiful game if you have a computer than can run it at full capacity, and some of the weapons are really fun and feel great to use. And the skyrail is amazing; it doesn't make any sense as to why it doesn't rip your arm off and why you can reload and shoot a sniper rifle one-handed while flying through the air -- but it's a really awesome mode of transportation and can be really handy in a fight.  They also changed the maps so that it's more linear and there's less exploration, and the combat system kind of sucks. I like that you can only have a couple guns at any one time because it lets you use some strategy in how you play. But the enemies are bland, like they didn't know how to make the game more challenging, so they just threw in a greater number of enemies, and you don't even have to use the vigours (the plasmids of Infinite). In fact, the vigours don't even feel like they fit in the world at all. There's one that allows you to control an enemy to fight off other enemies -- and then they kill themselves after it times out - which is disgusting and extremely horrible and entirely unnecessary.   Beyond that, though, the story and the characters are very one-dimensional in comparison to the first two games The pacing is very slow in the middle of story, and they just kind of drop major characters from the beginning because they didn't know what to do with them at the end. I don't want to say too much about Elizabeth for those who haven't played the game yet, but she starts out really cool. But then she just gets really annoying and turns into a fetch machine. She also progessively loses clothing throughout the game which is gross for more than one reason considering the relationship between Booker (the guy you play as) and her. Elizabeth is not at all the strong character she's made out to be, and is certainly not a strong female character. She has little to no agency in the world except to be annoying, and continues to be a damsel despite the fact that she has amazing powers which she could use to really kick ♥♥♥ - if they'd let her.  The plot is exalted by some for its stunning originality, insight and complexity; others just find it very confusing. Actually though, the plot, and especially the ending, is a dazzling display of 'let's confuse the player to make them feel like this is a grand and original plot; we went too slow in the middle of the game so if we confuse them maybe they won't see through the massive black hole sized plot holes and paper-thin construction of this story.'  The first two games were really good because they were thought-provoking and provided a critical analysis of important topics (capitalsism vs socialism, power, socioeconomic class, parenthood) while still being fun and not feeling preachy.  Bioshock Infinite tries to approach topics of race, prejudice, oppression, and revolution; but it approaches these issues flatly and, in the case of race, very irresponsibly. Racial discrimination is a complex issue and although they try to show that it is a horrible thing, they ended up creating an offensive environment rather than providing a platform to think about and discuss deeper issues. This is possibly because the team developing the game was likely all or mostly white, and as much as they wanted to, they simply could not explore issues of race in the needed depth and complexity because those are not challenges that they, being white, face everyday.   So, while Bioshock Infinite is beautiful and is set in an awe-inspiring city in the sky, while it has a few really cool things that make it fun (some parts of the story, the skyline, some of the vigours) it's dragged down by its own success in that the developers lost sight of what really makes Bioshock amazing.",

I know I'm the minority here but hear me out. I loved the first bioshock. It wasn't a perfect game by any means (repetitive late game) but the atmosphere, large variety of weapon/plasmid options and story were fantastic. Then comes bioshock infinite, a game that takes almost everything the first does right and throws it away.   I'll start off with what I liked: -interesting world -great atmosphere -great voice acting  -shooting feels a little better than in bioshock 1  Now the bad: -Poor story that when crtically analyzed is completely illogical  -Lack of meaningful decisions. There's parts in the game were you have to choose between two options. Your choice doesn't affect the outcome of the game at all.  -The game scraps the multiple weapon options of the first bioshock in favor of a two gun limit that's present in almost every other modern shooter. This is one the worst offenders. There's even a weapon upgrade system in the game but it doesn't matter since you'll probably have to drop the weapon you've spent a ton of resources on upgrading.  -These are more subjective but the vigors aren't as useful, interesting or unique as the one's in the first game. The handyman fights also feel very scripted and aren't as fun as the big daddy fights from bioshock 1.   Conclusion: The game isn't horrible but it certainly isn't the masterpiece the overwhelmingly positive reviews seem to suggest. If I had to score it I'd give it a 6/10. It's mediocre or average at best. There are way better options for both gameplay and story. Save yourself some time and skip this one. I'm about to delete it from my hard drive right now.",

It's cod style gun mechanics of only holding 2 guns at a time that you can switch back and forth from is stupid, like, whose idea was it to ruin the way you toted 9 guns across the world fighting crazy battles to, you have 2, good luck.  Not to mention the crap ♥♥♥ plazmids or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they're called in this game. It's just not worth the time to deal with them, the guns work just fine in the place of them.  I will say, I did enjoy the whole zipline mechanic, that was definatly a great plus in my mid, but then the gunplay just isn't satisfying at all. I would rather just use the pistol from Bioshock 1 the entire game then have to deal with any of the guns from this game.  And then theres the story, which is so predictable its sort of a joke. At least in the other Bioshocks you had a choice to see how it ended, bad, good or somewhere in the middle. In this it just ends, and you die, which is stupid.  I wont say 'don't buy this game' but buy all means do, but you really should go play the original two first, they, by far, are real bioshock games, this game doesn't even deserve the title bioshock.",

An interesting world world was built, with a whole oppressive status quo thing going on, with poverty, religious cults, and an underlying creep and corruption factor. A bright and vivid city among the clouds, a setting ripe for exploring. Too bad they ditch it halfway through for some trite and overcomplicated nonsense that leaves you wondering if you should even care what happens next. The setting gets shaken up far too may times for you to feel invested in anything anymore, which is massively disappointing.

Most of these are pretty good.  - You're restricted to only two weapons at a time, which I think gives you a more realistic FPs than one where you can lug around an entire armoury on your shoulders. - New vigours or plasmids. These mix up the special powers into something much more imaginative and magical. - No more fiddling around with gene splicing. This game makes the process of upgrading yourself a bit simpler. You can have as many upgrades as you want active, provided you have enough coin to buy them. There are some 'magic gears' that you can get and wear. I'm not entirely sure I like them, as they randomly generate and are hidden around levels, but they provide extra abilities if you want them. - Sky Hooks. One of the great things in this game is the sky hook. This, with the lines you can zip around on and jump everywhere give a sense of freedom to the environment that takes advantage of the fact that this game feels very 'open', even though it's played fairly linearly. It reminds me a lot of what I felt playing mirrors edge. - Much larger levels. This game has much larger levels and gives you more freedom of movement between them. It also makes good use of 'tears', which allow you to modify the combat field in imaginative ways. - Elizabeth. The game introduces what I think is one of the best 'companions' in an FPS I've ever played. She provides you help in combat that goes beyond just shooting back at enemies, but actively scouts for loot so you don't have to. The game also makes use of some pretty good AI which, even though Elizabeth is just following you around, makes it seem as if she is actively makign choices on her own, and actually feels 'alive'. Given all of these changes, I feel as if the game play in this game is a great improvement on the previous bioshock games.  Story:  This game takes a big departure from the previous bioshock storytelling. Rather than following someone on a radio, you are more directly involved with the events that are playing out before you. This game has a pretty deep story, that I won't go too much into because of plot spoily reasons, but it involves a lot of great themes like   parallel universes, family relationships, and hard choices.   Plus, the characters in the game all seem to be very real, and rather than having your standard villain that you need to beat, everyone is on a spectrum of good to evil. The game also helps to add depth to the story by the use of tape\\record\\video collecting to tell the stories of some background characters, if you want to seek them out, like in previous games.  Graphics: The graphics in this game are amazing. The environments of all of the structures are beautifully crafted, with buildings that give a real atmosphere of everything from a lived-in 1900s american city, to a civil-war style battleground, all surrounded by steampunk floaty island-ness. The main characters have some great design to them, both from a perspective of their general appearance, and the design of the costumes\\clothes\\armour they are wearing. I did see a fair bit of copy\\paste in the background civilians, but the game did include a few stand-out background characters even though they appear only briefly [like the barbershop quartet]. The post processing was a bit much at times for my tastes, but that can be fine tunes if you want.  The worst part of this game: Checkpoints. Checkpoints are awful. The previous games allowed you to save anywhere you wanted, but this game restricts you to only saving at given checkpoints. This provides a problem as if, like me, you like to explore every nook and cranny of a level, you can spend a long time between checkpoints. And if, for life reasons, you need to take a break, your options are all awful. Quit and lose all progress; pause the game and leave it running, hoping your computer doesn't crash or suffer a power loss; run ahead to the next available checkpoint and miss out on all combat, as when you reload your save next time, the enemies will not respawn. It would be great if someone at 2K games were able to implement this, but unfortunately, you're just going to have to deal with it.  That aside, overall this game is great. One of the best I've played in a long time. Great if you like FPS games, and can be played independently of any previous bioshock games.",

            "review_text": "Credentials: Played through Bioshock completely several times, played Bioshock 2 with 100% completion, and now have played Infinite thoroughly taking my time to examine every area, listen to every audio log, watch every video log, and closely pay attention to every plot element in the game.  Bioshock Infinite, I will be referring to it as Infinite from now on, is a beautiful game with very deep and rich lore and plot. The game also runs very smoothly and Infinite's gameplay is very fast-paced and strategic. You can use the various weapons and vigors (plasmids from the first two games or essentially scientific magic for those new) in combination to overcome your enemies.   (DON'T WORRY. READING THIS WON'T SPOIL THE GAME) Infinite's general plot briefly: You play as Booker Dewitt. A man forced to find a girl and either willfully or forcibly return her to New York. Doing so would wipe away his massive gambling debt. Booker isn't your average protagonist. He is a man who lived a crooked life often being hired to scare or attack workers who refused to work do to unsafe conditions, low pay, etc. However, he is also a man filled with regret and depression.   Unfortunately for Mr. Dewitt, he might have bit off more than he can chew. When, he is sent to Columbia, a post-civil war American city in the sky. While this city might be beautiful on the outside, it has a very ugly inside. Columbia is a city consumed by nationalism, a radical altered version of Christianity created by their 'Prophet', and xenophobia. In Columbia, if you are not of Anglo-Saxon descent, then you are a lesser creature. Racism and xenophobia are celebrated in Columbia. They make a game out of showing hatred towards couples of different race and even have attractions of heavily stereotyped cultures to either get a laugh or a scare. This is thanks to their 'Prophet' and his heavily altered version of Christianity that depicts the white man as the pure and superior race. The poor don't fair much better here either as there is no such thing as worker's rights, minimum wage, or unions in Columbia. The poor have to demean themselves by bidding their pay, break time, or hours against others to try and get a job.   Booker faces many hurdles and challenges in order to try and complete his job.  Pro's/Con's:  -World is very immersive. -Combat feels fast and accurate. No bad mechanics to make you scream at the screen. -Amazing voice acting. Booker feels like a real person. All of the supporting characters do amazing as well. -The girl he must find, Elizabeth, is possibly one of the best female characters that I have seen in a game.   Her model is not over-sexualized and her personality is realistic. This is one of the few times the damsel in distress isn't   portrayed as a helpless dainty child-like woman. -The A.I. of your in game ally is actually helpful. They either spot out useful items, pick up things you might have missed   to give to you, or toss you much needed supplies that you can't reach when your pinned down behind cover. -The game's plot is clear and at the same time deep. (SORTA SPOILER?) Only the ending, might cause some confusion.   However, it gives you a lot to think on and if you don't understand something the ending has been explained in depth   on various sites. -Visuals and performance are great. I ran the game on almost max settings with a GTX 760 2GB VRAM and pretty much   never had a noticeable frame drop except in one specific area which is very open and the drop was very small and barely   noticeable (which is possibly the most annoying since they don't warrant changing your settings). -THEY ADDED HATS!! Ok in all seriousness they actually did add hats that you can't see though. Clothing in the game   acts as combat modifiers.  -Tons of secrets and side-quests to do. This game highly promotes exploring.  Con's (Mostly nitpicking):  -(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SPOILER) There is a scene after the credits you will miss if you skip them. This scene changes   the ending heavily. -One vigor allows you to have an enemy machine become friendly for a short time. You can use this on vending   machines to have some money come out of the machine. This will agro the entire area. Everyone will act as if you just   fired a gun or shot a bolt of lightning from your hand. Doing this may cause you to miss cool in game scenes of citizens. -(NOT MY OPINION) Unlike the first two you cannot carry every gun at the same time. You are limited to two guns that   you can swap out. They probably used this system to allow them to have more guns in the game and I am fine with it,   but some people have complained. -Weapon upgrades are once again present in the game. However, they make no sense. Since, you can drop your weapon   and pick up a new one at any time having your weapon upgraded you just picked up doesn't make sense.  -Weapon upgrades don't visually alter the weapons. -Vigor upgrades use cash instead of another resource like in the others. This presents a problem mostly because they   are so expensive. In my play through I purchased only a few I really wanted and still didn't have enough money to   upgrade all my weapons. Not even close. -Vigors also seem slightly less interesting in this installment the previously and some are introduced when you only have   a few hours left of gameplay. You will probably use a few of them and barely touch the others. -Too many of the clothing modifiers alter melee or skyline combat. If you play on harder difficulties melee often isn't a   choice.  -Some of the secrets in game require you to first learn of the secret before you can find them. Even if you see where a   secret is and find a button or hidden switch you can't use it until you find a recording mentioning it. -No hacking like the originals. A vigor takes place of it.  Overall, the game is a must play. It has an amazing story and visual environment. Unfortunately, my pro's list might seem short compared to my con's list, but I had to be vague to avoid spoilers. Many pro's you need to discover for yourself and like I said my con's are mostly nit-picking. I was never bothered by any of them except for the one about the vending machines. Since, your character is so strapped for cash it sucks deciding whether to get some extra cash or experience more story.",

Good things: It was fun, the story was engaging and the world was unique, it gave a nice open-air feel as opposed to underwater.  Bad things: People were too bullet resistant. I think this changes on the easier difficulties, but on the hardest (not 1999 because I hadn't unlocked it) you would be shooting someone from the the Columbia PD 3 or 4 times in the head before they died. The sky hook thing was a nice game mechanic, but I never understood and still don't understand how a spinny metal thing on your arm lets you run and jump 30m through the air and grab onto a hook. Why it doesn't dislocate your arm at the elbow and the shoulder is also a puzzle. When Booker is holding two handed guns, he suddenly doesn't have the massive metal thing on his arm, but when you melee he swings his arm out and there's the sky hook. The front sights and rear sights were way too large on all of the firearms, and realistically you could not shoot accurately with them. The weapons were a little weird, with some of them quite antique for 1912 and others way ahead of the time period. This was explained via the tears though. I've seen the video about how everyone would be throwing up from motion sickness, and I won't elaborate on that. It seems that the only currency in Columbia is the Silver Eagle, which you spend like dollars in the 21st century. All the signs that have fireworks and popcorn at prices like 10c are meaningless unless you have those coins.................you don't. Like all games of this type, there's the ability to carry thousands of coins the size of your palm around in some kind of mega wallet that doesn't make you move like a snail, need I say more? Fink has all of the workers making the manufactured goods, but where does the fresh fruit come from? I see oranges in baskets, and yet I see no floating agricultural area anywhere in game or on the map. There are quite a lot of people in Columbia, but they don't really seem to do much apart from look at the various monuments or talk to each other. There are the shops and businesses, but not much in the way of employment for everyone else. In that time period it was common for the rich to live off inheritance and investments, but it's not like the economy in Columbia could thrive without trade.  Honestly I could go on for a thousand pages and I think I'll leave it there.  The game was fun but the society/world/city would not work. I couldn't ignore the listed problems and it kind of ruined the experience for me, but maybe it won't for you.",

Words cannot describe how much I love this game. I bought it on Xbox 360 and then again on Steam because I loved it so much.  The environments are vivid and breathtaking. Columbia feels like a moving and breathing place from the second you step onto the first brick. Something Ken Levine really excelled with here was atmosphere, you can feel the city watching you, you can feel its emotions. What is even better is some of the videos that accompany this game that look like they're from a documentary from mid 20th century. This story and setting is so well done that you might actually believe Columbia was a real place.  The combat hasn't changed much since the original Bioshock, you get your plasmids (vigors) and your guns. Lots of fast paced action and explosions. Much fun to be had. You will learn to fear the enemies in this game! (Play through on the hardest difficulties for the best experience).   Elizabeth brings so much life and fresh air to both the story and the combat. She aids you in combat, without getting in the way what so ever, escort side kick done right 100%. The story in this game is mind blowing and you absolutely will not see it coming (hopefully you haven't heard any spoilers, but even so, don't let that stop you!).  Her story will fill you with a mix of emotions from joy to melancholy but you will love every second of the ride trust me.

No matter how much I think I'm done with Bioshock I have to play the games over again. Each time I play this game I learn or understand the plot more than the last time, making me want to to do it over and over and over yet again. Every word and every detail mean something. The characters, you won't forget their names. Trust me. Same with the other game, as each personality is unique and just makes you want to learn more. Thank you Ken Lavine for your creation of Bioshock. My advice is to play all games in order. Especially if you expect to play the Burial at Sea DLCs you MUST know the other games. No this isn't some market scam to get you to buy some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game from the past. It adds so much to the story, more depth and more character development that lets you fall in love again.

Which is a damn shame, as the kill animations are quite decent and the game really invites for interesting ways of taking down both single and groups of enemies.  However sad, it seems only focusing on weaponry (rather than fun stuff, and mind you - everything here costs money/ power ups you have to pick between) will actually give you an advantage in boss fights. Which is sad. Because the funny powers are fun but rather useless. Literally worthless.  I recommend a god-mode cheat and then explorering the various ways of killing things while holding hands with Elizabeth.  All in all... wait for another 75% discount. UNLESS you love scenery, decent story writing (this is actually insanely uncommon nowadays - I'm looking at you, ♥♥♥♥♥-tier CoD games) - and couldn't care less about the clumsy, terrible, agonisingly slow combat system.  Not gonna throw numbers at it... great-fun/10 would buy DLC @ .7€ (and the game itself at 75% discount seemed pretty decent as well, considering how many hours of fun (with minutes of sighing frustration from made-by-someone-of-mental-disability-putting-him-at-the-level-of-a-toddler-with-downs and poorly balanced boss fights-probably-for-same-reasons) I've actually had with it.",

One of the strong points of Bioshock was undoubtedly it's setting. Rapture was a captivating and unique environment to explore. Columbia is, well... lacking. I stuck with it for the supposed remarkable twist ending, which in fairness is very good, but the journey there was hardly thrilling. Only being able to wield two guns was a complete pain in the rear.  I personally found Bioshock Infinite to be a hollow experience, style over substance. When you find yourself in Columbia for the first time and begin to explore, you'll be thinking that this is going to be something REALLY special. Ten hours later however, when you have killed the same enemies for the zillionth time, looked at the same buildings, rode the same rails, and played through essentially the same action sequences over and over the gloss tends to wear off.",

Bioshock Infinite is a first-person shooter, but you aren't just armed with guns from WW1 and 2, you are armed with Vigors, like the original Bioshocks Plasmids. You can zapp people with volts of electricity or charge at them with quick speed.  Bioshock Infinite isn't afraid to magnify the way religous and racial extremisim can change our lives.

Whether that be the beuaty of the world that the game is set in. Whether it be the understated beauty of its story. Or whether that be the beauty that is found at the heart of the relationship that is formed between the two main protagonists.   The story is masterfully crafted, and contains more twists and turns than a rollercoaster. Ironically however your journey throughout Bioshock Infinite could be likened to a rollercoaster as you are never left to wander in a straight line for long. You are constantly moving on to other bigger better twists in the road and it is a journey that every gamer should experience. No matter what your personal preference is, Bioshock Infinite has something for everyone.",

This game doesn't rely on scaring you with some atmospheric tricks and jumpscares. This game makes you think about things that most people don't want to think about. It's an absolute mind♥♥♥♥ at times, which can be much more disconcerting than any Splicer jumping from around a corner.  This is truly what Bioshock is meant to be. It's supposed to make you question humanity's quest for constant self-improvement as well as each individual's own search for self worth. What makes a person good and what makes them bad? My only irk with the game is what they did with Songbird (you'll understand).",

Columbia feels forced and the NPCs feel very robotic and puppety. The abilities and weapons feel like the same old gameplay renamed to be catchy. Instead of having 'incinerate' you get 'Devil's Kiss' etc. The whole game just feels forced.  The part that probably irks me the most: This game was postponed YEARS so they would have time to perfect it. Instead, on Ultra PC settings, this game still has screen tearing. The water looks worse than it did in Bioshock 1. And we are left with a bad taste in our mouth at the end of the game because the story was not imaginative.  Overall, even with all of its flaws, it is still fun to play. Just not as fun as the first two.   I give Bioshock Infinite a solid 7/10. The hype destroyed this game more than anything.",

            "review_text": "If you are looking for an experience similiar to the original bioshock, you are not going get it here. Bioshock 1 was the anthesis of 'the perfect game' it was, and still is one of the best and complete packages that you can get for 60$.  With it's sequel 'infinite' (and no bioshock 2 does not count, it was amde by other developers) it seems that irrational took out S.P.E.C.I.A.L points in various areas and put them into very specific categories. Where Bioshock 1 was a game where everything was great thus projecting the image of 'the perfect game', Infinite has some areas that are glorious where others are alright.  Bioshock 1 had various elements that made it great. Compelling, Diverse and Intelligent Gameplay, an fantastic open world and a very appealing narrative. And it excells in all of these areas perfectly.  Whereas Infinite has a Different, Diverse but not as compelling gameplay. Infinite plays like DOOM in a way that it is designed so that the player is forced to constantly move. In doom you always have to run around regardless if there is any room to run in. Wheras Infinite is focused on forcing the player on constantly shifing positions.  Firefights in infinite usually go like this. Encounter enemy &gt; take Sky Line &gt; Position in area &gt; shoot guys &gt; Repeat. There is ovbs more meat aound this structure like weapons, elizabeth, gear, vigors (plastids) etc... But unfortunately BSI suffers from the same thing that many fast paced shooters are plagued from and that is, without proper design fast game play is very hard to make compelling. The only franchise that I have played that has succeded in this was the original DOOM and 2016 DOOM.  That is not to say that the game play is bad, but when stacked with Bioshock 1. As a fan it is very distasteful. But as an outsider or as someone who actually has a life it's simply two different ways of play. It was impossible to intergrate BS1 combat into BSI's world. It was not going to work and I think that the decision they made as a good one, although I feel that they should have added more depth to preparation for fight. For example putting traps on sky tracks, etc....  The vigors are also back and IMHO they are very underwhelming. I have never touched charge or undertow. Chances are you will really only stick to Shock Jockey, Bronco and the shield one. As they are very inexpensive and very convenient. Stunning players is very vital in these games and these casts allow it to be done easily. That does not mean there is no place for the others they are accomodated for. But when the game provokes you to constantly shift positions, it would be stupid not to pick the casts that slow your foes down.  The world is subjective. Simply put whether or not you liked rapture or colombia will be one of those debates that leads down to taste and taste only. Irrational has managed to protray these worlds excellently, and giving the player the opportunity to explore them thoroughly. If you are looking for a compelling world with good lore and are openminded to concepts other than what is presented in bioshock 1 then there is no doubt in my mind that you will like this as well.  Lastly story. This is where I think bioshock infinite surpasses Bioshock 1. And by this i mean main story. Both games offer significant amounts of lore content, and we can go on forever about which one is better. But Bioshock Infinite's narrative as a game surpasses Bioshock 1 in every single way. You will see more or less that same elements from the previous narrative, the only difference is that Infinite builds up on those elements. People tend to like BS1' characters and story more because it's a very dark and scary game (for puss ies) and thus it sticks to them more. But Infinite does not have scary thing for it to rely on. Bioshock 1 was very grim, most of it's characters predicated themselives on something really ♥♥♥♥ed up, making them extremely memorable. But when it comes to the actual lore that YOU do as a character, it simply boils down to 'escape rapture' sure there are a couple of other things to care about, but fundamentally the point that the story wants to drive into your squall is that you want to get the ♥♥♥♥ out.  And infinite does almost the exact same thing. But offers me more things to actually care about. Everything is very in your face, its very bold and it's not scary. Character are very ideologically driven and not just crazy and whether or not youl ike the former or the latter more. One needs to understand that Bioshock Infinite predicates its story around a gripping and emotional narrative. In BS1 you are more or less alone, and this was good for a dark shooter. But BSI is a polar opposite and offers a more bombastic duo in the form of Booker and Elizabeth. The dymanic between these characters if fantastic and how they play along together in the game is glorious. There are even the lettuce's which are just a joy to play with. And thne you got your Fitzroy and Comstock which is baiscally Atlas Vs Ryan. Everything in this world is extra and it's great that it's there.  Unline BS1 where it was really only about 'you,you,you' What really drives the narrative home and what makes BSI better than BS1 narratively is that connection you have with Elizabeth. Elizabeth is the main character of this story, you play a secondary role as booker. This story makes sure you know that. Elizabeth is the bread and butter of this story, and she ties everything very nicely. Now this may seem like a bad thing, a narrative that revolves around one person especially when there is such a bit and diverse world, but thankfully Irrational adds outside elements like what i mentioned in the previous paragraph, and in addition how pleasant Elizabeth is as a character.  Although she does provide a small role gameplay-wise. Elizabeth is by far one of the best written characters I have ever seen in a video game. I have been playing games since I was 4, from ut 99 Lan Parties with my dad in 2000-2001 to now. I have yet to see or experience a game with a character that makes me so happy. Elizabeth is by far the most human character I have seen in any game ever. Her voice, her child like composure, her sympathy and slight ignorance makes her an extremely easy character to root for. She interacts with you constantly in the game and it's great, she pokes at you constantly and it spawns interesting dialogue between your character and hers. It's is geunienly fantastic. She leads this game, she is the reason that you should buy this game. It's honestly hard to explain unless you play the game for yourself, but all i can say is that the tension between you and her along with the adventurous tone of the story, works flawlessly. Surpassing BS1 narratively in every single aspect.  Overall, if you are looking for a compelling, dramatic, thoughtful narrative. Look no further. Unfortuneately if the game play was put to such a level as the narrative this game would of blown BS1 out of the water. But im glad that both of the titles have something unique that make them enjoyable. And I love both of the titles for what they are. Just fkn buy this game man,  ",

But the best part of this package, no matter how strong everything else is, is it's story and atmosphere. As a fan of things like Lost, Twin Peaks, Alan Wake, etc., this game's story shines.

While I still think this game is amazing, it is a bit underwhelming since 1. they removed any horror element remaining from 2 and 2. the game is pretty linear. While linearity isn't bad per say, it just makes it feel like one spot to the next without giving you a chance to explore. While you could say Bioshock 1 was linear, it at least gave you the option to return to some areas of the game and finish up stuff in those areas such as rescuing or harvesting any remaining little sisters. The ending can be a bit annoying since it pretty simple, but has a rather big reveal within the entire story. The main story is good and I personally loved being in Columbia, but I just wish there was a bit more familiarity between the three games since Infinite will be the last one done by Ken Levine. Now onto Burial at Sea pt 1 and 2. One of the best pair of DLCs I've played through. Not big enough as expansions, but they make the entire series of games go into the a complete circle. It is HIGHLY recommended you play Bioshock 1 (and if you want 2) before you play Burial at Sea. There is a HUGE reveal at the end of part 2 and it may make you cry like I did. Overall Bioshock infinite is a 9/10 if you include Burial at Sea. Its a 8/10 if you don't have Burial at sea. If anything, buy the complete collection coming out later this year since you can get all three bioshock games as well as their DLC for $60 which is basically an amazing steal and price for the three amazing games they are offereing.",

There are very few games I play for the story, but this is one of them. I've heard that some people find the combat fun, but I do not. The reason is simple: I play everything on the hardest difficulty from the beginning, but BioShock simply raises enemy health and damage, which is frustrating. If you play on lower levels of difficulty, it's too easy, but higher levels require more bullets and more spells rather than more skill. Any combat system that requires more than one headshot to kill a human enemy is a combat system I will not enjoy.  Even so, it's easy to recommend any of the BioShock games, just don't bother raising the difficulty.",

At time of writing (around 10 hours after the UK release on March 26th 2013), I finished the 8+ hour campaign in a single sitting around 2-3 hours ago after no sleep and I'm still trying to mentally process the experience in order to evaluate it. While this might not immediately sound like the best mindset to have when trying to writing a review, I felt now is the best time as this post-game mindset perfectly reflects my feelings towards Bioshock Infinite as a game: breathtaking, awe inspiring, thought provoking, complex, deep and utterly brilliant.   Ken Levine and the team at Irrational Games have outdone themselves once again by creating yet another extremely inventive, inspired and interesting game world inhabited by intriguing and believable characters. As hard as this may be to swallow for some players, Columbia and it's inhabitants are far more developed and enjoyable to spend time around than Rapture, to the point where standing and watching the city folk go about their lives becomes an immersive highlight of the game. The arrival of a wide variety of interesting and developed characters such as Booker, Elizabeth, Comstock and Fitzroy is extremely welcome as the brilliant acting and stellar writing from the first game once again return, just with a much greater focus on personal character development this time around.   If, for some weird reason, you're still on the fence about whether or not to buy Bioshock Infinite, look at it this way. If you're looking for a deeply engrossing and immersive game world with astonishing visual design, fast paced inventive gameplay or an emotionally driven and complex storyline, look no further. While the game would've already been fantastic if it had merely replicated Bioshock 1, additional innovative design elements such as the social/religious/racial commentaries push the game that much further as a powerfully moving and artistic interactive experience, making them the added seasoning which makes Bioshock Infinite one of those few astonishingly high quality games that nobody should miss.   9.7/10 - Very Highly Recommended",

BioShock: Infinite is slightly less of a game, and slightly more of a critique on early-20th-century American culture and values. It plays like an interactive novel, and doesn't fail to deliver an excellent story, engaging characters, and pathos (ability to inspire emotion). Though the 'choices' the developers offer are more-or-less meaningless to gameplay (choose one design of necklace over the other), if you as a player read into those choices, they can become extremely poignant and meaningful. BioShock: Infinite, like its predecessors BioShock and BioShock 2, is an excellent game to analyze. It's also fun to play, though combat does get a bit repetitive, and you are restricted to only two main weapons and your Vigors (supernatural powers). Some enemies do not properly scale (you will wipe the floor with Vox Populi cannon fodder, but as soon as a Handyman shows up, you will be shooting him for the next ten minutes), and the game DOES get pretty preachy at some parts (because you are playing a character with a history, instead of your own customized hero) - and the entire ending of the game makes absolutely no sense unless you accept the possibility of the multiverse - but these are things you can ignore and focus on the good gameplay and storyline. In my first full playthrough, I didn't use Vigors nearly enough, so I'm looking forward to getting the Burial At Sea DLC and working on that.",

This story rich game will keep you on your toes for countless hours from start to finish.  Pros:  - Sleek style - Captivating environment - Absolutely lovely characters - Fantastic voice acting - Great gameplay mechanics  Cons:  - Occasionally cheasy vocal acting. Not bad, just humerous as it is typical in 2 small parts of the game - Shorter game than I would have liked",

            "review_text": "How should I put this... The Bioshock series are games where you needed to delve in them with an artistic mentality, Meaning they're all works of art. Bioshock Infinite, while somewhat differentiating in atmosphere when compared to the original 2, still carries the excellent plot and characters (large emphasis on characters by the way) that made Bioshock 1 and 2 brilliant.  The first 2 things that jumped out to me when starting this game was: 1. The music design- My god I swear as soon as I heard a Barbershop Quartet cover of The Beach Boys- God only knows, I knew this game was special as this was intended, not just as a tool but as a foreshadowing technique. Using music to hint at future plot is a hard thing to do and is commendable. 2. The Sidekick- To me, The sidekick of Bioshock Infinite is what Navi from Ocarina of Time should've been; Useful to both the plot and gameplay. Its abillities as a sidekick are varied from giving you health, money, ammo and salts (this game's version of mana) to opening gateways known as Tears which summon numerous equipment into the game's myriad plane.  Anyway if you are experiencing Bioshock for the first time, it is a FPS for the higher class citizens meaning it is free from bland storylines and 10yr old turkish boys who want to get schwifty with your mother. However no prepubescents means no online mode which is a shame as Bioshock 2 has this. What really makes the gameplay interesting are the skylines, allowing for fast-paced traversal and action, and the unique vigors, whick are essentially biopunk spells (My personal favourites being the shock jokey and murder of crows). These features, along with the variety of weapons, make the gameplay very exciting.  But wait, there's more as the story is gripping and littered with twists and turns that will boggle your mind like the peasants you all are. The only negatives I could say about this game is the brutal difficulty curve near the end of the game and the meh graphics.  Overall, I cannot recommend this game enough as well as it's DLC ( especially the Burial at sea story line). This game is best played firsthand otherwise it removes the vital charms this game. Additionally, if you're planning to play the series in its entirety, it's best if you start like this for the best canonical experience: Bioshock Infinite- Burial at sea- Bioshock 2: fall of rapture- Bioshock 1- Bioshock 2- Bioshock 2: minerva's den. Also keep in mind, you need to to keep an artisans approach when playing the series and think of Bioshock Infinite as a work of Picasso's and the rest as art by H. R. Giger. You may interpret that statement as you see fit but for now I'm going back to my whisky and cigars. Ciao.",

Though you can only hold two at a time. The weapons were a lot of them copy and pasted, (at least that is how I feel) but one has more power but you can hold less ammo. I mean it does not feel that fun to try out new weapons that you get, like it does in bioshock. Also where this game in my opinion suffers the most in gameplay is their excuse for plasmids, vigors. They were fun to use but I end up not caring about 90% of them. Only really using one. Which I did that in the original but the original seemed to have more thought put into them. It seemed as the vigors were tacked on only so people do not rage at the creators for not having these. Though it is a great game. The story though, it was great but hard to make out. Just what the ♥♥♥♥ was going throughout my head at the ending of the game. Just wtf. Also your escort. SHE DOES NOT SUCK!!!!!!! She gives you salt, (what you use to power your vigors) she gives you health packs, ammo, best of all, SHE CAN NOT DIE!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY A GOOD ESCORT PARTNER!!!!!!! It feels more like she is escorting you. Though when you lose her as an escort you realize how much you need her and you really have to try and find her. It sometimes feels like she is escorting you most of the time. The place you go through. A giant beautiful flying city in the air. It was such a beautiful place with amazing graphics and great atmosphere. Also near the end they nailed the atmosphere perfectly to the point where I just could not help loving the game. Though the original was better in my opinion this game is amazing you should get it. Also if you have to choose between pistol or carbine, choose carbine.",

The night I finished the game when I took my hands off the keyboard (knowing of course that this was the moment after the big final epic battle) we both just sat there in stunned silence as the game concluded itself. When the credits had finished rolling and the last tidbit of end-game material was gone, we still just sat there, silent, for at least 3-5 mins staring at the title screen and trying to absorb what we had just been witness to. We then sat up the rest up the evening talking about every aspect of what had played out and what we had done to get there.

Extremely basic spammy FPS waves that disorientate you as the 'music' and yelling assaults your ears. The gameplay actually reminds me alot of infamously bad 'Goldeneye rogue agent'. Towards the 3/4 mark, the enemies become bullet sponges. One of the smaller flak launching enemies took FIVE RPG rockets on EASY mode, which is the mode i played it on because i quickly realised i wanted to be done with it as soon as possible. The much praised 'innovations' were the skylines and the vigors. The skylines served only to confuse me as i attempted to rush through the game. The vigors are almost exclusively identical flashy reskins of 'grenade' and 'mine'. Finally the much praised story didn't do much for me considering that very early on in the game, in a flashback, I saw that the protagonist drinks absinthe. So all of the wonder and mystery about this world was *gone* when i realised 'oh, this guy is a drunk who is out of his mind laying in a ditch somewhere' because he drinks bloody absinthe. None of it is real. It's like finding out at the end of the game that the character was *dreaming* except i found out he's a hallucinating drunkard within the first quarter hour of the game.",

You make choices that have no bearing on anything. Gun upgrades are practically useless as ammo depletion necessitates using underpowered ones you haven't upgraded yet. Elizabeth has no actual presence during gameplay. Lockpicking and finding secrets are obnoxiously easy, even on the touted '90s mode' you'll end up with more lockpicks than there are even doors to unlock. Vigors are mostly crowd control powers that stun outside of 3. The writting is pretty abysmal, mostly consisting of mentioning the Columbia citizens are racist but not doing anything with it, the rest involves a complete botching of how alternate dimensions make sense.  Or if you want a more personal take. I thoroughly regret paying money for this game and wish I had it back.",

            "review_text": "[If you are wondering about the stats, I completed the game on my alt account, and bought it on this one for the DLCs since the discount was so good]  Gonna have to say no to this one.  Here's what you gotta understand about Bioshock: it's a story-based game with a very specific lore. Lore requires a sort of 'scientific magic' to be present to give the atmosphere it's unique charm and it is also used for gameplay. That's just it: it's used in  atmosphere  and  gameplay . Is does  not  work as a centerpiece of the storyline. Story in Bioshock games has always been about morality. It's been about 'How much is 'too much'?'. Infinite takes a turn in a different direction of pseudo-scientific plot twists (hence the name), in it's attempt to surprise the player, and unfortuntaley fails at is big time.  The story in infinite revolves around the a splified and twsited version of the alternate dimensions theory(ies), and without spoiling anything for you I can say one thing: the big plot twist of the game is basically this:  'LOL all this ♥♥♥♥ you did doesn't matter because the variable x in world 0x62756c6c736869742331 has crossed variable y at location (6,6,6) since rabbit stepped on his carrot that turned out to be a big daddy and eat the coordinate at a dinner party with ID 0x637261636b. I know this all ♥♥♥♥ is confusing and nonsensical, but you, the player, just need to understand that all you did was a giant waste of time. Plot twist! Ovations please!'  The Mass Effect 3 syndrome™ is present in full with this game, where writers tried too hard to surprise and 'mystify' the player and this Elizabeth character and ended up going way over their heads.  The game is also quite linear. Where I was hoping for hubs to explore, side-quests to take, people to help/hinder and affect the outcome of the main story with that, I found chocies that are only forced and meaningless (no effect on the story), no hubs, no side-quests and wholly linear level design and story (which makes sense for the latter since all you do is a waste of time so what's the point in making different variations and giving you chocies?).   The world of the game is great and certainly up to par and Elizabeth is also well-integrated into gameplay in a way that doesn't frustrate you, but also gives her an important role. But due to linearity and lack of interaction (the aforementioned lack of hubs and exploration), getting better aquanted withe the world is not really an option and the bits where you can observe the lore, are mostly set gallery pieces, with very limited interaction, the only exception being the beginning of the game at the festival, that lets you participate in activities (but not properly talk to people and no side-quests obviously).  While having it's moments, Infinite is most certainly a big let down for me due to contrived and over-complicated storyline and linearity. I can only recommend it at a good discount (60% and less) and certainly not full price.",

Weapon hoarding is dropped in favor of the CoD-style swapping system, giving you much less attachment to your guns while also making feel much less unique overall. Enemies are mostly humans and encounters are solely restricted to the big, cover-littered arenas the game pushes you along to, secluding combat from the finely constructed (albeit linear) game world. One major point people mark in this game's favor is its story, but that's not much to brag about either. It's 'mature' but that doesn't make it outstanding, just a step above the average video game plot. Of course there's a plot twist that throws you off, but since everyone who played the game knew to expect it, its impact wasn't anywhere near the effect of the twist from the first BioShock.  I'd give this game a rent at least. If you liked it, that's great, but for me it was more of a one-time playthrough.

            "review_text": "I know I'm a day late and a buck short on this game, but holy ♥♥♥♥ have I been missing out. But at least I waited to play the PC version. Anyway on with the review. Bioshock: Infinite is the third in the series, but takes place in 1912 instead of the 60's and the 70's. You play as Booker DeWitt, a broken man who has to go to the city of Coloumbia to get a girl to wipe away the gambleing debts. Let's talk about Coloumbia, because it's a much better setting then Rapture to me. First: It's floating, so that makes it cooler then a leaky underwater city. Second: It has more color in it, which is always a good thing, and it looks butiful. If you have at least a mid-range PC this game will look good, hell I'd recomend that you turn in to low then turn it to ultra (if you can handle it) because the coding even says low in equvilent to the consoles. Just incase you're wondering, I palyed it on a GTX 760, and it ran fine at ultra, but enough about graphics. On your journy through the city you'll have one of the gretest supporting and female charicter at your side: Elizibeth. Now you may be worried about her being an Esscort mission like Ashly from Resident Evil 4, but fear not! The game actually tells you flat out, don't worry about her, she can take care of herself. Actually I hated the parts where she wasn't there, she helps out in combat too. Every so often an icon will apear telling you that Elizibeth found something usful and she'll give it to you; stuff like Ammo, Salts, and Health, so all in all Elizibeth is a wonderful charicter. While we're talking about gameplay, let's dive deeper into it. You have your standard Plasmid (now called Vigors) and gun setup, but now instead of a dedicated melee weapon like the drill or wrench, you have hook. This hook is not only used to pull off badass finish moves on enemys, but you can use it to move around fast and strike people from the skylines for maximum damage. This time there around as many 'there's water shoot bolts of electricy at it to fry enemys' moments, but you have something that's better. Elizibeth can open 'tears' . These are portals to a different world, and they can spawn things like guns, turrets, and hook for you well...hook. The catch is, you can only open one at a time, and this spices up combat in fun ways to keep from making it dull. If I had to complain about the combat, it's you can only hold 2 guns at a time. This forces into holding 2 guns you really like instead of exspirmenting. I just ran with the burst rifle and RPG as much as possible. The rest of the game is solid, Booker is a really interesting charicter, and he's voiced by Troy Baker who is also Joel from The Last of Us and does a wonderful job. There are also two mysterious charicters that add dry humor to the game. The biggest problem I have with not only this game, but the whole Bioshock series in genral is how much ♥♥♥♥ing sidetracking there is. Can we go to point A? No we have to track down two tears and battle the same boss three times to do that! It's not as bad as the first one, but it's still glearing. The city being built in the air ads a lot of cool set pices like fighing on a huge zepplin. You may have noticed I haven't talked much about the story, because I would be sinning if I spoil anything, so just play it for yourself and have fun! 10/10",

I have not done Burial At Sea for this is the original game release only.  After playing through the game I have good and bad things to say so I'll put them in the pros and cons sections then go into a bit of detail.  Pros -  Responsive controls (KB + M) Pleasuring graphics Great sound (game + voices) Pacing Satifying gameplay Various ways to go about combat Narrative Balance  Cons -  Value to play time Difficulty Supplies dump (Elizabeth giving) DLC (not counting BAS 1 + 2)  In-depth starting with Pros  Responsive controls - The game had excellent controls and mouse functionally, I turned Mouse Acceleration off but other than that the game had excellent responsive controls with no akward controls except maybe the 'Show Objective' button was set to N by default so it was kind of akward to pull my hand over but otherwise great.  Pleasuring graphics - I ran the graphics at High, Medium and Low and even at the Medium quality the game still looked great, the color pallatte and bright colors switched nicely with the darker tone near the end of the game. Never felt like a random jump.  Great sound - Audio was amazing, the songs fit the time period and theme of Columbia and always fit the situation. Troy Baker does an amazing job once again as Booker DeWitt making a interesting and believable character. Elizabeth was a great addition and added interesting dialogue based on my actions. If I did something in the game world she would respond with things like 'Oh my god!' for decapitating a man with a tool.  Pacing - The game was paced well and never went too fast or too slow. Making it to Elizabeth on Monument Island felt like an achievement for the hard work to get there. It had a nice amount of exploration, Hordes of enemies and story telling with no fighting.  Satifying gameplay - Gameplay was fun and interesting, It was simple to take out a horde of enemies cause there was always a secret to them that was easy enough to figure out. all the guns were fun to try out but for most of the game I stuck to the Shotgun and Sniper Rifle. I was able to go on the skyhook, air strike someone then take down a patriot without breaking motion. Vigors (Plasmids) were interesting and fun to use while mantaining practicality.  Various ways to go about combat - You never had to stick to one style of combat. you could sneak, go on the hooks or use vigors. you're never required to use Vigors except in certain situations.  Narrative - Story was simple at a glance but had a deeper meaning with the audio logs filling in backstory with historical connections. Characters kept it going and never got bored or un-interested in the story.  Balance - Combat was fun with each item having its own use, I never felt cheated by an enemy cause I always knew it was my fault for dying. Tougher enemies were challenging but I never had to kill them in a specific way.  Value to play time - Being a linear game it does finish in about 8 - 10 hours. I clocked in 11 hours with some exploring, but not combing every area of items or audio logs. It's probably a game I'll play once or twice every couple of months but It's more worth it as a rental. If you wanna buy it I'd say $15 - 20 would do it justice. It's like LA Noire in it's not worth $60. Pick it up on sale and give it a try.  Difficulty - The game was rather easy, I ran out of ammo a few times and died about 5. I never had to use melee only cause Elizabeth would always throw me more Salts (EVE) and ammo. I turned the difficulty up to Hard near the end and even with that there was very little punishment for failing. 1999 mode is better if you want a real challenge.  Supplies Dump - Should go with Difficulty, Elizabeth gave me health, salts, ammo and money when I needed it. but not too often, once I got her I barely had to grab things myself. see Difficulty.  DLC - DLC is dumb, Burial At Sea Episode 1 + 2 are worth it but the others are cash grabs. Buy the Season Pass ONLY for Burial At Sea, like the game get it on sale.  Verdict -  Overall I found the game very fun and enticing. Gameplay, Sound and Story all tied in well and made a great way to spend my Friday. It's a good game but don't think it deserves the perfect scores it got. It's a good game to play if you like the Bioshock series and was worth the $7.50 I got it for. It has problems like it being too easy most of the time and not having much replay value besides doing all the choices you didn't do. Give it a try if you're thinking about it, you won't be disappointed.  8.5/10  Pretty ♥♥♥♥in' good.",

The tear mechanic allows for a intresting take on combat, allowing you to spawn in helpful items. 3. A side character that isn't something that you don't need to constantly worry about, unlike (some) other games. 4. Different enviorments that connect well together.  The Bad:  1. Almost half of the guns are a near copy of some others, but with noticeable differences. 2. picking locks that are not story related will have you looking around for lockpicks at times. 3. Story that is good, but can be diffcult to understand at times. 4. can be confusing, at times, where you are supposed to go.   Verdict: Bioshock Infinite is a great game, in my opinion, but it still has some flaws. Even with those flaws, I still found it to be a enjoyable exeprience.  Rating: 8.9/10",

            "review_text": "Bioshock Infinite is the opposite of the first two games. As opposed to being dark, grim and creepy, Bioshock infinite is bright vibrant and action packed with some dark undertones. The game is shrowded with subtle foreshadowing as you are thrust into a new world with a seemingly cheerful setting, that is until you realize the way it's society works which is when the meat of the game begins. The visuals are easily one of the games strong points, it takes a 1940's setting and throws it into the sky. The world of Bioshock infinite is a work of art, there are many intricate details in it's design and it's fun just to explore... the first few minutes. Afterwards the game becomes a linear storydriven game which is a shame, i'd love to see an open world game with this concept but then again, this is Bioshock after all, Bioshock has always been a linear title but inlike the first two, Bioshock Infinite made me want to backtrack between areas to take in the scenary more but sadly the game doesn't let you do that after certain points. Early on in the game, there are a few open sections but later on, the linearity kicks in. This is where the game became less about the visuals and more about the action.  The story is a little convoluted but it's there. It gets a little crazy later on and the game kinda changes it's pace half way through. This is after a particular event in the story which is not necesarrily a major event but it does change the pacing of the game considerably. Afterwards the game feels like an adreniline rush all the way up to the end.  Gameplay wise, Bioshock Infinite takes it's RPG elements a tad lighter. Unlike the previous game, weapons and ammo are a lot easier to come by and plasmids are replaced with vigors which can be found throughout the game an upgraded at vending machines. I didn't mind the gameplay, it wasn't groundbreaking but it was good enough to be enjoyable. The two weapon limit kinda got annoying but it's not really a big deal in the long run since you'll find the weapons you like and stick with them.  All in all i reccommend this game as it's definitely worth your time.",

The combat is extremely boring/repetitive, and the battles feel so artificial and staged; it really removes you from the game. The game is way too easy (on hard difficulty), until you get to one particular battle towards the end where you will die a bunch until you figure out how to corner yourself where you're not vulnerable (terrible game design). The rails aspect seemed like it would be fun, but I found myself rarely using it. Not a lot of depth in terms of the vigors and combining, although this was probably the most fun aspect of the game. They changed the weapon system to only give you two at a time, which is fine. However, because you pay to upgrade particular weapons, you either use those weapons you paid to upgrade the whole time, or spread your invest in upgrades because you'll get bored (or run out of ammo, though this didn't happen much) and keep switching weapons anyway. It definitely seems like all the effort went into leading you through a particular experience. The game is set up to just basically lead you through a scripted story. Fine...  So was the oversimplied combat redeemed by the story? No... This was one of the most convoluted plots of anything I have ever seen or played. Why did it have to go down the philosophical rabbit hole? Silly me, expecting them not to abandon what made the previous games great. This game story-wise was so close to being great. I guess it's just me (from seeing these positive comments) but I like when my actions in the game matter and amount to something. Especially in a game like this where you get emotionally involved in the characters. But the ending ruined this completely. It was very clear (especially from the clip after the credits) that your actions mean nothing. Why have a game with (minimal) choices at all? A game is not the right medium for this story at all.  Don't get me wrong, I applaud game developers and writers for trying something new. But the end was just as bad as a Deux Ex Machina, but for the game series I loved. Anyone who says this is a good 'game' hasn't played a good game before. You might as well just watch a movie like Looper or 12 Monkeys and save yourself about 8 hours.",

            "review_text": "Columbia makes an astonishing first impression, as the floating city setting of Irrational's Bioshock Infinite, built off the wonder and exceptionalism of 1912 America. Everything seemed possible thanks to industrialization. Almost immediately things sour, as the player is confronted with a deconstructed look at Columbia's hidden underclass, and astonishing racism. Citizens of Columbia pay tribute to their leader, Zachary Comstock, a religious fanatic who believes himself to be a prophet. These prophecies set the game into motion, as Private ♥♥♥♥ Booker Dewitt is drawn to Columbia in search of a girl. He is singled out from a crowd, launching Booker into self-defense that will carry him through extreme violence. The first hour can be spent enjoying the sights and sounds of a place that could not exist. One sequence takes the player through a carnival with playable games, others include a boardwalk with merry-go-round, and a beautiful beach. By contrast, another level is a horrifying museum. The art style is bright and energetic with bold character designs. Irrational's world-building is perfect, including compelling in-game ads, soundscape, and placing a player in the historical moment.The story is anything but light, taking classicism head on, as well as themes of violence and quantum destiny. Conversations help fill in the backstory as do voxophone and kinetescopes. Booker's first weapon is the skyhook, a gruesome melee weapon. Once you meet Elizabeth, a powerful and highly intelligent, yet innocent woman, she reacts to the player's violent actions. Elizabeth is integral, taking care of herself as well as throwing useful items to Booker. She has the latent ability to open and manipulate tears in space and time to pull in objects from other dimensions. Booker is equipped with turn of the century gun archetypes (revolver, shotgun, etc.) and Vigors, the Columbia version of Plasmids. Gear is also invaluable: it can have offensive and defensive attributes. Vigors include a fire grenade, crow attacks, the bucking bronco, and others, that can all be combined in amusing and creative ways pertaining to the elements and physics.&nbsp;The effect of Vigors on enemies can often be realistic and graphically violent. Prepare for head pops and bloody skeletons galore. Weapon upgrades can be readily purchased this time around. Much of the hacking type gameplay has been turned into button presses, with the possession vigor used to take over turrets and automatons.&nbsp; Automatons modeled after Presidents are the largest threat to Booker, rivaled only by the Big Daddyesque Handyman, a lumbering behemoth of a mechanical man. Truthfully none of these opponents is too challenging one-on-one. It is only due to some excellent enemy scripting that combat comes alive.&nbsp; On the hard difficulty groups teams engage in realistic fashions, rushing the player and forcing precise on the moment decision making. Skyrail combat introduces a whole new element to combat, and feels like a gameplay breath of fresh air. Irrational has crafted vertical arenas in which players can leap amongst opponents, transitioning to upper or lower levels. Bioshock blows the roof off standard shooter design. Inifinte is perfectly paced, and extremely compelling, better experienced than told, with astonishing developments and interesting characters. At its heart it is a love story, with Booker and Elizabeth linked and compelling protagonists. Side characters like the Lutece twins add shading to the narrative. Bioshock Infinite could never be the game Bioshock was. But like that title, it is a beautiful and moving game about legacies, fathers and daughters, idealized authoritarian societies fallen into chaos, and many thoughtful, well-considered gameplay elements. As class warfare begins to rip Columbia apart, the player can feel certain that this is due both to Booker's action and his inaction. It is a fine title, and although it clearly positions itself for a sequel, could series director Ken Levine truly have places to take Bioshock, beyond Infinite?",

But this flaw isn’t that bad compared to the rest (though it is annoying).  Play this game only if you care about graphics and graphical presentation, it’s not a BAD game per se, just a mediocre game which can give you somewhat awesome pleasure playing it for the first hours due to the graphics and voice acting, but soon enough the gameplay becomes repetitive and boring (throughout Normal mode there was actually only ONE fight near the end that enabled me to get serious cause it was hard and could give you several game overs, and the rest was mostly boring), and you get curious about the story and what’s actually going on, and well… the story only progresses at the beginning and then picks up at about 80% through the game, and then the ending doesn’t give any satisfaction whatsoever.

There are two choices in the game, neither of which make any difference to the plot. You know your character is a cold-blooded killer because it keeps telling you every few minutes. You meet the girl, she runs away, you catch her, she runs away, blah blah blah. You search for a gunsmith, go up the stairs, go down the stairs, enter a portal, go back up the stairs, back down the stairs, up and down and back and forth, wicky wicky wicky, stop the delikabate misberate. Did we mention racism was bad? Near the end everything goes strange. You go forward in time, you go back in time. Everyone keeps talking about choices, but you don't get any. All the plot and explanations are crammed into the last ten minutes, which may as well be one cut scene. The summary is (spoiler alert): you are the good guy, who turned bad, and also the bad guy, who just got worse. You kill the bad guy, then go back in time and kill the good guy (yourself) before he ever became bad or worse, thus the entire 8-12 hours of gameplay never actually happened. How satisfying.

Much of Bioshock 1 and 2 can be found here, from the looting system, to plasmids to dystopian story. For some that may be great, for others its tiring and rehashed. If you have played Bioshock 1 and 2, and are a fan of its combat system and dystopian society storyline you should get it. If you want fast paced sharp combat and aren't much interested in getting immersed in a story I would look elsewhere.   On a sidenote, the save system is an attrocity. There is no way to manually save, neither quick save nor menu save. The checkpoints are often times spread out, forcing you to keep playing or lose sometimes 20 minutes worth of progress. Put a huge damper on my fun, as I absolutely loath checkpoint systems like this. Nowadays it should not be a problem to add such a functionality, but I suspect it might be related to consoles. The good thing is, there is a fov slider, and they seem to have put a modicum of effort into the PC version. (2013)",

The ending is like a convoluted version of the Donnie Darko plot, except everything is spelled out five times. There are a few really decent segments, but for the most part, the game requires you not to think about the story and just go ahead and shoot the things that are in your way. The world also lacks life from the first hour or so on.  The reason I don't recommend this is that both of the first two Bioshock games are superior - you got a feeling for the place you were in, you could follow the plot at every point and there were no unfair enemies with Mega Man-like boss weaknesses (try using the Raven power against Handymen and you'll see what I mean).",

But the story? Holy hell is it good. And the game looks good as a newborn baby. The reason why I'm not recommending it is simple; if you know from somewhere how it ends, there's no point in playing it, it has nothing revolutionary other than its story, so unless you buy it from a sale at a reasonable price, (10€/$/£ or less) there is no reason to buy it.  The main aspect of a shooter is to have fun with guns and the games' unique combat mechanics. But when the shooter has guns that are ♥♥♥♥ poor in damage, no real challenge and bullet spongy enemies, there is nothing left to redeem it. Vigors? A poor mans Plasmid. There is no reason why Columbia, a flying city, would have supernatural drinks just for Booker, since the citizens are too full of 'The Prophet' to use them themselves. I went straight for Hard since the previous Bioshocks were not hard either, hoping for a change in Infinite. Boy was i wrong, running out of ammo because a single enemy takes about a clip? Super hard indeed. Good thing I have an portable dispenser called Elizabeth with me who just happens to have the salts I need, or the ammo I desperately need. The last 30mins of the game consists of the game shoving down its story down your throat and you get to know about everything in the last minutes, which is super fun and subtle. Weapon upgrades are boring and there is no more hacking like in previous Bioshocks, Elizabeth just needs a handful of lockpicks to crack a safe or a door, and you just snap your fingers to get a person/robot on your side for a while. I also ran into 2 gamebreaking bugs which made me lose a total of about 20~ mins of my time because a 'must have' Vigor fell through the ground and an enemy just dissapeared and made it impossible to continue without resetting and killing everyone twice. The game is not perfect, it's not an 10/10, but it is a pretty strong 8/10. It's pretty overpraised to be honest. The sidequests consist of finding keys and looking for codes and that's it, don't expect a lot of freedom outside of the small transit areas with infinitely spawning enemies. (puns ahoy) If you can, borrow the game, or, if you've seen the ending, just pass it up, there's no point in wasting 8H grinding through enemies just to see yourself going: 'Huh, well that was sudden and- OH WAIT WHAT' *credits roll*",

The skylines were one of the best parts of the game, allowing really fun manouvering around the arenas you are placed in, but the abilities the players have are not very fun to use, making the combat boring when the skylines are not present. Tonics feel misplaced in this game. I feel like the only reason they had them was because the game was a Bioshock game. In Bioshock 1 the tonics are there to exemplify what happens when science can advance without the moral boundaries we have in our civilization. But in Infite they are simply there. Only some special enemies use Tonics to fight you. No one in the general populace is shown to use Tonics.  And the moments that stand out the most is in the start of the game and the end. At the beginning there are posters showing a mark on hand, indicating that the person with that mark is to be arrested or killed on sight. The playable character has that mark on his hand. What does he do? Nothing, just blatantly waltz around with the mark plain in sight. This was so incredibly stupid it left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the game.

Elizabeth whilst a good companion is nothing but annoying, she will attempt to toss you supplies when you are in combat putting you in a high risk situation because you lose control after pressing the acceptance key, if you attempt to move to cover you will more often than not lose the ability to regain supplies from her. I also feel Elizabeth is stupid somewhat in her moral and sensibility choices. The graphics while amazing left me feeling sick after an hour or two of play, even with FOV at 110 I still felt the overpowering colors leaving me dizzy after a while.  Gameplay – 8 Visuals – 9 Replay – 0 Story – 8  Not as great a game as everyone makes out, fewer powers than bioshock 1, a harder story to follow and believe than any in the series.

I didn't really enjoy bioshock 2, for me it was just a cheap cash-in on already established formula, but still that game improved on some combat mechanics without dumbing it down terribly. And then ladies and gentelmen Bioshock infinite comes up, it is a total letdown gameplaywise, it's no more a thinking man's game, there're no more usefull hacks, passives became extremelly situational, plasmids (vigors) became less fun. they aren't simply as diverse as they were in first game. you will probably end up spamming one or two. Now gunplay,Bioshock 1 had bad gunplay, let's face it, but at least you can carry a lot of weapons at a time, here not that gunplay is improved, apparently booker can't carry more than 2 weapons, it is a shame, and really insulting to game's roots. there are also no puzzles. Story and Atmosphere superb in both games. But i still prefer Bioshock 1's story about betrail, and that amazing plot twist. (ending sucked tho), Here we get more complete ending, which essentially is infodumping last 20 minutes of the game, and it works, don't get me wrong, but i think it just could have been done in a better way. Atmospherewise Infinite is very scripted, i mean elizabeth will dance there till the end of the times, if you don't pull her off. Enemies, i think it's a tie here, i think Handyman was alright, boys of silence were pretty scary, but that siren boss was recycled 3 times, 3 ♥♥♥♥in times, it's just lazy. Nothing will ever compare to big daddy for me. So i can say if you have played first game, liked it, and want some 'more of the same' go and get bioshock 2.  Otherwise Bioshock infintie is a great game, it's just not the game i was expecting from maker of one of best games ever made, it's good but totally different. Play it for the story and for the atmosphere. Don't expect a masterpiece like the first one was tho. 7.5/10",

The game has no manual save; it just uses 'checkpoints' and a resurrection system where you lose stuff. Which is very annoying unless you're so good you never lose, or into frustration and tedium. It has its supporters but there's nothign FORCING you to use a manual save if it's there, and there could be a trophy for completion entirely using checkpoints, if you're in to that sort of thing.  Also, you can only carry two weapons at a time. More realistic perhaps, although some of the heavier ones probably weigh more than two light ones, and you have a completely separate ammo budget for each one. And if you're going for a bit of realism, you'd have to lose the skylines with their seventy-foot leaps and drops altogether.  The plot roars along for a while, but at the end it deteriorates rapidly into a mystic muddle rather like a certain Mass Effect game I might mention, utterly unlike the exemplary plotting of Bioshock one and two.  So I would say the game is diverting, but not worth it at this price. If you are going to play it, probably worth reading a strategy guide along with it.",

While the previous games had you build your own private arsenal of weaponry with all kinds of different ammo types, this game allows you two guns at a time with a single type of ammo for each weapon. The previous games in this series allowed you to administer your own life and energy replinishment items, this is now handled for you automaticallly on pick up or tosseed to you by an AI. Most offensive of all though is the addition of an overshield and regenerating health. These modern conventions took an extreme toll on the core gameplay and as a result his game essentially became Modern Warfare steampunk edition. Additionally, the powers here are mostly retreads of the powers from the previous games and the underutilized skyhook mechanic is a disappointment as well.

The only way to know where to go is to press a button(which is un-conveniantly the N key) which in turn creates an arrow on the ground which you have to look straight down to see and points you in the genral direction of where you need to go.

Not as in many hours, but that I played it half way and then stopped, and didn't have a ton of motiviation to come back to finish it for like a year. Don't get me wrong the overall story is really really good, but it didn't get me hooked enough all the way through the middle, I only came back because several friends told me the ending is really really worth it. And that is pretty much the same thing I would tell you.  So I think the world they've built in Bioshock Infinite is absolutely fantastic. The architecture, people, and whole atmosphere just felt perfect for what they are trying to portray. The art direction in this game is just phenominal. Elizabeth is a wonderful character and every appearance of the Lutece twins were entertaining.  Adam Sessler does a great review of this aspect of the game on youtube using much better words than I can come up with.   My main issue with the game is the combat, the controls are a bit clunky and extended combat felt repetetive. The combat is fun in small doses and there are certain battles in the game that are memorable but overall they felt like hinderances to the next part of the story. Playing around with the different vigor power is fun for the first couple times but you eventually find a combination of power and guns you like. Part of it is that switching between more than 2 vigor powers wasn't very fluid control wise and you can only carry two types of guns. If you ran out of ammo you just improvised on whatever you could pick up. Usually the most effective weapon for an area is available through a tear anyway. If things got overwhelmed you just run around and take cover until Elizabeth offered you full heals, mana, and ammo. Overall the longer battles felt tedious rather than difficult, and I didn't want to switch up the difficulty because I already wanted to get to the next part of the story as fast as I can. Many of the fighting parts of the game also felt jarring to the rest of the story.  But I do have to say, the ending was quite good. And looking back there were a fair number of hints sprinkled throughout the game that supports it. I think the game does great job at creating a sophisticated, immersive world and a intriguing story to discover, interrupted by these less enjoyable combat areas that didn't feel like they quite fit with the narrative trying to be told.",

You approach a society where racism is more strong than today, it is noticable in the beginning by several posters hanging on the walls, but other than that, everything seems so perfect. The racism part becomes more clear further into the game.   It goes from this Idyllic phase into a dark and more deeper phase.

And subsequently forgot Bioshock, consigning it to the back of the list of games. I saw Bioshock Infinite come out and was quite impressed with the graphics and storyline, but never considered adding it to my (growing!) list of games. I eventually go the game on a Steam sale...wow!  Story-wise, it's very rich...expands a lot on the whole idea behind Bioshock. I've enjoyed playing this a lot. Graphics-wise, these are simply amazing! It's easy to run this game with a lot of detail and not put any strain on your system (provided you meet or exceed them).  I've still got a long way to go, but with leave coming up, I've got the chance to finish the game, and then move onto Bioshock 1 &amp; 2 to complete the series...looking forward to it!",

            "review_text": "This game plays and feels like a proper FPS...Almost. Some of the control designs could have been improved, but it's not like the controls were downright aweful. So, lets take a look at them. Alright, so we start of with your average controls, wasd to move, shift to spint, ctrl, or c, to crouch, space to jump, f to pick up...Alright, not unheard of, but not usually used, e to switch guns....Ok, that's new, still not complaining. Q to switch vigors, which is also alright. RMB to cast a vigor and Z to aim. What? Look, you should have mapped the vigor swapping to the number buttons only, and had Q to switch guns, E to pick up/interact, F to mele, and V to cast vigors. However, despite this major flaw in control mapping, the game was still fun. You could even hit things while hip-firing, which makes up for the odd Z to aim thing.  So, lets move on to the story. I ♥♥♥♥ing loved it....until I hit the ending. I seriosuly think they got M. Night Shyamalan to write it because they were running out of steam, and the game suffered for it. {{{{{WARNING THERE ARE SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT}}}}} So, we start off shrouded in mystery as to where we're going, why we're going there, and who is sending us there. There's no real tutorial, but since the controls are fairly intuitive, you're going to be alright. The game also makes up for a lack of a proper tutorial with giving you little hints throughout the game, which I always find helpful. They also were helpful hints, not those cryptic hints a devloper gives you like 'There seems to be a crack.' or 'Try not to die!' Seriosuly, if you're a devloper that gives useless hints, stop making hints, or stop making games. So we move on to some small amount of character and plot devlopment as we climb the lighthouse. However, when we reach the top, we're presented with a fairly easy puzzle. Once we solve it...Well, now the fun begins! BASHOOOOM! Up and up, higher and higher until....SHIZAM! An entire floating city! A bit religious, which I would have considered alright if it wasn't a massive rip on christianity. (NOTE: I do NOT follow any religion, nor will I ever follow one. However, I don't think it's OK to build a game that jabs a religion as a main element of the plot. We're all free to believe what we want, and so long as we don't try and force others to accept our view as the right view, you're fine. Seriously, don't be a Comstock.) Now that you're in the city blahblahblah, plot devlopment, and then SHAZOOM! You're killing a guy with a fancy new toy that you'll come to love for the rest of the game. Then you get a gun and it's all downhill, or uphill, from there. You're never going to leave this flying city, ever, so get used to it. Sure, you're gonna try, but you're gonna fail. So get used to it. So, as we move on, Booker fights his way to the tower where he liberates its captive, Emily, and then fights his way to an airship where he attmepts to set course for NY and fails due to getting knocked the F**K out by Emily who is livid about being duped. Blahblahbalah, more plot stuff, fighting through a city, VOX, yahddah yahddah. Then you start to learn about how Emily can travle through dimensions and proceed to do so to get your airship back. It's pretty much one incredibly long cresendo of story climaxes with little to no falling action. The ending, of course, follows this and presents you with so many twists you're left confused on what just happened. Basically, let me break down the ending for you. SO. After having fought through so much crap you literally feel unstoppable, that brid-thing just tears you a new one and leaves you thinking 'Oh I did not just fight through hell and hellfire to be stopped by the damn liniar story!' SURPRISE MOTHERF**KER! You just did. So the bird takes Emily back to Comstock and for six months they work on her, which is confusing to the player because you've only been gone for about FIVE HOURS. TOPS. You get to see NY burning, but you're sent back in time to stop it from happening, and so you free Emily, and go to find Comstock. Now, you fight your way through hell and hellfire again to get to Comstock, in which you see he's putting on a show of being a loving father to Emily, which is then dropped as he goes mad and tells Booker to tell Emily what happened to her finger. Are you confused yet? Yeah, there is nothing that really abates this emotion. At all. Ok, so you go over and remove Comstock from Emily thinking 'Alright, yeah! I'll keep him at bay and make sur-...Oh...' And then proceed to watch Booker kill Comstock with no remorse, even while Emily is yelling for him to stop. I'm sorry, what? This is a pivital point of the story and we don't even get to show the ♥♥♥♥er mercy? Just kill a defenseless old man by drowning him? By the way, drowing, Booker has a lot of experience with it. It's known as foreshadowing. So yeah, you kill a practically defenseless old man and then move on to take control of the zeplin. Afterwards, you get attacked by the VOX again, and then you summon the songbird to help you fight them. Alright, yeah. That's actually pretty neat. So, you fight through hell and hellfire to get to the tower Emily was held at and then you order the songbird to destroy it, ♥♥♥♥ happens, and then Emily takes you to the door dimension which leads to all sorts of different places. You explore Booker's history and end up finding out that Booker is Comstock and that Emily is his daughter and then after all that, your own daughter drowns you. I saw the ending coming from a mile away. The moment we entered the door world, I was like 'Welp, Booker's gonna drown. Permantly this time.' I'm sorry, but the ending put me off of all the DLC. I seriosuly just didn't want to touch that ♥♥♥♥ because I felt that there was no point after being M. Night Shyamalaned. Seriously, can we get a disclaimer on ALL videogames with a massive plot twist from this point on that says 'There is a massive plot-twist at the end that will leave you very confused.' Because twists make me question just why I did all that fighting if death was the only outcome. Ruins the ENTIRE game experience, which was awesome, all in one fell swoop.",

I didn't mind the racism, for anyone pointing it out. If you are not a fan of racism, this game will be fantastic for you.  ..Why?

It was an incredibly dull game. I'm wondering whether that's just part of the console experience after playing Bioshock Infinite on the PC.   It's not a challenging game. It stilll has the repetative elements of Bioshock 1, but just less off them. The levels are well designed for combat, with interesting use of interactive fixtures through tears and rails. The enemy AI is dull, and you won't find them circling around you or making good use of cover. They seem to move along set paths, repeatedly, as in A&gt;B&gt;A&gt;B and will stay in the same spots. So if you fall back for cover or to lure them into a trap, they won't follow.   In contrast to the dull grunts who make up most of your cannon fodder, slightly larger enemies like fireman and handymen deliver a very large amount of damage while soaking up bullets. They're also very mobile, have long range weapons that can pin you down, and will generally be the biggest challanges you'll face.   The story suffers quite a bit. Like in Bioshock 1, when you first start the whole scenario of why you're there just doesn't make sense. I suppose this is to prompt you to explore and enjoy discovering parts of the backstory. Things become more apparant the further you go, but this makes me start out the game with little motivation. I found the ending boring and pointless. I was very disappointed.    Overall, it's a fun, quick game to play when you just want to loose a few bullets to let off steam and relax. It's completely undemanding on normal difficulty, and something you can zone out while playing.",

The sky hook was very fun to use too. from this point I will also add, there is a, what was the gene tonic in the first game, where yopu can attach the hook to something andb e invulnerable for a while, this was, without a doubt the single best 'gene tonic' in the entire game, and even then, it still is rendered useless by the games unrelenting difficulty on the Hard and 1999 Modes, the last battle is also stupidly difficult. as someone who considers the first installment of this series on of his favourite games of all time, I can say that I found this game to be very disappointing, not only for the cut and paste plot, but also, I think Columbia, despite it's graphical beauty, it lackls the depth and the fascination you had with Rapture in the original game, in the first game you knew you were going underwater, and knew you were essentially going to hell, here it loses that almost shock value of when you hear Atlas and Johnny talkign over the radio or the recording of Andrew Ryan explaining the original vision for Rapture.I also found the character of Elizabeth incredibly boring, I was personally more interested in Booker, what in elizabeth have we not seen before? yeah the occassional ammo or health or (cringe) salts drop is handy, but overall, I just don't see what's so great about her, Booker was really the high point of this game character wise, plot wise, you've already read how it is a basic copy and paste of Bioshock 2 only set in the sky and more raciall charged, but what I did like was the time travel involved, and the obvious breaks in time like the Barbershop Quartet singing the Beach Boys song God Only Knows. On a whole, this game is enjoyable, but, I'd say to save yourself the disappointment I faced, go in with as low expectations as possible, I know Irrational Games are no longer a company, so, whereever it goes next in 2K, I hope they return to Rapture, a side note, I found the changes of Adam and Eveand Plasmids to 'Salts and Vigors' incredibly (excuse the term) Cringey, yeah change them, but when the names are so terrible, urgh.

A cool story that will leave you feeling a little sad at it's conclusion but also then bring a smile to your face, after the credits, that will make you want to play through again. While the characters that you meet in the game are quite well done, I found that the music was quite awesome. I am not a religious person but I did like that small break in the game where Booker and Elizabeth break into a very cool song.  The thing that I didn't like about the game was the final battle, that seemed to video gamey for such a mature story. And yes the story is what drives you forward, all the ambiguosness makes your want to find what the hell those two are talking about ( He doesn't row!) makes sense later. Some will say that the gunplay doesn't feel right or that the gameplay might be too easy, I may agree if I didn't just stick to he carbine and machine gun. Some will say that the lack of innovative weapons is a 'deal breaker', not eveything has to be re-invented. I found that the weapons were just fine for killing everything I seen. The powers that you get are quite interesting and I never really used them as I prefered to get headshots and hold my ground near a corner, my style of playing really didn't warrant all the powers and skyhooks. I shoot and move, repeat. I still enjoyed it though and will play again using the powers and that crazy ♥♥♥ skyhook. Graphics are quite good and the sounds are also good, the music is what I enjoyed. Cyndi Lauper's 'Girls just want to have fun' was a treat, same with that Tears for Fears song 'Everybody wants to rule the world' So if you want a engaging game that will leave you with a tear in your eye at the conclusion then so play this game as it's definately one of the best written games in the last few years that really challenge your preceptions on what makes for a great game.",

            "review_text": "Bioshock Infinite Review  (Story) There's always a chance to make things right. Bioshock Infinite is set in the early 20th century, just before World War I. Rather than a city under the sea, the game takes place in Colombia, a city the floats in the sky. You play as Booker, a Pinkerton agent who finds himself in debt to his superiors. He is given a chance at redemption and sent to Colombia where he must rescue Elizabeth, a girl born with special abilities and subsequently idolized there. Naturally, people do not take kindly to Booker's presence and thus the main conflict is created. As the story unfolds, you discover the origins of the city, learn about people who inhabit it, and discover it's wonders. The plot can be a bit confusing at times so it's important to pay attention. I had to play through the game three times before I understood everything, or at least believed I understood everything.  (Gameplay) Again, Bioshock presents itself as a first person shooter. This time around however, long range combat is just as relevant as close quarters combat. You can only carry two weapons at a time. Weapons can still be upgraded, but the upgrade no longer changes the appearance of the gun. There are only eight vigors (plasmids) for you to use this time around in the base game. You can equip two vigors at a time, switching between one or the other with a hot key. Vigors can be upgraded for efficacy and also charged up for a secondary fire functionality in combat. Combat is not as deep as Bioshock 1 or 2, but it is certainly not boring and can get intense at times. Collectible clothing gives you passive abilities and the tonic system provides you with a rechargeable shield. Health does not recharge, nor do your 'salts', the new Adam. There is not as much to do in between fights. Hacking is gone (though I guess it fits with the time period) and there is little exploration to do. You are presented with choices again since this is Bioshock.   (Design) The detail of this game is incredible. It might be the best looking game I have that runs the Unreal 3 Engine. The sounds and sights are something to behold. Each environment feels different though the music is not as emotional. There were no overlapping sound issues this time around too.  (Final Comments) This game left an impression on me, and there are not many games I say that about. While I consider it a departure from the series, I still highly recommend it based on its design and plot. Your first 30-40 minutes are some of the most memorable you may ever have in a game. The ending ties up the plot nicely and will get you thinking as well. Catch some coins and make the pilgrimmage to Colombia if you can handle the truth.  ",

You though the original Bioshock couldn’t be topped as a great interactive story telling medium, you thought wrong. Bioshock Infinite acts as its own standalone world, combining the fun aspects of old shooters (health and enemy spamming) with what’s good about newer shooters (limited weapon capacity and some regenerating health). It also made Elizabeth the right way to make an escort quest. She can’t die, doesn’t fight but provides ammo/health/salts/money/etc, revives when you die and can open tears that can assist in combat. Some say she’s escorting you, but that’s silly. This is how escort quests should be done. This game does so much right that it should be in everyone’s library.",

The DLC is impressive, but Burial At Sea: Episode 2 is where things really shine.

Filled with outward Racism, dark subject matters and *Spoilers* weird confusing time travel type plots. Now what I find interesting about this Bioshock title, is that the combat in all of the games have been pretty weak and have only held up because of the story, which is fine. Because the story is worth the price of admission and the games functionable.  However if you like mechanics in games you might want to wait till it goes on sale before you buy.

Great characters and an interesting narrative keep you going, but sadly the combat feels more rushed than in the previous two games and the villains not quite as memorable.  The skyhooks add an extra dimension and sense of scale to the combat but with enemies essentially charging towards you at great speed, you seldom have time to look around and admire the world quite as much as you did in those early levels in Rapture.  Still - it's a fine game with a superb ending.",

The characters, to be spacific, Elisabeth is an amazing exxcort. From being helpful to picking locks. This girl can do it all. I didn't feel much for the main character as in pervious bioshock games. You wake up not knowing who you are or can remember vage detials about why your there but that's it.  2. Columbia City, The fist view of the city, it's beach, carnival, and life like design. I'm convinced that if a city in the sky were to exists. It would be called Columbia and it would be hevean it'self. The city was so beautiful, I shed tires. Pure Graphic delight.   3. Give it some time in, it's fun! I had a lot of fun, from combat to upgrades, to rips in time, to air ship battles and even time travel!? What? It's a joy cause rips the game and this game is actually scarry at points. It's not a bad thing. It's welcome. Nice C sharp at the right times.    What i didn't like:  1. No maps. I wanna go back to that one vault lock i couldn't open. Sure, I know where it is, 30 minutes later, Ahhh fudge it.  2. Bad combat choices. Why the hell do i only have two guns? Why don't the vender's sell ammo or upgrades for the minigun? Why do I only have two vigor options on pc? No one gun has the same bullet size. Why aren't there any grandes or traps like a mine? No knife, why can't i pick one up?   3. Loading screens. It's not a big one as most loading screens have loaded under 30 secs but i felt that if they weren't there. The game could have been a lot better.    This game is a roller coaster ride, all the things i didn't like are minor and close to nothing in the game This is a Grade A title. 5 stars, A must own in my book.",

The environments have distinct atmospheres down to the background conversations of the NPCs, and the levels stay fairly linear while managing to feel oddly sandbox-like.

However, despite introducing Sklines and the new combat, tactics and movement methods associated with this, the majority of the game itself was little more than a repainting and name changing excercise. Tonics and Eve became Vigors and Salt etc. Although many new weapons were interoduced, the majority of these were effectively either of two factions' particular versions of the same firearm. Minigames such as the hacking were removed altogether and the upgrades to weapons, whilst numerous, seemed to target a more 'preferred weapon' focus. The ability to use tears and scenery props although introducing more of a preferential gameplay style and some embellished tactics, it didn't have the impact for me of a truly innovative addition. The storyline was typically Levine, and darkly risque with some shocking revelations and cutscenes as one would expect, halthough the ending did contradict the premise somewhat (but this is largely irrelevant and a debate which has been discussed enough elsewhere) as with any fictional accounts with certain thematic or plot aspects based on scieentific endeavour there must always be an element of suspension of disbelief and an acceptance of ignoring 'real worlod contradictions' in order to allow the story in the first place, yet the boundaries of the world given in BSI are pushed much further and harder than ever they were in BS1 and 2. I also found the story to be less engaing and intriguing, perhaps due to their being so many motifs and world-elements introduced throughout that whilst making Columbia a larger and more complex world than Rapture, it also alienated any real morality and reality from the main characters encountered to an extent in which there was little true empathy or sympathies invoked. In all, I think I found the game just had less gameplay substance than the likes of BS 1 and 2, but perhaps this may be due to changing trends in videogames overall and the demands of the console market consumers. This 'review' has been a lot more of a comparison between BSI and its prequels combined with my expectations. Whilst this may have lead to any objectivity being forcibly redundant, I believe that most playing this for the first time whill have also previously enjoyed BS1 at least and maybe also BS2. At the end of the day, I certainly enjoyed playing BSI and it still deserves a replay in the near future.",

However, the steampunk-ish look of Infinite was appealing, not to mention colourful (unlike the first two, which were mostly blue and green, which got old fast). And colourful is it ever!  Graphics aside, the game is a rather standard shooter - nothing has been reinvented here. It's very linear, very straightforward; had it held your hand any more than it did, I'd have called it a rail shooter. But the gameplay is solid and certainly fun.  However, the shooting aspect is not why you play this game. The narrative is what really keeps you going. I can't praise the writing of this game enough. It is convoluted at times, but it makes sense... in an odd, screwed-up sort of way. And hopefully opens the door to many more iterations within this universe.  Long story made short, it's a really awesome game. However, worth at most 20$ as the game can be rather... short. I spent about 9 hours in the main game and finished the primary campaign... and I'm not sure it warrants a second playthrough for any other reasons than achievement hunting (which I really don't really care much about). Getting it at 15$ is really a sweet spot for me, but 20$, though higher than I'd really like, is still a very good price. Get it when it's cheap and you won't regret it!!",

Now, just finished playthrough and I was immersed in the story from beginning to end. Exploring EVERYWHERE gave real depth to the world with the aid of voxaphones, conversations and general background. Don't just blitz through the game if you want full storyline value as I imagine you will quickly become confused by what is happening. Note: This isn't a completely 'open' world, so you won't get too sidetracked going through all the doors on your journey forward. I found myself making sure I went everywhere the game was NOT trying to get me to go before I would move forward.  The graphics were well polished for the most part - I had them set on high which caused a bit of stuttering upon entering some new areas, but overall very smooth despite my system being on the old side.  The actual gameplay which was interspersed with the story was relatively generic FPS. Set the difficulty higher for a greater challenge and use of strategy, or lower if you want to have fun messing around with vigor/combat combos. Doesn't matter as the storyline was really the main focus for me in this game.  A note on autosaving: I have seen a few comments complaining about the lack of save feature in this game. I get what the game is going for here though: They want you to face the consequences of death (loss of a bit of money and small health regen of enemies) rather than have you quicksave right before facing a harder battle. It's a bit annoying for real world timing trying to figure out if you will be able to quit the game in the next 5 minutes or not, but as long as you pay attention to when it is saving (rotating circle in the corner) or when it tells you the time your last quicksave was before you quit, there shouldn't be any nasty surprises when you log in again to find you lost 20 minutes of progress.  Lots of fun - will definitely have to play again in 1999 mode once I've worked my way through other games =/.",

            "review_text": "This review is after I have beaten the game multiple times, read up on the lore of the game, watched other people's gameplay and various commentary on the story. I have had this game since it came out.  This game was over hyped by far. The hype is the biggest problem I find surrounding the game. The game play is average at best. The story telling is phenomenal, though the story itself is shoddy. Other than the hype, the game is decent.  The only thing this game had that was good was the art style, game sounds, and presentation. Otherwise everything else was just pure hype. The story took a turn, but it was only shocking because it makes no sense and is irrational. The way the game presented the story was great, but the story itself was weak and full of Deus ex machina at every turn. The story just has too many plot holes, and it just expects you to go along with everything without questioning what is happening. Its exactly like the Lutece's quote 'The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exist…'. People desperately try to make sense of the story despite the fact that it doesn't make sense.   The game's themes were really nice and atmospheric. The whole hype about how 'deep' game was due to its biblical/nationalism/racism/sexist themes and stuff was just pure fluff. The game was rather intellectually shallow. They used the themes extremely well but the game offered no real thought or commentary into these matters. Of course it probably seemed deep to the people who are woefully ignorant of history and politics. Don't get what I am saying wrong. The game make great use of these things, and made it seem extremely authentic. Its just not deep or thought provoking as all the unintellectually sheltered people would make you think it is.  The game play was woefully stale. Generic FPS game play with no innovation. Difficulty levels don't do anything other than make the enemies tank a few more bullets, and hit a bit harder. Enemy AI never posed a real threat other than the Handy Mans, Firemen, and Zealot guys... but they weren't so much of a threat because they were good enemies, they were just bullet sponges that hit very hard. I never really felt the need to do anything in this game but just stand in place and just blast everything that came my way. Never really needed to take cover, move around etc against most of the enemies. Not only is the enemy AI overwhelming boring, there isn't even enough enemies to kill to even enjoy a fire fight due to how dumb they are.  My other gripes are the fact that you can't actually pick up and store anything that you find around the world. Trash can with money but I can't pick up the money due to the fact that there is a valuable medic kit in there... because you simply can't only pick up one thing. Everything you find is instantly consumed if you chose to pick it up. The game also ruins the sense of immersion in other little ways like for instance if you use the possession vigor on vending machines, you see it pop out like 20 silver eagles, but when you actually pick it up ends up being only like 1 to 3 silver eagles. Also possession is a useful vigor, but I hate how it constantly gives you the 'Don't Attack Allies' message, and reduces the damage you do to what you posses by like 95%. So if you posses something that is hard to kill, after the vigor wears of its still very hard to kill if you're not willing to waste all your ammo trying to kill what you possessed when its under your control. Not to mention the abominable auto save function. If they wanted to only let you save at certain points, then that is fine as long as they let us manually save at those points... but instead this game auto saves for you and overwrites your previous play throughs. Not to mention how far and in between the save points are.  So yeah the game has great story telling which I would recommend, but the game play isn't worthy of a recommendation. So what I would do if you wanted to just see the story is just go on youtube and watch a youtube video where someone spliced all the important parts together into a Bioshock Infinite Movie. That way you save your time and your money.  Overall the game is just a generic FPS game in term of game play. Pretty sub par in my opinion. The game has more story telling/theatrical value than actual game play. The game play is playable... just not very fun. The plot line is Deus ex machina, pseudo-science to the max, but the story telling is great.",

Being a fan of the Bioshock franchise since the very beginning, I couldn't pass up the chance to play this game the moment I could.

The story is incredibly moving, making you naturally become attached to the protaganists main companion, Elizabeth, with ease. She has a relatable personality, and truely is such a unique character - helping you out in combat instead of becoming a burden.   The combat itself, despite hard to get used to at first, is incredibly fun. It is very satisifying to combine the usage of vigors with weapons, producing deadly combos and making you a force to be reckoned with. The vigors themselves are incredibly unique, varying from getting murderous crows to peck your foes to death, or grabbing them with water tentacles and throwing them off the floating city.   The music is charming - in more ways than one. It is incredibly atmospheric, and the way the music is used within the game is pure genius (But to say any more would be a spoiler!)   This game truely is a game that has to played in order to be properly experienced. I simply couldn't recommend it enough. It is one of the greatest games I've ever played, allowing me to have huge amounts of fun, all while being emotionally invested in a touching and exciting story. 10/10.",

Plasmids are no longer called as such, they are now Vigors and they bring a whole set of new powers. The weapons in the game follow into two categories, Vox and Columbian, both categories have essentially the same weapons with their counterparts having minor differences in some stats. The game, while fun to play and be surprised by the story as it progressed had no room to change what happen when you replayed the game, really the only way that I found a need to load the game up after playing it a second time was to play the DLC, which was still fairly fun. Quite honestly, if you only want a game to play once for a decent story an beautiful art, this would be it, but it even lacks the multiple ending feature to work for like the previous Bioshock games.",

            "review_text": "After going back and playing the game over again, I've decided to change my mind. Let's get straight to it shall we?  The Combat: 7/10 The combat in this game can either be really fun or really frustating. Most of the weapons are decent, but only being able to carry two means you've got to really plan ahead. Ammo runs out very fast and before you know it, you find yourself using whats left of your vigors or trying to melee which usually doesn't go very smoothly. The shield is a nice addition, but you can only use health packs. No carrying spare health packs or vigor bottles. The vigors are somewhat fun to use, but not as much as the other games. However, I like the early vigors/plasmids. My favorites were shock jockey (electricity), return to sender (basically telekinisis i think i spelled that wrong), and possession (only used to get money from vending machines lol). The others were cool but definitely went underused due to them being somewhat underpowered. The enemies are fun to kill, especially with the sky hook ('OH my God!' Elizabeth voice*). However, the boss battles are more frustrating than fun. I won't spoil anything, but people who played the game know exactly what I'm talking about. The weapons lacked in variety and were missing the visual/cosmetic upgrades that the other games head (i'm obsessed with customization and vaierty), but I still enjoyed getting important upgrades like extended mags/clips.  Graphics/Visual Style: 9/10 Visually this game is amazing. Its a very styled (but not cartoony) world and the aesthetics feel very real (for that time period, I was there, I should know).  Audio/Dialoque &amp; Voice Acting/Music: 9/10 Now before I didn't like the voice acting this game has. The voice acting sounds like a script for a Hollywood version of an amazing book. Some of the story is very rushed. However, I will not deny that the voice actors are still incredible and skilled so i will give them their props as it still felt like it was coming from a movie and not a voice actor wearing headphones are reading a script (fallout:new vegas matthew perry *COUGH*). The dialogue is still great, it just has too many cliche things, although that doesn't always mean bad, just a tad overused. The score is very well done. The loading screen song that plays is stuck in my head and I immediately recognized it when I was watching The Sting the other day. Everything fits very well.  The Story: 7/10 While the story starts out very interesting and engaging, when it's over, you feel like there's a big chunk you missed. The clues and twists are very rushed and teased in your face almost instantly. I think that they were rushed to release this considering the number of times it was delayed in the past. I would take a delayed game that was worth the wait over a rushed game any day, just like basically every gamer out there. Take your time developers. Anyways, decent story, but really short.  All in all, I think you should play this game.  Overall: 8/10",

So after 1 and 2, I was super pumped to play Infinite, and I am not in the least disappointed.  As Bioshock is a narrative shooter, much was expected of Infinite's story, and BOY DID IT DELIVER. The story is extremely well written and layered, with great use of twists and symbols galore. The characters also felt real, rounded, and furnished, I loved them. This game pioneers video games as an art form.  One common complaint in Bioshock 2 is that Rapture had outstayed its welcome, and was awesome, but less awesome than the first time. Ken Levine certainly kept that in mind while developing this game. The city of Columbia is amazingly new and beautiful, and I found myself taking screenshots left and right. It felt to me, though, that the environment was less of a weapon in this one. But the skylines and open areas made up for that change.  The combat is the best of all the Bioshock games. I had a lot of fun using Vigors and shooting people in the face, and aiming down my sights was convenient and useful. Infinite plays more like a straightforward shooter than the other two, although that is not at all bad.  Infinite was also the most well optimized of all three games on Steam, I had no issues running the game whatsoever.  I would recommend this game to people who have played the first two games or even people new to the series; it is an experience like no other.",

            "review_text": "Ok, so finally came around to complete this game.  Bioshock Infinite, created by the same people that made the first game, the story takes place in a city in the skies, I won't explain much of the story itself, most people already know the setting of this game.  In BioShock Infinite, you spend most of your time in the flying city Columbia. It is an very well designed city, with alot of stuff going on there, and it feels like a real city. The only downside is that it's not as open as I would have wished for. There is side missions, and stuff to look for and extra places to visit, but the game itself is pretty linear, so there is unfortunatly not much to explore of the city itself. The side-missions, I do have a problem with. Most of them includes backtracking, but the fustraiting part is that you don't really get a clear indicator of where you have to go, or where the side-mission is, there's no waypointer, or map location, you have to backtrack and blindly look for it.  The graphics in this game is good. It's very pretty in it's own style, Dx11 effects, it bears the Bioshock style, but it COULD, have maybe been a tad better on some areas, but still, the graphics are good.  The gameplay is fun, it has alot of action, and experimenting with all the different 'powers' you find through out the game, few weapon choises, well, technically there are a fine number of weapons, but many of them are 'super' versions of each other. The skyrails brings with it some fun tactical advantages you can use during battles, and combining it with weapons and your 'powers', it's a fast phased fun gameplay.  The only complaint, is that when you die, you respawn, with half health and with the same ammo you had when you died, so if you died with no ammo, you'll respawn with little health and no ammo (or almost no ammo), but the enemies you failed to kill before you died, will regain some health, so if you died because you ran out of ammo, you will respawn close to where you died, with little health and no ammo, while the enemy has regained some health. So this brings up some fustraiting situations which at times might seem like a paradox and impossible to progress through.  The story of Infinite... Here I really can't say much, but the story manages to capture your interest, it is one of the main things making you want to see how it all ends and see the final conclution. But there are some aspects of the story that, after you've completed, you'll think 'Why did I have to do that? What purpose do this serve?'. So some 'side' stories that don't really have much to do with the main story can feel like something put in there to make the game longer.  But the ending is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of plot twists and surprizes. A true Bioshock ending. It is one of the most suprising endings I have seen in a long time, and it's really worth playing this game because of it.  But I do advice, the story of Bioshock Infinite do have alot of elements from Quantum Physics/Mechanics, so if you really want to understand the ending, go read up on Quantum mind ♥♥♥♥ first.  ---SCORE---  Graphics: 8.5/10 Audio: 8.0/10 Gameplay: 8.0/10 Story: 9.0/10 Value: 7.0/10  Score: 8.1/10",

While the environments, and citizens could use a little bit more diversity and work, the story line and enemies make the game all worth the while. The soundtrack gets an A, with the creative use of the tears connecting the timelines of the 80's 90's 70's and 60's. I thought their use of anachronism was amazing, Having tears play music such as Fortunate son, Everybody wants to rule the world, Tainted Love, and girls just want to have fun, and then having a NPC in the game's story line recreating the music as if it was his own was a tremendous detail to the game, it really drove the nail into the wood, that Space and Time were colliding as a result of the City floating.

Quite simply, it's one of the most well scripted, thought-out and engrossing tales to grace not only this medium, but of all fictional creations.

In many ways, much more and in others much less. 2k took a risk by catapulting you from the bottom of the ocean to above the clouds, and I must say that after some skepticism, I am glad they did.   Actionwise this game also took a big step forward and managed to make the mobfights a lot more interesting, faster and desperate. A wider arrange of weapons than in the first two games, limited by the fact that you can only carry two at the time (no changeable ammunition like in the second game, though I don't miss that at all). At first I was kind of annoyed by that fact, but the game managed to integrate that in a manner that made it much more smooth and realistic than it was ever before.   AI-wise you may not see a big difference in comparison to the first two games, but companionwise they took it to a whole nother level. Elizabeth is one of the few companions (much like Alyx from Half-Life) whose company I genuinley enjoyed and who I found, is pretty much irreplaceable in fights. She brings a whole new dynamic to it, while staying independent at the same time, somehting that I wish more developers put into thought when creating female characters. It might sound ridiculous, though I guess that people on a gaming platform such as this will understand, but in the course of this, admittedly, short 10 hour adventure (hardcore mode and a second playthrough to discover everything I missed not included) I really started to care for her and her story.  Columbia itself was a little bit to superficial for me, leaving me with a lot of questions. There's an ongoing fight between two groups, inspired by political uproars and racial segregation. I don't know why, but to be honest, amidst all the fighting and the main story you try to understand I....didn't really care. I don't consider myself an insensitive person, not at all, but it felt kind of out of place, though it fits the time setting (tough to explain). There's also the handymen,  who...What?  Why? How? Columbia is cleaner and happier than Rapture (no suprise there) and the chilly, angsty atmosphere from before is replaced by 60's charme and steampunk metal horses.  The story might be a bit confusing at first, assembling itself mostly from made up theories through voice recordings, though they didn't have the grim charme I remembered from before, but in the end everything fits together in a way that'll make you gaping at your screen.  TL;DR: I hesitated with this one, because there are a lot of changes one might disagree with if they played the first two parts. Try it. You might be suprised at how much you won't miss Rapture at all.",

            "review_text": "Bioshock infinite is an amazing fps and is a must-play game.   Graphics- The graphics are not realistic, however, they are designed in a pretty and colorful way. It feels alive and there's amazing atmoshpere to it. Even if it's not realistic it's still easy to know what is being seen and not you won't be left wondering what is on screen. The framerate is never below 60fps and will sometimes climb to 100. That just makes the experience better.  Sound- Beautiful. The sound has people conversating, yelling, insulting, singing, mechanics working, guns shooting, bells ringing, and there's a very high level of voice acting to express emotion. There is battle music but it's the sam one for every battle scene save for a few final battles. It is tolerable at the least.  Layout- More focussed but not linear. There ares still different paths to take and alternatives routes. It's not rapture layout but it doesn't entirely take away the bioshock feel to it.  A.I.- The enemies have varieties such as runnning up and hitting, sniping or shooting with guns behind cover. Even when there's A.I vs A.I, both sides act like they're fighting the player. Some enemies use vigors and even skyrails.  Vigors- Theres a total of 8 vigors and they all help out. There are specific areas where they can be very helpful, especially with elizabeth and some vigors alone are good against bosses. Like using crows to get a chance to get some distance from the handyman.  Skyhook- The skyhook is impressive. There's certain areas where the hook is essential to reaching supplies or circling around enemies. Since you can wield a gun while using the skyhook and control your velocity, you can really make manuvers in an area. It's also fun to punch people with it. Of course, it's doesn't always make it easy kill weapon since when doing air strikes on heavy armor enemies won't kill them and the handiman can make it where being on the rails will hurt/kill you.  Guns- You can only hold two like in C.O.D but there are upgrades and abilities to pick up/buy ammo. And with elizabeth's help, when running low on ammo, she'll give you more letting you continue shooting. There's also a large variety to use and each one has a unique purpose.  Elizabeth- Most helpful companion. She has real expression and emotion. And during battle, she is so incredibly helpful that when she's not with you, you will wish she was. Plus, the tears are the best since if certain ones don't kill the enemies, it will distract them long enough for you to attack them.  Story- Mind blowing. Of all the stories I've known, This is a combination of plot twist, surprising, amazing and saddening. This is like the F.E.A.R series where, if you don't pay attention you will be confused.  Fianl rating 9.5/10. My only gripe is the same battle sound, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it and playing it again 4 times. ",

Cook over a med-high flame, stirring frequently so that the potatoes don't burn. Salt lightly. Takes about 15 minutes to cook. When done, the outside should be a little crunchy, the inside moist. Onions will blacken, that’s fine. Remove from heat and set aside to dry in some paper towels or coffee filters.  Next, start the bacon, just plop that in a skillet and cook it for 3 minutes, flip, cook for 2 more minutes then add to your potatoes. While the potatoes are cooking, you can start to prepare your eggs. Just crack all 3 into a cup, add the milk and seasonings you want. Mix it up so it’s a uniform yellow. Get a medium skillet warmed up.   THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! The fire MUST NOT be too high or YOU WILL BURN THE OMELETTE! It needs to be a low flame. Heat up the skillet, grease it with cooking SPRAY or butter, and then drop in the egg mixture. if you didn't stir it enough you will see an egg yolk in your pan. If you do, just make scrambled eggs.   If you did it right, the eggs should cook slowly. As they start to become solid on the bottom of the pan (but still runny enough to move around the pan, it will be 2 layers), add a layer of cheese over HALF of the omelet (not too much, you will add more later and the grease from the cheese will RUIN the flip). Add the bacon and potatoes over the cheese, then add more cheese. Once the eggs are almost completely solid, take a spatula and start to lift up the edges around the side that is empty, this will be the side you FLIP onto the other. Once you can move most of the empty side, you will put the spatula under the middle of the empty side and GENTLY slide it all the way to the middle of the omelet. Then you will lift slowly and try to create a half circle by folding one half over the other. Turn off the heat and transfer it to a plate.  If done right, you just made an amazing breakfast THAT WILL GET YOU LAID! Don’t ever underestimate a home cooked meal. It will get you in bed with someone 99 out of 100 times.   Use this power responsibly.         P.S. This game's ending will mindf*** you until you look it up, or you will be thinking of it for the rest of your life.  9/11 -George Bush",

Although its normal difficulty may be a bit too easy for most, combat is so smooth and frantic that it remains ultra-satisfying nonetheless. Play this game: The Burial at Sea DLC is also more than worth the investment.",

It has everything a video game should have to ensure an experience the player will never forget; plentiful action scenes, characters that players grow to love and care for throughout the game and a story which makes you yearn to continue playing.   My favourite aspects of this game are simply exploring the wonderful and beautiful world of Columbia, finding all the Voxophones and discovering the story. I enjoy how this game, as well as Bioshock 1 and 2, doesn't give you the entire story but allows the player to piece together the wider story for themselves. To flesh out the bones presented to you.  It's characters are amazing. Booker and Elizabeth grow on the player the more you go through the game, to the point where you physically care about them by the end. They both grow as people, as they travel through Columbia's floating streets, and so do you as the player. They make you laugh, cry and, most importantly, think. Comstock remains a mystery, even after the game ends but he still remains a powerful force in the game. But by far the greatest characters in this entire game are the Lutece twins, Robert and Rosalind, they are both omniscient guides and odd comic relief.  The game play is smooth and easy to master, on both keyboard and mouse and controller. You never feel like you're doing finger contortionism while playing, like other games on the market.   This game is a must play, for everyone who loves amazing storylines and griping character. Buy this game, buy it now!",

An example are the 'choices' you're given none of them affect the outcome but they are reminders throughout as most are aesthetic but still have an effect remininding you of that coice throughout. Which I think is rather realistic in that sense. Since in real life choosing to go out to the pub will not (hopefully) affcet the entire town/city but you will have that memory in your mind when walking by that pub.  Gameplay wise it is very linear and does not massivley reward exploration which can cause a few cool little things to be missed like a guitar scene or references to other games. The Gme is VERY story driven. It is clear that the developers focused on story more than gameplay. Though I do not mind as I like a game with a great story. If you do not usually care about story and are usually a CoD/Battlefield multiplayer person then this is not for you. The gameplay is very similar to Dishonored.  Honestly I loved the game, it's story, the little sub stories that add more explantion to the story and the memorable characters such as Elizabeth and the Lutece 'siblings' who turn up quite a bit throughout the story.  My rating? 10/10  which is brilliant as I rarely would give any other game a 10.",

Pros:  Beautiful graphics Great atmosphere Amazing story Interesting charactors Wonderful voice acting A killer ending  Cons:  Not the best combat No multiplayer Doesn't relate too much to the first two games   This is a masterpiece, and I'd reccomend it to almost anyone. If you're wondering about why its rated M, I'll tell about the worst of each of its 'content descriptors'  Blood and Gore: when shooting people there are blood splatters, and when getting a headshot with a shotgun their heads disappear and blood squirts out of their body. You can also do a 'melee execution', which can include sawing into their neck, breaking their neck, cutting their head off, and more of that nature. When you consume a 'vigor' you see prolonged images of your hands going through a transformation. You see your hands burning to the bone, crystals shooting out of them, and other gory displays.  Intense Violence: You witness someone being stabbed in the back with a sharp pair of scissors. She falls and slowly dies. You also kill a man by repeatedly whacking his head against stone and forcfully drowning him.  Language: Nothing too bad here. Your charactor says 'what the hell', 'God d**n it', 's**t', and 'son of a b**ch'. Elizabeth says 'oh my God', and 'd**n', but very infrequently.  Mild Sexual Themes: I actually haven't noticed much. Elizabeth's breasts are slightly exposed throughout the game, but not more than you see the streets these days. I've also been told theres a porn shop somewhere with mild suggestive images, but I haven't seen it.  Use of Alchohol and Tobacco: You see a few people smoking on the streets of Columbia. You can also smoke a cigarette to regain health, but only at the beginning of the game. I think you can also consume liquor.  There is also racism, but you're never forced to take part in it. This game was a wonderful expierience, I by all means reccomend it!",

Pros: •Amazing graphics for a game nearly 3 years old •Interesting and thought-provoking story •High quality voice acting •Well crafted combat system using tears, vigors, and an assortment of weapons  Cons:  •I often found myself forgetting about the vigors; they are not necessary to defeat enemies or pass most areas •Slightly repetitive in the middle of the storyline; you go back and forth, looking for things that lead you back to where you started  I got infinite and Bioshock 1 and 2 for 10$ on sale... 100% worth it. I recommend this game to anyone interested in an engaging story, beautiful visuals, and exciting gameplay.  The ending is a beautifully crafted finish and a real mind bender.",

With a rather mysterious beggining that unravels as the player goes on, to the climax of the entire whihc ecompasses the entire known Bioshock universe; I just could not stop playing. The characters that take you on your jounrey are nice enough and a little less cliche, especially when you consider the relationship Booker and Elizabeth share. The game is visually stunning. The artists and developers really did create a breath taking game with incredible sights. The gameplay is as it is in the Bioshockl series with gunplay, tonics, upgrades and the works. However this time round you can only carry two weapons, which seems lacking. Overall it is a great game and one of the best of this year.",

I often bemoan the lack of complex storytelling and believable characters in modern games, particularly first person action games, but this series absolutely excels in weaving a believable yet fantastical world populated with wonderful characters and with its own unique, beautiful aesthetic.  This third iteration has a very different setting to the previous two subaquatic worlds, as it is set in the floating city of Columbia. I don't want to give any of the plot away, as it is a joy to experience; suffice to say, Elizabeth is now one of my favourite ever characters in a game. I really felt myself caring about her and wanting DeWitt to be the hero. Of course, nothing is quite as it seems in Bioshock... the ending has a great twist, which I'd partly anticipated, but not in quite the way it eventually went down! The 20 minutes or so leading up to the finale is really trippy, riffing on multiverse theory in a really cool way.  My only minor criticism might be that the combat can feel a little clunky at times, but I could definitely overlook that given how fantastic it is overall. At 16 hours to complete the game on my first playthrough, during which I explored every nook and cranny of each area, I'd say it's not exactly the longest game ever either; but I'll take this kind of quality over quantity any day!  If you love games with bags of character and are looking for a plot which will suck you in, you have to buy this game!",

The smooth gameplay and graphics add even more to the immersiveness that you actually feel like you are part of the game. The supporting characters are full of life and emotion that you develop feelings for them, even for the main antagonist. The enemies you encounter in ech level are lifeless however. The story did feel very confusing in some parts throughout the game, but it didn't affect my experience.

Best, most useful heroine I've ever seen and interact with.  The story? Man, never been ♥♥♥♥ed up like this. Unexpected, and baffled me for moments.  Been in Rapture, twice to be exact, and a brief revisit to the city under the ocean gave me chill and nostalgia at the same time. The previous installments have such mind-boggling story, but this one gave me a wholly new level of being mind♥♥♥♥ed.  The arsenal Columbia offered is delicious; in fact, the six-shooter Hand Cannon in Columbia is the best I've ever handle. Never missed my mark, every bullet counts. Seeing helmets and hats flung off one's head gave me the savor of gunslinging action. One of the most satisfying shooting gallery I've ever experienced.  9/10 would get myself around Elizabeth again.",

It personally is my favorite if I had to choose between BioShock Infinite, Skyrim, and Fallout 4.   Then while it just looks like a normal FPS with guns and such, it has a great fighting mechanic with the multiple different vigors you pick up throughout the game. I also enjoyed being able to just pick up a different weapon what seemed like all the time; don't wanna use the shotgun anymore? There's probably a carbine rifle any number of places nearby.   Characters are also a great thing in this game. Elizabeth is a great companion and provides a great story for the game.  There's also great scenery. I guess there's something 'effing awesome about a flying city where it's always sunny and everyone is content. Except that's where the creepy, eerie feeling comes in. The people make you feel like a complete outsider but provide this calm but very very creepy feeling that you don't belong there.   I'm gonna go ahead and stop before I start spoiling the game. 10/10, one of the best games I have ever played.  TL;DR - really good game, buy it",

            "review_text": "I want to hate Bioshock Infinite. Gameplay-wise Infinite is two large steps backward from 2 and 1. The two-weapon loadout is directly at odds with combat design that still calls for managing your limited health, ammo, and (basically) magic resources in battles that often involve a significant number of high-health enemies. It's not uncommon to fight mechanized bullet-sponges who will burn through your bullets far too easily unless you have an explosive-thrower taking up a slot (and that's even when compensating for any limitations in your arsenal with magic). Combat is simultaneously broken and generic, and this is most obvious when you try to do something interesting with your weapon loadout or are separated from the excessive health drops and the item-dispenser named 'Elizabeth' (her role in combat really isn't more than a crutch for broken design).  However, Infinite easily has the most compelling world when compared to the 2 previous games. Bioshock 1 was good, but the lack of opportunity to see the world in a coherent state (before the fall of sanity) made the denizens of the underwater world about as interesting as gibbering monkeys can be. Bioshock 2 was all about the gameplay; development of the world relied too heavily on the first game and the main villain seemed out of place. Infinite gives players the opportunity to see more of the people of its world, and is all the more compelling for it.  The writing of Infinite isn't perfect. A few too many fights felt like pointless set-ups to waste the players time. The ending itself was poorly thought out. However, almost every other aspect of the story telling for this game is of a quality I don't think I've ever seen before in a game. It's worth experiencing.",

The floating city is beautiful and fun to explore, and the other characters, groups, enemies etc are all really well done.  I'm not a big fan of the 'pick two guns at any one time' combat philosophy (as you only ever take the guns you feel most comfortable so never really explore all weaponry, alternative modes etc), and you never earn enough money to upgrade all powers and weapons. To be honest, the combat of the game was a bit 'meh' for me because of this, but the story was gripping enough to keep me playing, and I don't regret it!  Overall I finished the game with that feeling you get when you finish a really engorssing book and you instanlty miss the main characters. Thankfully I've got the DLC to play now!  P.S. Make sure you watch the credits to the end to catch a beautiful video of a duet between the two lead voice actors.",

Without giving anything away, the ending is a COMPLETE mind♥♥♥♥ that will leave you speechless, and thinking for days. The character interactions and chemistry, especially between Booker and Elizabeth, is a absolute joy to watch. This is a very cinematic game, with very cinematic characters. The gameply, while nothing groundbreaking, is simple and fun, which I find lacking in a lot of games nowadays. The vigors are especially fun to mess around with, lots of replay value in terms of different weapons and new vigors. The game is rather beautiful, especially when you see the floating city of Columbia for the first time. But the joyful enviroment will soon turn to a hostile one as the game progresses.

The outlook wasn't brilliant for poor Booker D. that night, While sitting in a lifeboat, with the lighthouse gleaming bright; And when the rowers vanished, and the surface did the same, A sickly silence fell upon the hero of this game.  And in the rocket pod he sat, bewildered,yet impressed, As he drifted past the Monument, and as 'pilgrim' was addressed; He thought, though much befuddled, 'I can swing this rescue yet -  Bringing them the girl, to wipe away the debt.'   But Booker's fame preceded him, as did the prophet's hate;  And the former was a mystery, and the latter was his fate. So upon our calm protagonist, grim melancholy lay, As he wandered through Columbia, one pleasant summer's day.  For there were weird anomalies, awaiting on this trip: An odd predictive telegram, and a coin that he must flip; When he came upon the fairground, a baseball in his grasp, The telegram proved Prophetic, and the 'Shepherd' was entrapped.   The policemen sent to fetch him, though, emerged in fearful shape, As DeWitt procured his skyhook in a bloody quick escape; He killed the hothead fireman, and the soldiers' onslaught checked, As the presence of the Shepherd began to have a mass effect.   And he struck a blow for freedom, put the Ravens in their place, Stole Lizzie from the statue, with a grimace on his face, Endured the propaganda, so veiled and ornate, And in the halls of history, found cause to clean his Slate.  Ten thousand Founders fought him, and found that fighting hurts; Ten thousand Vox applauded him in another universe. Fitzroy had incited them, the Prophet's rule to end, And Comstock wouldn't tolerate this Columbian-mocha blend.  For now the Vox Rebellion was heady in the air, As Booker and Elizabeth chased gunsmiths through the tears; He found himself a martyr, the rebels’ hero dead; 'That ain't my style,' said Booker, as in a blimp he fled.  From the working town of Finkton, though, the city fell to storm;  And through Emporia's empty streets, a trail of blood was worn. A strange and spectrous spectacle was born from daughter's hate -  And through the touch of mother's hand, they opened Comstock's gate.  Our hero passed through time and space, by silent boys forlorn, And through the future's meddling, a self from past was warned; One mountain drowned in fire; one spared from Prophet's rage -  And the note was found to be the key to break the Songbird's CAGE.   The bird succumbed to atmosphere, as was his destiny, As the pair both stood enraptured, in the city beneath the sea; They saw the timestreams branching through a million lighthouse doors, In a world most Irrational, where futures are restored.  But the memories stored in Booker's mind were all subject to change, In this universal chess game that the physicists arranged; For to save himself and Anna, a destiny is faced -  And at the river delta, his parallels erased.  Oh, somewhere in the multiverse, the stars are twinkling bright, And Jack is fighting Atlas, 'mid Rapture's neon lights, And always there's a city, where twin Luteces pout; But there is no more Columbia...  ... for mighty Comstock was struck out.   - ZeroKelvin &amp; Ernest Thayer",

Sometimes the story seemed slow and plodding and the villain annoyingly flat. In addition, until the ending the game appears to just be a shooter with powers and the Bioshock name slappedo n it. Despite this, B:I made a greart comeback with its mind-warping pseudo-Lovecraftian ending, as well as tying itself into the Bioshock universe. I would give this game a strong 8/10.  Pros: AMAZING ENDING Decent story Cool main character Some interesting integration of real-world histroy, albiet altered to fit the stroy a bit  Cons: The combat was kind of... eh at times Very hard to get through the middle in terms of motivation Some powers were tricky to use, so i gave up on them Want a decent weapon? Ok, here it is with one bullet.",

I'm especially fond of thesteampunk aesethic,which is hard to do in an original and imaginative manner.Even the player with the poorest aim can find something entertaining in this game.The music is easily the best in any recent game,and the anachronistic versions of modern pop song done in 1912 ragtime manner are ridiculously enjoyable.

            "review_text": "After countless debates in the industry concerning whether or not video games can be considered art, Bioshock: Infinite has come along to silence them. An accomplishment in story telling and the crafting of a world so imaginative in terms of originality and intrigue, it should rest proudly amongst any collection of games (along with the original Bioshock) as the ending to a series of pointless arguments. Not many games can be considered as such, but this one can hold its head up high and know it’s definitively so.  A rather grand departure from Rapture, Columbia is beautiful, sunny and filled with racist albeit, happy people. Rapture was a special place too but it was a deserted wasteland at the bottom of the sea, littered with as many ideals as bodies. A complete shift in atmosphere, Infinite trades dark, lonely and claustrophobic for an effulgent and spacious place with a creepy sense of community. The micro-interactions you encounter with the hundreds of lively people walking around and chatting about Columbia are mind blowing when recalling the hours spent alone in the corridors of Andrew Ryan’s sunken utopia.  There’s a moment for everyone with a pulse. Maybe it’s when the wind pushes a lonely beach umbrella across the sand or even one as obvious as when the doors open, exposing a sprawling and floating city landscape. Regardless of how or when, it will come and when it does, it will devastate you. After all, Columbia feels lighter than air.  A man with a debt is barely a man at all. Desperate for the opportunity to escape his burden, Booker Dewitt takes a less than favorable job, his deal: “Bring us the girl, wipe away the debt”. Before he knows it, he’s on a boat in the middle of the ocean. A lighthouse stands cloaked in solace, a storm rages above. The darken clouds scream and weep at his arrival. Atop a chair awaits, whisking him above the angry effervescence to the gleam of perfect blue skies and sunshine.  A somber yet delightful patter of keys roll over, a tune of emptiness plays as he floats down upon the city of Columbia, a place that itself is made of more empty spaces than concrete or brick. A burgh gliding all around the world, a shining example of American exceptionalism, powered by the word and will of demagogue Zachary Hale Comstock. His title of “Prophet” is a dangerous one, every time his visions come true his following grows in size and belief. Subsequently, they perceive Comstock’s prejudice as yet another prophecy.  As Jeremiah Fink tells us in relation to all this “prophecy business”, belief is a commodity. It’s apparent just how popular a product it is to the people of Columbia when it’s plastered on every wall, hanging from every ledge and shouted from the voice of every citizen standing at street’s corner. Comstock knows he won’t be around forever the same way he knows belief isn’t cheap, so he’s planting seeds that will influence them to follow another. “The seed of the Prophet shall sit the throne and drown in flame, the mountains of man.”  Elizabeth like any Disney princess is beautiful, clever and highly capable. Years spent locked away from a city that desperately needed her haven’t been wasted. She prides herself on knowing a great bit from all she’s read. Among those piles of books and the heaps of knowledge she ascertained, she’s read enough about lock picking to pick any door in Columbia. Coupled with her ability to create tears into reality, which allow Booker to select a tactical option on the battlefield, whether it be an automated turret or a weapon or a med kit, she is an incendiary addition to your already stunning arsenal.  As for your arsenal, it’s very punchy. Every vigor is colorful and brimming with power. Every weapon is finely tuned and accurate, all while delivering that explosive punch. The weapons aren’t overly original, mostly following the familiar tropes of shotgun, rifle, machine gun and RPG, but it was clear the intention was that originality be left to the vigors. The guns are the constants and the vigors are the variables. Coupling variables can be awfully fun, whether it be the lifting powers of bucking bronco and devil’s kiss exploding them mid-air or activating return to sender’s shield and going to town against some founders with undertow, blasting them off many ledges or knocking them down with the sole intent of purchasing more time to re-activate your shield, the combat is pure and fun though hardly the selling point of Bioshock: Infinite.  Anyone who came expecting a revolution to First Person shooters will be greatly disappointed and while grinding against sky-rails, firing upon deserving enemies can be seen as revolutionary, the true revolution of Bioshock: Infinite is it’s story. Nothing here feels like game filler, if you lose a character or the figurative ground you were standing on crumbles, it feels earned. The only derailment that occurs is whenever Booker detaches from a sky-rail, hanging over his destination.  Stunning visuals, an excellent cast of characters and an intensely arresting concept are the recipe for most great pieces of art and Infinite is no different. Not every video game is art, the same way not every movie or book is; the only difference is that in this medium, the occurrence of art is a lot less common. Which makes Infinite a welcome sight. Floating just out of the reach of perfection, Bioshock: Infinite tells a grand and masterful tale with greater consistency than the original. Columbia may seem far away to most but to any true gamer, a charter will always remain a permanent fixture inside their heart.",

I eagerly delved into the story not knowing a single thing about Columbia. The only thing I knew about Infinite was that it was a Bioshock title and I remember falling in love with Bioshock when it was first released.  The game isn't without its flaws and there is merit to some of the criticism about how combat is set up in the game. Do some areas feel like shooting gallerys? Yes. Did Infinite pull away from the concept of a single Splicer possibly meaning your death. Most definitely. However flaws aside, I would recommend this game to anyone for it's storytelling. Amazing visuals, great voice acting, and an extremely captivating delivery. I know that I'll revist the world of Columbia again and again.",

            "review_text": "The third entry in the BioShock series goes from sea to sky, exploring the airborne city of Columbia. Many of Infinite's basic story elements will be familiar to series veterans - a protagonist in over his head, a high-tech city led by an enigmatic man, a utopia rotting from within. Game elements will also be familiar to many; the Plasmids of Rapture are reimagined as Vigors, character-enhancing Gene Tonics are now pieces of clothing called Gear, and vending machines dot every corner of Columbia. Without spoiling any major plot elements, Infinite's story starts off a little more hard-hitting than its predecessors and only gets moreso the farther you get into the game; the big reveals at the end are at the same time obvious and unexpected.  Gameplay-wise, Infinite is somewhat more modernized that its predecessors. Your melee weapon is built-in, and you can only carry two guns at once, and the game expects you to swap out frequently rather than hang on to one or two. This unfortunately doesn't play well with the game's weapon upgrading system, forcing you to think carefully about which guns to spend money on. Large, open areas combined with a shield system makes combat more about quick, localized firefights than the brutal melees of Rapture. Alternate ammunition and hacking are both gone entirely.  Ultimately I came away from the game feeling almost like Irrational Games had too many ideas to really fit smoothly in one game, and ended up trying to make it work with a handful - the game was rebuilt in development several times, and it shows. While I don't feel like it hits the same peak the first BioShock did, Infinite certainly isn't a bad game. The turn-of-the-20th-century aesthetic makes Columbia both nostalgic and beautiful, and the shortcomings aren't so bad that I didn't enjoy playing.",

The writing is more consistent without an entire act of the game being filler.   Infinite's  own worst enemy is itself. Elizabeth is an extremely compelling character but anyone who saw the previews was waiting for her to start helping directly in battle, only to be disappointed. It's a shame that so much effort went into her and the end result is little more than item retrieval and scripted environmental effects. Having her actually tag along with Booker so she can progress as naturally through the story as he does is amazing in its own right, but in gameplay she falls flat. As simpler as it was, calling Eleanor to my side in  Bioshock 2,  basically summoning the game'srecurring miniboss flagged as friendly, felt far more satisfying. Also, why have we gone to a two-weapon system? I find it hard to believe Ken Levine looked at the last two games' inventories and said 'Needs more  Halo, ' yet here we are.  Elizabeth may fall flat in gameplay, but it's a joy to have her around for the entire game simply because she's a brilliantly realized character. Her interaction with Booker feels natural. The Lutece twins also steal the show whenever they show up.  While the writing doesn't have the first game's pacing problems, it has an entirely  different  pacing problem; the ending is incredibly rushed. The vague nuances of it that have seen so much discussion is really the result of this, not the result of actual depth. The ending is obtuse for the sake of being obtuse. At a certain point, the ending stops being about the characters and starts being about how long the characters can talk about quantum mechanics. Additionally, the setting and the conflict set up is very quickly thrown into the background, given only cursory relevance as an obstacle preventing Elizabeth and Booker from leaving Columbia. American exceptionalism is never explored beyond the fact that Comstock is absolutely crazypants nanners. The KKK substitute that one will spend all of ten minutes seeing seems shoehorned in. This isn't just dissapointing for players who kept up with the game's development, it's just sloppy storytelling. The game thinks that by simply bringing up a topic it's providing some sort of deep insight into that topic, but that's not how things work. Unfortunately,  Infinite  thinks it's a lot smarter than it actually is.  Despite some problems, Infinite is much better than the first game, but, while this opinion may not be popular, it's not as good as  Bioshock 2. ",

The story seems to be leading towards a certain direction until you finally meet elizabeth. From there the story takes a bit of turn. From then on the story becomes more and more convoluted, until the game finally ends. It seems as if the writers thought a baffling ending meant a good ending. All the while the gameplay begins to feel like more of a chore than fun. there are only a handful of unique enemies that are sparsely used throughout, making each fight feel like the last. Though the vigors and the rail system add a bit of diversity, they really cant overcome the rinse and repeat feel of the encounters. Meanwhile elizabeths special power seems very underutilised.   For being able to tear through time, space, and alternate realities   all she provides for you is extra ammo, and a friendly turret here and there. Even in terms of the story, elizabeths power is mainly used to skip over events. I felt that this was a very lazy move on part of the writers. Rather than have the player achieve their goal, the writers say   'elizabeth tears into an alternate reality! so now you dont have to do this objective! Because that would be totally boring, right?'   Overall the game is fairly mediocre. It begins with such promise and then stumbles and falls until the credits roll.",

Such was the case with Bioshock Infinite.  The world immediately grabs you and immerses you in a bold and unforgiving story of betrayal, power seeking, delusions of grandeur, and denial. It's beautiful, and I expect nothing less from Levine, as his writing is always poignant. Where the game takes an odd turn, is the moment you pull out your gun and are forced to start shooting people. There are no real options for avoidance or stealth, it's just a one man (and one woman) murder spree from that point until the end.  The mechanics of shooting are fine, the weapons are interesting though you'll probably pick one or two favorites and stick with them until you run out of ammo. The vigors (their magic system) is also interesting, but again you'll likely pick one or two that works, though I implore you to experiment with combinations, as there are some interesting ones (FLAMING CROWS). That said, there's not a lot of innovation here from the standpoint of what has come before, and why would there be? The market has been flooded with FPS games for the last 10 years.  But it's worth it... Even as you grow tired of shooting people in the face, the story still draws you in. Your partner throughout, the efervescent Elizabeth brings so much character and emotion, as does your own character, Booker Dewitt, that you just can't wait to get to the next scrap of dialogue. It's immersive, and though punctuated by a lot of seemingly needless violence (like, seriously, if Booker had just talked things out with a few of the main 'bad guy' characters, I think they could have worked something out), it's worth playing all the way to the tragic end.",

So my playtime is that of burial at sea episode 1.  Bioshock throws you into a floating world in the sky named Columbia which has great character and atmosphere to it, it's not a scary game but irrational ( the developers ) have created a well realised world and game area for you to enjoy.  There has been a lot of critiscm over the gameplay and although it is not amazing I personally think it is solid and fun especially with sky hooks which allow you to use them as vantage points to hit enemies from and get from point to point.  Elizabeth is a great character full of life and energy and seems innocent and skeptical of you as you see her grow as a character.  The story for me was confuesing at times and the ending I couldn't quite understand which was a disapointment (It's not just me being stupid there are dedicated articles and long professional youtube videos explaining it) however saying that once I knew everything I thought it was sensational and it all made sense. Some of the story in the middle section of the game can be a bit boring to be honest but I still found the game enjoyable enough to continue on despite this.  Overall I think it's an amazing game what irrational planned they have beautifully exucuted with no cutscenes, QTE events as you the player are a part of the game throughout. A superb game.",

My big gripe with this game is the story, that has revcieved such lavishigns of praise. It's certainly above average, yes, however I felt it was pyrotechnical and un-emotional. Personally the connection I felt to the characters was not particulary great, and I feel the merits of the story are more due to it's complication and depth of ideas towards the end, but simply having a complicated story does not mean it is one that is hard hitting. Also, I felt the story had a massive lul between finding Elizibeth and the events near the end.

It's fine. - Plasmids replaced with tonics (and are not responsible for the chaos of the world), you could almost avoid using them. - New enemies, flying around using skylines (and killing things while doing it), occasional custscenes, and a few interesting collectibles really flesh out the game. - You do not need to have played the earlier games to enjoy this one. You would probably enjoy BioShock 2 after playing it, but BioShock 1 might feel like a bit of a downgrade from a gameplay standpoint. - It's not a tough game on normal.

Ambitious in its plot and beautiful in its graphics, Infinite is a game that is simoultaneously fun to play and wonderful to look at. Gameplay and mechanics are very similar to the previous Bioshock games, with the addition of the Skyhook, which opens up a new oppurtunity for diverse tactics. The game is heavily linear, and features a (optional) quest direction indicator line, which holds your hand as you play through the story and keeps on track. Those who are fans of the linear style of Metro Last Light would enjoy this game (however, the aesthetic is the opposite of MLL). The plot combines political and personal intrigue with science-fiction and quantum mechanics in an ambitious and entertaining story that false just short of making sense. At times, the concepts left me wondering what the hell was going on, and distracted from the otherwise enjoyable experience. Ultimately, Bioshock Infinite is a solid game with an interesting, if confusing, plot and gorgeous graphics. If you are looking for a linear experience with familiar FPS gameplay, Bioshock Infinite will not dissapoint.",

Elizabeth is well done. Vigours are a really fun way to off your enemies. Props for the first mainstream Steampunk game.  However, that's kind-of all there is to it. You enter an area, take all the coins and weapons and food, fight some enemies, go to the next area, take the coins and weapons and food, fight some enemies, go to the next area... etc etc.   If they had sandboxed this game it would have been *amazing*. If they had put in crafting, skill trees, all the stuff a game like this needs in 2014, it would have been game of the year. As it is, you're just watching a movie, and occasionally a mob of enemies appear and you have to shoot them. Um...   So 100% for style and presentation, 50% for actual gameplay. So yes, recommended, but with reservations: if you like a linear first-person-shooter where you don't have to think much about puzzles or locations (a big arrow on the floor shows you where to go), then get this, it's beautiful and atmospheric and unique. If you like your games with a bit more.. interaction (Fallout, Deus EX, Dead Island etc) then you may feel a little let down by this.  (To be fair, games like Tomb Raider suffer from the same problem, guess they are written with consoles in mind or something. However, Tomb Raider, for all its restrictions, is practially an open world compared to this)",

            "review_text": "+Summary at End+  So I finally used a weekend to play this after waiting for it to go on sale (caught it at the $15 price) and see what the game was about after all the hype died down, which just took about 4-6 months after release.  The visuals are appealing from a distance, the game uses a cartoon appearance to compensate graphical prowess, something I'd relate to how Warcraft handles it's visuals to keep them from being too dated. The sounds are good, nice and authentic and you don't really tire of hearing or seeing anything.  Visually it's a great game. But that's all I can see it as.  The gameplay is really uninspired. This seems to be what I hear the most complaints about and its true, you're given limited choices in what to improve and you have a large array of weapons and abilities but often you're limited to rock, paper, scissor decision making. Did you bring A with you to fight D? No? Then you'll have a more drawn out battle. Death isn't a factor due to the many checkpoints and revives (when a certain NPC is with you) and the skyhook just felt more like a nuisance than a godsend. I barely used in my playthrough.  Speaking of playthrough, it's a long game, longer than I thought. But in this case it's not a good thing. The game has you back tracking a lot, and if you do the side quests you'll be going through the same areas again and again with respawning enemies. The enemies aren't fun to fight, they quickly begin to be tediuous. Tie in the fact that the only way the game is saved is through checkpoints so you'd better stop playing after a checkpoint or you're going to have to do the whole level again.  So, gameplay could have stood to have a lot of improvement but it's at least decent. If I had to talk about the companion character it's really shallow as well, the game would have been fine without them and their scritped and proximity events (giving items) get old quickly.  Now, on to the elephant in the room, the story. The first part of the game there really isn't much story, all barebones, in fact throughout the game theres barely anything, if you get collectibles it fills in the gap but at face value they really give you the minimum. There's a name to that style that eludes me but given how the gameplay is they've used what they've been given. For all the 'twists and turns' that get thrown at you I found the story to be predictable save one bit at the end that really ended up being a dues ex machina by the writer. During the last few hours (the ending is really really really drawn out and it isn't in a good way in my opinion) I struggled to stay interested, mainly trugging through it because I'd be finished soon and could remove the game from my library. It's much how I felt during most of my playthrough, the parts that were entertaining kept me but those are few and far between. There's just too much filler in this game.  In closing, it's a decent game, good sound and visuals, repetitive and boring combat, and a story that if I had to summarize is really contrived and uninteresting.  In summary: Graphics - Good Sound - Good Gameplay - Boring Story - Bad and Boring  I can't recommend the game.",

            "review_text": "Start playing the game, you're some dude who gets forced up into the cloud city Columbia, where the US founding fathers are worshipped, and the founder of the city is made a prophet. Your mission is to find and retrieve this girl, who is locked in this giant monument house thing. Turns out, she can open and close space time rifts. Things start getting crazy. Going through the campaign is a joy, as well as finding and using all the weapons, powers, rifts, and collectibles. Graphics is a huge plus, as I was literally dumbstruck by the amount of detail that was put into this. Rain seeps through the cracks of the pier, light blooms off of appropriate objects, and the particles of the salt recharge machine are glorious. Gameplay is standard run and gun, but you can use vigors to pull enemies in, float them up, electrocute them, light them up, catch their own bullets and throw them back, and skyrails to move wherever they take you and strike from above. I completed this in 10 hours on normal. 1999 mode, which is extra hard, is added after completing the campaign. The sense of scale is amazing, but it can get you lost at times, even though the game is primarily linear. One more downside to this game is that the ending had me questioning if it was an actual ending, I felt that it took the Borderlands 2 ending route, (people who have played both should know what I mean). By all means, buy it, but I'd wait for a sale, as i feel anywhere from $30 to $10 is a good price for the amount of content alone.",

The game was mechanically sound, if unimaginative, had brilliant graphical and audio design, and kept me in my seat for the full 18 hour playthrough.   One could easily criticize the game for its lack of variety, its near-complete linearity, or the fact that it gets half its guns by slightly tweaking the other half in a 'mirror world' effect. Enemies are too often bullet sponges when shot with weaker guns, yet possess a weak AI that leads them to either charge the player en masse or simply stand still and spray.   Despite the fact that the story fell apart in the third act, I still recommend it as an example of strong storytelling in games. It can also be looked at as a how to on making games with uninteresting mechanics play well because of externals, like audio and visuals.",

BS:I is primarly a shooter with slight RP elements and a compelling story.  what you get: you get around 20 hours of gametime for a playthrough. tho the 'into-part' is quite long. for about 30-60 minutes you only get to explore and investigate until you really get into the action. the game is designed quite linear, so you will kinda direclty follow the plot as the programmers intended. you advance from district to district and unlock areas as you progress in the story. you get the standard collection of shooter weapons like pistol, shotgun, MG, assault rifle, sniper rifle and rocketluncher. like the other bioshock titles, you also get to wield some kind of magic powers, which vary from pure destruction with fire, to controlling and manipulating powers. during the game you will find stronger weapons of a certain kind to keep level with the increasingly powerful enemies. you can upgrade your weapons and magic abilities to become more efficient. you need to put some thinking into that tho, because its unlikely you will be able to unlock all powerups you want to have. all in all you can play your desired style (i.e. closeup shotgunner or sniper or ...) and upgrade accordingly. the grafic is quite nice and the world got its nice wierd 'bioshock touch' as you got it in the other bioshock titles. i found the story to be quite compelling as you reveal one secret after the other about your arch enemy. also the story got some nice twists and if you are the thinking type, then the ending will keep you occupied for quite a while to sort it out properly.  fazit: BS:infinite is a nice shooter with some fantasy aspects (magic) and some minor RP elements (upgrades). the biggest feature is, that BS:I plays with your mind, as it puts you into unusual thinking patterns and paradigms. you get the kind of 'wierd' that made the other bioshock titles stand out.  so, if you like shooters and have a flexibile mind and enjoy to bend your mind, then BS:I is the right thing for you.

The storytelling, central themes, and characters (especially Elizabeth) are all a cut above what most AAA games dare to attempt, and as such this is an important and powerful game in a genre that is traditionally loaded with juvenille pap.   Mild spoilers ahead.  If you're looking for a solid shooter and couldn't give a hoot about a game that attempts to tackle some tough themes, then by all means go and pick up the latest Call of Duty game, however if you're interested in seeing the Video Game Industry actually try to tackle social issues like racism and poverty, or cerebral issues like parallel universes or time loops, then the Bioshock games - and especially Bioshock Infinite - are an amazing place to start.  As far as actual game play goes, Infinite is nothing special - if you've played a previous Bioshock then you know what to expect: your characters spends 50% of his time pouring bullets or psychic powers into waves of generally brainless AI pawns, and 50% of his time scouring through trash cans looking for rotting food to eat, or ammo to restock his arsenal. The shooting is Fine.... but it's not really the point. (And some might argue that there is too much of it, and it gets in the way of the really interesting stuff - namely the story.)  Special mention has to be made of Elizabeth, your 'sidekick' in the game... she joins you a quarter of the wway into the main plot, and if you don't end up fallign in love at least a little bit with her, then you're a cold-hearted person indeed. The game designers clearly wanted the player to emphasize with Elizabeth, and by my estimation they knocked it right out of the park.  All in all, Bioshock Infinite is a 'Must Play' game, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you havent' given it a try yet.",

It's a game that I had fun exploring the intruging world of Columbia, while abusing the hell out of the skyhook to kill monsters. So what made this game really interesting? Let me just critque it..  Graphics: Testing this game out on a 1920 x 1080 setting on Ultra makes this game extremely gorguous to see and feel. I like being introduced to new places, or locations that are easy to get lost in places like the Welcome Center, or Battleship Bay. I really think it's cool to see floating towns in general! Enemies look really detailed ( and Scary )! I'm more tempted to take down a Handyman than a Patriot, since Handymans are scarier in my opinion. Vigors are awesome. Enough Said.  Sound: I love the sound of this game. The Trilogy of Bioshock has never surprised me with their use of vintage music from the early 1900's. I love songs such as ' Will The Circle Be Unbroken ', or the Barbershop Quartet song of 'God Only Knows' too. I recommend it if you're in search of new music. Shots and the use of Vigors sound really accurate. Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper did a suprerb job as Booker and Elizabeth also.  Gameplay: If you played the past Bioshock games, it's almost the same with the exception of Skyhooks. You can now execute enemies which is gruesome to me. Sky executions are also fun to do as well since you can jump back and forth in any direction to go to any rail whenever you want. Elizabeth herself is the best part about combat. She's a very smart person; she can hand you some coins, some ammo/health, and can even open up Tears to assist you. There's so much different ways to approach combat where I want to experiment if a certain combo works ( example: Shock Jockey and Shotgun ). Exploring is self explanatory; you can flesh out the story if you collect Voxophones which give depth to characters in the game if you're ever curious about their motives. You can also have Elizabeth pick lock doors too; it makes exploring more rewarding and can help you upgrades the things you need for your next fight.  Overall: Just get it. You won't be bored because Bioshock Infinite wants you to enjoy every minute of it, and make you wish that such worlds like Columbia exist. The ending can confuse you, but for such a complicated game like this.. it's very well thought out.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the best games i have ever played, I highly recommend that you buy it, i got the whole collection for $20.00 During the holiday sale. The game starts off with the protagonist Booker DeWitt who is in high debt and is sent on a job to wipe it away. Things start to get a little weird very early on when you sit in a chair and it launches you high into the sky, into the beautiful city of Columbia, in which indeed is a floating city. A little early on you will find your best ally Elizebeth who aids you throughout your job, and also just so happen to, be your job. You will later find out that time travel (Also known as tears) will take effect into the game and sometimes forces you to think about what's going on, and, or how Elizebeth creates these tears. You can also see that in the game decisions have created the Protagonist's and Antagonist's life. As they have high similarities yet are completely opposite men. (Spoiler alert) At the end of the game it really leaves you thinking, some people might say, (What the hell was that). You later find out that your job is your daughter who has had her name changed from Anna to Elizebeth after protagonist (Booker DeWitt) has a baptism. This choice makes him into Antagonist (Zachary Comstock) Who is the creator and prophet of the city of Columbia. As you see this choice has completely changed Booker's life. You will also see that coming from the games title Bioshock: Infinite. That the reason it was called infinite was to show that for every choice you make, there will be an infinite amount of outcomes from it. This just goes to show how this game will mindf*ck you. I highly recommend this game and if i were to rate it i would give it a solid 10/10. It has a great ending that leaves you thinking and the gameplay is smooth and fluent with the addition of skylines which intensifies the combat. I beat it at around 9 hours but you might be able to get some more because i rushed a little bit. The game has it's share of difficulty and even brings back mini bosses such as Patriots and Handymen to replace the big daddies in it's predecessors. The game is just really fun and keeps you playing to see how this job plays out for Booker and Elizebeth.",

            "review_text": "Don't play this game for the fight mechanics. I figured I'd just get that statement out of the way before I got into the actual meat of my review. There are a lot of things that Bioshock Infinite is and a lot it's not and whether you'll enjoy it really boils down to assessing what you're actually looking for in a game.  STORY This is the meat and potatoes of this game and it's plenty filling. The world isn't open, but it's easy to get lost exploring little alcoves to find recordings that tell you more and more of the story. It unfolds around you as you make your way through objectives, which are easy to follow thanks to the arrows. I never felt like I didn't know what was going on with the story and even though some characters or events aren't explained right away, they come about in time. My entire first experience was more like participating in a film, rather than playing the game itself. I'd forget to shoot enemies because I was too busy staring at scenery or listening to people talk. The ending blew my mind a little, but then I'm not a philosophical scholar and I'm fairly easily surprised by plot twists even in movies.  GRAPHICS Pretty. So pretty. I don't really think there's a lot of description you need for the graphics, but the world is crafted beautifully. There is some repetition in store fronts and the residents don't have a lot of graphical differences, but you'll be too busy looking around to care that much. Or at least I was. The skies, the buildings, the Songbird, the sky rails, the gondolas - honestly everything is just so pretty.   FIGHTS This is about the only part that I felt was kind of lacking because fights were unimaginative. There were only a couple of instances where I felt like I was challenged, even playing on the highest level. Between chain traps and ammo everywhere and Elizabeth throwing you things, you just kind of blaze through most of the battles. But like I stated from the start - it's not about fight mechanics. They're just in the way of the storytelling.  SUMMARY If you like games with a good plot where you're being entertained more than fighting things, get this game. If you like games with beautiful scenery and surroundings, get this game. Just get this game in general. There's a reason it was such a runaway hit when it came out.",

            "review_text": "I have only played around 7 hours of Bioshock Infinite at this point and not yet completed it, so keep that in mind when reading my review.   First of all I will say that the game is really well drawn and looks beautiful! The soundtrack and the voices are excellent as well and you really feel like you get immersed into the Bioshock world (Columbia). It's also quite exciting and the story is captivating and makes you want to explore it further to discover what is going on. I like the shooting and combat which is pretty classic first-person shooter. Some parts of the gameplay reminds me slightly of Borderlands but of course Bioshock is a completely different animal.   Unfortunately there are also some not so great things about it, mainly being that it's very linear and won't allow you to deviate much from the path that needs to be followed to move the story along. In fact it restricts you way too much in my opinion and you will find many many doors that are locked and can't be opened and places that can't be accessed. One example is when you are on a beach at one point and there are people playing in the water. If you try to run out in the water you will be blocked as if there was a wall of glass in front of you. I don't need it to be a sandbox game, but I definitely would have enjoyed it better if the developer had allowed me to roam a bit more freely and investigate the game world more freely.  Another thing I don't like much is that many of the characters in the game look exactly the same. It would have been nice if everyone looked different, maybe apart from an acutal twin now and then, instead of using generic characters in so many places (NPCs). Likewise you cannot engage with the majority of the characters in the game. You can step up next to them and listen to what they talk about which is a really nice touch which adds lots of ambiance to the game, but you cannot talk to them or interact with them for the most part. I would have liked to be able to do that to some degree.   All in all I will definitely recommend the game because it is actually really good entertainment and it's definitely one of the best looking games I have played.   Hope this review helped and if I change my mind after finishing the game I will update the review accordingly :-)  Have fun!",

I've played most of the Bioshock games up until now, beat a lot of Big Daddies and saved a bunch of little sisters in the way, but I must say that I never had such a strong bounding with the characters, that changed in Infinite.   Elizabeth reminds me of Alyx Vance, the female companion that helps you fight the Combine in Half-Life 2, the game and how the character reacts to the things you acomplish makes them almost human, therefore making you care for them, and not see them as simple 3D models designed to help you out. Even though the graphics aren't the best ones out there, they're pretty beautiful to look at, and some models can even catch your attention, making you spend a little time just walking around them and cheking them out, the plot is also interesting, most of the mysteries will keep you interested until the end of it.  Unfortunately not everything is perfect, the game uses the Unreal Engine 3, an engine known for being not very demanding, but still, Bioshock Infinite is a very demanding game, I have a machine with the recommeded requirements, but still there were times when the game would freeze for some seconds after going back to normal. It also suffers from something that has affected most of the games being released nowadays: simplification and casualization.  I'd still recommed the game to anyone who played the previous ones, as it has a good plot and a bunch of things to collect, just make sure your PC can handle it.",

The characters are fairly standard in terms of personality and even the backdrops are concepts oft visited before. But the way that the entire tapestry is woven together is what helps this game to prove that cliches and archetypes can still be powerful things in the hands of a good storyteller.  At first, playing with Bioshock in mind, I felt myself stangely uncompelled by what was occurring in the story, but I continued on. I later found myself being swept up in everything that was occurring, all leading up to the tumultous climax which ends, suddenly, with a startling conclusion.  The game is gorgeous, the combat and interaction engaging, and the stylistic concepts a delight for anyone who enjoys steampunk design or noir storytelling. Tapping modern philosophy and science and age-old social issues, this game is sure to provide much post game thought experiments and quandaries to puzzle through.",

Once again, the vending machines, enemy unit catch phrases and ravings of an arrogant leader make for a wildly entertaining ride of a game. I found myself talking like the health dispensing machine on a regualr basis before finishing....  As for the gameplay, the skyhook is fantastic fun although I never once had to fight an enemy who was riding the same one I did (played through on hard once). Also I got through the game in about 7 hours seriously only comboing vigors on three separate occasions, and only using Shock Jockey, Crows and Possession. I would have rather seen this aspect as more of a requirement to kill type-specific bosses or large diverse groups of enemies to really up the difficulty.   The scenes exploring the Elizabeth character and her role in the 'big picture' really drive this title home as one of my favorite games ever digested.

A good sequel uses the original as a jumping off point to an entirely unique experience.  You start out as this dude named Booker, and you go to the cloud city of Columbia. You get some plasmids, sorry, I meant vigors, and you have to rescue some gild who follows you around for the rest of the game.  Now about this girl. From a gameplay perspective, it's amazing to play a game where you don't want to bash the face in of whatever NPC you are escorting. Normaly, excort quests are rubbish. However this game is a joyful exception to that rule. The girl never gets in your way, and she doesn't get herself killed in combat. In fact, she's incredibly helpful in combat because she will sometimes 'find' health and ammo if you are running low.  Another bit of gameplay that was added that I find awesome is the sky-rails. You know in Bioshock how there was never a single bit of actual underwater gameplay, in a city that is entirely underwater? Yeah, they fix that here. the skyrails are awesome.  Also the plot is great and these developers seem to have mastered the video game plot reveal. The last 30 minutes of the game is pure brilliance.  This is easily the best game I played in 2013. I've been sitting here for at least 10 minutes trying to think of any complaints I might have, so this review is a little more balanced, and I'm have a very hard time remembering any.",

Bioshock 1 didn't make the mistake of focusing the game on the story, the story was just a very good addition to the solid gameplay. Infinite decides to focus more on its story, and the gameplay falls behind previous games in the series. Plasmids aren't varied (to the point of being reskins of each other), and the survival-horror style of gameplay in the original Bioshock is completely stripped from this game in favour of generic 'shoot lots at bullet sponges'.  There's nothing special about the gameplay of this game. There's the occasional excuse of a puzzle a 4 year old could solve, the combat is generic and there's none of the appealing elements from earlier instalments of the series. So we'll forget about that and look at what the game sells itself on; story and characters. Rather than focusing on key points, it kind of just wanders over an array of ideas without delving into any of them. At times the story is just completely stupid. For example, a group of rebels who look up to you unexplainable try to kill you without a second thought. This is without even mentioning the exposition of the game, but I'll get to that later. The characters aren't nearly as bad as the story, but they're not very 3 dimensional either. Elizabeth is obviously THE selling point of the game and she's quite likable, and they obviously spent a lot of time making her seem less like a typical NPC. However, she doesn't seem to stand by her ideas. She has a go at you for killing someone early on in the game, then proceeds to watch you murder 100's of others without even so much as a frown. Well, it might have gotten annoying if she kept nagging at you. The rest of the cast are really forgettable, or completely misused. Songbird comes to mind here. What a great boss this could have been, but instead it's just used as a plot device, again as an ally in a terrible fight, and then disposed of. A complete waste of an otherwise interesting design. The Twins were the only other memorable characters due to their quirky and entertaining behaviour.   Okay, the ending. It was stupid, pretentious, and pointless. Yes, if you actually understand the nonsense they dump on you at the end, then you will see how pointless it is. Warning, SPOILERS AHEAD. If there are an infinite number of worlds, then Booker has (according to the story) to die in all of them. This simply wouldn’t happen, there will be at least one reality where booker doesn't die, and therefore the supposed reason behind your death is completely void.   Buy it on sale if you wish, but if you were a fan of the original expect to be disappointed. The other reviewers who are praising the writing and story probably haven't read a book in their lifetimes.",

The characters are also fun to listen to and learn about and will make you want to collect every Voxophone to listen to different points of view and stories. The only thing I was kind of dissapointed in was a lack of multiplayer.

            "review_text": "Some say this is the game of the year, others say the best game of all time. I just say that this game had a lot of potential to be a lot better.   Firstly, in this game the story is a big deal, since there are plot twists, a lot of mystery around the main characters, which is the main driving factor to continue through the game. The way the story is presented will leave you with many questions as the game progresses, but does not answer all of them. The best experience would probably be the 2nd run, because there are so many little story hints and details scattered everywhere, that you will not have any idea what to link to on your 1st run. Either way, if you do not get attached to the story you may not mind the unanswered questions, gaps, and out of place fantasy elements the story has.  Secondly, the gameplay is between fun, frustrating and repetitive. The frustration could be completely eliminated by either letting you carry more ammo, or 3 guns instead of 2. It is repetitive when you face enemies doorway after doorway, and you mostly use the same tactic to defeat them. Also a bit in the repetitive side, is the need to loot in order to obtain ammo, money, and upgrades. There are many rooms and sections from where you can loot, if you are the type of person that do not like to miss an upgrade, you will spend half of the game scavenging.   Thirdly, Elizabeth. If you have seen trailers from like 2 years ago, you will be disappointed. You are probably expecting a character that can interact with you dynamically and in interesting ways. But what you get here is an AI that follows you around, makes some meaningless comments about random objects in the background, and throws you objects when you need them. It is just the same as any other game, no breakthroughs here.  Last, but not least. The graphics and art. Well, this game is very good in this aspect. A lot of detail and beautiful landscapes. For me it does not make up for the cons, but well, if you take this away you may not even consider this a good game anymore.  There are some other annoyances like being presented with choices that do not affect the game at all, constantly facing racism, high class vs low class and religion brainwashing speeches, but they are tied to the story and to the context Ken Levine wanted to create for his game about Quantum Physics.  In summary, Quantum Physics + Attempt to create charismatic companion + Random Context + Great Graphics and Art = Bioshock Infinite",

Leaving the world of Rapture behind, a new protagonist now finds himself in the city of Columbia, a massive floating city comprised of god knows how many floating island.  Columbia itself is an extreme version of an incredibly patriotic American city in the early 20th century, filled with religious zealots, bigoted as you could imagine. These people worship the founding fathers as Gods and following a prophet named Father Comstock.  The gameplay has vastly improved over the other two BioShock games (ie. shooting mechanics, controls, etc.) and introducing several new features, one of the most notable being sky rails.  It feels very familiar in terms of the attempt at an isolated utopia and the way the story unravels, however it establishes itself as its own game early on and sets itself apart in many ways from the first two games.  I won't give any more away, but I can seriously, seriously recommend playing the game. To get the full experience out of it, I would recommend playing the first game. Many parallels can be drawn and it's exciting to see the way a city with essentially the exact opposite ideals to Rapture manages.",

Every aspect of the game is drenched in commentary, character development, and the type of thematic challenges one expects from only the very best 'hard' science fiction. There's more to ponder and enjoy in a single nook of one level than has been served up in the entire Call of Duty series.

The story is a masterful weave that helps pull one through even after the endless FPS sequences start to ware.

Elizabeth proves everybit as good a companion as one could hope for in this generations AI and it's hard not to care for her and Booker 'the protaganist' personal tale. As with the original its does not hold back on intellectual ideals and theories that leave much for the gamer to think about long after the final curtain.

The colour schemes used, the characters you interact with. Everything was done with purpose and expertise unseen today in any rival video game.  The Story, While at times confusing will leave you totaly enthralled. You wil not be dissapointed (though maybe confused at first). But where the story itself might leave you guessing, The gameplay itself will leave you totally satisfied.  Hi paced acrobatic gameplay that will never give you a dull moment. I often found myself reloading from previous saved games, just to replay a battle over and over again for it's excitment  a 9.99/10.

            "review_text": "The story of Bioshock Infinite deserves all of the praise it gets. It's presented in a way that doesn't overly confuse the player and when it hits, it hits hard. It tells a tale that mixes elements of both fantasy and science fiction that hasn't really been done in this fashion before. The art direction is stunning and you get a real feeling of place in the world, thanks to the smaller details and liveliness of your surrondings. The soundtrack swells during emotional moments, helping to drive home the fact that the story is not only a mentally stimulating one, but one that can still manage to pull at your heart strings from time to time. It boils into a loud, bombastic clash of strings and percussion instruments that is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubriks 'The Shining'. The major fault of this game is that if your looking for a game with strong gameplay, enough so that it can carry you through it on its own, you might be dissapointed. The gameplay lacks any kind of depth or complexity and while this is probably done to give the player's mind a rest after the more logically complex moments of the story present themselves, it is still only a mindless shooter with gimmicky, if fun, elements tossed into the mix. The skyhooks and elizabeth's tear powers do add complexity, but little do they help to make the player think in battle. The vigors are much less a carefully chosen set of skills the player has with them to deal with specific tasks, as much as they are general use and really used as either stuns, Area of Effect, or damage utilities. While this may sound bad, believe me when I say that Bioshock Infinite is truly a marvelous experience, worth the money and time, just not as good of a game. Certainly better gameplay than Call of Duty, but the quality of the game itself does not stack up to the quality set forth by the rest of the package. I'd reccomend this to anyone looking for a deep and involving story, but not to someone looking for a deep and involving game.",

The action is pretty run and gun, and will have you dodging rockets, jumping onto sky rails, and using crazy magical like powers. The thing that will keep you playing however, is wanting to know what happens next in the story, and where they could possibly take the plot. Top notch voice acting and script!",

            "review_text": "'Ascension. 10,000. 15,000... hallelujah.' This game is absolutely phenomenal in many aspects which define both a memorable story line, gameplay, and visuals. Set in an alternate 1912, you play as Booker DeWitt on a rescue mission to save a girl captive in a city floating in the sky. During the first 5 minutes of the game, the remarkable intro to the vast sky city of Columbia will leave you in awe and welcome you to plenty more stunning scenes to come.   The visual experience is absolutley fantastic. When i play games, i often find myself taking a few screenshots here and there whenever i find the need to, either for a desktop wallpaper or to just show friends. When playing this game, i found myself taking screenshots of EVERYTHING. Every corner, every moment, and every object is a detailed work of art, ranging from breathtaking views of the city, a day at the beach, statues of prophets, specific tonality for every room, or something as a small as a vase or a street lamp. These visual achievements successfully portray a unique time period and deliver something unique and probably something never before seen in a game (during my experiences), all of which works beautifully to present the historical setting of Infinite.   The gameplay mechanics are fun, satisfactory, and exciting. The combination of the new Sky hook and traditional weapons allows for extremely fun and fast paced gunplay. It is a balanced system with challenging boss battles and AI. Whether it's jumping from skyline to skyline, using vigor abilites for protection or manipulating an enemy, or using your Sky hook to land a brutal melee, Infinite delivers a gameplay experience that's familiar to previous Bioshock games and greatly improves on it, leaving the player satisfied and wanting several more play-throughs.  I enjoyed everything this game had to offer. From its stunning visuals, to its memorable story/setting, fantastic musical score, and fun and satisfying gameplay mechanics. I recommend this game to both hardcore and casual gamers, for it has something to offer for both. Take your time with this game, and Enjoy!  AN EASY 5/5 :)",

            "review_text": "Gameplay: The gamplay is very similar to Bioshock 2 with the ability to dual wield a vigor (plasmid) and a gun. The shooting mechanics are rock solid as to be expected from this developer. The only real new addition to gameplay is the inclusion of the skyrails which you can use to ride on in gunfights to enhance mobility and shoot from. While not much new was added the gameplay is still rock solid and fun. Even more fun to the shooting segments are segments where we are allowed to take a breath and explore and interact with the world. These moments are done masterfully and should be savored as long as possible.  Visual Design: The visuals of this game are absolutely breathttaking. This is a game that realized excellent art direction is more important than graphical capability and manages to combine both with exceptional skill. The game is gorgeous and fantastically detailed. The game bids farewell to the browns and grays so prevalent in modern shooters and replaces them with a world seeping in beautiful well matched colors. The opening will leave you convinced.  Sound: The sound is top notch along with the excellent music choices. The creators cleverly inserted several musical easter eggs well worth finding throuhout a playthrough.  Story: If there is one reason you should pick up this game this is it. The story is fantastically written with an ending that will keep you up at night and that you will never ever forget. Few games can claim such lofty achievments when it comes to story. The story is very much a love letter classic early 1900's science fiction and blending it with the newer more complex ideas of more modern science fiction. The ending manages to turn the story upsidedown at the end making a replay guaranteed almost immediatley after first completion. The world of Columbia is an excellent satire of American nationalism taken to extremes with a focus on American Exceptionalism. The satire is handled masterfully and intelligently just as it was in the original Bioshock. The world manages to look beatiful and reveal itself to be ugly through intelligent writing. This is a high point for writing in games.  Replayablity: The story is the primary reason to replay the game. Sure there are plenty of collectables you likely missed while playing through the game but the true reason you will boot it back up again 5 minutes after finishing the story is to see the story play out fully knowing and understanding the twist. This is a rare game where the second play through is equally as fun a second time through as the first. Finding all the subltle and not so subtle hints that flew over your head the first time you played is a very rewarding experience that makes this game special in its own way.    Recommendation: I fully recommend this game. The only weakness I found was the gamplay changing so little since bioshock 2 but that is a solid system to stand on (and the only thing good about bioshock 2). If you love stories and fantastic beautiful worlds to explore this game is a must own. A Full Recomendation!  Tip for first time players: Play through the game at a slow pace and immerse yourself in the world. There are several non combat segments that you should take your time with. Rushing through the game can lessen the impact of the ending so take a breath take a walk and play a carnival game or two.",

You run out of salts too quickly and none are really useful enough to even be worth using. So then the combat becomes shooting people with generic guns. There were many times when I wanted to enjoy the game so much that I almost did, but in reality, I was despising every moment and even getting a little bored. Luckily this didn't happen often enough to make this a bad game.

I mean, it's still a first person shooter with the main goal of committing GHRV against the virtual monsters in the game.

I know video games, almost as a rule, do this but I couldn't help but wonder if it needed the ending to be the way it was in order to finish the story. Ultimately the ending let me down.

Player training is an issue in that once you find a new vigor, there is little incentive to explore its use and purpose.  The narrative runs into many plot holes in that you are never given a genuine reason for the denizens of Colombia to come after you until Fink identifies you as the 'False Shepard'. This happens again later when the Vox are treating you like the second coming, then Fitroy disclaims you and then EVERYONE is after you. The ending is very memorable, on par with Portal's ending.   In the end, the game is not as good as it's initial reviews, but doesn't quite deserve the backlash it seems to be getting in online forums.

In the first two Bioshock games, Plasmids were key to survival, but in Infinite, you can all but never use them except to progress the plot as needed. That being said, the game was gorgeous, had a fantastic soundtrack, and played like a dream. I'm absolutely certain that Bioshock 1 was the best game of the series, followed closely by Infinite. It's great, but they didn't really reinvent the wheel here, they just cleaned it up and made it a lot more presentable. Rapture or Columbia? Rapture. Plasmids or Vigors? Plasmids. Great game? Absolutely. Better than the original? ...Meh. I'll leave that up to history to decide. Bioshock Infinite: The most beautiful game you'll ever play, chock full of amazing weapons and completely ignorable powers. 'Evolve today!' ...No, wait, that's the original Bioshock.

The only possible negatives I can mention are the fact that, unlike the previous games, you can only carry 2 guns at a time which limits your combat choices and there are the occasional oddities like NPCs disappearing or the inability to interact with them, instead just listening in on conversations.

            "review_text": "INTRO  Burial at Sea is the first part of Bioshock Infinites DLC series and has you playing as Booker Dewitt back down below in Rapture (nostalgia trip). The DLC begins with a young woman requesting you investigate in the case of missing young girl. After a brief conversation the young woman is revealed to be Elizabeth from Infinite’s storyline.  GAMEPLAY  The gameplay hasn’t changed much from the main game so there’s not a lot to talk about really, but there have been a few minor changes to the difficulty that enhance the experience and give you the horror nostalgia trip back to the first Bioshock. First off, ammo is scarce, at first it may seem quite a cheap choice to create difficulty but once you get into it you find yourself using your plastids (yes plastids – IMPORTANT) more than you would have in Infinite. I’m unsure about anyone else but in Infinite’s storyline I found myself using Vigours/Plastids to enhance my gun play (Bucking Bronco TO shotgun) rather than using them for their own powers. Next we have the weapon wheel, YES it’s back! Yay! Unfortunately you are still restricted to two weapons at once as using the weapon wheel will only switch out the weapon you are holding but it’s still infinitely (no pun intended) better than Infinite’s system. Although not every gameplay aspect has been reviewed, unfortunately the stealth gameplay still suffers from serious bugs or just flat out not working at all.    //  *SPOILER WARNING*  //    STORY  Now, as was the same with Infinite (I felt anyway) the gameplay was the basic rather mundane aspect of the game as I found the gameplay sections boring and simple gateways between the storyline. Once again this is the case. The story is still phenomenal with an awesome ending that leaves us with a cliff-hanger but not SO much that it seems annoying. Without spoiling any surprises the story finishes as you would expect, if you pay attention to what Elizabeth is saying throughout the DLC (and if you actually played Infinite), with a huge reveal and explanation simultaneously, leading into what the next DLC will play as. BUT, as epic as the story was I feel it had some issues. The storyline in DLC (I find) tends to be SIDE stories or what COULD have happened, but this doesn’t feel like that, this feels like it’s actually part of the main story as it is continuing that story. I am firmly against an extension to a storyline that we already paid for; this DLC opened up what we knew would happen and is asking for more money – bad developers. BAD. Also, another bad developer move, why did you give a blurb for episode two? The blurb for episode 2 gives SERIOUS hints of the ending of this DLC.  CONCLUSION  While I agree that the original storyline shouldn’t be continued in paid DLC or not, I can’t deny how epic this DLC was. Again, I personally feel the gameplay sections in Infinite and it’s DLC were simple filler sections to get me back into the epic story, but I would defiantly say the gameplay sections were less mundane than that of Infinite (maybe nostalgia me talking but hey). So here it is, the killer question; is it worth it? No. I wouldn’t say so, it’s fun and all, but if you can get the same experience watching someone play a game, then it’s not worth it in my opinion. Like I said the gameplay sections still felt like filler so simply watching the cut scenes/conversations over someone’s shoulder would be enough to get what was great about this – the story. Whenever I’m thinking about buying DLC I look back at some of my all the time favourite – Dragonborn. Lots to do, new items, NOT a continued story but a side story and a great side story as well. Now considering you can get Dragonborn for two pounds more, you wouldn’t expect such a HUGE difference in quality – but unfortunately there is.",

Though, the combat separately is still great, but it could be delivered better if it was hypothetically a different genre, along with some mechanics that could be polished more. Overall, there is some wasted potential when meshing the two together, which leaves the player with some slightly shafted experience of the game.

The city of Columbia is amazing, your companion Elizabeth even moreso. Infinite takes a few oft-tried but seldom mastered gimmicks of video games (an AI-controlled companion, learning-by-dying, attempts to connect emotionally with the player) and twists them around. While Infinite has certainly compromised on some areas (advanced or deep combat most notably) to advance in others, it strikes a great balance. I was invested in Elizabeth, I felt concern for Booker and was amused by the simple twists on dying in the game that I didn't feel the rather rudimentary combat was something to complain about.

The plot kept me engaged the entire time, and while certain areas did feel like filler (specifically right before the final act) the small plot twists and interesting premise, along with the great characterization, will keep you playing.  Atmosphere: 10/10 Columbia (the city the game takes place in) is beautiful, and the variation between different zones is beautiful. A screenshot from anywhere in game looks like a painting. The music is fitting, the city feels alive, and while you don't always feel like you are miles off the ground, you always feel like you are in Columbia.  Gameplay: 8/10 Solid shooter mechanics, and a variety of weapons. The new plasmids, err tonics, are different enough to compliment a variety of play styles. The action is fast paced and very much -in your face-, so don't expect stealth mechanics, but the gun-play is much improved from the original Bioshock. The limit of two weapons at a time is also a welcomed addition, as it makes you wonder if carrying around an RPG for a boss is worth it when fighting individual units.   Sound: 9/10 The voice acting is fantastic, and while the music is up to par with industry standards, doesn't really stand out all too much. There is only one point at which soundtrack really stood out to me, but even then it was only for a moment. For the most part the soundtrack is going ot be fast paced to match the gameplay, which works. Columbia, however, and the sounds of the machines and songs on the streets, work perfectly.   Pros: Great Story and Atmosphere Solid Mechanics and Gameplay Continues the BioShock story Amazing Characterization  Cons: Certain areas feel like filler Strange difficulty spikes in some areas Low-Medium Replayability Some tonics you get too late into the game  Extra Notes: Looking forward to see where they go with DLC. There are some characters I'd like to see expanded (Songbird).",

            "review_text": "Bioshock Infinite, experience out the ♥♥♥.  Really though, between the absolutely gorgeous set pieces and badly timed exposition, this game is everything I had hoped for. It's somewhat of a first person adventure game, that focuses on shooting as much as picking apples to eat out of trash cans. Considering that I actually hadn't play Bioshock prior to this, I felt nothing but appreciation for the artistic vision being put forward here. While hating this game now seems to be some kind of farce, with its glitters worn off more than half a year after its release, I cannot help but love it. Before any of you on the hate bandwagon point at me and say I'm just trying to defend my purchase, I did not even buy this game. It was gifted to me by a friend, and I suppose I owe him something, right?  Nah.  In this game, you play as Booker DeWitt, a drunken gambler who happened to, avoiding spoilers, lost something rather close to him. Arriving at a light house (a throw back that is now that I know) after being lead onto by a pair resembling a cross between mad scientists and aliens from E.T, you are exposed to this glorious floating golden set of concrete on cloud named Columbia. It was at this point that the game was starting to destroy my frame rates, but not by too much that would become noticeable. Anyway, you are exposed to this gorgeous intact world of what seemed to be paradise where everyone's really racist. Then again it is the early 1900s so what else can I expect from Americans? Anyways, you are participating in this annual fair for some reasons while kept on getting visually ♥♥♥♥ed by all the shiny and crazies of this gorgeous engine. Suddenly, everything turned all gory and fast paced, after a bearded Catholic (hej) priest told everyone that you're going to destroy their paradise and murder their people, thus you must escape by destroying their paradise and murdering their people.   Underlying all of this is the plot of where you must find this girl and repay a debt you apparently had. After countless hours of massacre and relentless shooting gallery, you are met with Elizabeth, the centerpiece of the story. While I had my own gripes about Booker being on the cover of the sodding box art while Elizabeth was clearly the actual star of the game, or how she had dissolved from a magic-wielding witch whose capable of destruction far surpasses that of comprehension to a girl who occasionally throw you supplies she pulled out of her backside, at least the game isn't a giant escort mission. Elizabeth is a helpful and healthy part of gameplay that blends in rather well with the rest of the world created. Your journey proceeds to an adventure, where your choice dictates the fate you choose for this girl and how the world reacts to it, creating a very dynamic experience that is unique to every player.  Psyche.  No, you're not going to have that. What you ARE going to get though is an admittedly clunky combat system that is somehow weaker than its prequel, and interface so clunky and obviously shoehorned for console that it irks me so much that the 'gameplay' aspect of Bioshock Infinite felt quite a bit tacked on. There's a certain amount of collectibles and exploration to be done in this game, and that is good, but it's still rather linear. I'm not going to go any deeper to this, however, as it would spoil the plot rather heftily. What you do need to know, however, is that you would either come out of the game feeling cheated out of a good ending that actually is coherent and not terribly pretentious, or feel like you've gone through the best 10 hours moral class of your life and now are feeling empty inside.

I liked BioShock Infinite's story. I did not like its gameplay, or its mood, or its atmosphere.  Gameplay was, well, dull. Just a boring wave-based shootybang. The lack of horror or more close-quartered based combat of BioShock 1 was sorely missed, the weapons were kinda dull, and the Vigors weren't half as interesting as the Plasmids from the first game. Plus they're just there, generally accepted, and don't feel as pivotal to the plot. That's disappointing, all things considered. The only reason I played through to the finish is because if I stopped, I don't think I would've carried on.  Its mood was... eh. This harks back to gameplay. It just felt too frantic, which is kind of bland because that's pretty much every single-player shooter these days. *snore* The game just never did much to really make me feel much other than on my toes in a ridiculous firefight, or ignoring the environment to scavenge ammo and money so I could prepare myself for the next bland and unineteresting encounter. I didn't *feel* anything playing this game.  Atmosphere. Hmm. This is where the game fails. Pretty much every area of BioShock felt real; Infinite felt fake and forced. I never felt interested in Columbia once, and the game did nothing to change that. I want to spoil the ending, but there's a bit in the end that elicited the feeling of the first game very much so, and it was pretty much that point that I realised what I'd been missing all throughout Infinite.  And sure, the game covers topics of poverty, racism, religious persecution, American exceptionalism, blahblahblah. But all of these felt like a fart in the wind, and were grossly overblown in the game's promotion. Infinite, whilst relatively bold for a shooter, is pretty tame by most standards.  But boy, did it have interesting characters. And that ending made the whole thing just about worth it. Just about.  The whole package isn't bad, and if you're happy to just shoot dudes then you'll be content, but I feel that stopped the game from being something great, which is what we were promised in 2K's PR avalanche of trailers, making of/behind the scenes YouTube videos, and IGN's hyperbolic exclusive early review.  All told, I won't be playing BioShock Infinite again, which I can't say is the case for the first one. That's a game I'll be going back to many more times to come. Infinite will be consigned to the dustbin of history once this wretched era of the shootybang dudebro videogame monoculture is finally over.  7/10",

The history is good, as you would expect from a Bioshock series. However, the background history is very confusing in the start and you must keep progressing the game hoping to get any kind of explanation. Columbia is a utopic city like Rapture once was, but this time you arrive during the 'good days'. The game never ever explained how vigors exists and why nobody is interested in them (since almost no one uses or mention vigors). Well, despite that, the game goes on telling you bits of the lore during your play, until you finish it and almost every puzzle piece come to it's place.  The gameplay is fantastic with Elizabeth, I just wish that Vigors were more available in the beggining, I used to play Bioshock 1 and 2 with almost Plasmids only. In this game you're gonna rely a LOT more in your guns, which I didn't like.  If you ever played any Bioshock series, play this game on Hard. The game is not that hard and I suppose that on normal it would be much more stompable.",

Also, that previously mentioned poor combat? Yeah, riding on skylines. It helps the setting and gives a bit more needed variety to gunplay.

My main gripe however, is how the actual gameplay (you know, that one thing that you generally buy video games for) is repetitive and unoriginal. The combat system is nearly identical to that of the previous 2 bioshocks with some small changes:  1) More weapons. The downside to this is that while you had original, interesting weapons in the original bioshock with varied ammunition, most of the weapons in infinite feel indistinguishable from one another 2) Removal of hackable turrets and security bots. In the previous games, you could take splicers, security bots, and big daddy's and play them off of each other to make for very interesting combat. 3) Introduction of tears. Elizabeth's powers, while interesting, basically consist of summoning cover, grapple points, or weapons into being. While a nice addition, this doesn't make the combat much more engaging. Elizabeth does have the ability to throw you ammunition and health which is nice, but doesn't add much to gameplay. 4) Introduction of skylines. This is the main mechanic that mixes up the combat. The ability to zoom through the sky while eliminating enemies is exhilarating. However, this feeling quickly fades when you realize that you never HAVE to use them to win a particular fight. It's a strange sensation how you have to essentially make your own fun rather than have the game simply BE fun.  In the first Bioshock game, you had a significant variety of weapons, traps, and plasmids to make the game interesting no matter what and each individual component had a specific purpose. In Infinite, it feels like different weapons and abilities are included just for the sake of being in the game. Is this a must buy game? No, not at full price at least (I picked mine up from an Amazon sale for under $20). Instead, I recommend picking it up once you've cleared out part of your backlog or if you're specifically looking for an interesting story, just don't expect anything utterly ground breaking in terms of gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Bioshock Infinite is the third installment in the Bioshock Series. Story-wise, this has little to no connection with the first two - being set in the world of Columbia (a flying city) instead of Rapture (the underwater city in the first two games).   There are mixed reviews about this game (mostly highly recommended but there are a few who dislike this game). I'm in the middle of the road. Let's start with the negatives because I have a bias on loving everything bioshock.  Cons FPS mechanics somewhat forces the player to play Infinite like a common shooter  - Headshot is properly implemented this game - and with that, there is little to no benefit in using Vigors (this game's version of Plasmids/Magic).   - It's extremely quicker to just shoot them in the head with a sniper than bother doing gun+vigor combos unlike in the first two games. Because of this, I ran the rest of the game with the first sniper rifle handed to me (a few minutes into the game) Vigors are now more of just 'distractions'.  Protagonist now has a shield. Shield is very OP - Shields soak up damage before going to direct damage. This regenerates automatically over time (when not taking damage). The cooldown time is relatively short, making shields very overpowered for a good part of the game. - Shields, though not customizable, are upgradeable due to special 'drinks' called infusions (you can choose between increased Health / Shields / Mana. Fully upgraded, it becomes equal to the starting Health.  Changes in theme / narrative  - I really loved the Rapture experience from the first two games (actually the first one was the best). It was the combination of lonely, creepy, desperate and insane in some ways. Bioshock Infinite took what worked in the first two games and turned it around and took a new path. Columbia is very bright and very spacious (given the floating city setting), but even the indoor environments are bigger (to give way to the sky-line system). The theme now revolves on religion, politics, and racism which is, for me, was not as gripping as a theme compared to what the first one had.  Pros Game implementation/optimization in general  - I played all Bioshock games in my laptop, and this was the first one to 'not crash' during gameplay. It was also weird that this is less / equally taxing to my laptop as compared to the second game. Kudos to the game optimization team  New Skyline system  - the Skyline is a form of transportation in this game. It is the rails that hold the cable cars/gondolas around the floating sections of columbia. It adds a new dimension to combat because you can shoot enemies and perform dive-attacks from the line, and it also gives you a new way of going around the combat area (though you are very vulnerable to enemy fire if you choose the lower speeds)  Implements a 'breadcrumbs'-style of navigation  - they took out the map - a minor Con(s) - and replaced it with a breadcrumbs-style navigation system. You press a button and an arrow juts out from your position on the floor, pointing to the objective.   - Backtracking is harder, but my rule of thumb is, whereever the arrow points, you go to the other way to get the goodies, then follow the arrow.  New equipment system  - The protagonist now has 4 slots for equipment (hat, chest, pants, boots) which give out different kinds of bonuses / abilities. My character has a hat that gives him a chance to set enemies on fire when hitting them with a melee attack.   Long story short, I loved the new improvements, but terribly miss the old setting.   Again, this is a must buy if you liked the first two, but other than that, it's just your average first-person-shooter with a few nifty bells and whistles and offers little enjoyment if you don't like the Bioshock story in the first place.",

It expects that you know how to play a FPS, and streamlines through the easy details. Combat is progressive and becomes more difficult through time (as it should, but there has been a lack of that in the gaming industry lately). Plot, plot, and more plot is the biggest pro, although the beginning may drag a little. The artistry is life-changing, and with a high-level graphics card it will shine (not literally). Character customization also had a small presence but was still there with mostly a perk-based system.  Cons: The game feels cut short and you want more at the very end, which is bad for me but maybe not for others. The guns became a little bleak at the end because you use the same guns throughout the whole game. It also was constantly wanting me to use a shotgun or an RPG, which is not my style at all. As the game progressively became harder, it was partly because enemies just came in thicker waves. There were some legitamate jumps in enemy difficulty, though, just not that many. Also, don't believe the arrow that points you toward your next objective. Most of the time it is accurate, but it glitched twice on me while going through the game. This forced me to waste probably 20 minutes total of gameplay because I became completely flipped backwards.   Overall: Between the arrow malfucntion and the time I spent with the game idled so I could do other things quickly (the game works on an autosave system), I added probably 2 and a half hours to my total play time. So the game came in somewhere between 8 and 9 hours (this can definitely vary depending on the type of gamer). It may be short, but BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT.

            "review_text": "Beauty and Brutality go Head to Head in BioShock Infinite    It’s always special when you get to witness something that in some way shapes the future of the gaming industry. BioShock Infinite does just that. It brings new life to a genre that many believe has gotten stale. It also reminds us that single player first person shooters are still able to tell good stories. With all of its components working together, Infinite becomes what is arguably the best game in the BioShock series.  The first few moments of Infinite mirror those of the original BioShock. You, Booker DeWitt, are given one simple goal - “Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt”. DeWitt travels to a lighthouse and is soon blasted past the clouds into Colombia, a floating city. Seriously. The moment I laid eyes on Colombia, my jaw dropped. It is truly a sight to behold.   Of course when you actually do get the girl, the plot is complicated and what started out as a “save the princess from the castle” storyline becomes something bolder than what the average video game is willing to tell. The less you know the better. The ending is slightly confusing but the game as a whole is open to interpretation. It’s a great discussion topic and the story is one of Infinite’s greatest successes.   However, every great story requires great characters. BioShock Infinite does not stumble here. The “princess” that you have to rescue is Elizabeth, although she doesn’t stay that way for long. Her character arch is one of the stories main components. It’s interesting to see a once innocent girl become hardened by tragedy and violence. It’s made even better due to the fact that Elizabeth is so damn likeable. Courtnee Draper delivers a wonderful performance as Elizabeth, giving her an extremely charming personality. Troy Baker is also strong as Booker DeWitt. His character is also tragic and it’s interesting to discover more about his past.  But BioShock Infinite’s greatest character is actually the floating city of Colombia. Set in 1912, Colombia has a relaxing and steampunk feel to it when the game begins. Everyone is happy and the world is absolutely gorgeous. However, Colombia is not at all how it first seems. As the story progresses, Colombia is revealed to be a city of white supremacists and extreme nationalists - people who subject interracial couples to public stonings and force African Americans and Irish Immigrants to work 16 hour days in terrible conditions. And on the other side is the Vox Populi, essentially a more extreme version of the Black Panthers. It’s all a bit too realistic and is frightening to witness. To make matters worse, you are looked at as the “False Shepherd” (Colombia’s version of the anti-christ). Everybody wants to kill you and bring Elizabeth back into captivity. What results is some brutal violence that contrasts beautifully with the environments.  Fortunately, Infinite’s gameplay is as good as its story. As in the first BioShock, the shooting is complemented by Vigors (renamed Plasmids). These range from fire grenades, a hoard of crows that will peck away at enemies, a wave of water that will send enemies flying backwards, and a lot more. You also possess a skyhook, which you can use to either unleash brutal executions or to ride Infinite’s Skyline - essentially a rollercoaster in the sky. You can shoot while on the Skyline and riding above your enemies and then dropping down to execute someone is exhilarating. The variety of Vigors and weapons lends for a large number of strategies and approaches to combat. Elizabeth also is very helpful and will throw you health packs and ammunition. She can also summon certain things into the environment because if story related reasons, which also warrants different approaches. The battlegrounds are all spacious, and combat was always fun. I look forward to replaying the game using different Vigors and weapons. No two people are going to have the exact same experience in Infinite. I do have one minor complaint with the game, and that is the choices you are allowed to make. Occasionally you will be able to choose between one of two actions, but your decision doesn’t change the outcome of the story. When you think about the later portion of Infinite’s story it makes sense, but as a gameplay choice it’s unnecessary. However, as a whole, Infinite rarely misses a beat. The game will likely be praised in the years to come as one of the best single player first person shooters ever made. It’s delightful to see something unique in the gaming industry, and BioShock Infinite delivers.  9.5/10",

As a fair warning to potential buyers, I'd like to state that this review is in no way professional or objective, as it focuses on my personal experience with the game and its entire franchise. Also, my review isn't weighed by pros and cons, but by the overall experience, presentation, and gameplay of Bioshock Infinite.  Okay...  My overall experience with the game was satisfactory. The story is well-structured and its progression is fluid. Voice-acting is stellar, and the visuals (although not the most demanding on a PC) are incredible.   There are however, a few shortcomings (according to me): the game is short (10 hours to beat it, including exploration/side objectives) and even if the game does allow for some exploration of the city of Columbia, exploration doesn't feel quite as adventurous as it was in the first Bioshock. Furthermore, enemy movement and spawning are both very predictable. The first Bioshock had a more randomized spawn system for enemies, and the area you were in was never actually clear of Splicers. In this installement, combat is more centered on shooting instead of using your environment (hell I even forgot I had Vigors), which falls short on combat experience as areas always become clear of enemies after a predictable ambush.  The game is also quite linear, which contributes to its fluidity, but also to its limited exploration.  But that doesn't mean this game is boring. The game is very engaging, and its replayability value is quite high. It's just not the Bioshock genre I became accustomed to with the last two installements.   I highly recommend getting the Burial at Sea DLC, as it extends playtime and exploration. I was quite thrilled to return to Rapture, and even more ecstatic to be in a vibrant and live version of Rapture (before its fall). The DLC also incorporates a greater level of freedom and exploration than within the main game.  Conclusion: 7.5/10",

In BSI there are no crazies, no big daddy... it's mostly just the law after you.  The girl, Elizabeth, follows you most of the game... which I found somewhat annoying at times. At least she would find vigor and money every now and then. She became more of a tool to be used to do little tasks.  I'm sad to say, I relied mostly on my physical weapons (shot gun, revolver, etc) rather than my powers... they were seriously an occasional 'support' item for me.  Handling the character was pretty easy. No issues there. Played with mouse and keyboard. I think the 'riding the rails' is was little overrated.   I don't want to review anything else regarding battles and major characters simply because they are kind of spoilers.  I think if you're going to try this game, you can't go in thinking 'This will be just like Bioshock 1/2!' Just don't. You will be disappointed.   You are in the sky city of Columbia.  Not Rapture.

And with the way weapons work, you kind of have to think carefully about which weapons you'll carry with you and use.   The story was great. To truly understand it, you have to pay attention to every detail in the game even the littlest ones. (Like the heads or tails you encounter at the beginning.)

It is entirely dissimilar, and when you take away this being a sequel (since it isn't), what you're left with is really just a boring shooter with a couple of interesting but repetative mechanics, all of which were much-better executed in the first two games.  All that said, the non-gamey elements (for example, the opening sequence, everything up until you immediately need to kill or be killed), are completely excellent. It really set me up for a let down, as it had such a strong start. The story itself (for the main game, not the DLC) is interesting right up until the end (which.. to put it lightly, is awful).

This story also has a critique on society, much like the other two, which in itself holds true to not only the Bioshock series, but the sci-fi genre in general.  However, there were parts of the story that I didn't like, well parts of the story telling. I felt like the story was drawn out to the end and at the very end was just too condensed. I'm not saying it was rushed, there just could've been a little more behind what was going on. This didn't ruin the ending though.  As for the gameplay, it was fun but not too new. Riding the sky rails was nice, but the same old mechanics for a first person shooter. I was completely comfortable with that! I really like the way the average FPS feels. I want to add, though, that the enviorment and the interactivity in said enviorment was fantastic, you really got to experience a whole world.

The extra DLCs are absolutely worth picking up. Episode 1 is no where near as good as Infinite but Episode 2 is really on par with Infinite. I found Episode 1 to be fairly buggy and fairly short but still worth the time. Play style of Episode 2 is extremely different and really adds a nice touch to the play style. Also very entertaining to replay and change your game style from defensive to offensive.",

        {
            "review_text": "Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.  Gameplay: I was never really into Bioshock 1's gameplay, strangely enough. It just never felt like there was any reason why I should give half an ♥♥♥♥ worth of effort, as enemies that seemed (to me) like they had too much health could be defeated by my UT2k4 strategy of 'kinda-zerg-rush-but-not-really.' Because of this, I didn't find myself enjoying Bioshock 1's gameplay all that much. Maybe it was the fact that I played it on console; maybe it's the fact that I had wanted to play the thing for three years, but never had a console/PC that could play it; I don't know. Bioshock Infinite hasn't changed much with regards to the 'you can respawn as much as you want' mechanic, but something feels... different. Better. I've been thinking for a while about it, but I just can't figure out what that thing is.  As implied in the previous paragraph, the basic mechanic of gunplay/mutations hasn't changed all that much. Gunplay feels great and launching a murder of crows at enemies can lead to some pretty dang funny events happening. The big change now is Elizabeth, who essentially acts as another scavenger as well as being able to introduce various tactical elements into areas, such as hooks, turrets, ammo/medkit depots, etc. She can make life a lot easier, since it's not just you having to search through  every stinkin' container in the area  for an emergency medkit. The game still manages to maintain a good level of challenge, though, and I never really found myself running out of ammo (since I often forget to use Vigors 'cuz I'm dumb); a problem I had in Bioshock 1.  Enemies are pretty smart, and the AI seems to have the capacity for group dynamics, to an extent at least. There were a few scenarios where it felt like one enemy was trying to distract me while another tries to flank me. A neat addition would be if Elizabeth warned you about a flanker, but that's not too big of a deal. Bosses are... kinda there and kinda not. There's a trend I've noticed and even a certain publisher stating that video gamers nowadays don't want boss fights in video games. I'm still taken aback by this supposed mentality. It is kinda disappointing that there is no legitimate boss in this game, but there are at least enemies worthy of the title miniboss.  I didn't really have any problems with this game design wise; at least for what was presented. While I would've liked a final boss as opposed to the enemy onslaught at the end, I still walked away from it feeling like I had played a pretty fun game. There is the inclusion of 1999 Mode, but after reading some of the changes, it seems like the kind of difficulty scaling that I don't like at all. Nevertheless, I can definitely recommend this game for just the gameplay, although that's most certainly not all that this game has to offer. 9/10.  Story: Even though the gameplay never really kept me involved in Bioshock 1, the story most certainly did. Ken Levine is a pretty dang good writer, and he  REALLY  shows it here. All of the characters are great, there's pretty heavy topics and symbolism all throughout the story, and the ending... oh, the ending just takes it up to 11. Now that Irrational's done, this really does feel like a swan song for the company, and the lyrics for that song could not have been written better. I've read about some people calling what happens in the ending, but even then, it's presented so stonking well that I couldn't give this game any less than a perfect 10/10 for the story. Man, it's hard not talking about it in depth for the review, but remain spoiler-free I shall.  Graphics: The Bioshock games have always looked good, and Bioshock 1 still looks pretty good to this day. Infinite blows Bioshock 1 clean out of the water, though, and that's not for just the technical aspects. People who have read my reviews know that I'm a sucker for giant, vast architecture. The entire city of Columbia rubs that sweet spot, with one of the most impressive sights (in my opinion) in the game being the mock-up of Mount Rushmore with Comstock's head being at the forefront (also feeding in to the SYMBOLISM!!!!!1). The game most certainly never gets boring to look at. Regarding the technical aspects of the graphics, the game ran pretty consistently at 60FPS all Ultra settings at 1080p on my GTX 760, although framerate tended to drop to about 40FPS when I was around doors, oddly enough. This may just be a thing with my card; it may be drivers; I dunno. It doesn't take away from the experience, but it is noticeable. It ran decently temperature wise, with the highest temperature on my card reaching 65degC. My house is pretty dusty, though, so it may just need a cleaning. Nevertheless, this game isn't too much of a computer smasher, and it just looks fantastic, especially when you turn everything to max and are blinded by THE BEAUTIFUL AMBIENT OCCLUSION HNGNGNGNGNGNGNGNGNG  5/5  Music: The soundtrack is predominately composed of timely 20's/30's music and orchestration. While the orchestra pieces may not be anything you'd listen to in your spare time, they certainly work in game. My only minor issue with the music is the musical sting that ends every combat scenario. I just felt like it would add more tension if they didn't do that every time all the enemies were dead in the area, so that you'd take it much more carefully. Nevertheless, this is a very minor complaint. The 'old-timey' music may be your thing; I thought it was quite alright, but again, it's nothing I'd listen to on my own. It doesn't really need to be, but that can certainly be a point in an OST's favor. Voiceacting is great in this game, with some symbolism being within the voice clips themselves. Booker's VA is the standout in my opinion, running the whole gamut of emotions before the game ends. Everybody else is just great as well. 5/5.  Overall scores are 9/10/5/5; cumulative score of 9.7/10. I knew this game would be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS good. No, seriously, if you were in the same lukewarm boat as me with regards to Bioshock 1's gameplay, this game will pull you right in. The story will keep you going if all else fails. I can see why Yahtzee said this was his game of the year for 2013. It really is that good.",

The best comparison I can draw with this game and another is Metro 2013, the game has a servicable main storyline, nothing spectacular and arguably inconsistent//self contradicting, but immerses the player with well concieved and beautiful environments where NPCs behave as you would expect them too, and the dialogue is superbly written. The side narratives in this game are the most interesting aspect of it, the stories of minor characters and the two conflicting populations will keep the player entralled. The music in this game is also quite well done, despite it being overshadowed by the visual spectacles and dialogue. With solid graphics, gamplay, audio and an unquestionable ability to immerse the player, Bioshock Infinite is a game which will appeal both to players looking for a strong FPS experiene as well as a those looking for an immersive storytelling experience.

The game follows a man by the name of Booker Dewitt who is sent by debt collectors to kidnap a girl named Elizabeth from the city in the sky Columbia, however this game leads him down a path lies, twists and turns that makes you question everything at the end.

The controls, and general playability is pretty much the same as previous bioshocks, you get your plasmids (or vigors in this games case) and you guns, your upgradable weapons and abilities, and your collectibles, the only thing now is you have Elizabeth who will find you ammo, salts, and health whilst in the midst of battle.  Aside from all that i honestly cannot find or think of anything about or in this game that would flaw or deter one from playing it, i can say without a doubt that this game is worth every last cent and i highly recommend it!",

The story is quite entertaining and gets better as you move on through the game, definightly recomend it to all my friends and it's going to be interesting to see how the DLC manages to keep the storyline up playing as booker with that ending. 9/10 ",

For my second vigor I switch off between 'shock jockey' and 'devil's kiss'. There's just something about watching my enemies get ripped apart by crows that just makes me laugh and say 'You fools should not have challenged me.' It makes me think of the infected crows in Resident Evil, except they are attacking your enemies and not you.  I highly reccomend using an compatible controller to play this game.

The art directors on Bioshock Infinite deserve an award nay 64 of them. Coming from a PS3 console, to any console new comers; Bioshock Infinite plays more fluently on a MAC/PC considering you have a more than decent RIG to fully experience this work of art. If any game developers could pull out a world like Columbia off they would be the group at 2K. The characters are phenomenally well written, marvelously voice acted by Courtnee Draper, Jennifer Hale and Troy Baker just to name a few of the main roles. Sadly the DLC add-ons are steeply priced for what their worth I would recommend holding off on them till a seasonal sale on the steam store. To anyone who hasn't had a chance to be engrossed by Bioshock all I ask is 'What are you waiting for?' a 10 out of 10.",

What i usually enjoy from games with a fantasy/ sci-fi genre is the plot and this one certainly made me feel satisfied but confused. Compered to the other endings from Bioshock and Bioshock 2 where in the end you got to choose your ending and feel a bit 'in control' of what you decide (i think), in Bioshock: Infinite you're just forced to follow the main plot with a couple of side quests involving the Vox Poluli and the only choices you make won't do anything to the final outcome.  Some parts of the game give the feel of it being a survival game, scavanging dead bodies and geting rescources (Health, salt, ammo) to keep you going..    You can't always put the burden to Elizabeth to supply you with ammo, salts and health..   There is also a hint of open world since you're able to revisit locations provided you have visited before, but that becomes sort of cumbersome because there are no means of transport, teleportation so it takes a reeealy long time to get there..   Just going back for money and ammo sounds right but you might realise it's not worth it.    If you're a fan of FPS i'd definetly reccomend this due to the immense and frequent engages in battles, the interesting selection of weapons and the sky-hook along with the vigors which give a positive twist onto how the battle will progress. Although the enemies gradually grow tougher and smarter, your arsenal does too. They have also incorporated a logical upgrade shop for your guns and vigors. I thought that the prices were really expensive, I could have just not scavanged everything enough- I'll leave the conclusions to you. There was also clothing involved in gameplay (hat, top, pants etc.) that gave you a certain power from igniting your enemy in fire when you melee him to creating 'ghostly friends' that fight for you when you switch guns(the gun is the 'ghostly ally'). Pretty overpowered if you use them right, that's what i think of it. What i found annoying about the weapon system is that you are only able to hold 2 weapons. Even though it IS logical/ realistic , I believe that due to the wide range of weapons there should be at least 3 slots, but that's just me.    If I rated this out of 10 it would ba a 9/10  , just personal dislikes from the plot that's all        (If you get the season pass you'll get a golden pistol and machine gun along with a full gear kit, really helpful if you're planning to do 1999 mode which is the hardest mode Bioshock: Infinite can offer; The Rupture episodes also are a awesome bonus which is why i bought the season pass in the first place.)

This game's largest fault comes with its relentless frequency and complete narrative irrelevance of its combat. You fight far too many people far too frequently, and it becomes far too repetitive and far too bloody. The game fails to provide any significance to the combat and plasmids to the satisfactory level that the first Bioshock did. It contrasts the incredible experience of the game's non-combat sections in an unfortunate way.  The combat can be fun at times when you're not doing it for copious lengths. It just makes the game feel like you're playing a separated, arbitrary shooter in-between a fantastic explorative story-driven experience.

I missed the big daddies and big sisters of the first two games, The new 'vigors' didnt seem as much fun to use as the old 'plasmids'.   However, I stuck with it and I grew to love it! The game had lots of twists and turns and got really interesting once Booker and Elizabeth started shifting between alternate universes. One particular universe is pretty creepy (the one with the boys of silence). I really lliked the characters of Booker and Elizabeth and liked they way their relationship evovled with the story. There wasnt much characterisation in the original Bioshock games so this was a pleasent suprise. The story's ending was really clever and linked into the original Bioshock universe pretty neatly. I also got to love the new 'vigors'. Undertow was really fun to use, not to mention wizzing about on the skyrail!  THe DLC is definity worth doing as this sews together the strands from the orignal and the Infinte universes, especially part 2. THe game play is quite different from the other games, which keeps things interesting!   ",

            "review_text": "First off I completely recommend the game due to it's great art direction, gameplay, acting and it's decent pace.  The game starts similarly to the first BioShock Game. The player gets a limited amount of information and is put into this great city in the clouds called Columbia. His mission is to save a girl called Elizabeth to wipe away his gamble debts.  As the player gets confronted by a lot of trouble, the story doesn't develop much. It's basically still about Elizabeth. But this girl is interesting and thanks to the great voice acting - believable. I personally felt the story got in the background as soon as you are running around with new helping Buddy Elizabeth. But don't get me wrong, it was not boring. It was just... nothing special... sorta predictable.   As soon as the story progresses further the game got a lot more interesting and I needed to know what the story was about in the end. I thought it would take a different approach and it totally blew me away. Without going into much detail - the ending is yaw dropping - but REALLY confusing. It seems that I was not the only confused player at the end at the game, according to forums full with questions.  Here is a short pro/contra-list if you really need to know if this game is for you:  + art direction + voice acting + vertical gameplay  -/+ pacing -/+ story  - outdated graphics (even for 2013) - difficulty kind of 'switches'  According to Steam it took me about 10,5h to complete the game on Medium. That's not very much if you count that the game doesn't offer multiplayer. Is this game worth to play? Yes. Is it worth full price? Yes, but not for 10,5h of Gameplay. Since the game is over 2 years old, you should have no problem getting this game cheap. Support the developers, we need more good games like this one.",

It's one of those games that once you finish it, you simply can't repeat as everything is just straight up mindblowing as you get to the end.  Crazy great plot and gameplay, the only single negative thing I can remotely think of in this game is that the AI is slightly poor in some areas, their bounds of where they can go are clear and they camp a bit.  Totally worth being so immersed that I've stayed up until 5am almost every night due to the sheer immersion I've been through with this game. Playing it on Hard, was a fun thing too, few minor deaths - not far from a flawless first playthrough and I have became accustomed to spamming F to loot things. The vigor system is great, although being used to 'just shoot' FPS type I have literally not used them at all until towards the very end of the game.  Quality PC port and graphics too, although I've noticed minor stutter in some areas when jumping in a Crossfire configuration (playing at 1080p/144Hz). It has the best use of lighting I have ever seen, in any game out there.  One day I'll return to this, play 1999 mode :D  9.6/10 - GOTY for the release year of this title.",

And let me tell you right now, this game is SOOO GOOD! Pros: -Graphics are not the most demanding but the game still looks so good. I always love when creators prefer to have thier games have a unique style over crazy realism. This game will age well for sure. -The story was very interesting and I liked a lot of the places it went, I really could not predict the story which helped to keep me interested. -Gameplay is simple but a lot of fun. Some people may find this as a negative but I personally did not mind. The game does take more of a guns-blazing, action style gameplay which some people may not like because I've heard how the previous games were more horror-like or something. (again, have not played them, but may try them in the future.) --The best thing this game has to offer to me are it's characters, specifically the main protagonists. Booker and Elizabeth are such colorful characters that you really do care for and will probably not forget about. Even other important characters are memorable, but I say who to keep it spoiler-free.  Cons: -While the story is great, I felt that I couldn't always follow it. Sometimes I felt a bit lost because there were a good amount of times where I would think this is what was happening but it turned out to be this instead. Can get a bit frustrating. (this might just be me though) -While there are many interesting and colorful characters in the game, the main antagonist isn't exactly the greatest. I mean, he's fits the role of a bad guy, but you really don't feel sympathy for him, you just kinda think he sucks and that's it. I'm not calling him a terrible antagonist, but I would have preferred to have had him a bit more fleshed out.  Conclusion: Bioshock Infinite is a fantastic first person shooter, argueably one of the best within the past few years. It has fun (but simple) gameplay, a great (but sometimes confusing) story, and some of the most memorable characters within gaming. I really do believe you should a least check it out. (Also, it's a solid port, I had little to no frame-rate drops or glitches.) Objective Score-9/10 Subjective Score-10/10 *Basically, just get the game!!!",

The voice acting is also very believable and really invested me in the game.   There are a few themes that are covered in this game, for example, racism and religion.

This game however has a satisfactory (if confusing) conclusion, and has some of the best combat gameplay i have ever experienced. Let's talk about the plot. In 1912, you play Booker DeWitt, a mercenary who owes money to a mysterious group of people. Tasked with rescuing a mysterious girl from the sercret airborne city of Columbia, DeWitt must find her to repay his debts. However, he, (and the player) have no idea what they're walking into. The plot is well paced, excellently designed, and is overall a lot of fun. Other characters, such as Elizabeth, Fitsroy, Comstock, and Songbird all fit into the tale of religious and racial intolerance, oppression and captivity. And captivity is the perfect word to describe the game as a whole. Its hard to fault a game which has so many good things about it, with great gameplay, story, graphics, voice acting, soundtrack. In fact, besides a confusing ending, there is very little to fault this game for. While the DLCs fail to live up to this game, this is without a doubt the greatest single player FPS since Half Life 2. And that's saying a lot. Also, you kill racist people. 10/10",

Combats are intense, loud, heart pounding (literally), rapid, blazing -I can go on and on.  Vigours (and Plasmids if you're with the DLC) are of course a comback of Plasmids for this game, and they're even better now. Loads to use, suiting many different play styles.  Weapons are similar differences, but nontheless refreshing to use different weapons everytime.   I've replayed this game countless times and until today I still feel the awe-and-shock of how fantastic this is.   1000000/10.

The main difference that I appreciated soon after starting the game was the combat. The gunplay feels so much better than in the previous game and I found myself using the vigors much more than the plasmids in the previous games just because everything felt so much tighter. Some might say that this game is much more linear than the previous games, but I think the first 2 games were plently linear. They allowed backtracking unlike infinite, but there weren't any real reasons to revisit areas except to get stuff that you missed.  I really enjoyed the story and presentation, having a companion, the beautiful setting and lore. I definitely will be replaying this game some day soon.  Probably the best AAA game I have played over the last few years.",

It started out worse then i expected a typical story in a bioshock themed setting, i hated the game even more.  But the further you get into it the more it gets a hold of you, the story in the long haul will make you love this game much like it made me [someone who hated the game] end up thinking its one of the best games of all times.  Gameplay : Solid, but onhoustly its a shooter on the pc so thats not all to hard. Music : Ok, it all kinda blends in so it fits the game but it doesnt have its grand moment. [a moment in the game where the music made a great moment noticeble better] Story : Awsome, sure it builds up slow and you might hate it at first but the more youll grow to like it.  If you are looking for a intence story in a well created world then this is the one you must own. Personally ive never liked the FPS single player type games considering once yer done playing its completely over, but this game has turned me around and i will definetly be on the watch for another jewel like this one.",

I am terrible at FPS games and put the game on easy at first, but eventually restarted on medium, so the game is not especially difficult. The fighting mechanics were enjoyable, again for someone who does not often play FPS games, and the ability to switch vigors/weapons and play with the combinations was fun. Although the variety of enemies was limited, I considered that realistic, even though the rest of the game was not, i.e. floating cities. I see no specific reason someone needs to fight 30 different enemy types, and the fact I didn't tire of the limited types should speak for the rest of the game.

I was sad to see it end but the two dlc packs tied it up nicely to the beginning of bioshock 1 so I can't complain too much. I don't want to give any spoilers, so I will stop here. This isn't about the big daddies or the little sisters. And while you may not understand what Columbia (the city in the sky) has to do with Rapture (the underwater city), by the end of the game, I promise it will all makes sense and it is worth the wait. There are a lot of really good plot twists that will blow you away. You won't see them coming but by the time you are done with the game, you will see the story for how good it really is.",

Initially, I thought that the game was meh at best, and stopped playing after about only an hour or so. Boy was I wrong. This game was probably the most action-packed, mind-boggling, and heart-wrenching fps I have ever played. The gameplay is fluid and well polished, the game mechanics very well thought out, and the amount of self-exploration too high to count. I felt that it could have done much better if they had invested more time and money into the actual cut-scenes so that they look even more polished but I suspect most of that went into the story-line which by and far made up for the sometimes sketchy graphics. This game gets credit for probably my favorite video game ending yet. It also gets credit for the first game ever to have gotten me on a jump-scare.",

For the first three fourths of the game, I was really disappointed. The story here, AMAZING, but I felt like the gameplay is stuck in 2008. I'm not going to say the gameplay improves in the later fourth of the game, (because it doesn't), but at that point I was accepting of the gameplay and wanted to progress because the story is that damn good. I find most people will agree with me on this. HOWEVER, do not buy this game without the DLC, the DLC is more of what I thought Infiite should've been, and it wraps up the story well. If you haven't played the fist Bioshock, I don't reccomend playing the DLC for Infinite until you do albeit. It will be a better more well rounded experience.",

            "review_text": "Let me just begin by saying, I f**king love this game! Albiet, the graphics are dated, it's gameplay is relatively unchanged (from the previous bioshock installments, with the exception of only being able to carry two weapons... WHAT THE HELL!), but the story... oh my god the story. Bioshock has never been lax in that department, whether it be (ahem... SPOILER ALERT!) Jack unknowingly following orders through 'Would you kindly,' or Delta just being Delta, (ALERT OVER!) This game will make you think you know whats going on, only to rip it away and show you how blind you really were. This also applies to the DLC, Burial at Sea parts 1 and 2 (sorry, i have yet to play Clash in the Clouds yet, but when I do I'll update my review of this game). I found the first part of Burial at Sea to be disappointingly short, only taking around an hour or two to fully complete. It was also very linear, but due to the events in Bioshock: Infinite, this new story intrigued me. I won't go into detail, but the ending of part 1, although short, made me instantly go to part two, which quickly caught my intrest. The most notable point in part 2 is that it sees you play as Elizabeth, which brings with it an entirely new gameplay style. Instead of the traditional, shoot-til-you're-out-of-bullets-and-eve playstyle, Elizabeth is far more stealth based, using a combonation of plasmids, crossbows, and other various items to help her eliminate her targets without ever being seen. Elizabeth's arsenal isn't nearly as expansive as Booker's, but what it lacks in pieces it makes up for in versatility. She can get smoke bombs, tranquilizer darts, and bells just to name a few items, and all are equally helpful.   Some of you, however, may have never played Bioshock, and let me elaborate a little on the basic gameplay of those titles. You are given a combonation of guns and Plasmids (or in Bioshock: Infinite's case, Vigors). Guns are just as they sound, but can be upgraded throughout the game to become more effective. Some of the guns that Jack, Delta, and Booker have throughout the series include Machineguns, Pistols, Shotguns, Ect, basically what you would expect to find in a shooter. where the combat differs, however, is in the use of powers known as Plasmids or Vigors. these can do a variety of things such as taking over enemies, throwing balls of fire or electricity, and calling on swarms of various normally harmless animals to rather ruthlessly murder your foe. These are some of the most enjoyable weapons in any Bioshock game.  I realize this review is getting pretty long, so I think I should wrap it up. In conclusion, One cannot call themselves a true gamer without playing all three Bioshock games. It's like saying 'The cake is a lie' and none of your supposedly gamer friends get the referece. I think it goes without saying, all the Bioshock games get 5 out of 5 from me.",

You are playing as the Agent Dewitt trying to save Elizabeth in the flying city Columbia, she's trapped by the so called the mechanical SongBird. The games influences the american style with a lot of flags and songs through the game and since the outplay is in 1912 it's very nicely made, the graphics is stunning and amazing, the core of the graphics is to recommend highly. It's a world of chaos, to save one girl. In previous games there was usage of plasmids, now it's called Vigors instead and there is a lot of upgrades in the game but also huge space of containers to loot, containers which usually contains ammo for the weapons or health or even some small coins. This is a game i will not just play once, possibly three times. It gave me chills and had lots of fun during playing BioShock Infinite. GIving this game 5/5 isn't enough, it deserves a lot of credits for such a great story. I haven't even tried the 1999 mode yet, this is something that will be great of fun. Don't hesistate if you are thinking of buying this game, i'd say it's great worth it and all the time you will spend of such an amazing story, maybe to convince yourself you can watch my pictures at the Steam Partnership Page.

Vigors are a fun way to add magic to the game without making it seem like a mage-type feature similar to many RPG's. Elizabeth is a really well-balanced character that players will really feel attached to. Also, she is almost never in your way during a fight and instead actually makes herself useful by finding money and items like health and ammo throughout the game. She's definitely one of, if not my favorite sidekick. There are choices in the game which is always appreciated although they don't make a huge difference in the end. The ending is shocking, thought-provoking, and feels conclusive.",

First the graphics. They are a mix of steampunk with late 1800's early 1900's feel. But in some parts the colors and objects seem cartoony and unrealistic. There isn't a good balance when at one time they are stunning, while another looks boring.   Now for the port before anything. I'm sure this game was enjoyable for console users but the pc port is awkward. With some controls like V for melee and Z for zoom, vigors wasn't right click, J for journal was awkward in combat, just annoying things like that.   Gameplay was fantastic. This does take a twist on the shooter genre. Mixing 'magic', with different approaches like ziplining, and unique weapons make it fun to shoot it out.   And last I thought the story was the best of any game I have played. I'm not going to spoil anything but you get a prety lengthy story, it's almost like it's 'Infinite'. There are so many parts woven in that sometimes they twist the story and you couldn't predict it. The voxophones help tell the story which is unique and makes it enjoyable to listen to.   Well those are my thoughts. I give it a 8.8/10",

No more underwater ruins and spliced up people, everything is great in the utopia city in the clouds.  The good:  - Game looks amazing. Maybe it's not the highest poly counts of all time, but damn the art is cool. - Runs great. I think Infinite runs awesome even on lower end stuff. - Sound and music design is great. Not much else to say about it. There's also really hard to find easter eggs in the game when it comes to sounds. Like voices backwards or music slowed 1000%, to make it sound like just random ambient crackle. - Story. I guess some people would be divided on this, me too kinda. The writing is good and the DLC adds to it. Not every story has to be easy to understand and explainable. Things get really complex and there's a good amount of plot holes probably, but it does get you thinking, unlike most stories in games. Even after completing all the DLC I'm still thinking about the story and that's something! - Voice acting of course. The two leads are great. Everyone else too. I don't really mind having voice for the player character. - Level design. Matches the original Bioshock for the most part. Great amount of secrets and easter eggs. I thought I'd find most in one play through, nope, missed a lot of ♥♥♥♥. - Skyhook stuff is off the hook.  The bad:  - Gameplay. There's really no real improvements over the previous games except the skyhook stuff and tears, but while okay the actual gunplay wasn't that great. You are limited to two weapons, like it or not, though in reality there's always extra ones laying next to you. Elizabeth is great sidekick, but she alone can't fix the issues with the combat. - Kinda short. It's filled with content and crafted with love, but if one were to rush it through with no care for backgrounds, locations or story you would find the game too short. - Upgrade system. The permanent scaling from the infuses or whatever is fine, they promote exploration and are in pretty cool locations. The money spending on upgrades isn't that cool though. I liked the original weapon upgrade system from first bioshock and the ADAM system.  - Lack of Choice. No more multiple endings. You don't get to choose between anything at all, fully linear experience.  8.5/10. I think too much content was cut. Going for fully linear style isn't really great for replayability. Gameplay wasn't improved from past and actually made changes for the worse with limiting the guns, making them generic as ♥♥♥♥ and just overall lazy upgrade systems. Visuals, acting, sounds, locations and for the most part, the story, are what saves this game from being very medicore. ",

I expected fast-, fun gameplay and a complelling storyline, but what I got was just a relitivly easy shooter with characters that often faded into the background, unelbaroated backstory and character devlopment and a boring ending. The theme of the game was that no matter what choice you make everything is inevitable, something that would've shown through a lot better if they actually gave you choices. Elizabeth's character is inconsistent and kinda useless really; she changes personality like three times during the game, and its only 15 hours (if you're a completionist) long. Compared to the original bioshock, its just nowhere near as good. The gameplay was one of the greatest letdowns for me. The guns don't really differ, vigors are forgettable and the mission and plot structered around it feel artifical. One of the large plot lines is when you go in search of a vigor (that you will never use again afterwards) and end up going through a ton of weird ♥♥♥♥? Like, you meet some unexplained old ally and he accuses you of, first, being a ruthless, glorious murderer, and then a artifical man doing someone else's bidding, a tin soilder? And then its forgotten for the rest of the game. The missions are boring and I don't understand why the zepplin level was needed. it introduced a new element for a one time thing, and worst of all, its the last battle. The powers system was woefully underdevloped and I used vigors maybe like three times in total in actual combat? I ended up just taking a sniper and switching between a carbine and crank and I beat the game with those three.",

I can't praise Infinite's writers enough, from the dialogue to the careful way they tie in the Infinite world with Bioshock I &amp; II without tarnishing previously established plots, they really created something powerful. I resisted playing Infinite for about a year after it was released because I was such a huge fan of the first two games, and was worried Infinite would ruin the world for me. However, even though Infinite is a clear departure from the aesthetic and feel of Bioshock I &amp; II, it's a fantastic FPS that absolutely manages to fill the rather large shoes of its predecessors. Infinite offers various difficulties suitible for different levels of gameplay, as well as some excellent DLC. If I have one criticism, it's that Infinite fails to have the scary moments you might be used to from the first two games. Although, Infinite is also not afraid of grim storytelling, which is one of my favorite parts of the series.

Unfortunately, there were a few continuity issues, but that may be expected given the overall premise of the story. I was mildly shocked at how abruptly the end came about though.  At times the combat felt flavorless but the story progression helped keep me wanting to get past its issues.  Overall, my main complaints was the upgrade system. It felt clunky and unfulfilled and once I had finished upgrading a few weapons, the game was already over, and I would never touch any of the other ones. Except out of desparation.

The city gradually falls, and will soon collapse. Also tied to the story of a young girl Elizabeth who has a very interesting abilities. The graphics in the game order is higher than in the previous parts but in general essentially similar to what we saw earlier. The game takes you in the fast passage about 7 hours!

Game 9/10   Игра, в которой от прыжков и полетов вскружиться голова а о графике и эффектах и говорить не надо ) в этой игре все идеально ) палец вверх  Стоит сказать что игра отошла от жанра ужасы. Для многих это будет приятный для других менее приятное открытие! Игра являться прямым продолжением и завершением предыдущих частей.  Сюжет разворачивается в парящем в небе городе Колумбия. Город потихоньку падает и скоро рухнет. Также сюжет завязан на молодой девушке Элизабет у которой есть очень интересные способности.  Графика в игре порядком выше чем в предыдущих частях но в общей сути похожа на то что мы видели ранее.  Игра займет у вас при быстром прохождении около 7 часов! Но поверьте этого достаточно))))  Логотипом игры является разорванное подобие Американского флага со словом Бесконечность  Ну я думаю многие оценят эту игру высоко, кто-то потому что он извращенец и будет ждать сексуальную сцену главного героя и Элизабет, а кто-то потому что проникся этой игрой и ощутил всю ее глубину и интересный динамичный сюжет!

And the setting and story are just awesome, in the true sense of the word. It is set in the city of Columbia, which is suspended in the clouds and surrounded by heavenly music (pun intended).

The expansion packs add a good substory to it, however having not ever played Bioshock 1 I felt like I was missing a good many references. Like fake laughing at a joke that was a little funny to you, but funnier to everyone else who were present for the story behind it. Very well-made, no glitches or bugs that come to mind. The cornerpiece of this particular game, however, is the story. It truly is a masterpiece. *mini spoilers* When you start this game, you may think you have some inkling of how it will end. Listen to me carefully. You have absolutely no idea what you are in for. Accept it. I paced my room for a good seven to ten minutes just contemplating the ending, trying to figure it out. As a Star Trek fan, I am no stranger to paradoxes and causal loops and alternate realities, but this is on another level entirely. Mind-blowingly elegant.",

The setting looked gorgeous and the unfolding story was both horrfic as mind blowing. In the end I really felt like the setting promised infinite possiblieties of epic proportions and I desperately wanted it to continue.  Sadly the 'Burial at Sea'-DLCs were pretty much the opposite of what I imagined it to be. The gameplay was OK, especially the sneaking bit were an interesting change of pace. BUT It's very short and instead of playing with endless possiblieties, you get an abortion of all futures. It's as if the sole purpose of the DLC was the Developers making a petty attempt, that no one else plays with their toys.  tl;dr: Main game awesome, I highly recommend it, the Mission-DLCs were a let down.",

Not to forget that this game looks nice as shizzle. Like really nice. Emotions will run deep when you click that start story button as it sends you into a world full of magic vigors and strange people such as the twins.   The DLC's are also that of a masterpiece, wrapped in the fused storylines of both Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite. The first DLC isn't as noice as the second one but it's still worth playing. It's kind of a filler or build up DLC that leads to the second DLC. The second DLC however really makes you say 'damn son'. It explains and shows a fair bit of information about things you didn't understand before in both Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, such as the origin of the famous 'would you kindly' phrase and the importance of song bird.  ♥♥♥♥ just get's real and if you don't understand muiltiverse theory then there is a high chance you'll have no clue of what's happening.

The whole journey through the story lasted me roughly 10 hours on hard difficulty. I felt like every moment of gameplay was well handcrafted and beautifully done. The setting, the story, and the interactions between everybody and everything really sold the game to me.  I have not played any of the previous Bioshock games (yet), but I was able to understand the story and follow it the whole game without feeling like I was missing the punchline to the joke.  I bought this game three years after its release date and I wish I could say that it showed its age. For $7.49 during a sale, this game is well worth it.    P.S. The DLC are great, but the first one is a bit shorter than one would expect. All in all, a great experience only made better with the DLC.",

I thought the game builds really well to the ending and ends on a pretty spectacular note. I think this is a game that you need to go into the story blind to get the best out of though.  The combat is good. It's enjoyable enough to play but I wouldn't say is a strength of the game or the series in general. If you played the previous games and liked the combat then you're bound to like this.  Graphically this is a very bright and vibrant game and at times looks beautiful.

To add on, the visual and audio for the game is absolutly breathtaking. I definitely recommend this game to others. Although, if you plan on playing the entire Bioshock series (Bioshock, Bioshock 2, and Bioshock Infinte), I suggest playing backwards (Bioshock Infinite - Bioshock 2 - Bioshock). Trust me, the whole series will make a lot more sense if you go in that order.  EDIT: You know what Steam award I'm nominating this for...",

The story of Elizabeth and Booker is epic and complex, both of them grow on the player, specially Elizabeth, who is the greatest AI partner i have ever seen. Plotwise is great like all Bioshocks, and it has a twist at the end that will destroy your brain harder than the one in the first game. Combat is fun and the variety in vigors allows for a lot of experimentation in gameplay styles, until you figure out that there are a couple of them that are overpowered and favour those over the others most of the time.  I can't recommend this game enough, even if you don't like FPS you should still give it a chance.",
