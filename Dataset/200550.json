This is a different game, and I've really enjoyed playing it. Has decent graphics, pretty good gameplay, and is pretty fun. 4/5 :D",

You'r much more a Wallmart Store Owner trying to keep the customers (Heroes) inside so you can clean their pockets dry, than an evil lord. The whole freaking game is about pleasing the heroes. And it quickly get boring and annoying. And you so desperatly wants the game to be good since you loved Dungeon Keeper so much, but it doesn't. Just not worth it.",
