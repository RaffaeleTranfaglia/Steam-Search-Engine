            "review_text": "After compelting the second puzzle-cube I must have exited out of the wrong side of it, because the game locked my progress. I could no longer enter the cube (there were not enough 'blue orbs' left to activate the torch), I could not get around the cube. After jumping into the ocean the game reloaded me back onto the wrong side of the cube; my progress was completely haulted. Up until this point I found the game boring and full of perplexing design decisions. More than half of my time investment consisted of 'non-game' elements: rolling the ball through long boring forest corridors, collecting blue orbs with no explanation, no decision-making, and no challenges to be found. I can't comment on the difficulty of the puzzle elements because the game broke on me so early, but what I experienced was a frustrating camera and somewhat janky controls. The two puzzles were uninteresting. 1/5",

It could be 'UDK stop working' or 'run out of video memory' - optimization is poor, I had off all effects, changed to lower screen resolution, but game still shuttering - it's hard to control ball, you just can't feel it - problem with collision system, a couple of time I get out of map or ramp - orb (important things) could get stuck and it's hard to get them out - checkpoints don't work too good - before I wrote this I have been in underground and air flow must send me to next cave. It's always sends me to central where are blockade, and one time when I didn't fall I was trying to jump in, but I found invisible walls  Anyway I want to finish this, but it could be hard.",

            "review_text": "This was an incredibly good game as an interactive piece of art!  The gameplay is also fun and casual, but by the end, I felt a deep and lingering sense of attachment to the ball, the whale and the setting - despite the lack of dialogue or any obvious displays of narrative. It may be the fact that the ball had no way to communicate and no one to communicate with, and must therefore keep the experience of its journey internalized throughout the game, that you feel  for  it more: the silent protagonist. But this feeling may depend on the sensitivity of the player.  Another point of praise goes to the soundtrack, which was beautiful, relaxing and fitting to the game.  Technically, the game was sound, with some areas left for improvement. The camera reaction to world collisions can be jarring, and coupled with the strong motion blur used by the game, may cause a few people eye strain or motion sickness. Loading models sometimes caused momentary pauses in the middle of gameplay; and jumps in model level-of-detail are sometimes incongruent.  Overall, I recommend you in buying this game. :)",

            "review_text": "I really liked the idea of this game, but it started to punch me in the face as soon as I discovered how many glitches there are. The pysics are a little shaky but not laughingly funny either. The first time I played, I didn't see a save button so I assumed it would auto-save as soon as I completed a level. haha. hahaha. nope. I quit and had to replay the first three levels again. I came up to the fourth level and I somehow managed to convince the game I already finished it, without even entering it. That would seem nice, but I couldn't get past it in any way, so I was basically stuck. right. reboot the game. start all over again. oh no wait, I didn't. I stopped.  Oh and the tutorial at the beginning does not explain how to enter a level, and it leaves you to figure that out too. (Hint: It's the little floating thingies, you'll need three of those)  I do seriously not recommend the game. sorry.",

            "review_text": "The game stutters terribly, the controls are really sluggish and imprecise. The gameplay outside the 'greenhouses' is pretty linear and only serves to be pretty. The gameplay inside the lighthouses suffer from the controls and camera problems.  Example: The greenhouse can rotate and crush your camera to just a few 'inches' away from your sphere thing, and then it'll take you like 10 seconds just to recover the camera. All the while, I felt really sick to my stomach as I was forced to zoom in on the sphere that closely.  Additionally, you also can't Alt-Tab without graphical errors that require you to Quit Back to the Desktop.  Don't be fooled by the Pax Australia badge, that apparently isn't a sign of quality. This game isn't much more than a final project for a game design program.",

There's a touch of narrative, not in spoken word or in text, but in exploring the environment and seeing the wonders that are there. A part of me wishes to keep going, to explore more of this fantastic setting. What is the mysterious blue ball and the glass puzzle houses? Why are they intermixed with what appears to be native villages?  The soundtrack is nice, soft and comforting, aiding in an almost tropical experience. Yet, there is an undercurrent of mystery in it.  For those that are a fan of Portal, this is a must have.",
