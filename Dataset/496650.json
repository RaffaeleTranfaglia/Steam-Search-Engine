Then, you walk into a ghost town - the same ghost town seen in games like 'Devil's Share' and 'The Note' - it's a map pack called 'HE - Ghost Town MegaPack', available on the Unity Store for $45, and it appears in this game completely unaltered.  The town contains buildings that are pitch black inside and there is no flashlight or source of light.  At one point, you'll come across a monster covered in poop that pops out of a barrel for a 'jumpscare.'  Yep. That's the game. You can see most of the stuff I just described in the screenshots for the game if you're skeptical, but this is a joke. A distinctly unfunny one.",
