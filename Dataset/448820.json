            "review_text": "I could have really enjoyed this game, if it actually worked. You have NO control over when the game chooses to save, so you're basically just playing until it forces you to save in a situation which is untenable and you have to start over. Supposedly this bug has been fixed as of this review -- I assure you it is not. Fought stubbornly to the 5th level or so because I figured I might be able to power through it... boy was I wrong. As an effect of 'gas vents' the game started saving every other move to finally hang up in an infinite loop of autosaving while my character was forced to be in stasis while making fuel cells. Because stasis goes on for thousands of turns, and it seemed to be saving every turn to other turn at this point... the game ground to a screeching halt. Wish I could have solved the mystery -- but the game is broken.",
