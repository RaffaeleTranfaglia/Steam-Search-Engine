            "review_text": "Echoing and further summarizing what reviews before me have said, this is a pretty cool game with some major, perhaps deal-breaking flaws.  The premise of the game is simple, straightforward, and works the way you expect it to. You start with a lump sum of cash and are expected to buy your first vehicle. Could be a car (meaning self-contained transport, like a flatbed or an armored car) or a truck, requiring a trailer. Afterwards, hire a driver that has the required licenses. In both cases, you have a lot of options.   Vehicles can be selected on the grounds of:  • Price • Storage/transport capacity • Speed • Reliability • Ease or difficulty of repair • Predicted lifespan and depreciation rate.  Employees can be selected based on their starting wage, experience, and skills. Drivers have certain licenses which you can train them in and get faster as they gain experience. Managers have additional skills that make your business more efficient, however do not have much effe-....well, actually no. They do just as much as managers do in real life  Buy things, hire drivers, get contracts, make money. Fun, right?  Bugs:  This game is horrible, like, unfathomably horribly coded. Minor bug: The personnel market *completely* changing every couple of hours (which is about a second at the slowest game speed), so you have to pause every time you want to hire someone, because their portraits move, but the buttons stay the same, so you click the button that was for person A and you hire person J because in the last microsecond, his face moved up the queue. This is the same for contracts as well, so again, unless the game is paused, you might accept a contract that is far too big for your vehicle or must be completed faster than you can drive.  The game has no concept of retaining sound settings and must be configured via launcher. Actually, no settings can be changed inside the game or on the fly.   Major Bug:  All contracts must be completed within a certain amount of time, notwithstanding it takes about 45 in-game days to drive what appears to be no more than ten miles, you are given an average speed your vehicle must travel at in order to satisfy the contract. However, up to a certain point it is impossible because traffic affects whether you complete or fail a contract. If there is a car in the passing lane, your trucks will rarely make an attempt to pass in the slow lane. Furthermore, if you fail a contract, your truck may simply stop. That's it, road closed. It will never move and cars will back up behind it indefinitely. You cannot resolve this bug because your vehicle and driver must be in the garage in order to be sold and fired, respectively.  Deal-breaker:  Despite the fact that most factories have large, large, loading zones (that only get bigger as you make them more profitable), the maximum amount of vehicles that can exist within the loading dock is two. However, the maximum number of vehicles *that are moving* within the loading zone is one, meaning that if you ever have three trucks doing business with the same factory or, god forbid, you have a competitor doing business with a factory, you will have a line of trucks five cars long waiting for the one guy who is moving his truck in the loading zone. This will invariably cause you to fail all contracts that includes that factory. And since any good competitor AI does business with a multitude of clients, all factories will see competitor trucks and cause you to fail, this makes over half of the game maps unplayable.  And since the previous bug makes any map not playable for long, the amount of time you can play this game instead of restarting it is pretty small.  Cool concept, poorly executed, I do not recommend this game, however consider trying it sometime if a friend already bought it, or if it is ever on sale more than 50% off.",

Moreso because while working as a graphic designer, my principal client was a freight &amp; shipping management company. I can tell you that this game really captures the complexity of running and managing a trucking distribution company. If you're into micromanagement, this will keep your neurons busy and give you a 'control phreak high' :)   I recommend this game which somehow passed unnoticed when it was first published.",

YAY be the freight tycoon of a super small island????  UPDATE: i decided to play a lot more to give the game a fair chance. As it turns out everything i didnt like about it before DID NOT CHANGE... Its still small maps and small scale, which in my mind does not make for ideal tycoon gameplay. i like tycoon games and i was really hoping this was a more modern Open TTD. The game is not that bad if you enjoy the small scale.",

Your trucks could be broken, your employees retire, new companies come, and you have to react all these problems. You have to make a strong base for your company (just like in real life), with various type of trucks to make sure you can do your job the best way. For me this game is 10/10.",
