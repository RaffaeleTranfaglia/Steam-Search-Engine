It's a recommended and not recommended..   The good: +Pretty graphics +Satisfying feeling capturing an enemy cell +Eufloria/Boid clone  The bad: -Feels like a port with unprecise controls and no visual feedback of the orders given.  -Leveled up cells hardly differ visually at level 3, 4.  -Lags when blue dots are at the same place. CPU 4770S, GPU 660GTX.",

            "review_text": "Good cell game, calming and relaxing. AI is annoying at best and often will do extremely stupid things, making a very easy game. As an example, one of the early-mid levels in original has several neutral organisms orbiting around the center with you and the enemies in the middle. Ended the level after a minute or so and zoomed out to see 2-3 groups of antibodies from each color just chasing a rogue neutral cell. Occasionally the ai will launch coordinated attacks, but by that time you should have snowballed enough to just roll over their cells ignoring your own losses and win the level.  Tactical advantage in moving cells consists of saving minute amounts of time by moving close to neutral cells you plan to take, and past that the only time you'll move a cell is to stop it moving after the AI bumps into it. As someone who played all of the Phage games, which are free by the way, this one is a disappointment with its faceroll difficulty and dearth of tatical choices. As an added bonus, there is no strategic value in letting antibodies sit idle at all. Ever.  The fastest way to clear levels is by selecting all antibodies and doing one task at a time, overwhelming enemy and neutral cells, while the constant stream of antibodies flowing in the spaces between your cells neutralizes almost all efforts to attack you. Biowall makes it even easier by limiting the area you have to mouse over to select all of your antibodies. This all being said, its atmosphere and music fit the overall theme of low difficulty and make for a relaxing experience. Except when the AI bump into you.",

            "review_text": "I've put in a good amount of hours on this game. It's interesting at first, but it quickly becomes repetetive. The entire premise of the game: Grow/acquire cells. That's it. No depth. No massive strategy. It's grow-and-conquer. If you're not fast enough at circling your antibodies and getting them to beef up your cell, you won't be able to get anywhere. Eventually, it's about overwhelming your computer opponents with the number of cells/antibodies.  Some levels have a bug that allegedly was fixed in a prior patch but still persists -- your cell(s) can get stuck in the cell walls. Ditto for opponent's cells. Sometimes your cells will overlay with another cell, and you can't click either. If your cell gets stuck in a wall/overlayed, you can't move, you can't send out antibodies, you have to restart the level. This makes for an infuriating gameplay, especially at higher levels. I've lost several games in one high level because my cell keeps getting stuck in cell walls.  Responsivity of the cells: You will click and point for your cel to move. Nope! The cell likes to make up its own mind if it may or may not move. Same for the antibodies. They'll move when you don't want them to, or they'll not move when you've given them an order. This bug appears about ten percent of the time in any level.  Finally, the game only has so many levels. There's no random 'map' or unlimited play. Once you win the game, that's it. You're done. You can restart, but, what's the point now that you know how to win every map?  I'd like to recommend the game, but the bugs and repetition aren't worth it.",

This is suppose to be a stragety game not a grind on which organism is stronger... And believe me, they throw you in levels where you up against multiple organisms that have already reached stages 3-4 while your at stage 1. The enviroment isnt as helpful as the indicate it would be. you just have to lucky enough that the ai are dumb enough for it to matter. Is it worth $10?... No, its not. I just bought it to play for the trading cards. Plus, I got it for a lot cheaper when it was on sale.",

Its like Tenticle Wars(but annoying). its fun and addicting, and id be on hour 3 but i got impatient and actually wrote a review... for once...  Cons: Holy sweet christ it LMFAO(L=lagged).   Seriously though, it is a great game. But when you need to turn res to 320x200 for a lag free game at the cost of even being able to play said game, thats bad.. Now 800x600 it lagged a bit, but i could still make out my dot killing anohter dot. Not an my most favored foreplay, but it got the job done. Cheers...

It's still playable (though frustrating), as you have to repeatably perform the same action until the unit responds. You can only control one cell at a time (also tedious). Once reaching the middle levels however, it becomes more a matter of luck, since things happen too quickly for the shoddy controls to allow you to keep up. Once you have made your 4th attempt at trying to make the cell stop or change direction, it's far too late, and the game is reduced to a spectator sport.",
