Sadly, many of the achievements not work either, i still dont understand why DEVs add achievements to their game if they cant handle it.  Developers of this game dont even response on forums, according to steam they released a game allmost every month this year, so a sell and run game company.  I could recommend the game but not working achievments and losing progress because of not working saving mechanism is too gamebreaking for me, so i cant.  ",

            "review_text": "The game is actually quite hard at start, The quests are sometimes rewarding but most of the time not worth your effort. Personally i got quite far just by traveling between the starting city Zin Ta Ka and the first town Miindor and occasionally going to the mine Ragu Dos. Going anywhere else seems like waste of money to me, especially crossing bridges is quite expensive and you get robbed around 25% of your trips anyways. So you can't really affort to move around much even with a bank of around 100k. Hiring mercenaries in the Tavern is all right at the start but later it does not seem to make a lot of difference. The gameplay seemed a bit limited ; you buy/sell goods hire mercenaries and get robbed. Sometimes you go to the mine to pick up diamonds and sell them as well. Quest are just travel from A to B. I never got any useful infromation by buying someone a drink. Personally the most deciding factor for not recomending the game is the Trading dynamic. Prices of goods are not determined individually but are based on the location. That means all goods at one site are either cheap or expensive compared to other locations. Therefore you can't sell sth in a town and buy sth else. Furthermore you can't wait in a town or store your goods/money so you have to travel which means travel expenses and getting robbed. This is quite annoying if prices in both towns are around the same and you just have to travel to waste time.  I played this game for around 6 h. I would played it further to see whether i missed something crucial of the game if only i was able to save the game. For some reason the save-button does nothing ...",

            "review_text": "The main issue I have with this game is the economic system. The prices of goods rise and fall randomly. They all rise or fall together as well. The prices of different categories of goods should be impacted by external factors. For example, a town experiences a heat wave and a drought so the price of food increases while the price of blankets decrease.   Overall, the game is quick to learn but only because it has very basic gameplay. This also leads to limited replayability. If you aquire the game for cheap give it a try. Otherwise don't waste your time and money.",

            "review_text": "Hello folks, let me tell you about medieval trading game.  First of, this is not even trading game let alone 16 bit game, do you see anywhere 16 bit graphics and visuals? I sure don't. This is mobile port, with that said it already explains a lot, what is so bad about it besides being mobile port? Before you can even travel to next town you have to pay for it not knowing how much it will be, e.g. it can cost you 52 coins / 192 coins / 16 coins, these prices are so random even from that game's already lost. Each town you visit can buy and sell same goods which are provided only. And again checking out each town's shop you can't know if trip was worthwhile. Only way to gain any profit is to go to abandoned cave mine and 'explore' for diamonds, and each town also has set their own price for diamonds. During the trip there is possibility to get robbed by bandits which is normal but they can hurt you by stealing huge amount (also its random amount) of coins causing to loose game. If you managed to sell something and gain profit from it, then bring more goods to same place again prices will be lower than previously was. Even if you have to happen just to pass through town to get to another without trading, prices are drastically changing with no good reason at all. Everything here is just complete random.  Shouldn't have bought it, i only did it because i had coupon and game had trading cards in it, but even then this action was questionable, serves me right.   Overall: Game is based on pure luck, patience and your nerves! ",

This is rather difficult because the traveling costs are too high and it's pretty much impossible to make gold by buying goods from one city and selling in another, mostly due to prices being rather random. So I found myself mining for diamonds to sell and doing quests that are kind of unrewarding because travel costs usually exceed the reward. Often they are a lot longer than the initial 'chat' with the quest giver makes it look. All in all a bad trading game. Go trade in TF2 or CSGO.  Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

Every item you can buy is linked in price in every city, which means you either buy everything you can in a city or sell everything. There's no strategic thought of buying item A and selling item C before travelling. Because the prices vary so little and the cost of travelling safely is so high, it'll take you an hour and a half before you can actually start earning money... And then you'll find out that the save system is broken and you have to do everything all over again. The game also contains numerous glitches, including NPCs that say they'll pay you 0 gold for your help. BTW, it's not 16bit, they couldn't even get that right.",
