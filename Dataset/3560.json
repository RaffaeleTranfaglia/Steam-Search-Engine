            "review_text": "There's something so satisfying when I twist these pretty gems and watch them explode. The obvious secret to getting the big points is to have consecutive matches, and also to take advantage of the bonuses. My high score in Classic Mode is 1,489,570. In Zen mode I'm at level 51, but that doesn't mean anything, because you can't lose in that mode. (is it ok to brag while reviewing a game? I have no idea) and it's a fun challenge trying to beat my best score. A few of my friends think this game is silly, but they seem to not be able to get their head around the simplicity of the twisting manipulation. The people who get this game are usually able to see 3 or 4 steps ahead, and those are the folks that usually have fun with this game. (That's not a rule, just something I've noticed) Sound effect, which mostly consist of incresingly intense explosions, are a blast. Dumb pun, but I had to do it. When I look at my hours played, it makes me think I may need Bejeweled Twist Rehab. Get myself a BT 30 chip. Or maybe just switch addictions.",
