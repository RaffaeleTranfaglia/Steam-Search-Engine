            "review_text": "And just when I thought that there ain't no puzzle game/arcade game that could teach the old dog some new tricks...  Matris is a dynamic puzzle game that bears resemblance to Lumines and Tetris. The player task is to fill the map/matrix with tretromino-like blocks, provided by the AI. What sounds easy to learn, seems difficult to master - and that learning curve is the main motor for neverending fun of Matris. Lots of different modifications and built-in level editor asures the player that no matter how much he'd play, there's still an awful lot to discover.  Definitely recomended for all Lumines and Tetris enthusiasts, but also everybody that likes to challenge themselves!",
