This is the weak spot of Civ IV. You can stack like thousands of units in one tile. War becomes pure madness ✘Sometimes AI is too stupid. Building forts on oil. Yeah right, this is gonna work.

Other game companies should learn from Firaxis and open the source code of a part of their game so modders can really add new functionality without dumb hacks.  Other modding communities would do well to learn from the culture of modmodding in the Civ community, where people build upon the work of others and improve and refine it endlessly. A true community instead of a juxtaposition of bickering inflated egos.  It also wins my personal award for the most epic and fitting title screen music of all times, Baba Yetu.",

If you see this on sale with civ iv (which you need as BTS is not standalone) pick it up for the pure nostalgia feel. If you are new to the Civilization franchise, try Civ V and its expansions over this.   9/10 many many hours to be taken from this.

            "review_text": "While this is not a universal truth, I believe that a strategy game where only on strategy can be used to win is in essence: NOT a strategy game. The reality is that in Civlization IV vanilla, defence is kind of possible, but needs a LOT of effort and is not ultimatly worth it because your score point generation falls off the map while producing military units you will not use to take a capital/city.   However, in BTS this is even worse because defence is not even possible. You must research knights to counter catapults? wtf. The research is only like 1000 years apart. The only stategy available in Civ IV is: ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! If that is how I wanted to play then I would play a fricken RTS. (Real Time Strategy) Like AoM, Warcraft III, or Starcraft. The fact that this grind for military units is the only way to play makes all other parts of the game more like a dissapointing minigame you pursue while everyones LotR size hordes hump eachother in the field. If you pursue a science victory you essentially are achieving a military victory, but decided to make a spaceship while your nukes were in transit to your enemies loved ones.   So, once again I state: A strategy game with one strategy is not strategy game at all. Don't really want to be identified as a Civ V fan boy, but yes they fixed this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in Civ V and you can actually enjoy 5 different victory goals. (if you buy all the expansions that is, otherwise the vanilla game is the same meatgrinder of military units you wait on, while you fap or look at reddit) So, do not buy this game unless you want to have stacks of units slap eachother until one loses the strength to go on.   If you still want to buy this game, buy it on  {LINK REMOVED}  www.♥♥♥.com  for a $6 steam code intead of fricken $30-35 on steam, or what ever its up to now with the Civ VI announcement.  I am sorry Leonard Nimoy.",

Firaxis managed to hit a sweet spot between user friendliness and depth here which has not been replicated by any entry before or since, and if you have an interest in turn based strategy or simulation games, I really can't stress enough how badly you need to get this.  Then immediately go out and download the Fall From Heaven 2 mod for BTS. For the hoarde!  ",

From the vague memories I have, it was a lot of fun, but V was better in every way (after V got the expansions). I would play this all the time with my ex in college back then.   But for a real review, it's Civ, if you liked II, III, or I, you'll enjoy IV. It still has stacks of doom and is a fantastic game. However nowadays V is generally preferred and recommended. IV should only be played with all the expansions as well. If I were reviewing this 8-10 years ago, I'd probably rate it even higher, but there are better games out.  9.0/10",

They add money to the the forge's production modifier    Its a good one, not the best though, ill give that to the japanese, who can make a mystical ♥♥♥♥ing wall that trains their soldiers.     Or maybe that was the vikings? The man viking? Not boudica, but the other one.     Im pretty sure that boudica has a better harbor or something.     Im tired.",
