Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth  was a pleasant surprise due to its colorful cast and amusing storyline. The second Re;Birth game was a solid improvement. The third game was even better, but it was also more of the same. At the time, I thought that this RPG series was long overdue for a fresh take, but I started to worry that it would never happen. I envisioned that Compile Heart had grown complacent. They would continue to hammer these Neptunia RPGs out, all with slightly different storylines, five or twenty additional characters, and memes more 'dank' than ever thought possible. With the release of  Megadimension Neptunia V2 , Compile Heart has put my worries to rest. This is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series thus far.    The Story and Characters",

I shall now do one like I usually do with previous Nep games! :3  Normally, I would write a chunk in my review but this time, I'll 'try' to summarise it overall. Personally, Megadimension Neptunia VII is probably the best installment so far for the series along with RB1 and RB3 as my favourites. I'm actually surprised that despite the minimum requirements, I am able to run this on a Surface Pro 3. However, the newer dungeons, Dark CPU, NEXT Forms and animations for skills/EXEs were rather laggy. Everything else ran suitably enough to play. There are still a bunch of re-used dungeons from previous games but that does not matter. Monsters seem to be different, more variety and some are re-colours. In regards to gameplay, I liked how they tried to make it more challenging in a way such as the one dungeon with no map and only those in battle get EXP which may cause underlevels for some late game. I quite liked the hidden treasures, figurine/card collector achievements. It gives the game a new touch for not being as repetitive. Uniquely, I think they were also added to balance out the grindy achievements such as the good ol' classic lily rank achievements we've been getting the past installments which are much easier to max in VII. I liked the new soundtrack, the CG that is avaiable and reading the events to know more about the characters. One memorable one I'm quite fond of is the matching hats event between Histy and Uzume ^^ Other miscellaneous things I liked were the costumes and accessories, in particular IF and Compa as they finally have another outfit!  Would I nepping recommend this? If you're a nep fan, played a previous nep game then yes. If you're new I'd say, give it a go! Though I'm not sure if you should start with this one. Personally I would say to try RB1 to know what this game is about and it's concept. If not, then start with RB3 ^^",

Every enemy (that can speak) is voiced.  Combo system is freaking amazing. Better than ever before. Uzume is a total badass. Nep is, as usual, adorable. Bath scene pretty early on. Second (bettter) bath scene later. A lot of high quality voiced scenes.  Badass cutscenes. Amazing soundtrack. Absolutely wonderful. WILL BE VENUS is a personal favorite. New exe system is awesome and not OP anymore. Activating HDD always feels so good. The animations are so good. And if you wanna nep up, you gotta work for your HDD. Noire is as wonderful as ever. Uzume has a really nice butt. Formation skills force you to keep moving during battles. Keeps em faster paced than before, while still requiring some element of strategy. No 4th wall. A new kind of battle that I won't spoil, but I'm just gonna say it was PERFECTLY executed.  Superb story so far. Histoire knows about the memes.  They know about Nep x Noire fanart. 'Pictures of CPUs spanking eachother. Gross!' - Noire 2016 Wonderful voicing on the menu. 'I'm gonna die. I'm SERIOUSLY GONNA DIEEEEE!!!' - Nep 2016  Final verdict? As a unique kind of reviewer, I rate games based on what kind of game it is and what it tries to be. As a JRPG, I give it a 9.5 Absolutely wonderful. There are a few restrictions in place as part of the story, so I can respect that, but I feel like somethings could have been executed slightly better. There are also some lag issues. But hey, as a port from the PS4, that's to be expected. But over all, a WONDERFUL game. As a Nep game, an easy 10/10. This is easily the best Neptunia game yet. My play time (as of yet) easily reflects that.  Buy this game. You NEED to buy it if you love Neptunia. If you are just a simple RPG fan, try this game out. You are very likely to fall in love.  And remember. Nep responsibly. I certainly have not. I'm going to bed.",

            "review_text": "For those of you completely new to the series and the world of Neptunia, it is a hybrid turn-based JRPG and Visual Novel-esque game. The story elements are told with a mixture of fully voice acted and dialogue on screen style text boxes. The majority of the time the characters in a scene appear as static images on the screen with facial expressions changing to suit the mood of the character. There are a few full-motion videos mixed in, but they are not common.  In Megadimension Neptunia VII if you just quest run on the fairly linear track, you will actually miss quite a bit of the game. The scout system is back again, which unlocks new optional dungeons for you to explore as well as give you random items and credits. To give you encouragement and reasons to explore, the Guild system will issue you mostly optional quests. These quests help you in attaining credits, items and also increase your shares (power) for a faction. You can also invest in your home cities as well. Spending your hard earned credits to upgrade the city will cause new items to be sold in stores, give you more patterns to develop better gear, or raise your shares. You can also custom design your own power-ups too by fabricating discs with up to three different elements. Hidden treasures are available as well which act like challenges. There are even collectables available for you to try your luck with. I can tell you, Super Rare collectables really are super rare!  The gameplay involves a team of up to four (optionally supported with an additional team of up to four waiting on the sidelines) doing quests as they explore the area they are in. When in a dungeon, you can see the monsters/enemies roaming around which gives you the option to either fight them or try to sneak past them. In combat, the turns are displayed of the screen to give you an idea of who will be coming up next and if the next move is yours or the enemies. On your turn you can wander around within your movement range and then attack anything that falls inside your rotatable hitbox. You string together combos until the enemy is dead. Combos are set outside of battle and what combos will be available are determined by your character’s level and what weapon they have equipped at the time. Careful crafting of combos outside of battle allows you to make most of your attacks critical hits rather than regular hits. As an alternative to just attacking the enemy you can also spend Skill Points to cast magic/abilities. These high powered abilities can buff you, debuff/status effect the enemy, heal you, or do higher damage to the enemy. Additionally, the EXE gauge will fill as you take damage or you attack (especially if you use Rush combos). EXE lets you do a few things. You can cast an even more powerful attack as the most basic option. You can have your characters team up in a formation attack where they all interact and take turns attacking the enemy (all while counting as only one move). You can also have your character team up with the character supporting them in the reserves to do a coupling attack. Using EXE also lets you super charge some of your characters allowing them to take on a much more powerful form. For the Gold Third characters, you can enter their Gold Power mode, for the CPUs, you can go to their Next Gen form, which is a transformation for their transformation! The main CPUs and CPU Candidates also have abilities which are affected by the number of shares you currently have as well, so having high shares means the attack is more effective.  Besides the Next Gen Form and Golden Powers, there are a few new features added to this game that were not present in the previous entries. There is now a timer element and instant death mechanic in play while visiting a Neplunker dungeon. Instead of being safe when standing on a precipice, one wrong move will get you killed. Also coming in contact with most things will also kill you.. Making it to the end will get you a powerful reward making the effort worth it. Another new feature is the pocket dimension that is sometimes used. Uzume can use her special power to create a Sharing Field. Inside the Sharing Field you can battle giant enemies. You don’t have access to your melee ranged attacks or abilities, but you do have a trickle of SP regeneration while in the field. Hoping from platform to platform allows you to spread your team out in order to more easily trigger formation attacks as well as make it harder to be wiped out. It also makes it harder to revive your fallen companions so you really need to figure out what strategy will work best for you.  Character customization has always been a strong point in the Neptunia series. New weapons actually look different, often extremely different than the weapon the character was previously equipped with. While armor isn’t really noticeable outside of CPU form, clothing can be changed to suit your tastes. Most of the clothing involves cosmetic changes only, but some of them actually will increase your stats a little as well.   I never like spoiling a story for a game, but I do have to talk about the story a little here. The reason why this game is called Megadimension and not just Hyperdimension like its predecessors is the fact the game spans three separate dimensions. The first act serves as an excellent introduction to the gameplay and shows off all the basic mechanics for the game. The second act gives you a “Choose your Own Adventure” style choice system. You can basically pick which of the four stories you want to play first, second, third and last. All the stories take place at roughly the same time so there is some information bleed over that occurs between them which some might consider spoiling events of that other yet to be played option. It makes it a nice touch because it keeps the worlds from seeming completely isolated from each other while at the same time allows the game to play out four whole story arcs simultaneously. The final act of the trilogy ties together the first two acts and carries you on to one of the three endings.   There are a few common elements shared between all the Hyperdimension games. Other than the characters, the enemies carry over as well. It makes perfect sense that the same enemies will be battled in each of the games as they are all set in the same location, the Hyper dimension. New enemies naturally pop up in each new installment of the game, but the familiar ones are very welcome as well including the series long running villain Arfoire. The enemies are all voiced in Megadimension Neptunia VII as well, and their dialogue changes based on how well they are doing in battle. Another element that is shared between the games are the dungeon layouts. While this makes sense, again same dimension, it is a little unfortunate that the exact same layouts of dungeons are reused so often between games and within the game itself.  So should you get it? If you are fan of the Hyperdimension main series, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not picking it up. It is the fourth game in the main series after all. The gameplay is basically similar to its predecessors, at least the Re;Birth incarnations, but it has a whole new story with new and returning familiar characters. If you are new to the series, you might want to start with Re;Birth2 (story arc start) or at least Re;Birth3 so you will be able to get the references back to the previous games. Regardless of your choice, Neptune does a good job filling the player in with the details of who each of the returning characters are and what they are all about. Any references to the previous games can be chocked up to lore in other games, where they talk about happenings that “took place” before the game started. Megadimension Neptunia VII will still make a great entry point into the series as it is probably one of the best Neptunia games to date.",

            "review_text": "I picked up the Neptunia series a little less than four months ago, and I have to say--this is the best one out of all the games that I've played yet. Although I've barely scratched the surface, I am loving what I am seeing so far. It is on the path to becoming a favourite vidya of mine. I'd highly recommend this: it's as close as you will get to finding a 'perfect game'.   Pros/Cons I have noticed so far:  (+): Running on a somewhat dated AMD graphics card and processor (absolutely disgusting, I know) in 45-60fps and high video quality. This is impressive given how I could not do this with Re;Birth 1 or 2--a good testament to how this is a pretty good modern port.  (+): Continuity of certain relationships/certain arcs of the earlier games. It's suffice to say that this latest edition restores/retains many of the relationships from the previous games (my favorite, Nep and Noire; the sisters; Nepgear and Uni; etc). It also retains the elements of story people may have liked from 1 or 2, while not necessarily retconning or confirming others. It just leaves controversial parts of certain previous games unmentioned. In my opinion, this is a good take on how to deal with loose ends [unresolved arcs] when adding a new game to your series.  (+): Pretty effective new chars.; pretty effective perosnas for each one.  (+): One of the first things I noticed is that the dialogue is much less long-winded than the  previous games. The conversations featured in the game convey their main point concisely, and even manage to add some filler into each one without feeling superfluous.   (+): Holds many clever parallels and/or references to the first game which I certainly enjoyed. This undoubtedly holds some significance to the story, too.   (+): Impressive visuals comparative to other games in the series, and in general. I particularly enjoyed what they did with the character models during conversation scenes. Compile Heart REALLY committed to sharpening the models of each character, and I love it.  (+): Like the previous games, this holds a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of fan service. But you're probably well aware of this, too, if you are browsing this series in the first place.  (+): Kick ♥♥♥ musical score  (+): Glorious yuri overload   (+): Large, original, and fairly pretty maps/reskins. I'm around 15% in, and its 75% original; 25% reskin.  (biggest pro/con): There is no fourth wall. Take that as you will.  (minor con): Takes a while for the story to officially ignite. It took around 40 minutes for me to become fully engaged.   I'll come back to this and edit as I progress with the story.  Update: True Ending improves the game A LOT. I was already really satisifed and considering it a favorite game of mine even with a lesser ending. After that though, I'd say I'm satisifed enough to 100% this game, which I generally never do with games. Additionally, the prerequisites to achieving it are less convoluted or understated compared to the previous games. I think fans of the series like myself will be very happy with it.",

Lots of nice pudding. Mainly for gameplay, the battles feel much more engaging and the world feels tons more alive with the route system. The giant battles and the transformation sequences feel satisfying and make you feel powerful as well, which is a massive plus.  I've been a fan of Neptunia since the release of Hyperdimension V and I thought the cast of V was it. It was their best moment and none of the side releases like U or Hyperdevotion Noire could amass to what they've accomplished. But Idea Factory and Compile Hearts delivers to impress on VII with an even BETTER cast and even more characters to love.  Who ever thought that since on release, that the dodgy original Hyperdimension Neptunia series for the PS3 would spawn such a large fanbase with such a niche but smart target audience?  I'm probably just fanwhoring at this point but I do support people buying this game and hope they can have the same enjoyment that I had with it. Maybe for context, you would want to buy Re;Birth 3 first, but as a standalone, VII can be lovable as well.  NepNep/10",

You don’t really need knowledge of the world of Neptune either, thankfully, as it gives you little 4th wall breaking moments when issues come up that you would need to know about. I recommend this game, honestly, but ONLY to fans of Neptunia, or this genre in general. This is not going to convert someone to liking JRPGs, it’s only for the diehard fans.  The story is completely nuts, akin to a 'Crack Anime' with talking handsome fish, bizarre bug monsters, dimension hopping and so on. Combat is solid but has some crazy difficulty spikes, and the game is a visual treat. Overall, I can recommend it but again, only for diehard fans of the series or JRPGs in general.",

Now, in December, I finally decided to start playing again, regardless. I fell victim to the crashes, losing a bit of progress, forcing me to spend less time enjoying and grinding dungeons, but more time trying to find a save point before I crashed again.  This review isn't so much on the game (which is really good, by the way. Best in the series.), but an awareness post for people looking to enjoy some Nep-Nep, but can't get past the crashing.

Since most people already know what they're getting into by checking out a Neptunia game, I'll just focus my review on the things that stand out from previous releases for me...   The port works quite fine, runs at constant 60fps except for minor stuttering when transitioning scenes in general in my case, not really bothersome since these transitions usually occur with a fade to black or fade to white, eg: in-game to VN mode, or back to game, or when you press the Enter dungeon button you'll notice a slight pause before the game goes to load the level.  The Soundtrack is really good, with all known BGMs from other games and really cool additions ('Encounter of Destiny' so OP).  Regarding the game, it's more Nep! So I have no objections with that, without spoiling the story too much (already beaten it a few times in PS4) I'll say it manages to strike a better balance between comedy and drama than ReBirth 2, it knows exactly when to stop taking itself seriously, that's a good thing. Giant boss battles are entertaining, though one might say there are few of them, they come at the right moments to make them meaningful. They also brought back CPU transformation cutscenes, when you activate HDD form, you're treated to a short cutscene of waifu's transformation into CPU, never skipping those, they're so damn cool!  Combat is a bit more streamlined, the basics are there, you have up to 5 hits per turn, but there's no more Guard Break mechanic so the Break attacks are now named 'Standard' and fill a middle ground between Power attacks damage and Rush attacks EXE drive fill. Combo length is now affected by the weapon the character is holding, each weapon has a first attack of one fixed type (Rush, Power or Standard) and then it has one or more combo slots in each type of hit (eg: you can have a weapon with 1 fixed Rush slot, and following it 1 more Rush, and in parallel 2 Power and 4 Standard slots). In addition many attacks have a 'combo trait', which gives your next hit additional damage when you fulfil the combo trait condition for it. Sort of replacing the Guard Break mechanic, you now have some monters which have breakable body parts, these are usually located and can only be attacked from a specific side of the monster (ie: back, left side, right side, etc), this gives a somewhat tactical approach to combat, since breaking parts can help by reducing one monster's defense, as well as negating the use of certain skills on some others, sadly once you start overleveling the dungeon monters by a tiny bit this is no longer really needed, but it's an interesting system to develop further in sequels (yes please give me MOAR NEP)  There are also leveling and lily rank system changes, regarding leveling, only your front row characters will get experience from fights, this can look like downer compared to previous games, rest assured though, again trying to not spoil too much, you'll hardly have a party of more than 4 characters during your first playthrough, and by the time you have a full roster, you can easily create game discs with the Racing idea chip, which allows characters to gain exp when not in the front line (gives the 'Learning' ability). Lily rank has also seen some changes, like exp, lily rank is now increased between all members of the front row once you finish a battle, as opposed to the previous front+back row pair system. Previous lily rank increasing actions between characters still work though, such as buffing, healing one ally or allies, using items on allies, and also switching the front row character with the back row coupled one will increase lily rank between them.  Last but not least, this is the first Neptunia game I felt like being 'harder' than the others, midway through the game you'll notice you are tossed into the world being underleveled for the mobs you have to fight, so it will require some grinding and good use of combo traits, skills and whatnot, it's not something that will take a huge amount of time though, it lasts long enough to make it challenging and not boring, suffice to say, if you got the DLC weapons this does not apply at all to your playthrough.   TL;DR  Wasn't expecting to write this wall of text, but I guess you can see I really DO recommend this game, it's a good step forward for the series, although it might not be trying to do a lot of new stuff, it's still refreshing enough to go back Nep'n around Hyperdimension and its companion universes :P",

            "review_text": "I've been following the Neptunia series for a long time and was bummed that I couldn't play Megadimesion since I didn't have a PS4, so I was pretty happy about there being a PC port. Outside of small freezes/pauses occasionally when loading dialog, and frame drops on certain parts of maps, this was the best Neptunia port I've played.  I think the first part of the game's 'trilogy' was the best Neptunia experience I've had. I've always been annoyed at the fact that Neptunia games tend to reuse a LOT of old content, to the point where sometimes playing new versions of the game felt like you were playing the same game as before. In the first part, 'Zero Dimension,' you were put in a different world with new maps and much nicer looking enviornments, characters, and mobs. In addition, the character sprites were updated for everyone and they look pretty good. Zero Dimension had small events between main story events where characters you knew interacted with newer characters and the new world around them, and felt very refreshing. There was actually some difficulty as well at the first part (for a Neptunia game) that made the combat system feel enjoyable. The second part feels very SLOW (especially if you don't particularly like certain CPUs), and the third part feels really short and really lacking. The story's quality degrades and the gameplay transforms into spamming skills on bosses to win. Old maps start coming back which REALLY contrast with the visually updated characters and mobs, and it doesn't help that they often have lower frames than the shinier new maps somehow.  Overall, the game had some interesting new features and changes, although not all were very good. Instead of the old 'select a location to go from the map' style, you now have a route system where you must build routes with credits to dungeons found either by 'scouts' (similar to victory's Stella's dungeon) or found through the story events. This sounds cool and kinda is, but can be VERY annoying with long paths because of random fights with low level mobs that feel like a complete waste of time. There is also Parts Break, which was cool for one fight only in the main story but overall felt very pointless and was underutilized. The combat system was changed so that there were no guards, and instead all the different 3 attacks could 'combo,' which was more interesting than spamming X until guards broke then spamming something else. Investing was cool but felt really lacking, and quests were lessened but lengthened so that you could easily have a quest that required you to kill the same mob 8-10 times.  I think the game was a fairly good port overall, and the changes were mostly positive. I think that the great experience of the first part really makes up for the latter two parts enough for the game to be considered good.",

The story is a continuation from HDN Victory/Rebirth 3: V Gen so a must buy for those after the actual story.  Gameplay wise, its been revised to a completely new mechanic while retaining the turn-based elements we have gotten used to. We must not forget the increased fanserive from our girls. The visuals have gotten a lot better considering it is a PS4 game. I have no issues with the game so far.

            "review_text": "Now that I've played the game more extensively, I can make an actual review. This is going to be a long one.  Now, I know that this game is supposed to be a complete overhaul of all the mechanics and elements that made the franchise brilliant. And believe me, it's an overhaul alright. The graphics are nicer, the level design is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant compared to the Re;Birth trilogy (which is what I'm comparing it to), and the main characters are even more fleshed out than ever before, which I like. The soundtrack is nice as well; some of these tracks are actually pretty amazing.  That said, there is one major problem with this game. I... didn't have as much fun with it as I did with the Re;Birth series. I'll go through the major issues, which combined, make this game a bit lacklustre, at least to me.  - The first is the difficulty. It ♥♥♥♥ing slides about like a wet turd on a teflon floor. The first two areas of the game are nice and easy, then the enemies suddenly gain stats that are about three times as high as the ones just before. This is a ridiculous difficulty spike and it really threw me off when I first got to that third area (and I've finished the entire Re;Birth trilogy so I should be pretty good). Unfortunately, this trend continues throughout the game. Some bosses are easy, some are challenging, but then others are downright cheating (I'm looking at you, K-Sha, you multi-turn, million shots per attack ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). The difficulty of the game flipflops like crazy throughout the whole game and it's not really fun to work around.  - The storyline is not nearly immersive or expansive enough for the story it's trying to tell. Two of the antagonists you see throughout the second part of the game, they're pretty big and important in that bit. Then at the beginning of the third chapter you just defeat them. That's it. THAT'S IT. THEY ARE SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERS AND YOU JUST... DEFEAT THEM. Yeah there's a bit of unnecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the whole 'NEXT' thing, but seriously? The way they portray the whole third chapter, it's like they were never threats at all. This is just one example. Blanc's route during the second chapter is 70% EXPOSITION. The remainder is just bosses and the worst areas in the entire game. There are so many issues with the story that it's barely even worth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on, and that's a shame, because it could have been REALLY good.  - After literally more than a dozen games, some of which are spinoffs, you'd think, you'd just THINK, that they'd bother to put more effort into their cutscenes than they do. They're identical to the cutscenes from the old games, which I find is just plain laziness more than anything else. I don't quite understand why these games take over a dozen gigabytes when the cutscenes, which take up about a third of the game in total, are just slighty animated portraits with some facial movement... and text. Just text. Admittedly there is a higher percentage of voice-acting in this one, which is great because I love the voices of the characters. It's just that they're still recycling exactly the same style and sprites for these scenes without any innovation.  - And the bosses. The ♥♥♥♥ing combat in general is a near-perfect carbon copy of any other Neptunia game, which is REALLY DISAPPOINTING. The only new mechaninc are the giant fights, of which I experienced two of them, and both of which were in the first chapter, and are never brought up again. BOOOOORIIIING. I want at least some innovation, please, is that too much to ask? But I digress. One new mechanic in the boss battles is the multiple health bars thing. BUT IT'S POINTLESS. They only exist to give a false sense of progression through a boss battle, and nothing EVER makes use of them. WHY HAVE THEM AT ALL? Some major bosses also have some quote they'll utter when they hit half health, but nothing else ever happens, so why bother? The difficulty problem also applies - some bosses are ♥♥♥♥ easy and do barely anything, while others ♥♥♥♥ING NUKE YOUR ASSES OFF THE PLANET. Why have bosses with nukes? That's just cheap. And don't even get me started on K-Sha.  I got the bad ending on the first run, which is good, because if I get the bad one then I like that it's because I didn't fulfil the requirements for the good one. The problem with the bad ending is that the already short story just... stops. Abruptly, and with the whole 'we're all going to die' vibe. That whole bad end just sums up the game really. It's just that in comparison to the Re;Birth games, this is just a bit on the disappointing side.  That all being said, I still had SOME fun with it, just not as much as the old games. I can still recommend it, especially if you've not played the Re;Birth trilogy, but if you want something better, just get those.",

Edit: OKAY THAT WAS WRITTEN AS A JOKE AFTER WATCHING THE OPS BUT LET ME STRESS THAT IF YOU WANT A TL;DR, THAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO READ IF YOU GET THE REFERENCES.  Okay, serious review. I've played only up to the first boss since I bought it yesterday and I have to say that I already recommend it. Let's go over a few things.  Graphics: 7-9/10 I dunno if the engine or the way the game is rendered has changed, but I seem to have trouble running it without being on the lowest settings on my laptop smoothly when on the battle map. However, I was able to run Victory/V-Generation perfectly fine without any problems. The game still looks beautiful though. +1 for new Histy story sprite. Seems to be a mixture of map details + enemies, some maps I can run smoothly, some maps I can't.  Music: OMGWTFAWESOME-13/10 Had me from the OP. Background music seemed to be something they really revamped and caught my attention much more easily. A few nostalgic tracks are in there, but YES, it's good.  Story: Can't rate yet, but from what I've played so far, already gripped me and not just for NepuNepu's adventurers.  Edit: STORY IS 10/10, characters you think about make an appearance and also the underlying mystery present in the game along with some of the early twists captivated me and even though I'm hardly past the first major boss battle, I find myself wanting to discover more. An amusing and well-put cast already, looking forward to advancing through the game.  Battle Mechanics/Gameplay:  Standard world map in battle zones. New world map is a little rough to get used to, but I feel like I'll adapt to it right away. As for battle mechanics, I LOVE the overhaul. No more is it just 'pick your most powerful attack/attack that eats up most CP and spam'. Attacks now boost other attacks based on what came before them, so you can strategize about what moves to place and where. The new EXE gauge attacks aren't nearly as exploitable plus battlefield positioning because much more important.  NepuNepu: MAX/10 It has NepuNepu. GO GET IT IF YOU LOVE NEPUNEPU D:",

This can even happen to some users with AMD cards, from reports on the forum. - The game is horribly optimized and will also crash many integrated Intel GPUs that are otherwise more than capable of running the game, in particular one long dungeon very early in the game called Sakura Park. - The game is lacking a Japanese-only balance patch that fixes glaring oversights regarding the game's combat system and scaling, namely with activated skills and EXE drives (aka. hypers) falling off into complete uselessness past the early game. - There is frequent stuttering and delay within the menus that can lead to crashes, especially with one of the graphics cards mentioned above. One of the July patches that IFI released helped the problem and made the stuttering far less noticeable, but it still happens.  However, the abandonment of this game by the devs is particularly concerning, as IFI has done this once in the past. A previous game in the series, Neptunia Re:Birth2, saw IFI completely drop support for it while the game suffered from constant crashes, rolled back several problematic attempted fixes, and then did nothing for the rest of the game's lifespan. It still has not been patched.  Overlooking the problems, Neptunia VII is a surprisingly good RPG with a long and indepth (if silly and whimsical) storyline, decent humor, and moderately challenging fights. I have been a fan of the series for years, but VII's abandonment by its developers in spite of its balance issues and lack of stability means I can't easily recommend this to anyone looking for a complete experience, especially not with this pricetag.",

This game to me has been longer than Re;birth 3 which took me roughly 50 hours to beat, but I was boosted by the Histoire EXP pack which carried me through the game quicker. However since I couldn't find a DLC for this game, it took me a lot longer to complete which made me really like the game for what it is instead of having DLC carry me to the end.  I like the introduction to both Uzume and Big Neptune. I'd say Big Neptune had a bigger introduction because Uzume at the start was very hostile towards Small Neptune but they quickly got along very fast after a few battles.  Zero Dimension was honestly a lot of fun, exploring the newly added dungeons was great, filled with a lot of detail and stuff. In Rebirth 1 to 3, dungeons were at least 2 floors or 2 areas to complete, in this new game, it's more than that so you have a lot more to explore. There's less copy and pasting in this game as well which is great.  Some dungeons keep the same theme but are generally layed out differently so even if the theme is the same, the direction of going somewhere is completely new. After playing all 3 Rebirth games, I'm glad I wasn't playing copy and paste dungeons all the time.  Golden DImension was absolutely interesting as it took all 4 characters a chapter of their own. Neptune, Blanc, Noire and Vert are the protagonists. Instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company characters (Like Tekken), it introduces 4 new characters, C-Sha, B-Sha, E-Sha, K-Sha and S-Sha which all represents genres instead of companies. I'm not going to spoil these characters too much other than that.  Heart Dimension was a really good chapter, but I'll leave that all to you. I think it's best not to spoil you here.  Let me just remind you though, when you have the chance, grind as much as you can, because this game is tough, but it's worth it.  Time to get the true ending/",

Production values here are great and totally surprised at the improvement to the music. The opening music for the third chapter is now one of my favorite JRPG songs!   Worth every penny. I recommend not buying the DLC and reading up on True Ending so you don't have to play game over twice. Another Hit in the Neptunia series! Buy it NOW!",

            "review_text": "Alright this is a direct sequel to Hyperdimension Neptunia re;birth 3/Victory (a lot of people say otherwise but piecing together chirper events it's about the same time difference from Sisters Generation to Victory), about 4 years have passed since the events of the Ultradimension and they really wanted to enter the next-gen with a bang and they did a pretty damn good job doing it.  To sum it up they've improved most things in the franchise, dungeons are more complex and not just copy &amp; pasted, enemy variety is expanded a little bit, a beneficial combo system and revamped EXE system, a new development system and more interactions with the nations and a more in depth look at everyone involved in this story and this story has a serious tone to it while keeping the comedic charm and pulls it off really well.  PROS +Great Soundtrack +Improved combat system +Greatly improved graphics and smoothed out animations +A much deeper story than the other games in the franchise +Pudding +A lot of character development with a lot of characters actually developing +The story keeps a good pace +First playthrough, not using DLC puts this on par with Neptunia 1's difficulty +Sound effects aren't nearly as loud as the previous games +New 'Break' system in combat +The True Ending  CONS -No playable Ploot or P-ko (Plutia and Peashy) -The human cast does not return sadly. So no M#GES, 5pb., Cave, Brocolli, Falcom(s), RED, CyberConnect2 etc. (Compa and IF do return though along with a smaller, but newer DLC human set) -I get a weird loud popping sound every once in a great while -Uni attracts weird men -Minor graphical glitches sometimes -Minor grammar errors every once in a great while (Like God Eater Chan's spell healing 30 and not '30%') --If you bought all the DLC for whatever reason when your cast rejoins you at various points in the story they are automatically equipped with the broken DLC gear (but in NG+ if you keep everyone it does not auto-gear anyone anymore)  NEUTRAL (Some things I like and disliked but didn't fit in pros and cons) /Investment system is difficult the first time through, Millionep even only goes so far /Development feels kind of weird especially since it's not based on the MB system anymore /Scouts are something to get used to /Share system /EXP is not shared across the party anymore making it easier to learn about chaarcters from the ground up but at the same time you can't throw them into any battle you wish if their underleveled /Monster ambushes are quiet /Map battle encounters and safe zones",

Another thing that need seriously to be patched is the damages that the exe drives deal.Exe drives are supposed to be the finisher move of each character and its just ridicolous that in the game we get to deal more damages with normal combos of how much we deal with a finisher considering that the Exe drives have a big delay as well.The Japanese version of the game received a patch for it on ps4 to set back exe drives to be more powerful of normal combos attacks and i really hope to see a patch for that as well here on steam cause that kills the game variability to use each combos to fill exe drives and exe drives to deal damages.  Aside that,i will give the review a positive feedback and i suggest it to all the fans of this series but those problems seriously NEED a patch.",
