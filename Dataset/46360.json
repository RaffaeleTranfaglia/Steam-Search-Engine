IMHO, this is not just another WW2 tactical game, it is the MOST REALISTIC simulator of company-level battles of 1943-1951 warfare! Not easy to master for everyone who is used to 'select'em all -&gt; send'em all!' tactics! Every shell and armor interaction follows real physics laws, every unit moves are done in the real scale (time and distances), all battles are very intense and make you feel that this is how it was for real! Every wargamer eager for WW2 realism must try at least!",
