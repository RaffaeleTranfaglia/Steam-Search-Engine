I've spent a lot of time trying to get this game to work by other means, so seeing it working properly on steam is quite a relief.   This game is pretty much exactly the same as when it was released, haven't noticed any bugs as of yet, and it seems to run smoothly. It's a hard sidescrolling space shooter, with 3 different terrains and 3 different difficulties.",
