            "review_text": "If you enjoyed other Choice of Games titles then I recommend not wasting your time. Not only does Heroes Rise take out the 'Choice' aspect by graying out options based on what they've streamlined you into to begin with, they also take out the 'Game' as well, railroading you down a series of unavoidable plot devices changed in an almost imperceptible way via what rare choice you can make that has any effect.   Possibly the worst part of the game, however, is the main character who either has to be Lawful Stupid or Chaotic Stupid depending on your options. You never choose the right options and often find yourself bumbling about leaving a trail of disasters no matter how hard you try or how perfectly you play the game.   Last but not least is the villain which, avoiding any spoilers, literally has to give you a Powerpoint presentation of the evil plan. I'm a huge fan of Choice of Games as well as well as comic book heroes, but you're likely best off buying a different one if you actually want to participate in the story.",

            "review_text": "I bought the Heroes Rise trilogy while it was on sale after greatly enjoying the Choice of the Deathless demo (which I still plan to buy). Most of my childhood was spent in the 1990s, so I was able to experience the actual 'choose your own adventure' novels that were popular back when bookstores still actually existed. At the time, I actually didn't care for them. Nearly every one I read would have ridiculous consequences for choices that seemed logical; your character could die because of a sound choice you made, just because the author wanted to trick you out of a decision. That was my one concern going into the Choice of Games library of games. That, and whether the story would actually suck me in.  It did. Let me just say I'm not a huge superhero fan. Sometimes I watch the movies, and most of the time I'll play the games associated with various Marvel and DC characters. But I tend to find heroism too black and white to be practical, and tend to be far more interested in the villains of such stories, so I was a little worried this story wouldn't keep my attention. I read this interactive novel from start to finish in one three hour sitting, however, because it didn't shy away from keeping you actively involved in the outcome of certain events. You even get to make small decisions about what your character looks like that I did catch repeated later, helping you stay immersed (i.e. you get to choose what color your 'energy' is, and I noticed the game would describe this later on in fights).  Is it written well? For the most part, yes. I noticed some misspellings that could be attributed mostly to typos, and for some reason, the author here has a significant bias against using commas before the conjunction 'but' that I noticed popped up multiple times throughout my playthrough. Are the mistakes noticeable? Yes. Are they game or immersion breaking? No. All in all, I noticed about ten errors over the course of a three hour interactive novel, which isn't too bad of a balance.  Is the story any good? Yes. It's mostly a story about going from a nobody to a superhero in a futuristic, arguably dystopian society. The world is just as corrupt as its criminals, with a justice system that crosses the boundaries of reason, technology that is far too incorporated into human life than is safe, and laws that are questionable. You are able to choose where your beliefs lie in this mix, and I was pleased to see I was able to choose a path that wasn't just righteously heroic or immorally anti-heroic. You can also decide what your beliefs are early on and divert from them later, if you so choose, but the game will punish you for this diversion. Throughout the story you are able to choose what sexual orientation you have and you are also able to choose to romance one (or more) of a few characters. Even though I chose relatively early on to romance one character (and had a teen-rated romance scene with said character), I was still given the choice to profess feelings for another later on, so choices hadn't been taken away from me just because I'd already chosen someone else.  With that said, there were some choices that didn't quite make sense or that I made that in the end, didn't really matter. (I'll keep this spoiler-free.) It was revealed to me that a character I cared about had a pretty shocking secret, and I had to choose whether to be okay with this new information and accept the character with their flaws or not. I chose to say that I understood and was okay with it--and despite this, my character decided on her own to stop talking to this person and ignore all attempts of communication from them. In the end, it did end up that this could work out the way I had wanted it to begin with, but the story ended up deciding for me how my character felt despite me telling her to feel otherwise, which broke the immersion a bit. There's also a clear trust violation committed against you by a main character, and even though they explain it was done for your benefit (and you have the choice to refute that), you still end up giving into their whims and doing what they've wanted you to do all along, which really irked me. The story ended up telling me that my character just knew 'it was right', and I honestly didn't agree. Because I had created this character to mimic my beliefs, to see her going against them angered me a bit and made me question the influence of some of my decisions.  Overall, this was a well-written game that gave me more choices than I anticipated, and most of them made sense. Quite a few of them mattered quite a bit (for example, characters in this CAN die). I admired the author for steering clear of the goofy superhero format and sticking with the gritty, more realistic superhero formula that won't shy away from killing characters or having true consequences to actions. Although I was a bit disappointed in the mostly uninteresting villains this game had to offer, the heroes themselves had enough downfalls in their personalities to keep me intrigued in their character development. Because I got three hours out of one playthrough, I think the game is worth its full price even if you'll only go through it once (though, of course, there is massive replay value here). If I had to give it a rating, I would give Heroes Rise: The Prodigy an 8/10. This is a great game at a great price that will grab your attention and hold onto it until it concludes in an epilogue, and it should not be missed.",

There are no graphics, it's completely text based and yet I don't feel like it needed them anyways. The story and the emphasis on the choices you make is absolutely enthralling. I normally don't sit down and finish a game, I'll put it off till later and eventually get to it- not the case with this game and it's sequel.I stayed up until 4 am (started this one in the evening) just to get to the conclusion of both games. Overall the time to do one run of this game is about 4 hours. But there's definite grounds to justify replaying this game- there are so many choices to make after all. Overall great game, and I'm really looking forward to the third game in this series!",

Buuuuut Its way to linear most of the timee and most of the choices tend to be unclear. Making you guess, hoping for a good outcome. There also were times when I was like 'I don't want to do it like this, this is wrong!' But I had no other choice.  Not the best 'choice of games' game out there for sure.",

I'd have to say it is more of an interactive novel than a choose your own adventure, if you can understand my distinction between the two. Some choices seem 'not to matter' but actually affect your stats which in turn can affect your Legend score at the end of the game.  Some people will be disappointed that they can't decide what powers they get or what their background is, but that is what I meant by an interactive novel. This is part of a series with a plot which can seem a bit more rigid than some of the other Choice of Games. I don't feel this should stop you if you enjoy the idea of superheroes and a setting with a decent enough background.  Another complaint I have seen is somebody saying it was too 'dark' for them and they wanted something 'silly'. I don't think that part of their review warranted the downvote. In fact, if you can get past feeling led here and there, the story can be quite moving.   In the end, this is not as good as some of the other games from the same company. Maybe wait for it to go on sale if you aren't sure, though honestly it doesn't cost much.",

Visually, it stands proudly in the Interactive Fiction camp: a verdant land where graphical resolution is limited only by the imagination, and GPUs never melt. Mechanically though, it is much more similar to Visual Novels, as the player navigates using a series of multiple choice prompts to branch the story instead of a clunky text parser to repeatedly fail at picking up ye flask. What really makes the game shine, however, are the small mad-lib sprinkles. At several points the reader/player/whatever is given the choice between several descriptions for characters/things/whatever. In addition to the default options, there is a magical, wonderful text box.  This text box is what allows you to reject all of the suggested options, and have the sexy female hero/love interest (depending on the gender/orientation options you chose, presumably) look like Gary Busey.  The IF truly is stronger than the FPS.",

I can't finish it.  Also, what's with the use of the word 'slugger' as a curse and general excalamation? It's absurdly childish and not endearing in the least.

Some of the choices in this story don't feel fully flesh out, which results in some choices to feel completely ignored, no matter what choice you make. Which wouldn't be to bad, and I can see how it would save time during production, but as a player resulting in me reading the next page, 'well, that was pointless'.  The story sure takes its time to ramp up, and all the video game-ish mechanics being explained in a fictional world comes across weird. Instead of feeling 'warn out', you have a chip in your wrist that tells you that you are 'low on mana'. I feel like that could be kept within the story's boundaries and explained with just a few sentences.  I think I'm almost done with this book, but depending on the ending I may not start the second in the series. My character is kind of a push over hero, and a little too attached to her fame status. The Legend level thing also feels a little to RPG-ish for a fictional book world. Just let my Hero walk down the street and have someone want to take a selfie with her.
