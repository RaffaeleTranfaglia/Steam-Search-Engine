There is no manual or guide on what to do. The 4th hint tells you to build a road and cages but not how to do it. We finally go a couple of cages built and have 4 dinos in them. Now we just sit there waiting to clean up their ♥♥♥♥ and can't figure out how to do anything else. Boring and pointless.",
