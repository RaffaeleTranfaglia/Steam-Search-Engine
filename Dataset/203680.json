            "review_text": "Being a big fan of Sonic and All stars transformed racing decided to try out the Codemaster's version of kart racng. There are definitely big pros and cons to this game and I hope they decide to fix these areas in their future sequel if there ever will be one. Which I doubt since Grid series, their signature line up is doing extremly well. Which by the way am a BIG BIG fan of. Unlike other kart racing games there are almost little to no drifting! Which could be good and bad. Basically focrces you to pay more attention to lines you take in corner entry and exit. Some may find this annoying and others might appreciate the challenge.  Let's talk about the PROS of this game first  + Clean eye pleasing graphics + Car damage and pit system + Team play mode + Price if you can grab it at 75% (4.99) + Slip stream!!! (shake and bake)  Ok the downside....  - TOO MUCH DLC (seems to be becoming codemasters trend) - Online multiplayer is dead. You'll need to get your buddies to play - Weapons were not very creative  Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend buying this game to any silly kart racing fans out there then immediately adding ME!!!

            "review_text": "F1 Race Stars is  incredibly  shallow. For your full price you get a grand total of seven tracks with very little variation outside of them. It's a very fun splitscreen experience... that's better suited for a console. F1 Race Stars took plenty of chances but they didn't pay off and for full price you're going to be playing a flawed game that could have been more fun. This is made worse by the fact that the online is dead and the game has trouble reading multiple controllers at times. If you have four guys who'd like to play it and can get it really cheap on a sale, I'd say it  could  be worth a look at, but F1 Race Stars doesn't do anything for anyone outside of that small, situational demographic and that's just dissapointing.",

            "review_text": "Alright, so I'm pretty torn on this. I'd been waiting a long while, debating a long while on whether I wanted to get my hands on it, because it looked quite fun and silly and right up my alley, and it's from Codemasters, but the reviewers I normally trust noted frustrating difficulty with it. Having finally picked it up for a little under $4 USD, I think I can sum up all the problems with this game in one word: 'Arbitrary.'  There's an arbitrary elimination mode that's horribly unbalanced and basically just means the person in first at the beginning wins. There's an arbitrary shortcut system that requires you to find a key on the track and drive through a specific gate to basically win right off the bat. There's an arbitrary random interval of time between the '3, 2, 1' and the 'Go' to make boosting at the start that much harder (though honestly I found that kinda funny). There's an arbitrary damage system that slows your car down after each item that hits you, which serves only to force you to pit and to let those in the lead keep their lead. The whole freaking point of item racing is to keep it competitive, make it so that it's a constant fight for position based on skill. The gameplay mechanics routinely defeat their own purpose here. Hell, there's an item that   instantly teleports the user to lead position . How ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy is that, destroying the entire purpose? In a great deal of the career mode's races, I didn't feel any satisfaction whether I won or lost, feeling instead like I just ended up wherever the game decided.  Now, if you've read all of that and still want to give this game a try due to curiosity, sale price, a love of F1, or being charmed by the trailers,  then  I can recommend this to you. If you want a better racing game, you're spoiled for choice here, but Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is name-dropped so often for a reason. If you just want to check this in particular out on sale, then go ahead; you'll definitely get your $4 worth.  The course design is a major, major plus here. I'm not too familiar with F1, but I know a lot of the real tracks from other racing series, and especially racing games (and especially games by Codemasters, at that!). The KERS system encourages taking your time in sharp corners, meaning that places like Monaco and the mountain roads of Japan (because come on, it's a Japan course in a racing game) get to be twisty and winding without ruining momentum. Each course is a loving, cartoonish, theme park version of its setting, be it the country entirely or just the city, and national stereotypes are played for humor, creativity, and really exciting scenes. Racing on bullet trains in Japan, leaping through the castles of Germany, and battling in the factories of the UK are grand fun. As an American, I personally found the USA course to be absolutely adorable, and love the effort they put into these. The original courses are part of the design, of course, and it's quite impressive to see familiar sweeping curves recreated in the country's landscape. I will also have to give some points for sheer awesome value of Abu Dhabi starting with a back-to-back combo of Yas Marina and Ferrari World.  The character design is your usual exaggerated cartoony look, but the animation sells it. Seeing your driver put on their helmet a random way every single time you start the race livens up the usual countdown, much like the Battlefield games having those one-in-ten-thousand reload animations. I don't know the drivers all too well, but was able to find pretty much all of the ones I've heard of. The voice acting is serviceable, and playing mostly as Kimi Räikkönen, it took a while before I realized that every driver speaks their own home language with a peppering of English. It does add a good deal to the experience to hear an international field, even if a bit exaggerated in performance.  There is a massive amount of bloat in this game, from extraneous unfun game modes to a wealth of gameplay mechanics that are never, ever explained. The key and shortcut system is never once mentioned. Boosting at the start by pressing the pedal right at 'Go' is never mentioned. Boosting after a jump by hitting the gas the second you land is never mentioned. And so on, and so forth. You're gonna probably need a guide for this one.  The sense of speed honestly isn't too impressive outside of boosts. It doesn't really feel particularly like F1. It's the courses and the KERS system that really hammer home what it's based off of. All in all, it's absolutely goofy in a great way, but I mostly only recommend it to those out there that, say, would go into a game store and pick out a racing game from the bargain bin just to see what the experience is like, not for completionist's sake or out of serious hope it'll be a major timesink and investment. For the most part, I really was tempted to hit that 'Not Recommended' button. But I haven't stopped playing, so I think that answers that.",

            "review_text": "Mario Kart Clone?  Alright, i bought it and wanted a Mario Kart for PC... This is what I got: 21/25 Gameplay 14/15 Replayability 5/10 Fairness 6/10 Controls 9/10 Graphics 8/10 Sound 8/20 Multiplayer ----------------------------- 71/100  And here we go: In F1 Race Stars you get a game similar to Mario Kart. Same Power-Ups, same Gameplay. There is not much to say about these two points. But why does it just have 5 points in Fairness? The Damage System! If you get hit, you get damaged, if you get damaged twice you are half as fast as the others. And that until you reach the next Repair Boxes. And to drive into these you loose even MORE time! Unfortunately you can only turn off the Damage playing with friends.  This leads to the next point: Multiplayer. There is no working multiplayer in this game! Noone plays it, becuase the Match Making is bugged...But if your friends play it, you get a nice experience: you can choose everything- Damage, Power Ups, Special Things, Length... And then the game makes very very much fun! Unfortunately this game had no racing wheel support. Just controller support. But a good thing to say about it is that the Controls are pretty easy (WASD+Shift+Space+Alt) and that you can play this game in Co-Op mode with a splitscreen and on 1 computer. But you have to have a controller for each person you wanna play together with, just one person can use the keyboard. Because of the easy Controls, the Replayability is very good. Also this game has very many game modes, a campain with several cups on several roads and a quick race mode. I took away 1 point because of the eventual Rage Quits because of the (Un)Fairness. The Graphic is pretty good, the maps look cool and the special effects are well detailed. Everything is in a pretty comic style and there is no violent. You can play it with your whole family (if you turn off the damage...I am already hearing your kids cry...) and your friends.  The only thing I have to fault is the sometimes angular graphics. The sound is nice, too, but it had a bit potential upwards.  TL; DR This game is a Mario Kart for PC with an unfair Single Player Damage and no Online Community. Play with your friends or Offline and have fun! (See my Sonic all Star Racing Transformed Review which has 87/100 points before you buy!!)",

            "review_text": "F1 race starts is a arcade racing game that is similar to mario kart. The racers are real f1 race stars, and the items have been changed to fit the game. Unlike mario kart this is not a very good racing game.  Personally I've played almost all of the mario kart games, so this game was not very hard in the slightest for me. The reason it's so easy is that fact that you have no “rival” racers. In Mario Kart, you usually have a few characters that get 2nd or 3rd place as you get first and keep really close to you in points for the standings. In this game I would be able to finish 5th and 6th at times and still win because some other person with no points would win the race and I'd still be in first.  There are not that many different tracks and you will go over the same tracks over and over again in different cups. There are 30 cups, which vary in the amount of tracks they have. At first they are just slandered races but eventually the other cups apply a variety of challenges instead. Sometimes you have to stay in first to get points, other times you have to collect cups on the road to add to points. Each track also has a shortcut system that I personally never used, but if you are having troubles I'd recommend looking their locations up you can win races just by using them.  The racers are not really exciting, and the attributes each pair of racers have didn't alter my experience. The power ups are balloons, and other real world things that aren't creative, like a torpedo, a ghost boost that makes you invulnerable and move quickly. One of the most awful idea's the game put in is this stupid pit system. If you get hit by a balloon or something, your car is damaged and moves slowly, and you have to go out of your way and lose placing to drive through the pit stop. Really stupid idea in an arcade racer.  One more thing to say about the difficulty there are 2 cups that are an insane spike in difficulty. In these they have the damage set to extremely high so if another racer even touches you you have to go pit and they all pass you. It took me 3 hours to do the first and 3 to do the second. They are quite random and will aggravate you so much you might just quit the game.   I bought this game for about 5$, it has a few dlc's that are for multi-player which doesn't exist. This is not a very good game unless you are a diehard mario kart fan. Even then go play that instead.",
