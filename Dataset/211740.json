Easily one of my favorite stealth games of all time. The levels are large and incredibly organic, with several hidden passages and ways to traverse them. The difficulty is challenging but not tedious. The graphics are dated, but more than makes up for it in incredible sound design and ambient music, wonderfully composed by Eric Brosius. Not only that, but the game is filled with character. The atmosphere is dark and the fantasy world presented here is creative and interesting, but the game also has a very dry sense of humor that keeps things from getting too grimdark. Fantastic voice work from Stephen Russell, who voices the memoriable recurring guard Benny, the very eccentric, Truman Capote-esque villian Karras, and the delightful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a protagonist Garrett.  Absolutely fantastic game. Demands to be played several times, to learn the levels, to perfect them, and bask in the atmosphere and world created here. Do not let it's age turn you away.",

            "review_text": "In  Thief II  we see the return of Garrett as he faces a new threat that has arisen because the equilibrium was disturbed after his previous venture. The new foe will seem unbeatable from our hero perspective, who, as usual, just wants to be on his own and make a living by what he does best, thieving, a thing that won't go far for him because a new faction that rises to power in The City will interrupt his schemes. The situation calls again for the master thief as he gradually involves himself in the unfolding of the master plan behind this new faction and its leader.  Again, like in the previous game,  Thief I , I chose to install a mod for some minor fixes I've read that this game needs, although from my experience, at least, with these two games I have never encountered a single crash or any major inconvenience (excepting here the fact that Garrett is totally lacking basic ladder climbing skills). I chose a simple and light mod, without graphical enchantments called New Dark (Unofficial patch), which, as the name suggests, is a patch, namely a community patch. Regarding the game itself, as a whole, I can say that it is largely similar with its predecessor, with a few improvements, of course. The difference is seen when we look at the story, the first game focusing more on the old ways, nature and the world beyond while this game centers its story inside The City and its altering under the Mechanists.  Altogether this game didn't disappoint, as expected, and it is, for me at least, as good as the first game. Give it a go if you have finished  Thief I .",

I wish I would've found this game sooner, it's one of the most explicitly stealth oriented games I've ever played. It also removed the annoying dungeon-crawling levels from the first game, replacing them with no-violence stealth missions. Unlike most modern stealth games, this one doesn't let you get away with getting spotted by killing whoever has seen you, you'd better have some flash bombs or a good escape route, or else the only way you're leaving is in a bodybag.",

            "review_text": "This is my second review for the second game in this eponymous stealth series, enjoy B's.  Pro's: This game, just like its predecessor before it, really makes you feel like a Thief. When all the cylinders in your brain are firing off at perfect formation you will honestly feel like no one can stop you from 'borrowing' their precious goods. The game is a direct follow up to The Dark Project (Thief Gold) and continues pretty much right after the first game, give or take a month or two. One thing they really improved upon in this game is the level design. I didn't think they could make it any better but it's even more logical now rather than Maze-like. Thief Gold also had logical level design but some of the levels were more like Mazes than a real tangible place that you could believe existed. In this game it feels more grounded than the first and more tangible, you rob a Bank, Frame a City Watch guard, Tail an informant, Crash a party and rob the denizens of the City, and help a friend rescue his unrequited love. All of those things add up to an experience that permeates into something so immutably real that I almost forgot I was playing a damn game.  Another thing that really helps you get immersed is Garrett himself, he now talks and comments on things way more frequently and has more character depth overall. Which in turn makes him even more likeable than he already was. Without spoiling anything there is one part where you break into some ladies home and Garrett just calmly says 'Don't mind me ladies, just passing through' it really makes you feel like he is more than just a cypher for the player. Another real huge improvement is the inclusion of proper secrets in every mission. Most missions can have up to 8 or more secrets for you to find and they can be as simple as a short-cut or something really nice like some loot for you to plunder.   Con's: Once again there is not very many faults with this game but if there is one thing I didn't like as much as the first game it is the villain. He has a voice that sounds like a mixture of Cartman and Meatwad. Hard to feel intimidated by someone like that when I have that image in my head. He isn't a terribly written character and I really dig his motives and behaviour I just think a better voice could have gone a long way to make him seem badass. Maybe another complaint I can say is the final 3 missions are kind of 'Meh' overall and the ending as a whole isn't as awesome as the first game.   Overall Feelings &amp; Score: I feel like this game is not only just a worthy sequel to the first game but it is also a damn fine game in its own right. I give the game a $ out of *...make up your own mind and decide for yourself if you can enter...The Metal Age. Mind your P's and Q's because your balls, are, about to drop sirs and madams, peace the F out!",

Though the shift to a more industrialized setting gives the impression that there'd be more repetition in visual design don't be fooled. Maps are more detailed than in the first game. New items are introduced, filling a variety of roles that provide for more freedom of gameplay. Also female guards! You wouldn't think it but this adds a surprising amount to guard interactions and I really can't think of any negative outcomes of it.  You absolutely owe it to yourself to play this and Thief Gold, if you've played one without the other you're missing out of the the definitive Thief experience.",

Though it doesn't have the same 'horror' element that the first game had, it's still very atmospheric with an incredible ambience that will suck you in to its dark, treacherous world and it won't let go until Karras closes the doors to Soulforge, forever sealing his fate! (yeah, more on Soulforge later).  All of the original Thief gameplay mechanics are still in place w/ added features: the stealth is in full effect with deeply complex missions and large maps that allow for multiple routes to completing objectives, all the sexy arrow types you loved from the first game are back (now with vine arrows), all of your original gadgets are back (now with scouting orbs, and in rare cases explosive devices), there are new enemy types (most notably female soldiers) and of course a new antagonist (alas, Constantine is no more, but Karras is easily just as much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as he was, so it's cool, and there's even a ghost pirate at one point if you can find him and his glorious pirate booty....um....let me rephrase that, I mean his treasure). Oh, and I almost forgot one of the coolest upgrades, the cinematics between missions (some play out like storyboard drawings but others are actual cinematics and there's sorta one when you die too, but obviously that's not as cool as the others).  Now back to the final mission, Sabotage at Soulforge, Karras' stronhold, his HQ, the locus of his nefarious activities, yeah you get the point. Being a final mission you'd expect some level of challenge and complexity and Soulforge certainly doesn't disappoint. But seriously, this mission for me was so vast and complex that I spent nearly a quarter of my total game time wandering its darkened corridors with like negative 5 hitpoints at some points, all while trying to figure out where I should go next and how not to get killed by Karras' mechanoid creations. After finally beating this mission, I almost felt like I couldn't recall an earlier point in the game but Soulforge. It was as though the entire game took place in this one hub-like area. Mentally, I was nearly defeated by this final quest but I persevered in the end and so Karras can suck it!  If you like Thief you'll love this one just as much, if not more so. Get it on sale when you can but as far as classics go, it's a must own even if you have to pay the full price and there is so much depth and challenge that you'll be glad you made the purchase in the end.",

I love this game and another Warren Spector game called Deus Ex. Both are marellous but in different ways.  This game makes sure your always outnumbered and outgunned so combat almost always leads to your doom which makes the game far more intense. Each footfall could alert a guard and shadows become your friend.  I recommend this as one of the best stealth games ever made.  'praise be to karas, blessed are thine welded'",
