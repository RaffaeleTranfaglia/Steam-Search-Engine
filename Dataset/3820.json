            "review_text": "Bloodrayne 2, is an older game to what i'd normally play. But my penchant for vampires in film and games won out. This game was made before vampires became pansies, and the character player, Rayne, shows this by being what you'd expect. She cuts people apart, and seems to try and appear as sexual as possible.  I can't say much for the plot, it's -very- generic, and the environments get old very quickly. The abilites are alot of fun to use, i personally favored those abilites which altered the perception of time. The rank three of such abilites is drastically overpowered, but alot of fun.  Enemies serve as healthpacks, Rayne can latch on and drain their blood to heal herself, and she's got a large amount of dodges and flips in her arsenal. You'll never get anything more than guns and blades, but these can be sufficently amusing.  The main issue with Bloodrayne 2, is the camerawork. It is TERRIBLE, and can/will get you killed due to some sadistic edge the developers had. My using a 360 control fixed this, but not everyone would have that choice.   This game isnt amazing, it's old style generic, and we really lack this kind of game in the current day. It's fun mostly due to nostalgia, and the sensation of playing something different to the standard War FPS.",

            "review_text": "BloodRayne2 is a hack&amp;slash goodness . If you like bloody gore and cuting of limbs of helpless enemies this game has more than several ways to please you. You got to love games where your character feels overpowered .  You will have to fight camera angles a little bit . Its one of those limited budget games but I played so many that it is like second nature . Cutscenes do not show up for some people and my controler does not work properly .  There are different skills you need to utilizy to find certain objectives but in terms of puzzles there is nothing that stands out as hard or thought provoking .  If nothing else this game is held up by Rayne herself with her sexy grabs that are deadly to her enemies and yet may make you a little hot .  The story revolves around getting revange which always seems to be a rewarding experience as you will meet and kill those who taunt you . Cutscenes and cinematics are pretty cool and will keep you hooked .  There are some strange leveling mechanics that I did no like . You will need to to thraw enemies using hook to level up your life which is odd way to get stronger .  Like most games that focus mainly on combat it may get a little boring by the end but this just reminds me the kind of arcade like style where you kill enemies and move to the next area .",

Fan patch for custom resolutions and optimization/enhancements is very broke on windows 10 Button prompts don't properly list buttons. Would prefer proper button display   I don't necessarily need 16:9 resolutions, but the amount of technical issues and awkwardness need an official patch before I could reccomend this.",

It had its quirks but the bad sides were easily counterbalanced by the good ones.  I can't say the same from BloodRayne 2. It gave me cancer. I couldn't find a single positive thing to say, maybe except the graphics were better than the first game.  The combat was terrible: the character is not a badass sexy vampire anymore but some kind of weakling that cannot be ♥♥♥♥♥ to hit hard enough to knock back basic enemies as they have no issue unching through your combos to flatten you on the ground. I really felt like I was playing a 8 years old girls trying to fight John Cena.  Then comes the throwing/aiming mechanic that is just plain luck-based. Nothing more to add. Just have luck on your side when you need to throw an enemy somewhere particular.  It's really sad to see they turned such a good game into a piece of whatever this is. 23/100",

Truly a cult-hit phenominon, BloodRayne is one of those series that needs to continue because it's such a fun experience and as many vampire games as there are, even the ones you play as the vamps themselves, it's never truly as much a fun action experience as this. Fun, stylized, graphic-novel styled, sexy, and gratitously violent; BloodRayne 2 is a game for a fan of anything good. Though I do recommend picking up the original game that takes place in WWII instead of 2005.",
