I wasted 5 minutes of my life just to have it run in the background so I could get trading cards and then sell them for 0.15$... And I don't even know why I'm writing this review. That's another 3 miutes of my life.  If you like Mahjong, just play normal Mahjong. Windows' Mahjong is so much better than this crap.",
