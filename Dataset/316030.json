            "review_text": "I absolutely love the backwards correctly insane insanity of the wonderlands wobbly wonders.  American McGee´s alice and madness returns are quite good if not excellent interpretations of the wonderland in all it´s weird and strange glory.  This Disney version is quite good aswell. The movie had Tim Burton and Jonny Depp which i am a fan of. The game retains alot of that feeling, which is good. But this games strong point is beyond any doubt the local coop.  A wholesome strangely strange excpirience that can be shared. Refreshing and envigorating.  Technically the game is a bit quirky, with low framerates in cutscenes and odd audio sparkling at times. But generally the game worked just fine for me, and i really enjoyed playing it in local coop.",

            "review_text": " Before I start my review I would like to let everyone know that I played Alice: Madness Returns first, and I'm sick of playing another Alice game. That was way too long, way too tedious and has got me hating the idea of playing yet another god dammed Alice game.  Anyways, I got in this game and noticed that it's based exactly off of the 2010 reboot film Alice in Wonderland. Now I only watched bits and pieces of the movie so I don't know how precise the game is to the movie. One thing I did notice is that the game grasped how Alice is still the same annoying, stupid and ditzy character as she is in the movie. If I hear her say 'How Peculiar' one more F**KING TIME I'm going to f**king kill myself!!! Anyways, luckily you play as the characters thoughout the film/game and not Alice, starting with McTwisp the rabbit, Mad Hatter, and EVEN CHESHIRE MOTHER F**KING CAT!!!!!! (Or Cheshurr Cat accoring to the idioitic misinformative game dev's)  The game feels like a cross-breed between Ratchet &amp; Clank (PS2) and Spyro the Dragon (PSX), it's an open, yet still linear base game where there's lots of hidden collectables (abilities you need to find to unlock before purchasing) and currency from destroying the objects throughout the map. The collectibles are in the most stupid areas, by the time I found the first one (not the first one singlehandly given to you) I already had 15K currency, and from paying 800-1000 per ability you're pretty much set to buy every damn unlock you receive which makes it almost too easy.  You need to constantly find cake and potions for Alice to make her big/small to fit though certain doors correspondingly, which makes no sense why a small Alice can't fit through a big door when Mad Hatter (who's 6' tall) and that fat a** Cheshire Cat can fit through a small door.  **SPOILER** After you meet the White Queen she marks every chest and unlockables you missed on your map and makes it so Alice does not need to grow/shrink to access any door, thank god! Therefore there is some sort of replay value going back to previous levels to unlock more things (much like R&amp;C/Spyro).  The controls are Keyboard (NO MOUSE) or Controller only! So if you're like me and only use a Keyboard + Mouse good luck. It takes time to get used to switching characers, using their different abilities and mastering the movements in combat to protect that stupid useless Alice from being captured.  The music and graphics are good, besides the frame rate dropping ball sack during every cutscene! It's so choppy, and it's not my graphics trust me. It's poorly developed. Thankfully this game is not too long, and the boss fights take some thinking to defeat them which is nice.  In the end, I would recommend this game over that garbage Alice: Madness Returns, but I would NOT EVER pay the CDN $22 for this crap, it's only worth maybe $5, so wait 'till it's on sale to ever consider getting it like I did.  5/10",
