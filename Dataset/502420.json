Like: Only has a time limit for getting to the fire, you can take as long as you want of putting the fire out. Great game play. Love it  Dislikes: Somtimes waiting for a call takes long, animations are bad and some but not too many bugs.  I wouldnt call this game a simulator because i know for a fact that firefighters just go to scenes and back to station, they do more then that.",
