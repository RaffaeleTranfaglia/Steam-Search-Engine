    "description": "Energy Balance is a number puzzle. You have to swap power units in such a way that their sums form correct chains both vertically and horizontally. The game is easy to learn, but very hard to master. So, are you ready to peep under the hood of an alien spaceship?",

            "review_text": "  I really liked this game, and i would recommend it to people who like math and/or think.  It's quite addictive and serves its purpose to make you think, despite its following minuses: - repetitive music (had to turn it off after like ~30 mins) - plot kinda makes no sense, although it's not really needed here, but still (our ship doesn't work - lets fix one system, now another, now next one - meow(confused) ) - tiles color should be either changeable or a bit less dark (sometimes background has same color with tiles)  Now one math related issue: +0 and -0 make no sense, could you change it to just 0, or empty tile?  Thanks for your game and keep going.",

            "review_text": "Cheap puzzle game.  Your task is to rearrange the numbers on a grid so that each line adds up to a target sum. You do this by switching numbers around on correct lines so that the crosslines start to add up; sometimes you can switch out numbers with extra spots that aren't used in any sum; and sometimes you need to carefully switch out equal pairs so that you can free up numbers you need elsewhere. The learning curve for this is ultra steep. Each level is randomly generated numbers on a pre-configured grid - if you leave a level, you'll get new random numbers the next time you play it.  Since the audio is a synthetic space background music track, the feedback is purely visual; and that is only in terms of animation, correct squares, lines or results don't change color, they just spawn some fireworks (in addition to some general blinking going on, so don't play this if you're sensitive). It works somewhat because the fireworks along the lines is fairly discernible.  Note that when playing this game, you first have to click through a bunch of dialogue that is you talking to your space cat (press space and a 'skip' icon appears), which you will do as you enter each level, each time, before you get to the numbers grid. Your reward for finishing a level is the ability to access the next level and see more space cat dialogue.  The game is realized with Unity, and it scales up nicely to 1080p fullscreen, or you can play it windowed (albeit non-resizable).  The problems I see with this game are poor visual feedback, and no audio feedback; a steep learning curve because there are no handcrafted levels that would slowly add difficulty, leaving the player to flounder with trial and error; and I don't like the graphical style and background music much.  Recommended if you like doing simple sums for fun.",
