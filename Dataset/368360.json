            "review_text": "60 Seconds! is a combination of an action game and a text-based survival game. You play as Ted, the air raid siren has just sounded and you have 60 seconds to grab supplies and family members and get down to your fallout shelter before the bombs hit. Once in your shelter you begin a fight for survival as you ration food, try to make contact with help and venture out into the radioactive wastes.   +Great art style, really feels like it's in the 1950's +The 60 seconds portion of the game is rather unique +Each run has a different story but it's always interesting +Early on in your run it's a real struggle to survive and the game provides you with a good challenge +As well as food and water you have a number of other resources to manage which can be used in certain situations +Some situations have rather amusing outcomes while others have outcomes which threaten the survival of the family +The appearance of the family members changes as the longer they stay in the bunker and appearances also change when they become ill or similar +Most situations can be approached in different ways, for example if there's a dark, unexplored room you can use a flashlight to see what's in there or use your gun to scare off possible hostiles +If, like me, you aren't so keen on the 60 seconds part you can start from the bunker and you'll be given a random selection of resources and family members making it feel like a rogue-like +The writing, until it gets repetitive, is great +Great humour +Great tutorial  -The controls for the 60 seconds in the house aren't great, they're very insensitive and sometimes the control for picking up an item doesn't work even when you're standing next to it which is very frustrating -After around Day 60 it just becomes a case of clicking through the text to get to the next day without doing anything -Sometimes the game presents you with situations you can't actually do due to you not having the right item which is also quite frustrating -The writing gets repetitive quite quickly, in my first run I got to Day 78 (before my save got corrupted) and I saw some situations four or five times  Verdict: Worth Purchasing (7.5/10)  An interesting idea combined with great text-based survival with a great art style, interesting stories, good humour and good writing.

I like how the game makes you think questions like 'If I answer yes here, will this or either that happen next?'. Not every ingame mode is the same and what makes the most changes are your own choices, awesome isn't it? :D  Some of the pros and cons in my opinion;  +The mix between art styles, first 3D and then cartoonish style +Large variety of choices, endings etc. +Runs on lower-end machines +Good soundtracks and sound effects +Some humor here and there  -Still has a lot potential in terms of content -Even more variety as some of the text lines and/or choices are seen pretty often, maybe even too often  Overall rating: 10/10. Why? Because the game itself is stable, working and very fun to play. Even though more content and some variety changes would be greatly appreciated. Plus I got the game off the anniversary sale, so -50% price, couldn't stop myself from buying this :D",

Pancake will stay for the rest of the day and possible the night.  DAY:11 Pancakes leaves the shelter we say goodbye to him and then we eat breakfast We decided that Ted should go out and scavange we're running low on supplies.

Example: 'Game: Oh, I see you have the gas mask, radio, and flashlight, here have an earthquake. Enjoy choosing which one you want to keep! And by the way, I'm going to give you an event tomorrow that will break whichever one you choose. Bye!' All I can do is sit there and go 'REALLY!?!?!' as I flip of the screen repeatedly.  Don't get me wrong, it is a nice game and I do recomend it, ONLY IF you are willing to put up with frustration and tons of attempts just trying to get a good start.",

A challenging survival game based in the nuclear fallout that could've happened during WWII. You get only 1 minute to gather everything you can, so be sure to note where things are prior to that one minute. If you don't gather enough or save too many people, you will run out of supplies very quickly in the shelter. Keep sicknesses in check or it will kill your people, and many other things provide challenges based on RNG. The overall feel to the game is cartoonish with tongue and cheek comedy, and it has some interesting easter eggs in it. I'd give it a 7/10 , it's fun and worth a playthrough at least once! Different outcome everytime almost gurranteed.",

I think this is a beautiful game, where it shows real life problems, and sprinkles comedy in there! there are two 'major' 'bugs', but they are both avoidable. The first- (at least for me) the game crashes after the intro, skip the intro. The turning is laggy during the beginning stage (especially if you have a lot of crap on the computer, which i do), I just skip the first part entirely, and i heard hooking up a controller works as well. I love the humor in the game, the only complaint is that some situations (bandits threatening to break down my door and the radio saying I need to cut down trees - my axe broke when healing Mary Jane earlier, so i dont know what happens if you cut down the trees, but it would be close to impossible to think up new situations in a game where you can survive for over 113 days (my record is 113, timmy ran away because he was sick, the wife was taken while scavenging, mary jane burst through the door because i didnt talk to her, and the shelter was overrun by a preacher while ted was scavenging) I like how most actions have consequences. i think it was worth all 10$, but if you dont like repeditivity, slightly crude humor, or mutant cockroaches, i recomend a different game. if you are fine with everything i listed, play it!",

For starters why would someone build a Fallout Shelter in their house; then decide not to fill it at all.  2.) Why doesn't Ted's family get their lazy asses up and grab stuff with me when the alarm goes off? 3.) How does a cockroach mutate after only 8 days of radiation, (I thought that Cockroachs were suppost to live through Nukes.) 4.) How come no one decides to ever load the gun if we have ammo and a Rifle? 5.) Why does rodant killer heal wounds in this game? 6.) Why do random cavemen drawings show up on the sides of my shelter? 7.) So Ted decided to put all that furnature down there, (chairs, Shelves, etc.), but no supplies at all? 8.) How does a can of soup last EXACTLY 737 years according to this game? 9.) Why do you need a suit case to carry more than one item on your journey? 10.) Finally, and most importantly, why do the dead bodies of my family keep their hair?!?!  Someone please explain!!

After wards you live out your life, waiting for the military to rescue you....or what fate might bring to you otherwise.  This game is a load of fun to play. The physics are hilarious, the dialouge hits home, but never goes overboard, and the asthetics are while not with great fidelity, perfect for the scenery, especially since it is depicting a depressing period in history.  If you are into these sort of text-based adventure games, then give this one a go! It certainly hits the mark in my books, and there have been many comic and tragic memories from this game that I will forever treasure.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

This concept of the game is poorly developped I mean on this first part I see a gameplay of a free game you get from a flash game on internet. The idea was not well tought out.  Part2 : This is where things get fun, the game gets real interesting on the survival part. Taking decision that might end the lives of your survivors or it might also give you exactly what you need. Even if it demands some luck it demands a lot of risk taking which is exactly what at least I was looking for.   Even if that game is very fun it does not have enough content and I wish the game creators would have tough about it a little more and added game changing details. This is a good game but not worth it's orgin price it is worth half.

However, the scavenge sequence just felt too choppy for me, may have been the poor performing pc I am currently using, but loved the survival only option. I enjoyed the choices that had to be made throughout the survival experience, the first time or so, but I quickly found myself having the same options everytime. The writing was one aspect I really did enjoy. The journal to flip through everyday made each day of surviving pretty humurous, granted that there was a unique experience the day before. The generally short playthoughs made the game somewhat fun, but as I mentioned I ran into the same scenarios quite a few times.  Overall, I would say this is a great game if you need to kill a short period of time, possibly more ideal as a mobile game (speaking of course of the survival mode). If the developers made this into a mobile game, I'd probably pick it up and enjoy it occassionally in situations like waiting at the doctor's office, airport terminal, etc. Lastly, the $10 price is a little steep for the experience I had, but since this is Steam, I would say snag it if you're interested and it's on sale for about $5.",

Especially when you're low on supplies, there will be different types of events such as bandits trying to raid you, dealing with cockroaches, and animals or creatures trying to steal your food.

I love it all as a game, but my biggest draw, and unfortunately this was the thing that made me refund it, was the fact there is so little to do.   The game looks good, it sounds good and it plays well but it becomes boring just clicking the same menus after each day. I appreciate the craft made to show things both being damaged or used such as a torn gas mask, ripped up map or having Timmy wear a colander and holding a squirrel (if I remember correctly). I just don't recommend buying this for 10 dollars.   Maybe if a few minigames or a few other features were thrown in it'd be a lot more fun. But the mad dash at the beginning is the biggest core component of its gameplay. Sure you can play the tutorial, practice getting supplies &amp; eventually running the full game and seeing where you stand. My longest streak was 40 days and when I played for the first hour, it was a lot of fun but I noticed it was very repetitive. Maybe that's part of the point, and if so, sorry I missed it. Sending people out is about the second funnest part of the game aside from the overall decision making process. I just wish there was more control over it. More to do. I'd like to pick the place I could go maybe, maybe pick the actions I make or what supplies. The game is very text intensive, and I apprciate that, so I don't see why we couldn't have some more prompts out in the field or handling situations.  I felt bad refunding this game, because I really like the idea but $10.00 for something like this, compared to say a game like LISA, it kind of really draws points against itself for $10.00. If this game had a little more, just some more decisions, maybe a bigger house, maybe a smaller house, maybe just a few more options to really make it your own experience, with maybe a bit more gameplay elements, and I'd have kept it wholeheartedly. I'd like to maybe rename the Wife and Kids and Ted as it were. It'd make me feel more involved.  I mean I could feel their plight, being stuck somewhere for a long period is no fun. So if I missed the point, again I'm sorry but I feel like this would make a good game to give a kid in his younger ages like maybe 11 to 13 and say 'here have some fun with this' and it'd satisfy their desire to make decisions, but for me, it didn't hold my attention long enough combined with the price point.   I'll be honest, I'll pick it up again when it goes on sale probably because I see hope for it. I just wish I didn't have to feel like I wasn't getting my moneys worth.  The design? Good. The sound? Satisfying. Gameplay? Lacking, my biggest point against it. I hope this game grows and the people who made it continue to add to it, but as it stands I don't recommend it for the combined price point and lack of overall variety",

            "review_text": "A playful jab at Cold War Americana, a choose your own adventure serial that could use more effort overall, and a game, in that order.  The art style effectively parodies the Reagan era suburban family. Most of the graphics are two dimentional sketches in which beauty will be in the eye of the beholder, but I largely found unimpressive and lacking in variety. The three dimentional gameplay segment is function, but equally forgettable art wise. Music also fails to linger after the game is switched off.  The game is effectively two games in one. The first being a time management puzzle evocative of the game's title. The second being a decision driven visual novel. The two elements don't inherently feel connected, save that your performance in the former slightly enhances your experience of the latter. The game itself seems to realize this as either segment can be played independent of the other through some of the default options. For two games, two reviews are in order.  The time management puzzle is a glorified random number generator. Tasked with procuring the best and most necessary supplies for your fallout shelter in 60 seconds, the fact that all supplies are randomly scattered throughout the house on each playthrough, while the house's layout is fixed, means that you'll naturally develop an optimal path for maximum stuff accumulation, hoping that the correct stuff is in the correct place. In short, the segment plays itself for the most part, aside from the infusion of varience in the form of player mistakes. Controls are slippery and require spamming clicks to force the avatar to execute the desired action, no doubt to raise tension but frustrating nevertheless.  The visual novel is full of delightful anachronisms that may induce a hee hawing from time to time, but they do repeat themselves frequently. You'll soon find yourself skipping through the family status updates and consequences of previous decisions to get to the meat and potatoes of your upcoming encounter. Most of the decisions in the game are focused on rewarding you for having the correct tool when prompted (or inversely punishing you for not having or using said tool). Some choices rely on your memory of previous encounters or informtion, which deliver a more satisfying sense of accomplishment when overcome and a sense of fair play on the game's part when you fall prey to them. For the most part though, luck is a large factor, making the exercise less about achieving victory and more about enjoying the story of your family victimized by the ravages of a pulp fiction nuclear holocaust.  Your $10.00s will buy you a few hours of entertainment from this title before it starts collecting virtual dust on your virtual shelf, awaiting the next major content update that may never come. You can do worse for the money, but you also could do better, and with the release of games like Stardew Valley, I find myself expecting more from my indie titles nowadays. If the idea of a pulpy, witty game about nuclear war and American values interests you, the Fallout series has been scratching that itch since the 1990s (Those games from the 1990s are likely obtainable at a comparable price tag to this title and absolutely dominate in comparison regarding content). Consequence driven visual novel lovers can get a more rewarding experience from the Telltale games or a dedicated visual novel game.",

So while I can't recommend this game, neither do I feel the game isn't without merit.  The key thing to understand about 60 Seconds is that it is a game driven by a random number generator. All events, big or small, are a dice roll in regards to good fortune or bad fortune. Sometimes, you'll survive for months...other times you'll be lucky to last a week.   The biggest problem with the game is that, regardless of what you do or what supplies you take with you, there's very little you can do to affect the overall outcome of the game. Yes, Bug Spray can be used to make a replacement Medkit, and the Boy Scout Handbook is overall the best item you can take with you, but their value hinges on you getting the events to use those items...preferably before you get one of the fundamentally unfair disaster events, which forces you to choose between three supplies and you can only save one - nevermind how many people are in your shelter at the time.  60 Seconds is a game that has its charm. The art style is excellent, the humor witty, the writing is engaging (Until it grows stale from repeat views). Even the RNG aspect of the game can be engaging, if one is drawn to chance-based gameplay.  It's just that same RNG can quickly take the charm out of the game. Beyond the Boy Scout Handbook *always* being the best solution to any problem, there's actually very little you can do to influence the course of the game. Indeed, you can have all the pieces needed for rescue available, only to have it snatched from your hands by one of the aforementioned disaster events.   TL;DR Version: The game is flawed, but not without its charm. Wait for a sale, and give it a go. Just don't expect to win.",
