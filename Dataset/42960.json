            "review_text": "I begin with the United Kingdom, quickly releasing all nations that it holds such as that of Australia, Canada, Ireland... Ireland...This shall be my empire, this shall be where I forge my glorious ideals of a world wide state, dominated by guiness and whiskey. I began expanding, I was making a lot of money, so much infact that I had begun taking over the world's market, despite the fact I was only a small nation. I needed raw materials, Ireland as an island, was not quite enough. My military slowly grew, soldier after soldier poured out of the gates of the Dublin Military Academy. I tried begging France to join me on my righteous crusade. I built boats as to carry my army, now I shall leave the greatest cities of Asia but smouldering piles of rock and ash. I landed in Johore, a small country in the Malay area. The many armies, 1st of Cork, 3rd of Derry, all fought hard in the jungle and despite disease and famine pulled through, it was now mine, it was now Ireland's.   I begun developing this hell-hole into a place where an Irishman could hop off the steamboat and expect a pint waiting for him by the beach. Sadly, the Ottoman Empire decided we were getting too big for ourselves, too cocky. They landed in Galloway, forcing up to Dublin through the few troops that were left behind after the conquest of General O'Doherty in Asia. I quickly negotiated peace, they demanded we disarm, we had little option. I began to rebuild the country, look to other places for inspiration. Maybe Africa? What about Western America? As I gazed off into the sea from my cosy office in Dublin I got news of Portugal declaring war? What for? I haven't got the slightest idea. And then again, Britain had now declared war on me! What was I to do? My navy was still half way around the world attempting to frantically sail back to the homeland, disbanding the colony in Johore dismantling that pub that had become so popular with the plantation owners.   The British army quickly crossed from Wales and Belgium, my closest ally at the time, refused to aid me in my most finest hour. I quickly negotiated peace with Britain once again, however Portugal was more stubborn. By calling my peasants to arms I managed to fend off the assault from Lisbon and just as the troops were recovering, awaiting supplies and reinforcements from Asia, the Netherlands declared war. I once again quickly negotiated with Portugal to face my new oponent, the sky was looking dark for Ireland and her dreams of imperialism. The Dutch landed in Derry, I couldn't fend them off, all other nations had put me under mandatory disarmament - I couldn't call any more units to arms, it was a disaster! The Netherlands thankfully backed off, supposedly seeing some dim light in my attempts of peace. Now under four consecutive disarmament orders and being passed pillar-to-post by nations like a puppet state, Ireland sits thoughtfully on the side of Britain - its empire decimated, its people sat in sadness and its cities burning from the cannons of Europe. Not much to do now but bide our time in hopes of another oppurtunity...one day...  Such is the life of a potato farmer with big dreams.",

And most countries have flavour events + Westernization is great  --- Learning curve kills players -- Trading system I still dont get after about 100 hours  Also note: You need to have played at least 2 or more Grand Strategy titles before playing this (total war does not count.)",

            "review_text": "Alright, after nearly FIVE HUNDRED hours of fun, and countless more hours likely to come, I think it is far past time that I write my reccomendation for this game.   DISCLAIMER : DO NOT BUY THIS GAME WITHOUT THE TWO MAIN EXPANSION PACKS  First and foremost, let me be VERY clear. Victoria 2 is a very deep game, and regardless of your previous strategy experience, you will understand nothing diving headfirst into this game. You may THINK you understand what you are looking at, but you really don't. Like Dark Souls, your very first games, you will fail again and again and again. However, you will eventually, after a few hours, get the hang of things. And it is definetely worth the effort!  Victoria 2 is by far my all time favourite game. Period. It is a grand strategy game set in the dawn of the Victorian era. France has been defeated just twenty years prior, the Ottoman Empire is dying, German nationalism is on the rise, and the British Empire is the greatest power in the world. In this game, you can click on any of the 150+ countries on the map and hop right in. Unfortunately, there are some nations which are simply not meant to be played, namely the Indian and German minor states.  When you jump in, you will first notice an absolute flood of information, and all the tabs lead to spreadsheets (which are very intuitively designed). You will doubtlessly be overwhelmed, but that's okay. Everyone is. The reason for all this info is because you have control over every aspect of your nation. From Politics, to diplomacy, to military, to economy, it is all there. This probably seems scary to a new player, but this is what keeps me coming back to this game rather than EU4. There is a lot to do other than paint the map.  Not being able to paint the map or not being able to do a world conquest is the beauty of this game though. It really forces your hand into diplomacy with other nations. Not only that, however, but this game goes much deeper than Europa universalis, for example. Every person is simulated (with populations rounded down to 1/4th of actual figures) and the game has a functioning global economy, with prices rising and falling, and economies of scale which can be affected by wars, rebellions, industry, you name it! You can also expand the influence of your nation, bringing smaller nations into your sphere, and using them as puppets to fight your wars, or to exploit their resources for your benefit. The possibilities in this game are truly endless.  Unlike Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis, this game does not like to let you blob out. With the memory of Napoleon fresh in the minds of everybody, if you do too much aggressive action, you get these points called 'infamy' which slowly decays bi-monthly. If your infamy goes above a certain level (25.00) then every nation tends to attack you. To fend off these coalitions, you have to be immensely powerful, and this seems to be where new players are driven away. You cannot rely on blobbing out in this game, unless you can count on beating the combined forces of Europe alone. My word of advice: ALWAYS stay below the infamy.  The negatives in this game are few and far between. There used to be still a handful of bugs, however these were patched just a few months ago. The only real issue I have is lack of steam multiplayer, which forces you to rely on programs such as 'Hamachi' just to play in a multiplayer session with friends. Another tiny negative is that the soundtrack does not have anything in store for the intense great wars of the late game, but this is very easily overlooked.  A short list of pros and cons:   Pros  -Amazing gameplay, endless replayability which can keep you entertained for hundreds to thousands of hours! -Extremely deep 'simulation' (I hate using that word) of every nation -Very well optimized. Runs perfectly on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, and even better on my main rig -Massive great wars. What's not to like? -Beautifully composed soundtrack -Detailed global markets and industry -Play as any nation in 1836 or 1861   Cons  -No steam multiplayer  If you are into strategy, and are willing to put 3-10 hours of 'trial and error' time into this game, then definetely pick it up (with all the expansions!). After learning the ropes, you will likely fall in love with this game as I have.",

Here is my expierence:   - I decided to play a game as Finland. I started out with a relatively high literacy rate, at about 65%, however they were a puppet under Russia - Even though my pop was low, at about 300k, I trained as many troops as I could, I only had about 10 I could train altogether.  - I started to increase my relations with Prussia, in hopes that they would support me in an independence war. - I began to research military tech out of my ♥♥♥ to get ahead of Russia, which usually has a very hard time researching tech. - The year 1852 rolls around, it's about mid August. I decided it was time to declare independence. Unfortunatley for me Prussia didn't want to support me when I declared independence.  - Frustrated, I moved my only army of about 30,000 into St. Petersburg. For about 3 months I was met with no resistance. - Late November 1852, the Russians attack my soldiers in St. Petersburg with more than 100,000 troops. As the epic Battle of St. Petersburg rages on, the Russian start sending troops into my territory. I decide to mobilize all I could, which was about 60,000 troops. I manage to fight off most of the invading Russians. - I begin to feel good about myself, that is until I lost the battle in St. Petersburg. I lost about half of my troops while inflicting about 40,000 casualties on the Russians.  - About 4 years later and some couple hundred thousand casualties later, Sweden rises as a great power, and decides to join my war. The war continues on for about another year and half, resulting in my independence and the conquest of St. Petersbug.  - Because of this victory, I was able to quickly conquer southern China, East Africa, and a fair amount of Indo China.  - Then, in 1920, my empire collapsed due to Sweden declaring war on me and dismantling me.",

            "review_text": "For the price, this is an excellent game. My dissapointment was that the one great power who's capital is outside Europe, the United States, is not given much chance to influence factors outside of it's own continent. Expansion into the western portion of North America is heavily simplified and doesn't give you the feeling of manifest destiny that I was hoping for. Europe appears to be fine though, so if you're planning on uniting Germany under Prussia, it's probably A-OK and you won't have much trouble (An AI did it in my game).   Although it adds tension, making every great power want to expand their influence at every opportunity can lead to scenarios where the tiniest infraction on someone (in my case, developing a reason to declare war on Hawaii as the U.S.) leads to situations such as a Great Britian who decided to ally mexico, declaring war on me. During that conflict, I had to fight a war on two fronts and Jacobin rebels spawned with about four times the army the Confederates fielded during the civil war. There was no hope to win after that.  Overall, I wish it focused more on history and less on these strange scenarios that pop up every so often. On the other hand, if you're a fan of alternate history, you'll probably love this game. If the game is on sale, I recommend buying it with the DLC. Thanks for reading my review and have a good time.",

            "review_text": "Vic2 was my second exposure to historical strategy sim games. EUIII was my first try and it does not trip my trigger. I usually play in north america. CSA succeeds in splitting off. When I first got the game, Great Britain would eventually take territory from USA, but updates seem to have changed that behavior. The aspects of Vicky that I like are:  1. rebel uprisings. They can make you hustle. But you can beat them by watching the level of unrest and if necessary mobilizing troops. 2. national focus. What you choose will affect how the game plays out. Choose to promote immigration and populaton will grow. Choose a political focus, and you may have fewer rebellions. 3. north america- this is my home and the states are familiar to me, as is the history. So I like playing in north america. 4. anti-imperialism - the game is set up for imperialists, since the era was imperialistic. But you don't have to play it that way. The ai is imperialistic, so every one of your neighbors will try to eat your lunch, but you can play them off against each other via alliances. And of course you need good border defenses. 5. modding- Big mods are hard but mini-mods are easy. Just (using the mod folder) change the lua file. For example, I don't like all the time spent on research, so I changed all research (for all countries) to one day in the lua file. I also cranked up the militancy for captured territories (ha!) And I changed the end date of the game. 6. policy choices-if you don't pick the reforms with eye on public opinion, you will get into trouble. 7. budget- this can be tricky but if you are sensible you can avoid bankruptcy. 8. economy- this is more for watching than messing with. Lots of computing seems to go into the choices made by shadowy capitalists. But also you need to cancel subsidies now and then or your budget will suffer.  I recommend the game.",

With the crisis system added with the DLC it really makes you think about who you want to get caught up in an alliance with because when one of your great powers allies or you get caught up in a conflict every great power is dragged into it no one is safe. * You can chose not to take part in the conflict but you will end up taking a massive hit * all in all I'd give it a 10/10  Pro's - very fun - Great way to change how history plays out - You get cant get enough  Con's -♥♥♥♥♥♥ rebellion  - Little but of a learning curve * not to bad *",

By the 1880's, after multiple successful wars with Russia, Korea, China, and several other countries, Japan nearly tripled in size and had become the 5th greatest nation in the world, right behind Russia. At first I was overcome by the sheer joy of success, as Japan was ranked third in industrial power and was one of the most prestigious nations in the world. Then as my economy began to slow down, my income was turning negative for the first time in over a decade as factories closed and unemployment jumped. I began to raise taxes, cut my military and navy, and then I began to raise doubts about my countries future. Unfortunately, my doubts were realized.   As the century turned and the 1900's began, my economy neared depression-level and the national debt was adding up, growing political divisions were threatening the countries stability, and new factions were rising up demanding things like workers rights and calling for a liberal government. The tension came to a boiling point in Pyongyang, where nearly twenty thousand Korean rebels rose up in arms against Japanese rule and were completely annihilated before they could even take two steps forward. At what seemed like the worst time, I was plunged into a war between Germany and Russia, as Germany was the #1 world super power and was my closest ally. Actually, Germany was one of very few countries willing to ally with me as my infamy was a little too high from the Japanese conquests in Korea, China, and Russia. More great powers suddenly joined the war, and it became known as the Great War. My forces were diminished from the get-go, and my allies were too busy fighting their own battles. Before long I was utterly decimated by an invasion force of Russian and French forces and rage quit.   I still haven't turned the tide, but nonetheless I rate this game 10/10.",

Migrating soldier pops mean you have to constantly micromanage armies and replace troops when they suddenly decide to move to another state (which somehow means they can no longer replinish?). There's no army template, like in EU IV, even though it could easily be managed. Naval combat is a drag, and navies take forever to build up despite little to no actual benefit of having them. The UI is tedious, the map modes lacking. I got good at the game before I could even understand how everything worked, easily westernizing as Nejd, taking over all of the Middle East, westernizing, and pretty easily getting into 6th place before my armies got too big to micromanage and Russia tore me to pieces, despite having a far inferior army. The world market is broke to ♥♥♥♥. Liquor demand is through the roof, yet there's always some being thrown out while my guards wait forever to get some, making the recruitment of them impossible (there is a similar problem with demand not being high enough for advanced goods later on, like barrels for tanks). Overall, this is a good game, but it desperately needs to fix the micromanagement.",

Took me probably 30 hours to figure out how the combat system works, very detailed but without an easy to use interface or even a help file that explains the differences in rows and support %'s there's no way to know what's going on. Only reason I understand it is that wikia cleared it up. Great concept of a game, I think the game mechanics are probably great if I could ever figure them out. If this had a better interface or someway to explain things, I'd recommend it and possibly even give it a high score. Since it doesn't, it's worthless to me. 2/10 for potential. Better luck with victoria 3.",
