The plot isn't anything to write home about, but is still decent enough to move you along from begining to end. This game isn't without its flaws though. You'll spend most of the game with no HUD, no minimap and no health indicator. The game is pretty linear and leaves little to no room for exploration. And there are way too many QTE sections. Personally these inconviences didnt bother me. Having no HUD only meant that I could enjoy the beatiful and atmospheric settings of Lost Planet 3.  I recommend you pick up and try this game if it's on sale for $10 or less.",

NOTE: At the time of writing this review I notice that overall review is MIXED it should be POSITIVE (I cant change it of course) but here are some ideas why:  1) Part of community expect another game like previous ones in sequel wich is definitly not 2) Another part expect another game like DEAD SPACE wich is not 3) The rest was annoyed by early bugs (I played this game 2 years after release so either I am lucky one or everything is patched now)",

            "review_text": "When bought on sale for $13 I considered this a good deal in the end. Very immersive. The first two games I barely have a few hours game-time total and could not stand the constant timer you were on. This game fixed that, changed T-ENG into currency instead of a timer for how long you have to live. Story is fantastic, the writing is really good. This would have been an alright B-grade sci-fi film. Voice acting is great too. The gameplay keeps you engaged and by the time it starts to get grindy you are fairly close to done. Playing through the first time on hard took me about 18 hours total. There are a few downsides to this game but everything else is great so I'm just going to list the few negatives:  -Hunting down T-ENG post locations, albino Tarkaa, and Mementos counts for 80% of the grind in this game (use online guides or go crazy) and while optional doing all these things improves your character in lots of ways -One-off experience, after beating the game once I enjoyed almost all of my time with it but it's just one of those things only good once -Console port issues: A few mis-labled button hints and I had one crash in the very middle of the very last boss fight -Steam login issues: If you lose connection to Steam (problem either your end or Steam's end both) it will boot you out of the game into main menu, even on singleplayer, workaround is play in offline mode on Steam but you will not get achievements  Multiplayer looks neat but I'm pretty sure not many people are playing. I beat the game, got Extreme Conditions achievement and am happy with the experience as a whole. A few small problems bring this down to a 7.5/10 overall rating for me, if they fixed the console port issues, crashes, and disconnects from Steam servers booting you even when my internet is fine then this would at least be an 8/10. Story and characters get 10/10. Regular price of $25 for game alone is too much, when it drops around $15 or about $1 an hour when playing through on hard then this is a good deal.",

            "review_text": "This is the only Lost Planet I've played, but LP3 is apparently a prequel to LP2.  In Lost Planet 3, you're on a distant planet working as a contractor mining energy due to an energy crisis on Earth. Your primary obstacles are arthropods that inhabit the planet. You are able to purchase and upgrade firearms and you travel around in a large, upgradeable robot suit that you will use to do battle with. The game consists of a typical primary and side-quest system that allows you to stray and then progress the story at your own pace.  I felt that the story was fairly good and I say that because I actually wanted to play through it to find out what happened next. The gameplay isn't particularly difficult, I played through on 'normal' difficulty, but there are maybe a couple moments where you might get frustrated; there may be some tricks to defeating certain bosses.  I thought that the graphics and audio were good considering that it's a last-gen console game. I ran it at 2560×1440 @ 144Hz and it sat at 144FPS the entire time with the exception of some small hitches in one area. I had no bad technical issues with the game but there were a couple issues: 1) the 'turn the claw' button is displayed wrong and 2) it seems that if Steam goes offline that the game boots you to the title screen; fortunately it auto saves often.  I enjoyed it and I might even re-play just a bit but it's not a game I'll probably entirely replace since most things are achievable in the first playthough.  SLIGHT SPOILERS: 1) You're run out of ammo on one boss and will have to use the handgun to pick away at it. 2) One of the later bosses seems to be immune to grenade damage.",

            "review_text": "Lost planet 3 is a game that I've had fun with walking around in the ultility rig stomping over things without really using the quick travel function. I guess big mech don't really need actual weapons to be awesome! Below are the pros and cons of the game that I've summed up.  Pros: 1. You get to walk around and crush things on foot or pick them up on your ultility rig. 2. Fighting with giant crab doesn't make you feel like a small fry. 3. You learn that throwing grenades into a big akrid's mouth causes the explosions to muffle instead of blowing them up. 4. Hidden weapons from old inaccessable areas from previous visits. 5. Ammo are everywhere during combat, so no worries about bullet/grenade shortage.  Cons:  1. Melee is essentially useless. 2. Instructions is not made for keyboard users. Turning valve on ultility rig for keyboard by default is F. 3. Side quest is not attractive and essentially ignorable. 4. Did not fight last boss on ultility rig :( 5. Last quick time event is highly reliant on a sensitive keyboard.  Conclusion: Overall, Lost Planet 3 is a so-so game because there's too little bossfights in my opinion. I suggest getting it during a sale as the full price isn't really worth it.",

            "review_text": "When it comes to reviews, I favour those that get to the relevant points as quickly and briefly as is reasonable, I will therefore attempt to do so myself.  Visually, I think the game's exteriors are wonderful, it really does convey an extremely cold, foreboding landscape. The interiors are also very good but not quite as convincing.  I find driving around in the rig/mech cumbersome and therefore tiresome, with the relatively late introduction of a quick travel mechanism not helping to ameliorate this.  The controls felt a little unpolished, two examples: an on-screen prompt to use the 'WASD' keys to turn a valve with the mech's claw was inaccurate, you needed to press 'F'; when using the mech's grappling hook to access ledges occasionally you had to be very carefully positioned, other times the positioning was less critical.  The overall plot line was good, not too complicated but gave the game meaning, though there were a few minor oddities which I will not go in to for fear or spoiling it.  Perhaps it is just me but I find the classic boss battle rather tiresome in an “oh look, this area looks just like the sort of place we could have a boss battle, oh what a surprise it is a boss battle, I guess I'll have to spend the next half an hour working out exactly how to defeat it,” kind of way, and this pretty much that tiresome old formula which added little to the game.  Overall, I liked it, but the slow game movement mechanic and control issues detracted from this, making some parts of the game a chore rather than a pleasure.",

            "review_text": "Well what can I say,  The enjoyment I got out of Lost Planet 3 came out of nowhere. I played the first two when they were released and the experiences I had with them led me to not bother with the 3rd for the longest time, boy was I wrong. One of things I look for in a game is a great story wrapped in a solid campaign mode, also being huge science fiction dork, this game had everything I needed. It's an absolutely solid story through and through, plenty of twists and plenty of exposition throughout. So many things that bug me about most science fiction stories where outright done away with within the first hour or so, Jim Payton is perhaps the most grounded and realistic protagonist i've ever seen in a game. He asked every question I would have asked and done everything I would have done in the same (albeit totally ludicrous) situation. The voice acting and dialogue where outstanding, full of really great writing and genuinely likeable characters. The story never dragged, it never slogged and there was just enough to keep it going at a great pace, highly enjoyable right up to the credits.  The gameplay is doled out through perfectly serviceable a solid 3rd person cover based shooting and giant mech sections. Running around on foot can be a little slow outdoors, but you'll be busy soon enough fighting off hordes of giant bugs and loving every minute of it. The combat on foot feels tight, all the weapons maybe your standard game fare but they all pack a hell of a punch, they handle great and upgrades keep things nice and dynamic. The mech sections are fun for whole other reasons, it just feels so cool to wander round the frozen tundra smashing and drilling your way to success. The game is almost half exterminator half space drilling simulator and I loved all of it. The world itself is a mash up between Hoth (some of those corridors look awfully familiar) and the Ishimura from dead space, each sections bring their own challenges to combat and traversal, exploring was a blast.  Lastly the graphics, boy is this a pretty looking game. Maybe not the most technically advanced but the animation was top notch, lip syncing and cut scene work superb and the whole thing just had a real science fiction feel to it. Seeing that stark orange color against the cold blue background just made me happy. Framerate was flawless, never dropped and never stuttered, audio mix was great. Really have nothing to bad to say about it. Game time clocked in at about 11 hours with a few side quests still left to do. Unfortunately I haven't gotten round to the multiplayer yet, I remember the other two being a blast so I'll be interested to see what happens with it.  So at current, for a few quid you can have one of the most grounded and entertaining science fiction stories in years, and I highly recommend anyone who likes a good space age drama to give it a go!

I have mixed feeling about this game. The first half of the campaign is great, I really feel like I'm a rookie employee in an exteme condition planet stumbling upon a dark secret. But the second half is mediocre at best. The plot and storytelling is mediocre. Graphic quality is comparable to other 2013 A-list games while the game play is standard third-person shooter.  Overall it's still enjoyable experience. Only one thing annoyed me, there is no manual saves, only checkpoints. The checkpoints are far between and there is no option to skip in-game cutscenes. So everytime I died, I have to watch the same cutscene over and over again.  By the way, this game has great music soundtrack that really fit the game atmosphere. Setting the giant mecha on top of a mountain and just watching the sky while listening to the music is a breeze. Video-output the game to the projector and audio-output the music to the hi-fi sound system... and I'm lost in the planet ;)  CONCLUSION : Recommended on sale price.",

Everything very realistic and impressive BUT... the Akrids (the monsters) look like exactly the same as with LP1 and, that's awfull. The introductory sequences are like to be watching a good sci-fi film and, it set your expectatives higher than the game delivers at the end. Excesive Keys, that could be resumed in way less keys (multi-functional, depending on context), make the actions more complex than needed. Reaction time between you press a key and the character does the action is a tad high and, this delay is a mess when fighting against some of the Akrids and, very specially when you are surrounded of lots of them. I cannot understand why a game that has been HIGHLY enhanced respect of scenarios and detailed graphics, leaved the combat system and character's movements quite well the same as in LP1. I mean, why the character has no possibility to jump over obstactles, why cannot crouch, why cannot reach other high spots but only those that the engine highlights?. Why the Akrids seem so out-of-dated compared with the rest of E.D.E.N. III world?. DON'T TAKE ME WRONG. IT'S A GREAT GAME BUT, IT COULD BE BETTER and, it's a pitty they didn't took this oportunity to do it. This game, with the free-movement of the character that we can enjoy in games as Splinter Cell, Prince of Persia and alike would be the bomb. Respect of LP1, you can evolve (a tad) your equipment and, for this, you need to do missions rewarded with some 'credits' that you could use to improve your weapons and Mecha. This pinch of RPG is very well wellcome. You are always accessing the 'mission maps' with your Mecha, which is a very slow transporting way. Even that the unarmed Mecha is interesting during the few initial missions, I am really missing the fire power of those Mechas in LP1. Still playing so, I don't know by now if that will change. Anyway, difficulty is being increassed step by step and, new tasks to do are added in each mission and, new Akrids types are summing up after each one. NOT SO FRENETIC AS LP1, most of times but lot of fun, anyway.",

            "review_text": "Just finished Lost Planet 3. Finally. I figure I ought to do a mini-review for this.  Gameplay: 3.5 Graphics: 9. Musical Score: 6. Animations: 4 Storyline: 9.5  The game in itself is what you'd expect from the LP franchise. At least, it goes back to the foundations set down by LP 1, thankfully the whole affair didn't follow the lead of LP 2, and have the whole dang 'Single Player' campaign be focused upon the Co-Op aspects, and 'Objectives' for points. It's all focused on the story, not making your character look shiny, thankfully.  The first thing you'd notice about this is the graphics. Even on the lowest settings, the landscape is breathtaking, the cutscenes are incredibly lifelike, and the effects around you are very exceptional. The small downside that took the graphics down from a 10 to a 9, is that for the most part, the maps are nothing but snow snow snow, and looking at the inside of your Rig. Alright. Might not be a graphical qualm as such, but the impact of having flawless graphics like that, and then generally restricting you to looking at machinery and snow...Well. It's not the full potential, but it's still pretty damn fine.  Coming on from Graphics, Animations. I'm quite the mixed bag when it comes to these, to be fair. The animations from the actual gameplay side of this is fairly smooth. In the intense Rig-Combat parts, things get a little shaky. Animations will occasionally merge together, like you'll be swinging your arm at something, and it'll try and hit you back. It generates awkward situations where you hit them, they go backwards, and their arm'll go flying off backwards, but it'll then still hit you. There's times where the enemy will just lock up if certain animations try to occur at once, giving you a fairly simply time of firing them down. Had this on the last boss, and the animations bug there provided me with a fairly easy win, which was quite the let down. Alongside it, is the animations in the cutscenes. While some of the gestures the characters make in them seems perfectly fine and everything, there's quite a lot of gestures they do which seem to make no sense, and are incredibly robotic looking. They're nowhere near what I'd define as 'Fluid', but more 'Wooden'. The Cinematics are a different story of course, but that's more in the region of CGI Graphics, than model animations.  Gameplay. Now...The gameplay has been rated so poorly, because 7/10ths of the game is tramping around the map, either in your rig or running around the 'Hidden' offshoot areas of the maps. To begin with, this is perfectly fine. You're wandering around. You're stomping the indigenous wildlife (The Akrid). You're drilling down stalactites of ice to carry on your path. It's all good. But after a fair few hours of doing nothing but tramping from one place to the next, it gets incredibly tedious. There's points where you're told to go from your base, all the way to another area, only to have them send you tramping back the way you came, to go somewhere else. And as you dot his, you've gotta hop out your Rig, walk over to the place you're supposed to go, or the person you're meant to talk to, and then you've gotta turn around after a small cutscene and walk alllll the way back again. That gets old. Fast. The on foot combat is the usual sort of thing you get from the LP series as well. Run about slowly, aim at the red 'Weak' spots on the Akrid, rinse and repeat until all enemies are dead.  Fighting in your Rig is a different ballgame though. And not the good kind, really. To say you're in a giant robotic suit, kitted out with a crushing claw arm, and drill hand to start off with...You'd expect the combat to be good. Or at least the fast paced sort of thing you're used to in the LP series, with Vital Suits zipping about all over the place and whatnot. Nope. You tramp about, until some big Akrid shows up. Then it essentially comes down to a series of Quick Time Events (QTEs). Get close. Hit Q when prompted. Click your mouse to grab the Akrid. Click the right mouse button to drill away at it. Rinse and repeat until they're dead. It's as dull as it sounds. The open world aspect of the game is a nice touch, when it comes to the diversity of the environments. But for the most part, the secondary objectives you receive feel utterly pointless, and really not worth their time suffering through the monotonous tramping, just for a few more points of T-Energy. This becomes quite excruciatingly clear towards the end of the game, where you get quite a large amount of side objectives to do...But all are completely unrewarding. They give you a few token things to do, like hunt rare albino akrid, to get 'Buffs' to your character, like quicker reloading, HP regen, or an in-cover aiming reticule. But since you get them essentially two main storyline points before you get to the final stage, you're at that point where you just honestly can't be bothered spending an hour or even two, just tramping around to finish the objectives. Even the completionists out there might struggle to find the willpower to complete this to it's 100% state. What with the fast travelling system you get as well, you can just jump past those objectives without ever really feeling the pain of missing them.  Now. Storyline in itself. Thankfully, this is where LP3 really shines. You can look past the extremely dull and monotonous gameplay. The wooden movements of the cutscenes. And the fact that despite it all, you essentially know how it turns out for Jim, the protagonist, right from the word go. What you don't know, is how he gets there. For fans of the LP1 storyline, you'll love the storyline in LP3. It provides all the lore you'd ever need about the origins of the Snow Pirates, and what NEVEC are after. It gives you a deeper understanding of the planet as well. All in all, it fills in quite a lot of those questions you might have had after playing LP1. But that's not what the story focuses on. It focuses on Jim. A contractor from Earth, looking to make some cash to keep his family running back home on Earth. He's a family man, and that's brilliantly brought to life through the messages his wife sends him from time to time, and the messages he sends back. The little banter, the humour thrown into it all. It generates a very real and deep character from Jim. (And the messages certainly do help relieve the monotony of tramping around the wastes.) The messages are heartwarming, and full of the sort of things you'd expect a message to contain to someone working a long way from home. But even the characters around you all have deep characteristics. They all seem quite real as well, rather than just broken archetypes thrown in for filler. And the story itself? There doesn't seem to be much of one when you begin the game. Heck, for the first half of the game, there's not a whole lot of 'Story' going on. There's no goal. There's just Jim, working away to keep his wife and kid fed. The game does throw you a couple mysteries along the way, and it's evident there's something in the background. But everything still focuses on Jim carrying on with his life.  But then the story abruptly starts, and from there, it's got you hooked in. You want to push through the dull gameplay, just to find out what happens next. Again and again, it just keeps you going, like a book you daren't put down. 'Just one more chapter. Just one more chapter.' That's how it goes, more or less. All I can say about it is, if you loved the Storyline from LP1, then the Story from LP3 will make it worth the hefty price tag.   Overall, the game in itself, isn't worth the price of it. You'd have to invest a lot of time and energy into going through with all the terrible gameplay, to draw out the rewards of the story. I would recommend it, but only for those that are aware that the gameplay in itself is tedium encarnate.  Overall score: 4.5",

What I have been treated to is a very well written story, with lovable characters, both for being funny and annoying, an interesting control system (based on gears of wars' TPS but without so much of the 'stay in cover or you're dog food') with fun weapons and a mech. The other thing that I am loving about this game is the combat, you can fight most foes (Akrid - indigenous creatures ranging from small flower looking 'ants' to huge G-class (gigantic/giant) base stompers) either on foot or in the mech (which is actually just a Utility rig for repairs), at first, even the smallest of these are annoying enough to get you screaming at the TV, and the first encounter with anything above L-class (large) is a 'boss', usually you are forced to do these on foot first then again in the Mech later but after that each boss becomes a generic that can be found and fought just to earn cash (Thermal Energy). As a side note, I will say, if you have nigh on perfect timing, these bigger Akrid become stale and repetitive as all you have to do is respond to an attack, exploit a stumble and attack a weak spot, but one mistake can see your rig shattered (not beyond repair) and you running through a snowstorm with the wrong weapon loadout and a rather angry crab chasing you. As for the story, it's not often I can say i've not found a flaw in the plot, but 14 hours in, I haven't so far. You play as Paton (Looks like Nicholas Cage, sounds like Jayne from Firefly, and is an all round decent guy), a freelance contractor hired to do a two year session on a new planet, repairing the station and collecting T-Energy to be tested as a new, viably source of fuel for earth. After a month or two things start getting a little weird and you uncover a secret that the company (NEVEC) will not want anyone to know. The reason I enjoy it so much is Paton actually makes some human decisions and tries to do the right thing for everyone despite the obvious risk to himself.  ~Round up~  Story - 8 or 9 - I want it to be a 9 but can't give it a solid till i see the 'twist' for the ending. Gameplay - 7 - its a tried and tested system, nothing new but the annoying over use of cover removed so thats a +. Soundtrack - 8 - The Mech has and MP3 player with songs you can flick through as you please, all western frontier style and very fitting for what you're doing, the gun sounds could do with a little improvement but the out of mech 'atmosphere' music is spot on. Graphics - 8 - solid graphics from the 360 era, nothing to write home about but at least some of the characters actually show some emotion on their faces, not Bradock though, he's as readable as a porcelain doll.  Overall - 8 - This could go to a 9 if the story turns out well writen to the end but an 8 is still nothing to moan about. Overall a very good game and interesting to play with enough tme consuming side quests to while away the hours.  ~WMFA~ SOLDIER 1st Class  EDIT: Giving this one a 9 overall, the story was excellent, a good cliffhanger to end on that lends itself to a direct sequal and the possibility of a 'Here's how' story down the line.

However; it goes without saying this game has some major issues, when you play Gears of Lost Planet 3; you'll notice that things like button prompts are faulty; even for the default button settings.

All in all; the game does some things well; atmosphere, story, the way it fleshes out characters. All very well done.

Feel guilty that it was largely overlooked when it came out and that developers Spark didn't survive as a team, I only got it when it was like $8 on Steam. If you prefer the wackier Japenese style of the first two games you may not like this one, as it's more of a traditional Western third person cover shooter. To me that's a good thing, as are the nice visuals, mix of on foot and mech gameplay, and superb voice acting/facial animation. Despite a rather cliched and predictable rundown future story with mega corps, LP3 manages to have an excellent sense of place with a somewhat open world environment that you come to like, and cool references to Aliens, Blade Runner, and of course Dead Space 3 - which it very much resembles. Places include your cozy home base as well as several other locations. Characters are quite interesting and compelling, especially main protag James Peyton, who is very relatable.   There's a few cool upgrades, several very nice weapons, and a mix of fighting and grappling. On normal this is a very easy game, including the boss encounters. I'm fine with that, but if you want a challenge maybe look elsewhere.   An example of an overlooked title where it's obvious people put a lot of work into it for naught. Can only blame myself as I also didn't buy it new. To sum up, this does the Lost Planet series more justice than the first two games, but that's my take on it, i know many disagree.",

The Dead Space games actually feature some genuinely creepy and horrific moments, and the atmosphere is top-notch. In comparison, everything here just falls flat.  75% of Lost Planet 3 consists of walking around in a very slow, defenseless Mech / Rig. When you get to where you need to be, you spend 15 minutes turning a valve, and then when that's finished, walk a few more steps and spend another 15 minutes turning another valve. Every single button \\ computer you interact with breaks down, leading you to find 'another route' / far away button \\ computer. It's just dull, uninspired, tedious game design.   You also have to backtrack for a lot of objectives, and enemies spawn in exactly the same locations; there is no variation, in both the environments or the enemies. When enemies spawn, you can also see them literally appear in front of you most of the time.  The checkpoint system is inconsistent; especially before some of the bosses and harder encounters. After dying, you have to sit through 5-minute unskippable cutscenes again and again. Very annoying on harder difficulties.  I made it about 5 hours in and encountered a game-breaking bug that prevented me from continuing. I'd encountered the bug several times in the game, but they were overcome (eventually). When using the Mech, you have to turn a valve (again) and the controls simply stop working. I tried it on both M+KB and a 360 controller and it just wouldn't let me pass. This is a fairly common bug apparently.  At this point, I'd seen enough of the game and wasn't enjoying it much, so it was the last straw.  The PC controls often don't work, and when the button prompts appear on-screen, they're very often wrong, even using the default control scheme. The game clearly wasn't bug-tested or had much, if any, quality-assurance. Even playing on a 360 controller has some issues with wrong button-prompts and slow interactions.  When very similiar and much better games like Dead Space exist, I find it impossible to recommend this game.",

Most updates are in the fashion of '10% extra damage/armor/ammo for X'.  What kills it is how these elements have to come together in the campaign. The missions are uninteresting: go to this point on the map using your slow rig and turn a valve/press a button. But unsurprisingly, just before you can do this, there's some aliens in the way. Sometimes there's even a boss. Which is just a big alien with a big invisible healthbar with attacks you have to dodge every now and then.

            "review_text": "I bought this game on a Humble Bundle sale, even though it was £1 at the time of my purchase I'd say it was worth the cost. I feel like this game could definitely be a solid piece, if I was lying.  The beginning of the game starts off promising, the boss fights were good, the introduction was timed well and the navigation was okay, the introduction of your Mech is great. That said, late game is has a lot of flaws.  Hitboxes, God damn, the hitboxes are atrocious in this game, I'd like to point out that most of the time in the Mech is walking, and when you've nothing to do in this barren wasteland you can either; skip your music playlist which can be loaded into the game by some means necessary, or you can shoot your grapple. After seconds of playfull grapple shooting, you can quickly realise how awful the hitboxes are, it's near impossible to interact with the environment when there's tiny enemies running around. You have no choice but to watch them scurry away when most of the premise of the beginning of the game is to destroy every last one of them.  I wouldn't mind this so much, however later in the game it's necessary to grapple to certain areas to access specific locations, to do this you enter an invisible mini-game which requires you to run around aimlessly for 2 minutes shooting your grapple at any chance you get in any hopes to actually hit the target box. The hitboxes are so miniscle that it's near impossible to escape areas which are written in the storyline.  I've played enough games now to understand collection quests, that said the T-Energy collection modules are so underworked that the process of collection is ridding any enemies nearby then holding a key/or button for 1 minute straight. God help you if you let go or get attacked because you'll reset the system and there's no getting that T-Energy unless you boot up the system and restart from the beginning.  That's not the only thing that's underworked, repair system is a matter of swivelling the joysticks around untill you match them with the desired time on the invisible clock. God forbid Spark unlimited and Capcom actually write on those whiteboards a decent method or minigame to repair something that needs fixed, I'm no expert in advanced Mech's however I'd guess that repairing doesn't involve swivelling one wrench so a bolt is facing a certain direction, give me some wires to cut damnit! How about if I cut the wrong wire I'd have lost a function in my Mech...  As I'm talking about Mechs, I don't understand how this company has invested Billions to ship out these mercenaries and advanced robotics to combat the dangers and obstacles in the Lost Planet only to find that they're equipped only with drills and grappling hooks. Surely they could spend a few thousand to equip them with some firepower?  This is all negative so far however the character interaction is great, I love the interactions between Jim and Gale, the voice acting is superb despite a few lack of interaction between the shops as they only have one responce for specific items and when purchasing sounds like a broken record. The animation is less than desired but the dialogue really picks up the slack. That said, nothing can subsitute the absolute lack of humanization they barely gave the Princess, Mira. It's almost like they forgot to give her animation, her movements are so robotic and disconnected from the scenes. I'd also like to point out that Mira's recording responce was used twice in one scene to move along a conversation...  I enjoyed the game despite it's flaws, it does feel like a rushed project however. It was worth the £1 spend, but nothing more than a few quid extra.",

But this game has 3 major problems: - the playing area is very tiny. there is 4-5 main areas you are returning to over and over again. You walk across one area in 30 seconds, so yeah - it's really tiny. No feeling of being on the huge planet. - boss fighting is repetetive and very boring. you have to shoot 'red' area like 50 times to destroy it. Boss have 2-4 of those areas and when you are killed, you begin from the start (probably with unskipable cutscene). I kill the final boss on 10th try. It wasn't frustrating - it was just very very boring. - the whole world feels dead. Everybody is standing on the same position, nothing is going on outside (except some weather change) and the tinyness of the whole world feels like you are in some test area with few tunnels, caves and clifs.  I known that this game doesn't have very good reviews, but I bought it nevertheless. I like the atmosphere of huge mech in caves on frozen planet. First 15-20 minutes fullfill this expectation, but then you realize the boundaries and the atmosphere is lost. It's a shame. The environment has good potential.  If you are 'finisher' as myself, you will enjoy the first hour. Than you will be just 'finishing the game'. If you are able to throw the game to the trash after first 1-2 hours, than you will enjoy this game (-:",

Just download the HD videos and verify your game files once the download is complete &amp; some files may need to be redownloaded then the bink crash stops. Somewhere along the way I downloaded a different version of bink32.dll (see the thread) but I'm not sure what version exactly because there are about 10 of them and I can't remember so you'll have to try all of them hahaha. Which ultimately may not be necessary.   So where do you get the hd videos well I'll throw you a bone in the DLC section for this game.   So I played the intro about 20 times trying to figure out how to stop this crashing and annoyingly the autosave (only) saves at a point where you have to shoot a bunch of akrid before a cutscene.   The other annoying thing is that it takes 1 minute 25 seconds to get through the splash screens alone and they can't be skipped. You have to make a short cut with some parameter that I'm going to have to look up again.   Once you get through all that the game seems to be a relatively straightforward 'hold down your left mouse button and it will complete from start to finish' fps. It was so worth the hassle.",

Roller akrids will stop aiming at you if you side dodge no matter how far away. -No jump button so you often have to take the long away around knee high rubble. -No crouch button, it happens automatically and takes away your ability to shoot to be 'cinematic' -Can't use grapple hook whenever you want, only when prompted by QTE. -Can't fall off ledges or fall to your death, invisible walls everywhere. -Stupid random QTE sequences with generic enemies and environment that aren't fun. -Spaghetti space western atmosphere in how people talk and in the music. I hate that crap personally. -No 'VS' to pilot, only the 'rig' which is for QTE boss fights, environmental QTE and slooooow mandatory transportation. -Unnecessary hub at base and 'open world' that's really not very open but just waste your time. -Screen jelly HP regen, T-Eng no longer keeps you alive, it's just a form of currency to buy stuff. -Characters are generic and unattractive. Lack of Japanese design philosophy shows and no one is iconic looking. -Akrids all look worse than previous games, once again, lack of Japanese design philosophy. -Story was giving off some Dead Space vibe but not sure if it elaborates on it or not since I quit playing. -No cool boss fights. I left the best for last because Lost Planet has always been known for awesome bosses.  In conclusion, I much prefer the Japanese developed LP1/LP2 which are quirky, imperfect but FUN and replayable. If you like Japanese game design more then you'll probably despise Lost Planet 3 with every fibre of your being. It abandons the arcade shooter roots, the cool boss fights, the over the top action and the cool mechs. This game is definitely aimed more toward the crowd who loves 'narrative driven cinematic experiences' and doesn't mind having their hand held with mediocre gameplay. If you come into this game only caring about the story you'll probably have a good time judging by some of the positive reviews.",
