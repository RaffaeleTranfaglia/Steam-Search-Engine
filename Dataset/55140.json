Boasting an excellent physics engine not far behind that of the DIRT series, an eclectic seletion of vehicles from the lightest motocross bikes to large trophy trucks, and a comprehensive range of offroad environments, this game just gets it right in so many ways. Apart from some minor oversight in labeling gamepad controls, this title can be played comfortably with either a controller or mouse and keyboard. If you want some good old THQ extreme sports gameplay, look no further. MX vs ATV Reflex is a solid 9/10 ",

            "review_text": "It looks like it could be good, I don't really know how good because were MX vs ATV's unleashed you can use a joystick, here you can't. Even though it is not mentioned in the store page, there is no use of joystick here. Only the keyboard, or a PS4 or X-box game pad. And I am only asumming the pad because I do not own the $80.00 controller. I just own a $19.00 Logitech Attack 3 joyy stick that has worked prefactly in every way in MX vs ATV's unleashed. In MX vs ATV's unleashed you can assign pratcially anything to anything including use of mixed buttons on the joystick. How ever You can not in MX vs ATV Reflex. The selections are a little confuseing and tricky. It's like the dev was confussed in his own work and tried to make it simple for him to understand what to do.  The graphics look better than MX vs ATV's unleashed and...... and........ and.... well THQ are Hoda fans because it starts you out with a red bike... and.... and..... hummmm.... Well do to the controller issue unlike MX vs ATV unleashed I can't tell you more, so If you get this game, make sure you have a PS4 or X-BOX controller frist, because if your useing your cheap, economy, affordable in this day and age, happy joystick , it will not work in this game at all. If is not getting recomended because of this. Glad I paid $3.00 for the game, I hate be the foolish sucker and get it at full price and be stuck with it doing nothing. All this over a controller... tsk, tsk, sad... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: 01/06/2016  The game is very cool, the graphics and effects are very impressive. Now I have a proper controller I can now tell more.. The map lay outs are very good, but I discovered in the game the key board and mouse deal is not going to work out at all, you really do need the controller, way more efficent improvment. How ever were MX vs ATV's unleashed is closer to real handling, this game not so much. You really have to work with it. For example on jumps and wip de-do's your bike tends to fall forward and hard at times to get it back straight for some reason, not to mention the fight to keep it straight at times going over these objects.  The only free ride so far I found was a off trail map, which is fine to learn your bike for better handling, but not so much help for you to get pratice on the tracks were you need it the most. Mainly since your bike rides like the track is held in zero-G. So it requiers time, I already had played on the MP level with another player, it was fun, but since there is no way to pratice on a race track like you can in MX vs ATV's unleashed, I kept finding myself accdently hitting the other rider as if my bike was magniticly drawn to him. causeing him to chrash for not. So the riding handling is way more steeper than a real dirt bike. But in time I am sure this would straighten out maybe. The other thing is cheat codes can be applied, I do not know if they are used only for the single player mod, or can be used for both single player and MP.   Over all it was a good game. So in the end, with mixed emotions, I will give a thumbs up for the effert by Nordic games, But due to some issues of ridiculos handling that I never had a problem on the real thing, not to mention you are supose to be able to bind the controller functions, but it dosen't let you do re-binds, and a need for cheat codes, I am still not going to recommend the game, but I am also not going to say don't buy it either. So really, it will be up to you, is this your kind of game? or not.   But I will recomend the game pad controller. GPX ThrustMaster, it is licensed officaly through Microsoft, for the X-box 360 and PC compatable. Cost me $29.99. You can probably order it through 'Game Stop', I got it at Amazon..",

It isn't the kind of racing game that relies on how fast you go and how good your vehicle is, but instead is reliant on how you time your jumps and turns. It has a lot of veriety and even when you're done theres a ton of mods out there. It's a shame the series became extremely arcady and careless as far as the PC versions go.  As someone who owns an ATV and a dirt bike, I felt like this game handeled how it made those two work. Mostly the dirt bikes though, not so much the ATV's, as the ATV's are basically just the MX but with slight differences when it comes to this game.  Lots of pointless stuff too. If you want to complete moto-career 100% you need to race in Sports Trucks, Buggys, and UTV's which are no where near as much fun as the ATV's and MX (at least when it comes to video games), but it's totally optional stuff.  Also, this game has some very impressive physics that hold up to this day, all though the graphics themself don't really look all too good as they did years ago.",

Other than that, I find it a great game to listen to a podcast on top of.",

Possibly the best (most involving) dirtbike control and physics yet in any game. Although, major dissapointment with the game mentioning each class being open to 2-stroke bikes and various engine sizes - There are no 2 stroke bikes! The real life MXGP is open to these bikes yet doesnt actually have any in the either class. The developers should not have listed 2 strokes and some of the smaller engine displacements in the class menu as this is misleading to gamers who have played the demo or bought the game!   From playing the Demo I was under the impression that there were many bikes with individual handeling and engine characteristics , I WAS HANGING FOR 2 STROKE EXPERIENCE- Major flaw and dissapointment. game retail should be $15-$20.   Probably best to just walk away and buy a real 2 stroke bike... why do games always fall short and leave out essential elemnts that whould make a game. would be nice to at least see a 2 stroke addon with bikes coded to replicate true power band.",

Its graphics really bring you into the action. The controls are wonderful with the Xbox Controller. You can play online with friends but playing online with other people is out of the option since its dead. The gameplay is great but towards the end can feel repetitive. The cut-scenes were you get your trophy all feel the same. There is a free ride mode in a couple of areas around the world which make it fun to get familiar with the mechanics of the game. The freestyle competitions are fun and arent hard to win. You have a couple options to choose from when racing from trucks to moto bikes there is enough to keep you satisfied. You can customize your characters look, number, and jersey name. There is alot to this game, I have really enjoyed playing it and if your into this type of racing I know you will too",

More of an arcade feel here, not so much simulation, but achieves a certain level of realism.  Sure, there's a couple issues, like most games...   Pros: HEAVY METAL SOUNDTRACK \\m/ Relatively fun, somewhat intuitive controls* Lots of vehicles (choice of flavors, rather.) Pretty deep character cusomization (wish I could say the same for vehicles) Lots of events, with varying difficulty levels Tear it up in open world like areas (always a great feature)  Cons: The physics can be a bit wonky, making the intutive control concept a little difficult to pick up right away. Tricks can be difficult. Audio mix seems off, or lacking quality/depth at times (soundtrack still sounds good though) Some event tracks are repeated for different events in career mode. Seems lazy. A relatively small number of areas in game lack polish, and possibly optimization.   I haven't tried any multiplayer modes.  I picked up this game on sale, and it was totally worth it for just the soundtrack.   If you don't have a MX or ATV game on steam, and it's on sale, pick it up!",
