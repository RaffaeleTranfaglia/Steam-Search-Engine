    "description": "HIKIBYOU2 is an action/adventure platfomer with puzzle and stealth elements. A bit of what differentiates itself from the first title in the series, Hikikomori No Chuunibyou, is this successor's less realistic approach and more atmospheric vibe. Levels are once again open-ended with the story directing the player.",
