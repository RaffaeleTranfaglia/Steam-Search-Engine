            "review_text": "A great game given new life. A couple of hints to improve gameplay. The game only runs slow because the CPU cycles in dosboox are set too low by default. To change this hit alt-enter while in game. This makes the window smaller so you can see the CPU count on the top left, it should read 3000. Hit Ctrl-F12 many times till it reaches a smooth frame rate, this is around 52301 for me. Hit alt-enter to return to full screen.  Alt-S turns sound on and off in game.  F10 allows the detail levels to be set higher.  In campaign mode your supply and bombard task forces will change speed as they approach Henderson field without you ordering it. This is not a bug, this is done automatically by the computer to allow your ships to reach Guadalcanal at nighttime to avoid air attack.  There is a new patch update to the game which fixes some waypoint issues and comes with the manual.   Many times in battle, ships or columns under your control will not do what you want. Usually this happens when ships in formation take damage lose speed, jam their rudders or swerve to avoid damaged ships. It is frustrating but realistically frustrating! The enjoyable part of this game for me is trying to keep the task force in organized-order throughout the battle. This rarely happens. It is easier to do this in later battles as the Americans as they have radar and can detect and fire upon the Japanese out of visual range.  If Japanese destroyers see you and illuminate you with flares, you will have torpedoes hitting you within a couple of minutes. Then you will die.  The ships and shells are really 3d not sprites. This means ships are damaged where they are hit and shells are tracked individually on their trajectory as they leave the guns all the way hit or miss.  If you were frustrated or appalled the first time you saw this game read the manual play the tutorial and work yourself into it.       ",
