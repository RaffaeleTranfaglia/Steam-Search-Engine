    "description": "Just got back from Pax East 2018. With 1000+ people playing it they found some &quot;bugs&quot; which we call features. We will be addressing them and uploading a patch by end of the week. Thanks for playing MiniBotz, we appreciate your support and understanding as we build our first game.",
