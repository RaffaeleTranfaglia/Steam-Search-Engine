    "description": "Yes, it's the game literally... SOME of you asked for! And so, in the spirit of &quot;well, alright then, if you insist...&quot; we present the third game in the Carmageddon series, in the knowledge that some of you Carma fans out there would like to have a complete Carmageddon collection in your Steam library. Nothing wrong with that.",

Did look much and much better than the other 2 games.  Why .... very simple.....  The game has not the same controls... it has lost his soul if you ask me.  Buy if you like to have... or buy part 1 and 2 and skip this crap.  I give it a 4/10.",

I see comments like 'aww nig the times capped to 5 mins taht means dont buy this game.'. Do you have downsyndrome? Also many people keep b*tching about how the game is different. No f*cking sh*t. Obviously it is going to be different since it is the fourth game in the series and it has been made by a different f*cking developer... If anything I think this game is actually better in some ways than the previous games. It has a sh*t tone of vehicles that are actually unique with different handling, many different maps and missions to choose from, customizable vehicles (paint and upgrades), missions that actually show you what to do instead of you having to f*cking figure out everything you need to do. This game is decent. Still don't know why people are b*tching lel. F*cking fanboys say anything is sh*t if it's even slightly different.",

            "review_text": "Ever since the first Carmageddon back during the DOS days, I have been a huge fan of the series. A racing game where, you not only bash into other cars in a 'Free For All' demolition durby race to the finish, but you also get to run over people. A game where killing pedestrians also gives you points and money.  In this game, the races are super brutal. More cars, more tracks, bigger maps, and more people to run over. I still own the original game, which was made back for Windows 98.  In this game, as well as it's previous games, you are in an all out race to not only win, but to survive. Although there are very little weapons, so to speak, the real point is to crash and bash. The more you destroy, the more points and money you make. Destroy your opponents, run over peds, pick up money icons, finishing a race, all earn you money in the end.  Because this was redesigned for Steam, you shouold know, even when this was made, there were a few bugs that caused the game to crash once in a while. So, if you get this game, save often.",
