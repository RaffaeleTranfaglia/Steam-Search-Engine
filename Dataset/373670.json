            "review_text": "The gameplay and graphics are quite nice, but at the moment there are way too many flaws to give this game a good review!  First of all, I had to run the game in Windows XP compatability mode to get it even started. Second, it somehow doesnt scale right. So I had to run it on 1024x768 desktop resolution. And third, it isn't even running smooth at all. It almost feels like it's lagging when there's much action going on. And it often is hard to keep track of what's happening.  The soundtrack is kind of okay-ish. Hopefully I'm gonna get to edit my review, as the developers are updating the game.",
