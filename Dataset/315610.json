            "review_text": "Spud's Quest is an absolute gem and incredible value for money.  Story:  This spud, this potato, this bit of a vegetable, this starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanumtuberosum L. He's an every man, an every spud. Just a normal guy, until...a frog falls through the roof. I know, I know, cliche or what! Passe! But wait, he's no normal frog he's a prince. This frog formally known as prince is in a bit of bother, his whole royal family has been turned into little amphibians by an evil wizard and it's up to you to make things right.  That's your story in a nutshell pretty much, that's your raison d'être anyway, but everything else story wise comes from the absolutely crazy amount of characters throughout the game. Not that is fleshes out the story in any meaningful way in fact most of the characters in the game seem almost solipsistic in their narrow mindedness, it's humorous though and it's clear the creator of this game is from the Midlands (as am I) the humor is acerbic and very dead pan, I can't actually think of a time a character was glad to see me, quick though they are to ask for something, typical isn't it. Anyway, the writing is mature, funny and self aware something you can't say about most games nowadays especially in this genre. I'm gonna knock out a terribly reductive word to describe the story of this game, 'charming'. It's true though, it's really charming but I mean it in the truest sense of the word you'll know what I mean after playing it.  Presentation:  CHARMING! Oh sorry, where was I, the game looks beautiful, it's all 2D and sprite-y with sprites! It feels so thoughtful in the way it looks, like every aspect of the level design was pored over with utter love and care. It's a labour of love and it shows throughout. Spud himself is a bundle of determination, every aspect of his being shows he's capable of anything,the fact that he's been dragged into all this pretty much against his will is not enough to put this guy off, all of this shown through some fantastic artwork and this doesn't just apply to spud himself, the whole game oozes with character, every screen is beautifully realised and the variety is pretty outstanding, green and joyful one moment, dark and decrepit the next. The world that surrounds Spud is expansive and ever full of intrigue.  The music is also wonderful and evocative, it easily matches the quality of the visuals to create a incredibly polished package. That's whats so unbelievable about this game it's created by one person, mental.  Gameplay:  It's all good so far, I'd even go as far as to say it's great but platforming games are difficult to perfect, everything has to feel just right, it doesn't matter if it looks great, sounds great and has a good story if your platformer doesn't platform correctly then it's all for naught. Thankfully it's super responsive, it feels exacting and precise in a way few platformers manage, I'm looking at you Littlebigplanet you big load of float.  Spud handles superbly, other than being able to jump he can throw things, when I say 'things' that's because I'm not sure what it is he is throwing, but by god can he throw them, and when you throw whatever it is he is throwing into water, the water splashes! I don't know why that matters so much but it's the sort of thing you expect to be missing, mainly because it doesn't matter if the water splashes but it does splash and that makes me happy, okay? He can also climb, pull blocks and flip switches he's a swiss army spud. His froggy chum can also interact with things which comes in handy when solving puzzles, puzzles play a big part of this game mainly because that's where the challenge comes from. They're bloody difficult too, it also makes this game indefinite in length, who's to say you'll solve a certain puzzle, at all! Good luck cheating your way through with a walkthrough and believe me I tried, at the time of writing this I can't find any definite solutions, even the people on the Spud's Quest forum talk in riddles as to not ruin the challenge. I'm glad of it actually, it's hard but fair and 99% of the time the solution was staring me in the face but I was just too daft to see it. When you do solve something you either get that lovely warm gloaty feeling when solving something difficult, the rest of the time you feel like a prat for not getting it sooner, either way the puzzles are enjoyable in their variety, they also make story sense, you're not unlocking a door by solving puzzles with matchsticks or something silly like that. You're in ancient tombs kicking around Goonies style.  BUY IT!",

            "review_text": "This game is absolutely awesome! It's very reminiscent of the old Dizzy adventure games and using simple SNES-like graphics which really do work very well with this kind of game. There's plenty of things to do, lots of fetch quests to keep you busy, and hidden items that will have you tearing your hair out trying to find the last one. It's an adventure full of traps and treasures like in the Indiana Jones movies. All in all it's how games should still be as it's equally fun and frustrating at the same time and isn't using overpowered graphics like a lot of modern games do, and has lots of cheerful ditties. It's a game all ages can enjoy. I can't recommend this any more than this. Buy it, you'll never regret it, and it's only less than £6! It's a bargain to be had.",
