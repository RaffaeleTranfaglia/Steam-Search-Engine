            "review_text": "This is going to be easy. Do you like logic puzzles? If yes, then Mathew Brown, the developer of SquareCells and HexCells, is your best friend. Tip him the cup of coffee this game costs, you can't go wrong.  This is a simple, short, no nonsense puzzle game in a minimalist package. You can call it a cross between picross and minesweeper if you want, but the important thing here is: it's neither. With just a couple of tiny changes in the mechanics, SquareCells actually forces even veteran puzzle solvers to step out of their comfort zone and start thinking for a couple of hours.   The game is deviously smart in its simplicity and, as always with this dev's puzzles, absolutely logical at all points. If you can't find a solution, think harder, it is staring you right in the face. (Or get a tip by listening to the explanations in Innocentive's  video guides  - they will help you figure out that one logical step you're missing. Cause puzzle 35 is mean I tell you!) There are only 36 puzzles to solve, with none of them being throw-away easy, even at the beginning. In fact most of them are just difficult enough to make you scratch your head for a few minutes before you start feeling smug about how smart you are for solving them. I appreciate a puzzle that lets me feel smug. :)  Like Hexcells previously, this is a Unity game, without any frills, with nicely forgettable (and mutable) ambient music, but with some nice little touches that prove attention to detail. Zero complaints all around. Now when is the next one coming so I can throw some more money at you Mr. Brown?",

            "review_text": " Squarecells , another excellent ambient logic puzzle game created by Matthew Brown (of  Hexcells  fame). This has the same level of originality as we have came to expect from the developer and just like the  Hexcells  series, it doesn't disappoint.   If you haven't played the aforementioned games before, this game could be compared to a mixture of minesweeper and picross. The puzzles are complex in design, but all possible to solve without making any errors if you take your time to think about the logical moves to make next.   As with all of Matthew Brown's other games, this is very well polished, relaxing and worth the asking price. If you liked  Hexcells , you'd definitely be wise to add  Squarecells  to your library too.",

            "review_text": "SquareCells is a puzzle game (and the sequel to the Hexcells series, in case you played those). Deductive logic is at the core of it all: You are presented with a matrix of coloured squares and it's up to you to figure out which ones need to go and which ones can stay. Your only help in this task is a bunch of numbers both on, around and below the matrix. These numbers give you just enough info to figure out the rest on your own. They may inform you how many connected squares there are in a row, or column. Or of how many connected squares an area within the matrix consists. Or how many squares in general still need to go. You will have to pay attention to all of these, and then it will be possible to solve each puzzle entirely with brain power. Guessing is never necessary. The game starts off easy and gets pretty hard towards the end. In the later levels, sometimes you're expected to think a few steps ahead. In case that got too taxing, I found it helpful to take a screenshot and draw 'what if' scenarios on them (this might just help if you can't wrap your head around a solution, hint, hint). This game may make you feel stupid sometimes but it's rewarding when you finally figure it out. If your strong suits are logic and tenacity, I can give a recommendation.",

I missed more achievements like getting 1,5,10,25,50 Stars or for each 2-3 levels a step achievement, but i am fine with 7 achievements in 1 hour, you maybe play 2-3 hours, so maybe you use a little discount, but price is fair.

It has different elements than Hexcells, and they are more difficult to get a grasp on. But by no means does that make this a bad game. I can't put into words how much I love this game, and how much I love the Hexcells trilogy, and how much I love Matthew Brown...okay, is that too weird? Sorry.  Anyways, there are three main 'rules' to this game. 1: Squares do not connect diagonally. 2: Numbers without brackets indicate the order blocks that are part of the pattern are in. 3: Numbers with brackets indicate only the number of blocks in the row, not the order they are in. 4: Numbers on blocks indicate that that block is a part of a group of blocks the size of the number shown.   I guess that was four rules...so yeah. Seems simple, right? WRONG! These puzzles are delightfully challenging, especially the second half. The thing is, there's no guesswork involved. You just have to use pure logic to solve them. And logic is similar to common sense, of which I have none, so I'm not the greatest at the game. But I'm okay with that, I still love it to death.  I can't wait for a sequel or two of this series, hence my question at the beginning. Matthew Brown is, in my opinion, one of the best puzzle game developers of all time.  ",

            "review_text": "This game is a mix between nonograms (or Picross if you know that one) and Hexcells. I love both of those and SquareCells cancels the main problem nonograms have out. Nonograms tend to get easier the closer you get to their solution. SquareCells doesn't do that.  So how does it work? At the beginning of each puzzle, you see a grid with coloured square blocks. In each column and line there is a set amount of blocks that need to be marked while the rest needs to be removed. Nonograms work the same way but they normally give you the exact number of blocks that need to be marked in each column and line and even tell you how they are connected. But as you can see on the screenshots, SquareCells doesn't do that all the time. Instead it gives you other hints like a number directly on the blocks themselves. That means a set number of marked blocks are connected to the one with the number on it. Or maybe there is a number in brackets next to a line, which means that in this line there are x number of blocks to be marked, but their connection to each other is not clear. Later in the game even the counter below the puzzle, which tells how many blocks still need to be removed, is to be considered.  The game does a very good job of introducing the player to its rules and it gets progressively harder. It's hard for me to tell, whether the difficulty of the last puzzles of SquareCells is on par with the difficulty of the last ones in Hexcells Infinite but they are definitely not easy.  But SquareCells also has one or two things, that might be a problem for you. Hexcells Infinite had a random puzzle generator which SquareCells doesn't have. Personally, I don't care about that, because the randomly generated puzzles in Hexcells weren't as challenging as the rest of the game and I found them boring most of the time. Another thing is the colour scheme of the game. In my opinion the marked blocks don't distinct themselves very well from the not marked ones. After staring at a puzzle for a few minutes, it almost gives me a headache distinguishing the marked blocks from the normal ones. Mr. Matthew Brown patched a dark colour scheme option into the game recently and this helps a little bit with that issue but more contrast between marked and not marked blocks would still be nice.  All in all I really enjoyed SquareCells and I hope there will be another one. Please Mr. Brown :), I would buy it without hesitation.",
