            "review_text": "Overall a really good game.  It took me only 1.5 hours to beat it, so heads up there for anyone who is worried about value. However, the game is worth playing through.  The controls feel tight and responsive, though there are times in the game where the game can feel a frustrating due to the controls. For example, it feels like the character has a tendency to slide off of edges. Most frustrating is when you are trying to grab onto a small ledge, and the game doesn't recognize that you have grabbed onto the ledge, resulting on an 'unfair' death.  The story in the game is interesting and sweet, though I am not really sure what was the point or what was trying to be said. The game also feels a need to have chalk drawings that show you how to do everything and where to go. These can be helpful, but I'm not sure why they are there. I feel the pacing of the game is a bit off at times or as if the game was missing a few puzzles, but these comment isn't game breaking in any way.  The art and sound are beautiful throughout. My biggest complaint with the art is that sometimes (often) it is hard to tell what the Player path is and what the foreground and background elements are. In a couple of puzzles it took some guess work to find out what I was supposed to jump on.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed this game. It could be difficult at times with the timing in the platform puzzles. But it made completing them that much more rewarding. The music is epic and loud when needed but also relaxing as well. I could listen to it all the time. It is also a gorgeous looking game. The art design is simple in ways but there were times I just wanted to stop and stare at what was going on in the background as well. I recommend this game if you like platforming puzzle games. There are challenging rooms with timing jumps just right with what is going on as well as simple stealth areas.",

            "review_text": "I just completed the game. $15 for a 1-2 hour adventure? I feel ripped off. I will admit, the animation in the game is spectacular, but if I wanted to pay to see art I would go to a gallery.  Fossil Echo can be challenging, and I consider myself competent with platform games thanks to the good ol' SNES. However, as the stages progressed, I began to realize some of my deaths were not even my fault. The character likes to forget he's able to cling to ledges and instead falls to his doom. This thing in particular caused much frustration. There are also optional stages (one of which I accidentally skipped) that send you to flashbacks in Momento order. The final flashback (technically the first part of the story) shows what the adventure had all been for with a suspensful cutscene, leading up to the extremely anti-climactic ending that I don't dare give away.  All in all, this game is pretty, but needs more content to be worth its price.",

            "review_text": "I played this though the first few campfire scenes before stopping. Really, really don't recommend. The graphics are lovely and the music is fitting, but that's about it. The gameplay is tedious, frustrating, and repetitive. The archways with the glowing insignia lead to especially irritating jump sequences and are easy to accidentally pass by without realizing that you can't get back to them once you've walked pass. It feels like the developers wanted to create a short animated film but threw in some nominal gameplay just for the heck of it. If you want to play a well-developed stealth platformer with a great story and graphics, go check out 'Mark of the Ninja' instead.",
