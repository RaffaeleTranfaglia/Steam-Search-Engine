            "review_text": "I'm a sucker for the post-apocalypse genre - the grittier, the better - and thus this game looked really promising. Unfortunately, I ended up being severely disappointed.  At first, the setting and mood was excellent, kinda like The Road (although thankfully not THAT harsh). I actually liked the stamina mechanism, too. In most games, your character is apparently a machine who can run/climb/fight/whine for hours without breaking a sweat, so such a nod to realism also got things started on the right foot. Graphics I didn't have much problem with, either. Hell, I grew up in the NES era, so I can forgive a lot on that score.  Unfortunately, I Am Alive went downhill pretty quickly from there. It's funny that I mentioned the NES, because this game actually reminded me of the old NES games... in all the worst ways.   It LOOKS like a GTA/Fallout-style open world at first, but looks are deceiving. I Am Alive is actually a linear game with constant barriers to keep you moving more or less along the one path. It's bitter that such an open-looking 3D world would offer so little room for exploration or experimentation.  Looking at the map for the first time (before I became aware of this game's true nature), I actually wondered which streets I should take to the apartment. I thought 'Okay, let's try those back streets, maybe less chance of being spotted by hostiles...' I soon learned that this game isn't big on exploration (or choices). That linear nature extended to the encounters, too. All too often, it felt like there was only one method or sequence to resolve things, with any other approach being punished brutally.  That latter issue is made exponentially worse by the SAVE POINT SYSTEM. Even better, with limited retries! This is what nailed this game's coffin shut for me, the realization that this game came out in 2012 and oh wow, game designers STILL hadn't learned better than this idiocy.  NO. This is no longer 1984 where you have to fit your entire game in 4 megabytes and I'm still a kid with enough free time to waste hours replaying the same fricking map over and over. If you want to encourage players to get through the game in less than X lives in one sitting, then hey, great. Make an achievement or a score bonus or a 'hardcore mode' or whatever for it. But don't punish those of us who aren't masochists with nothing more interesting to do.  You might think I'm a little hypocritical here, because I love roguelikes, which usually have permadeath and make you start over with a new character if you die. But the better ones (DCSS, DoomRL, ADOM, Sword of the Stars: The Pit) have random dungeons and classes that are very different from each other, so at least you can try something new if you die, with tons of room for exploration or just going some other way. I Am Alive should have borrowed more from that playbook if it wanted to be so harsh.  TL;DR: This game is frustrating, stupidly linear, and has save points. Avoid.",

            "review_text": "Lets start with the good things as there are few. 1. The levels itself - are in itself atmospheric, it really gives you the impression how a town could look like after a series of earthquakes. 2. The climbing mechanic - that you loose endurance/stamina if you climb is a nice change. 3. Overall interesting take on survival in a town after a global catastrophic event - without the obligatory zombies.  Yeah...that's it.  Now to go on with the bad things where do I start: The graphics are washed up and even if you use the highest settings you can't change the fact that this piece of crap was meant to be played on an XBOX or PS2. Yes I know - it is developed for the XBOX 360 and PS3 but I can't drop the feeling that I have seen better graphics in part on a XBOX or PS2. The music at the beginning is good and adds to the little bit of atmosphere there is at all - but it gets so repetitive after a time (especially as you loose stamina constantly and with you loosing stamina the music builds up and always the same tune) that you sometimes just want to mute the whole game. So now we know that the game itself is just a common stone between pearls and diamonds in terms of audio and graphics, but there are these rare jewels that suck at this too but still have great gameplay and story. This game is absolutely NOT one of them. The gameplay is overall horrific with the exception of the climbing mechanic. Combat or stealth - it gives you no choice - you have to fight.  There is no sneaking (although they implemeted the sneak button how cool is that) at all, the moment you pass a certain point the game spawns enemies and you can not get around them either because they detect you on the spot or you desperately try to get by the ones that are already somewhere in the level - and the level is created so that you have to get through them.  This is no 'THIEF' at all.  So lets 'fight' which comes down to coerce the AI in getting stuck or other 'special' movements. Why?  Because you either have guns - for which you practically never have any ammunition or you can use your mighty machete. Nonono, not hacking and slashing, you have to wait until your enemies have reached you and then you can draw your machete for one hit. If it is someone with a machete he will block it and you have to go through button smashing, it is easier if the enemy has a gun, then no button smashing. The only problem is that these guys come in packs.  So the moment you have to buttonsmash and are locked in the scripted killscene, our enemies friends are hacking you to pieces OR his gun equipped buddies just kill you with one shot (ok,ok @ higher difficulty) The AI can shoot at you forever but if you loot them they magically have emptied everything they had after 1001 shots (one of the many bugs in this game shows you that fact when you get stuck somewhere in a wall and they use you as invincible target practice or you just run around eating up your health items just to see how often they can fire) if you are lucky there is one bullet left after you killed them, about 50% of the time the gun is empty although the owner of it WILL kill you with it if you believe that you could reload the level and just walk past by him. Yes I have the feeling that the people working at this game desperately wanted to shoot themeselves after they saw what they had created and implemented this thoughtful underlying message of the last bullet. You can get a shotgun in the game but first you really have to do some climbing and exploring and the few shots you have are the only ones in the whole game. After around 75% of the game you get a bow with one arrow - oh and you won't believe it - YES!! you can reuse that arrow.   The story is pretty mediocre, you should have encountered it somewhere else already and probably better told but worst of all it is pretty shortlived (around 8 hours and I took my sweet time) and cut at the end. The ending is one bad joke.  I couldn't help but think that at some point of production they really believed they had born a new superloved AAA title hence the dream of producing dlcs and a second game. But when at the end they realized what a boring abomination they helped to bring into this gamingworld they just hurried up and forced some kind of ending in and a really bad one too.  The bottom line is that if you really want to try out this game buy it in a Steam Sale...for up to 3 $/€.  Anything more will make you wish you had tossed that money in a blender and watched it blend - more entertainment for the buck.",

There is NO FOV SETTING in the game, so if you tend to suffer from motion sickness induced by low FOV, this is not your game. There are hacks available, though. On the plus side, the game does not appear to have motion blur. There are several issues with the game, such as the controls not remappable separately, but only as a group (e.g. 'Drop/Draw Weapon'). And since 'Fire' and 'Run' are in the same group, that is really annoying. Another issue (and ultimately the one that leads me to not recommending the game) is that the game streams in world data, and when it does that, it sometimes stops responding to mouse input. This can go away within moments, but on occasion it stays. As a result, your mouse cursor will be fixed to the centre of the screen, in menus as well as in Windows when tabbed out. Even killing the game process doesn't seem to fix it, only a system reboot will do. I tried to like the game, but it's just not enjoyable.",

One day you return to it and you can't get in sync with what you had in mind. That sort of thing is what this game feels like. Atleast I can say the premise and idea is good, but I really can't figure out anything else good to say.  All characters are flat because the game is infatuated with setpieces (I hope you like grey!) and trying to force emotions and exposition onto the player. I find an older man coughing that needs an inhaler, and I move on since I don't have one. Logic tells me there's one close by and as I move on the man says 'I guess you want to help me but just can't yet'. There's no understanding of immersive dialogue here. When I get him the inhaler he starts to spout exposition like everything in the game seems to want to. 'Lemme guess, you wanna know more about the event right?' No I'm looking for medicine.  The very flow of the way everything comes at you is so unnatural. It feels like someone wrote a story that won't work so it was half-♥♥♥♥♥ into a game. Heck there's enough hipsters in gaming that some would say it's well done. It's like someone makes a little game and tells you to try it and say you can explore on your own. Although the moment you go left where they'd prepared an event to the right, the guy rips the controller from your hands and says, 'oh no no, you don't want that. Look over here is something cool'... In my exploring the game literally gave me a prompt 'You weren't supposed to go this way, turn back.' Gees.. let me just look around.  From the very beginning the camera is a problem and game has tons of technical issues. Every gameplay aspect is so on rails, rinse and repeat. This game was looking interesting when announced way back, but it went through a lot of reworking and it's easy to see it's become a leather faced abomination. Everything game-like is lacking and drowning in the game's pretentiousness.  I'd say i've already said too much about this game, when there's not much worth mentioning.  I Am Alive is incredibly pretentious and poorly designed, executed and unfinished. The end. I don't enjoy slamming a game when it's gifted to me, but at the end of the day I gotta be honest.",

On the good side, the story can be interesting and it's a fresh change from zombie apocalypse. Confrontations can also sometimes feel rewarding if you outsmart a group. The problem is that these good parts are rare. While the game teaches you the basics of combat early on, it also defies these at times. Also, the ending was horribly underwhelming.  Confrontations: The game does a great job early on of showing you ways of dealing with multiple people and when you are underpowered (lacking ammunition for your gun) but it breaks many of the conventions established early on. For example, the enemy will rarely recognize the bow and arrow as a weapon and so, rather than stopping, they keep charging you. The enemy will also, after a while, charge you when you have a gun out (believing you have no bullets). This breaks the mechanic of shoving the enemy into fire or off cliffs since it takes so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to maneuver them into position while keeping your crosshairs on all the enemies. Another issue is enemy spawning. One particular sequence annoyed me to no end. You had to walk forward and get the attention of one group before a second group would open an impenetrable door and attack you from behind. You weren't allowed to sneak past one group or deal with them one at a time; you were forced to let them flank you.  Puzzles: The game has a lot of climbing and maneuvering puzzles. I actually think this is its best quality and wish the game consisted purely of these sorts of puzzles and left out the clunky combat. Your climbing time is restricted by your stamina, which decreases over time as you climb. The first problem with this is that your character is incredibly difficult to control while climbing. I routinely found myself shifting along edges when I was pressing down to slide down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pole I was clinging to! Secondly, climbing is introduced in one of the hardest climbing puzzles in the game. With no guide or direction, the player has to complete one of the longest and hardest to deduce climbing paths in the game.  Story: The story is pretty generic, but by the end I had some hope for it. We were saying goodbye to some main characters and the protagonist renewed his effort to reunite with his wife. And then the game ended. The game progressed to a state where, while not great, it was certainly improving. But instead of continuing the game, it just abuptly ends in a vague cutscene. I had only just gotten a second arrow for my bow.  In the end, this game seemed like it was trying to be a lot of things and failing at all of them. It was made by what appears to be a primarily Chinese team, so this may be their first entry into American games, but it felt very lacking in ways that cannot simply be excused by considering other cultures. Get this game if it's on super sale. If for nothing else, the guy who voices Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: HR plays a guy in a wheelchair here. So, if you want to hear the moody gravel voice, this is the game for you.",

The characters are laughably simplistic with very little background ever established... which would really help given the main character seems to have the skillset of an Assassin from the Assassin's Creed franchise. I really would like to know how he's able to scale bridges and parkour on the level he does.  For a game about survival in a post-apocalyptic world there's very little actual survival and more on-rails walking engagement to engagement. You can't scavenge from the rubble, can't check inside containers or trash cans. This by itself hurts immersion.  What totally kills the immersion is the fact that even the fights are puzzles. You have to kill certain enemies in certain ways and in a certain order or you're dead before you know it. Stranger still is the ability to carry just one bullet for your magazine-fed handgun. There's no simple melee, no way to counter someone running up on you and no way to grapple someone less than a foot away from you with a firearm.  Even the animations are lazy. There's a scene wherein the main character is carrying a child on his back and ends up having to use his machete to break a chain. Our hero then sheaths this machete into the child's character model.  In conclusion? Boring, frustrating and not worth it. For a much better urban survival experience I'd reccomend the Fallout franchise.",

The climbing experience leaves something to be desired, mainly because of how repetetive it becomes when one runs out of stamina and supplies, but if you've already played the game through on Novice difficulty, you should know when to use supplies and when not to. All in all, this game definitely passes for the following genres:  -Post-apocalyptic -Survival -Exploration -Mood Altering Atmosphere  Thanks for reading.",

Gameplay is best described as a puzzler. You have to think before you act otherwise youll more than likely die. I don't really like that one mistake makes it 99.9% you'll die, but I guess that's a bit more realistic. Some moments seemed really challenging, and were almost too difficult at times, at least in terms of combat. Climbing aspect was fun and a good way to challenge your mind. However in terms of control, it could be unresponsive. trying to slide down a pole could cause you to move left or right several times instead, (which if you play you'll understand why it can be frustrating) and aiming, shooting, attacking could also freakout at times, but mostly aiming because of accidental switching between targets. Armored enemies were kind of OP because there were only two weak points, and because of tedious aiming capability made it hard to be accurate. Stealth was hardly even an optin because as soon any of the characters are in visual range they react, and most are placed in a way that makes it impossible. Player interaction with NPC's was limited to combat, or helping them out. the decision making was kimited to 'Do I have the item they need or not, and am I willing to spend the time to get it?' And finally the ending seemed abrupt, and was a cliffhanger that made no sense. However the characters were enjoyable. I'd say maybe 6 or 7/10",

            "review_text": "This game is nearly everything I wanted from a Post-apocalyptic game! It was still a whole lot different than I imagined, but in a good way. Unfortunately you can definitely tell that this game wanted to be more than it is, as it is missing some stuff which would have made this game even better; but I'll get back to that.   It's a good game that shows us that Zombies aren't the threat in a post-apocalyptic world (not that there are zombies in this game) but that people are threat. In this game you might hear someone crying for help, but it could just be a trap set in place so they can rob you of well you're life. So you have to beware of who you help and don't help. Also since items are very scarce, you have to ask yourself if you want to help this person giving him/her your last health pack or do you keep it for yourself. These are great questions but to my dismay the choices you make don't really impact the game.   If you for example help someone, they usually just say thank you and you get an extra retry. In fact the only reason to help someone in this game would be to get the achievement for helping all victims in the game. If however helping someone would impact the story line; for example the person you saved ends up helping you later in the game or perhaps you helped the wrong person, and that person later then screws you over in the story. Well I think you can imagine that would have made the choices in the game so much more interesting. Now theyre just NPCS that stare at you after you help them...well umm great.   So yeah theres a lot of potential for this game to be the best post-apocalyptic game ever but it unfortunately just misses the mark. I also feel like the fighting options are quite limited but maybe im just bad at the game. Either way I still found it a really enjoyabel game to play, and I do think I will replay the game again at some point just to save all the victims in the game. However the missed potential in this game stares at me with every NPC you save (they literally just stare at you). It's just such a shame no one has tried to improve on this concept because that would make the best post-apocalyptic game ever!!!  In conclusion, you should get this game! but feel free to wait for a steam sale. As long as you play 6 euros or less, it is worth it as you will definitely get 6 hours of gameplay; even from a rushed playthrough!",

Here's how the last encounter I had went when I finally nailed it after running low on the hard-to-come-by retries.   I walk into an area and am surrounded, 2 guys behind me and 3 in front. I quickly note that 2 of the guys are armored (one being behind me), the second man behind me has a gun, and the other 2 simply have knives. I also notice a bonfire in the corner. Then I make my plan and execute.  First I back up without revealing that I'm armed or willing to fight. However, the guy who approaches me is the armored guy who was behind me. Since he's armored, I can't kill him with a quick knife. So I continue backing up for a couple seconds until the only guy behind me is the one with a gun, and then I strike.  I attack the gunman with my surprise strike, killing off the gunner and leaving the 4 others in front of me without a way to get between me to the dead man's gun. I then have to immediately toggle to precision aim, and aim quickly to shoot the armored man who was harassing me before he slashes me and while the other 3 enemies approach.  Once I shoot the first armored man pointblank, I can quickly cycle between the 2 unarmored men and convince them to start backing up, realizing that I have a gun with ammo. The 2nd armored man continues approaching with his bulletproof vest, so I have to quickly switch to precision aiming and shoot him in the head.  At this point there are 2 men with knives left. I tell them both to keep backing up, separating them and forcing one to back up to the fire. I then kick the poor man into the fire to die, and quickly turn as the final man starts sprinting at me when he realizes I'm still looking to kill. I choose to save the 1 round of ammunition that I have left, and catch him in a one-on-one knife battle, knowing that I can finally win it without his buddies around to save him.   I walk away from 5 dead bodies with only 1 round of ammunition left, wondering how I can make it out of an even larger battle next time.   I highly recommend this game. It has its flaws, but it's easy to look past them with combat as thrilling and intense as this.",

If you play this, I recommend doing it on Easy so you doing spend eternity replaying chapters. It kind of being a sandbox (in that there are generally several ways to get to the same place) it does not allow for exploration very easily.  The main mechanics are completely derived from the PS2 game Disaster Report, which in my mind created this genre of Tomb Raider platformer + management of health + disaster scenario. Which is a good thing. It means you really need to plan your actions especially while climbing.   If you like climbing stuff and post apocalyptic environments, then it should be good.

The first guy you kill in the game wasn't necessarily an evil guy, just a guy who was scared and at the end of his rope. Everything just happens so fast (for me at least) and at the end, I thought, did I just kill a guy? Maybe its cause there is no tangible reward, but I didn't feel good about it.

And I was so hyped about this game also. :( I think it has lot of potential: post apocalyptic games always do, but the color world is awesome, the atmosphere is nice and the graphics are not bad.  But... everything else is. SPOILER ALERT!!! The first intro gives you a clue that you are not going to make it, so what´s the point even trying!? I mean come on! It´s a survival game! And yes a game where the main character dies can sometimes give it a little (or a lot) of that emotional richness that makes you remember the experience your whole life, but if your dead is not a suprise, it´s really just a bummer.  In my opinion, it´s also too limited a game. In a survival game you should be able to explore a little, be creative with your choises, but in this game it´s very stricht what route you can take and what choises to make.  I like the extra bit of nervousness when you start losing your stamina, but it´s also irritating when you´ll have the constant remainder of lost energy teasing you. I´d prefer if you didn´t need food etc. to gain the lost max. stamina, but enough rest would do the job and you could see the stamina-bar filling up. (And IF it´s already in the game, it´s not fast enough ´cause I waited for quite a long time to see, if the max. stamina would recover itself with time.)  I think if the game would get more of an open world -feel to it, (and btw, the controls are confusing as h*ll. I mean rmb for pointing gun AND dropping down rom a hight, space for climbing AND jumping, lmb pressing and tapping for running and runnin faster? Why do you need to run faster, when you can just run?), so less confusing controls, maybe a little editing on the intro and MORE CHOISES AVAILABLE IN EVERYTHING and I think this would make a wonderful game. but for now, I think I will not be playing it for a long while.",

I myself enjoy the graphic style a lot, aswell as the setting and how the game is narrated. The climbimg passages are hard and the timing and way to go isn't always obvious. The stamina system adds to the lost feeling and it's something new.  The fights are repetative, since it's always the same scheme, shoot the guys with guns, make the others surrender, if they don't shoot someone else, if they do, knock them out...  For 15€/U$/GBP you can't really do something wrong, picking it up. Playtime is 5 - 8 hrs from what i've read so far.",

I Am Alive is not as short as people make it out to be, but it isn't as long as a normal game (Think about if you took both Burial at Sea episodes and combined them, that's how long this game normally is). The gameplay mechanics are basic enough with a few gimicks (such as the bluff mechanic) and the AI is pretty solid. I also haven't run into any bugs like people are complaining about. All in all, don't listen to the majority of the people who say crap about this.  7.5/10",

It plays on the thought tht not many bullets are around, so it requires you to think about and plan each situation as good as you can. The only major problem, is the combat is incredibly clunky if you just run into it. That's why you need to plan everything out. And the situations when you stand off against three guys and you have one round in the chamber are tense as hell. At one point I'm pretty sure i actually yelled 'Okay, now get back!' at one point. Quite an immersive experience. It's got a system where you can help stranger in return for supplies (usually a respawn) and it is often not worth it, but it actually feels good to help sometimes. If you like Assasin's creed, The Last of Us, or just a fun post-apocalyptic setting, you'd probably enjoy this game. 7/10",

Probably because the gameplay on any difficulty other than easy is extremely tough. Limited retries, very few resources and you often end up in tight situations.  Not that it's not difficult on PC, but I personally found that a keyboard and mouse worked better for me. There's a lot that can be optimized in terms of controls but I know that's not gonna happen, so moving on.  The setting is really good. Atmospheric, good music, good voice actors, decent graphics with a really impressive post apocalyptic feel.  I'd recommend it to everyone just to experience the story. Play on easy difficulty and learn the story.",
