This game really makes you flustered with the new ideas but it is also done flawlessly. I love this game and can't wait to finish it for a 2nd time- Default Dan is also a great game for speedrunning- we already have 4 people at the top every time- refreshing to see :) 9/10 game (only because 10/10 aint real!)  Truly,   TwR ",

I didnt no when it was released and saw it on steam and I bought it without hesitation. I played a demo of this game last year and was amazed by how unique the gameplay is. It takes everything you know about classic mario games and makes forget everything you have learned. The graphics are not the greatest But they arent terrible. This is an Amazing game and I recommend it if you are tired of old fashion Platformers!!!! 9.8/10",
