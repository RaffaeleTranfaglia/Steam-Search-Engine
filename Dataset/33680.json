I mean it's not the creators fault that this is what actually is the lowest selling Lovecraft inspired game I mean LOOK at the main page, it says nothing of the horrors to come other than a glimmer! I want this to be a best selling it's great that more it's review status recently went from positive to very but I just don't feel that's enough for it.

            "review_text": "Eversion is a platformer that takes cues from some older, more recognised platformers — like Mario. It looks like a cute little retro game, where you play a small flower-like creature out to rescue a princess. You collect gems, stomp enemies, and reach the flag. However, in reality, it’s ”cute” and familiar only to deceive the player.  One unique feature — and the main idea of this game — is “eversion”. In specific, small, invisible “hotspots” in the game (that you can reach) you can switch to another sort-of parallel reality, where some rules might be different. For example, clouds can be walked on in some realities, and in others, shrubs become trees that block your path.  The game’s called “Eversion” for a reason: as you progress through the game, it starts “turning inside out”, revealing the hell inside this beautiful, peaceful world. You start off in a cute dreamy land, collecting gems and passing by (or stomping) happy, innocent “enemies” that skip around. Soon enough, these enemies turn worse and your surroundings change. At some point, the game even starts lying to the player and occasionally tries to discourage the player from continuing, while at the same time breaking the fourth wall.  Eversion is rather short (less than an hour, possibly more to max it out), but it’s a great experience that anyone should play. It challenges game design standards and does a lot of things completely different compared to standard games, even indie ones.",

            "review_text": "'The horror!'  A cheap little platformer, this might be one of the smallest games on Steam. I imagine anyone buying it just wanted it because it was cheap and looked cute.   How wrong you are.   Story Something about the princess being taken is written on the store page. You won't really see much story once in the game, except for the ending.   Presentation Cute graphics here, they are what drew me in to purchasing this game. Little did I know that would soon change to a nightmarish landscape rather quickly. While they are rather basic and obviously inspired by classic games, they still look nice.  The isn't a lot of music in the game, but it fits the setting. Simple sound effects that do the job as well. Not really much to say about them.   Controls As the controls are rather simple, they work well on keyboard, but gamepads also have support if you prefer those. Movement, jumping, the Eversion ability (which shall be detailed below) and a pause button. You could play this with a NES clone controller if you own one.   Gameplay Run, jump, bounce off enemy heads, collect the gems and reach the end of the level. Sounds like any NES era platformer game, right? Well, since the game opens up with a Lovecraft quote, there is obviously going to be something creepy lurking in the shadows. And that is where the Eversion ability comes in. In each level, there are locations where the walls between realities are weak. If you can find them, you can shift to another reality, often darker than the one you were already in. This will have an effect on both the landscape and enemies. That bush will wither and die, only to be replaced by deadly vines. Enemies may lose the will to live, just standing there for you to end its life, or it may get faster and more dangerous. Switching realities is needed to get all the gems through the levels, and sometimes even to progress forward through what would otherwise block movement.   Lifespan This game is short. Including the final level which requires you to find all the gems, you are unlikely to spend more than an hour or two doing the main game, including the different endings. Once you have seen the true ending, you do unlock a time attack mode with leader boards, which can add to the time spent on the game. There is also a level editor available, though I haven't played around with any of the community content myself.   While not a bad game, the short game length alone is a good enough reason to only get on sale or with a Steam discount coupon.  6 / 10",

            "review_text": "I'd like to do a Completionist-style review for this game. Because his reviews are awesome.  Foreword, Eversion is a quick Mario-style platformer and also a Lovecraftian game meaning the game starts out cute and bright, but as you progress through, it gets darker and darker. It also has achievements and trading card content to go with it! Eversion started out as a free online game, then implemented to Steam with HD graphics and new updated features.  THE STORY Zee Tee, the cute protagonist of the game, looking like an orange star-shaped creature with legs, has to go out in the land and save the princess Nehema. Zee Tee is able to 'Everse' to different layers of the world. Which get darker and scarier as he gets lower and lower in the layers. The other entities get dangerous and horrid as he gets lower. The game has three different endings based on what you do in the last few levels.  THE PRESENTATION The game begins in the top layer, where everything is bright, colorful, and cute, just like the first few levels of a Mario game! There are flowers and blue skies. Once you cross to the first eversion layer, which is right below the top one (Not the one you started at), the first layer shows a lower saturation of visuals, and you can see several things have slowly deteriorated. In fact, if you get down into lower eversion layers, they deteriorate even more and the other creatures get more monstrous. Also blood. It's a rather disturbing game. That's why you should acknowledge the fine print at the start of the game: 'not intended for children or those of a nervous disposition'.  THE GAMEPLAY The game has seven levels before the main ending. Each level is short and quick. Use the arrow keys to control your character, and press the Space bar to locate Eversion portals and flip through layers when at one. However in deeper layers, you won't be able to locate them, but you'll know when you're at them when the background partially changes. There are also gems in each level to collect and they are required for a secret eighth level and secret ending for 100%. The best part about the gems is they are ALL persistant meaning they remain collected when you die or quit the level. No need having to collect them again! Of course flipping through eversion layers is crucial for going through most levels and collecting gems. There is also a Time Attack mode after the secret ending and you can run through any level in the shortest about of time. It has worldwide leaderboards. I'm working on some good times now. I'm top 40 in the first level, but that's only the first level. Finally, the game has controller support, so grab your Xbox 360 controller if you have one!  THE FINAL LEVEL (SPOILERS!) I'll actually talk about not only the seventh level but the secret eighth level also. The seventh level is one of the few that goes through ALL the layers. You start at a deep layer where the background is red with demonic hands in the background, and no music. Collecting all the gems is tricky work as you have to go back and fourth through the level to find the eversion portals. You don't need to shift to any layer to beat the level, but when you do. You see the ending with the princess becoming a MONSTER. Game over, then the game crashes. So if you want a better ending, you must beat the secret level. At the start of the seventh level, there is a gem count. If you get ALL the gems in the game, you're able to shift to the FINAL layer where it's the DARKEST ever, with enemies regenerating over time. Beating the level with the final layer takes you to the eighth, which is the same deal, except you need to solve puzzles, locate portals, and get to the end to get the good ending. It's similar to the endless castles in SMB. You start at the lowest layer, and work your way up to the top layer to the end of the level. Then the secret ending, it was much more screwed up, as not only has the princess became a monster again, but ZEE TEE as well. WHAT A TWIST.  So that was Eversion. It's a quick game that turns cute to HORRIFYING quick. It can really unsettle you if you're not prepared. Yesterday I started playing this game, beaten the game, got all gems, got the secret ending, and got ALL achievements. It's THAT quick. However it's $5 for a game you could play for free, but you have extra features. I suggest buying it when it's on sale. Like I did! To conclude, Eversion is a fun game with a really interesting gameplay mechanic. I find it have a nice replay value with the graphics and everything. If you're not like me, it's a game to mess around with for a short time until you go tired of it, or a game you can play to waste time on. I recommend this game. Awesome concept.",

            "review_text": "Eversion is a simple, basic 2D side scrolling platformer. The only twist being that you have the ability to shift environments (eversions). You can shift from six different eversions: deception, erosion, desolation, apprehension, confusion and commotion. Every shift will change colors and backgrounds. The shifts will also turn bushes from leafy, to dead so you can pass through them and into deadly thorn bushes. Some enemies into stone and brick platforms into crumbling blocks. You cannot just shift on a whim, you need to find the invisible area you're supposed to stand in and then shift eversions. When you press the eversion button, if you're close enough to the correct invisible spot, you'll see a ring around it for a brief time. If you're stuck, that usually means you need to backtrack and find the invisible spot.  The gameplay is simple. Like Mario you can destroy bricks by jumping into them and make a gem appear out of blocks by jumping into special ones. Eventually, you will get to see this magical kingdom for what it is. Horrifying, dark and grim. At some point, enemies will spurt bright red blood partially obscuring the screen. Although some might boast this as a horror game, there's nothing really horrific. I was too busy laughing at the giant hands that comically shoot up from death pits. Its too bright and simple of an art style to really be horrific.  There are no power ups. Every hit is instant death, but that's okay because there are no lives. You just respawn at the start of the level or the last checkpoint. The game boasts 8 worlds, but really these worlds are just 8 levels. A world to me feels like it should be more than a level. I was able to breeze through the game in half an hour and that's even looking for invisible eversion points. At the end of each level you hop on a ground flag. There are no bosses, in fact there really only seems to be three enemy types in the game. Monkey claw, goomba and some sort of stone beetle.  Upon completing the game, it just crashed back to the desktop. The only replay value is going back to collect all 240 gems to get better endings that reference better properties. Once you get a gem, it the game considers collected, even if you die on the same run, that gem will not be there. Not having any consequence of death makes things way too easy.

Eversion is at its core a puzzle platformer, and a clever one too. You control the flower-faced hero named Zee Tee and rescue the princess, so if you've played any NES game before you already know what to do.  Gameplay is basically platforming but with a dimension-warping mechanic where you jump through alternate worlds. You may have to change something in one world in order to affect the other world and then you can get to where you couldn't before. It sounds hard at first but with a bit of practice you will eventually understand what to do. There are collectables throughout the stages to give some replay value, though I wasn't too interested. Things do get shaken up later with different enemies and slightly different ways to play the stage, though generally things remains the same throughout. Of course, the other dimensions might just maybe chinge things up a bit. I will warn you, it will get stressful.  All I can say is don't watch videos of it or look up other reviews because the main thing here which I didn't discuss will be totally spoiled. Simply play Eversion and experience it for yourself.",

This game features 240 gems, or 'Glitters', scattered around the game's 8 levels. The game boasts the amazing ability to 'evert', or warp between different versions of a level. Each of the worlds use vivid colors, so the game is not overly dark, meaning it could be played well at night. The game boasts a lovely chiptune soundtrack that's best shared alone (why let mere mortals listen to its greatness?). As for playing with friends, Eversion also has a great time attack mode that adds a lot of replay ability. On top of that, there's hidden items to collect in each level, making this a game you'll play a lot, whether you want to or not. Eversion is a wonderfully happy game everyone* should play.  *Not intended for children or those of a nervous disposition.",

            "review_text": " Quick Breakdown:  A short platformer that centers itself around using what it calls “eversion,” which changes the state of the world.  Length:  30-60 minutes  Genre:  Platformer  Score:  5/10   Full Review:   Eversion  is a fairly simple platformer, you walk left and right, jump across platforms, jump on enemies heads to dispose of them, and collect gems; pretty typical platformer fair. The gimmick for this game is the ability to “evert,” which can only be done at certain points of a level. Everting is activated simply by clicking the key assigned to do so at an evert point. When you evert you change the world around you to an alternate reality. There are 7 different realities in use (plus an 8th hidden one), though most levels only use a small number.  You need to find eversion points to change the world so that you can progress though out the stage, as it will change small things about the world that let you progress. It’s not rocket science figuring out how to use eversion to advance, as it’s all pretty straight forward.  When you begin the game the world starts out very happy and cheery, bright colours and all that. As you descend into the later stages of eversion, the world gradually shifts darker and darker.  The gameplay itself isn’t really anything fancy. In the early levels you’ll notice it draws influence from the original  Super Mario Bros.  This is most notable in the first stage, as it bears a striking resemblance in how the beginning of the level looks.  The gems scattered throughout the game for you to collect don’t serve any purpose, except to unlock a secret level at the end of the game. I didn’t take the time to unlock the secret level, and after pulling it up on youtube to have a look at it, I don’t plan to either, as it doesn’t look like it’s worth the time.  So is it worth buying? Eh, only if you want a short little platformer to kill an hour (if that). There’s a free version available on the developer’s (Zaratustra Productions), though the Steam version features some minor graphical and audio updates. It’s normally $5, though it’s really not worth that price, so I’d wait for it to go on sale. I wish I could give this game a neutral rating, as it’s not good enough to really recommend, nor is it bad enough to advise against purchasing. Take your pick based on if it looks interesting to you or not.",

In order to get the 'good' ending, you'll have to collect all 240 gems which requires mastery of the eversion button in order to bypass the obstacles.
