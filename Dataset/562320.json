            "review_text": "Locked in VR is an incredible and unique escape room with a style that makes it stand out among others of it's kind.  The game has you waking up in a run-down basement, full of garbage, junk, and your typical corpse hanging from the ceiling. From there you receive a phone call saying you have a limited amount of time to find your way out. You look at the wall in front of you with a timer that is slowly counting down from 1 hour. Now it's a race against the clock with your own life on the line.   The atmosphere is top notch. You truly feel like you're in the disgusting basement of a serial killer. There's dim lighting, blood on the floor, that dead body hanging above you, etc. You really do get a sense that a deranged murder has commiting all sorts of disgusting and horrible acts in there. The one issue with the graphics is that they are fuzzy... as if you need glasses. It does not look as sharp and clear as in the trailer. Even with supersampling enabled, it's not good and takes away from the otherwise impressive surroundings.  If you're looking for a challenge then you have one. I was not able to get out of the room in time and met a horrible death. But one thing that maybe made this happen was a certain part of the game is bugged.  *POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*  In the game you have to find slides to place inside of a projector. Some of the slides are worthless while some of them provide valuable information to help you escape. When I was playing there were three slides that just would not go in the projector, while all the rest of the slides went in with no problem. It's quite frustrating when you're towards the very end and cannot progress any further because of a bug like this. I'm curious to know if anyone else came across this issue. *END OF SPOILERS*   I also had some minor issues when it came to grabbing things, which wasn't game breaking but was annoying every now and then. And the other minor issue is the voice acting of your character; He sounds like a Russian Nathan from South Park (google him if you want to know what I mean). I hope there comes an option to disable the narration.  Despite the fuzzy graphics, the projector bug, and the poor voice acting, the game is very much worth the $6. I trust that the projector issus will be fixed if the dev ends up reading this review and hopefully something can be done about the fuzzy graphics.  TL;DR Locked in VR has a mentally disturbing and horrific atmosphere with engaging puzzles and is one of the best escape rooms for VR to date.",
