(so if you like to grind its good)  -Combat is Broken a bit Auto-Fight will not work right in later levels even if your Attack/Def is higher than your attacker.  -Graphics Fastest Vs. Best there is no diferance. (very minor)   -The game works VS you as you level. Making it a Grind to not lose every battle and all of your ants slowly.   -Graphics can be noticed that the further you go the worse they get, Game was finished in a lazy end,  -only the ant graphics are the best in the game.  -seemed like he did not put much time at the end of the game  This is best recomended for your kid. Its a mindless/ easy game nothing hard about it. Better off as a moble or a app game.",

            "review_text": "So I'll get this out of the way, I myself love this game, but that is STRICTLY because I played it when I was like 7 years old. I would never recommend this game to anyone though. It's fraught with flaws.  First of all, the UI is extremely odd, and can be very confusing to navigate. The whole game is a clicking simulator, which isn't bad for some, as games of the like are usually great ways to pass the time, which is one redeeming factor the game has. The art. HOOOOOLY CRAP the art. The whole game is literally clip art images that you can easily find on google, some of which have been animated very simply (we're talking a few pivot points on some images in like, Adobe AfterEffects). The music and sound effects are maddingly repetitive, as well as the 'battle' sequences which are just some more clicking (if you win you get some stuff if not oh well).  Essentially, this game is horrendous, if you buy it, use it to waste time and only to do so. If you have some nostalgia to deal with like I did, go right ahead, I love this game sure, but that doesn't make it good. Sort of like loving a terrible, terrible, movie.  TL;DR: I played this game as a kid and loved it, still love it, but it's still terrible.",

It has an exciting, well-paced story mode campeign, followed with a mutliplayer that I enjoyed playing. It has so many matches going on that there's literally an endless amount of gameplay. Also, the potential content and the price ratio is absolutely unbelievable. Definitely worth buying. I know I'm usually really critical, with no game reaching more than 7/10, but this game is so perfect that it's a definite...    10/10.",

This game really wouldnt be fun to sit there and play for long but it is cool to see the gradual build up of your ants over the course of many weeks or months im pretty sure this is an old flash game i used to play for free but its nice to be able to save my progress and in the skeem of things it will be worth the 1.79 i payed for it as i belive as long as you get 1 hour of gameplay for 10 cents spent it was an amazing buy",
