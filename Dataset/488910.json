    "description": "Astral Heroes is a Collectible Card Game that's simple to learn, exciting to play, and deep enough to challenge even the greatest strategists. It's the spiritual sequel to our older game, Astral Masters, which still enjoys a loyal following over ten years after its release!",

            "review_text": "A worthy successor to Astral Masters. Some rules have been simplified and it's faster paced, but still the same idea. Build a deck out of your cards and battle opponents in the league, or with random decks or draft tournaments. The cards come a bit faster if you pay, but it's absolutely not necessary.  Skill counts for a bit more than in some games, but it's not chess and the decisions on each turn won't take forver to think about. The basic rules are simple, and each card's special properties and abilities are clearly described on it. Cards are divided into creatures and spells - creatures all have a special ability as well as attack and defence. There are few options to hit the opponent directly, so although spells are powerful and creatures don't tend to live very long, the creature battle is nevertheless central.  There is a single-player campaign with daily missions, including a good few at the start to get you familiar, but I think it's fair to say that multiplayer is the core of the game. Multiplayer is painless - click on 'Play League Game' and in a few seconds you'll get an opponent in the range of 0.5-2 times your current level, or failing that a bot will arrive to take you on. So getting a game is also fast.   Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy this type of game,",

            "review_text": "A very nice change of pace for online tcgs.  The whole game feels just more fun and less stressful than other games mainly due to the soft graphics and sound. However even just the way the game plays feels simple but with lots of strategy.  So far it feels balanced to me as well, I think the only negitive is how slow it is to get new cards but since every card seems decent it always feels rewarding when you get a new card. You can never get more than 3 of a card (the max you can put in a deck) so the chance to get all the cards eventually is decent. ",

            "review_text": "Pros  Has a good resource system Cool loking cards Multi class decks Mostly balanced cards MTG level written of text on cards (which you don't really need to do, you could just be sloppy like Hearthstone but this works) The cards work together perfectly Cons You don't know if you clicked on a card with nothing really telling you besides a barely visable image diffcultly curve is wobly Some matches are so diffcult you have to hope the AI makes a mistake Not really a good page layout system  Why I don't reccomend this is because you have hearthstone you could play and it feels more compettive, this feels like its trying to tell a story with bits and pieces of bread crums. The problem is the gameplay has symetary which it is its weakness rather than its strength its advertising. Games are boring when they are balance and its annoying when you have a card that rocks the boat when introduced.",
