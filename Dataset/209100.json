The problem is that this game insists upon being Gears Of War 90% of the time. I don't play Resident Evil to duck behind cover and get into gun fights with random soldiers. When I want to do that, I'll play Call Of Duty or Gears Of War. When I play Resident Evil, it's because I want to shoot zombies and the like. This game would be really awesome if there was an option to remove the random gun toting soldiers. They bring nothing good to the gameplay. It's not fun. It's not cool. They're just annoying and force you to play the game in a way that makes it feel nothing like Resident Evil or Left 4 Dead.  When you're just running and gunning and mowing down zombies, the game is quite enjoyable. But those moments are rare since the game insists upon throwing soldiers at you every other minute.  I can't even bring myself to finish the game. If the encounters with soldiers were a very rare thing, I could get over that. But the fact that they are a constant part of the game is really really really killing the buzz.",

Did I also mention this game is STILL running on GFWL? That's right, that means there's no way to save your progress now. Considering that makes the game even more unplayable than it was before, PC players honestly should be refunded for the price they purchased this game and its DLC for.",

I played all of the single player maps (including the DLC maps), and I must say; this game is very different from other Resident Evil titles - it is overwhelmingly and predominately a shooter game! Unfortunately, there were several in game negatives to contend with as well. First of all, it seemed as though the weapons were entirely too 'nurfed' - most of the time, it was necessary to shoot the enemies multiple times. Also, the 'tag-a-long' AI controlled comrades, were frequently in the way or under foot. With that said, I nevertheless did enjoy this game. If you like a challenging third person shooter, then this game is for you.",

The city looks beautiful in full 1080p as you are fighting for your life. You have all your standard Resident Evil universe enimies along with a few new for this time period. Character models are a bit off, story is mostly not canon and voice acting is average at best. Not like your traditional Resident Evil this is all about shooting up everything that you can and each character has different perks wich gives it a new twist. Game is all about co-op through campaign and multiplayer. Experience can be underwhelming if you go it alone. For the soundtrack you have some remastered resident evil tracks along with some new ones. If you have an itch for a unique 3rd person shooter with teamwork or want to take one last haul in to Raccoon city I suggest you give this games a try!  Console Score 6.75/10  Final Score: 8.0/10",

Admittedly I also enjoyed the heck out of Aliens: Colonial Marines (which I got for 80% off) and played that campaign with friends to completion.  I really enjoyed the Wolfpack characters and their campaign. I played it on easy and had a blast. It's Co-Op so friends can join to make it even more fun. I've only started the other campaign and assume it will be just as good (though the characters are dumb &amp; nowhere near as cool as the Wolfpack) p.s.

After fixing the inevitable GWFL crash, deleting settings.dat, setting compatibility mode to Win7, disabling high-DPI scaling and visual effects in the properties menu, setting the affinity to use only three cores, running contig.exe in the ORC folder, increasing memory.ini thresholds, setting priority to 'above normal' and 'high', lowering the graphical settings to absolute minimum including setting my resolution to a painful 640x360, applying further optimizations through nVidia Control Panel, even after many restarts/settings.dat deletions, my GeForce 730 stutters with this game so terribly that I can't even play it. No game has ever given me this much trouble, I'm normally able to get ANY game to run at about 60FPS using some of the above methods, even Splinter Cell: Double Agent and GTA4.  This is the worst port I have ever FN SEEN, and I've been able to work with some of the worst of the worst, but not this.  It seems like a five-year-old took the native 360 version of this game, made it run on PC a little, and built the final product. To reinforce the notion of sheer laziness of Capcom's [not Microsoft's] job on this port, the 360 HUD is still there, with the differences being that keys replace the face buttons, but the visual 360 D-Pad is still there in the left corner of the screen.  This is a horrible mess, and Capcom has hardly lifted a finger to solve any of the problems with it, and they haven't even glanced in its direction since 2013.  That means 'you're not getting any updates or support for this game in the future, you crummy end-user marks.'  ",

The story is different and played from the perspective of Wolfpack which is a spec-ops unit under Umbrella Corporation which is great because you always play as the main characters which fall outside of the Umbrella Corporation. This really does give a different perspective to the Resident Evil sotry as a whole which I enjoyed.   Relating to the gameplay issues people are having:  - There was not one single game crash when I launched the game or during playing the game through. - There are no bugs during the game either, everything runs smoothly.   The game overall was exciting as you can upgrade your character and unlock new weapons, abalities etc... During the actual missions there is a lot to do in terms of finding collecatables etc which for me extended the gameplay time as well.   Making a quick point on the DLC content, I had NO ISSUES!!!! I bought the DLC add-on and the extra ECHO SIX missions were there, all new added costumes and weapons as well.   In conclusion and not to give too much away story wise, I would recommend this game with a double thumbs up to any Resident Evil fan out there!",

Meanwhile, my friend who gifted me this game has yet to even get play the game because he gets an issue where he just keeps having a black screen. This game either needs to get rid of 'Games for Windows Live', go Free To Play, or just be deleted off Steam. If someone says to you that its worth it for Singleplayer, or anything along the lines of: 'Oh this game is alright.'.

Do I think you should buy it? No. Not even if it's on sale, disgusting game. I was looking forward to this and so eager to buy it!..only to find out that it was a waste of my money. RE failed after Resident Evil 5, 6 was good but not that great.  If you want a good RE game on Steam, go for the remastered edition of RE or RE4, RE5 or lastly Resident Evil: Revelations, a game that was ported from the 3DS with better and scarier gameplay than this wannabe tactical SWAT game, regardless of single/coop play.",

The gameplay itself is pretty fun and if you have friends that you can play with it wil be great if you can manage to get this game on sale with the spec ops missions then go for it. The multiplayer is in my opinion the best part of this game with fun game types and then the addition of having zombies running around is great fun and really makes things alot more tense. The game its self when played by your self can be challaging which is nice since most shooters you can breeze throuh. Unfortuantly thats about it I can say about why I like this game  Now for the cons. The story is weak. The really could have got alot more out of it and the ending is just awful with it just cutting to credits from a weak â¥â¥â¥ end cutscene on top of all that you have to pay for the spec ops missions which should have been included on disk and not some sort of dlc cash in that Capcom are notorious for. Also the campaign is super short clocking in at maybe 3 hours long. Unfortunatly the online multiplayer seems dead (now i only tried queing once but never got a game). Which really sucks cause thats like half this game.  Slant Six has some great ideas but the just dont quiet excute them right. I did really enjoy this game on release (Xbox360) but the lack of people playing online really has me questioning if i should recommend this game.Personally I really enjoyed this game and didnt realise all the flak it got on the time of release but since im writing this review now and not then Im going to have to say I do not recommend getting this game (unless you get it on sale price like I did)",

            "review_text": "Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City is a gaiden game for the Resident Evil series. It's skirts on the 'recommend' side of 'recommend or not', but only barely. There's quite a few flaws in the game, but it's overall not a bad game.  A bit of background. You play as one of Delta Squad, an elite fireteam in the Umbrella Security Service. From there you take on increasingly harder missions assisting Umbrella in eliminating evidence of their involvement of Raccon City's outbreak and their 'morally questionable' practices.   Now this is NOT a bad game. However, if you walk into this game expecting a 'Resident Evil' (i.e. survival horror with zombies) game, you WILL be disappointed. If you do not treat this game as a 'Resident Evil' game, you will enjoy it significantly more.   The good points,  It runs on a class system, where there are six classes to pick from (Recon / Demolition / Assault / Sniper / Medic / Scientist), where each class has their own uses and skill sets. Only one of each class can be in the run at any given time, so your team will ALWAYS be missing something. This, in my opinion, is actually good, but can shoo away some people. For example, at some points you run into armed mines. Demolitions are the only 'safe' way of effectively dealing with them, but if you don't have a Demolitions, you could be slowed down severely by those mines. If your team is lacking a medic, you will ALWAYS be missing something important. Optimally, you'd set up a fairly balanced team to go into these missions.  The gameplay is fun. It's not 'Holy crap, you have to play this game' fun, but it's fun. It's a passtime and enjoyable enough to play. There are some flaws in the gameplay, but that will be covered in the next section.  Now for the bad points.  It runs on Windows Live for some reason, so you'll need to get an account there to play the game online at all. It's especially redundant because looking at the grey / black background of this review window should give you the impression you're already on Steam. So why would we need Windows Live? I admit, this is incredibly minor. It's still a minor gripe, nonetheless.  The AI in general. The AI enemies seem to be programmed as zombies. As a result, most of the enemies will come after human players. AI allies are also really, really, really, REALLY dumb. As a result, I recommend you play this game with AT LEAST 3 people. If you can find 2 other people to play this game with (that can, of course, agree on who will play what role), it'll be a much better experience.  The cover system. It's terrible and needs a lot. The game is moderately schizophrenic on what qualifies as 'cover' and what doesn't. Some 'cover' doesn't protect you entirely and it can be a big hassle in the middle of a firefight. This somewhat ties into having more than just one player.  Overall  In spite of the more 'bad points' than 'good points', one of the bad points is almost completely negated by having friends you can play with and another is more of a minor inconvenience. If you want to play this game, I would recommend that you wait for a sale and make sure you have a few friends you can play this game with. Even with all the DLC, this game is NOT worth the $40 price tag.  TL;DR - Play with friends, wait for sale. Not a bad game.",

The Team play is awesome not only you can do single player but you can also do multi player and hang with your friends and kill zombies together! The game is alot of fun and if you play Resident Evil and you want to know what happened during RE 2 and Nemesis? This is the game you want to get to learn what goes on.   The level up system is awesome throughout the game you can see who is stronger but there's also a character selection you can choose any of the 6 members of wolfpack. Vector, Lupa, Beltway, Bertha, Spectre and Four Eyes you can pick the skills you want to get and the weapons you want to use.  So I would recommend this game to any player who loves RE and who like team play",
