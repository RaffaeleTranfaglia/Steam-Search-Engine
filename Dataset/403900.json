            "review_text": "Yet another lazy mobile port. Resolution is locked at 1280 x 768. There are no rebindable keys, which if you are left handed like me, makes the game pretty much unplayable past the first few levels. Plus the game suffers from some of the worst screen tearing issues I have seen in a non-idtech game. You'd be much better off just playing this on mobile since no effort was made to make the port PC friendly.",

Forcing window mode crashes it. Forcing scren resolution crashes it. There are no options to blindly fumble through to change it to get it to work. Black Screen Simulator the game. Didn't even bother with cards. Refund requested.",
