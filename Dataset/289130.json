            "review_text": "I looked through a lot of reviews before writing this and I find myself in a quandry. I can understand both the positive and negative reviews I read, they are mostly coherent and true. I have played most of the 4x games(historical, fantasy and sci-fi) that have ever been published so I think I can reasonably say I am speaking from experience.   Positives I have played over 1400 hours including all the expansions. With that said I obviously like the game and I don't think I have anything new to say that you can't already read in other reviews.  Negatives There are still some things that bug me about the game even after several expansions and updates and I think they deserve mentioning. I have noticed that people that like this game are almost defensive about it and refuse to admit it's weaknesses.  Documentation, rules, tutorials - These are all pretty bad especially for a game that many people would find complex. I really enjoy games with depth to them, that is not what I am talking about. Even after 1400 hours their are technical elements of the game I do not understand and rules I am surprised by. That shouldn't happen (especially with an experienced gamer). Much of the useful documentation has been published by players. I find it frustrating to dig through home made guides that may or may not answer my questions. The discussion group can be equally opaque. Hoping you can guess the right key word that will take you to a comment applicable to your issue is equally frustrating. Just as a prime example, the game has several races you can play. There was 1 race in particular that I just wasn't understanding fully despite a variety of searches. At one point someone suggested a tutorial on YouTube. I clicked the link, it was just under an hour long!? And, no I did not even try to watch it.  Combat - In a way this goes with my previous comment. Despite my research I still don't think I fully understand the manual combat. You give your units some generalized commands(order matters) and hope they do what you asked of them. Some of the behavior the units perform is thoroughly bewildering, i.e. you tell a unit to 'Defend' and it charges forward? Regardless, it is a long game and between that and the peculiarities of combat I simply use autocombat barring some unusual circumstances. Personally I enjoy empire building over tactics, but that is just a matter of taste.  Bugs - despite how long it's been out there are still several bugs. Are they game stoppers, generally no, that doesn't mean that I enjoy them. The developers have offered many updates and you are welcome to post bugs on their site as long as you have a save file to go with it. Not all bugs can be demonstrated with a save file.  In the end, do I recommend the game, absolutely, but it has it's flaws.",

The game pace is somewhat slower but the quality of the game and the story lines built in to the game make it worth playing over and over,   For gameplay and asthetics I prefer Endless Legends over the new Civ BE which I also have. Both are great games but BE is really another Civ with some nice new features and additions where Endless Legends is a new game with a complimentary story line that takes place in the pre Endless Legends universe.  If you buy it you will not be sorry. As a new game there are still some tech glitches and AI issues to be worked on but I have played for well over a month with no errors or crashes so it is well on the way to be another classic.",

            "review_text": "  TL;DR   - 9/10, worth buying at full price if you like deep strategy games. Would be a strong 10/10 if endgame were successfully rebalanced.  Endless Legend is a deep, complex 4x game with a great selection of unique factions and a ton of strategy. Of the many 4x games I've played, this is the only one that holds up to the Civ series, and actually exceeds it in many respects. Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves strategy. It is fun and extremely addicting.  The game has a long learning curve - hundreds of hours in, I'm still improving. I absolutely love this about the game, though some may find it overwhelming. Every turn presents choices, and every choice feels important. Mistakes are punished harshly, and can make or break your early game. To play well, you must pay close attention to every detail. You must be aggressive but careful at the same time, and most of all, you must be thorough.  Manual combat is very difficult, and can be frustrating. Checking each unit's initiative and minding the terrain are essential. Even then, things will not go as planned. That being said, I don't see this as a weakness - just a challenge. Keep in mind, most 4x games do not feature anything close to this. And if you don't like it, you can just use auto-combat (which works quite well).    THE PROBLEM    Once you learn the ins and outs, you realize that Endless Legend has one major weakness: Endgame. The problem is with pacing, scaling, AI, and the lack of an effective 'limiter'.  The pace of the game accelarates as certain empires start to dominate the map, and the numbers get out of control. The victory conditions are reached too quickly, and feel anticlimactic. By the time you reach the final tier of technologies and get the best gear, the game is pretty much over and you don't get to use any of it. This is extremely disappointing after a very long game of building up to that point.  Additionally, the AI does not function well in endgame. They don't upgrade their equipment all the way, and you can crush them easily in every fight. Even on higher difficulty settings, they just pump out lots of weak armies.  Basically, endgame needs a serious rebalancing, and it needs something that slows the game down (especially victory conditions) and limits the exponential growth of empires. Approval rating (the equivalent to happiness in Civ) should be the limiting factor, but it is too easily overcome.  If the devs pulled off a serious endgame overhaul, I can say confidently that Endless Legend would be the greatest 4x game ever made. As it stands today, it's still a great game, but the disappointing endgame is a real buzz-kill.",

            "review_text": "Endless Legend is Amplitudes second 4X game. This time it's fantasy instead of space, but it still has the 'Amplitude Spirit'. By that I mean that the game looks neat, isn't too heavy on your rig, has a clean and easily accessible interface but does stuff differently than you probably would expect. While Endless Space was relatively true to the 4X space standards, Dungeon of the Endless deviated from the typical rogue-like noticeably, and now, with Endless Legend they take it even a little bit further.    Overview   At first glance Endless Legend looks like your typical hex based fantasy 4X; or it looks like it will turn into one once it is finished. You start the game with a small army on a randomly generated map and the ability to found a city. As with most other fantasy 4X games where you build your first city is important. Each city generates resources based on the hex it is build on and the 6 hexes surrounding it, which resources you want depends on the faction you play. From there on you start to explore the map with your starting army, looking for ruins to loot, roaming mobs to fight and villages to burn until you meant your first AI faction and start the typical dance of diplomacy and war.  There are also heroes in Endless Legend which can either be assigned to a city or an army. Either way they gain experience and offer boni based on their skills. An army accompanied by a hero is much stronger than one without and a city with the right hero can be pretty effective.   Like most new 4X fantasy games Endless Legend has quests, but it does it a little bit differently. Quest are not just simple 'fetch x kill y' missions, they also tell a story - at least the main quest which is different for each faction - and don't just give items or dust as a reward but can also give you access to technologies you can't get otherwise. So, searching ruins for quests is something you really want to do.     Regions, Cities and Empire Management   Once you start exploring the map you instantly notice that there is something different: The map is divided into regions. Regions come in different sizes and shapes but they always have a least one minor faction village and some special resources, which you can only harvest if you have a city in that region. But the most important thing about them is that there can always only be one city in each region. This doesn't only mean that whoever has a city in a region basically controls it, it also makes you really think about where you want to build your city.  Over the course of the game cities can expand. You can build boroughs in hexes adjacent to a city centre or other boroughs and thereby gain access to resources that previously where out of reach.     Combat System   Endless Legend utilizes a turn based tactical combat system but doesn't give you full control over your units. At first, it is kinda weird but it has its charm and give the game a unique touch. Each battle starts with a deployment phase where you can place your units. After that you have multiple order and action phases. During the order phase you give you units orders which they than try to fulfil during the action phase. If they can't fulfil their order, e.g. cos the tile you want the to move to is already occupied by another unit or the unit you want them is already dead or out of reach, the AI will take over and let the unit do what it thinks is best.   Another neat thing about tactical battle is that they take place on the strategic map. When two opposing armies meet a battlefield is staked out around them which means that the area where you fight actually matters. This is especially true since elevation actually matters in Endless Legend and stuff like cliffs can block your movement paths.  You should think twice before you move an army next to a cliff where you opponent could attack them from above but they have no chance of reaching them.    Customization   Endless Legend doesn't allow you to fully customize your units and heroes but you can give them equipment such as weapons, shields, armour and trinkets. In addition to items heroes have a skill tree that consist of 3 different line that are connected to each other. Which skills a hero has access to depends on its type (infantry, ranged, cavalry or flyer) and the faction you play.  Each faction only has 3 units that will always do specific things and look a certain way. Equipment won't affect their appearance much nor will it allow you to change a units role. However, there are also quite a few minor faction units which you can recruit once you assimilated a village of their faction. This allows you to add troops to your army your faction otherwise wouldn't have access to.     Influence and Diplomacy   When it comes to diplomacy, which is also not fully implemented yet, Amplitude goes for a strange new but nonetheless interesting concept. They have a resource called influence which is needed for every diplomatic act, may it be offering peace, declaring war or assimilating a minor faction.   Every 20 turns you can also use influence to change your Empire Plan, which gives you different buffs based on what you pick. A neat little idea that helps you to adapt your global strategy a little bit.    Major Factions  There are 8 major factions in Endless Legend, some of them are pretty standard fantasy stuff others are rather unique and offer you a different approach to the game.  The Vaulters are you typical science guys with a dwarfish love for crossbows.  The Wild Walkers are wood elves that left the woods to start a civilisation, they are you builders.  The Broken Lords are basically Dust vampires that have to purchase population. The Necrophases are warmongering insects that can't be at peace, ever. The Arden Mages are masochistic mages that grow stronger the more you hurt them. The Roving Clans are nomad traders that can't deny you access to the market place. The Drakken try to play world police, they like diplomacy and can force treaties. The Cultists only have one city but can convert pacified minor faction villages.    Minor Factions  Each region in Endless Legend has 1-3 villages of a minor faction in it. Unless pacified, which can either be done by bribing the, attacking the village or doing a quest, these villages will grow and spawn armies that will roam the map and cause havoc.   Once you have a city in a region with a pacified minor faction you can assimilate that minor faction which will add population to your city, give you some small bonuses and allow you to recruit a special unit.    Winter is coming   There are two seasons in Endless Legend: Summer and winter. In summer everything is fine, your people are happy, your cities produce resources and your units can actually move. During winter however things are different. Suddenly you produce less food and dust, your people might get a little grumpy and your units can't move as far any more.  When winter is coming and how long it lasts is somewhat random. You know vaguely when to expect it, but you can't really be sure. And the longer you play the harsher the winter.   This adds another interesting layer to the game. While Endless Legend plays like a typical 4X during summer, winter changes the rules. Suddenly it becomes a survival game, if you haven't stockpiled enough food your people might starve and if you are low on dust your might have to destroy city improvements or disband armies cos you no longer can afford them.  Warfare is also quit different during winter. Units need way more time to reach their destinations, so it's probably not a good idea to send all your armies searching ruins when winter is coming.    Multiplayer  Well, Endless Legend has multiplayer. That's pretty much all I can say about it cos I never tried it. In my book, 4X games are meant to be played solo, on your own clock.",

            "review_text": "Endless Legend (EL) is a very ambitious simultaneously turn based new 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) strategy game in a fantasy setting by Amplitude studios (Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless). The general setting is unusual, as you're stranded on the planet Auriga that has been a favoured laboratory of a powerful precursor race, the Endless, until they erased themselves from existence in a large civil war. Now, you take control of one out of 8 standard factions or any custom faction you create in an editor, using the basic gameplay of one of the 8 with some modifiers. Your goal is to survive as Auriga is slowly drifting towards an everlasting winter that will snuff out all life left on its surface. There are several victory conditions you can fulfill, ranging from 'bucket'-type conditions like gathering enough currency or being the highest in score at a configurable turn limit to fulfilling a quest and building an expensive wonder, exterminating all concurrents or researching yourself to victory. Not all of these victory conditions are equally fun to reach as 'filling a bucket' can be quite tedious, but the different factions are also specialised at reaching different victory conditions. And this is where EL is ambitious in the sense that its 8 factions are very asymmetrically designed: - The Wild Walkers are the not so usual Elves of the game, using woods to boost their industrial proficiency. They get to be the production powerhouse of the game. - The Vaulters are the survivors of the Dungeon of the Endless game, stranded on the planet. Hightech-dwarfs of a sort with heavy armor and the best science output. - The Rowing Clans are supposed to be the traders of the planet. They cannot declare war, are better than the NSA at finding out who's selling or buying what to a common marketplace you can get access to by research, and can actually even trade-ban people, bleeding them dry, economically. - The Drakken are the peacekeepers, a draconid race interested in achieving diplomatic victory by using their influence to force whole empires into peace or alliance with them. - The Ardent Mages can use spells on the map and in combat. Given enough currency, a weak army of them can still beat a superior foe with enough magic support fire. - The Necrophage do not do anything but feed, war and reproduce. Peace is not an option, as is not conquering. The Zergs of the planet, indeed. - The Broken Lords are living armors thinking of themselves as paladins and leeching life like vampires. Lorewise, one of my favourites, their gameplay is centered on currency to buy population with. - The Cultists of the Eternal End have only one city and expand by converting minor faction villages across the planet to generate troops for them and to harvest resources for them.  In general, this asymmetry is what makes the game nice, but it is also its vulnerability. As each faction plays differently, the AI also has to account for that. During the Early Access phase, the AI made huge jumps and has become a threat to the unwary at higher difficulty levels, now, but still fails in the endgame. It doesn't recognize that, given it is close to winning, the human player in the game will go to lengths to eradicate them. On the other hand, in the beginning, different AI personalities shine through. Around the Ardent Mages, there's always a lot of scorched earth destroyed minor faction villages, while Wild Walkers spread and pacify, instead. I'm quite confident that this will improve, further, but I rate what's present, now. Therefore I downright recommend to play this game in multiplayer. The simultaneous turns allow for fast games, compared to other titles. You can set turn timers and therefore force people to be fast, or give each and everyone as much time as they want, but a long game would last 4 hours, at most, on fast speed settings. Even there, though, the asymmetry of the game design has its dangers. You can equip your units with better and better equipment through the ages, having to use strategic resources on the map to get the very best, but there's a clear preference for some attributes being far better than others. Some units you gain by assimilating minor factions (you can then build their units and get some bonus per controlled village of that faction) are better than standard units and certainly better than most other units on the planet. I'm thinking of e.g. Kazanjii demons or Haunts of the Ended here, both having a chain hit special ability. One thing I have to add about the techtree: It is not linear, there's no clear progression. In each 'era', you have to choose at least x technologies, then you progress to the next era. Each time you research something, the cost for the next research increases, no matter the era its out of.  Overall, the game has a lot of depth for someone who favours empire management over combat. There's still lots of balancing and AI-tuning to do, but the game is fun and I recommend it.",

A lot of care went into making this game look good.  2. There is more to a good 4X than killing the other guy, and Endless Legend delivers with complex Empire Management. From tweaking production, to long term tech planning, you can control in detail more than just where your armies are going.  3. Usually, combat tends to be a chore, but no with Endless Legend. With Auto-Resolve for the 'easy' battles, you can focus on the important ones instead. The Tactical battle is a hybrid of Disciples and Age of Wonders, where you control your troops, but not everything they do. Also, new techs allow you to upgrade your armies with better equipment, and you can pick different bonuses as well, but all of it done in a non-time consuming way.  4. Factions do not just look different, but they actually feel different, and not in just subtle ways. At the same time, they feel balanced against one another, so every game never feels like one faction will always win. This extends to victory conditions, as each faction features their own unique quest line for victory!  Cons: 1. The A.I. can be a bit bi-polar sometimes, but it is by no means stupid (usually). The A.I. can and will kick your sorry hide if you let it, so for those looking for a single player only experience, you will find the A.I. to be more challenging than the A.I. in Civilization (which I have hundreds of hours in, including Deity wins).  2. Digging for information can be a minor chore, as some things are not really well explained, or obviously laid out. However, there is a lot of information and guides done by the community that are readily accessible to help you out.  Summary: I strongly recommend Endless Legend to anyone that is a 4X fan looking for their next fix. I play both Multi-player and Single-player, so this will easily continue to be one of the games I will be pouring many hours into. It takes all of what makes a good classic 4X strategy, and adds in some refreshing twists that will not disappoint.   tl;dr If you are familiar with losing an hour or more when you said 'just one more turn', then Endless Legend will not be kind to your sleep habits!",

Coming from someone who tried Endless Space and found it dry and unengaging, I must say that Endless Legend is an extremely significant improvement on its predecessor.   I'll be honest, the first two hours or so of this game, I had no idea what was going on (even after playing the tutorial). It took a second play through and watching a few 'Lets Play' videos on Youtube before I began to understand some of the basic and intermediate concepts more in depth.  Now, after some ~20 hours played on this game, I can say without doubt that this game is an absolute must-buy for any 4x fan. I have in those 20 hours only played two of the factions available, so there is a lot more to discover once I get around to trying the others. If you're a fan of fantasy, turn-based strategy, or Civilization, I would definitely recommend giving this game a shot.",

            "review_text": "Wow, this game is really something any 4x, strategy gamer should spend time on. I'm a huge CIV, Master of Orion fan among others and I never had so much fun since Civ 4 loaded with Mods and expansions and Endless Legend is still Vanilla.   The universe is story-rich, the graphics are really good, the soundtrack is immersive and the gameplay is nothing shy of Civ 5. I should say, there is a sense of deepness in this game that was lost a long time ago with the Civ Series. The different ressources you can get and their potential effects, the extended political and trading systems, the Hero and armies customizations. The different factions bring several ways to play the game and eventually win. I'm only 10 hours on this game so far and I'm still doubtful about to what extend the replay value will be lets say past when you won with every factions. I'm hoping there will be lots of good Mods and maybe expansions to push the limits of this game in the future.   Some people complained about the game crashing, so far I've experienced only one crash and thanks to the auto save feature, I was able to reload the last save without hassle.   In conclusion, this game is great, It's like a mother's caresss on a Civilization fan that felt left down by the last games they offered. Endless Legend HAS that one more turn feeling. Every turn brings its piece of action, being at war or at peace, there is plenty to manage and enjoy. It does not re-invent the genre, but it takes a well established concept and brings it in a Fantastic universe with a lot to explore and control. Have fun!",

You can't really get a unit to move to where you want it to and attack the specific enemy unit you wish. You pre select the target for each of your units and click 'launch'. As soon as an enemy unit moves, it prevents your orders being carried out and leads to your units walking all over the place. Ranged units walk to enemy infanty. Cavalry run infront of infantry, blocking their attacking position.   If this game had Eador style combat, it would be epic.",

            "review_text": "Endless Legend is a well built 4X game that has a unique flavor of its own, and does a lot of things that keep the game interesting at all stages. This is the initial draw for me, as other games (Civ, Endless Space) have a tendency to devolve into a click End Turn fest towards the end of the game.  First off, the factions of the game not only are different in terms of advatages and disadvantages, they each have a wildly different playstyle. My first game was as the Necrophages, and I felt like I was literally devouring the minor tribes and faction cities that I encountered. I produced little food on my own, but pacifying vilages gave me a boost, and I could feed my slain foes to a city for a growth boost.   The second thing I like about the game is how it forces the player to think long term and also consider his opponents when decided tech choices. Each level of tech has several choices, but every 9 techs researched opens the next level, forcing you to consider stay at the lower level to reseach those magic swords you need, or going up to the next level to research the wonders of the next age. Furthermore, the overall cost of technology increases with each researched, so any time spent on low level tech beyond the necessary gain slow your progression into later technologies.  Thirdly, I enjoyed the game's use of resources. Endless Legend has a resource system that I feel is much better done than Civ. All tiles immediatly surrounding your city are gathered, and you can expand your city to talk advantage of strange and unusual tiles. Also, as your city grows you can assign workers who can be focused on any of the 5 major resources. This means that you can found a city where you know you will make money and use workers to compensate for the food shortage. The game also sports 6 strategic resources that are used for building unique buildings and producing advanced armor and weapons for your troops, as well as 10 luxury resources that can be gathered and then activated for empire wide bonuses. This means that you will rarely find a resource and not be able to make use of it.  Endless Legend is a run and well designed game that I will probably play long after I have beaten it as all the major factions. It sports the expected unit and faction customization, so the possibilties are limited only by your imagination. I have not yet tried multiplayer, but I hear the experience is improving. This is a solid game I can easily recommend.  Barter? One does not barter with one's next meal...",

            "review_text": "Cons first! This game still bears the scars of being an early access game, and being developed on Unity. The 64-bit version is crashy (likely due to Unity), it has unnecessarily high system requirements (also Unity), there's some bits of the game that are still broken like a bunch of the text with the events and quests, and there's a weird sort of general feeling that the game is still not 100% complete. Unity is an awful engine and anyone reading this would be wise to avoid it if they're developing a game. On that note, I'm amazed at how well the devs of Endless Legend managed to polish that turd of an engine. Great effort.  Now for the good stuff, and there are a surprising amount of good things about this game! The art direction is simply fantastic. I absolutely love the art in this game, and the artists who worked on it are the best I've seen on any video game. Forget all those pretentious indie games whose main goal is to be art. This game is art, it knows it, and it feels no need to draw undue attention towards it. It's confident in what it is. It even helps the gameplay, and even though the game is hex-based, the landscape art simultaneously removes any jarring inter-hex transitions while also making a hex-grid helper overlay unnecessary. Simply amazing.  The gameplay reflects the care and attention they put on the art. It's solid 4X gameplay, every single faction plays very differently, and there's the option to make custom factions to play with and play against. The FIDSI mechanic and the way this game treats land grabbing and city/land improvements is a surprisingly good innovation on the old tired Civ-like mechanics. All strategic and luxury resources are produced on a per-turn basis with different modifiers depending on your faction and any events or quests. Very nice since it avoids the civ-style limited resource wars to prevent being locked out of certain buildings and units, but it also requires you to practice effective resource management.  The combat! I saw a lot of grumbling on reviews of this game and it made me hesitant to get it. Originally it seemed as if it was going to have combat like Endless Space, mostly just rock-paper-scissors doomstack-pushing. It was surprisingly different! On combat, armies spread throughout the surrounding landscape and it plays very much like a hex tactics game. Each unit type has different abilities, different strengths, different weaknesses, and these are all modified by your faction type, your technology, your heroes, and your customizable equipment. Equipment and heroes are customizable and you have to pay either production per unit or gold per hero, so you can have cheapo combat troops pushing forward while your expensive combat troops stay behind to finish them off. There's a surprising amount of flexibility here and it's better than most 4X games.  The quest system and the minor factions are locked together in terms of mechanics, and overall their random spread gives you something to worry about in the early-game. Not as completely horrendous and violent as pirates or barbarians or aliens in other 4X games, their pacification through quests, bribes, or destruction gives you direct bonuses if you colonize that region, and killing someone else's minor faction villages removes their bonuses from your enemy. They're another interesting strategic facet of the game.  The victory conditions are quite odd in that there's 8 of them and they cover almost every possible way you could think of winning a game like this. There's the requisite kill everything, love everything, research everything, and discover everything victories, but there's also a few odd ones like having loads of money and doing your faction's questline. Generally you'll be doing the faction questline or research victories, or an economic victory might sneak out of nowhere and win the game for you. Sometimes the AI will suddenly win an economic victory or pull a diplomatic victory off if you stop watching it. It's all very fun and has a lot of replayability compared to the conquest-dominated or research-dominated victories of Endless Space, or the conquest-dominated victories of the Civ series.  Overall this is a very very solid game made by developers who have clearly shown that they can and have improved. Vastly better than Endless Space, much better than pretty much any 4X made in recent years, and overall a very good game. That's coming from someone who liked the civ series (even 4 and V), BE, and Distant Worlds. Endless Legend is a better and more solid game than any of these. Less flashy, perhaps, but excellent in its gameplay and unified direction.  If Endless Space was any indication, there will be tons of free DLC packs and patches coming out in the next year or two, followed by an expansion or two, followed by more free DLC packs and patches for people who got the expansions. A very hearty recommend! Get this game if you enjoy 4X games!",

A nice array of equipment to choose and equip your heroes and troops. The game has quite a lot of factions to play and they do play very differently from one another, giving you a lot of replay value, as well as a lot of play styles and strategies to use. For instance you can go and build a huge empire with an entire array of cities with a certain faction, bur this same strategy might not work so well with another faction. The game does offer a lot of depth in almost every single aspect of a turn based 4X strategy game. You have a whole lot of resources you can explore and make use of, a lot of special tiles with different effects. Minor factions you can actually assmilate to your empire and add to your strategies. Heroes leveling is also interesting, since you can have quite a few options to focus on, such as a army commander or a city mayor.  Another truly commendable aspect of the game is its soundtrack. Its really amazing, one of the best I've seen in this genre so far. You never, absolutelly never get tired of it.

First a bit about the game, there is a learning curve, the tutorial is out there and will get you started, but by know means extensive so a few restarts are normal. While playing on the 'very easy' level is really not much of a challenge against the AI, I would play a game there just so you can get the mechanics down, you really do need to learn to keep a close eye on your growing empire, this comes more apparent as you move up in the level you want to play. There are a lot of limiting factors in the game, each balancing out the play. You do have to pay attention to your growth and your cities or you can find yourself resource poor, money poor, influence poor and so far behind the eight ball you will be hitting the start of a new game from the main menu.  Graphics and Sound, personally graphics in a 4x game is the least important, and the map can be a bit of a challenge graphically wise, but nothing that is a stopper. Sound, I typically don't even play with the sound on, so not important. Unit Graphics are nice, and meet the needs of the game. Overall the look is fine.  Interfaces, not perfect, but not hard to navigate, you don't have to go down more than one to two levels to find what you need. So getting where you need to go, and getting what you need to get done, is quick. Movement is click on a unit and move the cursor to where you want to go then mouse click. Easy enough.  The game play, this game is a 'Just One More Turn' game. This is what a good 4x game does, in my opinion, you get rolling and there is always something to do, and somewhere to go, especially in the mid game. There is a lot of checks and balances in the game to prevent over expansion as your empire population gets unhappy with you expanding to quickly. So the game is not just about expanding and grabbing every region as you will find yourself with an unhappy population which effects your cities outputs. Low outputs, means slower production, slower population growth etc.....  There are lots of resources in the game, some of which makes more powerful units, others give bonuses to your region and city. Building a city in the right place is important, as being able to control your growth and expand your city takes planning of your new Districts, you get bonuses for a good growth. The game balances this nicely with the tech research. You can choose pretty much any tech in your Era you are not limited to a path, keep in mind that you may need to shift how you research through out the game as you try to balance the game and meet the needs. Do you select researching a more powerful unit, or do you select bonuses that allow you to equip current units with more powerful weapons. Do you select production buildings over money making Buildings. Typically there is an ever increasing cost to opening new research no matter what the era, so selecting a research you passed in Era 1 while you unlocked Era 4, does not really quicken your research.   Over all this game has a lot going for it, continued DLC support adds challenges and new leaders and factions. 9/10, especially since it is on sale.  ",

Pros - Staggeringly beautiful worldmap  - Masterclass in user interface and style - Constant hard-hitting decisions and prioritizations - Genuine differences between races - Well written, with fun lore - Lots and lots of innovative ideas  Cons - It's not a super-polished game. You'll find things that aren't quite right. Nothing that breaks the game, and in general it just gives the game texture and alleys to explore. - Combat isn't quite right. You know the fun tacticality of Civ V and VI? Well, it's absent here. There's both an initiative system and a pre-order unit action system, which combines screwily, which doesn't quite give the depth of play they were hoping for. Not to mention some oddities (archers that shoot too far, awkward zone of control, etc.)  - Tilted end games. It's the usual problem. Either you or the AI snowball and become Godlike, meaning it's either a simple walk to victory or complete trashing. AI has trouble making comebacks from setbacks. Also, when you're winning, you can take your pick of victory options, which is too bad. March on capitals, win by science, quest victory are not always exclusive. - Boring exploration. In the beginning, you run around searching ruins. Sounds fun, right? Unfortunately, there's rarely anything in them but money, occasionally a fetch and destroy quest. (Update: the expansions mostly resolve this issue)   Oh, and yes please to Endless Legends 2.   - UPDATE - After playing with the expansions (Guardians and Shifters), I can say they make the game categorically better. Do buy them! (Especially after a game or two on the base edition to get the hang of it.)  PROTIPS - - You can adjust the attack animation speed in the options menu - Try setting the world map to 'mountainous.' It's fun! - Try setting the turn-based mode to 'advanced.' That way, you only give orders every two rounds, which streamlines combat and makes it more fun and feels more tactical.",

            "review_text": "Endless Legend is like Civ, which is fantastic because Civ is a great, sturdy game, with some flaws though. There are some differences between the two.  In Endless Legend, you have 9 aysmmetrical (completely different) factions to choose from (with the exception of 2 as far as I know), each have their own ways of obtaining victory in an easier way, much like Civ, there's Expansion, Elimination, Science, Diplomatic, and so on...  Unlike most RTS's and TBS's/4Xs (Turn-Based Strategies), In Endless Legend, each faction only has 3 different military units.  Now, I know what you're thinking: Where's the diversity?!?! BUT, the COOLEST thing about your armies is that you can change what weapons, armour, and trinkets they can have equipped, depending on what you have researched at the time, and then retrofit your current armies to have the newest equipment, adding in an RPG-like element! Also, better equipment made from different alloys you research have special properties to each of them that add damage to certain enemies (flying, infantry, etc...) or that buffs your unit or army (regen, health boost, etc...). Same goes for heroes, in which you start out with one hero, then can buy more via in-game marketplace you have to research to unlock first. Also, all armies and heros level up over time, making them more powerful, and for heros, have a skill tree.  ALSO, so that just 3 units doesn't discourage you; There are what's called 'minor' factions that are basically neutral camps all over the different regions. If you have a city in that region, and destroy the minor faction's little base, you can assimilate them, thereby being able to produce the combat units that they create as well, so there's a lot more to it than just the 3 base units you have!  Personally, just having 3 units is so much better, so you don't have to build a crap ton of different units and worry about 'what is strong/weak against what' and have a huge ordeal over it.  The combat is supremely better than Civ, being that, there's actually combat (lol sarcasm...sorta). The combat is completely tactical, meaning once you initiate a battle, you get to organize your force on the board, and then take turns targeting and attacking/defending attacks, it actually takes some tactical knowledge to win a battle! Unlike Civ, where you just send a gajillion people into one square/hexagon and hope for the best. But if you know you're going to win a battle without any casualities (in which the game gives you statistics before you go into battle), you can auto sim the fight so you don't waste time on your turn.  There's a lot more that I would like to say, but most people won't read this far anyway.... SO:  Pros ___________ -Beautiful Graphics -Aysmmetrical Factions - Very, Very Solid Gameplay - Fantastic Combat System - The 'Endless' Universe, which is freaking sweet - Simple Army System (3 diff military) With Awesome Equipment Interchangeability  Cons ____________ - If you haven't played Civ, it's going to take a little bit to get used to the interface and everything....but that's common sense. No turn-based game is easy the first time around. -There's only one faction that is preferred to win by elimination, which is perfectly fine, but they can't go to peace, an alliance, or even trade things with other factions. If you're using that faction and playing with friends you want to ally with, you're not going to be able to, unless you can pre-organize teams in the menu before starting the game (whether you can or not, i'm not sure, haven't had much time to play to find that out yet).  - I can't think of anything else.  Other Thoughts ____________ In the past, I would've totally recommended Civ and I have played it a lot with a bunch of friends over time. But, Endless Legend changes everything. Don't buy Civ, buy this game, it's just better. I highly recommend it.",

It was easier to understand than Endless Space though I do like that one also due to the very good tutorial in Endless Legend. I went through the complete tutorial as it explains how to do everything in the game. The game is very much Civilization like in that you build the buildings and military you want in your city. You can also grow your city larger by building Boroughs. Each section or area of the map can contain only 1 city so there is no need to figure out the spacing between your cities. There are a variety of races to choose from. Each Race only has 3 different Military units that you can build but if you Assimilate a Minor Faction you can also build their military units also. You can also upgrade the 3 Different Military unit choices you have with better weapons and armor and items which all the units of that type that you build in the future will have. Your Armies or cities can also be led by heroes who level up and gain new abilities when they do through the assigning of skill points. You can taylor your Hero to be better at giving a city food, dust or production for instance or you can make your hero a Military killing machine by making the armies he leads have greater life or attack , etc. Heros and other units can also engage in quests through exploring ruins which adds a small role playing element to this beautiful 4X strategy game. Everything is turn based and you can fight combat in turn based mode to have more control or just put it on Auto combat. At first I fought everything in turn based combat to micromanage my troops but I found it sped up the game by going to automatic combat and the computer did a pretty good job of accessing losses. You also have faction quests you can complete and if you finish them you can build a wonder and win the wonder victory. I highly recommend this game for any gamer but especially those who like Sid Meier's Civilization games. This game is far better than Beyond Earth and Endless Space is far better than Beyond Earth. This games compare more favorably to the actual Civilization titles like Civ 5, civ 1, 2,3,4. I have played 236 hours and have all the achievement now so I am moving on to another game. I have enjoyed my playtime on this game very much however. The game at first had many lock ups and bugs when the game would go on longer but I think the developers have been doing a very good job fixing bugs and I haven't had a game lock up or kick me out in some time now. GREAT GAME. Also the game has a Summer and Winter season and you have to plan for the winter season or you could be in trouble as production, dust, etc go down during the winter and movement is slowed.",

(i pretty much always let the fights resolve on automatic, the problem is that u cant skip forward if you are in manual mode once and often its quite obvious how it will turn out, so why keep having to click around).  so back to the story: luckily the krim island had two groundtiles so i was able to land there with my own armies and this way i had more tiles to attack his army from than him and i won. This would be a great cool thing but there is one problem: He could theoretically destroy my entire city fortification and destroy my entire city just because i cant get to his army from any vantage point. Even though his army is only able to siege my massive city from one tiny district.  just to be clear, this is quite an unlikely thing to happen but it happened. in general i like it but its REALLY hard to tell how good an army will fight against mine. his units are lvl 6, but his hero has better items maybe? who knows. Then he has a demon, ok that has a swipe attack but who knows how well it will be used.  most of the time you really need to have more guardian elite units than him to win any fights in late game.  also what i wanted to mention about the confusing language: the items for the heros say something like +2 iniative for army.  What the hell is initiative? There are tons of things that arent explained at all properly  multiplayer useless, one game is running, 2 russians, refuse to speak english, constantly desyncs, people randomly join and leave the game and it takes minutes each time   Overall i can recommend this game as a better alternative than Civ 5, actually imo it is a lot better. The AI however is almost as bad as Civ, I mean i get it.. it's hard to make a good AI but it seems that they make the AI very lenient... why does it allow me to truce when it could very easily kill me?

You hire a hero recruit units and explore the map founding and upgrading cities along the way. It has much more depth and polish than that game however. The DLC is pretty cheap if you wait for sales and adds nice touches to the game. Another nice thing is that the DLC unlocked is based on the host, so if one person in the group has everything unlocked and he hosts his friends only need the basic game. The music is fantastic and I play it all the time when doing homework or browsing the web. The art is very good and I use it as wallpaper often. It looks great.  The only downside to the game is matches can take 10 or 12 hours to complete for larger maps. The game can be saved so this is not all in a row, but still it can be hard to coordinate with friends to finish a game. The other downside is you are going to need to play about 3 matches to learn the game. I've played several matches and several partial matches and there are still things I need to learn.

It has elements of all the things that I enjoy while maintaining its core in the 4x realm. It brings intricacy and tactics to military battles that is so sorely needed in this genre. It removes the stale taste of 'here's my unit' and brings a refreshing diversity to combat and Hero mechanics. With each research 'era' you gain a dust equipment improvement. However, the player can choose to specialize in certain equipment that is built through other strategic resources, which while providing a noted advantage, do not in any way erode the fair playing field. Research is non linear and offers the player a REAL choice to capitalize on their strengths, or improve their weaknesses whether that is due to terrain or circumstance. The graphics are absolutely stunning. You can zoom in for detail, or zoom out for tactical, both are gratifying. My only annoyance is that character models do not change through the improvement of armor. The marketplace is very intricate and offers a HUGE side-game that can be exploited to the player's advantage, or ignored entirely without much ill-effect. Winter comes to the land more and more frequently as the game progresses, and ensures that if you aren't prepared for it, then you will suffer the consequences. People complain about it, but it evens the playing the field and allows certain tactical advantages to the player that hasn't quite had the best of luck throughout the game, but at the same time, if you are powerful, it really shines in this stage. Factions are diverse, and every aspect of that is customizable if you so choose. Hands down and without a doubt, support this group of developers.

Ruins and the like are balanced in that they provide different rewards based on your current tech level, and while there is a chance to discover a rediculous weapon, it won't be equippable until you have that resource, preventing random steam rolls. Even better though, is that each player benefits from exploration, regardless if another player already did. Letting you play the game at your own pace rather than be rushed into clearing out 'huts'.  All of the systems are linked together, tech, cities, heroes, units, exploration and the game is adequately paced (incremental research costs, expansion penalties) so that the game isn't immediately decided once a single player has an edge. There are multiple paths to victory, though probably only 4 of those are unique. And the races play differently to one another, at least 3 of which are notably different enough to completely alter your style of play.  The only gripe I have with the game is that the empire editing mechanic is supremely unbalanced. Empire attributes are foolishly priced and empires start with more or less than the starting points they should have. Fortunately this is pretty minor, as effective army and empire design will trump any bonuses you may or may not have.

The bad: * Still some significant bugs, including ones that make it impossible to finish a game even from saves. * No real documentation or tutorial for a lot of the good new concepts--you just have to figure out a lot of things by trial and error. Though this can also be fun--'Oh, *that's* how that works....' * The notification system--that a city is not producing anything, or that you aren't researching any tech, is easy to miss, leading to turns of no production and no research unless you remember to check it every turn. * The AI is pretty weak, and probably always will be, due to the complexity of the options available. * The UI can be frustrating and confusing.  If you're willing to learn by trial and error as you go, and have a high tolerance for bugs, there are some really good new concepts here. If not, you might wait a couple of months until some good beginner's guides are written and the game is more stable.  If you do play it now--notifications appear as icons on the right side of the screen. Make sure you click on every one every turn--they disappear as soon as you hit End Turn. And the circle around End Turn has an arrow circle icon next to it--click on that every turn to move your armies, or they'll just sit where they are doing nothing.

            "review_text": "Before I type anything else, let me preface this review by saying that the thumbs up I give this game is a very, very hesitant one.   Right. Endless Legend is a game by Iceberg Interactive, the strapping folks behind Endless Space. The general consensus for that is while it was a competent 4X with a very good interface, there was very little actual 'meat' to be had.   And honestly, that's how it feels here.   The game itself is like any familiar 4X: you start out with a hero (who can settle your first town), along with a few token soldiers to help you explore the world. Bigger cities mean more gold, and more production, and more research.   However, Endless Legend throws a few other things into the mix. Some work, some don't.   First, there's the quest system. Every race has their own unique quests, along with rather generic ones that anyone can get. And honestly, most of the quests are rather dull. Usually some iteration of 'go to X'. Most of them just feel plain unsatisfying to complete, and feel like a chore.   Second, there's the Empire Plan mechanic. 20 turns into the game, you get to set an Empire Plan, which gives your civilization buffs depending how many infulence points you have to spare towards the investments. Once again, it was good to see Iceberg experiment with something new in a 4X, but implementation was lacking.   The one thing I did really like was the villager system. Villages are small settlements that belong to minor races, and you can recruit their special units through either defeating them in battle or bribing them. It was something that really made me feel like I was building an empire through a foundation of alliances and trade, which is always nice.   The biggest problem this game has, and it's something that's hard to quantify, is that the game just feels *slow*. And not because of its demands on the computer, but just the pace of the game itself. Characters, even on the fastest setting, still take forever to lumber across the map and use up their move points, the battle system is largely the same, and there's just no 'snap' like you'd feel in Civ IV, or Gal Civ II, or hell, even Fallen Enchantress.  And this last one is a personal thing, but I've always hated the 'magic is actually forgotten technology' setting. It just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  You might notice I've said a lot of bad things about this game, but I'm still recommending it. Well, despite its flaws, it's still a rather addictive and competent 4X. It's got its problems, very avoidable ones, but it has a very solid base. If Iceberg's willing to make the effort, they could turn this from a mediocre 4X to one of the greats.",

            "review_text": "Endless Legend is very much in the vein of civilisation but with a fantasy setting. It has more depth than many games of its ilk with a wide range of troops, minor factions and resources. Unlike many modern games the factions are very different with unique play mechanics that making using a different faction a very different experience. Recommended for fans of fantasy strategy games.    Added after 23 hours play:  Having played this for longer there are game crashing bugs and occasional errors. Autosaves happen every turn to rescue you from this. If you get errors without a crash then it is best to exit the game as re-opening the game can fix the errors. Hopefully these issues will be fixed in a future patch but be warned if you see an error the game may crash in a future turn but your save is probably fine if you restart.  Some of the features I like from this game:  Seasons mean winter suddenly drops your food and other production, poorly designed empires can find them selves starved. Troops move slowly in winter and it gives a sensible pause in war efforts. Once you have troops with winter resistence via high level skills you can gain advantages in the winter.  Diplomacy has a default state of cold war, one step from peace or war. Peace and Alliances must be researched before being offered and military players can not only ignore diplomacy but also ignore chunks of the research options.  Troops can be edited to give them the latest equipment, then troops built on those original builds can be retrofitted to the current build.  Heroes stationed in cities earn experience as quickly or faster than combat Heroes. The earn experience for everything built at the city so defensive and peaceful empires can still build powerful heroes. Heroes also have a whole chain of skills focused on city boosting.  Each faction has a recommended victory type to aim for. Cultists for example can only build one city and expand through village conversion instead. Each village gives them resouces, an extra city worker and troops are generated for free in the village. The city can grow a level higher than any other faction and numbers of workers in the end game can be very high due to all the villages converted. To play each faction to the full you need to embrace there game mechanic and just playing each faction gives a lot of replay.  Difficulty is simpler than other games in the ilk as long as you follow the correct playstyle for your faction and utilise your heroes fully. Anything below normal should be treated as training and normal may be to easy if you play a lot of strategy games.  My first playthroughs with the Wind Walkers took 15+ hours and my second play with Cultists taking less than 8 hours.  If you ignore the story line quests and focus on a quick win on maps other than huge you could do this in a much shorter time. Playing the remaining factions I expect to spend another 30-60 hours trying out the other 6 main factions.",

It's focused on tech research and city building and administration like Civilization but still has the very interesting tactical aspect of combat of AoW; moreover, you still have the possibility to upgrade your current units and heroes with the latest weapons, armor and artifacts you have researched -- a bit like what you can do in Stardock's Fallen Enchantress or in the classic Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.  A novel aspect of EL with respect of all the games I've mentioned is that the game map is divided into regions and each region can host upto one town only; this makes things a bit more interesting as the town has to be placed strategically in accordance with which resources the single region has to offer.  The graphics style is really appealing to me, and the music (that you get also in MP3 format bundled with the game download for free) really nails the mood and tempo of the game.  The only bad thing that I can say about EL is that the AI isn't very challenging at all; sometimes it could just stay idle in its initial territory for the most part of the match -- that's what happened to the Mezari in my first ever game. If this one issue is fixed, EL can become a true classic gem of the genre.  My vote: 8.5/10  PS: I'm still waiting for the Linux release!",

            "review_text": "Cookie cutter, copy paste, same-same. These are all words that have been used to describe many, many 4x strategy games in recent years. For those few that are not in the 'know', 4x stands 'eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate'. In the past the 4x genre was an interesting and innovative hybrid of strategy games. Unfortunately many have been taking the 'safe' route. (Read UNinteresting and UNinnovative.)  Then Endless Legend walked into the room like a boss, announced that it didn't like the tried and true. It told us that it didn't care what people thought of it. And it truly doesn't, and I love it for that. It brought us many new or semi new features, some that it came up with on it's own, some that it borrowed.  The first thing that comes to mind, is the region system. Gone are the days of spamming cities on every open piece of dirt, whether valuable or not, (Cough-Civ series-Cough) Now every section of the vast continents of land is divided up by regions in which only one city may settle upon. Certain factions are even penalized for expanding onto them too quickly. It creates an atmosphere that makes each and every one of the cities in your kingdom seem more unique and important. Instead of thinking of it as just another city, now I think of it by its name and history.  Speaking of regions, there are a wealth of resources in them, both strategic and luxury that can implemented in different manners. Sell and trade them or use them as boost for different affects. They apply different bonuses for your cities, troops and for you kingdom overall. Resources not enough for you? How about natives? Each region has different native populations that can be assimilated, either by force, bribery or peaceful means. Different species bring interesting boosts to the region and can even be recruited. Ever felt like fielding an army of wolf/human hybrids? Now you can.  ---  All layers of the standard 4x are here, diplomacy, economy, expansion and combat. All are done well. I really enjoyed the diplomacy, and that happens to be a vastly overlooked feature in most strategy games. But not here. My only wish is that many of the features were not locked behind technology research.  Now that I mentioned technology, Endless Legends has its own view on research trees. It is rather standard with only a few minor twists, there being 6 different ages, all bringing new technologies to research. Sometimes it seems cluttered and sometimes big decisions must be made. I'm not a huge fan and I hope they rework it through patches. But it's not big enough of a problem to really detract from the game overall.  ---  That's racist. With only 8 different races to choose from, it may sound like their aren't a-lot of options there. But instead of 40 different copy-paste races with a few minor bonuses to switch things up with, Endless legends 8 races all play vastly different from each-other and make each play-through seem like you're playing a different game altogether. In the wise wise words of Lloyd Christmas, 'I like it alot'.  ---  Troops and heroes. The backbone of every 4x, at first glance it appears that this is one of the down failings of Endless Legend, when in fact it is a strong point. Your standard kingdom only has 4 different soldiers, which sounds like a bummer. That is until you realize that they can be upgraded in many different ways and the aforementioned native and independent troops that can be bought, traded or assimilated into you kingdom. All customizable. True, they aren't as customizable as some games have striven to make theirs, but in Endless Legends, your choices on each piece of gear is strategically important. My only complaint here is that upon equipping a new piece of armor, one cant visibly see a difference in the character sprite, that is slightly disappointing and will hopefully be patched later on. On to heroes! While they can be leveled up, perks and bonuses chosen, extra gear and and gadgets equipped, they seem rather dull. Don't get me wrong, they are very important to a successful army, just the heroes themselves have no real personalities or real distinctiveness, which in a unique game full of personality, it really sticks out like a sore thumb.  ---  Music and graphics. While these two are less important for a strategy game, they really do need mentioning. Rarely have I seen or heard such a beautiful game. The graphics are georgeus and relay a real sense of immersion. I believe this may be the most graphically lush 4x I've ever played. The music is phenomenal. I've never bought a game's soundtrack before, but I will this one. The music is rendered in the up-most quality, I can't say I've heard such a soundtrack since Arcanum. and that is the biggest complement I can fathom.  ---  Overall, I give this game a high recommendation for any fan of 4x strategy games. It managed to pull me deeper than many of its peers in the gaming market. I do not regret this purchase in the slightest, and that coming from a poor man, well that means a-lot. There are some balancing issues here and there, but with Amplitude-Studios track record, it's safe to say that they will be fixed shortly. That and the addition of modding support, the only direction this game is going, is up. I've seen what dedicated moders can do with the proper support and that has the potential to add years and years of playability. If your into 4x and you want something that doesn't come from an assembly line, you couldn't do better than Endless Legends especially for the price. For those poorer gamers like myself, Christmas time at Steam is coming!",

If you took Civ 5 and expanded on and improved every aspect you would get something very much like this game. The world is beautiful, the combat is tactical and far more dynamic than civ because of fully customizable units, the different factions are actually DIFFERENT with their own units and distinct playstyles.  The only thing that is a little disappointing to me is the lack of noticable difference in gameplay as you advance through the tech trees. Your economy gets much stronger and unit stats go up but you are still using the same units, whereas in civ you go all the way from crude stoneage weapons to a modern military with an airforce and nuclear weapons. I suppose that is the result of having a game take place in a fantasy universe. That aside, however, the game is very fun and any fan of the civ series shouldn't think twice about buying it.",

            "review_text": "Endless Legend took me by surprise. I have been a huge Civilization 5 player, with 263 hours on file at the moment, and my heart had always belonged with that game. I recently found interest in Endless Legend and purchased it and I think its a game that every fan of the 4x genre should play or at least look into.   Pros: 1. Beautiful, intriguing world. Tons of inventive lore infused throughout the game. 2. Emphasis on effective empire management. City-building, economy balancing, and researching the tech-circles are really fun. There is also a great emphasis on resource management, each worker you unlock can be placed in different points of emphasis for more resource gain. If you are play a science victory you may want more workers placed in science production to research quickly. If you are playing a supremacy race you may be more interested in placing your workers in industry so you can build units/city expansions quicker, etc... 3. Combat is done nicely. You can choose to tactically face your opponent in a way that sort of reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic. It is turn-based and there may be some strategy. If you don't like that you can choose to spectate and watch the computer make your moves for you or you can just auto-resolve and move on. If you auto-resolve or spectate, you can choose for the computer to be aggressive or passive as well. You can also upgrade units with new weapons that you can craft through the research tree, or find in quests. 4. Different factions that actually play quite differently. Some factions just simply cannot do certain things. Such as the necrophage, they can't create peace treaties. They are simply a faction that is meant to kill everything. Playing as the necrophage you may want to push all your workers into industry in order to build your improvements/milita quicker. Playing as the ardent mages you may want to move your workers into science production so that you can rush through the research tree and race to a science victory. There is even a faction that relies solely upon Dust (the games gold currency). 4. Some innovative features that haven't been seen in 4x genre. For example: race-specific quest lines that actually serve as a unique victory condition, seasonal effects (summer/winter), the concept of regions limiting city placement, reinforcements, how heroes are handled (as generals or governors), etc., etc. 5. The seasonal affects may actually impact some factions play. I know that whenever I enter the winter my production slows greatly. I end up losing roughly 60 gold per turn and most of the units can only move 1 space or so.  6. You can assimilate with minor factions and build/upgrade their units once you acquire them. They also have bonuses that they will provide to your city once you control them. 7. The artstyle is very intriguing. 8. It isn't like other 4x titles. In fact it does a very good job at seperating itself from other 4x titles (civ 5, age of wonders, etc..) 9. You can create your own factions with all the different perks and army units that are provided in the base game. So if you don't like the factions that are in the game you can customize your own from the bottom up.  Cons: 1. A.I. is kind of bad with certain factions. With the Drakken they are really strong but with some of the other factions they act kind of stupid. This is the game's greatest downfall. But with the modding community helping this out and patches still being worked on (i think) this will come to an end hopefully. 2. It would be cool if there were more factions. I'm sure there are other factions you can download through mods but it would've been cool to see more than just 9 factions in the base game. 3. To some this is a con: The game is not as easily learned as something like Civ 5. Each turn you have to remember where your units were, you have to remember which direction they were heading, and what they were doing. There is more micromanaging in this game with emphasis on what workers produce which things. There are some things you may even have to wiki as well. There is a lot of things you will just learn the more you play considering the game doesn't really hold your hand at all. Even the tutorial is very basic and doesn't quite go over everything you will face in the game itself.  Summary: When i play this game i instantly compare this game to an RPG. There are very many RPG like elements that are fused with the 4x style and this game does it VERY well. The artstyle is very unique and the way it plays is somewhat similar to what HeroScape was like back in the day. In my opinion it is more smooth that Civ 5 and there is more thought that is required within each turn. There aren't many situtations where you will just sit there and continuously hit the end-turn button. There is always a goal in each turn whether it is working towards the factions quests, trying to parley and assimilate with a minor faction, or expand. Yes, the AI needs improvement, but overall I think this is a great game. I wouldn't even say that the AIs mistakes are as noticeable as some of the other strategy games that exist. Playing on higher difficulties even create a loss more often than not so I think that creates a nice challenge sometimes.",

This is quite disappointing given the epic(ly dank) atmosphere the lore sets up, but I think it's a fairly fun MP title to play with friends. The quest mechanic is also a poor fit for this game, it conflicts too much with the strong 4x identity because of how random its progression is.

I didn't get to it until after the summer sale, which I immediately regretted. I expected to give it a few hours, but got totally sucked in. As I started to play after the sale, I was contemplating waitng for another sale to buy the DLCs, but screw that. I bought them right away, as the developers deserve EVERY penny. I just don't understand how this game did not get as much coverage (or any) as it deserves. For someone new to the genre it probably isn't the best place to start. I'd recommend Civ 5. However for anyone who played any 4X game before, or is excited over Civ 6, it seems that many of the features are already here. Endless legend is a bit harder to get into, but trust me, it's worth it. The faction differences, are not 10% faster building of something, or 2 units at the start, oh no... The difference here is that you can't use science, or declare wars, or have more cities and so on. Every faction plays different, requires different strategy or tactics. The battles are also not just about numbers, but imagine a HOMAM kind of fight (that you can automate/skip if you think you overpower the enemy). I can't reccomend this game highly enough. The setting is awesome, the music is awesome, the graphics are awesome, the lore is awesome, the gameplay is awesome, shortly put this game is totally awesome.

The devs are also a great group of people with regards to pricing and DLC whom I will gladly support with a couple extra dollars here and there. The setting, music, and artwork are all excellent. My only real gripe with an otherwise excellent game are the victory conditions, which feel bland especially compared to Civ - there's the standard conquer and expand, but science, wonder, and faction quest victories are 'research every late game tech' 'discover all of this thing that is marked on the map' and 'build a thing for your faction' respectively.

            "review_text": "Endless Legend: A Rough Diamond   It has taken me about eight months to finally articulate how I feel about Endless Legend. I tried to review this game back in February… and I got lost in vast paragraphs of technical minutiae… Much like actually playing Endless Legend!  I’m not going to lie, Endless Legend is technical to a fault. There are a TON of systems in this game... And they are not explained as well as they could be, which often times left me guessing.  But that doesn’t mean that Endless Legend isn’t fun. In fact I was almost late for work because of this game. I simply lost track of time, I was having such a good time. Despite some rather obtuse systems that, honestly, after almost 50 hours I still probably couldn’t properly articulate, I really do like Endless Legend. As I’m sure you can tell by the title of this review.   In fact, I might like it more than Civilization V. Which is a bold thing to say; ‘cause I love me some Civ V.  Not to mention I have spent more than double the amount of time in Civ - 100 hours.  There is something refreshing about Endless Legend that just endears me to it, despite some rough edges. Perhaps it is that I had a massive hankering for a ‘fantasy/sci-fi Civ-like’ game around the time Endless Legend came out... And ‘Beyond Earth’ looked incredibly disappointing to me.  The truth is it’s probably because Endless Legend is incredibly creative, and gives each of its eight races a distinct difference that changes how they are played in a pretty meaningful way. As an example, the Necrophages-- Bug-men, cannot engage in diplomacy. They can only wage war. Or the Broken Lords, living suits of armor, who do not require food due to them not technically having bodies.  Almost each race has a decent gameplay twist that makes them stand out from the others, and decent enough ‘lore’ to motivate you to play by their particular rules.  Amplitude did a very good job of setting up the world of Endless Legend, everything feels rooted in their particular universe. This game has loads of character; even the landscape takes on a persona as you play through the game. The game map includes verticality that can create very beautiful landscapes, as well as harsh and unforgiving terrain. Along with verticality the game has a seasonal system in place that changes from ‘Summer’ to ‘Winter’ after a set amount of turns. Winter changes everything about the game. And gives a wonderful, ebb and flow to the gameplay. Where you are always thinking in terms of “X, Y, and Z need to be done before winter comes…”   There were plenty of “Winter is coming” jokes, when playing with friends.  However, much like real life, winter can drag on forever and cause a fair amount of frustration as you are severely limited in what you can do while waiting for summer to begin again. During winter all production is slowed, and unit movement is reduced; never, ever, start a war with winter on your heels.   I always found myself dreading winter. Despite genuinely thinking it’s a very cool concept that I really appreciate. I know that’s weird but, hey, I like Dark Souls… My main annoyance with the game’s seasons is that as the game progresses winter becomes longer and more frequent… This is due to the planet, Auriga, dying and slowly stopping its rotation.   I told you the landscape had character.   And while winter as a mechanic is super cool, sometimes I just want to get my army across a continent in under 20 turns.  Overall, I think Winter as a mechanic is a perfect example of Endless Legend as a whole: Very creative, and very original. But its implementation could have been better. Although I can’t necessarily articulate how it could be better.   There are multitudes of intellectually interesting mechanics in this 4X game that, unfortunately, just have rough edges. And I don’t think it’s for lack of effort on the developer’s part. I genuinely think it’s because they are just, well... intellectual.  I once read a critique of Isaac Asimov that said he wrote like an engineer. And I think that might be a perfect way to describe Endless Legend. Endless Legend feels very mechanical. I could compare it to an engine, with hundreds of moving parts, that I only have a very tangential understanding of their purpose or function. But instead I’ll say that: “Art imitates life”...  Wait, hold on, let me explain myself before we get into an “Are games art?” discussion!  I say this because, Endless Legend is more of a simulator than a 4X game. This might seem odd to say, but the scenarios my friends and I found ourselves in were shockingly close to real politics. And the mechanics of Endless Legend facilitated their depth in a way that Civ could not.   For example:  As you progress through the game's various technological tiers, and eras, you develop more and more powerful weapons and armor for your troops, should you have a military bent-- like myself. But if you’ve been waging a ten thousand year war-- as I tend to do, the troops you deployed at the beginning of your futile conflict will still be rocking the sticks you gave them during the stone age. While the new troops you send out have Glassteel swords and shields and advanced combat training.  Winter will hit just as you’re one turn away from completing that incredibly important building upgrade, and completely derail your plans for about 12 turns.  Money truly is power, and those who have it will hold power over those who don’t.  The more industrious you are, the more unhappy your people will be. Finding the perfect balance between expanding your territory and placating your populace is a hard balance. Looking forward and seeing what your Empire could be, while being held back but what it currently is.  Land disputes, that turn into full on wars over small chunks of ore.  Becoming mired down in conflict that slowly eats away at both parties leaving them hollow and weak, but failing to destroy either.  Massive swings in geopolitical power. Underdogs becoming super-powers. Then losing their lead due to jealous raids on their territory.  Arguments over what to do with indigenous peoples. Subjugation, or annihilation? Making agreements over territories, because of their indigenous occupants.  “Let me subjugate the Centaurs, and I will allow you to settle the land next to me…”  Geopolitical frustrations due to the fact that one half of the world is fighting over scarce resources, while the other half is occupied by a lone super-power gobbling up everything in their sight. And the stress and fear of knowing that everything you do is more than likely futile as you viciously try to carve out your own foothold. And then selfishly hold to your territory before the inevitable oceanic invasion as your continental neighbor turns their sights on the valuables you so desperately cling to…  Futilely trying to end a war with your closest neighbor, and trying to point their aggression away from yourself, and towards the more pressing threat.  “We have to stop fighting or the Necrophages will kill both of us!”  Waging a secret war with your “ally” using Private Military Contractors fighting your wars for you. All the while your neighbor sends his own men to futily fight off an army under an anonymous banner.  Knowing your “ally” is sending mercenaries to slowly kill you via attrition, and being unable to retaliate due to their political relationships…  Endless Legend is a game that manages to come shockingly close to reality, while also being a Science Fantasy universe far from it.  I would recommend picking up Endless Legend. Although it has plenty of rough edges, and some frustrating mechanics… The times that I didn’t have fun, were few and far between.  If you’re skeptical, pick this one up on sale. I highly doubt you will regret your purchase.  Like this review? Check out  100hoursave.com  for more.",

But the music and the artwork and the general theme are all pretty engaging.   I do wish that 'magic' would have played a bigger part in this game, granted i havn't explored everyunit there is, but i don't really see any fireballs or lightning bolts available and the setting certainly would allow that kind of stuff.

            "review_text": "My very first 4X game, Endless Legend grabbed my attention above Civ V and Beyond Earth by forgoing a real life setting in favor of a fantasy one. In that regard, EL surprassed my initial expectations. The world of Auriga is fleshed out, rich with lore. and full of curious races and factions to cross.  Each of the playable factions contain a seperate story campaign to accomplish, and each play quite differently. Your playthrough with the peacful and democractic Drakken will prove very different from your playthrough with the aggressive Necrophages.  Gameplay in EL is saturated, but not to a fault (I'm still learning after all!). There's a decent tutorial, but to really sink your teeth into it you'll need to sit down for a campaign. Fortunately there's plenty of ways to personalize a campaign's difficulty and world. Unfortunately, it can become a chore to learn, as there's an abundance of sciences and unit customization. Some unit passives and build paths can be poorly explained, and it'll take some digging on your part to really understand how you should be playing a faction to its potential.  Fortunately there's plenty of guides available. The online experience varies, but the community's proven friendly and helpful through many of my matches.  If you've ever been curious to try a 4x strategy game, and are prepared to sink in the time to learn, Endless Legend's distinguished high fantasy setting, easy to grasp mechanics, and variety of campaigns/playstyles will keep you engaged for a long while.   Easily worth it while on sale, still a good buy without, this'll eat up dozens of hours before you've experienced all it has to offer.",

It really brings the feeling of magical and unknown world around you. And music is insane. Seriously. One of the best soundtracks i ever heard.",

I started playing this game when I gifted a copy to friend. Playing with another person against the A.I and each other is enjoyable it gets you away from the very predictable A.I. playing solo.  Big thumbs up! on the artwork in this game. Every race or faction has their own individual feel to them, the attention to detail and the little nuances that each unit has is rarely seen in games period and this is a good one. The digital artists spent some time and the matte painting is superb.  The UI or user interface is fast, fluid and makes the game a joy to play. The UI has a modern feel to it and it really helps the player navigate through all the micomanagement that is needed in this game. In late game when you have a large empire you can easily manage your entire empire from just the dropdown city screen, fantastic.   The animation in the combat is also very good. The characters, heroes, and the units each have their own way to surprize you. The sound fx are very good and well timed.   The weapon assets are fantastic. I enjoy the difference between the Iron, Titanium, Adamantium and Palladium metal weapons. Each tier of metals weapons really change the way the units and heroes look and their animation in the combat system.  The combat system is actually also very good. There is a learning curve but once you understand that you do have full control over all of your units, you will have fun with this game.  The FIDSI or food, industry, science, influence is the heart of this game. This game is about diplomacy and empire management. Your descisions are critical on the outcome of your empire. Store some food for winter or you will starve.   The quests are plentiful and easy enough to accomplish. The grammer in the writing for the quests and the details about them need a little work, but they are other wise fun and they keep you exploring.   What I like best is the low-poly artwork for the units and for the map itself. The low-poly keeps the game low file size and fast moving. You have an option in the video options to change the quality to  'fantastic' Whoa I just figured this out today after 200 hours in game, man now I have to play more map looks great!  Overall this game is well balanced with managment and combat and one of the better turn-based games out for PC. I will continue to play this game in the future.

You have the usual supremacy/extermination/diplomacy victory conditions that you expect, but you also have access to some RPG elements. Each faction has a lore quest that leads to a victory. And along the way, you also have the opportunity to take on other lore based quests, and outfit your heroes and armies as you see fit.   The heroes are another interesting mechanic. Apart from leading your armies (think generals in Civ, or hero units in Warcraft III), they can also be assigned as governors to your cities, with a skill tree specific to governance.   The lore and worldbuilding is, in my opinion, some of the best in the fantasy genre I've seen in quite some time. Each faction is unique beyond their unit designs/builds, and each gives you specific goals to work toward.   THe only caveat - if you're coming from or prefer straight 4X games like Civ or Master of Orion, you may be put off by the focus on questing and lore.   Also - the devs are pretty great, with another upcoming faction expansion. Definitely a buy.",

The comparison to Civ5 is kind of obvious, but not really appropriate because the games deliver in different areas. My best suggestion would be to look at a few minutes of gameplay and see if it's the kind of thing you'd like.  Deterrents: - WAY too hard to learn. Expect to play for a while before you know what you're doing, or be willing to do some research. No campaign to explain the different races either. - Late game is lacking. Feels like a rush to the finish line rather than a maneuver, not helped by the lack of victory progress tracking for each of the empires. - Simultaneous turns means regions are snatched away by rival settlers the second before you press the button. Also, hotseat isn't supported. - The races, despite being so varied and interesting, don't behave all that differently from each other as rival empires. Missed opportunity for a lot of character.  Appeals: - Leveling your heroes is very satsifying and offers a wide range of benefits based on race and class, becoming true powerhouses in the mid game that can help immensely. - Quest system integrated into empire building rather well, rewarding you for exploring with currency and items for your heroes. Just don't be upset if you miss a few. - Well done asymmetric gameplay. While not all the races play radically differently, there are some that force a change in strategy, such as only having one city or not using food. - Tactical battles that let you try to eke out a win against a higher level foe or turn a close contest into a decisive victory. Racial units have some variety in here as well.",

Primarily this improvement comes from a much improved multiplayer system and a dynamic combat system which allows for interesting battles within a turn based multiplayer context. Each faction is very unique in how it plays and manages resources. Where the game is lacking is in the number of factions (there are 8 and 1 more in the DLC), also there is only three combat units to each faction not including hired minor faction troops. However the game allows you to create custom factions with their perk system, which can lead to some pretty broken factions if you try hard enough. In game units can be customized and new ones created. All of this adds to the game's replicability. A large amount of content is in the DLC, but the content that is offered in this DLC is well worth what you pay, but the game is excellent without it, if the money is too dear, although I would suggest getting the Emperor edition, as it is such good value. For me this game surpasses Civ in almost every element, and is the best 4X game I have played, well worth a try!!",

However, despite me saying it's Civilization 5-like, it is only similiar to the Civ games at the very base. This game is far more complex, with far more to do and to explore, and so on and on. But, even though it is not very similar to Civ 5, I still highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoyed those games, and hungered for something more demanding, as I had. This game, is prisitne. It is perfect. It is all I could possibly ask for in a game, and even though my profile says I've not put in a lot of hours into the game, I've probably put in several thousand offline hours. This game has a massive replayability factor, with completely randomly generated worlds, and many different ways for each faction to win the game. All the factions are very different from one another, and suit a different playstyle. However, they do not fit into a standard rock-paper-scissors format, as many other games do. Endless Legend excpects the player to work hard for victory, and it will push and shove you at every possible moment. This game is perfect.  Game with DLC review: Me and this games DLC have a love-hate relationship. Basically, some of the DLC are things that should either be in the base game, or free updates, such as the DLC that adds more minor faction missions. However, it does add even more to the game, with which I am always happpy. The Guardians and Shadows DLC are very good, and you should definetly get them. They add new units, quests, mechanics, music e.t.c, and the Shadows DLC even adds a new faction that is actually VERY fun to play as. Overall, if you have some cash to spend, I highly recommend getting all the DLC. In the long run, it makes the game a lot more fun.",

The learning curve on the game is a little steep, but it makes up for it with mind-meltingly beautiful graphics and immersive storylines. (The graphics used to represent each unit, building, anomaly, quest, etc., are fantastic and remiscient of 'Magic: The Gathering' cards.) The story of each leader and faction is fully fleshed-out with great attention to detail and care. Each faction is interesting and unique. There aren't as many factions to choose from as in traditional 4X's like Civilization that pull from actual history, but they make up for their lack of breadth in great depth. The gameplay is very engaging (in particular, the battle mechanics and army customization system are spectacular) from beginning to end with every victory type well-realized- even the traditionally 'boring' ones like diplomacy, science, and economy. (I know I keep comparing it to Civilization, but I can't help pointing it took Civ 5 TWO expansions to nail this point about making all the victories interesting.) This is clearly a game made with great care and enthusiasm by the game studio and I cannot commend them enough on the result. The effort shows. If you love 4X, BUY THIS GAME.

First, I do not agree with the behavior of some Chinese players that to give negative recommendations only for what happened recently (basically no Chinese translation any more). Honestly, this herd effect looks immature. In my view, the comments should give the reviews and advices to the potential customers. And, the customer will make his or her decision based on the information. By the way, that is the developers’ free choice to embrace the other language user or not.  Second, I want to talk to the teenagers may-be, with mother tongue of English, who show a weird prejudice against Chinese. ….. Well, I feel tired to continue… In sum, China is an ordinary place except some political issues and Chinese are ordinary people just like you, stupid or smart. If you want to look down on other countries, you should learn the language and go to the place to see with your own eyes. To the developers, thanks for the good work, feel sad for the choice. You should notice that the people here are all genuine game supporters. Unfortunately, the pirate player will not even notice this conflict. Hope you guys happy and enjoy this show. ",

            "review_text": "Endless Legend is an extremely fun and VERY addictive 4x turn-based stategy game, with RPG elements. The single player is great (the AI are a bit dumb though), but my favourite part, the multiplayer, is fantastic as well. Be warned though, multiplayer games take a SERIOUSLY long time, due to the combat system, and you will often be waiting for up to 5 minutes for your friend to finish a battle. The multiplayer savegames work pretty well though, there are very few desyncs and crashes. There are a lot less factions than, say, Civ but they are very much more different. For example, there is one faction who can never declare war, and another who can never be at peace. These features make every game unique and refreshing, as you need to use different srategies for each faction. The combat is lengthy but fun, it involves more tactical control than most other 4x games offer, and you can often tip bad odds in your favour with good positioning and tactics. Instead of unlocking new units, you level up your existing ones by equipping them with new gear, which is a great mechanic.  Overall, i give it a 9/10, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a break from Civ, or just fans of strategy games in general.",

However after finishing some games with different races I am really impressed by the game design, the numerous possibilities of play style and so on.  However the majority of winning conditions are not feasable to reach, the only way to win is a military approach - no matter of done by high-tech troops, huge armies or by diplomatic supremacy. Hopefully the racial quests and winning condtions will be adpated so that they are as viable as just sweeping enemies of the map.  Another backdraw are the frequent crashes I experience during play. Up to 5 time in 30 minutes is not uncommon, but due to auto safes there is no real loss in game progress. Unfortunately this makes multiplaying online impossible and unstable...

Having only played a single game focused on military I haven't done much with the diplomacy system or any of the other victory conditions so I can't say much about those.   What I can talk about is the combat. Endless Legend's combat is the best combat I've ever seen in any 4X game. You'll read a lot about how it doesn't work right or how it's weird or whatever. Those are simply complaints from people who don't understand the combat,  Throughout the game you can improve the weapons and armor of your faction, using the new things you create you can upgrade Heroes to focus on different stats and give them different traits to improve them or their squad, you can also upgrade your units which increases their cost but greatly increases their combat effectivness. By the end my main hero was able to almost solo entire armies with my other units winning 1v1 against every other unit.  Tactics are actually very important in battles in that you need to know what to put where and when and how the individual unit's abilities interact with each other. And there are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of abilities.   As I play more I might edit this review to include the other facets of the game, however the only reason I wrote this out is because it's almost 5AM and I'm finishing catching up on a show before sleeping.

The research system is intresting to me and when you create custom factions its gets even more indepth.

            "review_text": " The short of it:  If you like the Civilization games or the turn-based 4X genre in any way, Endless Legend is a sure buy. Same goes if you like Endless Space, but then, why are you reading this, you probably own Endless Legend already.   The long of it:  Endless Legend is a much-overlooked game in the 4X genre, and that's a damn shame. I suppose it's Amplitude's destiny to make great games that end up overshadowed by the established royalties in the genre (Galactic Civilizations for Endless Space, and Sid Meier's Civilization for this one), but don't let the smaller size of the franchise fool you. Endless Legend, like Endless Space, has the quality and the value to take on its bigger brother.  Since everyone will always compare every turn-based 4X game to Civilization and ask, 'is it better than Civ?', well, my personal answer is that the games are different enough for the question to be moot. Endless Legend is different from Civilization mostly in how its factions handle, how its resource system works, and, well, everything else really, making it a game that is somehow very comparable, and somehow very different.  Factions aren't just cosmetically different with a few unique traits and a unique unit or two, they actually play completely differently, and every faction has its own way of playing out its strengths and compensating for its weaknesses, so much that they all require a completely unique playstyle, and this makes Endless Legend infinitely replayable. The region-system prevents you from being overrun by Settler-rushes, and the combat is highly tactical, making a good tactician able to achieve victory against a tactically less able foe, even if that enemy does possess higher-tier weaponry or units. Endless Space players will be relieved that the needlessly complex and unpredictable card system has been ditched in favour of a more intuitive map-based combat system.  Heroes make up the backbone of your army, and you can customize them through level-ups, investing points in different abilities and equipping them with different weapons, armour and accessories (if you have the appropriate resource and tech, that is!). Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the game, with its army system, gets rid of the annoying 'no-stacking' rule, while simultaneously making it impossible to form deathstacks, something a certain other game in the genre was never able to do.  The minor factions appear to be roughly the game's equivalent to Barbarians, but when looking closely, you'll see they are anything but. They offer quests, can be bribed, or even pounded into submission in order to be assimilated into your empire and give you certain bonuses, as well as letting you construct their unique units. Speaking of quests, this feature is very important in Endless Legend. Gone are the days of Goodie Huts just leaving all kinds of treasure for the taking. You may get lucky and get a freebie, but in most cases, the game will let you work for it, giving you a set of conditions to fulfill (military, diplomatic, expansion-oriented and so on) before you can claim that reward.  Victory conditions are both of the mundane and classic variety, and also some special ones, like the Faction Quest every player gets, which consists of multiple stages, taking you through multiple eras. This, again, gives the game a lot of diversity in playstyles and keeps you on your toes - after all, that faction you consider lesser because of its low score might just be on the verge of completing its Faction Quest and snatching victory right from under your nose.  Graphics-wise, the game is very good-looking, with the world being so detailed and diverse you'll sometimes wish it was a bit less cluttered so you can see the tactical value of the land, but that's a tiny gripe. Another tiny gripe is the somewhat repetitive music, but we're living in an age of multi-tasking computers, even if that bothers you, just play your own music in the background.  So, to sum it all up, if you've been playing mostly Civilization games, Endless Legend takes a bit of adapting, and you'll need to get used to the FISDI system and the rest of the differences, but is it worth it? You bet your buns it is.",

However, what Civ 5 does have over Endless legend is the huge modding community and the fact that you don't have to worry about the game randomly crashing during multiplayer (which causes a lot of anger and lost time). Overal, I would promote Endless Legend as a 4x game that allows you to make more choices and differs enough in each new game so that you actually want to play as each faction and achieve all the different types of victory -- allowing for hours of fun to be had.",

I think after a few tries I never ever went ahead and fought battles manually, I prefer just spectating them fight, or autoresolve. The expand and exploit aspect of the game is really remarkable, you have to account for many many things when settling new cities, building new districts, deciding where to expand, what exactly to build, what to research, and it all is very well balanced ! You can decide to have a stronger overall empire, or just to focus on research for example, given the terrain supports it.  There are like 7 types of victory conditions, the one where you have to collect dust... a LOT of dust (dust is the ingame money) is somewhat hard... There are a lot of things to watch out for, if you wanna accomplish that, tho certain factions are bound to get different type of victory conditions easier. There are 8ish factions, they can be played in any way you see fit, tho given their traits, it would be easier to go for the pre-set victory conditions. Each of the factions represent an unique playstyle. I don't have the guardians dlc, as I don't see how it'd add much to my gameplay experience, it may be really good, but other than the guardians themselves, I don't see how the game against AI would improve. AI is nice tho, they don't behave unreasonably, there are reason to their actions, they are nice opponents. In multiplayer everyone seem to use custom created factions, and just go for the win with them, so I'll definetley play on servers, where these preset factions are not allowed. The game is fun, and due to the well generated maps, it feels fresh. I only played it for so much time, but I can see myself playing it more and more ! Recommended 7.5/10",

I think what strikes me most is the battle mechanic. Its a refreshing new take for a strategy game that truly is workable for TBS games. Rather than having a 100 unit 'stack of Doom' ala Civ II or being stuck with 1 unit per square ala Civ V - you can create armies of a limited size (that grows dependant on army leaders skill or tech) but still maintain a reasonable cap. The best part is the actual fight where it utilizes the area of the skirmish like a chess-board but incorperating the enviromental elements for each square. So now its vastly past the scale of one unit on grassland looking up at a foe on a hill, you now need to take into account several hex units out which adds a very rich level of battle that the TBS series sorely needs.

From the robust questing mechanics, to Amplitude’s unique take on city management and expansion, there are enough interesting and fresh mechanics here to intrigue even the most jaded 4X player and a lot more besides.  Highlights includes the combat system and unit manager, which improve heavily on the highly numeric ‘rock-paper-scissors’ feel of the Endless Space system, while retaining the detail-oriented feel. With control over unit equipment, passive abilities and even attack style, Legend offers a strategy-heavy, crunchy combat experience, where unit massing is rewarded, but not as much as having the right equipment to take down the specific foes you are fighting. The difference between frontline bruiser units and backline snipers or support mages is visceral, visual and satisfying, as are the battlefield system and reinforcement mechanics.   Quests feel important and motivated by discovery rather than by necessity. While some rewards are underwhelming, like the unique weapons and armors for Hero units, others are vital to good game progression. The ability to unlock research, acquire significant strategic resources, or new unit types make the questing process much more important to mid and late phase gameplay.   Cities also feel more responsive, with specialist-like production direction from the very first citizen and a growth mechanic that rewards different expansion styles in different ways. Need a manufactory? Expand to occupy as many hexes as possible. Need a scientific hub? Focus on building a tight cluster of a city with as many level 2 districts as possible. Automatic roads, no workers and tile exploitations make broader city management easier and less micromanagement focused, leaving you with the time and focus to plan expansions and manage larger armies.   The starting factions also provide a huge boost in replayability. The unique faction traits, as well as units and technologies, lend themselves to dramatically different playstyles. In contrast to more Civ-like games where strategy is determined more by game-level mechanics and your starting position, each Legend faction has obviously more viable strategies and approaches to the victory conditions. On the flip side, the factions don’t feel truly balanced. The differences in starting units alone bias the game early on before players have had an opportunity to research effective counter units. Some races are even locked out of whole aspects of the game. Necrophages can’t engage in diplomacy, the Broken Lords don’t interact with food and the Cultists can’t build cities. While major deficiencies are ostensibly balanced by other advantages, the lack of faction balance discourages diverse multiplayer, while simultaneously boosting single player variability.   While all the differences and new system mechanics can seem overwhelming, the key to Endless Legend’s success are the myriad little and big differences. It’s an extremely enjoyable foray into new spaces in the 4X genre. ",

            "review_text": "8 out of 10  Endless Legend is a turn based conquest strategy game similar to Civilization. If you played Endless Space, Endless Legend will feel like a long lost relative.  The developers tried to bring new ideas to the genre which are mostly ok. I appreciate the effort even if I am not sold on all the ideas.   The Good:  1. You can play very different games within the same environment. Aggressive, diplomatic, wealth or science generation.  2. You don't need to research all tech. Which allows for some interesting options.   The Bad:  3. The combat system. The developers tried to implement a system that allows for control. I just automated all the time. It is not really exciting.   The Ugly:  4. It takes way too long to achieve anything. Automation options are insufficient.   To be honest I liked Endless Legend more. Still a very decent game worth playing if you like the genre.",

Some are much easier to win with than others. - there are a lot of events that players can do to each other that have immediate impact that cannot be anticipated or countered. - the auto combat is rather random - it results in draws far too often, and can sometimes result in truly baffling losses. - the actual turn-by-turn manual combat doesn't really give you much strategic options - unless all of your units get to move first, any positiong you plan out will just wind up making your units stand there and look silly.  There is a substantial time investment to go through a match, and it shares a common weakness with other 4X titles: While the match lasts a long time, usually it's decided within the first 1/3rd of the playthrough, if not earlier. Much like the civilizations franchise, how your starting area is will decide the outcome of at least half the games, proximity to other players/AI will decide about half of what's left, and having some form of plan will decide the final piece of the pie.",

The factions are innovations in themselves, all with distinctly different mechanics that cause us as players to change strategy to succeed. Ultimately, planning to win from the outset is incredibly valuable. Whether you want to learn everything there is to know, complete the faction's distinct story line or blow everyone up as quickly as possible, as a strategist you don't want to waste time and resources building improvements and learning sciences that don't work toward that ultimate goal.

There are a lot of customization options available and the graphics are superb. I haven't played on a large map to know if there is slowdown, but my first 'tiny' 1vs1 match is proceeding along nicely. The UI and resources are remiscent of what you'd find if you played Endless Space. All in all, worth the $17.50 I paid.

I like 4X turn-based strategy games, and this game have everything what I want from this kind of games, every faction is different, and you need other strategy for everyone, map is divided by regions, where can be only one city, so you cannot spam cities like in civ. Battle system is not perfect, but still is OK.  In brief:    +      Graphic is beautiful   Music is even more beutifull (listen Skylark for example)   Good alternative for Civ   8 playable factions (10 with DLC)...   Every faction is different     -       Poor battle system   Sometimes I've got framedrops   I would buy this twice.",

Combat's awkward, though it's not so bad once you get used to it. I like the hero system, being able to upgrade your hero with armour, weapons and skill points. It's a beautiful looking game, and it's very easy to get so immersed time flies by while playing it. The AI is pretty simple, and pretty much poses no threat, so it's only worth playing multiplayer, if it was actually possible to complete a multiplayer game without going out of sync.

Asymetric factions make for interesting and varied gameplay, increasing replayability, and allowing for interesting interfaction gameplay.  The AI is... not that great.

I'm making him buy my glass-steel in exchange for the technlogies I am missing to become the best one at science again. Also, I secretely paid all the AIs to declare war on him and attack his cities feeding them technologies in exchange and playing the surprise each time my friend announces me someone started a war with him.  -Coming turn 225 he lost his main financial city and it looks very bad for whilst I am still *officially* allied to everyone. -Coming turn 250 and my friend got back into game because the AIs decided to fight each other instead of finishing the job. He founded his city again, he's making more money than I do because all my cities are diplomacy focused to ensure I can keep on pushing the AI to go to war and his armies are probably big enough to crush everyone else. -We're now at turn 260 my friend is planning his revenge on the AIs and especially the Drakens (diplomacy focused faction) because I convinced him they were the ones forcing the others to declare war on him because of their faction traits.  Luckily the winter is now very long (minimum 15 turns) and slowing him down and I'm giving technologies to the AIs for free in the hope they will get better armies to counter his armies.  I'm hoping we get to turn 300 (end of the game) before he gets his revenge and I can laugh at everyone's score dropping because of their wars whilst I'm getting all the science, dust and diplomacy points.

Endless Legend takes all the good bits of Civ, cuts away the extraneous, archaic crap and infuses it with bold new ideas and ingenuity to make a fresh, frankly superior, game. Your military units are content to occupy the same patch of land because, well, we aren't trogloytes here on Auriga. Every city you settle claims a whole region as your territoty, so no scumbag rivals insert themselves between your cities in an effort to screw with you. Nevertheless, you may want to think about making contact with the natives before sitting yourself in their back yard.  And the factions are unique. Utterly unique. They don't just have a unique unit or two and some different stat bonuses, they all have completely different playstlyes. As an example, the Roving Clans are a mercantile faction who can't declare war on anyone and get to move their cities around on giant beetles, whereas the Necrophages are evil bug dudes who can't engage in peace treaties and actually EAT their enemies to get food for their cities! Unit customisation, minor faction mechanics and the handling of quest objectives are all other brilliant ideas that work harmoniously to create a fun gameplay experience.  There are a few bugs with multiplayer still. My friend and I are often unable to reload saved multiplayer games thanks to some unusual desync issues. Despite this we've been trying to get games of Endless Legend in as often as we can.  If you can get past a little lack of polish (they've done remarkably well with so small a team), Endless Legend is a fantastic strategy game that breathes fresh air into an increasingly stale genre.

The game is visually stunning, and the music is great. Overall I feel like it just had fantastic direction, and with devs that enjoy working with the community, I couldn't be happier to give them money.  In the late game, my framerate does chug a little when zooming in from the map view to more detailed close-ups, in spite of having quite a powerful custom rig; It's a tiny bit annoying, but nothing deal-breaking.   Unfortunately, you may struggle to get it up and running for the first time if you're using a 64-bit Windows system. Personally, I had to switch the game to 32-bit compatibility to get it to run, but I don't think you can assume that the same would definitely work in every case. You might want to be prepared for the possibility that the game may not even run at all, or that it would take a long time troubleshooting before it does.

In games like Civ, if you colonise an area, some AI can come along and plant a city practically right next to yours, and there's nothing you can do about it but declare war and raze it. In Endless Legend each region can only have ONE city. So you build a city and get exclusive rights to all the resources of that area, nobody else can colonise it.  I can't express enough how that one change alone makes for a much more interesting game.",

            "review_text": "Gameplay  Each faction has its own units and bonuses which help diversify each game. For example the roving clan can’t declare war on any faction and can block others from the market.  The gameplay, with the exception of the combat, is well handled. Everything is clearly set up and easy to find, such as the market screen or the hero screen and the upgrade screen is very good as well so credit where credit is due. On the hole, I say that the combat is the weakest part of the game. When you enter a battle, say a broken lord’s army against an army of demons, the gameplay descends into setup you’re units pick if they hold positions, be defensive or aggressive then select start. Each battle has 6 phases after the sixth phase the battle ends and you return to the world map. All of this is fine, but were the game falls down is that apart from what has been stated above you control very little. It’s not the worsted I have seen, but the combat is very uninvolving and giving your orders in-between phases in a nightmare. For example say you want to pull a unit back because a better unit can take its place, well if that unit is attacked the order will not be followed. This makes coordinating your army mid battle very hard and it is very irritating when your best unit is killed because before they could pull back the enemy rudely attacked you before they could move and for some reason your unit decides to stay where it is and die.  Story  Each faction has its own story and quest, which I will not spoil, and each one gives the player reasons to explore and perform certain tasks. The timed quests are however really irritating. The problem is that the timed quests do not change or adapted in anyway. For example I got one quest were I had to complete by the end of the winter however I clicked next turn and winter had ended and I failed the quest. The developers do need to fix this because it is highly unfair to the player.  Graphics/Astatic   The graphics are okay, it’s the astatic and design that are really interesting. Each faction is very well designed and the weapons and armour looks brilliant. The landscape in the game is excellent and well-made and the animations are also well done. All and all the animations, Graphics and Astatic are very good and handled with care. ",

But sometimes things will make an order impossible, meaning the AI takes over. This can be extremely frustrating, since you can have archers run up to the front lines for no reason whatsoever. But generally speaking I got used to this pretty quicly. It just forces you to be much more conservative with your orders.   Big fun part is designing your units. But At least in my first couple games, I researched new tech so quickly that I spent probably a quarter of the entire game time trying to max-min my unit designs, only to have them obsolete in a few minutes.

This one is definitely no Civilization clone, it does lots of things very differently. Sometimes these changes are for the better, sometimes they don't work so well.  Combat is one of the clear missteps here. The turn-based combat sounds cool in theory but in practice it is extremely tedious and takes way too long. Auto resolve works most of the time, but will often waste units.  City management is interesting enough, but gets quite heavy on the micromanagement with larger empires. To get the full use out of your cities you need to spend a lot of time reassigning your population.  The game also makes heavy use of RPG elements. Both your heroes and regular units level up and you can equip them with weapons and armor. There's also a fairly in-depth quest system with a long and unique main quest line for each faction.  The Endless games have always had great lore and Endless Legend is no different. The art design and the aesthetic style are top notch too and way ahead of the competition. The UI design isn't quite as strong and sometimes critical information is quite hard to find. The game sorely needs an in-game help system, too.  Personally I would rank Endless Legend somewhere between Civ 4 (probably my favorite game of all time) and Civ 5 (pretty mediocre). On one hand the design is nowhere near as tight as Civ 4 and the balance often feels off. On the other hand Endless Legend does a decent job of introducing new mechanics to the genre without making the same design mistakes Civ 5 did.  The good: - Gorgeous map - Great universe and lore that is also shared with the other games in the Endless series - Unique factions - Lots of interesting quests - Lots of ways to win  The bad: - Game does not feel very balanced - Manual combat takes way too long and gets boring extremely fast, automatic combat works ok but can still waste units - Quite a bit of micro management - No LAN multiplayer  The ugly: - The game could really use an in-game equivalent of Civilopedia - Some quests can be (practically) impossible to complete",

The use of provinces keeps the micro-managing down and the tactical combat adds some more depth over the Endless Space fleet battles that used phases and orders. The city expansion mechanic with boroughs iadds some strategic decisions to where you found. The Winter/Summer mechanic is fun and requires you to plan ahead so you can keep the wheels of your empire and armies turning when the snow falls. Minor factions are also fun and can add unique units to your empire.  Each faction plays uniquely adding to replayability. The technology progression uses ages and required numbers of tech from the age to advance, it takes a little bit to get use to in my opinion but it beats Beyond Earths tech-web.

Everything from the way territory is controlled, how cities are built and how factions differ from one another is thought through and presented in an interesting way. (Although Civ 6 has taken a hint and is using a similar city expansion mechanic).  Two of the most interesting aspects of the game are the summer/winter cyce and the aforementioned faction differences. In Endless Legend, the map sometimes shifts from summer to winter, which makes things generally more difficult to survive in for all in the game. The winters are longer and come more frequentlyas the game progresses, showing the planet's slow decline into inhospitability which the game is set against. It's a good way of getting the player to hurry up and plan out how they will advance, since there's a ticking time bomb in the weather.   As for the faction differences, unlike some games, the differences between the factions are rather dramatic, and seriously affect your playstyle. One race cannot research technology properly and so has to steal it from other players, one literally changes form and function depending on the seasons, one can never be at peace and needs to eat living prey (ie enemies) to make up for their bad farming and grow, one faction will only ever have one sprawling megacity but can corrupt the minor factions around the map to work for them and supply troops and resources. That's only a few of them. Amplitude put a lot of care and attention into making every group both visually and functionally unique.  The expansions are fantastic too, each adds something that spices up the game, usually a faction and a mechanic that said faction uses a lot. For example: Shadows included the new espionage system and The Forgotten faction (who need to steal research), whilst Guardians gave all factions access to massive Guardian units, and expanded on the in game quests system to include shared quests and races to complete certain objectives for rewards.",

Still valid old review:  Very Much Like Civ 5 only dare I say better in certain ways with a steeper learning curve because of its various customization options with regards to battles, etc. Whether thats a pro or a con is up to you to decide. I put in about 500hrs offline and only about 60hrs for Civ5 so I I can't really tell you which one is better only that EL appealed to me more I suppose even though I do intend to play some more Civ5 eventually.. as I always tell myself (still pending) o.O'  BATTLE MECHANICS:  There are those who say the battle system is lacking but i really disagree, I think its safe to say those who claim this have never played endless or even immposible diffulty and thought they were probably better off auto-attacking. The difference between auto attack and smart manual play can range from minimal difference to very dramatic in the hands of a skilled player. So while I could say auto-attacking could use a little improvement, it should never replace manual. SO yeah battle mechanics: always room for improvement but pretty solid overall.  AI: I really think they're not half as bad as people giving it negative reviews claim. Sure they aren't the smartest bunch but they're not completely incopetent either. I guess they make up for this by giving them boost ranging from a little to dramatic (difficulty dependant) in the early game making them pretty OP in harder difficulties. I think they're real weakness lies in them being AI and that can be exploited with diplomacy and the like in this game as I'd imagine other games of this genre. But there is a limit to how smart ai can possibly be for a game so complex as this id imagine so you wont hear me complaining. Sure theres always room for improvement but im fine with it. And if it really bothers you, simple solution is to play multiplayer :p   Thats it excuse me if my review is messy (prob fix later) (updated a bit still havn't) but w/e read or not, just thought I'd share. xD",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: This game is great. Get it.  Endless Legend is a turn based strategy game that takes the best elements of classic series such as Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization, and combines them to create a product that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The core of the game is to build your empire as one of several extremely unique factions. There are the Broken Lords, beings that inhabit suits of armor and subsist entirely on Dust, the game's equivalent of gold, bypassing the need for food entirely. Or there are the Necrophages, a sentient insect race that devour everything in their path, including their own citizens if they desire. There is a faction that controls the world markets and cannot declare war, and a faction that values diplomacy and can force peace treaties and alliances. These are just a sample of the factions, and each one brings with it an entirely unique strategy.  Much like the Civilization series, players have an option for how they would like to pursue victory. In addition to staples like Domination or Scientific victories, there are also more unique victory methods such as the Expansion victory where the goal is to control over 70% of the territories on the map. There is even a storyline victory, in which players can race to unlock the secrets of their faction and the world of Auriga as a whole.  Developing territory in this game is incredibly satisfying as well. Each region in the game can only be occupied by one city, and the owner of that city becomes the owner of that territory, thereby gaining control of any resources that territory may hold. Developing cities is much more interesting than just building a bunch of buildings as well. Players can expand the amount of tiles their city exploits by actually building expansion districts that visibly increase the size of their city, in addition to providing increased resource generation.  Combat is a unique affair where both sides battle for six turns. Units and generals can be outfitted with an assortment of different gear types that affect everything from their damge and defense, to providing unique abilities such as retaliating against everything around the unit. The battles play out automatically with some strategical assistance from the player. If the battles aren't decided within the six turns, they are considered a draw.  One the biggest hurdles to overcome when playing Endless Legend is the UI. While extremely informative and clean, it provides a lot of information that can be daunting to newer players. My recommendation is to take time to complete the tutorials provided in game, as they cover all of the basics and really help familiarize players with the UI as well.  If you enjoy 4x and turn based strategy games, you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. The base game is a great price, and frequently goes on sale, and the expansions only serve to improve the experience.",

The one negative is the random combat, its not always clear what units will do given an order or how they will move accross the map.   The greatest thing in the game is the rich story and flavour of each different faction, all of which play completely differently.

It would have been great to get smarter AI as opposed to super cheating AI.  2. The combat could be significantly improved. I would have preferred something closer to Age of Wonders 3. I think that would have made this game much more interesting combat wise, especially with how stupid the AI is.   Besides these two gripes that I have, the game is amazing. The difference races all feel different and have different strategies. The map and empire building aspects are really well done.

If you haven't played something like this before or you have played a ton of Civ, start out on easy and learn the mechanics first. Read a couple of guides on beginning build orders. From there, start trying to beat the game with different races in different ways. It is distinctly challenging.  The game is absolutely gorgeous on my Core i5 3000 series and AMD 7850 with 2GB. It supports 2560x1080 without issue.  Recently, I added a few of the DLC and I think they definitely add something to the game. I added them one at a time to get a feel for the changes, but I do not believe it would have mattered if I had added them all simultaneously.  If you see this title on sale in a $20-25 bundle, absolutely pick it up. At a minimum, pick up the base game and give it a fair shot -- the DLC can always be added later. Excellent title.

The game is gorgeous, the audio is nice, the lore is engaging, the UI is *mostly* efficient and intuitive but ultimately the mechanics feel awkward and grossly unintuitive. I feel that many changes were introduced into the typical 4x formula more out of a desire for novelty than genuine improvement over tried-and-true systems. It's not praise when I state that every time I put this game aside for a month or two and come back to it that I am nearly at a complete loss as to how to play/enjoy the damned thing.  Part of the allure of a strategy game is in untangling its mass of interconnected parts and learning a new series of mechanics and how they affect each other and the overall thrust of the game but I feel that the awkward learning curve of Endless Legend lacks the payoff in gameplay that makes the effort feel worthwhile. Most of the mechanics revolve around maximizing an endless pile of tiny modifiers that work invisibly most of the time and don't really contribute to an impression of growing an empire. The spreadsheet-y nature of 4x games is just too front-and-center for this one and in board game terms, I feel like I'm playing a euro-style abstract victory-point chase rather than a more viceral, thematic war game.   I am not baffled by the popularity of this game and can see how it would be very appealling with gamers of a different stripe than myself but for me, the only reason that I keep coming back to the game and giving it another go is that I am chasing after the same enjoyment (and failing to find it).",

Pros:  -An amazing world with lots of unique minor/major factions, creatures, improvements, technology and terrain  -Nice graphics, the game just looks really nice. The world art has a 'Game of Thrones' feel to it.. and it isn't over done. Seems to fit well and looks great.  Cons:  -Pacing. The game is incredibly slow. I have started a few games and other factions pretty much never attack. On top of that it is difficult to ramp up your economy to field an army. I found my self restarting or quiting games because my one and only Army would get wiped out by neutrals (which are very aggressive).   -Unit Variety. Each faction gets 3 units. Sure you can create and upgrade units but they all look the same and only vary slightly. Compare this to the unit creation in Fallen Enchantress (for example) where you can make virtually any unit you wanted AND change the colors of their clothing. Also there only seems to be 'damage' not broken down to different types (fire, shock, cold, etc).... in fact the entire unit creation seemed very tacked on and shallow.  -Bugs. Lots and lots and lots of crashing. Especially after about 30 turns or so. The long a game is the more frequent crashes occur.  In conclusion the game has an amazing world and some good art direction but the game play is fairly pedestrian. The AI seems weak and bland, with aggressive factions just wondering around (seriously even the corspe-eaters didn't attack). The more I played the more I found myself just playing to see how I could build up a city or exploit a resource... or just explore the world while my neighbors just flounder around.

Examples would be the terribly implemented combat, where you assign orders before the turn. This is stupid as when the AI moves before you (different units act faster than others), all your strategy becomes pointless. Its a sort of 'guess what the opponent will do' mechanic similar to endless space, but a lot more frustrating.  Then there is the occupy-a-region mechanic. On paper it sounds good, but there are times where it will annoy you to no end. This game requires large investments for a city to make a settler, and if you are one turn away from placing your settler on your chosen spot ant then bam an opponent has settled the opposite end of the region and all your effort is up in smoke. There is also an impression that this game was released once all the features were ticked off as complete and bug free (which tbf they are), but that the devs skipped over the polish stage. At the end of combat all units still waiting to move have co 'cycle' a do-nothing action. When building a settler all population you assign to food have to be moved out (you cannot produce food when building a settler) and then back on completion, manually. And so on. In short, this is a very well made game, but just isnt for me. However it is extremely deep and different to most of the genre (especially civ), so if you are looking for that go ahead.",

Its very polished, looks great, the menus are intuitive, and its easy to get an understanding of what your empire is doing in a quick look.  However, this game bored the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of me.  My biggest problem was the combat. I read reviews and from what I understood, combat was going to be like Age of Wonders 3. And while they share similarities, Endless Legend dumbed it down big time. In this game, you don't individually move your units and attack. Instead, you give a very, VERY general set of instructions. You tell a unit to attack an enemy, no matter if the unit can reach the enemy or not, and thats it. Your unit does its best to get within range and attacks if able. Automatically. There is no tactics, no skill. Its purely who has the most units, who has the smartest units, and who has the best equiped units.  No special powers, no tactical positioning to flank an enemy cause there is no bonus for such things. You can't select one unit, move it out of the way so another unit can move to its spot and attack. You can't even really tell your unit where to go in most cases. While it is true that you can tell your unit to move to a specific place next to an enemy and attack, if that enemy moves before that unit, the unit isn't going to do anything except move because now the enemy isn't where you told your unit to move.  Combat in this game has been dumbed down to 'Everyone attack this one guy! And if he dies, then attack whatever guy you feel like! But be sure to trip over yourselves trying to get within fighting range!' You make sure the red lines are all pointing towards one guy, hit play, and watch your units try their little hearts out to attack whatever the red line pointed at.  My next issue is equiping and upgrading your units (I.E. the RPG aspect of this game)  First, I have an issue with having only one infantry, archer/support, and calvery unit per race. In order to get more units, you have to convince a minor faction (Either by destroying their village in your region then rebuilding it, bribing them, or completing a quest for them) to be assimilated into your faction. Then you get their one unit. Which I must admit, was pretty lame to me. I like to have multiple units with different abilities so being restricted to less than a hands count sucked.  I was fully expecting to find magical gear like powered up swords or armor and having to choose which units or heroes to give it to. Instead Endless Legend makes you choose between having your one racial infantry unit hold a sword or spear (Doing extra damage to infantry or calvary respectively) and just getting the next 'Tier' of armor your technology level allows.  I will admit, I liked being able to upgrade or 'Retrofit' as the game calls it my units after adding my newly researched better armor to them immediately. But again, the upgrade itself is nothing more than equiping the next level of equipment rather than making any real choice as to how to upgrade them.  The heroes was something I liked however. Your heroes have a skill tree with 3 different trees with abilities that can affect them if they are the general of an army or the mayor of a town. Or both in some cases. It did make you have to choose if you wanted a powerful unit or to give a city huge bonuses.  The city building was interesting. Its a mix between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic 6 I believe. Maybe 5. I don't remember. But you build a city anywhere you want in a region, which are randomly cut out areas on the map. But you can only have one city per region so once you build a city, that region is considered yours. Along with everything in it. So enemy players can't build a city directly next to your land and take it via influence like in Civilization.  I'm not a real fan of the thumbs up or down method steam uses to rate games because this game itself isn't bad. It was just incredibly boring to me which is why I cannot recommend it.",

            "review_text": "For those on the fence:  --I would not recommend this game unless you are new to a 4X title or are a fan of Endless Space. What follows is a critical review of a game I honestly wanted to enjoy (ergo, I bought it).  This game is not one of tactical battles, but of empire-building. It most closely resembles Civ5, but with a few minor differences:  +This game allows you to equip commander/governors and further shape your empire's bonuses. +It also has you building small armies of units, vice each being its own hex.  -On the downside, combat is resolved in a horrible fashion, with only initial choices being made as to where to place your units, what 'stance' they should take, and then who they should attack (if able). There is rarely any reason to not just attack one enemy at time, and you are largely a spectator once combat begins. Not being able to issue 'true' move commands during a battle greatly hampers the experience and actually yields a system that is even less engaging than Civ5 (a game that is combat-lite to begin with). This is not a Gettysburg simulation, so abstraction in orders does not fit and simply comes off as over-simplification.  -UI is somewhat cumbersome, with right-clicks backing you out of menus at times and other times expanding information. Getting heroes transferred between governor and commander requires creating and army, then shifting the hero the university, then shifting them to the army. Should have been one button (maybe I missed something). Other items are similarly hidden and I would recommend YouTubing Tokshen's channel to see a decent LP of it first to get a handle on things. -You have to research diplomatic processes such as parley and bribe, as if they were tech rather than natural extensions of logic. -There are only two seasons: Winter and Summer. Would be interesting if expanded on, but just results in shifting population around to make the most of it. Lack of a Spring or Fall makes it seem random and gamey. -Artificial time mechanics. I hate 'timers' in games, and this one has the seasonal, the Empire planning (every 30 turns), and technology tiers instead of trees. Ended up clicking through many turns to heal units, pass the winter, or wait for unneccessary techs to complete to get what I really needed.  -No world-map or commander skills to use to change things up. Most 'fantasy' stylings have magic or leader skills, this one has nothing. Ends up feeling stale and predictable.  On the bright side: +No crashes during play. +Multiplayer was smooth with no issues connecting over Steam via invites. +Simultaneous turns means less down-time waiting for the CPU to process its moves in between and a quicker game overall. +The game is aesthetically pleasing (looks sharp) and resources 'pop' out when you can utilize them, but blend in well when not available.  +Races play quite differently in the sense of what is available and when (Drakken have diplomacy, Flyers have tech, etc), as well as how resources are utilized. Again, most of this happens on the strategic level, but is well themed.  Overall, this game doesn't do anything new and that which it does, has been done better elsewhere. If you must have a fantasy variant, I would recommend Dominions 4, Eador, or Age of Wonders instead (in that order). If you already own those and just want something new, go ahead and give it a try. Similar to Endless Space, it seems these devs don't know how to do combat, just focusing on trying to reinvent the wheels of research and expansion without truly improving them.

The game has a complexity that walks the line between fun and tedious. It feels like a job after a while: it's repetitive and the exciting moments are too few. The matches take too long and so little things are happening. Most of the time you will spend micromanaging little things and pressing next turn. The Quest system is nice at the beggining but repetitive and boring: just move your units to a place or spend X ammount of resources. The science system is good but they won't give you anything unique, a lot of copy-paste techs. There is little diversity between each game.  Overall is not a bad game but it didn't win me over.",

Now the bad and it is a show stopper. The tactical combat is really poor, visualise playing chess on a 4x4 board. So many of these 4x games have a decent strategic game and then rubbish tactical combat. Its great to have many units with different ranges speeds and special powers but if it all takes place on a tiny map where the opposite sides can reach each other on the first turn and cant move out of range there are not any tactics at all. In summary it looks nice but combat is so boring I have lost interest in the rest of the game, shame.",

            "review_text": "I know this game is well-regarded and I purchased it based on high user and critical reviews, but I'm fairly disappointed. A lot of aspects of this simulation are very good - it's not that it doesn't have redeeming qualities. It is, however, a buggy game that confuses pedantry for detail. In particular, the combat system is very, very poor and onerous. Most of the time you'll simply speed up the animation and put it on auto. For a game often touted as a grown up version of Civilzation V, I expected a lot more.   Maybe it gets better if you spend hundreds of hours playing it. I don't think that it's worth it, for that kind of time investment you could be playing EUIV or CK2, and if you did want to keep your job and family you could just play Civilization V instead. The combat and unit placing make little to no sense - for example, you can be in a relatively open area next to an ocean, and if you approach an opponent from a certain tile, only two of his eight units will appear. Since the combat has a hilariously arbitrary 6 turn limit before both sides shake hands and decide to break for tea, this can be an issue if you need to destroy an army racing somewhere important (usually either trying to take a city or trying to escape). You'll often see this happen with minor factions that have 3 or more units built up. You'll get a lonely giant, rather than 3 buddies, and you'll just kill them over 3 times.   The unit 'design' system is well intended but often bogs you down. Part of the problem is that when you want to variations of a unit, you can't amalgamate the design at a later date. You might end up with an army with, say, 8 identical units, but they require you to make three different designs for the same unit. For example, if you slap on an accessory that gives your infantry disease immunity because you're fighting bugs on one side of the map, when you bring those anti-bug units over you can't just have them pick up the next infantry upgrade the rest of your army is using.  The tech/city-sim aspect of the game is neat. All and all this has to be the most wildly overrated game on Steam, in part a reflection of the strong desire for a more combat heavy / fiction version of Civilization (which Beyond Earth failed to provide, and I suppose one can say that Endless Legend is at the very least better than Beyond Earth).  I have to say the combat in this game is a flaming train wreck, however. As simplistic as it is in Civilization, it's more sensical and building an army doesn't feel like an awful chore. If you're really into sims, then you'll probably like Endless Legend. Otherwise, stick to Civilization V, and again, if you really want something meaty and time consuming, the Paradox fare is more appetizing.",

            "review_text": "Don't believe the hype: this is a fairly terrible entry in the 4x genre. The developers have provided a single innovation: a new way to provide bonuses for the AI. This 'innovation' prevents the player from fully controlling his units during a battle, which leads to incredibly sub-optimal unit maneuvers. Attack orders are issued at the beginning of each round for all units, so if your unit's target dies during the round, the unit will choose its own battle plan, which is invariably awful. Rather than attack a nearby unit, yours will pick an absurdly distant one and have to walk around the absurdly common obstructions that litter every battlefield. This phenomenon is most noticeable and insufferable when playing a faction with slow moving 3rd tier infantry against an AI faction with flyers: the opposing flyers will isntantly relocate next to your squishies while your titanic morons ping pong across the battlefield.  As for the 'changing world' that everyone keeps talking about: you will experience the occassional winter, which slows movement and all types of production. Yeah....uh...amazing...or something.   For a fantasy 4x, this game is terribly light on magic, which is disappointing since magic typically provides the tactical variations in these games. Any 'spells' your units have are little more than auto-attack or auto-defend animations.  Your roster of troops is limited to 3 units plus various mercenaries. The units you do have are typically uninteresting with little in the way of tactical options. Attack or defend, that's it. Oh, the choices!  Perhaps this developer will soon make an audacious foray into another genre by providing us 'Endless' tic tac toe bereft of the Xes.",

The different factions have motivations that are totally opaque in terms of gameply and diplomacy during each game. This is terrible for a strategy game, as it's thus virtually impossible to predict the AI's future moves/plans unless the player has spent a considerable amount of time learning each faction's strengths and weaknesses.   It's also the same story, gameplay, and strategy for each faction for every game, regardless of changes to geography and climate. For example if you play as the vaulters you will do best if you min/max science and industry and turtle your cities. And that's the same.... every game.

The turns themselves are interminable. The AIs sit and think for so long that you will probably find yourself spending the majority of your time just waiting for the end of turn calculations.

This takes time and there's no way the other opponents on the map are able to get the special buildings when you have to take into account that the Winters also deplete you of gold and you have shift resources or you will go bankrupt.

I actually found myself becoming more disinterested with the game the longer the tutorial went.   All in all, it looked interesting, but i'd sooner eat my own liver than willingly recommend this game to just anyone. If you have patience, sure give it a try. Personally, the gameplay is too slow and there's far too much information and too little explanation. This game is something id play randomly and only when utterly bored already.  If you're interested, i sincerely suggest you wait until its on a discount sale.",

What does that mean you ask? The interface is not bad. The graphics are decent. The game design isn't incompetent. I appreciate a game release that seems finished. But... Gameplay is too slow. Units are too bland. There is a silly rule in both endless games that your population gets unhappy with expansion and it will cripple your empire. Sure, there are (eventually) techs that mitigate this, but that too takes time. That is one of the core gameplay rules and IMO it completely detracts from gameplay. Also the combat is only vaguely strategic.  ",

Other wise I would expect to have read many other reviews like mine prior to purchasing.  The game often becomes unresponsive. This can happen when I'm navigating through menus, mid battle, or in movement mode. When it happens the game will take no input. The animations and sound are still playing but I'm unable to exit menus, move units or make commands in battle. The only thing I can do is force quit the app. This is very frustrating and stops me from wanting to play further.  Having said that the game itself is very enjoyable when its working as intended. I don't think what I'm experiencing is wide spread especially for PC users. I say this because it happens so frequently for me that if it was the same for everyone else the reviews would be littered with bad recommendations.  I'm still going to have to give this a bad review based on my experience. Any mac users out there be wary of purchasing this game.  EDIT  I've put another 10 hours in to it and I'm still finding more bugs. Attacking or defending costal cities/villages is buggy. One time the game straight up crashed with a null object reference. Makes me think that the game doesn't handle switching game states very well. I once had the game crash after placing my first city...  Another pet peeve is the AI. I can never trust the auto battle resolution. It will make the worst decisions and end up costing you troops. The AI will some times just stand in one place while my troops rain arrows down on them.   So disappointed in this game wish I could get my money back.",

You deploy your units and choose their targets, and then each unit acts according to its initiative. This is more realistic than a normal turn-based system, but it's slow and boring to the point where I just walk away from my PC while the turn plays out. There didn't seem to be any option for basic strategy like telling your melee units to wait until your archers soften up the enemy before charging them.  - Text is not smoothed (apparently the graphics filtering is being applied to it, making it blurry).

The goal of the game is to reach one of the 8 winning conditions. so to get to the point quickly ill number them as i do always on my reviews into NEGATIVE, POSITIVES and SUGGESTIONS for the DEVELOPERS. IILL BE COMPARING THIS GAME WHIT CIV.BEYOND EARTH(C:BE) as it was the game that draw me to the genre.  -NEGATIVE-  -Very poor job to explain the game to a rookie,very lackluster introduction to the game.has no library to search info on your questions like in C:BE.which is where the majority of my problems go.  -You cant control where you trade, cant raid on trade routes and to me that a very important part of a strategy game simulating warfare.  -I dont even know on what is the world score based on so i have to clue how to keep going my score up.  -Huge world whit lots of sea and there arent any naval Units, only to travel the land units turn into ships.  -The game is veryyyy super sloww i find it even slower than C:BE, it takes forever to build things even on the fast setting.  -They dont explain the 8 victory conditions or how to reach them(Unlike C:BE). so i dont know what to plan for.  -The factions are not balanced, of the 4 game i played the Broken lords,Roving clans and Necrophage tend to be at the top of the score.  -Factions only have 3 'unique' units each whit special abilitys that really arent that special since the unit activates whenever they want and not when I want.  -The units types makes no diference beacuse they are not good at their role except for the Archer unit which is overpowered to the extreme basically you can win the game whit only archer units and can even kill the anti archer unit cavalry whit ease.  -Hate the Eras leveling up system, you have 6 eras and in order to age to the next one you have to research 9 discoverys from the previous one in order to get to the next one. each of those discoverys have very long turns numbers this is another thing that makes the game slow as ♥♥♥♥.  -This is the part i most hate, there a whole lot of discoverys(techs) whit long turn times which i may mention there are about 65-80 techs of them. This is what makes the game so slow you research it and after you do the research you have to research them individually on each city in order to work. take a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of time and makes it tedious.  -You dont expand your territory like in C:BE you have regions when you build a city in that region the whole regions is yours. personally is a cool feature but makes the game stale.  - Another thing that make the game slow,You have to upgrade your units MANUALLY EACH of the units whit the available era equipment, and this is where it pisses me off, if you have a units that is already building named MARINE1 and you upgraded him to MARINE2 the being build unit stays the same MARINE1, you have to delete him and put a MARINE2 or upgrade him on the field.  +POSITIVE+  +Each of the 8 factions are very different from each other for example ill note the most originals, Broken Lord( Noble knights vampiric spirits in armor) Cultist of Eternal End (Robotic Manequins Zealots) Necrophages (Medieval Zombie Insectoids) Also worth to mention the Drakken (Wise diplomatic dragonic sages). also the art style they use is wonderfull and very just beautiful is like art that moves when the leader of other faction speak to you.  +LOVE the lore and story and the feel of the factions. and the Minor factions idea is just great which is about twice the number of the major factions they act like the neutral bugs of C;BE but they can be assimilated into your empire but you only can have about 3 serving yoru empire so chose carefully.   +Love how they turned clasical and overdone fantasy races into something fresh or scary ♥♥♥ monsters into just people who live on the planet like the Drakken.But to me the best example are the Orcs in other games they are warring strong people, here they are a minor faction of hunter scavengers whit big bows.  +KILLER soundtrack from choirs to angel like voices and very melodic tunes that calm your soul. this is the mostly reason i keep playing it.  +I think the diplomacy system is better than C:BE  +like how they update the game whit some new minor factions from time to time and the cheap price they put on the small DLC guardians.   SUGGESTIONS DEVELOPERS.   &gt;The discovery systems makes the game to slow and tedius, make half of them for example Public Sewers or City Def. upgrades UNIVERSAL and the one you have to again build in your region would be extractors,towers or borought would be REGIONAL.you cut that and the era System it self will be shorter.  &gt;Naval Units need to be there, there a huge world whit powerfull empires whit sea and archipielagos but no navy?? makes no sense at all.  &gt;Better introduction into the game or and easy to use library ingame for the gamers in order to check on stuff and not have to close the window in order to look for the manual on steam.  &gt;The unit types are not working they are useless after all whit only archers you can win, its very broken system.  &gt;A ingame chart that tell how much world points you have and in which areas like in the end game.

Another example is that the fight will not finish untill all the unit try to act, even if there's no enemies in the field. Maybe software engineers will understand it better, the designer just check the condition of win after a whole turn to simplify the implementation!  There're so many other details make me creasy!

But mainly leaving this review here to warn people in case, like I did when I purchased, they think they're encouraging one of the darlings of the Indie world... that time is sadly over.",

            "review_text": "Complete review, as always, found on blog @ amenglishDOTweeblyDOTcom/endless-legend   This is a perfect game to showcase how pathetic the 'yes vs no' recommend system is- that and 'Banished' and 'PoE' and 'Banner Saga' and... Why?  At $40, $50, or even $50+ this game is grossly, GROOOOOOSSSSSLLLLY overpriced. If this game was free and/or you early access supported this game (or ones like it) for $15 and got a free copy of the game would you say your $15 was well spent? Hell yes.   The problem? More and more and more games are going early access + kickstarter route and what this means is that many people will be getting a game that sells for $50+ at retail and they will get it for less than half that price. What this creates is a large, sometimes unbearably large group of 'day one players' who basically are playing a game that cost them next to nothing (Sometimes as little as $5). So what do they expect when playing the game? I suppose at $5 you expect the game to start and allows you to actually play, and that is about it- so anything else you basically splat in your pants.   Is Endless Legend bad? No... Is Endless Legend worth more than $20? Hell to the no... HELLLLLL NOOOO!  In a genre as super saturated as the 4x is, in fact next to FPS and 'RPG's' the 4x genre might be the largest, this is not a genre that you have to 'dig deep' to find 4x games that are amazing and that are half the price or even a quarter of the price. On a price entry point alone this game is terrible, let alone if this is your first 4x game. However, if you have played EVERY SINGLE 4x game out there and LOVE them all, get this game on sale ($20) and you shouldn't be too dissapointed.   If this is your first 4x game purchase let me STRONGLY recommend you turn around and walk away. Why? This is the type of 4x game that will require those familiar with 4x games about 10-30 hours of gameplay before they even get a strong grasp of everything in the game- for those new to the genre this game will most likely make you swear a blood oath never to purchase another 4x game again- which is unfair to a very fun genre.  If you are new to the genre may I suggest two games, Civilization Revolution and Age of Wonders. Both are great entry points, both are amazing as far as price, but one is more for people who like 'realistic worlds' (Civilization) and the other is more 'fantasy/RPG' (Age of Wonders).   If you are still interested in buying this game here is a small section of my complete review that sums up who would actually like this game:  By “having hours and hours to learn the game” I really mean at least 25 hours to even grasp what is going on. You will play the HORRIBLE tutorial and come out of it with your eyes swollen, it will be like drinking from a fire hydrant, and then you go play the game on normal and get torn to pieces- even if you are familiar with 4x games. 10+ hours later you try your next play through, you know more now but you still damper back the difficulty and decide to only do auto-battles this go around. If you are lucky this time you will figure out that there really isn’t 10 different ways to win the game, there is only one way to win the game- exploiting the AI and attacking the entire game. You want to play this game like any other 4x game- build wide or build tall- you will eventually get overwhelmed every time by an enemy army that is all lv 10 across the board. You see, attacking non-stop you build an army of lv 5-10+ troops which by the end of the game will and can destroy 60+ enemy units without taking a single point of damage and the same time the AI will not invade and attack your unguarded cities if you are in their lands attacking them. So what you do is decide to play again with this tactic in mind and play on normal; you absolutely destroy the game and it is so ridiculously easy you wonder if you just didn’t understand the game before. So you play again on normal but change tactics, maybe even factions (the dragons and dust knights are both ridiculously easy) and watch once again as you get destroyed. So at this point in time you have plugged in close to 50 hours of game play and you finally understand the game, but how much fun is it? Each and every play through from this point on (even on harder difficulties) will be exactly the same, even the same quests, and you will really only be able to play with one playstyle as the others will just lose out every, single, time. So bottom line in this regard is that if you don’t like aggressive playstyle (it is 500x easier to just take over an enemy city than it is to build a settler and build your own city) and don’t have hours upon hours to actually understand the game, even if you love 4x games this game will not be enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "It just isn't very interesting and extremely confusing. It even crashed in the middle of the tutorial, which I still haven't passed because I don't understand whatever it wants me to learn. The GUI seems plain and uninteresting.   I thought it might be somewhat like Heroes of Might and Magic or something, but it just seems too much trouble to even get into. Maybe I will try again later. Tried returning it, but it wouldn't allow it.",
