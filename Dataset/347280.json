            "review_text": "  Love the graphical look of the game!  Love the atmosphere!  Love the music!  I'm not the greatest shmup player, but the difficulty presented here by the fast respawn rate of the enemies and their swarming tendencies is something I can get behind. It's hard for me, but it's an enjoyable chaos. To a better player the dificulty should bring a lot of joy, especially if played co-op with a friend,  If you're a fan of shmups and you like a challenge then you should give this game a try. If you tend to quit after you get swarmed and devoured on the first levels, then this is not the game for you.",
