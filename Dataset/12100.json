            "review_text": "In 2001, I was a junior in high school, and as one, was completely blown away by GTA III. The music, the size of the game, the overall gloomy rainy atmosphere - it was right up my alley. And now, 15 years later, I look back and realized that nothing has changed and that this game still remains one of my favorites. I think it's safe to say that it influenced my life quite a lot - I learned to drive while playing it; I was learning English at the time and the game helped a lot; my music tastes were influenced by the radio stations. And when I was feeling blue, like I did a lot when in high school, I could escape in this approximation of the reality across the ocean.   Sure, these days with newer games like GTA IV and V, the graphics are better, the plot is more twisted, guns are more abundant and the music is newer/different. I do like the newer games as well, so can't say they are worse than GTA III. But this one is the one that started the 3D Grand Theft Auto Experience, just like Black Sabbath started heavy metal.   So, I'm not sure that what I wrote here qualifies as a review, because I like everything, but here it is.",

Now, i am sure that everybody are familiar with concept of GTA games, so i will cut to the chase.  It was the first game in the series to use a 3D engine. The game itself was based in a fictional place called Liberty City, which supposedly resembles New York. Thanks to the engine, the city is dynamic, having a 24 hour day cycle and weather changes.

            "review_text": "Recommended - with caveats.  Controls: A major hurdle. For a while I was prepared to give in and call the system broken. After working through it, I eventually began to find a work around. I spent most of the game using a 360 controller because, as the title implies, much of the game is spent inside vehicles and the mouse/keyboard vehicle control is dire. However the combat controls are much easier with mouse/keyboard, where you have the option to point directly at a target and move the camera at will. When using a controller, one has to rely on the faulty targetting system which will rarely aim at who you wanted it to and is in general quite clunky. I could also find no option to turn off inverted y-axis aiming for the controller. The upshot of all this was that if I was using a first-person weapon, I would have to grab the mouse to aim, and if a particularly challenging foot-based mission cropped up, I would have to change the control scheme entirely. Workable, but flawed.  Gameplay: I thought this game was exceptionally well structured but first I should add that this is not a good sandbox by modern standards. It was probably the archetype for the modern sandbox 'genre' but things have moved on a lot since then. GTA III is just not able to compete with more recent games in terms of scale, scope or variety. This does not mean however that the game cannot be enjoyed on its own terms. One specific example from my experience was my initial frustration with the lack of any kind of overworld map - something that would be unthinkable in any modern-day open world game - but this merely led to me developing a more thorough knowledge of the city streets than possibly any other game I've played. The areas are large enough to become immersed in, but never so large that you feel lost or overwhelmed and each street almost feels like it has its own unique personality of sorts, which aids navigability and adds to the charm of the experience. If it had not been for the quality of the gameplay, I would not have had the patience to stick with the controls that I described in the previous paragraph.  Story: Behind a minimalistic mission-based story progression, there is actually quite an intriguing plot going on in the background. Nothing particularly special, but more than I was expecting. On a side note, I'm not sure if our protagonist is a soulless mercenary or just a bit dim, but either way he seems more than happy to go along with whatever maniacal schemes his employers hatch for him.  Graphics: This is not a pretty game. I don't believe this to be particularly pertinent, but it's worth pointing out. The best that can be said for them is that they are functional and I was able to tell what everything was.  Sound: Very good. There is no background music in the game besides the intro and credits sequences, but the soundtrack to the game is provided by radio stations which can be accessed while in a vehicle. These cater to a diverse selection of musical tastes, and most players will find at least two favourites which they will keep coming back to. The scripts for the DJs has also been artfully written and it's clear a lot of effort went into creating a cohesive aural environment that acts as a reflection of the city you drive in. This applies tenfold to the talk radio station, Chatterbox, which bears several repeat listenings. The sound effects are also of top quality and you can get a feel of the car you have just entered merely by the sound of its engine revving.   Overall, I do recommend this game to anyone with the patience to work around a poor control scheme and somewhat archaic design to see the unpolished gem that lies beneath them. I do not think it still deserves the piles of praise that were heaped upon it on its initial release, but equally it is impossible to deny its merits, and the irrepressible charisma with which it flaunts them.",

The story of GTA 3 tends to branch itself out with the various interesting characters you meet. I didnt really pay attention to the story too much until GTA IV but i can tell you that 3 does deliver some interesting story telling.  Gameplay: The gameplay is in Thirdperson, but you can switch to first person while using certain weapons. You are able to run, sprint, jump and crouch. There are many cars to drive as well as boats and flyable vehicles.  Music/SFX/Voiceacting: The music to GTA 3 is usually heard via the radio, Rockstar knows how to pick out good songs; its on par with the music selection for Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. The sound effects are also really well made. The voiceacting is pretty good for its time as well.",

Instead it's more focused on the adventure and action in the state of Libety City. You play as Claude, a man shot and left for dead by your girlfriend after a bank heist. You try to crawl back from the bottom of the criminal food chain in redemption for your girlfriend as you end up in a mafia war against the triads. The mafia then betrays you and are forced to go into hiding. There are some flaws with the game such as the El Burro racing mission. El Burro tells you he as a job oppurtunity for you and says you are getting alot of street cred. So then out of nowhere he says you have to race. No explanation, just race. And the whole race is just lag and frusration. Don't believe me, just try the game for yourself. Overall, the game is hella fun and deserves an 8/10!",

The city where the entire population doesn't knows how to swim, the police force specializes in aerial stunts. and going around stopped vehicles is unheard of. You play as Claude, the mute who might as well be blind. Claude has relationship issues, his girlfriend unexpectedly broke up with him, and Claude is doing what he can to get over it.   STORY &amp; ATMOSPHERE: The story isn't something too spectacular. You are a criminal rising up through the ranks, and as your rise up you unveil enemies and get into a bigger mess. However, one thing to mention is the superb voice acting. The voice acting fits the atmosphere of the game very well, even on the radio.. The city feels like a cheap filthy restaurant filled with rodents. Everyone is on their own, or against you. Rats everywhere. Also, the radio stations have a diverse and interesting soundtrack. Varying with Reggae, DnB, 80s' classics, Opera, eccentric hipster Rock, and many more. Not to forget the humerous talk show hosted by the beloved Lazlow. However, radio stations get repititive after a while.  GAMEPLAY: Hit detection is nearly non-existent and cars are very fragile, but the difficulty is great.The game can get very frustrating at times because of this. There is a considerable arsenal of weapons, from explosives to fire to bullets. But I found myself resorting to mostly sniping from afar (for the AI can't sense others' casualties), and running down enemies (as you are safe as long you're inside a vehicle). And thatis because most of the guns have terrible hit detection, deeming you almost a sitting duck with heavy weapons, and a waddling penguin with light weapons. Vehicles get damaged so easily, bursting in flames and switching vehicles during a mission becomes a standard. The combination of being shot at and rammed into does not make it any better. The difficulity rises as you progress, and so does the harshness of cops as you gain a wanted level. I'd say the difficulty is quite balanced for what it is.  For its time, this game was a masterpiece. It opened doors for many developers to go through, and Influenced many of the open-world games today. It has its issues, but I cannot deny how this game changed the gaming industry, and how it was truly genre-defining. If you are looking for a crime-based open-world classic game, try this. Just bear through the flaws.",

I was 5 years old and I started to play and my Dad watched me. I got in a ambulance at the hospital and started to drive great for my age. Little did my Dad know that I would spend $1,000+ on video games after that.  This one game started my gaming career, and I would love to design one of these games for a daily job in the future.   That's just my story, I would give this game a 9/10. Changed the GTA Series from arcade type game to 3D story action/shoot em up game. The fact that each game gives you a bigger free roam makes every GTA Game better. Can't say this any better but, this is my second favorite series in the whole world of Video Games. :)",

            "review_text": "Introduction: I find myself typing this review thinking more about the conceptualization of existence, than the anime itself. Above all, there are two standards I hold true for anime. There are anime that simply entertain for the sake of enjoyment, and there are anime that stretches the boundary of human imagination. Serial Experiments Lain falls in the latter category and for this reason Serial Experiments Lain stands out as a true classic. Serial Experiments Lain pushes the envelope of what the perceived notion of what can be done with television as a medium. The show doesn’t just provide entertainment; it provides insight, and profound views and beliefs about technology and the role it plays in society. With that said it's time to get on with the review.  Story: Given that Lain’s story progression is very disjointed, if the execution were to be even off by the slightest, the show would have been ridden with plot holes. Lain however doesn’t need worry about plot and story in the same sense as other anime, but instead relies on the atmosphere and the characters to tell the story. What little plot Lain does have, the show works with it fabulously. Now some may argue that Lain is completely plot driven, but to each his own. Personally I believe that Lain strays as far as it can from bland episodic story telling, and in essence is similar to Citizen Kane in the aspect that the story has little to do with the show. Lain above all is a character study, and the plot only moves forward under the characters.  Art: Despite the art being off center in terms of traditional anime, it hardly deters from the overall enjoyment of the series. It is important to note that the series actually benefits from the unique art style presented in Lain. Art is not a big pulling factor for Lain, so if you are a fan of high quality art, you may be in for a rough ride.  Sound: The series relies on a minimalist approach to sound and music. Dialogue is sparse, but very profound. Sound effects are seldom used but with brevity, and has a lasting impact on the viewer. Once again, this lack of a quality that would normally be detrimental to an anime’s enjoyment, but becomes one of Lain’s strengths. The sound of the electricity running through power lines, the empty sound of Lain typing on her keyboard, and the scarce use of music. These are all memorable pieces of sound effects that adds to the overall impact of the show.  Character: Now this is where Lain shines brightest. In a vast wasteland of mundane same-old, Lain sticks out as an anime that takes its characters to a level that most anime can only dream of achieving. The character of Lain is perhaps the most deep and relevant characters in anime today. To explain upon this point, one would have to watch the series and comprehend the various themes and motif’s on one’s own. But in order to be brief, Lain’s character can be summarized as ascending from human status, to near God like power through the prowess of the internet. Ahem, I mean, “The Wired.” It’s a simple concept and seems like it has been done before, giving credit to the argument, and it probably has. But the beauty here is the cast of side characters that surround Lain. Her sister, her father, mother, and friends, are all extremely deep characters, that although don’t appear to be, are actually extremely poignant in their own right.  Enjoyment &amp; Closing: If watched with an open mind, Lain will do more than simply entertain. It is truly revolutionary anime for its time, and the amount of depth in the show is utterly staggering. Never in my years of watching anime have I seen a show as thought provoking as Lain. If one were so inclined to contact me, we could talk for hours upon hours of the religious symbols, and religious references that run about the shows course. We could then change the subject to comparing Lain’s character to that of philosophy of the Jungian Shadow. We could converse and discover deeper and more universal meanings as time progressed. Lain is such a show that the viewer doesn’t just watch it. The viewer must be pushed to think, and who doesn’t want to do a bit a of thinking once in a while?",

I respect it for bulding the ground work that future enteries would build upon and for innfluencing practically every open world game to follow (Even if Driver technically did it first) and for successfully making the transition to 3D. That said if you really are in the mood for a retro GTA even Vice City holds up better but that has more to do with it being a more polished successor to GTA III than it does to do with anything else. Not to mention this version has a lot of Windows 98 related compatibilty issues that made my trip down memory lane quite brief and I don't think GTA III is good enough to justify me patching the hell out of it to get it working (fan made patches). I only reccomend it for people who lost their PS2 or Xbox copy.",

[-]: Aiming with a weapon is not smooth and shooting takes a bit of a practice to get used to. Minor bugs but nothing game breaking.  Some missions might be frustrating, especially the time-restricted ones, but once you get past them you forget them quickly enough but not enough to want to do the main story again so soon. Nothing much to do in the game after main storyline is over, some side missions can keep you busy for only a set amount of time and one simply cannot enjoy causing as much mayhem in gta3 as in gta4 or gta5, mostly because the protagonist has to stop every time to fire a weapon, but it is still fun to a certain degree.  Some hidden features like taking the train and subway to get around can only be discovered by mistake or actually reading the game manual.  [...]: Overall, this is a great game for its time and still totally worth someone's time. And there's just something painful but satisfying about not having a full map which forces you to learn the roads and how to get around. That being said the map is not that big.  Oh and before I forget, you get shot on most of the map by the other gangs the more you do the main missions, making it difficult to move around freely later in the game, and absolutely impossible to stop and admire the scenery or do side missions in a gang zone at the end of the game.  [Performance]: Works great on a Windows 10 Laptop having an Intel Z3735F with Intel HD Graphics(Bay Trail) on maximum settings(~40fps on average) at 1366x768.  P.S. After I completed the game, I tried the NaturalHDPack, which is an incomplete texture pack by Dingleman(sadly, not available on steam) which I found by browsing around and the game looks better(~5fps drop in average fps... but totally worth it)...",
