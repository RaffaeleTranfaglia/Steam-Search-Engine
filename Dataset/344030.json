            "review_text": "The game starts off great and then you start playing the actual game. Oh so much disapointment. The game did run on my system. Windows 7 64 bit.     The game starts you off as ghosts. So you can go thru certain things unless its a door then you cant. Dont ask me it why didnt make any sense to me either. You start off with the lead ghost papa doc. and a line of salt you cannot cross. So I was stuck at this point. There is a coconut farm your supposed to go to. I did get that part right. Now your supposed to shake a ladder so you knock off the guy off it. Yes you can grab some things and other things no. Dont ask me why. So you knock him off to open the shed that contains other coconuts that somehow open up and leak milk into a volcano stream. So chickens can come and eat the salt. No joke this is the solution more or less to the first part of this game. Its even more confusing to watch.   So why doesnt papa doc just open up the door of coconuts? Some silly reason of they would just close it again. Oh Boy. I had to watch a video on this just to see how to work this part of the puzzle. Their are no hints inside the game. None. The game is just a mess to be honest. Its not fun its tedious and it feels like work. Its sad to because I really want to like it but the game just feels like a very lazy effort was put into it. The game has some puzzles but logical? Not to me.   So great looking game. Terrible gameplay. Wander around until you find the only solution that is available. Its games like this that killed the click and point adventure game. I got this game in a bundle. Nope I do not recommend this game even if you could get it working. Its boring and its dull. Sad.   Just a side note. I spent most of my time on youtube watching a video walkthru of this game. It didnt inspire me to want to play this in the least. Its a confusing game. More care should have been applied to this game.",
