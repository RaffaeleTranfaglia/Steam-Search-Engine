            "review_text": "If you fondly remember games like TIE Fighter, or Wing Commander you need this game. Also just plain great in VR, whether space combat is your cup of tea or not.  Appended: I should say that I agree with some other reviews that the story content is kinda short. It's about movie-length in terms of how long it'll take you to complete it the first time though.  I disagree that once you've finished the story the game has nothing left to offer, or that it's not worth the asking price of a mere $20. If you're a completionist there's a lot of stuff to go back in for, and the endless mode is just pure starfighter bliss.  If this game had no story mode at all and was just the endless mode I would still think it was $20 well spent, but I'm also admittedly a huge space combat buff so I may be a bit biased.",

This game carves out its niche with pure dogfighting action -- emphasis on the pure. There's a very light tactical aspect where you can order capital ships around (which is helpful on certain missions, since your capships can mount flak weapons to shoot down enemy missiles), but most of the time you'll be flying your own Interceptor blasting enemies to bits. And it's fun! Everything just feels, looks, and sounds right. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "I don't really know what to say about this game, it almost feels like something good. I never understood what was going on; and everything always felt so rushed. Similar to XCOM2, the player always seems to show up at the last possible minute and has to rush to finish everything, except here its always the same scenario: kill some dudes before a capital ship blows up your dudes.  None of the weapons felt like they carried any power to them and the controls for switching between them feel a bit awkward. There also doesn't seem to be much of a choice on how to outfit your ships, and you only ever get to fly the figher class of ship, there are others that join your fleet that you cannot control directly.  It feels like it tried to borrow some theme from Battlestar Galatica with the focus on fighters and the muted sound effects, I think I'm willing to game in a pretend universe where space carries sound though, it makes everything feel that much stronger when it connects.  I find the 3d minimap very confusing; near the end of every mission I always had a hard time figuring out where to point myself to activate the warp.  At first I thought losing my ships would have a large penalty, especially with how they slowly get added to your fleet over time. There does not seem to be any penalty to losing a ship, they even seem to be able to come back in the middle of the battles.   Turning feels really strange, if you brake and turn you can get a sharper turn, which seems a bit odd when you a spaceship in a fictionless environment.   Some of the sound effects, mainly the one it makes when you are in range and aiming at an enemy can get very obnoxious very quickly.  Don't expect anything deep from this game. The mechanics are shallow. The story is non-existent. Other than some shield bubbles showing up partway through the mission tree nothign seems to change.  There is a challenge mode as well, but it seems to just be some randomly generated mission that felt no different from the standard missions.  I wanted to like this game, I've been craving some nice space sims, but after only playing for about an hour I think I'm pretty much near the end. I'll probably finish it up but won't bother going for any completion.",

The perfect starfighter/traitor punishment sim.  Slick style and sound, feels great, and a hint of fascinating lore.   Fairly short, but in the sense that it encourages you to replay it at harder difficulties anyway. Has an indefinite leaderboard challenge mode for when you've exhausted the campaign and want to Ice Man/Maverick it against everyone else. And then of course there's the Dragon Difficulty setting.   Amazing developer who is probably beset on all sides by horrible people demanding he build in better parameters for their Thrustmaster Prostate Massager HOTAS or whatever",

Controls are tight, weapons are fun and have good variety, and there are interesting tradeoffs to be made for the upgrades. Despite the lack of super detailed texture work or high poly models the game is nice to look at and makes good use of limited resources.   The only downside to the game is it's length. Give us more, dev.",

            "review_text": "At 4.2 hours into this game while writing this review, I can say that I've done all that there is to really do in this game. The only things I have yet to do are finish the hard and expert level difficulties of all the missions, but really they are not much different from the previous difficulties.  It’s a mixed bag for this game, and I’ll list why below. I’m going to recommend it because I’m finding it sort of difficult to find any decent VR games that aren’t just a 3rd person perspective camera with movement linked to your head. Cockpit games just have the edge in VR.  PROS: - A decent VR (Played with the Rift) cockpit space fighting game where you command a growing squad - The combat is good too, good pacing and you’re able to change out your weapons and ship upgrades for slightly different play styles - Supports the X-55 Rhino Saitek joysticks, though as usual you will need to figure out the mapping. ( I actually ended up using the Xbox One controller, which worked perfectly)  CONS: - Lack of content. Probably the biggest downfall of this game, there just simply isn't enough content. I was able play the game to what I'm considering completion in 4 hours. - The squad management screen can be annoying at times, when you're trying to cycle through your units and just can't seem to get the right unit selected. - While able to buy upgrades to get more stuff, once you get the first 5 upgrades, there really is no driving force to get the other ones other than preference or curiosity. I didn’t use any of them to beat the game and I rarely changed anything.",

No complex controls, just pure, refined space combat action.  The common Tie Fighter meets homeworld description is a good start but it's worthy of deeper exploration. Also, it's amazing in VR.  So it's a must own for fans of the genre and VR users alike.   ",

            "review_text": "I have to say I really enjoyed this game. The combat is fast paced and challangeing and it really has a Freelancer/Homeworld feel to it. I liked the hit an run style of the missions, and found the story very intriguing. It took me about 16 hours to complete all the achievements but it only took an hour or so to finish the game itself. That is really the only major issue with the game for me. There is not enough of it.  House of th Dying Sun really has a LOT of potential for more content. I'd love to see more story/lore, like bios on the trator lords with portrats and info on who they are and how &amp; why they helped the rebellion, logos and background info about their houses, stuff like that. Would be great for some voice over interaction as well, like an intro vid about the assassination, mission briefings, maybe even have a few of the lords pleading for their lives or something.   The Missions again are fun, but they sometimes feel to short. It would be great to see more stages for some missions, and more types of missions other than warp in kill a few targets then warp out.  I don't feel the $19.99 usd price tag is too much for what you get, there is some extended replayability with the challange mode and all the achievements. If you don't complete them your really not getting the full experience. But if you don't want to pay that much just put it on your wishlist and buy it when it goes on sale.   It's definitly a game worth playing.",

There isn't very much flexibility in its fleet building and contains very few ship types for you to use, And if you unlock a ship, it stays with you forever (unless you restart the game i assume). This game is very fun to play but it would be great if the developers could make you be able to make your own fleet, because it would be really cool if i could exchange the capital ships into multiple interceptors so i could have some cool dogfighting gameplay. This game has very few bugs but hopefully in the future they could add more weapon and ship types. If you are interested in piloting one of the fighter ships in a space battle, and want a (very) simplified Homeworld style rts game then this may be the game for you.",
