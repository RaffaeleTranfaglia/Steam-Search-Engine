You can think its is a RPG Maker on 3D steroid, and the devs are like lighting fast to reply to your questions,  and constantly upgrade the code and get new functions for FREE! (And workshop in the future! YAY!)  Tough there are yet some vital event or condition functions missing currently (but the devs are already promised to plan to add them later), comparing to its 2D rival (I am looking at you RMMV you piece of unreliable sh!t), but SGB is more like a early prototype of the next gen thing.   Try the demo, I promise you would like it in no time!",
