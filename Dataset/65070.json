            "review_text": "I've reached Rank 1 and finished the game, here's my view.  The handling is terrible so let's rule out all the circuit racing etc. Drag racing is incredibly easy. I slaughtered everything in my path every time. Betting full amount I can each time I had copious amounts of money, bought the best I could and once I reached the boss, well... he was too easy.  The customising part is minimal. Has a few set things you can do. Things such as wheel size can affect speed so there are small factors that can come into play but you're never that close in races for it to matter other than you own personal best 1/4 mile times etc. As for styling you can do a few basic things but nothing major. Paint, wheels, tires, ride height, window tints, and some special things like gold trim.  There is a mode where you can use hydraulics to complete in competitions. I can't get it to score any points in the freestyle no matter how much I try. Probably bugged. It's fun to play around with hydros for a few mins in the test mode but it gets boring after that.  It has a score system for reputation for each race. No idea what that does. I think it might affect multiplier in the hydro mode but again, can't score, so useless.  I was hoping it would get more difficult as the game went on but nothing changed. It was the same from start to finish.",

            "review_text": "Ever wanted to play a low budget version of Need For Speed Underground? Probably not, right?   Graphics  Even though it has been a while since i've played NFS:Underground, I would say graphically Ride 'Em Low is somewhere on the same level as NFS:U was back in 2003. Personally, I don't mind if a game is not up to date on todays standards, as long as it brings something new to the table.   Gameplay  Ride 'Em Low starts like most race games these days; Buy a second hand car, tweak it and start racing. Unlike NFS:U, you do not get to drive around the city (as in freemode). The races themselves are pretty boring compared to other race games and I can't even name anything great about them. It seems that if you tuned your car well enough, you will win the race otherwise you will simply lose.   Sound/Music  Obviously a low budget game can't get the licenses for music like EA could with NFS but in this game the music is worse than the original Need For Speed game. Uninspiring Music which will most likely annoy you after a few game rounds. The other sounds are nothing special either.   Conclusion  Ride 'Em Low is only interested to people who do not own and have never played any good race game over the past 15 years or own the game because of some bundle like I did.     ",

Maybe if it was a lil cheaper i'd reccomend it but for what it is at this day and time I would wait untill it is cheaper like I did. I do enjoy this game for the jumpy-car side and the car customization is amazing!!! But for racing the handling is terrible and eww yuck those graphics are terrible for 2015 (it was realsied in 2013 too)!!!  So should should you it? No, unless it is cheaper/on special and you don't want the game for the racing you want it for the cusomization and super fun jumpy jumps then yes.. But in the end it is really your choice, read some other reviews to help make up your mind!",
