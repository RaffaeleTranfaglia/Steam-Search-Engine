Look up 'disappointing' in the dictionary and it probably shows the title of this game. And it was pretty good actually. Possessing objects and interacting with them is fun. Especially if you can scare a bunch of people at the same time. The animations and designs are just excellent, by the way. And sure, the controls for possessing objects could've been much better (a mouse would've worked better, or a 'snap-to' system), and the UI could've been more intuitive but the game was fun for as long as it lasted. Still, some extra levels couldn't have hurt the game, they could've even improved it a bit.  [Rating: 71/100]",

            "review_text": "Haunt the House : Terrortown is a game where you basically play as a ghost and your objective is to scare people by possessing an item in a map.  Before proceeding, you might want to skip my review below to 'Pros &amp; Cons' at the end of the review if you can't understand my english : The gameplay is simple, you're playing as a ghost and your objective is to scare people, how? by possessing an object/item scatter through the map/level, each item had unique scare animation (2-3 scare animation) which need to be unlocked by filling the scare meter, as the meter fills up the new animation will be unlocked and also you can't scare someone without possessing an item (you can't possess a person, keep that in mind) and ofc as a ghost you can move freely through wall and floor. There's 4 map/level in this game, the original map on flash game and new one, the map design is creative and each of them unique. Grapich and art are cute and colorful, the animation is also quite nice. Love the soundtrack, i still humming the tune till now since 2011, the character/ghost sound effect is also nice (love that ghost boo sounds) Beside the nostalgia, this game is really enjoyable and fun to play even with friends/family, i played this game with my family and compete who's the fastest one to complete the map, the game is also quite hilarious.   + Simple Gameplay + Fun + 4 Level with huge replayability + Unique map design + Huge variety of item to choose + Soundtrack + Humor, i laugh so hard playing this game - Unexpected Crash (not often but quite annoying, don't worry the game will save itself when crashed)  Score : 8/10 Haunt the House is pretty much a game where you want quick entertainment back from work or school to relieve some stress. Grab the game while you still can before the ghost grab you souls I still remember myself back then playing this game on a website (i can't remember what the website name is but... it was flash game website), i've put many hours on this game, tried different method, tried to 'kill' every person, etc.... to be honest, if my friend didn't play this game (I saw his pop-up playing this) maybe i never knew this version of Haunt the House exist. Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.",

Only the main game has any story whatsoever, and non of the levels have a proper ending. Even the level that is a remake of the origanal is missing its story. Speaking of the remake, they changed a lot of things that didn't need to be changed (for example a lot of good sound effects were changed for no reason). I can only recomend this game if you played and REALLY liked the origanal flash version.",

Plus, there's three additional levels to the game that the developers seem to have added for free.  $4.99 IS a bit much for this short of a game, but this isn't a cash grab by any means.

You'll finish the game in about half an hour and if the mechanisms of the game don't charm you you'll be tired of it before that. A lot of work has been but in the game, each object has its own effects and all, but it's not really enough to make you want to try them all. There are different ghosts you can unlock but they don't do anything different apart from slightly changing the sound you make when pressing S. The controls are kind of unfinished too, mostly I expected controller or mouse support but there wasn't any. It's all done with the keyboard and in a kind of awkward way (you use S to confirm in the menus instead of Enter or space, and D to come back instead of escape).  If you want some bit of fun I recommend it but only if it doesn't bother you to put 5€ in it. Which isn't a lot in itself, simply, the game suffers from the comparaison to other amazing and long games you can find out there for the same price.",

It didn't drag out so you'd get bored and there was much lovely details in the things you could do in each map. I will not say anything on price as I bought it in a bundle and got it for a very low sum. It is, as said very short so you might want to consider waiting for a sale if you're only going to play through it once.  The game mechanics are very easy to grasp and it's easy to get started, no long outstreched interactive tutorials. You start the game and within a minute or two and you're off to scare the public into never leaving their house again and possibly killing a few sivilians in the prosses.  The graphics are nice and I personaly love how they made the ghost. There are many lovely details in how you may scare people, and as the people in the building becomes more scared you get new things to do while posessing an object. The soundtrack is fun yet not overwhelming and drifts nicely into the bacground as you play.  I will warn you that to properly enjoy this game you should have a bit of morbid humor and find joy in spamming buttons. I loved it and will probably play through it again to see if I can beat my previous score.",

            "review_text": "Haunt the House: Terrortown is one of my favourite games. I watched Steam Train play this and I knew I had to buy it.   It feels awesome to float around as a ghost to possess items to spook people, making them run around in the levels. The art style is very adorable, and colour schemes of the levels are gorgeous. I took so many screenshots. The background music is great, especially in the ghost train level. There's a really pleasent atmosphere, which is quite ironic since the goal is to make each room's atmosphere terrifying.  The only bad thing I can think of was me getting frustrated while trying to get the more challenging achievements, but they wouldn't be called achievements if they were too easy right?",

Don't worry, nostalgia fans, the original Mansion level is included in here.  lmao i think this needs to win villain in need of a hug because that ghost just wants someone to play with",

            "review_text": "This game has really outstanding audiovisuals - it reminds me two of my favorite Double Fine's games: Psychonauts and The Cave. Hence, art-wise, it would rank it 10/10.  However, game-wise - which, unfortunately, is the most important point of view here - it just doesn't play well. Gameplay is somewhat chaotic, there's really no information about how to scare people effectively, and it is just repetitive. Achievements here are also a weak point - they are almost exactly the same for each level, demanding just to interact with every single item possible in every available way.  I am really sad to post a negative review here. Especially that few years ago I have played flash version of this game - which included only Mansion level - and rated it 5 out of 5 on Kongregate. I think that what was a good idea for an original flash game just doesn't seemto work very well for a little bigger standalone game.",
