            "review_text": "This is probably one of the most underrated games ever, just because of the saturation of shooters that happened during its release. But the reality is, that this specific shooter has very interesting features that the others don't have. Basically those would be:   A truth system with allies, with the possibility to choose between teammates. Unique enemies (just robots all the game, which its great). It feels a lot like Vanquish. A very interesting story. Yes, it really has a nice story. Who could have though something like that with a shooter? A lot of cinematics, some very lenghty ones. I don't know but it feels like a Hideo Hojima game sometimes.  All of this, maybe because the game was made by a japanese studio. So yeah, it's another shooter, but a very interesting one and unique. As I said, it remembers a lot to Vanquish, and obviously, Vanquish is better, but since there is no Vanquish on PC, this alternative is excellent, and should feel kinda enough for the ones that probably never gonna have the chance to play it.  The only problem that I really found with this game, was with issuing orders with your voice thorugh a mic. I'm just gonna say that it's better to ignore that feature and keep issuing orders like old school times, with Keyboard/Mouse or a Controller. You don't really need to issue orders with your voice, it's not necessary, and the game is still very enjoyable without that.",

Not only jump into a boring plain third person shooting adventure just simply running and walking shooting from one place to another, but we can also taste many fun from another scene and combat scenes like : survive from collapsing skyscraper building, gun fire in fast moving train against robots, gun fire in a crazy street racing against super big size boss motor robot, driving jet skies.  + Having various kinds of weapons + Big ammo supplies + I like the default assault rifle, which can blast energy ball (can be upgraded if u buy Binary Domain DLC Pack) +/- The game has decent difficulties (Will be very hard to defeat boss) + Found many strong unique big size robot boss enemies - For such hard game it has low medical supply (only 3 per person)    About online Binary Domain ?

            "review_text": "This game is complicated, REALLY complicated...  I installed it and played the rest of it (I had already played like 2 hours of it before on Steam) exclusively for a review that was asked. I didn't want to play it. The first 2 hours were terrible. I was crying of boredom...  It was too repetitive, too much handholding and linear, cutting from slow walking with stupid talking that didnt do any good to the combat, fighting 3 soldiers and going back to talking and pressing buttons. First 2 chapters are painfully terrible for me. 3 is better and 4 and so on are good and evolve into even better...   Anyways I finished Binary Domain and I can safely say it redeems itself after a while but it's still not trophy-winning. It truly is one of the best examples of 'It gets better as you go along'.  Ok into the review itself, Binary Domain is a game where you play as Adam Sandler in a robot filled world! And I can say the PC Port is outright ♥♥♥♥. Seriously, complete ♥♥♥♥. You have the 'Play' and 'Settings' Options before lauching the game. To configure the game: you have to pick the 'Settings' option, which will freak out and the window does not seem to be compatible with my Screen Native Resolution! How come, you ask? Well, you can tweak everything fine, BUT! The Save and Quit option is absolutely out of my reach because it's behind my taskbar so I cant press it, thus I have to fullscreen the settings window and THEN it has a small part of the button that is actually clickable!  Right now you're probably wondering: Wait, isn't that how Kane &amp; Lynch 2 had it's options? Yes, you are correct BUT Kane &amp; Lynch 2 also had the options in the game itself! So if the game needed tweaks you could change it without the need of quitting the actual game.   Binary Domain has a nice set of options, but the performance itself is decent and decent only! So if you need to tweak minor stuff, you have to quit the game, tweak it, boot it up, test it, if it's poor still, you have to exit, rinse and repeat.  It feels like the PC version of the game is a massive afterthought, which is sad.   The visuals themselves aren't bad though, particles effects are really well done, facial animation are a bit stiff but get the job done. Overall texture quality is decent as well. Regarding the visuals: THIS GAME HAS TOO MANY CUTSCENES! Some of them are completely useless and they weren't needed at all. So, it happens that I skipped some, *clicks skip* - *new cutscene appears* - *clicks skip* - *New... ok you get the point. If my memory doesn't fail me, the game can have 4 CUTSCENES IN A ROW! I swear the game could have half those cutscenes without hindering the game itself at all!  That being said, I must say the cutscenes are quite cliché but look genuinely good and some of the best cutscenes I could see in a video game. The action/story-important cutscenes, not the useless ones, those are boring and, again, useless!  Voice acting is rather cliché, but it's still cool as the game has a nice B-Movie feel with plenty of jokes and it works really well imo!  While the voice acting is simple, I can say Sandler's voice acting is actually REALLY GOOD! His facial animations and voice overs in cutscenes are really well done. The rest is a bit less memorable but still good overall. (Troy Baker plays Charlie in the game, I swear to God when I saw that in the credits, I was like 'lolwut...').   The game has that classic japanese poses and influence for sure. Almost everytime a cutscene ends, Adam makes that soldier pose with a badass face and then the shooting starts!  Combat: Adam's main rifle (which you cannot switch for another gun, it stick with you the WHOLE Game) is awesome! It feels great! Headshotting a robot is beyond satisfying and the secondary fire mode (Pulse Grenade Launcher-ish) is also a nice addition to the weapon. Everytime you kill an enemy you get points, more so for melee kills or headshot kills. Those point can be spent in medic kits (which dont heal you (the game has health regen), instead they revive you if you get downed), ammo or weapon upgrades for Adam's rifle or his companion's special weapon's...  AI is good.  Mr. Sandler's moving, however, is weird. When you get down stairs or a ledge you suddely move 4 times faster while getting down the stairs, sometimes you move so fast you actually run OVER the stairs and fly across them, which is hilarious!  When sprinting, you have trouble controlling Adam's body, which is fine except this ♥♥♥♥s up the running sequences, because stuff's falling, you're moving and dodging, except that you aren't because while sprinting it's tricky to move sideways, this makes the running away sequences poor and boring. P.S: You will die alot in them...  The cover system works well enough so kudos for that...  My biggest problem however is purely combat related: when shot, Adam can't stand the bullets going into his 1000 pounds battle power armor, so he flinches so f*cking much it's literally unbelievable! It makes the combat stiff! I remember a little test I did, I got shot by a 'boss' (not really a boss, but he had a mean-♥♥♥ sniper-rifle (those who played the game know who I'm talking about) and my character's aim literally moved 40 degrees to the right!   Trust me, it's fine to have flinch, it should have, but not this much! I mean, when a regular robot shoots you, your aim goes up too much for me, making the combat a little less fun than it should. However you can get back in cover, wait and get back into aiming and shooting. But still, this annoys the hell out of me.  Another huge issue is the stuns. The protagonist gets stunned/downed for everything! a grenade explodes 5 yards away *Tries to keep balance*.  *Robot clunkily bashes you with his fist* = *falls over and takes forever to get up*  It makes the pacing of the combat too stupidly slow, and this back and forth between shooting a magazine and falling over that is really annoying as for a small amount of seconds you have to stare at the computer, seeing Adam in an angel position on the floor!  Next up: the quicktime events! Trust me, there aren't many at all! BUT! The first time a quick time event in particular appeared, it has arrows and 2 space bar icons. I literally was 1 minute trying to figure it out before I failed and decide to plug in my controller and do it with the controller. I then got it.  Maybe I'm stupid in understanding coded messages but that was really weird to understand for me and it left me really frustrated.  Enouh of this. The combat is satisfying enough to carry the whole game alongside:   The story and the philosophy behind it. I will not even mention much about the story (You go on a top secret mission to investigate a big robot-making corporate), but the philosophy behind the game is really good and well done. It gives truly special moments to question out existance as humans and who we can have walking by our sides. This robot/human interaction in society is a good touch I never expected to get into me this much nor did I expect it to be this well fleshed out by the end of the game.  One last thing too, the plot twist behind this game. I read comments before going into the final chapter and some like 'Wow, plot twist was bat-sh*t insane, omg so cool*, it wasn't, I smelled the thing from miles away! Not sure if you, dear reader, will predict it too, but on my case, it disappointed me that I nailed what the twist was going to be.  Story is still pretty good, nothing too special, the philosophy behind it is what makes it stand out, though...  The game's length isn't bad either, it was 7.5-8 hours long for me, but I know friends who did it in 11 hours so it depends on the player. There's also multiplayer and a co-op wave based survival. Both are dead though survival can be played alone.  (Word Limit, gotta wrap up) It really gets MUCH better (from boring to fun), under 10€ is worth it for me... 6/10",

Pros -  - Very solid and decent third person cover shooting. - Hundreds of evil robots to kill which shatter in to itty bitty pieces. - Your side kick looks like uncle Phil from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air! - A cheesy B-movie script which is surprisingly well acted. - It's a Japanese game so during cutscenes the camera will zoom in on the female character's boobies for no reason (That's a plus right?) - Will run at a silky smooth 60fps on your old toaster of a PC. - Likeable characters who ♥♥♥♥ talk eachother at every available opportunity.  Cons -  -Really weird keyboard controls and if you use a controller the on-screen prompts still tell you to press keyboard keys which i find to be pretty distracting. - The multiplayer is deader than disco but it probably wasn't all that great anyway.",

            "review_text": "Binary Domain is a third-person shooter developed and published by Sega. The story starts soon after an android attacked Bergen's headquarters, previously having no idea that he was a robot himself. Believing that robotics genius and founder of Amada corporation, Yoji Amada, created the robot, the International Robotics Technology Association (IRTA) sent one of their Rust Crews to Japan to find Amada and bring him in for questioning under orders from the UN Security Council. The gameplay is really fun to play. The player can issue commands to squad mates by pressing certain buttons or voice, via a headset. You can turn off the voice commands. The game features a consequence system, which decides how the squad views and trusts the player. Their opinion of the player is based on how the player performs and treats team members. This affects both the story and the gameplay, where the characters behave differently depending on trust levels. Conversations between the player and the squad members can also affect trust levels. The end of the game will change, depending on the level of trust the team members have in the player. Stats of both the player and the squad members can be augmented with nanomachines, as well as weapon upgrades, that can usually be bought at shops that the player can find throughout the game. The enemy AIs adjust themselves on how to fight back against the player's advance, depending on the situation. On the other hand, the squad AIs is pretty bad sometimes, walking in front of the player while firing. This is an overlooked title, I highly encourage anyone to at least try the demo.",

There are genuinely good moments in both the gameplay and the story but in the end it mostly ended up being a very mediocre experience. The shooting and cover based mechanics are pretty much identical to gears of war which is a bad thing to me because i always found the gears of war gameplay dull, boring, repetitive and that gameplay translates over to binary domain. I just think that there are alot of better third person cover based shooters out there like spec ops the line, mass effect 2, max payne 3 etc. The story has its moments but it also ends up being average at best. It's brought down by cringeworthy cheesy and cliche dialogue, unlikeable and bland protaginist and side characters and moments in the story that just made me roll my eyes. Your teams ai is awful there is no reason to give out commands that whole mechanic is broken and wasted and game is unplayable with keyboard and mouse so keep that in mind. I hated the boss battles too that people praise its just bullet sponged with no strategy.  4/10 (Mediocre)",

            "review_text": "The short review: It’s Gears of Wars with robots instead of aliens. If that premise disgusts you, the post-cyberpunk storyline could be enough to save the experience.  Binary Domain was published and developed by Sega, by the same internal team who brought us the Yakuza games for Playstation 2 and 3. The Yakuza games are essentially JRPGs with an open world veneer, a realtime hand-to-hand combat system set in a sprawling recreation of Tokyo and other Japanese locales with many people and things to interact with. So it’s a bit peculiar that the same team came out with something that may be considered “opposite” to that format: a linear, cover-centric third person shooter set in a beautiful yet sterile dystopian sci-fi world. So many third person shooters in this vein have popped up this past console generation. Some had you kill hordes of aliens (Gears of War series) while others had you mow down fields of Africans (Resident Evil 5) or the entire population of China (Kane &amp; Lynch 2). Binary Domain presents the player with a different, less-fleshy kind of enemy to dismember and destroy: heartless robots and scraps of evil metal. It’s a refreshing change to be “killing” these scrap heaps, shooting their metal bodies and watching the various parts and components spark and hit the ground. The sensation is often invigorating, like smashing an empty aluminum can on your forehead or something (I’ve never done that before). The guns have a big, weighty feeling, like holding the big plastic guns from one of those old Sega light-gun arcade games such as Gunblade NY. And you can rest easy as they crumble to the ground, knowing that it’s only a soulless piece of machinery that you so ruthlessly filled with submachine gun bullets.   (...B-but, c-can I really destroy these creatures without any remorse???)  Binary Domain’s storyline is part Ghost in the Shell, part Terminator, part schlocky action-movie machismo. The main dude you play as, Dan, is somewhat charming and cool but also an idiot, as are many of the other squad members you interact with. The “romance” is laughably bad and I won’t mention any more of it. The real meat of the story deals with an arms race between two corporations to produce the most advanced robots, with one of those companies eventually creating a robot that could pass for a human. These robots come to be known as “Hollow Children” and their spread is feared by various governments. Your job, as part of a multinational coalition, is to go to Japan and find the original creator of the Hollow Children and bring him in for questioning.These Hollow Children have no idea they’re actually robots and can blend in a crowd with authentic skin, voices, and everything. Without giving too much away, this leads to a lot of fun questions and twists (Is he a robot? Is she a robot? Am I a robot?). Though it’s cool to see these themes touched upon, the game never really delves too much deeper into the ontology of man-made beings like the way the Ghost in the Shell film or other cyberpunk canon did. It’s here to give you a fun time, first and foremost. To quote a dialogue from a cutscene at the beginning of the game, an army man in a military boardroom ponders, “If it’s indistinguishable from humans, where does the machine end, and life begin?” which gets this response from a gruff comrade: “This is philosophical bull ♥♥♥♥.” The game’s narrative tips in the direction of that latter sentiment most of the time. We, the average consumer, like games because they let us toss plasma grenades at baddies and give us protagonists who leer at hot chicks, fistbump and make little jokes. Questions surrounding our increasingly digital existence seem at odds with the desire to let loose and have a bit of a good fun time. A philosophical challenge doesn’t give me the same kind of challenge that a huge robotic gorilla sub-boss does.  There is fun to be had, definitely. The bosses are huge, have unique designs and can be quite difficult. There’s a French robot who joins your team complete with a ridiculous accent. The guns feel good and the squad command system is kinda cool to tinker around with. But with all this emphasis on squads and teamwork, it’s really a shame that there’s no local or online co-op mode in the campaign. Maybe the developers want you to get close and share struggles and joys with the AI teammates, mirroring the way the human characters in the game’s narrative interact with the various robots and Hollow Children. I’m a cynic though, so I’ll chalk up the lack of co-op to a rushed development cycle or a design oversight.   Despite my complaints and exhaustion with the genre, Binary Domain is still better than the average third person shooter and worth a look. Its narrative is an entertaining mix of action and sci-fi, a good weekend thrill. The gameplay, while a bit derivative, is competent and has a few new neat mechanics to offer. So, go tear apart these robots limb by limb, have a small pondering session, and then quickly return to the fun of the violent sparks. Having fun is what separates us from those things, isn’t it?",

Your teammates can receive orders (optional by headset) and will remember your actions towards them which will also influence the ending of the game.  Ammunition and upgrades for weapons or your characters, can be bought at plenty of stations which are placed throughout the game.  You will fight against robots 99.9% of the time which makes 'tactical destruction' possible. So if you shoot a robot's head off, it will shoot at it's allys; if you remove it's legs it will crawl on the floor towards you; boss enemies have different weak points. The remains of robot parts also function as the currency in-game. Overall a very nicely done system.   From the technical side though there are several flaws:   The game is hard-coded to 16:9 resolutions, so you'll have black bars on monitors of another aspect ratio (pretty common for console ports nowadays though).   You also have an very annoying always-on mouse acceleration, which makes aiming with the mouse unnecessarily more difficult. For partly fixes visit  PCGW  [pcgamingwiki.com] ), but since you can't get completely rid of it, playing with a controller is recommended.  Worth mentioning is that you can change the field of view (which is imo very narrow by default).

They kept the merged keys, so usually there is one button for 2 or 3 actions which makes everything much worse. There are no graphics options, and almost no in-game options. As a port it is failed in so many ways. The graphics are serviceable. Characters look good from a distance, but closeup the poor texture quality can be seen. Regular robot enemies are looking okay, they lose a lot of scrap before die, which looks great. There are some sequences where it is almost like a terminator game. Locations are okay, sometimes a little bit too strict. There are many good designs in terms of bosses, which are a lot of here. Also, there are too many special sequences in the game. Otherwise, boss fights can be interesting and rather frustrating either. This is a mixed bag. The story itself is starting to get interesting after a few hours, but becomes quite a mess in the end. There are many cliched and cheesy scenes which are way out of track. The twists are pretty much foreseeable by anyone who used to watch movies. There is not much to say about it. In the 2/3 of the game there is a chance to select your teammates which will carry on with you. This adds some variety to the game. For example, I managed to select the robot with another one out of 5, then him out of 2 before a gas chamber room. He even said that he is not having a problem with the situation. There are various speech from squaddies during the missions which are spot on. They should had a lot of work with all the different dialogs. There are some 'rpg' elements also. You can buy upgrades for your mates, earn their trust by agreeing with them and leveling up their weapons. The options are pretty slim, but at least there are some.  Overall, I had a rough start, enjoyed the middle and got exhausted by the end. I played on normal, and I do say I am happy, because I had enough pain with the mechanics and the bosses.

Well, this game makes me remember all those things. It's a TPSr that uses the old school arcade shooter formula incredibly.  The game is about a group of 'special ops' infiltrating japan to destroy a giant robotic conspiracy. The story isn't all that deep, it's pretty generic, however the execution is top-notch and most of teh characters are really charismatic and don't play much on the usual gruff characters most TPS tend to do.  The gameplay is incredible, I played using KB + M and it was incredibly responsive and since you'll mostly move to get a better shooting position, you'll be most of the time in a single covered place and shooting. The companions give proper cover and have a reasonably good AI. Shooting enemies in different spots make for different effects, you can take enemies' weapons. No complaints in this part.  It's kind of sad that multiplayer is mostly dead nowadays, but aisde from that, it's a great game.",

Binary Domain is a Sci-Fi RPG/Third-Person Shooter occurring in near-future Japan. You play as Dan Marshall, generic white action hero, as you discover the truth behind events which violate the New Geneva Convention. Since I don't write long reviews, I'll use a pro/con format.  Pros: -Good cover mechanics. -Enemies fall apart as you shoot them, and will crawl to you if you shoot their legs off, or will shoot allies if you get a headshot. -Graphics are nice, considering the release date of the game. -Runs on an i3 with HD 3000 graphics. -Story is very Blade Runner.  Cons: -Not a whole lot of variety of guns. -I have the collapsing bridge bug, had a friend play past that. -Is rather repetitive after a while since you're shooting robots, although said robots use cover and try to flank you. -I personally hate Quick-Time Events",

The weapons could use more kick, especially when hitting the limbs of an enemy. The bullets fired both look and feel small like they have no PUNCH! These things should have been large, hard-hitting objects that should have caused enemy limbs to jerk nearly half a foot, before coming to rest in the standard animation. Yet it's still fun to shoot off limbs and disable enemy robots. It just could have used more punch! Meanwhile, action sections are broken up with interactive social elevator rides, which allows the time and ability to talk to characters and teammates. But these are the most boring sections of the game, besides the story. It's interesting to hear some of the chatter sometimes though I think these sections are unnecessary. The game would have been better off throwing the story in the background and going straight up arcade. Where the story is still present, but the game isn't bogged down by the social events. Binary Domain would have been better as an arcade TPS (third-person shooter), but for what it is it's not bad.   Pick it up if you're interested in all the arcade aspects - the shooting, limb destruction, and action etc. - but, want something a bit more focused on story.",

            "review_text": "I had played the demo of this a while ago, and felt then that it had decent, if generic, third person cover-based shooter gameplay and a weird voice-activated squad command system that I didn't expect to use.  Turns out that that was a completely correct assessment that nevertheless managed to completely miss the point.  Binary Domain tells the story of a covert task force sent into Japan to investigate the source of Hollow Children, robots indistinguishable from humans that actually believe that they are human until they are activated. The perfect sleeper agents, who have been popping up across the world recently. All clues point to a mysterious robotics company, led by a director that hasn't been seen in public in decades.  If that feels generic then you would be correct, the game hits a bunch of tropes over the course of its ~15 hour campaign. In much the same vein your team doesn't consist of international characters, but rather of international stereotypes.  The arrogant American, the bro-tastic African American, the sarcastic Brit, the smooth French one, the stoic Chinese one. Players are unfortunately locked in as the arrogant American, but are free to choose which characters they bring on missions (up to two, only ones they've already encountered) which covers roles of the team that you don't want to take care of yourself. Don't feel like sniping? Bring the sniper. Prefer sniping instead? Leave her home and bring an assault character instead that will draw fire as you pick off enemy robots from a distance.  Yep, robots. All opposition you'll face, except for some very few exceptions, will be robotic creations of the robotics conglomerate. This might sound boring, but it allows for some very nice destruction systems where you can disable parts of your opponents, changing their behaviours. The generic humanoid variants will crawl around if you shoot off their legs and will start shooting their allies instead of you if you manage to shoot their heads off.  Your squad mates will comment on everything you do, from yelling out requests for assistance to compliments on successful takedowns to talking about recent plot developments. You are able to respond to these, theoretically by using voice commands but for the people that couldn't be bothered (like me) there are also keyboard / controller responses available. They way you interact with your squad mates will raise or lower their opinion of you which does... something.  I've only completed one playthrough, so I'm not quite sure what things could all have gone differently, but I feel that some squad members coming to my rescue and a romance subplot were optional things that I managed to trigger by which squad members I favoured. This means that my opinion of the ending that I got might be completely irrelevant to your potential playthrough, but I  REALLY  liked the ending.  In fact, my opinion of the game almost consistently got higher and higher from its slightly shaky start. Everything slowly ramps up until an admittedly very... classic, quite predictable final boss fight that I felt was very satisfying (and, as it should be, it is definitely the hardest fight in the game, at least it was for me).  If you feel like playing a fun, highly playable action game with some clever twists and turns that gets better if you stick with it, definitely give Binary Domain a try.",

            "review_text": "I'll break my review down into chunks  Gameplay: The gameplay while it can get repetative the sheer fact that you can dismantly your robotic enemies to hinder their fighting capability or destroy their armor to expose weakpoints like destroying the head so it starts shooting other robots. Another great thing is the boss fights while they can be your typical generic fights they still prove to be a good challenge. The game also throws in some RPG elements like upgrading weapons although sadly its only for primary weapons and not for your secondary or pistol and there is also skill augments to boost health and such. Last but not least the AI for the game works well although and responds well to the command system although its not recommended to use voice commands since its very buggy.  Story: The story starts off kind of well and slows down a bit but around chapter 3 it really starts to pick up and near the end it has some really good bud mind♥♥♥♥ing twists to it that will leave you hungering for SEGA to hurry up and make a sequel.  Characters: All of the characters have great voice actors and are very well animated with my favorite being Cain that is an android halfway through the game.  Graphics: The graphics overall are very well done although nothing that will push the capabilities of any machine so most people can run it on high settings with no problem. Its to be noted the game has a 30 FPS cap set on it because this is a really bad PC port so they didnt do the simple task of taking off the limit but like many PC games simply modding/adding a file can remove the FPS restriction to provide smoother animations and such.  Sound: Truthfully I didn't notice the music too much because I was so focused on blowing the robots to bits but the sound effects are well done.  Bugs: Camera bug - The game has no bugs to speak of although once or twice I had a camera bug which is no big deal because the game uses checkpoint autosaves almost every 100ft or so on the levels making it easy to restart from a checkpoint if you encounter this bug. So if you encounter it just restart from a checkpoint because its not that big of a deal to be honest. Control prompt bug? - Can't really say if this is a bug since generally most ♥♥♥♥ PC ports of games have really badly optimized control schemes but the prompts in this game tell you 'M' to fire(left click), aim down sights(right click), and lastly to use the shock burst ability(hold down middle moust button) which is annoying at first but you can easily deal with it after you get used to it 1-2 chapters into the game.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Good shooter with a good story and awesome boss fights, worth playing and still good looking.  In a not too distant future, science allows to build robots which can be so humanlike, that you can't tell the difference from a normal human. To make it worse: robots have appeared which believe to be human themselves, and you are send to investigate the origin of these robots after one of them ran amok in the USA. Welcome to Japan, where the most advanced robot producing company produces their 'products'.  Binary domain starts as one of the usual third person shooters with covers announcing everywhere you'll get to find the enemy. As usual, you have a main weapon and you can pick up secondary weapons according to the situation. The enemies are robots with guns in different sizes and with different equipment like bulletproof shields or jetpacks. You play in a team with other soldiers with everyone having their own traits and even a personality shown in cutszenes and during the game. Something uncommon is also that you can upgrade your weapon, making it from a below average gun to your favourite tool to turn off enemies. Exactly, you are going to fight robots only except a few rare cases.  Another special feature this game has are decisionsyou have to make, and your teammates react to your decisions. they fight better if you support them, but they will fight less good and even reject orders if you ignore them. Usually this is not a big concern if you fight well.  Last but not least, let me mention the biggest enemies. I don't mean big, I mean BIG bossfights. Occasionally, you will encounter robots as large as small houses with each one require special tactics to beat them. They are challenging and fun to master. Does anyone here remember the last bossfight of Mass Effect 2?  So sum it up, Binary Domain is a well done third person shooter available for a more than reasonable price which offers 10 hours of gameplay.",

Binary Domain isnt what we used to call very good production, released by Sega, a big company, but flawed with hackards controls, high mouse accelaration and some complex game mechanics that dont benifict the overall gameplay.  It is based in interesting plot, even that at the start of the game you feel a little lost bc nothing is really explained, but the moment the game start trowing info to you, things start to make more sense.  The gameplay mechanics are weak, firing weapon doesnt feel satisfying like in other games, and the AI sometimes is little dumb, but BD can still be enjoyable bc have some good firefights and interesting concepts, like the voice command, its shame that the dev didnt explored this concept more deeply in game.  The graphics are good for its time, voice actors do their job in believable way and sound is in place, i feel that the story could be more deep about subject, but still one of the strong points of BD.  Multiplayer with friends are very fun to play, create party and have good time (pretty much what i still do with GRFS) and it may be the only option by now since public games have little players , or almost none.  Since BD is many times on sale, il recommend it because the overall experience, it worth the time invested, nothing expectacular, but a few hours of entertainement are guarantee, even for the most demanding players, i advise you to tweak the mouse accelaration for a better gameplay.",

            "review_text": "First things first.  This game has the most atrocious mouse 'acceleration' I've ever encountered. It's actually a negative acceleration. So it moves faster the faster you move the mouse, up to a point, and then it moves slower. It's the most unnatural and awkward control I've ever experienced in a shooter. You will be over-adjusting or under-adjusting your aim constantly.  This alone might be a deal-breaker for some people. After playing through the whole campaign I was able to aim pretty well but still wasn't 'used' to it. I wasn't able to find a way to disable this 'feature'.   This game is silly.  Mostly in a good way. The term 'over the top' really wasn't in the developer's vocabulary. So, this is pretty awesome for ridiculous boss fights and mayhem. Some of which made me reminiscent of old school Contra games. One thing that is obvious though is that some set pieces are stolen directly from other games/movies. The biggest offenders being a canal sequence with a helicopter dropping mines on you (HL2). And a transformer chasing you that was directly ripped from Revenge of the Fallen. And a musical piece that is a carbon copy of Mona Lisa overdrive from Matrix 2. Combat with the stock enemies is fun. Getting headshots especially satisfying. The tactical 'commands' you can give your squadmates are limited, and there were a few instances where they were very much in the way. That said, they do actually kill enemies, which is a big step up from most companion AI in a lot of shooters (which is sad to say). The microphone command feature just plain did not work for me. It may have helped with immersion if it had, but it didn't.    Characters are very much on the nose racial and national stereotypes cranked to 11. The one black character in the game had Left 4 Dead's Coach's facial model directly ripped from that game (Possibly the same actor was used... but why use such an iconic face?) and even has a line about hating stairs... Direct reference to L4D2's intro movie. Expect a non-stop stream of 'aww hell naw's from him. Americans, insistently referred to as 'Yanks or Yankees', are loud, horny, aggressive, dumb, arrogant, religious and cocky. Apply suitable stereotypes to British, French and less so to Japanese and Chinese characters... You get the idea. If I were suppose to take this game seriously, then this might be borderline offensive, or at least eye-rollingly distracting. But since everything about this game is decidedly not serious, then it actually adds to the 'charm' of the experience.    The silliness of everything meant that the potentially deep philosophical issues of machine consciousness and all the moral implications that come along with that were only superficially examined. This is kind of a let down, but if it did turn too cerebral, it would have clashed pretty violently with the tone of the gameplay/characters.   Overall it was a fun ride, marred mainly by poor control issues.  8.5/10",

Instead, I think I got one of my suprise favorite games this year.  From the get-go, you'll realize how similar it is to Gears of War. Even the font looks the same for the HUD. And you'd be partly right. It does cover-based third-person shooting pretty competently. What I really enjoy is the story. Right from the get-go, it establishes the world with its 'Hollow Children', and, oddly enough, it feels natural. Being the makers of Yakuza, a franchise well-known for its story, I'm not too suprised. Maybe what sells it to me is the voice acting. They could've sent any old B-Team dubbers to pick this up, but instead we get Grade-A performances from Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey, and Troy Baker. Really, there isn't a person I can pick that was awful. It's kind of jarring that they use Japanese dialogue for the police (Which I enjoyed) but switch him to English when he talks to the party. And Johnny Yong Bosch trying to keep an accent with that was kind of strange, but almost endearing.  But this is a game, right? You're not here for the story! You want to shoot lots of scrap-heads! And that is also a fantastic time due to the limb system. Having tactics to maybe shoot approaching robots in the legs to slow them down while shooting heads off another group to start infighting makes the fighting unique to the genre. You will fight a lot of the same humanoid bots, but there still is a suprising amount of enemy variety, not to mention the boss fights. I was not expecting so many different boss fights, but they are certainly enjoyable.    One of the main advertised features of the game was voice commands, but honestly I didn't use them. My microphone is garbage, so that might have had something to do with the game not recognizing anything. You can opt to play without it, and I didn't feel very limited. There's a simple command list for your squad that does it's job. The affection system is interesting, and I was engaged in trying to max out my teammates. That might eventually lead you to min/max that stuff, but I recommend playing it blind the first time to see what outcome you take.  On a port scale, it looks stunning. I don't know about PC controls because I'm casual scum who plays with a controller, but that in itself was an enjoyable experience. No issues with inputs and all that.  I didn't try multiplayer. I don't even know if the servers are still up at this point, or if it's local like Space Marine. Apologies.  I'm almost a little worried giving this a glowing recommendation. I went in expecting schlock (Which it does feel kind of B-Movie sometimes- in a good way), or an unplayable mess, but I got a really engaging story and really enjoyable gameplay. Pick it up, and decide for yourself.",

I shot a lot of robots in the junk; can't complain about that. The boss fights are pretty fun, although they have a tendency to stunlock you in weird ways. The main character's assault rifle is upgradeable, and I was shredding robot limbs like leafy greens on a Food Network show by the end. There were one or two 'puzzle moments' where I had to use the gun's 'bosonic charge' or whatever to break barrels that weren't having any of this 'bullet' business.   There's some squad tactics and such, but this is a mess. There's a voice command feature that is a neat gimmick for about thirty seconds, as those things are wont to be. My squadmates rarely did anything useful, and at LEAST once per encounter they decided that standing between me and the enemy was a smart thing to do. If I get good kills, they compliment me, with the same phrase ad nauseum. All of them are just-this-side-of-racist caricatures of stereotypical nationalities. The French robot in particular stopped just short of going 'oh hoh hoh' at the end of every phrase. The dialog is pretty bad, and it's delivered pretty poorly to boot. The audio in cutscenes is poorly balanced, with the dialog being drowned out by the music.   The plot is... convoluted, full of holes, and becomes utter garbage in the last act. I caught bits and pieces of it, at one point they were talking about having sex with robots, there was a cutscene where I swear a dude was feeling up a rack of servers, and in another part there was a literal triple cross. A character changed sides and then changed sides again within the span of about 2 minutes.   Binary Domain is also a pretty awful console port. The mouse and keyboard controls are okay for the most part, but they're totally busted in several sequences involving fixed guns and a 'tank' sequence I hit at one point. I was throwing my mouse across the pad 5-10 times to get my character to turn 90 degrees in any direction. The gamepad controls might be better, but it didn't work with my Xbox One controller at all. Trying to move the camera just made it spin in circles. Often times, the button prompts were maddeningly nonspecific, telling me to press a mouse button but not which one, or just showing a '[_]' icon instead of a key.   So it's a halfway decent shooter with a lot of worthless experimental elements, terrible AI, an overly convoluted story, and it's a bad port of a console game. Metal Gear Solid fans will love it!",

I would avoid this game given a second chance. Just my honest opinion, I know there are some loyal fans for this game though.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR Gameplay: Repetetive cover shooting with annoying sidecharacters with nothing good to offer. Voice recognition doesn't work. Story: Went from Interesting to dumb, fast. Over-the-top sequences made the game unbearable. Writing: Horrible.  Design: Nicely designed stages and enemies. Didn't bother playing online.  I bought this game during a sale and was reccomended saying this was an underrated game. The Cyberpunk Neo-Tokyo setting had me interested so I thought I'd give it a try  It was awful. The more I played the game the more I cared less for the game then just wanting it to end.   I learned after installing the game that the game had a mandatory voice system in order to interact with the NPCs, after configuring my microphone I only found that it didn't recognize my speech, so i just outright turned it off.  The controls are clunky. I fight the controls so many times when they automatically put me against a wall, or when I try to aim, change positions etc.  Fighting enemies we're just repetative with slight variations in enemies once in a while. Although ammo was plentiful, enemies we're simply bullet-sponges and just made the pacing bad. Just because the enemies are robots doesn't excuse this fact.   Bosses we're hit or miss. mostly miss. Some bosses had interesting mechanics but the majority of them we're 'Shoot the glowing rainbow weakspot', or 'Shoot them until they die'  I didn't bother upgrading weapons and I'm not sure nanomachines we're helpful or not. There was a bad ratio for the amount of money you'd get and how much upgrades and items cost, as money was plentiful, which eventually led me to have about 1mil by endgame.  Next, the AI of your teammates. It was outright bothersome to deal with teammates. They keep repeating the same lines over and over and keep nagging at you and pretty much make you do all the work. Even while I fire at the enemy they just move around and move in front of me as I'm firing and then I get a negative trust indicator blaming me for poorly coded AI.  Also the 'Trust system' or whatever does jack squat. All it does is make it likely that they follow your orders--which they never do regardless of how high the trust does. When saying lines like 'cover me' or 'fire' they seldom ever shoot more than 3 bullets at enemies only letting me take damage. And when you screw up, all they do is complain about how useless you are even though you we're doing all the work. I really wish you could team-kill / have an option to let them die during the game. I only felt unmotivated when having to choose partners. I just wished I could play the whole game solo.  The characters we're all so unlikeable in that there was nothing reddeming about them after all the nagging, complaining, useless dialog, boring backstories and unfunny quips. There are parts in the game where you have to rescue other memberss and I really wished there was an option to let them die and press on.   The music was really bland and overused throughout the game. Voice clips we're reused every single conflict and it only annoyed me every time I had to stop and defeat the enemies.  The story started with an interesting concept but go really poorly written as it went along. Unfortunatly talking about it would lead to spoilers, but all the 'twists' while somewhat surprisng, it's the surprise you never asked for. Also they blatantly rip off some parts of the story from other games. The progression of the characters also had some really 'jump-the-shark' moments with some really poorly written escapes and way too many plot holes and questionable events.  The only thing I really enjoyed we're the designs of bosses and the outside city. Nothing redeeming for the rest of the game whatsoever.",

What I mean by the above is this: When an engagement revolves around the use of a bullet-fed weapon, an ability to land precise hits is well rewarded. You can immobilize enemies, get quick kills, and (in the case of opponents that are carried by flight modules) very literally get 'two birds with one stone.' The ability to hone your shooting technique and get quick positive feedback makes the majority of the game quite fun.  This title isn't without its flaws, though. You're often put into spaces where your ability to be really tactical is constrained. In some cases, I felt like the camera, environment, and weapon aim were all fighting for control. Also, most of the major setpiece battles feel just a touch 'overscripted.' Your shooting prowess ceases to be front-and-center, and instead takes a back seat to just following a set of cues. There are various trust-build/ trust-loss events that seem arbitrary or unfair (which is frustrating because of their relative importance), and the quicktime events don't seem to translate well to PC controls. The non-combat, quasi-RPG, 'walk around and talk to everything' sections seem to be somewhat awkwardly tacked on, and the conversation choices are sometimes cryptic in terms of what reaction they'll prompt.  Even so, the game is entirely decent. The story presentation gets a little 'overdramatic' at times, but it's generally a good yarn that stays away from outright cheesy territory. There are some very powerful (and even disturbing) moments that make it into the narrative; the script seems to have some real depth in spots. There are also some moments that are very definitely 'action-movie cliche,' but the game IS an action movie.  A fun action movie.  With some decent plot twists.  It's all worth a try.",

Like Da Vinci painted an half of the work, then Katsushika Hokusai finished the other half, doesn't look right. But if you closed one of your eyes, one of them look good, doesn't matter which... but... for some reason, you do see a tiny bit of bad child drawing somewhere nearly hidden in the art.    Storylines:   Now the interesting aspect about what I just said, it was more like a US/UK western development started it, then was later finished by japanese development. This actually had a huge impact to its story development and characters development. Where western type of storybuilding tends to be more realism at face value with bit of hollywood action. Japanese storybuilding tends to be more about having humor and fan-service.  Those two don't mix... At all. It ruins the balance for what any gamers expect from it, wheither it's western or japanese gamer playing this. It's always going to leave a bad aftertaste once you had gone through its whole story. If you pay close attention to details, you can't help but wondering why some things in the story got so weird at times.  For this reason because western and japanese have their own storytelling media culture, completely molded into their comfort level. Without knowing what actually happened in the game development... I can only get the impression of what happened here. Maybe Sega was trying to please both sides? I don't know, but it's not good. It gave me 50/50 satisfaction through out the whole story. I didn't mean it's so-so or 'ok'... I meant half of the time is actually pretty damn good... but that other half was just sloppy. It's a pretty high contract level between the good and bad than just being bland.  I do understand japanese's culture but I felt like maybe it would be best if they didn't try to meddle with two cultures into one. It's very alienating as far it goes for my comfort level. Not forget to mention many different characters in the game are from different nations, they did try their best to retain their own culture from their own nation to justify their character development, but somewhere along the line, japanese cultures get mixed up with them. One moment, this character was acting very much like British... then next moment, acted very much like any typical japanese anime character without having to do with accepting culture nor reference to match that. So my impression was, someone created the story and then get finished by someone else, adding few more bits there and there to fill the story more.  However, it isn't to say that it doesn't have the good potential to become an very interesting franchise once they sorted out the story/gaming cultures. It could actually compete with Deus Ex and Metal Solid Snake franchise.   Gameplay:   It's... very heavily based on japanese culture type of gaming. Shoot`em-up, duck and cover, dash and roll arcadey game, commonly for pre-teens gamers. Which is a bit odd because the story aspect felt like it's for someone little older.  It works... but this game was built for console. Ported to PC support wasn't well done at all. No real graphical setting in-game, has to be set before starting the game via config window launcher. Same with control mapping. It's pitful... but it works anyway.   Recommendation:  Why do I NOT recommend this game? Well... it was actually hard to decide, still very much on the fence but sadly Steam doesn't give third 'middle' option. I flipped a coin. :/ If you don't really care about culture mash-up in the storyline and bad console to PC port. I'd say give it a try!",

            "review_text": "Binary Domain is a quite able and fun third person shooter with a initially rather campy B-Movie Plot in wich a international team is investigating a massive Bot-making corporation in a Japan that has itself isolated from the rest of the world.  There is this lauded feature that you can command your troops via your voice with the help of a microfon. Never worked but that is not a problem since giving 'commands' via the asigned buttons is more than enough. I wrote 'commands' since this is one of the games where this barely matters. Here and there you can keep the AI Companions from doing stupid ♥♥♥♥ like running into fire but i have to positively report that the Ai is mostly competent enough not to stupid things. There are some situations in the Game where it will ask you to make a decision about a tactic (my hint is to give them the order that is the last 'heroic'/stupid and suicidal) but mostly you will use this to get them to heal you with their Med Packs. You can upgrade yours and companions standart weapons and give them a few rather significant buffs to healt and damage resistance.  The design troughout is a really not bad at all. The Guns are a bit forgettable but still feel good to use.  The same can be said about the environments you are gonna traverse, a bit forgettable but still okay to look at.   The different Robotic Enemys clearly are the highlight of the Design. It looks impressive and very satisfying to partially shoot up the Bots and see them shater appart and the change their behavior depending on where you shot them at. The different Modells are very detailed albeit they are gonna repeat itself quite a lot.  The Bosses were the most interesting and ridiculous enemys to fight.  So, going on the gameplay, i would recommend this game, especially at a sale.  HOWEVER: If you are a person that things about the world and what is going on and stuff, i would recommend to pass on the last 40 to 30 minutes, beause holy ♥♥♥♥ did the story made me angry! Playing the game is supported by a story full of campy stereotypes, voiceovers and some such. These are really enjoyable in their own awfull way and caused me the one or other laugh out loud moment with how B-Movie like they were. ^-^ I have nothing against a campy story, this is also not me saying that a game like Binary Domain can't try to tell the story it does, but holy ♥♥♥♥, does it do it badly.  There is the disscussion about what makes a human beeing and what is life in regards to new kinds of high tech AI. That's a discussion you probably were awaiting when seeing the trailers and getting this game.  What i was not expecting though was a disscussion about artificial insemination and what a person born that way is worth. Again, i am not saying that this can't be disscussed, but if you disscuss themes like this you should probably DO YOUR HOMEWORK and not get into RACISSM declaring them worthless based on who are their parents. In the last 30 Years around 3 Million people have been born this way mostly to parents that were unable to concieve chilldren the normal way.  It gets even worse when the characters you have been with for some time suddenly lose the abbility to use their brains and become persons following orders for murder (till now you were only shooting Bots), characters that seconds ago stated they just want to help their children and humanity as a whole come back a sequenz later and declare they want to destroy humanity ( as you do). The whole thing keeps going with characters changing behaviour wildly and without any sense in regards to the last 10 hours of gameplay and story and the characterprogression inside of it.  All this inside of the last 10 to 20 minutes, sometimes just so you can fight certain characters.  Then comes the last of the sequences in wich NOTHING the characters do makes sense or better even LESS sense, some characters try to emulate a certain Final Fantasy 13 character just because someone things its cool or whatever and what i assume to be the president of the US declares that we don't need more racial tension on the world while practically ordering a mass suicide wich is carryied out by the UN wich apparently commands killer squads now.     Again, the gameplay is really enjoyable, and as long as you don't mind not thinking about the last hour too, much you will enjoy this game. ^-^  But the Story, the Story... by my MIND, SUCH STUPID.",

While it packed a good story i have to say that the AI of the team should be a bit more smart since this game was based on AI actions and commands i figured the AI should have been improved to new levels. The decals are very very good, you can see robot scraps everywhere after your are done with them therefore its very satisfying when putting one down. The QTE are actually quite nice, and teh boss fights are beautiful and long; i like the fact that there is a trust bar for each team mate thought i wish that trust bar would have much more value in terms of gameplay. Graphics are beautiful, and sound design is good too, I also like the OST. Overral:  * Graphics: some might consider them like an 8 but I pesonally believe that for a video game these graphics are enough.  ' Holler if you been gaming since the 90s '  * Sound: 8/10 [ It could have been better, but this depends on taste ]  * Gameplay: 8/10 Nothing New, just mow down Scrapheads but it is by no means booring. The cover system is good and realistic since things can still hit you if an inch of your arm is outside.   *** BTW Do not buy the DLCs as there isnt really any use for them since the online is on K.O mode and the DLCS only feature things like weapons and such other nonsense. ***   &lt;B&gt;I RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME BUT NOT FOR MORE THAN 10 BUCKS [ I BOUGHT THIS WHEN IT WAS AT 2.54 USD, ONE HELL OF A STEAL ]&lt;/B&gt;  ",

I mean, you get praised for acting all badass and shooting bots like a pr0 and you get frowned upon for acting like a moron, which is reflected by the raising or lowering trust that your teammates have for you. Also you get asked a lot and can reply to the conversations using your own mic, which is pretty cool. The main storyline is a typical 'go there - shoot this - omg betrayal how could you - I knew it from the very beginning though', and it sometimes gets a little bit too pompous, but in the end I liked it a lot.

I used an Xbox 360 controller, and the controls reminded me a lot of Gears of War. This title also features an optional voice command system as a way of interacting with your AI squad members. An example would be telling them to 'Regroup', or responding to a conversational prompt such as 'I like you'. I felt that this was an interesting idea, but I wasn't able to get the voice recogonition to work reliably enough with my microphone to be able to actually use it during game play. These commands/responses can be issued with button presses, so the voice recognition isn't necessary. The main weapon of each character can be upgraded (Power, Rate of Fire, etc). Each character can also socket nanomachine modules for various passive upgrades (Defense +15%, Health Regen Rate +50%, etc.). Both types of upgrades are purchased at vending machines that are placed throughout the game, and the currency is accumulated each time an enemy is destroyed.  If you play games for the storytelling and like science fiction/cyberpunk, then you might like this title. All of the enemies are robots, so I never felt that disconnect of the main character being a good guy while at the same time killing scores of people. I felt that the voice acting was well done, and the dialog was mostly good as well.  The game world is mostly urban landscapes and building interiors, and I felt that the design and detail were pretty good. I was never distracted by anything. The character models are nicely detailed, and the animations are smooth and natural looking.   Besides failing to get the optional voice recognition working, the main issue I had with this title was that there aren't separate volume sliders for music, voices and sound effects. The only way to change the voume is through the configuration tool OUTSIDE of the game, which I thought was a very poor design decision.  Overall, I enjoyed my time with this title.",

The storyline in Binary Domian is absolutely fantastic! i dont want to soil anything so i will leave it at that :P  I highly reccomend you buy this game. i would however wait untill it is on sale as i completed it in around ten hours, and for $19 it a little on the expensive side. however this does not drain any of the fun from it!",

Platinum delivers again and this is definetily worth the price tag. also on another note, if you have a mic plugged in while playing you can use voice commands to issue different commands to team mates such as cover, rush, defend while playing and your team mates will judge your command performance based on battle results and the commands you gave. this can affect their trust levels which effects other aspects of the game. you can also use voice commands when they speak to you, asking things about your personality, thoughts, feelings and so on, which can again affect their trust in as well.

You can also destroy their arm and legs. When you fight bosses there are parts you can take out to quicken the battle' as well.

The story is obviously influenced by Blade Runner and the Terminator (as are the aesthetics).  Runs somewhere between 8 and 10 hours for story mode. Worth buying, especially if it's under ten bucks.

Now we all know that Sega is very hit and miss with their products however this is definately not a miss. It is a fun fast paced 6 hour third person shooter. What makes this game so great is the enemies that you fight which are robots. Now normally in games you shoot robots and they fall down but not here. You fire your machine gun and these robots EXPLODE into bits and pieces and it is so gratifiying when this happens. Really makes you feel like a badass. The story itself is alright and voice actting is hit or miss though some of the writing has some pretty bad racial discrimination against Chinese but since it was made by Japanese I can see why. The game also includes voice commands which you can either use your voice or button commands and this is a big part of the system since there is a friendship system which does effect the ending of the game. It does work pretty well with the voice part and it is funny telling your tell 'LOVE YOU' all the time to creep them out. Anyways if you have a chance to grab this I highly recommend it if your looking for a quick action game with some playthrough.  BINARY DOMAIN RATING 8/10",

It doesn't tell you the corresponding controller buttons to perform actions. You can't even invert look (which killed it for me). It locked up the first time I started. It refuses to recognize my video card. I was fighting the up and down controls so much I couldn't tell you if the game play was good or not. I know my partner and I were nearly killed by an enemy stuck in the ground who just appeared under us in the very first section. He was literally spazzing through the polygons. All I could see were his arms and legs.  The graphics weren't great, but then again it insisted on running graphics off of my motherboard instead of video card. It looked a bit like those brightly colored 3d animation cartoons for very young children where they don't bother much with lights or shadows and everything looks very clean. I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone.
