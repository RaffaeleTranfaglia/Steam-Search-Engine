            "review_text": "  Herolike is a great idea/misguided execution game that focuses too much on being like other games in the genre but forgets to add originality. There are some interesting idea choices, such as building up your town in order to access better equipment and the like, but most of them seem half-done or unfulfilled. The RPG system in the game is simply looking at a text and selecting a response. While clunky, the combat does feel rather nice but needs a bit of tweaking here and there as it does almost become the most elaborate point-and-click game I've ever played. The one thing that the game did really well was to add a perma-death system that kept all town power-ups behind for your next characters, thus lowering the difficulty for those needing a curve.  In conclusion; Herolike is one of the most average games Steam has too offer, but don't take that as a bad thing. I think Herolike is a game that I would recommend to anyone trying to get into the hack 'n' slash genre as it is a more simplified version of games like Diablo II and Torchlight II. PIck it up now or on sale, either way is worth your time.",
