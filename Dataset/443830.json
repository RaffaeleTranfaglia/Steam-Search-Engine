I liked it. Unfortunately, the story is very short. As I was slowly progressing through story, came to an abrupt conclusion and ending. Author definitely could have worked more on supporting character development as there was a lot of potential to do so. A good buy but not a must buy.  7/10 Forced to chose side in a marital issue. Tried to not take side so they both sided against me. Mission accomplished?",
