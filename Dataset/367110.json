            "review_text": "This is a first impression. I'll update it as I get further into the game.  The game is a weird mixture of King's Quest, Wasteland (bit of Fallout in there too), Metro, etc but does a good job of being its own thing.  Combat is simple but works well and actually involves a sense of timing. You can target different parts of the body but unfortunately unlike Fallout you cannot kick a rat in the groin. There's a somewhat Stalker-esque feel to scavenging. There's even a decent crafting system. I don't know what the depth of it is yet but I was able to make some extra survival gear pretty early on.  Playing with permadeath on i made it almost an hour in and was killed by a beetle in a subway office complex. I should have turned back but decided to press on knowing what the consequences could be. The game is not easy and so far seems to make you think about what supplies you have and how far you can go with them.   There's nothing I haven't seen before, but it's not about the ingredients, it's how you put them together. So far i definitely like the recipe.",

            "review_text": "Edited review  In the initial review I got quite annoyed by bugs. Altohugh not all of them were solved, there were far less later on in the game. The fact that a developer responed is also a good thing. And in the end, I really (see under) LOVE this game. Remind me to not write a review in frustration.  BUY THIS GAME NOW. It's great, just look past a few glitches. And at this price... shouldn't complain.      First review: I really, really LOVE this game. But for now... it is not a finished game. Every 5-15 minutes something goes wrong. Mostly crashes due to inventory failures or doors that I am apparently not supposed to open. No reason to crash. A message pops up after the crashes to report to the programmers... god luck in finding out how! Then there are many items that turn red (which means they are somehow useable), but are not. Now if this happened 2 or 3 times... ok. But in 2 hours of play I've had 8 complete crashes of the game and some 10 other occurences as 'red' items that cannot be used. Feels very much in beta to me. Great potential, but unfinished. :-(",
