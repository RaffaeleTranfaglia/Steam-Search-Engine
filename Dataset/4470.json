So if you search something like a multiplaying based on servers I suggest you to get something different (I would point to Titan Quest). That's a shame because multiplaying would have been great in this game. There are also other bothering problems that you can ignore, like getting stuck in simple little rocks or can't jump down from little heights or graphic that 'is not the best'. You still can use Lan multiplay, but you have to find someone every time, which isn't so simple.",
