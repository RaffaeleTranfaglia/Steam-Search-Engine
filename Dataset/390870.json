I'm not very vocal about this, but I'm actually a big fan of top-down shooters and bullet hell games. That being said, I don't play them very often. That's why I took the opportunity to review this game, to see if it would scratch an itch left untouched for years. After playing for a few hours with friends and myself, I think this game managed to scratch that itch.   Graphics",

            "review_text": "This game is probably one of the best games on steam that throws you back into the SNES era of shooters. Not so much gameplay wise as much as graphics wise and sound. Simple and fun.  This game is very much like Smash TV (SNES game released 1991) enemies everywhere minus the power ups, but power ups collected through crystals that enemies drop. More you kill the more crystals you get the more powerful your weapon becomes and the more you kill the more enemies appear getting harder and harder till you die(big run on sentence but you get the idea). Dials back a bit when you stop killing so much.  Game gets really insane! No online multiplayer co-op yet but devs are working on it. Buy now to have a blast playing Local co-op with a friend or simply wait to buy when online multiplayer co-op releases. Either way the game is great to play give it a shot (only pun). Nice price for a great game.",
