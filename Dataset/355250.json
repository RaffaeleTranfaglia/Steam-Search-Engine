            "review_text": "TIE Fighter is one of the best games that's ever been made, but a few bone-headed decisions that went into the Steam Port make it nigh unplayable. If you have a joystick, then by all means: buy it! Otherwise... well, see below.  If you buy the game you get two separate games installed onto your computer: the Classic Version and the Collector's Edition- which has voice acting and immeasurably better graphics. The Collector's Edition will not even run unless the game detects that a joystick is connected to your computer- I don't know if it will register a USB controller as a joystick or not. The Classic version- meanwhile- runs on a hideously glitchy version of DOS Box. I played for twenty minutes before 95% of the keys on my keyboard stopped working. I had to Ctrl-Alt-Del out of the game because the Abort Mission button wasn't working. Playing the classic edition I don't believe you can adjust the mouse sensitivity and you turn so friggin' slowly using the mouse that any kind of hectic mission is unplayable.  On the bright side: if you can actually play it, this game is one of the greatest flight sims ever made. Plenty of missions, an immersive story, energy management and targetting computer systems that keep the gameplay ever-changing, and a great variety of missions. Too bad the port is so ♥♥♥♥ed up.",

            "review_text": "I remember playing this when I was young on an old IBM and even if the game has a few bugs here and there the fact I can play a game from 1994 on Windows 10 is down right amazing.   For those of you wondering and I know they haven't updated the store page yet about this but the steam version is now on par with GOG. Meaning the 1995 (DOS Collector's CD-ROM) is now included. I personally like the 1998 version as this is the one I had as a kid.  So to wrap things up when you buy this you get.  TIE Fighter - Defender of the Empire, 1994 (DOS) 1995 (DOS Collector's CD-ROM) 1998 (Windows) versions, and STAR WARS: TIE Fighter - Enemies of the Empire 1998 (Windows)  not to bad if you get it on a sale as low as $3.99",

You feel truly vunlarable and outclassed by the enemy and the only way to defeat them is outplay them. Each ship feels completely different from the last, and it includes a variety of ships from the EU such as the Tie Defender. The fun of this game comes from failing until you realize what the true objective is and the satisfaction you feel when you perfectly execute a mission and all its bonus objectives. Now with newer .dlls available the music works.  Edit: Now you can play what most people consider the best version the 1995 Collector's CD. I tried it and like it, still a bit buggy and I dislike how it doesn't recognize the throttle.",

            "review_text": "TIE Fighter is one of my favorite childhood games, so I was pumped to see it released on Steam. Unfortunately, there are some issues that keep me from recommending this verison of the game. The Special Edition has a software-enforced dead zone, so my Logitech Extreme 3D joystick is absolutely incapable of making fine adjustments. The game is unplayable as a result. The Classic Edition doesn't have this problem, if you can deal with the chunky DOS graphics.   I'm left disappointed, because TIE Fighter is truly a great game. Maybe if Steam offered the 1995 version like GOG does, I could have the best of both worlds.",

The 1994 is nearly unplayable due to graphics and doesn't include voice overs. The 1998 version is buggy and lacks the imuse dynamic music which for me was an important part of the game.   Thumbs all the way up if steam adds it!!",

            "review_text": "Great Classic and Worth Buying  I use to play this all the time when i was a kid. Played it on DOS, then got it on windows. Great game back in those days. I bought this back in december when steam had those major specials going on and it was worth it. At first it didnt come with all 3 versions of the game but since may 4th of 2016, they included the CD-ROM DOS Version as well making it total to 3 versions of the game. The X-Wing game had the same update as well. I know Good Old Games site had all 3 versions at first but when i saw this on steam for a very good price along with other games included on a special price, couldnt resist.  Does this game run on 64 bit windows? Yes it does. Ran it on Windows 8.1 64-bit and worked well without a hitch.  Having it on steam does save me all the trouble from having to rely on 3rd party programs that could manually install the game and run them on a 64 bit since the CD's Installers were not able to run on 64-bit systems.",

Be aware that you need a console control pad for this game with about 11 buttons and also note that it takes a good 10-15 miutes to set up the controls as there are over 100, most of which you dont need.   Good points-  Brilliant dogfighting  Very clear to understand once you are used to it Full simulation - almost 30 commands for squads for example but only 5 are needed Friendly wingmen are utterly deadly to other ships when directed to attack something Just like in real Star Wars, Tie fighters only take 2 shots to kill, but X/Y-wings are more durable Actually pretty good graphics on special edition. Feels like you are piloting a tie fighter  Cons-  Not easy to understand at first Difficulty is abit punishing and there are no checkpoints mid-mission ",
