I struggled with what I thought was bad collision detection on the last level, but after sticking with it for a while I got used to it and it seemed pretty fair. It requires a bit more effort than moving the sword in the direction of the attack, it's more like slashing the opponent's slash. Once I got that down the last fight was a nice tense experience.  Rather than just being able to slash whenever you want as some have suggested, I'd like to see a system that makes you think about the right time to attack, and punishes you for choosing poorly. Otherwise it would just be about spamming slashes.",

            "review_text": "Cool looking but the fighting/game itself is pretty boring as you only have 2 to 3 options where you can cut/block. It would be better if it was a full on cut and stab where you want game!!!! it's free to have a go at, so test and you might like it but it not my cup of tea.... sorry but i can recommend!!",
