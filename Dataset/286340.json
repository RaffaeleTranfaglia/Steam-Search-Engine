            "review_text": "This game is basically Minecraft but underwater. You can harvest resources like seaweed, fertilizer, dirt, sand, coal, iron, copper, gold, silver, crystals (they're just called crystals), and turn them to weapons, equipment, furniture, and buildings.   Here are the differences between Minecraft and FarSky in terms of gameplay, not art: - Your tools and equipment (including armor) never break (very handy) since you need only three primary tools - You have three main tools: knife to cut or attack, harpoon (spear) gun, and drill (to harvest and mine all available resources, including sand) - You don't have to arrange items to create items. You just need to have the minimum resources to create and you can create how ever much you want.  - Oxygen. Your character can only be outside for a limited time before you need to head back to a base to regain oxygen. It doesn't take long to refill. - Bases. You can't just build a base with sand, floors, walls, etc. You need to make an item that builds a base.  - There is a plot. Which I will explain later. - Boss battles against a mother******in' KRAKEN. If you harvest their crystal they will attack you and your base until you die. Then they leave you alone.  Here are similarities: - Hunger, if your hunger is up 100% you will start taking damage.  - Mining resources and using those resources to make tools.  - Pretty music and visuals. - Predators that attack more frequently at night. Never before had I had such sastifaction of killing a shark (an endangered species IRL). Nor the frustration of being attacked and killed by a shark (and pretty much anything that bites, stings, shocks, touches you even a little bit. - Open world exploration. You can explore deeper parts of the ocean when you have the advanced equipment to go deeper.   Plot: You are Nathan, a deep sea explorer of the coast of Austrialia, since everything underwater is out to kill you (including the jellyfish). For some reason, your submarine breaks apart into 9 pieces that scattered across the map. Your task is to get back all those parts and survive. You will have another researcher that will guide you and help you (a little bit). For the most part, you jump into the game with little to no help. Once you collect the 9 parts, you instantly rebuild your submarine and you can take it to the surface where you beat the game.  Once you beat the game, you can play sandbox mode.  What's missing: - Bed or something to make it speed up time until morning. - Some kind of radar to detect enemies. You can get attacked at all sides and no idea where they are coming from, how many, then you die. - More story or tasks. I like that there is something more than surviving. Maybe look for lost treasure or something. - More creative ability like in Minecraft to build and do whatever you want.  8/10.",

It had much potentional; howbeit when the game was Greenlit, everything had been rushed and from what I believed to be.... incompleted. Through out the time things were being added &amp; taken away. Many of the things taken away were very valuable pieces that would've brought this game to life. The bosses, the oil resource, the leveling up, &amp; etc were taken out. I hope Tim Speckler the developer would complete this game just as it rightfully deserves to be completed. As for comparing to Subnautica, well Subnautica had a whole crew whereas Farysky was a one man army deal, plus Farsky came out before Subnautica. Well, that's my two cents.",

            "review_text": "It's horrifying to think that although humans rule the earth, we are totally outclassed in the sea. This is the pivot that FarSky works on. You are a survivor of a submarine crash and need to survive long enough to retrieve the pieces of your craft and make it to safety.  You learn to watch your oxygen. Your hunger. Your injuries. Depth. Daylight. Materials. Predators. There's a tight little game here.  Unfortunately the experience is a little shallow. Building your base is fun, but beyond the crafting tables and a small crop of vegetables, there's not a lot to do. Exploration is mandatory and soon enough you get into the gameplay loop of guessing when it's dawn, scooting out to find a little more resources, or travel a little further down. The world is procedurally generated, so that's both fun and frustrating in equal measures.  It's probably a nice game to play for a weekend. Music is nice and the graphics are at times stunning despite their simplicity. With a little more gameplay or variety, this could be quite a refreshing alternative to Minecraft, but lacks the complexity and creativity.",

            "review_text": "I bought FarSky on a whim. I had some extra cash to spare and the concept of the game looked compelling enough for me. Since I've finished the initial 'campaign mission'/'adventure mode'. I think I'm qualified to review the game.   GRAPHICS (9/10):  I was hooked by the graphics in FarSky. I'm serious, the game looks great. It doesn't sink into the 'box/block aesthetic' that most voxel-based sandbox survival games like to fall into. For a game built on Java, it looks pretty fantastic. If there's anything that this game does great it's the graphics. It's appropriately minimalistic when it needs to and appropriately detailed when it needs to. No two landscapes look the same, and while there are certain patterns as to where things appear—these patterns never look too obvious.  While textures might fade in and out sometimes—the game's still in a early dev stage and it's probably a problem that will be fixed later in a patch or something.    SOUNDTRACK/SOUND EFFECTS (7/10):  The music does a good job in setting a tone for the game. A good word to describe the soundtrack for the majority of the game is 'melancholic'. It's peaceful and it's never too distracting. I would however, hope for more suspenseful tunes for the game during moments where the player is in trouble.   Sound effect wise, the game is pretty quiet. Whilst the game itself is understandably quiet (it's set underwater...and sound doesn't travel well), the lack of sound effects make the game sometimes feel boring. I'm not saying that the game should be a smorgashboard of sounds—but it would be nice if we heard the occaisional whale call or maybe the periodical breathing of our main character. Or maybe even a low and steady hum of the drill you use.    CONTROLS (8/10):  FarSky's your bog-standard survival/voxel-based game. It handles a lot like MineCraft. I'd say that it does a pretty good job at what it's supposed to do—only for a few issues.   1) In other games of similar nature, you're usually allowed to right click on resources or to split resources the way you want them. In FarSky, you can only fill a certain resource up to the maximum amount and that's it. There are no 'resource distribution' controls built in the game and that can be quite frustrating.  2) The swimming mechanics are kind of clunky. And for some reason—you can't crouch! I'm hoping that the 'no crouching' problem could be fixed later in DLC.   GAMEPLAY (7/10):  For what it has so far, it's pretty good. I mean, it's fun. And it will definitely kill six hours (that's how long it took me to beat the first 'adventure mode') and the game has everything that it's advertised to have. You can build bases underwater, you can mine for resources underwater, you can hunt for fishes...et, cetera. There's nothing missing!  But while it's everything it's advertised to be, there aren't enough features! I'm hoping that the devs release periodic updates a la Minecraft and allow for modding support, because this game needs more content to kill more than six hours! I'll probably revisit the game sometime later, but the lack of content is kind-of a turnoff. You'd think that a game that focuses heavily on underwater exploration would have more stuff to explore right?    OVERALL (7.5/10):  I don't regret purchasing FarSky. But I just want more content. I don't care if the devs don't fix the 'no crouching' problem, I just want more music, more sound effects and more gameplay elements.   As of the time I'm writing this review, this game is on sale—and it's worth the buy right now. That's if the devs add stuff. If they don't add any new features within the next few months following the posting of this review. Don't buy the game. But if you're going to buy the game now, buy it—it's worth it. And at the very least, it will kill 6 hours of your time.   ",

The reason is simply because of price and content, this game cost's the same price as Subnautica and yet it does not have anywhere near as much content to boot. Subnautica is a game that I highly recommend but far sky isn't. If far sky goes on sale for a cheap price then sure go buy it but if it doesn't, get Subnautica instead. Also think about this. Subnautica is in early access and far sky is 'finished' and yet Subnautica has way more content, just let your brain process that.

Sure you could stay behind and hunt down the ore needed for tier 3 armour and farm resources to create a bigger base but what for? There's no secrets or anything worthy of finding besides the underwhelming kraken and the resources he guards. If you do find yourself exploring you'll soon find there's no penalty to dying making enemies non threatening and the air and food gauge pointless.

I tend to play horror games a lot also so when they are combined (like in 7 days to die) there is a good formula for a game. But as far as horror games go no amount of zombies or mutilated aliens or jump scares or screaming bloody murder is truly scary. The reason being is that games and movies have been all over those settings for a long time, and they have become a big repetitive. Zombies, aliens, obscene amounts of gore, thats old material.

FarSky takes advantage of these fears, and combined with it's unique setting makes for a perfect formula of a game that fulfills the void left by the fact that there has not been any kind of game like it. Deep ocean has got to be the best grounds for a survival game there is. I just finished the game and have got to say it was fun, really fun, especially when I was running (swimming) for my life trying to get into my base before a shark ripped my arm off.

Knowing that a piece of glass was all that protected you from an infinite expanse of your worst childhood nightmares was nice feature, and Jumping off an undersea cliff really gave me a feeling of adventure. Also it got me immediately thinking about all the horrible sea monsters that could be below me, which got me thinking I need to get back to my base and go back to that feeling of safety that felt so good.

You can easily gather enough resource to craft a rediculous amount of high tier object which only means you need and insanly large storage facility to store them as there is not enough object variety to craft that would warrent being able to deplete your large resource stockpile. Even the high tier items are limited to being about maybe 10 things in total. The map, while randomly generated is actually small it takes about a minute or so just to cross from one end to the other, even going to the lowest depth possible isn't very rewarding as it is pretty much like the top level, lots of light with lots of undersea plants. If your looking for a game that is good for killing small amounts of time then this game might be for you if your willing to pay $15 for what little you get.

First and foremost my save game became corrupted after 3 hours of playing, and that did it. There's lost of other bugs in this game, like sharks spawning out of nowhere next to you and killing you in one bite, bugs in crafting and so on. Feels like an Early Access pushed out because the developer got bored or something.   Secondly, the whole concept if this game is ridiculous and perverted. I wanted to say that the author has no understanding of even the simplest concept of school-level physics, but it is much more worse - they do not even understand how water and swimming works, least of all, how swimming under the water might be working.  The whole game is based on the premise that the protagonist's submarine is broken (in pieces, no less) and so they are stuck underwater, because they cannot JUMP high enough to reach the surface! So we have to craft a base to survive underwater and actually go DEEPER to gather pieces of the broken up submarine, so it can bring us back up and above. Because, I repeat, when you are deep underwater, you can only walk and jump and hold that electrical thing that moves you fast. But it can't move you to the surface either. Not to mention that we're walking and jumping at depths that would be completely rid of color and light, and not survivable by a human on it's own, but that just some geek details, right?  Maybe I am so picky about this because I have over 40 dives logged, but with all the bugs this is beyond ridiculous.  ",

Other than being a companion, he didn't really do anything for me.  A frilled shark chased me from 100 m to 300 m as I plunged desperately for a submarine piece. This is an issue as enemies will NOT stop chasing you unless you get back to base, so if you don't have a weapon you're pretty much screwed.  The game gets the atmosphere done pretty nicely though, which I definately think is one of the stronger parts of this game. Also, the survival mode where you only have one life might provide a little challenge for people looking for a pretty difficult survival game, making each encounter with sharks and barrucadas a scary event, and harvesting potatos and fish absolutely essential.",

Yes, there's still another 2 modes, but they'll be much the same, and there's no reason to build a massive base, because you can build so little.  It's an interesting idea, but not fully executed I don't think.  On a side note, the graphics are a tad bland as well...

You access the crafting table and choose the item you want, if you have the correct ingrediants in your inventory, the item is instantly made.   None of the items are complicated at all. Use 20 copper ore, 2 gold, and POOF, you have an underwater scooter. There is no refining of minerals, there is no crafting of smaller components to later build a more complicated item.  Also if you want to build something , but don't have the ingrediants it will show you tiny little icons of what you need, but it doesn't say what those icons are. For example I needed to make a bandage to stop my bleeding, and it needed seaweed, but the icon didn't look like seaweed and I could find anything that I was harvesting that had an icon that looked like the one shown.  One last thing about the crafting. The ore to mine is everywhere. You are litterly surrounded by it. There is more ore around you then just regular stone.  Graphics... The game looks very beautiful lots of underwater eye candy, The best part of the game is the look and feel of your surroundings.  Sound... Sound isn't too bad, but when night comes you get some fairly bad music start to play. seems like they were trying to copy minecraft here, but where mine craft music is peaceful sounding, this music doesn't give me that feeling.  The combat is also pretty week. The fish AI is basically always the same from every fish...charge at you at high speed straight on.  This game could have been so much better, but it feels like a game that is still in Alpha, but it is a finished game.   ",

In fact There are less then 40 recepies(Minecraft has almost 100 or maybe more).  The bigest problem though is the exploration, The player is always limited to maximum presure of used diving suit, What realy hurts is that one ore that is required to make better helmets for presure resistance almost always spawns in tons just a few hundred meters below the starting depth tolerance. This forced me to restart a game more times then i can count.   Another isuee is the day and night mecanic. In minecraft it was a chalange becouse monsters could find you. Under the sea though predators(Sharks are the only mob that atacks on sight) find you in about 30 seconds after nightfall,  The only thing to do is to jump yourself al the way back to your base,(No running mecanic is present and walking is limited becouse of the legendary invisible walls). And it seems inside it even a nuke couldent hit.  NPC's just circle it blainlesly. It looks nice, but after 10 minutes of night with a moran shark doing 360's around your house you just get sick of it. The only thing capable of killing during the night is death from starvation. ",

Gather, once you get an extractor you’ll get more materials then you will ever need. Crafting could be expanded, many of the things you can build you never really need. Building stuff from chests makes crafting them unnecessary. Food options are nice but end the end I was just living potatoes. As for replay, its there. There is a Survival mode that can be challenging, for a little while. Me I will try playing it by avoiding chests and only eating fish. Andof course I can also see the charm of just building bases.

They are just plain beautiful, breathtakingly so at times. The presence of a story with an overarching goal that gives some background is a nice touch that is missing from far too many sandbox style games (even though the story in this game is completely contrived, you're only down maybe 300-400 feet yet they have no way to rescue you so you have to fix your sub...). I like the resource gathering system with automated extractors and mostly unlimited resources once you find suitable deposits.  Unfortunately, this game also has some major issues and really falls short of being a great game and ends up being merely mediocre and not worth the asking price.  First off, although the adventure mode has a basic tutorial built in, it misses some key points that sent me to the wiki to figure out how to play the game.  There's also several game mechanics more or less copied wholesale from minecraft that have no place in this game. This is a near future sci-fi game, why do I have to mine coal to cook my food!?! At night, the predators hunt you down from a mile away, but completely ignore you in the daytime. I've never seen them even try to catch any of the numerous other fish that are more appropriate for their size. At least the penalty from dying is minimal, all your stuff is put in a chest and you get a death marker so you can swim back and retrieve it.  Base building is a lot more difficult than it should be. Your base can take damage from a boss enemy, but the tool to repair the damage is the same as the removal tool, so if you accidentally click on a part that's NOT damaged it's removed and you often have to go outside the base to replace a floor panel you accidentally removed while inside.  Probably the biggest reason why I can't honestly recommend this game at the asking price is that there really isn't much content here. I played through the story for the first time with having to look through the wiki in under 2 hours, and in that time I was able to get the highest tier equipment. The simplistic base building mechanics mean that there's not really much interesting you can do as far as base building (other than trying to reach the surface by building your base up to it I guess) and the lack of multiplayer kills a lot of the replay value.  Overall, a beautiful game that sadly falls short of its potential.",

This feat can be accomplished in around an hour and im sure you could do it in less if you tried. Aside from the lack of content a great game with nice visuals and predators that will cause you to, on occasion, lose your cool as you have no idea where the hell that Kraken came from.    Overall a 6/10 Would be more if there was more to do.   Would recommend only if on sale as £10.99 is a extraordinary price for a game witch I felt was worth £5.00 or less.",

While Farsky is simplistic and visually pleasing, the game itself lacks content ranging from a limited map all the way to the not so wonderful ending. To avoid spoilers I won't discuss that even though there is not much to go into detail about. The game itself takes about 3-4.5 hours to complete at max if you don't really know what to do at the beginning. I have been watching this game for some time for updates but the forums are spot on about one thing: The development of this title is almost nearly abandoned.   I would reccomend this game if: ~ You buy it during the winter or summer sales ~ Like the simplistic crafting experience while dodging a small array of enemies at night ~ Need to blast a couple hours ~ Can stab fish and they explode in a cloud of blood and a fish fillet that could be lightly fried.  Why I currently do NOT reccomend this: ~ The current price of $9.99USD is overpriced for this little content ~ Nothing to do but restart the game after story completion ~ Lack of content = Lack of replayability ~ Development has ceased, no new updates coming in from the looks of it ~ Not many modes of gameplay to keep interest  Date of Review: 03/30/2016 ",

Combat's what you'd expect, nothing overly spectacular. You can pretty much kill anything with the same technique. My only quarrel is that it didn't really have much to offer after you'd maxed your gear, crafted all the shiny stuff, and completed the adventure mode, which can be done quite easily in about 4-5 hours. Overall if you're looking for something that's short and sweet, fairly immersive and not overly fast paced than this game is going to be the way to go. If you're looking for something with a bit more to keep you entertained in the long run, then at the moment this probably wouldn't be the best option.

At the same time, the constant pressure of the depleting air tank, Nathan the Diving Man's stomach, and all of the pretty sea creature who want to murder the heck out of you keep the game from being a walk in the park.   This is not a long game, nor is it a particularly difficult one. Taking even basic precautions should keep you from getting eaten and skilled survivor gamers will probably be able to beat both Adventure AND the more difficult Survivor mode in just a few hours.

I've red through the community forums about how to fix this problema and have tried every trick in the book and it seems like my specs are good enough to run the game...well they're supposed to be anyway and yet nothing works. I can't get the blasted thing to run no matter how hard I try, it was simply luck for me that i bought this game when it was on sale for 3 dollars or i'd be severly disappointed right now because this game seems like it would be fun and interesting if i could only get it to run. So there you have it my review of the game, If you are interested in playing but don't know if it will even run on your computer then please do what I did and wait for a sale that way if it doesn't run then at least you won't be too terribly heart broken because you spent good money on it.",

I was looking for a survival game that wasn't such a horror bomb, so I found Farsky.   I've exhausted the story mode now, and I've got to say, in overall, this game is nice. It isn't anything revolutionary but it's NICE. If you're looking for a way to kill time, Farsky is a quite the pretty thing to help you with that.  The graphics ARE beautiful and unique and the sceneries throughout the game really catch your eye.   The story in the other hand isn't such a charmer, pretty much the basic stuff, BUT it fulfills it's duty. The plot works with the gameplay, so no big complaints made here. The exploration too starts to repeat itself after a while, but the game is fairly short, so this won't be a big problem either if you beat the game as I did: Basically by running it through.   The only big minus that I have for the game, is for the beginning of it. You'll really grow to enjoy this game, but at first it is very hard to get hang of ANYTHING since there is absolutely NO TUTORIAL in the game.  Yeah, one might say discovering things in games like this is point of this genre, but I think that it's a pity that there is absolutely no guidelines at all for those who have never played games like these. I am making a point here, since I was on the verge of quitting the game in my frustration at first too. I am not the kind of person that likes googling walkthrough-stuff, but then...  Who does?",

I actually got this because I WANTED a short,focused undersea game as I find I don't currently have enough time to dedicate to the much larger in scope Subnautica. Even knowing what to expect I find this game to have a massive lack of content. I completed the story mode (such as it is) in an hour and a half. This unlocked survival mode but I see no reason to play again as I had obtained everything there is to obtain in that brief 90 minute playthrough. I recall when this was in early access and it seemed promising,if not as graphically splendid as subnautica. Clearly it has been rushed and abandoned. Such a shame really.",
