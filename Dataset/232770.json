There are a certain number of hostiles on the level, for example 49. You may have to kill 80% of hostiles. Once you kill 40 of the 49 hostiles, you are at about 80 or 81 percent, and you are allowed to advance to the next level.  10/10 would recommend to school teachers to help teach percentages",

I have to say that i liked this old school game and reminded me of the 1st GTA.  + Funny. (Check some advertise in game and you will know what I mean) xD + Kill everything. + Ostrich! (You will know what I mean when you play it). + Arcade Style.  - No Plot. - Got stuck on 1st Level because i didn't know where to go. (You have to press F1 when the objective is complete) - Always the same objective. (Kill XX% of enemies). - It's annoying when you don't want to kill civilians and yet they just 'suicide' running to you while you are trying to shoot enemies xD (Just not killing civilians for achievement...) - Rocket Launcher dudes super annoying when you get hit once and while getting up get hit again and again... till you die. (You can crouch but only after you get up).  The presence of a moving van on the first level suggests that the character has been evicted from his home and is 'going postal', but there is no story evolution during the game, you just kill as much as you want... However there are some quotes from some kind of diary.  Don't think it's conected to Postal 2, but I had fun playing.  Anyway... Remember this is just my opinion, some of my (+) can be a (-) to you and viceversa. It depends from player to player. Also I'm sorry for my English. (I'm Portuguese). Hope my review was helpful to you! :D",

As a big fan of isometric games, i support postal cold hearted. Its a very well crafted game for its time. I would say this game isnt for every modern gamer but for gamers who approcate the simple feel of gaming of yester years. The dumb AI is expected but also not much of a hinder for this game. The graphics though very dated retain a hand drawn aesthetic. As a artist i can judge the art of this game very harshly, but ill say the artist who did the scenes wasnt a top tier artist (Not saying i am myelf) but one will still apprecite it none the less.   At heart i enjoyed the short romp through and the game was definitly worth the playthrough, even with the psychopath theme to it, which many will be put off by. killing innocent npc's in game feel some what wrong to me, but hey thats gaming for you.",

I'm disappointed they decided to ditch some of the classic features that added to the feel of the game. I'd rather have the original feel over improved controls / graphics.

The control were somewhat tricky for me at first but within about half a minute i got used to them. Also if you dont like the game because of a reason like to much killing, or to violent, you just need to grow a pair of balls. Its just a game, and after the credits (I only watched them all for the achievement) it says not to do this in real life (as if they need to tell you that).

The game is exactly as it was back in '97 just with a bit of tweaking to run on modern systems, so don't be all too mortified by the chunky visuals and horrendous aiming (the mouse AFAIK only rotates Postal Dude, it does not actually allow you to point and aim).  I'd mainly reccomend Postal to those who played the game back in the day, curious about the grim and gritty beginnings of the Postal, or take enjoyment in playing archaic-as-hell PC games like I am.",

The Police and gangs of the City aren't much better than him, they attack the Dude before he even opens fire and sometimes end up killing innocent civilians, there truly is no hero in this story. In terms of Gameplay everything takes place in either a top down or isometric perspective (depending on the Level) with the Dude having to use a bunch of different Weapons including Shotguns, Machine Guns, Napalm Launchers and more to take out a percentage of armed 'hostiles' on the Level with civilians being optional targets. After the goal is met the player simply presses the F1 key and moves on until all the Levels are completed. The Gameplay is fun but gets rather boring after a while especially since the enemies have a lot of Health. The controls also feel stiff and awkward due to the fact that the Dude will respond to the pressing of movement keys differently depending on the direction he is facing, this the Game even less fun to play than it already was and it's honestly not worth getting anymore since the remake (POSTAL Redux) has been out for a while now, get that instead!",

Say what you want about the series' tendency to dial it to eleven, here it ♥♥♥♥ing works.  Unfortunately the gameplay is 1996-style isometric bullcrap. You spin your character around to shoot the bros, take cover when they are shooting at you. There are civilians and it doesn't matter whether you shoot them or not, you just have to kill the ones with actual weapons. So the big darkness the Postal Dude is fighting is other people with guns, because he should have all the guns and not anyone else!

The game is an isometric shooter with buggy hand drawn environment, extremely janky controls and poor semi-scripted AI.   That said, the weapon variety is rich and the maps are interesting. Most importantly, it actually feels fun to 'outsmart' the dumb AI by shooting enemies that are stuck in the scenery or cannot see you and to trick them into blowing up and burning each other. It's a bit weird thing to say, but, as it turns out, the game's biggest appeal lies in its shortcomings.  Despite the fun factor, I would not recommend the game to myself, had I not played it a long time ago. The reason for this is that I'm not feeling comfortable with such level of violence anymore. I'm OK with some cartoony murder of faceless low-poly clones, but when the police ladies you have to kill start screaming in agony for half a minute and the game has a dedicated button for putting dying people out of their misery, that's a bit over the line for me.  On top of this, the game crashes quite frequently, which may be very frustrating when it happens after nearly completing a level. I don't recall this being a problem with the original game, so there must be something wrong with the revamped Steam version.  If the excessive violence, low resolution and general instability do not turn you off, however, you may have some good fun with the game, especially on the hardest difficulty (which is really not that hard, once you get used to the controls and the pacing).",

The guy is crazy and one fine winter day goes out and starts forbidding to cut the neighbors came out on the porch to get some fresh air, janitors, clearing the snow in the yards, salesmen pushing the next irons Turbonegro, police, happily zdorovaemsya with all the counter — in General, anything that can walk and talk. Throughout the action, the main character visits different locations of the city and commit a massacre over the counter. In the case that the position is hopeless, the main character has the ability to shoot himself in the head. The game was banned for sale in all civilized countries of the world. Of course, she was the wildest popular in the most spiritual country in the world — Russia.  (Русский) Это самый беспредельный экшен, где можно просто беспричинно убивать всех подряд. Postal представляет собой изометрический 3D-шутер, хотя некоторые уровни представлены видом сверху. Игра имела довольно простую суть — в голове главного героя игры, называемого Postal Dude ( Поехавший чувак), начинает говорить голос. Парень сходит с ума и в один прекрасный зимний день выходит на улицу и начинает невозбранно выпиливать соседей, вышедших на крыльцо подышать свежим воздухом, дворников, расчищающих снег во дворах, коммивояжеров, толкающих очередные утюги с турбонагревом, полицию, радостно здоровающуюся со всеми встречными — в общем все, что умеет ходить и говорить. На протяжении всего действа, главный герой посещает разные локации города и учиняет расправу всем встречным. В случае, если положение безвыходное, главный герой имеет возможность выстрелить себе в голову. Игра была запрещена к продаже во всех цивилизованных странах мира. Разумеется, она стала дичайше популярна в самой духовной стране мира — России.",
