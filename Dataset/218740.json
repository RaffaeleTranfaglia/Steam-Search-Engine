During my gameplay i often found myself comparing it to the Portal games in the way that you have to think outside the box in order to properly get through each puzzle they throw at you, during the game you are given small quantities of items ment to aid you along your way, i often avoided using these items whenever i could because they didn't quite fit my gameplay style but none the less they were unique enough to give each one it's own purpose!  side note: Not once during the game did i feel like i was lost or didn't know what to do, the game was fairly straight forward in letting me at least know my final destonation  Pros: -Soundtrack -Creativity -challenge  Cons: -Quick changes from avoiding easy enemies into challenging boss fights -Often requires quick reactions in order to stay alive -(SPOILER ALERT) after the final boss fight i was annoyed to find myself having to make a near flawless run across a changing foreign landscape in a timely manner   the third boss i think i found most difficult i knew what i needed to do for most of the fight it was just the exicution i found most dificult, timing the jumps and getting accurate item placement was a huge challenge in such a time crunch",

            "review_text": "Pid is a game that is seriously at odds with itself. On one hand it wants to be an atmospheric and dreamy little puzzle platformer that has great sense of style and a fun take on traversal, and on the other it wants to be a masocore platformer, killing you over and over again until you get it right. These elements unfortunately never come together. It feels like two entirely different games shoved into a room and told to play nice, but they never really want to.   Pid's strong suit is its take on using gravity to get yourself around the world and using it to solve simple room puzzles to progress. When the game sticks to that, it's fun, and as it tucks more and more items into your inventory to play around with, the mechanics can get quit advanced and demand a lot of your critical thinking and reflexes. When the level design allows for creativity in passing obstacles with your collected items, Pid excels head and shoulders above most puzzle platformers.  The parts of Pid that are out for your blood however really drag the game into the mud. When the game decides to go all 'Action Game' mode, you're being asked to perform tasks that the laboured character movement, weapons that are needlessly hard to work with, and weak jumping arc simply can't provide. Enemies in this game work better when they're used as obstacles or a means to complete a puzzle.   When on display, Pid's amazignly realized world, fantastic jazzy soundtrack, and fun gravity puzzle mechanics are when it feels truly alive and sure of itself. Real shame about those parts that don't work, though.",

The game has a simplistic story, but the presentation is pretty good. I have only played a short while, but what I have played so far is good. It seems to be a platformer with emphasis upon puzzles over action... at least at this point. While my PC can play it, it doesn't run the game at a very good FPS, even on low graphics settings, it does at least playable. I do feel like my PC should be able to run this game at a higher frame rate, but I've seen much worse. So, I'd say the optimization could be better, but is not horrible. I have tagged this game to play more in the future when I have a faster computer. The graphics are pretty cute and have a certain charm about them. The presentation is good. There are some characters who speak by means of text and gibberish which sounds like a foreign language. I believe the Zelda games may have used this method in the past. I believe it is effective and is much better than mere text.",

You can only buy two bombs and they’re pricy. The game goes smoothly. Artwork is great. The key is free which makes it a better game for me XD.",

Something about the level design feels clumsy as though the developers were not quite sure what to do with the mechanics. It's alright but after BC: Rearmed I was expecting another classic which it definitely isn't. Looks and sounds great but is ultimately underwhelming.",

It would seem that the game has all the groundwork to become one of the best platform games of the year: the amazing beauty of the location with a common technology of everyday life, interesting, albeit slightly crazy characters, exciting battles with the bosses and original gameplay ideas. Pid - This visually beautiful platformer with a heap of interesting gameplay ideas. Only here it is banal uncomfortable to play.  ★★☆ of ★★★★★",

            "review_text": "Pid has all the makings of a game I would enjoy, but it falls short in so many places. It wants to be a puzzle platformer, but the puzzles are too simple to be challenging, and the controls are too squishy to platform. The controls are especially frustrating during boss fights.  I think it was about the second boss fight where the game really started to go off the rails for me. Everything up until that point made sense within the world and lore of the game, but the second boss is just completely ridiculous for no reason. There isn't even any reason for him to be there story-wise. It's just something that happens to annoy you.  Also, some sections require exploration and a lot of backtracking, which I normally don't mind for something like a metroidvanian game, but with Pid it's just tedious.  I think this is my main problem with Pid. A lot of the design choices seem to artifically lengthen the game for no reason.  I haven't beaten it yet, and I'm doubting I will, because after an obnoxious scavenger hunt section, I was rewarded with an hour of wandering aimlessly in a level literally called 'Maze'. It's just another example of how the game likes to grind its gameplay and story to a halt so you're forced to spend more time with it.  It's really outstayed its welcome for me.  EDIT: I finally got through the maze, and now there's a chase sequence. This game has lost all its charm for me. The controls are ~not~ tight enough to do the kind of platforming it requires. I'm done with it.",

            "review_text": "I don't remember, maybe 1 month ago i got this game.  I start the game with the super simple main menu i have seen in my life. So I and my sister play this game. The art look very good, sound is ok. The first impression really not bad. I love the idea about beam that the core feature of the game. Yeah so this puzzle mechanic is very unique. We enjoy the game after the first boss. I realise there're so many problems with the game. The controll system sucks, and i have to change the key blind again when i restart the game. When play 2-players mode, each player can just use 1 beam (single player allow people to play 2 beams) which make the game need teamwork in this mode. However, something wrong like, if just 1 player can get out the area, both 2 will get out the area which make the game less challenge in this mode. And i think the boss have a bad design at all. There're some large area in this game that i think should show the minimap because it look very hard with casual player to navigate. The story is ok. After all, the beam is the cool thing, the bright point at this game. Too bad, there're so many bugs (sometimes i can just say 'WTF just happend'), lot of issue, bad controll system. Maybe some people wouldn't mind and can enjoy this game. This game just not a good gem for me.  4/10 :(",
