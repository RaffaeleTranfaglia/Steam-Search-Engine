            "review_text": "This is a poorly balanced mashup of FTL-like exploration with HOMM-style turn-based combat. It hides its incredibly unforgiving randomness behind the disclaimer of 'Roguelike,' yet it provides little sense of progression or accomplishment.  Grinding is the name of the game here. You'll spend the first several hours fighting the same 3 enemy types - wolves, guardsmen and thieves - over and over as you run through the same scripted scenario over and over. The environment becomes tiresome and repetitive very quickly. The points of interests that you'll come across aren't interesting at all. Most of them provide some a generic text description before presenting a single 'Search' option. They'll either provide loot or do damage to your party.  The mechanics of combat are simple, and there is very little depth to the tactical nature of the combat. This makes each run-through (and eventual death) flat and uninspiring. I do not feel as though I have learned anything from that run-through which will aid me in the next. I am left with the feeling that I merely ground out a little bit more xp to become numerically stronger, to get a little bit further when I play the same series of events and combats over again.  The made-for-mobile interface is reasonably polished and makes this experience less painful than it could have been.  The idea of FTL with turn-based party combat is a good one. Unfortunately, this is not the game to do it justice.",

            "review_text": "I can recommend Crowntakers on sale. It just doesn't have the longevity to justify the full price.   Pros: - Turn-based combat on a hex grid. It functions as you'd expect and is largely entertaining.  - Good aesthetic. Roguelites aren't always colorful or easy on the eyes, but this one certainly is.  - Strong upgrade system. You can find some really cool stuff that has a huge impact on how you approach battles. This ties into a con below, unfortunately.   Cons: - Not balanced. Drops and store items are randomized, but not remotely equal. What you get and when has a *huge* impact on the difficulty of the game. One item (the book of bluffing) allows you to skip almost all of the combat in the game and gets you out of nearly every negative random event.  - No need to rush. The game claims enemies get stronger depending on how long you take, but after a deliberately slow playthrough, I am unconvinced. It does not seem to have a counter for taking your time and grinding powerful items. The attempt is giving you a 'bad' victory if you take more than 18 days, but considering I won easily at 20 days making absolutely no effort to hit the deadline, I don't think it would be terribly difficult to reach the 'true' ending with a similarly laid back approach. - Enemy AI is moronic. It targets your units without regard to the damage incurred from doing so, for which units are likely to die if attacked, or for setting up its own counterattacks. Enemies love to set up overwatch in areas you'll never enter or guard on their second turn for no reason at all.  - Huge repetition of enemies. Ignoring bosses, there are all of 4 units in the royal army (of which I only saw 3 multiple times), 5 animals (3 recolors), and 2 alternate factions, both of which appear to only have one unit with minor variations. It's not enough to stay interesting over 7 areas.  - Few interesting random events. Crowntakers is clearly inspired by FTL, but where that game had different events at nearly every stop, this game instead offers you the same choices at nearly all stops, and Search (2h) is almost always the right one. What events there are have often entirely unpredictable consequences and lead to fights or damage for no reason at all. The characters and items required for special choices are often unclear and are never shown unless you have them.   Crowntakers is a great idea that unfortunately did not translate into a great game. My three hours played were enough to beat the game once and see *many* of the random events multiple times in spite of how rare it is to get one.",

            "review_text": "Its pretty fun in short bursts. Just a simple turn based Roguelike with some persistent stats in the starting game mode. The graphics are neat, the art style reminds me of an older Disney cartoon movie, like the Sword in the Stone. The music is appropriate kind of cheerful fantasy style.   The controls are entirely mouse driven, and easy to use.   It has an option for a controller, but I cant get it to work, and I have no idea why you'd use a controller for this game. Trust me, I have a physical disability, and have to use a controller for most M&amp;K based games that rely on realtime keyboard for movement and mouse for options/looking around. I'd be the first to be asking for controller support if the game needed it. This one doesn't, but has it.  The full review: The help files suck and I still dont know what all those symbols with the hand and arrow on the right hand side does (Hold in inventory, give to someone, drop?)Theres not to much in the way of deep tactics, but its entertaining.   Basically, you move around a hex board. You choose the direction you go, and then you walk to the next crossroads. Sometimes theres a place you can interact with (search a cottage, visit a merchant or blacksmith, an inn, cave , a fight ect). Random events happen at these places. Usually searching for small items, but other things such as HP or gold gain/loss, or nothing at all   The blacksmith and inn are used to improve your weapon/armor, buy things, rest and buy food, hire mercenaries. To improve your weapons you need to buy or loot a certain item shown in your inventory screen then take that item to the blacksmith and pay a fee. The item is upgraded. Then you take armor/weapon runes and put them in the slots you get from upgrading. The runes have different effects, and are swappable but only armor runes work with armor and vice versa.   Mercenaries are the people you hire at the inn to help you fight. They can gain XP and some of their their XP is persistant even after you die. So they get better and better as you go. Every mercenary is slightly different. I have found an archer and a fighter. Each character has 2 special skills they can use to help them in battle, and they are all different for each mercenary that Ive found so far.  There is a day/night cycle and after every 24 hours (shown in the lower left corner) the enemies get stronger a bit. So you have to balance searching everything and getting to the end of the map. The maps are random for each playthrough, so you dont know where everythings going to be.   Fighting is done on a turn based hex grid. Its simple. Move, attack, and choose facing. The arrow that is yellow instead of red is the chars back. Backstabbing does extra damage so facing matters. There is permadeath, so when the hero dies, you have to start again. Your mercenaries keep their XP (depending on gameplay mode), though, so its not like everythings completely lost.    Seems like itd be really fun on a phone if I was stuck waiting for something. I dont do the phone-as-gaming-device thing though.",

Strategies to avoid for trivialization  1: Using Zoe at all. A fully-powered boomerang can wipe entire miniboss fights in one turn. 2: Hero archetype 3. One action to get a defense action out of the entire party is ridiculous action economy, and a cheap rune allows it every round. If stacked with archers, the game is trivialized.",

One second you could be doing perfectly, all your party members are full health, and full power. The next, you find an event that does something horrible to you that can screw your entire run up. It can be annoying, it can and will frustrate you, but this game has such a nice charm to it that I keep coming back. It's not the easiest game, it's a Rogue-lite, you WILL die, but all your characters will keep their experience and level (when playing Easy Mode). Some runs will just be to level up newer characters you unlock. I've done quite a few runs like that so far. The art style is fantastic in my opinion. Everything looks nice and fluid and the soundtrack, while not amazing, does a good job of fitting the game. Overall, I definitely recommend this game, but only for people who enjoy Rogue-lites and a bit of a grind to get characters up levels and for the final boss (which can be a pain in butt if you're low levelled).   PS: If the Devs read this, I do have one big complaint, and that's the way you deploy into battle. The deploying is randomized, and more than half the time, my ranged characters would ALWAYS be right next to one or more melee enemies, which means they would be useless. If you guys can fix that, or at least make it less random for the enemy to spawn right on top of you, that'd be nice. Great game overall though, kudas to you guys!",

While the game is simple and practically a flash game on steroids, its well worth the price tag, and if you're willing to put in the time and effort, a great joy to clear, stage by agonizing stage.",

This had the potential to be a great game but it is onesided and often to predictable. the only thing you have going for you is pure chance during strategic map movement, and the only thing you have going for you in Tactical Combat is pure Time in game and high level character and mercs, otherwise you are going to lose. I agree , they could make this much more enjoyable, especially considering the continual re-run of the same monotonous crap in order to get your character and mercs to a high level. It's enjoyable on a play one map and leave the game alone for a while level. Otherwise I wish I could get a refund and wait for a similar game that actually makes adventuring not so dang predictable... Oh look a group of thieves that for some reason still have tons of Invisibilty potions...

He has 50 HP 6 Shields and regens shields every turn, does not take attack of opportunities when he moves or attacks and when you do kill him he respawns with 25 HP and 4 shields which rege every turn as well with no apparent cap. By then the other 6 henchmen, 4 of which heals him every turn really makes this unrealistic. I love a challenge but this goes far beyond that. I wish I had not spent the money. Hereo/mercs cap at level 10, HP from 6-13 max, the cost to upgrade dodge or crit take away too much from damage or health so not balanced at all. ie great crit % but you will get killed in one or two hits. The game has very little strategic value as everything relies on luck not skill. 80% hit chance is more like 20% hit, more often than not your 3-6 attacks will miss.

            "review_text": "Buy this during a sale. It's a short lived rogue-lite turn based RPG. You have a hero and can recruit up to 4 mercenaries (1 after each level you have beaten) that will aid you in your quest to slay the evil king in 8 levels. Each level has its own enemies and terrain as well as places to search and a unique boss. Unfortunately most of the bosses are simply tougher enemies, but lack any distinguishing features. Rinse repeat until you've beaten the game. After every restart of the game a new mercenary will offer you a quest. Completing that quest will unlock the merc permanently. There are 9 in total.  Apart from that you loot locations, upgrade your warriors and buy items to heal, etc. In between fights you have to rest to replenish your forces (but they don't heal automatically). You need to balance the time it takes to rest, loot and just walk on the map from point to point with your overall strength, since enemies will get stronger each day (any moves takes a certain amount of hours to complete). The hardest part is actually keeping your guys healthy after a battle, so you want to get armor for your guys asap, since this regenerates after every fight.  If you play this on 'easy' mode your mercs will keep their earned XP, meaning you get stronger with every playthrough. If you don't I think only the hero keeps his XP, but the hero is definitely not the strongest character in the roster. Play on 'normal' if you want the real experience, but personally I've found the game too boring and repetitive to even bother with that. There are barely any random events in this rogue-lite. You will go through the same levels with the same mercenaries (if you wish), buying the same upgrades and choosing the same level ups all while fighting the same enemies (and amount of enemies) in every playthrough. There are only marginal differences in the half dozen attempts I've done so far and I don't see any room for more, since shops always offer multiple items, inns even offer the same items every time, so there's not much replayability once you've beaten the game (about 4 hours or so for me on easy).  After you get 30 kills on a merc and after you finish the game with them you can choose a 2nd or 3rd starting layout, changing the skills the character brings to the table. This is actually pretty neat, but I would argue that some skills are plainly better than others.  The DLC adds an alternative zone you can also access via the same means every time. This one introduces a new mercenary, which plays pretty uniquely and is actually rather interesting. Apart from that you can complete a new unique quest for each character in this zone (always the first merc you hire, since you can't get your hands on any more until you have to decide whether you want to visit Necropolis), which gives you the option to buy a special item for this character from the inn (available at the start of every level), which makes them far stronger.  I got this for free in a magazine I receive every month, which might tell you a bit about the game, since usually it takes years for games to be included in a magazine, so I'm guessing it doesn't sell all that well. Like I said, it's neat for a couple of hours, but has no longevity or motivation apart from completing the quests for your heroes and unlocking them in the first place. And even that is bare bones. The story is quasi non existant as well. Still, it's not a bad game for the right price.",
