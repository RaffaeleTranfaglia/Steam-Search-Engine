            "review_text": "Bloodrayne is a third-person, action, hack and slash game that originally came out on October 15, 2002. It's been 11 years since i last played it on the original XBOX. Exploring the levels and meeting all the antagonist and monsters again is really nostalgic. Rayne is the main protagonist in the game. She is a dhampir who is in search of her father; Kaegan. She is later recruited into the Brimstone Society and that is where the game begins.   Story: The story in Bloodrayne is not complex at all. You and your mentor Mynce from the Brimstone Society are sent to Mortton, Lousiana to investigate a disease that is turning humans into mutates. The unique enemy in this act are called Maraisreqs. Not much happens in this act apart from your first boss fight the Queen of the Underworld and your first meet with Jurgen Wulf (The main antagonist) who is the founder of the G.G.G and is trying to become immortal by acquiring powerful relics scattered across the world. The next act takes place 5 years later in Argentina, Rayne is assigned to eliminate several high ranking G.G.G.(Gegengeist Gruppe) officers before they can get ahold of one of the powerful relics. These officers serve as the mini-boss and bosses of the game. Midway through the act a new enemy type is introduced called Daemites. Act III takes place in Germany. Rayne is assinged a new list of G.G.G targets to eliminate. This act also introduces another enemy type called Feral Vampires. I can't put the rest of this act in words without spoiling major parts of the story.  Gameplay: The combat system is plain and repetitive but enjoyable; Rayne's primary weapons are her blades which can do up to a 5 meele combo as long as she makes contact with an enemy. Her secondary weapons are guns. There are about 33 different weapons including Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Dynamite and Grenade Launchers) in the game. She has 8 slots for weapons, 3 for light weapons, 3 for heavy weapons, 1 for grenades and 1 for special weapons. Rayne has 3 unique abilities that she can use, one from the start of the game and two you unlock in Argentina. Aura Sense: Targets and destinations will shine bright blue, Dilated Perception: Slow motion, and Extruded View: Allows you to zoom. The game will take you anywhere from 6-8 hours to complete.  Pros: + Basic but enjoyable combat. + Decent amount of variety. + Great level progression. + Immersing experience. + Rayne's dialogue.  Cons: - Checkpoint system can be an annoyance at times. - Graphics are outdated. - The last few words of all dialogue in cutscenes cuts out. (Fixed by turning V-Sync ON = 30 FPS)  Notes: 'Another man falling to pieces over me.' â€• Rayne",

Or I could install additional software to force lock the cursor. But why would I go out of my way when this should be a non-issue for a newly purchased game?",

            "review_text": "Be prepared to spend about an hour trying to get it to work.  When I was able to play it, however, I was really surprised at just how good it looks. Comparable to modern-day MMO graphics, BloodRayne is a brutal hack and slasher that is surprisingly more like a dungeon crawler than you would expect. The gameplay is very repetative, but that doesnt stop it being fun, and I was very impressed with the real-time removal of limbs. The writing and voice acting so far is supurb, really nailing the genre without cheesing it up, and I'm eager to play more.  This game is difficult, however, so you'll need to take certain situations very seriously, namely water. That's right, the only major source of my death so far has been environmental hazards - there are point where you're forced to make your way through flooded areas, which steadily drains your health, and if you're indoors then jumping doesn't help much. This game also features old-school style saving - no quicksaves, only saving at area transitions, which can be quite a chunk of gameplay, especially if you die after a boss. Enemies are generally inconsiquential, unless you're forced to fight an extended number than you can't drain life from, or you encounter a bug that makes them invunerable.  All in all, this is a surprisingly good game. Don't let its age or 'sexiness' fool you, Rayne is a take-control badass that I'd like to see more of in the games industry.",

Featuring large open maps and a (rather annoying) checkpoint save system.   Work for the Brimstone Society; with your shopping list of Nazi officers go off and fill your larders! Using blades, guns, explosives to hunt your prey with vampiric abilities; aura vision, slow motion and fang.  The dialogue is very humourous with Rayne's sarcastic quips, though there is an issue with the last few words often getting cut off.   This is a personal favourite of mine I enjoyed playing years back, I'm glad to be able to experience it all over again. ",

            "review_text": "This is one of many games of the realy 2000's that was just truly astonishing. This game is a classic hack n slash, which brings you to the 1930's, in the shoes of a Dhampir named Rayne, the sexy heroine in the game, who travels from Louisiana, Argentina and Germany, eliminating bizzare vampires and monsters for the Brimstone Society. Under all this, she is searching for her father, which more unfolds about that in the sequel.  This game brings brilliant, fast paced and accurate gameplay with lots of gore, guns and different attacks. Each act (three all up) bring you different strains of monsters with their own back story, each act holds their own little story, everything begins to unfold by end Act II and all Act III.  I have read that a lot of people dislike this game, what ever reason that is, I think that is bogus, because this game just bring so many cool things to the table. One of the many cool things is a boss battle, in giant, armored robots firing rockets and grenades. For me I have to say that this game has aged well, and somewhat has a cult following. The games alone spawned a trilogy of movies (terrible) and comic books. This game has a lot of back story behind it, on the surface there may not be much, but some research later and its got it's own whole universe!  Now to the only bad thing: Windows backwards compatibility is truely amazing, sure it may come with some prices on some titles and this game has one. The game runs at a full 60 fps despite the games' cutscenes were designed to render at 30 frames, so them running at 60 frames, they go too quick and dialogue is cut off, its a famous issue for the game, so what you would need to do is get a program to cap the frame rate. Some people get random crashes and stuff like that, but I never got any. A simple google search and you will find alot of solved threads regarding making Bloodrayne run as good as possible on newer systems.  So, SUMMARY: This game is a true classic, worth the cheap price, a game that has aged well, has fast paced action, a decent story along with a sexy heroine. The game does require some tinkering in order to make it run properly on newer windows machines, but once done you're in for a real nostalgic experience.  Hope my review has helped.  Cheers.",
