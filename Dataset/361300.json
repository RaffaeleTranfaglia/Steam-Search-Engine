    "description": "An old-fashioned beat 'em up with big doses of adrenaline and trippiness, somewhere between the classic style of Streets of Rage and the ultra-violence of Hotline Miami. Set in a cold, ruthless Soviet Union, Mother Russia Bleeds aims to conjure up anxiety, unease, and drug-addled frenzy.",

However, single player or with local, the game proves to be a challenge no matter what. When it comes to either saving up your nekro or using a different drug at the right time, to fighting differently depending on the type of enemy, this is what makes the gameplay solid.   To top it off as well, the soundtrack is good and reminds me dearly of Hotline Miami's intense music. With the occasional crashes however and a few bugs here and there, I would still recommend this at full price. Hell, I've spent more for worse before.",

            "review_text": "A game that hearkens back to the early 90's arcade style of beat'em'ups, but with allot of extra attitude, engaging storyline, and a difficulty curve that will challenge even the most seasoned bet'em'up veterans. Huge waves of enemies that make you strategize your movement, and your assault.  This game has a very mature dialogue, and visual style. So be warned about that, or embrace it. I had a grand time with that!  However, my criticism has to take on a few glaring flaws. No health meters for the enemies, and no portraits/names. This would have made for a much more engaging game, where Streets of Rage and Final Fight shined. Also, the dialogue sometimes tends to babble. Yes, I like the story, but it could use a bit of a trim as it can continue for longer than you anticipate, and if you die on ascene with dialogue, yes you can skip it, but sometimes skipping it can lead you to missing vital ques, because the action starts as soon as the dialogue is over. I just thik a few of these annoyances could make this game so much better.  This game has the potential to drive a series. But if there is a sequal, I would really want to see these things I listed above. Otherwise, I am afraid I probably would not buy it for full price.  But overall, this is a quality game, with an excellent visual and music style. My viewers and I were reveling at how awesome it was. Edgy, gritty, no BS.",

Others have complained about the game's difficulty. If you are experienced at beat em ups and/or fighting games like Street Fighter, you will probably not find this game very difficult.   Now the bad:   There are four characters, but there may as well be one. They all have the same story and essentially the same moves. Devs could have made this a deeper game by giving characters different combos/juggles, different stories/personalities, etc. The dialogue is lengthy, poorly written and seems like an afterthought.   Overall the game is worth the price I paid for it ($8), and is good for at least one play-through. However, it could have been an awesome game if the fighting system was deeper, more attention was paid to the dialogue, and characters varied meaningfully in terms of gameplay and story. The game feels incomplete and could have used some more time in development.",

However, I would qualify this as a somewhat expert-level beat-em-up, this is not really an entry-level game. If you're not sure if you like 2D beat-em-ups (and that's fair because there have barely been any good ones since the start of the 128bit+ gaming era started), you should play/emulate Streets of Rage 1, 2, and 3 for Sega Genesis. If like those games but want a more complex fighting system with deeper game mechanics, then Mother Russia Bleeds is the game for you.  10/10 would punch again.",

            "review_text": " I was pretty excited for  Mother Russia Bleeds , but in the end, it turned out to be just another run-of-the-mill beat'em up.  For being an indie title, I expected more heart, honestly. I also expected a bit more attention to detail. For example, at least in the first three levels, almost none of the environment and backgrounds were interactable. It was a clean-cut hallway the whole way. There are not near enough animations either. For example, when you shoot an enemy you will literally decapitate him everytime (which is kind of stupid in its own right).   The trailer showcases so many awesome moves and action sequences that are very infrequent in the game.  The game I played was much slower and more grindy than the trailer, for sure.  The design decisions with the music are also quite questionable. It isn't super great, and more importantly, it doesn't really fit in some levels (for example, the Squatter level). It needs to be higher energy.  The controls are a high point. I do like the injection mechanism and how you have a choice to get additional health OR a buff.    Pros:  +Cool control scheme and health/buff management +Leadboard addition is great +Good idea overall   Cons:  -Very little is interactable -The dialogue is cringe-worthy, and this is where they could have added some great humor -Animations become redundant oh-so-very quickly -Music is not high enough energy   I think the price is too high given that this title doesn't do near enough new. Yeah, its edgy, but so what? At the end of the day you are still left with a fairly grindy beat'em up. ",

I'm a simple guy. I don't want to master guard cancels and air juggles to perfect a 400 hit combo. I just want to play as a muscular dude in suspenders and slam other dudes' heads into the cement really hard.  There have been games that do try to keep it mostly simple and old school, like Scott Pilgrim and Double Dragon Neon, but the gameplay just always seems a bit off. I've also played some really BAD ones like The Warriors: Street Brawl (definitely NOT to be confused with Rockstar's amazing game), and that game REALLY got it wrong. Grab attacks were severely underpowered and all enemies' attacks had priority over yours, which meant you would be huddled in a corner holding the block button hoping for an open opportunity to throw a punch. It's like these developers just watch a YouTube video of the classics without having actually played them.  This game finally gets it right. It's glorious, and I'm so grateful. The weapons feel right, the basic attacks feel good, grabbing and slamming guys with the big muscular dude is everything I could ask for. It puts a cool little spin on the health system to set it apart that I approve of. It even lets you play with bots. I give it 5 Mad Gears out of 5.",

Loads of biching about difficulty here. If you are sensible gamer its not dificult at all. It works like any other game - you learn you get familliar with attack paterns and you just become better every time. Game sort you out give you weapions, heals, you can heal your friend too.  Graphics is brillian wery detailer (pixel art) animated bacgrounds. Enemies are unique every stage. New and new enemies are coming as you progress.  Music is great, fit nicely.  There are some dialogs in agame, some takes ages. But you can skip them. Characters, are not that different from each orther in terms of super abilieties or whatever, but I dont see that as an issue.  Didnt encounter any gliches or bugs.

There are a couple technical nitpicks- when a game is as difficult as this, things like hitboxes are really important, and when you're trying to slide-kick beneath a jump-kicking enemy and somehow get hit it can be really frustrating- but I had an absolute blast with Mother Russia Bleeds. It's not particularly punishing despite its brutal difficulty- checkpoints are pretty frequent and if you die you get a full syringe of health- and Devil-Trigger-Style-Badass-Mode-inducing Ecto Cooler and a full health bar to help you along. Toughest part was getting the alternate ending- though the last boss was fun enough that I didn't really mind that!  Oh, and the soundtrack is fantastic. My one major issue with the game is the lack of online co-op- if that gets patched in later I would be really grateful!",

            "review_text": "Mother Russia Bleeds is definatly a throw back to all those oldschool beat 'em ups we loved playing with our friends back when we were young and stupid. However, this game try's to be more oldschool in terms of it's designs and apperance, while not really having any special attack moves or even combos, or blocking for that matter. It it still a fun game, but I'd say it should be bought on a sale, since it's rather short and the missing multiplayer co-op kinda cheapens it in a way.",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying that anyone who is complaining about this game difficulty has NEVER EVER played beat em up games on the old consoles where you only had a few lives and few or no continues, not to mention the arcades where you played at the highest difficulty setting with just 1 or 2 lives. Mother Russia Bleeds gives you infinite lives and checkpoints, so if you die you automatically restart at a checkpoint. It's true that the game may proove itself difficult in some stages, but it also gives you a way to manage your health and damage thanks to the Nekro drug, so if you can combine the Nekro management with the dodge ability and the various attacks then you can survive even the most furious horde of enemies. Technically speaking, the game graphics and presentation are sick and there is literally tons of physical and psycological violence to be seen. The music is awesome and while the sound effects are ok, I would have loved some voice acting. As wrote before, the gameplay is very good and all the levels have enemies who behave differently and an end level boss which you have to beat following some minor strategy.   Now the cons: every character plays the same, it's just a matter of appearence, there are no different special moves to be pulled off or different strategies to be used according to the selected character. The other thing I didn't really like is the final boss, the idea is cool but the fight is a bit boring to go through.   That said, I would recommend this game to every old school beat'em up fan and to people who loved Hotline Miami, Cronenberg movies and of course are not offended by some violence.   Cheers!",

The combos are fun to pull off and feel rewarding when you come up with your own, and the weapons feel very satisfying to use.",

            "review_text": "Mother Russia Bleeds is a great game that offers you a great soundtrack, challenging bosses, and fun, somewhat satisfying gameplay.  Pros:  -Soundtrack: The soundtrack is fast paced and is quite memorable at times.  -fighting: Although not the best, (due to enemy hitboxes being pretty small) it does feel quite satisfying to grab someone mid air and slamming them in the ground, or punching someone with a charged punch. Fixing the hitboxes on enemies would make the fighting fantastic.  Cons:  -Characters: The characters could use a splash of personality. You have 4 main characters to choose from and all of them have the same dialogue during converstions. Giving the characters unique dialogue could make them more memorable and likeable but as it stands, they're all pretty bland.  -Story: The story is nothing to write about (ha ha) but the one thing il'll say is that it focuses too much on the whole 'this country is falling apart' story rather than the story about how you ended up in a lab and what exactly this 'necro' drug is.  Overall, it's a pretty good game. 7/10",

The 4 protagonists are wonderful and the enemies are numerous.  The setting is nostalgic and recreated so that it shapes the idea that this is really dirty.  I wish i bought the Dealer edition of the soundtrack but hopefully can get it on a music site.  It may be the best bloody break from other games, it was a risk that I took and was rewarded for it.

Pros: + Quite a long adventure actually, about 9 hours (only counting story mode) + Variation in level layout and game mechanics, in one segment u will fight for survival in a game of fisticuffs and in the next u´ll chuck guys in a meat grinder, all in one level. + the atmosphere is heavy thanks to the soundtrack. + Graphics, this is a pretty good looking game   Cons: - music gets a bit boring though. - checkpoints are scarce but this also enchances the experince... depends on what u like. - the grapphic chioices are also quite bland in some areas. ´sometimes it gets hard to focus on what character you are. The characters all look the same sometimes.",

            "review_text": "This game, like a lot of beat-'em-ups, is very fast paced and can get very gruelling. What sets Mother Russia Bleeds apart, however, is much more than I expected when first going into this game. The first few minutes of the story immediately grabbed my attention and what followed up held my attention. The art style, the attention to detail, the variety of enemies, the brutal gore, all of it was masterfully created. The controls are smooth and seem to just blend with everything so well that the game can't be blamed for your 20+ deaths, (which will happen, I can almost guarantee,) and it feels satisfying to land a held punch attack or perform an awesome combo.  Something else, too that shocked me was the storyline. This game is surprisingly well fleshed out and deep for being the standard style of 2D fighting games. The story makes you feel for these characters and when they say or do something badass, you can't help but to get hyped up for what's coming next. Ivan, the biggest and strongest is my personal favorite to play as but there are three more characters that shift up the gameplay to some level, from being a big, hulking tank to being a fast, fragile fighter, to being a well-balanced and easy-to-comprehend murdering machine. The enemies are formidible opponents, though, so don't be shocked when you easily feel overwhelmed even with bots and a friend on your side.  All in all, it's a very fun game to play to kill a little, (or a whole lot,) of time with a buddy or just going solo for a challenge. (P.S., the power-ups are cool, too.)",
