What will you choose, The grapichs are simplistics but still nice looking. You can be an adult, kid or old person. This is in first person view and and you feel the difference when controlling the different characters. There are multiple endings and alot of things too look at. The hole game is not unlocked since this is free so it is more like a demo of it. If a game that makes you think is for you then Enjoy keep going and have fun :)",

Even though these are small life lessons this game puts a person in to the dilemma of having to deal with some situations that some people/families have had to deal with in the past.This game also teaches a person about oneself and can even make a person think about oneself for example if a person is internally making the right choices in life or ones that may only be hurting their life.   Verdict: I liked the game even if it was a short one I really loved the design and message that it can and should give to a person. I would definitly reccomend to atleast try it it is about a 10 minute download (probably shorter) and worth the 30 minutes to an hour gameplay.",

Right off the bat, one of the first things you will notice, is that the english in this game is pretty bad. While this is easily over-looked, it is still very annoying when setting the room. Now to describe the game itself!  This game uses a hub setting where all the levels are set in different rooms, each of which gives you several different scenarios. After entering the room you can choose whether to experience it as a child, adult, or senior citizen. This dynamic in itself is very focused on plot, but is used in a game which... has no plot? A questionable choice, but not a deal breaker. The real deal breaker is what happens after: Nothing! Let me explain. After choosing the scenario you will be teleported to the area you chose, as the character you chose. From there you can walk around and experience the situation. Often times it is pretty bland and lacking, and the couple of sentences used to describe it into a sensible situation are poorly written.   At this point it probably seems like a game with a poor setting, and their are tons of enjoyable games like that, but that isn't the bad part. The main thing that ruins this game is that it's pointless. After entering the scenario you walk, or fly, or whatever it asks. It feels very boring and unrewarding, and after doing it for about 2 or 3 minutes you hit a dead end. And that's it. There is nothing beyond that. All you can do is return to the hub from the main menu, and try a different scenario.  The gameplay consists entirely of walking, but unlike slender-man and other great walking games, there is no point to this one. The entire game is designed around a poorly written, meaningless story, that can't really even be called a story.  On top of everything it is extremely buggy as well, just FYI  So you have a game that: -Doesn't play well -Is glitchy -Poorly designed -Confuses the player with lack of instruction -Is POINTLESS and MEANINGLESS  Now I'm not trying to hate on the game itself or its creator, I'm just stating facts. Assuming this was made by a single developer, or maybe a small group of rookies, it's actually a pretty good attempt. However, you can't just turn anything into a game. You need to put some forethought into it. Checking you writing is also very important, and this game clearly didn't go through any of the essential checkpoints of game design. Avoid if at all possible.   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE BUY THE PAID VERSION!!! I can only imagine how disappointed I would be if I had paid for this.",

Cons: - Your character usually move slow, through long paths with nothing happening. - For each character/story, you have at least 2 minutes holding down the 'W' key looking at the same ambient until you reach the destination. - Feels unpolished. Mouse leaving the game window. Footsteps being heard while flying. Ugly (low-res) font+shadow rendering. Dumb AI at the office. - Too much filler. Long stretches of nothing (just walking) or repetition (shoot the enemy too many times without any indication of progress; then it finally dies). Things seem to be there only to make the interaction longer, but not deeper.  This is an artsy game. It is meant to be looked at, it is meant to be thought-provoking.  However, I felt bored. I would have looked more at it, but there was nothing to look at. It made me think: 'Why am I wasting time doing this? This feels as boring as Dear Esther.'.  I'm sure there is some story the game is trying to tell, but there is too much time-wasting filler to between the small pieces of it.",
