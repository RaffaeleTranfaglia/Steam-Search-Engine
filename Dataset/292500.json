            "review_text": "A pretty excellent shooter with a great soundtrack. Everything in the weapons, levels, and enemies feels meticulously tuned to perfection. I love all the odd little gameplay homages to games from my childhood: Mickey's Mousecapade, Megaman, Adventure Island, Mario World, TMNT, etc.  It's not as big a story as Cave Story, but the goofy office characters are much easier to relate to. The Hard mode is actually a new story with new levels and bosses, so you haven't really completed it until you've done that.",

            "review_text": "UPDATED:   I got nothing interesting to say about the game but here goes nothing. This is one of those well made games that don't revolutionize anything but just works. It's an action platformer, with lots of variety of environments and enemies. It has a finite number of lives system, that sends you back to the beginning of the level when you run out of it and to the beginning of the screen when you lose one life.   The game self regulates the difficulty with its upgrade system. Each time you die you keep all your money, so eventually you'll beat whatever part you're stuck by simply having more fire power. Bosses don't have to be beaten ever again! which is nice considering they are not only difficult but quite long. In my previous review I didn't notice that and almost gave up on the game because I didn't want to fight a specific boss again.  I liked it. If you want some platforming action fun, this game is for everyone basically. I can't think of any demographic that wouldn't get a kick out of it.",

Why am I downloading Joy2Key so I can use a 360 controller properly? This is ridiculous- and if this game was made by any other studio I'd thumbs-down it on principle.

            "review_text": "While wrapped in an aesthetically pleasing package this was a huge disappointment to play. The game play feels a lot like sleepwalking through a crudely reconstructed memory of what a platform game is supposed to be, offering zero challenge or need for thought beyond the occasional realization that a particular stage element is interactive enough to shoot, all of which quickly fade into the background after the initial encounter.  I am not particularity skilled at platform games, and most of my success on that front stems from sheer perseverance in the face of challenge. I only beat Cave Story's true game once and have yet to replicate that act in CS+ no longer having the patience or the reaction time I once did, though I have certainly tried. I have not beaten Kero Blaster and I really couldn't bring myself to continue playing, having gotten to the end of the 'surface game' and never once feeling like I was having fun. I have read that the game opens up a little more, becomes more difficult, that the stages are more cleverly designed in the second pass but it failed to make me want to get to that point and there is no reason that anyone should be expected to play through half of a boring game just to enjoy the latter part.  The entirety of the game up to the point that I stopped was little more than holding down the fire button through an entire stage while running in one direction; every so often having to press up before holding down the fire button, jumping over the rare projectile while holding down the fire button, running slightly backwards while holding down the fire button or switching to a different weapon before holding down the fire button to clear out an entire screen. There were intermittent jumps onto slow moving platforms or across short gaps, none of which required any thought. Neither the enemies nor the bosses provided any challenge whatsoever since all I had to do was hold down the fire button and not charge directly into them while they are still alive. The ones I encountered before throwing in the towel also felt like hollowed out shells of enemies that I had fought before in a more interesting game, having their mechanics stripped down to a bare minimum and all of their charm abandoned at the writing desk.  The characters themselves were kind of cute in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way, though the story wasn't interesting enough to give them much more substance than mild comic relief. Granted, I didn't play it all the way through so I didn't get the full experience but the opinions that I read about it being clever and involved seemed like they were written by people playing an entirely different game. The music was rather generic as well, having an unobtrusive and lighthearted tone that while fitting for the experience left no lasting impression whatsoever.  I'm almost inclined to suggest this game for a very young audience as it asks so little from the player in regard to both skill and attention but it might be unfair to set such a low ceiling for them. Overall it feels like the creator phoned this one in and left it to the players to convince themselves it was worth their time. Perhaps one day I will return to this game as I really wanted to enjoy it, but try as I might I could not bring myself to.",

            "review_text": "This is a fun, sweet, cute little shooter! I recommend checking out Pink Hour, also by the same dev, to see if you'll like the gameplay. It's very much the same, albeit it has more to it like 4 weapons, with multiple upgrades each. Sometimes in Cave Story, by the same developer, you kinda felt like you should have jumped when you didn't. I didn't have that problem at all with this title. The only thing I wanted that it didn't have was the ability to shoot directly down, but the levels don't ever make it so you actually need to be able to do this. Heavily recommended if you like a bit of fun run and gun that doesn't last too long but leaves you feeling satisfied.",

You may die, but it won't be due to anything cheap, you'll always be aware that it was your fault and know how to get past the part. The graphics have an 8 bit charm, and the music is memorable. This is a short game, maybe 2 hours, but once you beat it you can play new game +, which is harder.  I recommend this game if you like shooters, or Cave Story",

I think that the two Previously released teaser games Pink Hour and Pink Heaven seemed to have some sort of quality that made it seem more fun and new... this may have just been the compleatly adorable female protagonist used as the main character, but that seems to irrelivant to gameplay to make that assumption. All in all i was turned off after just a few mins. becuse it just wasnted what i wanted i gess wich was a Pink Hour video game... ahh well. BUTTT just because i liked the Pink titles so much i have to recomend thesse titles just be warey they are differnt in slightly less satisfing ways. Great Animation .... Decent controls and gameplay.... not necessarily worth 10$ in my opinion tho.",

            "review_text": "once again daisuke 'pixel' amaya (creator of cave story and ikachan) shows off his many amazing talents. kero blaster is a rather straightforward and somewhat short run 'n gun game, with a linear path, themed stages, and boss battles. while all of these traits are common, kero blaster is made unique by its smart level design, clever enemies, fun weapon upgrades, and most of all, pixel's distinctive difficult-to-describe charm and humor.  though its visual style can be considered 'retro', it never feels as if it's leaning or depending on Retro Nostalgia to get by. in fact, much like pixel's previous games, it never even feels like it's trying to emulate any specific era or console at all. pixel's artwork is simplistic but cute, much like his music, which is catchy, memorable, and well-composed as usual. my one complaint about how the game controls is jumping, which is not only a bit floaty and takes some getting used to, but sometimes requires impeccable timing. luckily this issue isn't encountered often in the main game, but it really starts to show in 'zangyou mode' (the game's hard mode), where much of the added difficulty unfortunately relies on tricky platforming and precise jumps. aside from that, kero blaster is just plain  fun , on top of being generally light-hearted and adorable thanks to its characters, writing, music, and various locales.  in my opinion, comparisons to cave story (though unavoidable) aren't entirely fair. yes, it lacks the detail and depth and length of cave story, and certainly hasn't reached the level of attention or praise that cave story has received over the years, but hopefully over time more people will come to appreciate kero blaster on its own as yet another classic, individual, and meticulous labor of love from one of the most talented game developers working today.",

Kero Blaster is an action platformer with an arcadey feel to it. You die in a few hits, and health is a bit scarce, making the game fairly challenging. Coins collected during the campaign can be used to upgrade guns into more powerful and satisfying ones, as well as increase your max health.  While the game only took me about two hours to complete, the excellent enemy design and pacing (as well as a hard mode unlocked after finishing the game) provide high replay value.  The soundtrack is also fantastic.",
