            "review_text": "Quick a dirty breakdown: Pros- Followed suite with many of the characteristics of the original game. Very nostalgic. Smooth gameplay, very little fps stutter. Great gameplay mechanics as well as gunplay. Very immerise and is more than capable of getting your adrenaline going. Open world (while limited) leaves the player to make their own choices.  Cons- Periodical crashes, could be simply on my end. Rather unoptimized, can be difficult to run for lower end computers. Not many graphic options. Rather few choices considering gunplay. You either roll with an OP snper rifle or enjoy challening yourself.  Conclusion: I love this game. Absolutely reccomend to anybody who enjoyed previous installments in the series. I would love to see the addition of more dinosaurs (There's only 6 you can hunt in regards to a trophy. Kind of dissapoitning) and more weapons. Would absolutely spend more money to aquire that. It's sad that it was rather difficult to find a gem like this, as it deserves much more attention than it's given!",

            "review_text": "I've bought just about every dinosaur game ever released, and none have ever quite acheived the holy grail of immersion splendour and terror that theJurrasic Park/ time travelling concept promises. However I've always retained a soft spot for the original Carnivores; prehistoric reptile-hunting pared down to the bare minimum, and without the tedious weight of plot, or survival aspects to get in the way. I was disappointed over the years to find that Carnivores would no longer run on newer versions of Windows, so when I saw this my heart leapt a beat. I have to say I'm just an hour or so in, but I'm liking it for all the same reasons as before.  The graphics have improved over the first outing (given its been nearly 15 years) but the feel is the same whacky future hunting scenario as before. As everyone else has commented it could defintely do with a few more species (hopefully some potential DLC?). The game size is tiny (less than a Gig) and I'd love to see this game format used in a big full budget environment like Cry engines latest 'Dino Island revisited' tech demo.  Conclusion- Pleasingly pared down gameplay and solid immersion, the graphics are good but far from spectacular. Devs - More dinos and a hi-res texture map set please.  9/10 (1 point for nostalgia's sake!)",

Pachycephalosaurus charging as soon as they see you... maybe some compsognatus that try to bite your arm (like the snakes of far cry 3/4) and making noises revealing your position to the closest dinosaurs. If they could interact with each others it could be really cool to watch some raptors jump from the bushes, take down a large herbivore and steal your kill right in front of you...",

            "review_text": "This game is what I hoped TheHunter:Primal would be. Where TheHunter had you collecting stuff before you could really hunt anything, in this game, they drop you off on an island ready to go. There is a money system, 'gems', that you use to buy upgrades in the game. It does get a bit grindy when you are mostly just killing things to get enough gems to progress, but this is to be expected. Who wants to have all the best stuff right out of the gate? So you start off hunting with no 'toys' and a standard gun. At some point you'll be able to buy a crossbow, which is better at taking down wampuses but has a lot of drop after you fire it. So you have to look at your distance to figure out where to shoot. Not too much after that I was able to buy the sniper rifle, which is pretty much where you aim you hit.  There are only a handful of dinosaurs, but the ones they picked are very well done. The one people might miss would be a Velociraptor, although there is a medium sized carnivore that chases you around to make up for that.  The environments are really well done. There are some islands in fog where you can't see where the dinos are very well, and this really adds to the tension. The final island is a big, rocky place where you can see the dinosaurs from far away and is maybe a bit too easy, but at this point you'll mostly be cleaning up the achievements you haven't got, so I thought that was OK. Oh, and there's also 'mutant' dinosaurs, which are rare and give you another thing to go after. They are supposed to be extra dangerous I guess, but I never noticed much difference.  I think I got this in a bundle. I would say it's worth the $15 regular price though. As you can see, I've got over 13 hours on it to get all the achievements and pretty much do everything in the game once.  There may not be a whole lot to it, but if you're after a dinosaur hunting game, this does that really well and is fun, and that's what matters! I'll probably play it again sometime down the road.",

            "review_text": "I used to like Carnivores. Not to love 'em or something but still like it. Now on Steam Sales there was this and I couldn't resist. After playing for like 2 hours, I can give my thoughts about the game.   The game offers us a trip to a planet inhabited by dinosaurs provided by a fictional hunting firm DinoHunt. Our job is simple. We get one of the available weapons (those are pretty limited to 3 kinds), get additional equipment like a camouflage and we are thrown into a prehistoric landscape. We have to stalk through jungle to hunt like 7 or 8 kinds of dinosaurs, including ferocious T-rex. Every kill is awarded with gems and score (depends on how many shots we took to take down the beast, what was the distance and stuff), which is a somewhat a currency in the game for opening new levels. With gems we pay for our equipment, weapons and license for a particular species of a dinosaur. We can hunt freely for every type we encounter, but only licensed dinosaurs will be in our thropy room. And that's pretty much it. We get the score quite fast so sooner or later we get access to new levels until we get it all and then the game loses it's replay value. That's pretty much all in terms of gameplay.  The graphics are nice but compared to other games it looks really decent. The dinosaurs are quite well detailed but I've seen better. Also beware to not turn on the advanced grass. It will slow ur PC to a calculator mode from the stone age era.   Next thing is the sound. We get a simple, forgetable music in the background and the enviroment sounds which are mostly re-used stock sounds like crickets, wind sound and typical jungle uproars. In case of dinosaurs, we get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stock sounds, took from cartoons I guess. Really, in old carnivores games, there were better sounds than in this one.  Overall I would give the game 6/10. It's an good game for a dinosaur maniacs, but people who are not used to stalk'n kill games and are not into dinosaurs at all, should look for another game. I would highly recommend for the devs to add more dinosaur species (really? Only 2 carnivores? No Velociraptor? No Allosaurus? Shame...) and a larger variety of weapons. That way this game would have at least some replay value. At this point, it's just a decent dino-shooter.",

The graphics are gorgeous and the AI is good, and the variety in individual dinosaurs even from the same species in terms of size, mutated colors, and behavior is very refreshing. The environments are gorgeous and the weather very immersive. Even with only five dinosaurs currently licensed the replayability is practically endless. It's a great value for the money and the devs have left further improvement and features open for addition and improvement. I highly recommend it, as both an avid player and longtime fan of the Carnivores series!",

The graphics are amazing and very much improved with a spectacular environment having lots of trees rocks etc. giving you many areas to hide! The gameplay is very similar to the original, being dropped on an island hunting dinosaurs.  You start by only able to hunt one species, and gain gems depending on the size and accuracy of the dinosaurs. These gems are then used to unlock new locations, new deadlier dinosaurs, and upgrade your gear weapons and person attributes. The amount of gems you need to unlock the new dinosaurs is kind of ridiculous but that's what keeps you playing.  There are a few things different compared to the original series. First of all the dinosaurs you hunt are 50 times bigger! Way more threatening and more crucial to hide. Sadly there aren't as many dinosaurs to hunt including the Velociraptors. Which were super tiny, fast and hard to hunt without being seen/killed first. The death scene isn't to interesting, in the originalyou saw your dead body while the dinosaur ate you or the T-Rex flinging you around. While this game just has the dinosaur opening his jaws in slow motion and ending the game.   Very enjoyable, and it's a great game just like it's predecessors!  10/10",

I also would have liked the environment to be a more authentic mesozoic ecosystem, though its better than almost any other dinosaur game so its hardly worth mentioning. I also would like to have seen some interactions between the Dinosaurs. thus far I have not seen a predator hunting anything but me, and it would be neat to see the animals behave in more social ways.

Beautiful graphics, neat new features, but the core experience of the original games. For those who haven't played it, it is a hunting game where you are put on a large island (there are several islands in the game) and you must track down dinosaurs and kill them. Each dinosaur has their own weak points on their bodies, and some like the Ankylosaurus and Triceratops have armoured body parts that make it more difficult. Each dinosaur has a unique sense of sight, hearing, and smell, and different behaviour patterns. For instance, the Stegosaurus is docile and will only run away when it detects you. The Ceratosaurus is a carnivore and will try to eat you, but if you wound it badly, it will retreat. I haven't encountered the T-Rex yet in this new game, but they are probably going to be much more aggressive.  The only negative thing I can point out about the game is that it is missing Velociraptors. They were a very unique dinosaur in the old games and I would have loved to see them return in the new one, especially since they are such a popularly known dinosaur.",

And watch out- those creatosaurs sneak up on you!  Suggestiong to Devs: New dinosaurs (more realistic, like 3ft feathered raptors or archeopteryx and some mosasaurs n such-esentially the pteranodons are a nice touch- and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to take down!) would be awesome.

            "review_text": "While the graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay is pretty simple, is the game really worth the $15? Well... No; but why not?  First and foremost, it's important to say that I grew up playing the original Carnivores games. I was five when I got the first one, and I've been playing them for almost two decades. That should tell you of the love and dedication I feel towards this series. It should also tell you of the excitement I felt when I learned of this remake; I bought it immediately, without even considering the pros or cons. All I knew, and all I cared about, was that it was Carnivores. I ended up regretting that blind loyalty.  Let's talk about some pros, first. As I mentioned earlier, the graphics are gorgeous. They're a vast improvement over the original games and while the experience in the originals isn't by any means unpleasant, you can never escape the feeling of playing a game. The graphics are pixely at best and a mess at worst. In this remake, however, the graphics have been stunningly updated and the experience can quickly turn into one where you feel a part of the game and get lost in the scenery.  The gameplay, while not necessarily better, is definitely not hard to get a handle on. It took me a few minutes to get it, but when I did, the game became much easier; they also don't thrust new mechanics on you halfway through a hunt. Once you've got everything, you've got it, and you can go on your merry way.  Now... on to the cons.  While the originals didn't have a crazy variety of dinosaurs to choose from, they certainly had more than this game. Yes, the dinosaurs are probably harder and take longer to produce, but there could have been patches or expansions that added more animals, and there haven't been. It gets boring hunting the same animals over and over, and unlike the originals, you can't mix and match what you hunt and where. There's a set list on each map, and once you've done it all, there's nothing left to do.  There are very few maps, as well. The originals had many more options, and they were all fun to explore, as each one had secrets and easter eggs to find. Reborn, while the graphics are beautiful, has very little variety in the way of locations. There are three overall, with separate options for Dawn and Fog, giving you the feeling of more while actually giving you less. Despite the wonderful graphics, they do not make up for the lack of options in this game.  If you're here for nostalgia, which there's a good chance you are, you will not find it here. This game is nothing like the originals. The dinosaurs are overall better, with significant improvements to their looks and AI, but the maps are nothing like the maps they were named after (for example, in the original Carnivores, Basmachee Rocks was not a desert). The gameplay, while easy to master much like the original, is nothing like the original gameplay and is not necessarily smooth.  Overall, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn does not feel like a remake or even an ode to the original Carnivores series. It comes across as a half-baked product that was shoved out at the peak of the Jurassic World hype and was then abandoned shortly after. In the year+ it's been out, it's received two patches (and only within the first few months of its release), no updates, and no expansions or added content. If you want to spend $15 on Carnivores, buy the mobile version, as it's identical to Carnivores 2, has more dinosaur options, more weapon options, and more map options; and it's only $7.",
