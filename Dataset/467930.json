Yes, please! Quite worth it! Simplistic on its premise, yet fun and refreshing in execution.   Play this game. If you like battling against hordes of enemies, I assure you that you won't be disappointed.",

Ramps up difficulty nicely, Limited number of enemies but they become more aggressive and patterns of attack become more complex. And I like fanservice-y chacters. So sue me.  I hope to see another game by this guy.  PS Please, please, put in Steam cloud. I have a PC and a Razer laptop and would like to cross-play.",

For a one man game dev its extremely well made considering most indie devs with large teams pull a real bs move and take off with what they make and leave a half finished buggy mess. A tad bit grindy but what you can get for the effort is well worth it.",

It's just mindless enough to play while paying attention to something else, while the controls and mechanics are very tight and well thought out making for a fun little brawler.",

I really wanted to like this game and if the camera issues were fixed (some sort of auto-angle function, further zoom out available, and inverted Y-axis) I'd LOVE it, but as is it's more frustrating than fun.  Really I felt like I was fighting the camera way more than any enemy.",
