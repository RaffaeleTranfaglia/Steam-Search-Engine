            "review_text": "The Meet Your Match update was toted by Valve to be a complete overhaul of the existing UI and the format by which casual and competitve players select what type of game mode they specifically want. What ultimately happened is:  - You can no longer pick what public server you want - You're forced to sit in a queue for at least 5 minutes, oftentimes longer if you don't rage quit by the 20 minute mark - 'Casual' servers have experience but you get penalized if you leave a server early - Since the update came out, the 'item servers' and 'game coordinator' are barely functional - If you wanted to play competitive, you better pay the premium!  Valve has tried too hard to consolidate everything. They took away Quickplay, the server browser, and the ability to jump in/out of a game ... because God forbid you have any other commitments in your life. If you can't sit through a whole 30 minute Payload game without the ability to change teams, you better be ready to get dinged for it.   In summary, the post-MYM Team Fortress 2 is oftentimes literally unplayable –– whether you be waiting in purgatory to join a game, or waiting for the 'can't connect with game coordinator' error message to go away. And when its not literally unplayable, it's pretty much unplayable.    P.S. TEAM HEAVY   EDIT: After I wrote this review, I waited 30 minutes in queue without ever joining a game.",

Remember the good old times where you didn't have to wait 40 minutes in a queue to play a game that lasts about 2 minutes?  Well, Valve says: No more!   In all serious however - this last update is the finishing stroke for TF2. I still cannot believe what they did to this game i played for about two years by now, which i loved and cherished, before it basically pushed the middlefinger into their players faces. This game used to be fun, now it just feels awfully competitive, like a competition really, even in a gamemode called 'Casual' There is nothing casual about any of this anymore.  As I'm writing this, i sit in a queue to play on a map i didn't even choose with people i didn't even choose, get sorted into a team i didn't even choose. The longest time i have been waiting to get into a game was over an hour. And once i WAS sorted in, i played one round which was about 2 minutes long.  I get experience points, i get disconnected, i wait again. Forty minutes until i am in the next game, same scenario.   Honestly, i am thinking about deinstalling TF2 after this. Because i seriously loose all my patience, interest and support for this game  ",

I have pumped so, so many hours into this game and as of late, I've been turned off from TF2 and I really am worried with the way things are right now and seem to be headed. I was honestly looking forward to this update when I first heard about it, and when it came out I immedietely tried out the new casual mode and when I finally got into a server after waiting about 30 minutes (because quickplay got removed) I was greeted with a 6v12 round and got my ♥♥♥ handed to me and had to disconnect after finishing. Since then casual mode has improved, yes, but it could have simply been an added on instead of replacing pubs because in all honesty as I see it, casual is simply competitive easy mode where as pubs were all about having fun with very little consequences where it didn't really matter if you won or lost. I really don't understand why Valve decided to get rid of pubs. Who knows, maybe it was an idea made by the developers that decided that Phlog pyros should become godly before renerfing it to what it is now.",

            "review_text": "Let's start.  Team Fortress 2 it's a FPS (First Person Shooter) game made by Valve and published in 2007, after the beta. The game has nine classes:  ATTACK CLASSES:  °Scout  °Soldier  °Pyro  DEFENSE CLASSES:  °Demoman  °Heavy  °Engineer  SUPPORT CLASSES.  °Medic  °Sniper  °Spy  Each class has his advantages and disadvantages. For example a Spy can kill easily a Heavy, but at the same time he can be get killed by a Pyro. Or a Scout can kill without problem a Sniper or an Engineer, but at the same time he can be killed by Demomen or Soldiers.  This system of advantages and disadvantages makes the game very funny.  The game has also a drop system, which allows to find randomly new weapons and, if lucky, new hats. Infact the game has a lot of weapons, which can be unlocked with achievements (Example: The Force-A-Nature) or can be picked randomly during a game. Each weapons has his own advantages and disadvantages, making the game balanced. For example the Phlogistinator, a Pyro weapon, can gain easily crits but it can't use the compressor (which is essential for airblasting projectiles).   The game has also a lot of hats, which makes Team Fortress 2 a original FPS. The player can use the hats for customizing his own character. Hats can be purchased by the Mann. Co Store or being traded for refined metal (Which is the 'money' of the game).   The game has also a trading system, which allows players to trade weapons and hats, keeping the 'TF2 economy' alive.  Now let's see what it is inside the game!  Team Fortress 2 has a lot of gamemodes, for example Attack/Defense or Capture the Flag.  In Attack/Defense the BLU must cap every RED's point. The BLU will win if they will cap every point before the time expires, otherwise the RED will win.  The TF2 community is always active, expecially on trading, but I don't refuse to say that in the community there are some disrispectful and discriminating people, often following the ideology 'You have no hats? You're a noob!'. Beside this the community is quite friendly.  Now my personal opinion:  I play this game since 23 May 2014 and it never tired me. I enjoy playing this game because it's wonderful how you can meet new friends and working with them for win the match. Every character has his own stereotype, and this make me laugh (in positive sense, of course).   I think Team Fortress 2 was born as team-working FPS and not 'I'm the most pro player in the game!11'. And that is just wonderful.  I say thanks to Valve and thanks to Gaben for making this fantastic game, which is my favorite.  Thanks a lot.  FINAL VOTE:  Gameplay: 10/10  Sounds and music: 9/10  Graphic: 9/10 (It's quite old but I like that style)  (Sorry for my bad English, but I'm from Italy!)    ",

Plus custom game mods like Slender Fortress, Freak Fortress and Death Run make the game twice as better. So I'll just point out the negatives.   Explosive spam.  It is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way. Kudos  Short Circuit.  It was fun while it lasted.   Crutch weapons/shields and overall annoyance.  Black Box/Concheror. Darwin's Shield. Reserve Shooter. Beggar's Bazooka. Vaccinator pairs. Degreaser combos. Despite naming these, I bet all of us use them anyway.

But what you don't get is that you're gaining much assistance as well from the rest of your teammates that is providing much said and needed push. Do the team a favour. Heal everyone (at least those who respect you).    People not understanding the difference between Boot Camp and Mann Up mode. The essence of Mann Up mode is to use the most effective loadouts, have a organized team of each class and to get through wave by wave. If you want to mess around, there is Boot Camp.   Lag compensation.  This takes the cake. Shots will seem off and you'll most definitely have those moments where you either got sniped through a wall or railed through the wall by the Heavy's curving mini-gun bullets. You thought you got past that wall, but you didn't on their screen. Seeing as I play Scout, it's something I notice on a daily basis, specifically against heavies. It's just all lag compensation. Curious to know more about it, I recommend googling it.   Critical hits.  It's either you get lucky or outlucked. If it's a issue for players, you'll have to search for those servers that host non-crit settings as the known popular public servers don't. There can be humor in it, but not when it's so frequent. Either way, critical hits are random pokes of not fun and it ruin the results of good matches.   Servers not tolerating class balance.  Not everyone wants to play in a server infested with engineers and mini-sentries/sentries all over the place. Or more than 2-3 demomen spamming stickies everywhere. Whatever the scenario is, this slides right into lack of teamwork and coordination. Things may never get done the right way, so your best bet is to probably just find another server.   Try to get a fair team scramble going and all of the average to good players may quickly go to spectator mode to restack again. We are no angels to that. Who doesn't want to be on the better team?   Closing comments...  Although all of that is what's to dislike about TF2, you'll somehow just find a way to see pass through it all and enjoy the game for what it is. Make some friends, find a favorite server and avoid the awful memes if you can.",

            "review_text": "It's time I wrote a honest review for Team Fortress 2. This is just my opinion based on my experiance with Team Fortress 2 and why after 1,290 hours I quit, so please don't hate on it because it's different from your own opinion. This is going to be somewhat long of a review, so don't be suprised that you'll have to read multiple paragraphs.   When I first came to TF2, I had so much fun with the game. I couldn't believe a game so old looks as if it barely aged a day. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, everything handles smoothly, and no weopon or class being greater than another. Although some weopons and classes can be annoying to deal with, they are not truly overpowered, you just need to find a strategy to deal with the weopon or class (also a tip: stock weopons are the best stat wise, but there are very few exceptions). I could have any loadout of weopons of my choosing then just play a match. Under the otherwise salty and rude players, I found some of the most honest and kind people I've ever met. Ziggy, Jake, Chuckles, Ash, Alex, Fatalia, Cider, Speg, Bruce, and the list goes on and on. These are some people I don't know how I would live without them, I honestly do not deserve their kindness. I mentioned a lot of people because it's true, you will meet so many new people, actual kind and caring people.   But, there is a reason I do not recommend this game. I finally got my first australium weopon and my first unusual, I spent so much money to get them, which is not even including the countless hats, stranges, killstreak weopons, taunts, ect I had already bought. I looked at my australium and unusual on my Medic for which I mained at the time and thought 'Eh, doesn't look good enough' and planned to buy better unusuals and better australiums and then go for collectors items. It took me a while to realize it, but it simply won't stop. Hats and australiums and all the countless variations of weopons do not make you a better player, they are not necissary for you to play the game. You will never have the best hat or best looking weopon. I wouldn't stop buying these useless cosmetics to further boost my ego. To realize just how much of a narcissist I became to have the most beautiful inventory and glammorize myself. It's an addiction that won't stop. You will look at your hats and realize that you don't have enough. How long will it take for you to hit that peak of items? How long will it take to realize all you bought were just useless textures, particles, and movements? For which, what will happen when you reach that peak of weopons and realize all the time and money you wasted? It took me so long to realize I spent too much money. I sold everything to end the addiction, that's why my inventory is just a wasteland of a former player.   If you plan to play TF2 for trading and profit, I don't recommend that either. The game is slowly dying and so is the economy. The next few updates will foreshadow the fate of TF2. If this further shows TF2's future death, the economy will go down with it. Meaning money invested in trading will just be lost. This game has just been milked to death in the last couple updates to keep it's playerbase and gain more money. TF2 is still one of the most played games on steam, but I can't say TF2 will hold that spot in the next few years. TF2 has greatly changed in the last few updates. Leading to matches and matchmaking feeling like a chore rather than the fun experience it was meant to be. TF2 has grown stale to me. These updates from all the way from End of The Line to Meet Your Match have further induced this staleness I feel and why so many players have left. No update has hyped me since Invasion. I don't find TF2 fun anymore, the magic is gone.   If you still are content with playing TF2, please, please do not spend your money. Just play for what's left of the silly gameplay and just have fun. Just play to meet new people hopefully people who mean just as much to you as the people I met mean to me. Please just don't get over hyped or spend money. Just enjoy the friends you'll meet and what's left of this game. Good bye old friend.",

After 2,000 hours spent blowing people up, setting people on fire, beating people to death with my bare fists, pushing a large explosive device in a mining cart along a track, trading hats for pieces of metal, and being riddled with bullets by a heat-seeking automatic turret - I think it's safe to say Team Fortress 2 is a pretty fun game.  Never gets old, fun to team up, or even duel your friends, and there's always more content around the corner.

As of the meet your match update, I'm yet to find a match where there isn't atleast 1 guy using lm@obox spinhax. This, paired with all the people whom are protective of said cheaters (I recently got kicked for literally pointing out that there was a spy with infinite cloak duration and backstabbing people while invisible, which was 100% true mind you) makes for the perfect cancer milkshake.  Trust a TF2 veteran, who's been playing since 2008, when I say that this game is dead. There is no reason to play it anymore with stuff like Paladins and Overwatch around. They do a much better job at the whole 'competitive team based shooter' thing, then Valve trying to shoehorn it into TF2 due to the success of said games.",

Yearly Christmas &amp; Halloween updates, large to medium content updates throughout the year, bugs crushed within weeks, and smaller updates sprinkled in. This game's longevity is certainly one of it's many strengths.  As an FPS with so many weapons and features, it remains extremely comprehensive and balanced (Regardless of what most players say). Weapons are added every now and then, and current weapons' stats are always under inspection for balance issues. The control is extremely tight as all source games are, movement always seems fluent and never clunky. The skill ceiling for movement/mobility is extremely high and allows for lots of very tricky moves (eg. Rocket/sticky jumping, sentry jumping, strafing, etc..) Generally the skill ceiling for TF2 is very, very high; with almost 3,000 hours at the time of posting this i am nowhere near the skill level of more experianced players.  The community is still strong and persistant as the game ages and brings in new players. An overall friendly and welcoming community awaits new players, as well as a thriving competitive scene in both Europe and the States. Not to mention the incredible fan-created artwork and short films on youtube and other sites. TF2 has an incredibly involved trading scene which was born from the staggering amount of hats and cosmetic items that you can get. The trading scene can be brutal at times, but nothing quite stands up to the feeling of getting a sweet new item after spending time trading up for it. (Oh and did i mention you can sell TF2 items for PayPal cash if you're advanced enough?)  In summation, Team Fortress 2 is a game for the ages. This game has something for everyone if you look for it, and you'll undoubtedly meet some amazing people and make new friends.",

            "review_text": "I'm gonna be honest, as I write this, my heart breaks with every word typed.   Tf2 used to be a wonderful game. Even A year ago it was the pinnacle of class-based shooters. Fun, fast paced, team-oriented, and easy to pick up/put down for new or busy players.  But now?  Its like seeing your father or mother slowly break down into an alchoholic   Going from once trusting and loving Valve to....this, whatever this is!  What I'm talking about is, of course, this backwards stream of updates that have been coming out. -We were promised updates to game modes, weapons, and maps, and all we got were reskins and hats. -We were promised better weapons balanced for the most powerful weapons in the game Instead? A buff. Something to even further ruin the day.  -Its just not fun even more, to hear '♥♥♥♥ you' when asking for less snipers  'Deal with it or quit' they say, like a repeating, drunken piper. -You want more weapons and maps? Too bad, you get weapon skins and Hats! -Whats that? A bug you say? Lets fix it 3 months later, have some more weapons skins, now shut up and good day! -The new ranking system is just that; a rank. Theres no reward for playing offense, defense or tank.  - Hope you dont like to heal, because only snipers and spies will be your deal -Finally, and perhaps worse of all, are the half-asses updates that actually BREAK the game. Its not that hard to do something less lame. Perhaps pulling an ear to your friends, families, and peers would help, BUT ALAS! They look as us, shrug, and yelp; 'Get over it, its our game, now give us more money, ignore the pain!'    Thank you  Edit: for those who don't like my rhyme, what I'm basically saying is Tf2 has become a garbage pail of its former self. Valve has shown countless times it does not care about this game anymore, especially with its updates that end up breaking the game more than usual. Not only that, but Valve seems to completely ignore and ♥♥♥♥ on the player. In this last year, we have 1 new sniper weapon, 1 new scout weapon, and 2 demo weapons that nobody uses because they are basically useless in comparison to the other weapons, yet Valve has only done 1 thing about it: Buffed a weapon called the phlogistinator, even though that's the OPPOSITE of what people want. Also, they put the 'free to play' tag on Tf2 but it is certainly NOT f2p. The whole premise of the game is character customization, yet unless you pay money you're not gonna do that. Hell, you can't even play the co-op mode without paying money. In the 1,300 hours I have played, only 2 items I have received for free.   The community is god awful. I get it, it's a casual shooter, but I shouldn't have to BEG people to play a medic or an engineer on a 12-person team. I shouldn't have to pick up the slack of my team (as shouldn't anyone) because of incompetence. Now, this isn't saying that new players shouldn't play, but even a new player should have SOME level of cognitive function. Aka: I shouldn't have to stalk a teammate because they don't know how to look up or look behind them. Or tell a medic to heal instead of fight. Or tell THAT THIRD ♥♥♥♥ING SNIPER TO NOT BE A SNIPER. Other than that, there are people who just DONT play the game. The stand in spawn or stand in the middle of the map over, and over, and over, and over.   And not to mention the kids, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, idiots, and trolls in the game. You thought COD was bad with kids? Try 18+'s with mindsets of a kid. Or a kid who literally just SCREAMS into the mic for no good reason. Yes you can mute these people but why do I have to? Hell, during last years Halloween valve had to force people to STOP killing each other in order to actually play the min objective: killing a boss. That gives an item. A FREE ITEM FROM A BOSS. Are these people stupid or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? You decide.   If I were an update tester for Tf2 right now, I'd leave a sticky note that just says 'fix it'",

Balanced teams happen once in a blue moon, classes and weapons are getting buffed/nerfed at random for reasons only Valve knows, the only new content being added is made by the community (in some rare occasions by Valve and when it is it seems to be pretty terrible, just look at the Carlton taunt, no music! They made music for the conga, the kazotsky kick and the mannrobics, why can't they make a new song for the Carlton taunt ? Do you have any idea how awkward it is to dance without music ?), new weapons happen once every few years and the community's become stressed, displeased, tired and demotivated.

Six years of my life have been spent with this game, and right now I'm mourning its loss. No overpriced Valve emoticon can adequately capture the raw sadness I'm feeling at this moment. I really want to recommend this game. I really, really do... but I just can't. If you asked me in 2011 and 2012, I'd say that TF2 is an absolutely brilliant, amazing, and fun game. In 2013 I'd say the same but with less enthusiasm. In 2014 I might hesitate a bit before giving that answer.  Over these past few years, I've watched the game slowly deteriorate from Valve's laziness, ineptitude, and just poor decisions. Community servers are what made TF2 great. They're why I stuck with this game. Without community servers, TF2 is just another in a very long line of objective-based first-person shooters. Community servers are where you meet people. They're where you make lasting connections. They're where you fill up your Steam friends list. And now? They're gone. Deserted.  As I'm typing this, TF2 is in the middle of its biggest event of the year: Scream Fortress. At this exact moment, TF2 has only 6x more players than Counter-Strike 1.6. CS 1.6 is from an era where Valve built games to last. CS 1.6 has no Valve servers. It has no matchmaking. It has no hats or microtransactions. It just has its community. A community which is desperately clinging to a 16-year-old game and is doing pretty damn well for itself.  TF2's community is long gone. All the YouTubers have moved on. I found exactly one populated server tonight running plr_hightower_event, one of the most popular Halloween maps, and it had fast respawn enabled.  Community servers are what made TF2 great back in the early days. They're what primed TF2 to go free-to-play. Valve servers were only added back then to handle the big surge of new players in the Uber Update. If you asked a 'TF2 player' back then of their opinion of Valve servers, they would scoff down their nose at you.  I poured my heart and soul into this game. I spent countless hours building server plugins which were at one point running on thousands of TF2 servers worldwide. That drive is now gone because TF2 just doesn't offer anything to me anymore. I really, really want it to, but it doesn't. I would give nearly anything to get the old TF2 back.  TF2's community is gone, and I'm just devastated.  TF2 is gone.  I want it back, but I'm afraid that at this point, it's too late.",

The mechanics that everything is built on? Gotta say, hella good. The interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus, but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions. Like, 'what if I ran a melee medic?' 'or a melee heavy?' 'What could make this more fun to play?' It is a great game, with great appeal, but most importantly the mechanics are fun. Plus who could argue with the price?   Now if they would just do more with the magic spells, and medieval mode, and the bosses, then I would have no complaints.",

The kills and deaths records in casual matchs but no assistance record (yeah yeah, medic kinda looks like sh*t then with their 0 kills - 40 deaths) The matches are very stressful, the team with leaving players is completly penalised and the match only last for one map, which means you have to go for another 10 minute of research after this. MvM cannot be played anymore because of the 'leave/rejoin' that no longer allow you to press esc to cancel it, comunity servers are awful, always the same maps with stupid plugins or instarespawns, ads everywhere and some server that make afk players bots, yes that makes them stupid but thats also a legal aimbot with 360° sight. This updates added a few 'balances' some really good ones : the sun on a stick, the eureka effect (still not worht using but thats a start) and some unjustified nerfs : the vaccinator is now a potato because of pyros ability to remove 25% shield. The pyro have been buffed ways too much, a w m1 pyro can take out a heavy medic combo alone, probably die in the process but he can deal the 450 health of the heavy in less that 2 seconds. In it's current state the game is not even fun to play, the matchmaking is the worse update valve ever made to tf2.  Until some changes, i'm not recommending that game.",

With out a doubt the recent Meet your Match update was the absolute WORST in history, worse than Tough Break by a country mile.  First let's talk about the smallest part, the weapon changes, Heavy nerfed AGAIN, useless addition to the Shortstop, zero nerf to the Crit-a-Cola and the fact Valve had to be talked out of BUFFING the Reserve Shooter is outstanding.  Making us choose between the two weakest classes in the game to get a update is another idiotic thing, just buff and fix the both of them we don't need a silly competition.  Next let's talk about how the new casual/comp modes are terrible; the wait time, the negligible punishment for leavers, the amount of hackers and just general terribleness from Casual and Comp is again, outstanding. And the removal of Quickplay is in my mind the BIGGEST mistake Valve has ever made in one of their games.   Good Community servers are few and far between the most heaping pile of trash i've ran into, x10, Minecraft, Trade, Saxton Hale, premium servers the list goes on. And whenever a good community server is found it's completely empty.  The TF2 community needs to make a statement to Valve that we will no longer have our game be worked on 'if they want to' the game needs attention and it needs it now. Overwatch, while not the exact same game as TF2, has enough similarities for people to leave TF2 and start playing that, which is a shame that Valve is just letting one of their biggest and formely best games happen to it.  As of right now, i can't recommend this game in the state it's in. Please Valve, communicate with us, talk to us, we'll give as much feed back as you need. Please Valve don't let TF2 actually die.",

Definitely THE best f2p game out there. If this was 3 years ago, I would've easily recommended this game. But now, I don't know if I can, despite its greatness. A few things to note: -The hitreg is VERY ♥♥♥♥y. -There are a fair amount of netcode issues with the game. -Its hard to get into competitively. -It is now EXTREMELY BLOATED. The first 3 are obvious, but I'd like to talk about my last point for a minute.  Valve has milked this game for all it's worth, and rightly so, they've made huge profit off this game. But they pushed it a little TOO far with the path they've taken with this game. It's extremely bloated, I get really bad frames, which is odd considering I can get atleast 100 fps on GTA V with near max settings, but I barely get 100 on lowest in TF2. They've made the game run like crap with the copious amounts of cosmetics and weapon skins. It's stupid, and has made the game nearly unplayable.   Tf2 used to run pretty good, and I had a good time with it. The game will forever hold a place in my heart. But it runs like trash, has gotten very stale from the lack of REAL content (note real: not skins or hats) and ValvE has humped this game till it bled, and it shows. I can't say the community is healthy either. The economy for items went down the drain as well.  I really can't recommend this game for anything more than quick enjoyment. I loved this game, but I really can't look at in the same light anymore.  TL;DR- Game is good, but runs bad, has a diminishing community, bad hitreg/ netcode, Valve has milked it for all it's worth.

Even though it is a free to play game and you can certainly have fun staying free to play, 'F2P' I do recommend that you buy an item from the in game 'mann co store', only buy a single item and you will be upgraded to a premium account, you will find better items, be able to trade as well as many other features. There is so much more to tell about this game but I alone cannot say it all, you must play this game to trully understand it, if you need tips or help I can and will try my best!

According to backpack.tf more than $350,00 in cash with cosmetics, australiums and taunts and you ask why? Well, because I like that game. Recently I bought Overwatch Origins editon (the expensive one). Its a great game, but the game didn't captivate me that much. It doesn't have the 'magic' Tf2 has. Play with friends, troll new players, Become movable dispensers (aka Hoovies with sandvish), meet G.E.W.P, Enter in whatever server you would like, get auto-balanced few times (but you know, at the end we all laught about those things). But with this new idea of how Public servers (pubs) work, the time we spend trying to find a server, without being able to change your team, they ruined the unique gameplay that Tf2 have to offer. Really? Real losers and winners? If I wanna play for real I'd go play on competitive. Not in a server to have FUN. I agree that on COMPETITIVE those news modifications are a good thing, But in a Pub?? Really??? Probably I'll come back to overwatch after this update, unfortunately. ",

            "review_text": "Team Fortress 2 vs. Overwatch   TL;DR  at the bottom  Disclaimer: I have not played Overwatch. The review is based solely one what I know from my friends and watching a ♥♥♥♥♥on of streams/youtube videos. What I say here should not be taken as fact. If you have a conflicting opinion on what I say here, feel free to state it in the comments below.  It should also be noted that I have over 3,000 hours in TF2 and can be trusted to make a relatively accurate assessment of the game.    For most, if not all TF2 players, the figurative elephant in the room that players are uncomfortable to address is Overwatch. I don't blame them. It's a fantastic game developed by Blizzard, a company known for it's MMOBAs and not first person shooters. However they've seemed to hit this ball out of the park with Overwatch. Most dedicated TF2 players (including myself) are a little salty if not tilted at the triple A title for taking the spotlight for class-based first person shooters. They are also upset due to big names playing more Overwatch or simply leaving TF2 altogether. Some examples may include FROYO Clockwork, Muselk, and Ster.   The problem lies with people immediately seeing it and comparing it to TF2. Yes, on the surface it is very easy to see the similarities is shares with TF2 and the developers have openly stated that they took inspiration from TF2.    BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT GAMES, I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH!      Overwatch relies more on teamwork and strategy and less on mechanical skill and movement that must be practiced over time. Most players note that they tend to master most classes after 100-300 hours of playing. It shines the most when players coordinate together, swapping heroes (classes) to counter the enemy, and predicting the enemies movement. It unsurprisingly plays more like one of Blizzard's MMOs than a first person shooter.   TF2 relies much more on practiced and mechanical skill although it does have a very strong reliance on teamwork and coordination. Skills like rocket jumping, trickstabbing, and reflecting projectiles all take a considerable amount of time to master and encourage players to be well versed in 1 or 2 classes. Thus, people tend to 'main' a specific class. For example,  one of  the most notable Soldier/Scout mains is FROYO B4nny is well known for being one of the best players in the game with over 15,000 hours. In Blizzard's Overwatch, people tend to main a hero less and main a hero-class like 'Tank' or 'Defense.'    TL;DR  TF2 and Overwatch, although seeming very similar, are different games that cater to different players. Both are still amazing games but comparing them is like comparing your favorite pizza to your friend's favorite soda. Obviously, there will be differences even though both are extremely enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "After spending around 1800 hours of playtime with this game, enduring at least six major game updates (within about one to two years of span), making many friends within the game, and having much bullsh*t with this game, it's about time I put it to rest.  Many times I've played this game, and questioned: why am I still playing this? After many scams, many encounters with aimbots and overall d*cks, many crappy unboxes and MvM loot, why do I still play this game? It's quite simple actually. It's addicting.  Team Fortress 2 is a First-Person Shooter released 2007 for both consoles and PC via Steam. Unlike today, TF2 was a normal everyday game, you had to pay to get in, and to play online. In June 2011 however, Valve decided to make the game Free-to-Play. As for how the game recieves money now, ask Mann Co.'s front office. They can let you know that now 100% of this game's earnings come from the Mann Co. Store, likely for keys, cosmetics, taunts, and yes: even campaign passes.  I was introduced to it around of Christmas of 2014, or Smissmas if you wish to go by the TF2 Dictionary. And that was the last time we ever had a 'real' Smissmas update. Now all we have are just Gun Mettle related updates and Meet your Match.   I love this game, and I hate it at the same time. Though, while my love has been strong for it, I just don't see myself supporting this game anymore. Let's get some things straight. The latest updates haven't been that great. Also the community, as creative and kind as it is at times, has to be the most cancerous thing I've ever witnessed. I can understand if it used to be such a good place, but with 9-year old kids going around, swearing to their hearts' content on an MvM game abusing the votekick option? It's gotten a bit too far. If anything, the people who downvoted this review just because it was a 'not recommended' review are the kind of people that prove my point about the community being cancerous. It makes No Man's Sky incident a joke. I'm not saying all of you guys are bad, as there are some good people. And there are some good parts of the community. There's just more bad than good in this situation, especially considering the many great people we've lost during the Meet Your Match update, such as MrPaladin.   Next, let's have a talk about Unboxing. You see all those players with Unusuals around ya? Either they were lucky and got some via unboxing, or they decided to buy some off of the market or some trading site. Same thing for the Australium weapons. What point am I trying to make? When a person says that the richest player is often the most skilled, it's not true..unless they happen to have a crap ton of hours, such as 9,000. I've only scored around 1,800 hours. And believe me, that is a long time. The unboxing itself though, is rather..picky to say the least. Not once in my entire TF2 life, have I unboxed an unusual. Not once. The most expensive thing I've unboxed was a CAPPER. 6$. Now, multiply the cost of a single key, 2.50$, by at least 115. Also add in account the MvM tickets I've used, the campaign tickets (count the amount of MvM tours I've cleared) I've bought and used, and items I have bought off the market. That's right. I have spent around $450+ on this game. And I could have done a crap ton of more things with that money than just buy a chance at getting a $100 item instead of something worth a few cents.   Now, the game itself. As the game gets updated and updated, more and more balances are made. Up to the point where some weapons are unusable or are just cr*p. Take the Sniper's only unlockable SMG for example. That thing used to have gotten Mini-crits by kills. However, they changed it to were it's a personal jarate. What?  Just..what?  I mean it doesn't even last as long as Jarate, so it makes the weapon ever so useless. And we can't forget about the phlog, right? Where the weapon is literally godmode for the Pyro if backed by a single medic? My point is, the game is broken. And not the fun kind it used to be. It's just a disaster.   A brief history of my time on TF2:  Smissmas 2014 - I like all the festive stuff.  End of the Line - What's going on?  Gun Mettle - I like the contracts, but not the skins and new crates.  Scream Fortress VII - I am heavily dissapointed for this to be my first experience with Halloween.  Tough Break - 'Are you freakin kidding me?!' No more Smissmas, Gun Mettle reskin, aaaand Spells are dead. Rip player inventories. At least the skins look cool this time.  Meet Your Match - I can say was an..okay update, ignoring the fact Valve enforced Casual Mode as a thing, and it tried to compete with Overwatch instead of doing it's own thing. Don't ask. I only play on TF2 Community Servers now, and it still hasn't changed my perspective on the game.   My point being, despite Valve listening to the majority (despite deciding to shove competetive down our throats in the form of 'Casual'), I just feel like that this game is giving me the middle finger. Everything dispises me in this game. Random crits, autobalance (which by the way is not only frequent for me, but it also is non-existant from Casual and Competetive), and even the community. If people question why I think everyone hates me, this game is the answer.   At it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. And I do mean anyone.  The music is great, the art and look is great, and even the ideas of the game are great.. ..but the balancing is awful, the game is glitched as hell (and not 'fun' as it used to be with the exploits), and just everything is a train wreck. Worse than Digital Homicide failing as a game company, I should add.  Oh, and also prepare for Pyromania 2.0: Team Pyro won. And at least three quarters of the team has '#TeamPyroWins!' on their username. Very offended.   ..however, there's one thing I must mention that I didn't add into the original review. As I said, it was the root of me when I came to Steam. It helped me form friends, make enemies, and even develop skills that eventually helped me later on with different games. I'm practically a good sniper on Borderlands because of my skill as the Sniper class on this game.  Everyone has different experiences. Some even are to be cherished and loved. However, I just suffered and suffered. While I had some smiles and laughs out of this game, I had more scars and tears shed within those 1,800 hours I've earned and the hundreds of dollars I've lost. And I just wish I could have the time I've suffered back, to have done something else that's enjoyable.",

This is a really fun gamemode that reminds me a lot of Tower Defense games. But you don't place towers around the map, rather you as a team are the towers mowing down enemy waves.  But this mode is unplayable! Trying to join servers via matchmaking is an impossible task as you will always be greeted by a prompt 'round is already running'. You either have the choice to re enter or leave the server. Re entering will only result in this prompt being displayed to you again and again!  But hey, you can always use the server browser to join servers! No you really can't for MvM since majority of them don't allow you to join in any other way than via Valve's crappy matchmaking.   I don't get how a game that ran so smooth and perfect can be made so broken in just a few messy updates!

The many different weapons makes for good changes in pace and strats, and, of course, cosmetics. It gives you many different loadouts and play styles. You could even add mods for more playability. There are micro transactions but you only need to buy from the mann co store if you need to be premium otherwise you can save up metal and stock refined metal to trade or buy items at a cheaper price on the Steam Community market.  But I enjoy the community servers and different game modes Payload, Payload Race, SD Doomsday, Pass time, Versus Saxton hale, Randomizer, x10, CTF, koth, Control Point, mann vs machine, surf, trade servers, mann power, Halloween mode maps, and much more. And don't forget now there is competitive and casual play as well, if your interested.  There is a skill ceiling in this game that keeps you practicing on specific classes you play as and has a steep learning curb with teqniques like stair stabs, surfing, and rocket/sticky/sentry jumping.  Although many people say this game is dead or down right terrible I disagree. Sure it has some problems but it has a very good Community with big events like Tip of the Hats.

Team Fortress 2 is the best game i have ever played, and the reason i think it's such a great game is becasue it's not like the typical FPS games like Battle Field and Call Og Duty. Instead of a realistic FPS game, valve made the Team fortress 2 graphics more cartoon-ish. Also a thing to mention is that you can customise your character's miscs and hats.

Heck, you even get penalised for leaving a match! I think this is outragous to have such a sudden and drastic change to this game. I was never into the competitive scene, otherwise i might aswell just play csgo!

        {
            "review_text": "Let's start with the fact, that I have never write any review, so don't be too harash with mine, please.  Team Fortress 2. What can be said about this game? Some people might just look at it and say: 'Regular FPS. You play with maybe even 100+ people a day, and shoot to win.' Or is it?  What I like mostly about TF2, is the fact that everything there is build on the TEAMWORK. After all, this is called 'TEAM Fortress 2', not 'Deathmatch Fortress 2'. Playing as a lone wolf will lead you to no where, and even eventually make you rage quit from playing this game. For good.  It's not about your high score, or how many kills you get at the end of the round. (altough it still motivate you to fight more and shows that you are the experienced player to others) It's all about doing the objective together with your team, to win the game. And every new game there is completely different than previous one, so working together as a team is really important with every challenge that comes with every new game mode, team members and map the game is going on of course.  So we already know, this game is all about team work, and doing current game objective. Got it? Good, and keep it that way!  Let's go with the next thing - weapons! Even though there's not many of them, as the cosmetic items (that would be something) there's still a lot of them, to pick and choose from. And most of the weapons usually change to way of playing your current class, so it makes the game even more interesting and challenging. We have weapons that heal or overheal you on killing your opponent, slow down enemies who are shot, gives you speed boost, hurt enemy after attacking him... the list is long, every weapon have it's pros and cons, so everyone can choose, try out every weapon and stick with it, as this style of fighting with it fits him most. Thus makes your gameplay completely different everytime you join on a random server, with new random people.  More guns = more fun. Check them out, and find your style. That's our conclusion here. One tip though - every time you will get a new weapon, don't think you have advanced to a next level or something and this new weapon is way better than the previous one! Carry on...  Classes you're playing! There are 9 playable classes in game, avalible from the beggining, so there's no any 'This class avalible after reaching that level.' No. You can play as who do you want, from the beggining. So you can try out every game style and see which one fits you most, as with every class you're playing completely diffrently than with previous one. So, the classes are: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and (my favourite) Spy. Every class have it's pros and cons, just like the weapons you can get so the choice of your favourite one are a little easier. For example - Scout is the fastest one of all the classes, can make double jumps and even capture points 2 times faster than anyone else. But he is really easy to kill in battle, unless you're good at dodging incomming spam of bullets and rockets. Much better for a frontal attack are classes like Soldier, armed with his rocket launcher and the possibility to do a 'Rocket Jump' to help him reach bigger distances in a short time, due to the fact he's really slow. But that's just a short example of everything that each class is avalible of. And honestly? Too lazy to write down all of them, that's all... meh.  Worth to mention, that every class have it's own personality, which makes them a bit more cooler and interesting to play with. Another example? Fine. Scout is pretty much kind of a cocky guy, who likes to annoy others, and think that every girl wants him, and every guy wish to be like him. Soldier is a stereotypical example of an American patriot, who most likely lost all his brain cells durning WW2. Heavy is a very calm and serious guy, until his minigun starts to spin and the battle starts. Then he's like a wild, angry bear, that hates people. And so it goes as well, with the other 6 classes.  So, 9 different mercs for a usually 12-24 teams. Sounds cool? Because it is... that is, until most of them are only Spies or Snipers.  Exactly, most of the players think that this game is like CoD - thus they go full sniper force, believing they have nailed everything. No, no, NO! This game is nothing like CoD! A team full of snipers, will never win. I was once in a team where out of 10 players we had 8 snipers, one spy and a soldier which was me. So, I think you can say how that round went? (inb4 MLG jokes) So, what I mean is - teamwork is important, we know that. But, when there's not enough classes that will provide enough firepower for the team, the teamwork won't help you much, or does not exist there at all.  Okay, time to move on to...  HATS! This is something completely random, that makes this game unique. In this game, you can wear on every class a nice and fancy hat, or other cosmetic, that will make you look diffrent from the others. Here's my question - can you wear a hat in every other FPS, than Team Fortress 2? No. Or dance Conga? Of course not. Or being a total annoying brat and taunting after every kill, no matter how much skill you put into your kill? Of course not! Another reason why TF2 is so unique, and why we love it so much.  Okay, slowly getting tired of thinking what to poot here. So, conclusion time!  Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game, unique in her own beautiful way and great to play. I recommend playing it, together with your friends! 'But they have no money...' This game's free! Just download, learn how to play and get good!  The only thing that makes me really angry about this game are most of the time unbalanced teams, the autobalance curse in the worst possible moment of the round, or the fact the prices are getting higer in its shop...",

(I think they should increase these prices, or they might run out items. I already bought this item 26 times in case they ever do run out of hats)    Some things I did not like about the simulator.  - You get these weird metal hats drops called “weapons”, which you can’t even wear on your head!

The more hats you have in your backpack, the better player you are. It's a proven fact.     Now I am sure other reviewers have mentioned my great idea to success, however, I am far too lazy to read other people's reviews. Maybe after I have a few more hours played I will try the phlog pyro trick.    Until then, I leave you with 3 thoughts: First, this game is free, stop reading reviews and try it for yourself. Secondly, find a few servers to favorite, and blacklist the ones with 9yr old admins and kids who get mad when you left click better than them. They are cancer and will ruin your experience.

This is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game.  10/10, would wear hats again.",

            "review_text": "Hi  While I can't say I have clocked many hours with this game since I only just started playing I will say that I WAS having fun, I am a pretty casual gamer and after perusing the Community servers since most either only have the same map 24/7 or have ads etc etc and not really finding anything I like I tried multiplayer/quickplay and instantly fell in love with Attack/defense.   I was getting the hang of a few classes and loved looking forward to coming home from work to unwind with it, The map's rotated every now and then which freshened the matches and players could come and go as they pleased resulting in some challenging, some easy going and some downright FUN matches.... Then the update came.... now don't get me wrong I actually think that competitive is a great idea FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO PLAY IT! But removing the quickplay option to replace it with casual? Bad move.... I know Valve are working to fix some of the issues with it but personally my new experiance is this..  .Get into a game .Spend half that game dead due to cheaters/hackers. .Get disconnected after each match and have to q all over again (not so bad now since the wait time seems to have severally dropped but still annoying. .Get annoyed with the pressure and stress of a match and go play something else.  Casual should be just that casual. But it even annouces at the beginning of a 'casual match' PREPARE TO COMPETE! To me the new 'casual feature' just seems like a watered down version of competitive mode. It was much more fun as quickplay, I dont care about levels, I dont care about ranking up. I just want to play for fun!  So would I recommend this game? A few days ago I would have said absoutly, it was fun, and full of imaginative and quirky characters. Now though? I would not recommened unless you like playing competitively because thats pretty much all you can do.  Please valve give us back quickplay!",

The game itself offers nine classes. Each of them fills a different role in the team. By the time you play, you will also get unlocks for each character. That basically means that there are multiple ways of playing the game. You can even put yourself a goofy loadout together if you prefer to play less serious. At the same time, the game shines because it is really unique in a way. It is full of gimmicks and the playstyle is very different from most shooter games. There is no Team Deathmatch and no normal Assault Rifle gun etc but exactly that is the reason why the game is so good. It offers way more than from what you get from all these repetitive shooter games that essentially play the same nowadays. Many different weapons, customizeable characters, taunts, unique gamemodes and gameplay, mods, a trading system... what else do you need? I do belive that is the reason why the game already survived so long and it still gets updated. In a nutshell, I suggest you to jump right into it if you haven't already. It's free.

This game is what pulled me from Xbox to PC so why do I just feel pity for this game running on for so long when I used to want to watch it become an unstoppable titan on PC with no end in sight? I think it stems back to what I'd call the 'peak' of TF2 (In my time of being around) which I felt was Love &amp; War because I remember how the game that was just becoming a little too stale got the biggest injection of life and fun with new taunts, weapons and all around great memories. However I noticed something off after a week or so, the community was becoming 2 factions and I had never seen this before, one side wanting to conga and party the other wanting a hardcore pub server every match. I kept on playing though. When a trailer named 'End of the Line' came out my hype was beyond containing and I thought up so many weapons I've seen that will possibly come to life on update day. I had so many thoughts of how this is the update to end the game, one last bang with everything and anything we could want or need. When Finally on December 8th we were hit with a crushing reality where this update that had so much hype for turned into a simple cosmetic update and I was crushed. I kept playing though. With a pit in my stomach the new update rolled out with quite a split, Gun Mettle. CS:GO skins in TF2 and people thought the world was ending and to top it off this update was a pay to play update to start the campaign. However I was loving every second of the new group tanut and the Snowplow map, not to mention I was in love with some skins. Like all good things though I was quickly brought back down to sadness when Invasion hit. It had sounded like there would be new weapons and a new game mode from all the hype. The game mode was average at most and the reskins turned my love for the game to anger and I left for Payday for quite a while. I returned midway in the Tough Break update when I saw a similar but different game. The magic was just gone for me at this point and soon enough other games caught my eye, mainly Overwatch. Where TF2 grew stale with me other people kept going. I full departure from TF2 was Meet Your Match when I felt as if TF2 changed so drastically to just compete with Overwatch's rapid growth in competitive play. Sure I've been reading and it looks like TF2 is back to how it's been for 9 years just with a different hat stacked on it's head again. I'm not saying you should quit TF2 because Overwatch is just better or anything. I just want to explain about how I broke away from this game and things I felt after 4 years on this game and many disappointments. So if you enjoy TF2 still then more power to you and if you hate TF2 with a burning passion then I don’t care about that either. All this review is for is to say my peace about TF2 before I’m done with it for good.",

It has one thing that most other first person shooters do not. Have a guess, go on! It's trading! Currently in the halloween event for 2016, TF2 is well known for its trading, cosmetics &amp; huge variety of items and things to equip.   Having played this game for over 500 hours, I must say it's impressive &amp; fun. Since it's currently the Halloween event, the merasmissions are very fun but can also take a while for some who have not done them before.   TF2 isn't one of those games where it is really complicated and confusing. Nope. I remember my first match in TF2 when I went for medic and actually surprisingly did well. Even without premium, TF2 can still be fun with the MVM boot camp Co-Op and there are so many different things to do on the community servers too! Deathrun, Saxton Hale, different MVM modes such as story mode, and loads more. This proves that TF2 is a true game that has so many options to play and explore.  So if you're on Steam and looking for a suitable F2P game that you think is worthy of your time, give TF2 a try. I guarantee you won't regret it.  Thank you for reading this review, Emporius  ",

In one years time, I've accumulated a little more than 3,000 hours. More time than I have sunk into any other game so far. The re-playability of this game is something you rarely see in an average First Person Shooter, and its charm is something that has kept its fanbase happy since the games release in 2007.    Some of the things that set this game apart from its rivals is its unique brand of humor, and its beautiful art style. In interviews with the games creators, it was explained that in development, they drew heavily from the art style of beloved American illustrator, Norman Rockwell. In this well thought out game, there are 9 classes to choose from, each with their own unique weapon arsenal, strengths and weaknesses, and personality. Scout, soldier, pyro, demo, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy.  Scout being a very frail, fast class with burst damage output at close range, he can also capture control 2 times as fast as the other classes. Soldier having balanced health and mobility, comfortably played in all situations. pyro being of lesser health, and balanced speed, allowing him to flank enemies and ambush them. Demo man with overwhelming damage output, lesser speed, and a fair amount of health. Heavy being the bullet sponge of the game, massive health, slow movement speed, and decent damage output. Engineer with the ability to construct buildings that will help allies, and hinder enemies with area denial. Medic being able to heal team mates back up to full health, sending them back into a fight. Sniper having the devastating ability to pick off enemies from a distance, but having the disadvantage of low health, and normal speed. And lastly the spy, able to become invisible, disguise as enemies, and one hit kill anyone, with the major disadvantage of low health, and close range combat.  When it comes to gameplay, this game is about as balanced as it gets. You start out the game already owning all the best weapons, and you slowly earn, or randomly receive items with different stats, better in one area, worse in another. The fact that everyone is given the most balanced weapons from the start, make this a game heavily based around skill. The hilarity of slapping someone with a fish, a ham, or a frying pan make the game enjoyable for more casual players, where as the mix of good art style, balanced weapons, and numerous tournament modes make it enjoyable for more serious players.   On the topic of serious game play, there are competitive gaming leagues from all over the world hosting tf2 tournaments and events. All with special objectives, rule sets, and banned item lists, making the outcome of each game different.  There are several divisions of skill, so even the best have something to work toward.  The economy of the game is something that has a controversy surrounding it. Although this games target audience is mature, young adults, several children find there way in. With so many children actively participating in a global scale open economy, it can lead to unbalances, unfortunate, and sometimes hilarious circumstances. Hats are what make the TF2 economy go around, everyone wants to find a hat that showcases exactly what they want their character to represent. Finding just the right hat, with just the right color, and possibly a special particle effect, can be rather expensive, making most people pour more money into pixelated headwear than is reasonable.   In the end, this is the most interesting, quirky, an beautiful game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. I recommend it to any gamer, and will continue to enjoy its charm for years to come.",

Awesome game for try our Teamwork to win on battle, And have been returned and got bored on pyro class ,head over my pointer to try scout class with killstreak gun and and its my favorite class till now. You can't just go soloing on the arenas, you need a great Teamwork to get in the good place like in the game title. Highly recommended this game at all first person shooter sequel, would try and should try this game! The first thing that you must know from this game is, This game was fully for free to play, doesn't valuable player can win at once you can just start with item drop to be the great one at battle but i'm not.  Let me tell some deep thing about this game, the grapich and texture on the game already at the top points and depend on how far you can handle it. There are two team you can join that is Red and Blu or Blue(mostly called it Blu). Many class that you can wanna be like Sniper, a burner, a medic, an heavy man, a spy class, or as a scout bring deadly itself small shotgun and more class that make you into the core. Many awesome map made by community and official creator, a Crowded server by player and official server make this game more enjoyable for in random gamer community. An stats detail about your gameplay to beat in some records, as much as achievement to unlock beat the average players and meet stranger and be a good team, all is about shoot and some teamwork require to win i need to say again. Few fun mode that you can play, the game always updated, so don't be minded is this game was old and bored, like in other day i check up on SteamCharts, almost got 70K player everyday! An active player every hours! don't think you're lonely, you can start your own story and friendship by just playing this game and be a good person, all will accepting you well. Grab your favorite class and combined item and start chillin with your friend for more fun!",

To all the destructive people out there play as the Soldier or the Demoman or the Pyro. For all those people who love to help out to be the team player, play some Medic or Engineer.   A little story I wrote for Team Fortress 2. Once upon a time, a little boy named Jimmy had finally got himself playing some 'Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2' and he said to himself. 'Gee, I wish people aren't so mean and hateful of other people!' and so Gaben flew into little Jimmy's window on a unicorn with laser eyes with armor made of Chuck Norris Beard hair, and so Gaben took little Jimmy on an little adventure into the world, of Team Fortress 2. He showed him ctf_2fort a magical place to live (if you are a maniac who has a barn full of guns.) and he showed him the magical-ness of Team Fortress 2. Little Jimmy couln't believe what is going on so he fell asleep and the next morning he gathered all his lunch money and bought himself so many hats he became! A hat lord! Something truely amazing!(Not) So he went on and bought even more which made Gaben very happy. The End  Basic Steps: Launch Team Fortress 2  Get on a server  Buy hats  Buy even more hats  Rename Team Fortress 2: 'Hat simulator'  Give it the 'Game of the Year award' fifty times  Eat  Sleep  Play  Anyways, to be mature about this.  Team Fortress 2 is a wonderful game which players can interact with each other. Either by relentlessly murdering them or just giving each other high fives. It has many game modes like Capture the Flag(Briefcase) or Control Points. It really gives players control over many things. There has been other things like custom community content or Mann vs. Machine. It also has many abilities to make players smarter. Each class requires you to play differently everytime. I would recemend Team Fortress 2 to many people. But I don't have that kind of communication. Although you'll first end up as a Free To Play you'll soon invest some cash into the game. Word of advice: If you get the Ghostly Gibus, Throw it away. People will criticize you for it. All of all things enjoy the game don't just mess around, time will fly way past your head if you do. But you might find yourself addicted to it after a while.  That has been my review hope it helped you!",

This game has brightened my life for the better because of all the friends I've made, the wide variety of maps, weapons and custom gamemodes, the many, many, many dumb and completely irrational ideas in our world take place in Team Fortress 2.  For example, Spycrabs, Pyrosharks, beating a portly Russian man with a baseball bat as he eats a sandwich. There are so many things to look forward to in this godly-yet-dumb-as-all-living-hell game that will have you laughing your head off in a matter of minutes.  Team Fortress 2 is constantly updated (albiet with some controversial nerfs or buffs) and every time you hop on after a major overhaul of new stats for your favourite weapons, or a new class being able to wear your favourite hat is so refreshing and exhilarating. The community behind the games works so hard to create new and fun content for this game that is well over 8 years old.  Team Fortress 2 is such a lively game with so many wacky moments that make you just want to chuckle.  And I wouldn't want it any other way.",

It makes no sense whatsoever! Competitive, good luck trying to get on that. Mann Vs. Machine hasn't been touched thank god. Oh yeah, try and play the ONE gamemode you want to play... wait... nope, you have to have at least 2 selected to actually get on a normal game, so you have a 50/50 chance to play what you want. Like I said prior, I LOVE TF2, but this update is crap, so any new players wanting to play this game would see this update and think, 'Why do people love this, this is horrible!'

            "review_text": "I have not played this game nearly as long as everyone else (at the time of this review), but I feel I still have some insight of value for anyone considering picking it up.  One of the biggest appeals I can see with this game (other than the fact that it's free) is that there is a tremendously high skill cap. There is always something new for you to learn, be it rocket jumping, good sentry placement, or just knowing where all the healthkits are. Because of this, there's tons of fun and new experiences to be had. Each day I feel I get a little bit better, I know the maps more, I know what to counter tricky opponents like dead ringers and huntsmans, or I get my ♥♥♥ handed to me by people who've put thousands of hours into the game.  There are 9 classes, each of them unique in their playstyle and the weapons they can wield. From the slow moving minigun wielding Heavy to the lightning fast scout, there's a playstyle for everyone. Also, Valve has done a fantastic job of balancing the game. Every class and weapon has advantages and disadvantages, but not too much that they can't get around their 'Counters' With a bit of skill and intuition. Each class has a primary, a secondary, and a melee weapon. There's your standard shotguns, flamethrowers and rocket launchers but also some wierd ones like lasers, frying pans... milk?  So who would I not recomend this amazing game to?  People who enjoy story driven games: Believe it or not, TF2 does have a story, but you have to go out of your way to find it (in the comics or other places) and I feel it serves more to explain and give a reason for how crazy things got ingame than to be an actual story.  People who play games for the atmosphere: TF2 has some excellent music and scenery, that's for sure. Muted colours with industrial complexes resembling factories and barns of the 1950's and fitting perfectly with the sombre but hopeful music driven by the military beat of snare drums makes for a great atmosphere... Until a soldier falls out of the sky and hits you on the head with a shovel who is then killed instantly by a spy who decloaks and pops out of nowhere, only to get covered in ♥♥♥♥ and shot to death by an obscene sniper who gets obliterated by a demoman who gets shot by a guy who gets trickstabbed by another who gets burned to death by another who walks into a sentry nest and gets shot to death... Basically, the game can be atmospheric, but you won't have any time to enjoy it.  People who expect to hop in and do well instantly: This game has a lot of fancy physics, mecahnics, playstyles, and weapons to learn, on top of the need for general skills like good reflexes and accuracy. Put simply, you will probably be getting a lot more deaths than kills at first. As long as you are willing to learn and keep playing, within a couple of sessions you should be reasonably skilled.  Hackers: The community is extremely good at finding and rooting out hackers. I've seen people call the whistle on their aimbotting teammates even if said hacker was winning the game. Often people will go into spectator mode if they see something fishy and call a vote to kick the player. Regardless, the more hardcore TF2 players seem willing to do anything to keep the game hacker free (maybe because of good intentions, maybe because they don't want competition :P).  And finally, Lone Wolves/Nodeath-ers: This is a team game. So much so that it's in the name. Being a team player is essential to getting the most out of TF2, as well as the key to winning most of your games. Whether it's repairing other engie's dispensers, warning your teammates of where the spies are, or simply not taking the healthpacks if someone else needs it more, you are helping your team win far more than just hiding in a corner of the map with a stickybomb trap or phlogistinator. And don't get me wrong, while kills are important, it's necessary to balance out the kills with the main objectives. And while you should try not to get killed, there's no need to go overboard. Chances are that if you're new to the game, you won't know where the healthpacks are. If there aren't any near you, it's often just quicker to see if you can take someone down with you and respawn rather than backtracking all the way to your base and healing.  In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic game that I am proud to call myself a player of.",

A friend I met through ROTMG and I started playing TF2 and we had a bunch of laughs.  Before TF2, the most tongue-in-cheek FPS game I'd ever played was Duke Nukem3D. (Yeah, I played DNF, but I had to stop. Being a female, I couldn't take the egregiously overwhelming misogyny -- which says a lot, because I absolutely LOVE DN3D to this day.) Yes, Half-Life has humor, as do Unreal and Unreal Tournament, but the games' stories in and of themselves still take themselves seriously and take you to another place entirely.  Once I started playing TF2, I became obsessed with it. I haven't experienced this level of obsession with 'something' since I discovered the LEGO Bionicle sets back in 2001. Now, if you've read my review for ROTMG, you'll know I have OCD. It's not difficult for me to get obssessed about PC games; they're in my blood. But not every PC game I play compels me to research the heck out of the game's mythos, or read the wiki like I was reading a good book.  SPOILER! SCROLL DOWN UNTIL YOU SEE THE END SPOILER TAG IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!                    I'm VERy interested to know why the Heavy will not return to The Team.                       OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD NOW, THE SPOILER'S GONE!  This is a gloriously violent and bloody game. You will see gibs, you will hear agonized cries of death all around you. But you will also hear people roar with laughter at how they just capped the final point in a round being just a Medic ubering a Heavy. You will laugh yourself when you see your fellow Demoman detonate the mass of Stickybombs s/he just launched around the Payload and watch the gibs fly (yes. I have experienced these myself -- and laughed hilariously). Unlike similar games, TF2 shamelessly acknowledges its violent tendencies and invites you to partake in them. So grab your Minigun and fall in with the Soldier, Scout, Spy, Sniper, Medic, Pyro, Demoman, and Engineer, and get ready to kill some people!",

            "review_text": "team fortress 2 is a fantastic game the diversity between each class is astounding each class has unique dynamics which really set them apart from each other the fact that you can customize your character means that almost no two users will look the same one scout might be wearing nothing but a coat and the other scout might be wearing a ninja hood shirt and socks and each weapon has its own pros and cons well most of them and unlocking weapons is much different then other games like cod battleffield etc instead of having to level up to get items you can A. get them of the mann.co store or community market B. find them randomly the only thing about this though is you only have monday through thursday to do so also you only have 10hours extra playtime will not be rewarded whith drops and C. you can craft them. Another great thing is you dont have to level up at all and there nine classes each has a different role on the battlefield another thing is that the community is fantastic and extremely helpful for not so nice player there are 10 helpful ones in fact if you are having trouble you can look at some helpful guides that explain each class and how it works there is also a ton of community created content there are workshop items custom modes maps and so much more also you dont need to much of an expensive pc to run this at a decent fps. Also you can trade items. Did i forget to mention that this game is free also there is much teamwork in this game and there are so many taunts aswell you can interact with other players. So i would definately recommend this amazing fps title.",

I personally am not a cosmetic person unless they actually help me in some way, but there are many, many, many hats, bells, whistles, and other hats. i have been playing quite a bit, and got two friends wanting to play it too. probably the best part is that the people who play it are so diverse. you can have one server with a ton of jerks, and another with the nicest people in the world, and another with people who just want to have fun.   I won't deny, i do (sometimes) rage. the game can be hard, a walk in the park, an equal challenge, and everything in between!   But if you are looking at playing it, I mainly have 2 things to say/write: why haven't you gotten it already (it has been out for seven years((I think))and it is FREE) and also, just know you will not be playing cod or anything close to it.   and for the aspiring child who is looking to get their parents on board, just a few minor warnnings: first, there is blood, however that can be turned off, just look for a 'sillygibs' tutorial. second, there are mean people out there. I think that can be fixed too by turning off the ingame chat in options. third, there is a little cussing, no f-bomb, or poop-replacement (unless someone says it in the chat) but things like 'damn' and 'moron', etc. do occur in the scripting for the characters. maybe the worst is '♥♥♥♥♥♥,' kind of a staple of the sniper to say that. there may be a fix for that too that i don't know about. finally, if you are really young, you may be labeled as a 'squeaker.' it's a bullying term making fun of the fairly high pitched voice of a child.  my final thing to say is this: it is my favorite game, and I have not met a fps gamer who tried tf2 and did not like it.

Anyways, let's start with an initial presentation of the GAMEPLAY:  Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter developed by Valve that uses team-based cooperation heavily in its gameplay, providing 9 different classes that all play a distinct role. The Scout is a lightweight class that is used for flanking and, as such, is most beneficial to be directed through secondary paths, such as to surprise the enemy. The Soldier is an 'average' class that doesn't have many downsides. The versatility it provides makes it a 'swiss maggot knife'. The Pyro is usually devised as a harrassing class, dealing damage with afterburn to weaken the enemies. There's a character limit to the review, so I'll speed it up. The Demoman uses traps to prevent the enemy team from advancing. The Heavy is a sort of 'walking sentry' that acts as a wall between the enemy and the objective, being able to deal tremendous amounts of damage. Well, ♥♥♥♥.

Meet your Match is an update that divided the community, harmed the growth of the game, showed how little valve truely cares, and most importantly, what happens when the players of the game are ignored.  Team Fortress 2 in my opinion has been a journey with highs and lows over the last few years. I loved 2011 and 2012, 2013 was a very nice update haven for mann vs machine and tf2 halloween fans like myself, 2014 felt awful compared to the previous years with the exception of love and war, but then came 2015 and 2016... holy @&amp;$%.  These last two years have been terrible for TF2, in the process of modernising the game it failed to stay true to what it was. Gun mettle was fine but everything else felt more like valve never played the game before. Update after update it slowly made less and less sense. Demoknights getting nerfed to high hell, phlog getting buffed to high hell.  But then Meet your match came out, removing quickplay, having a terrible competitive and casual mode, weapon changes that made no sense, locked viewmodel fovs, and everyones favorite matchmaking times and server issues.  The war that was once pyro and heavy was now defend valve or rip valve a new one.  Rumor after rumor, argument after argument, it has caused the tf2 community to become cynical it is both funny and sad that valve let it become... well this.  Maybe one day valve will listen to us, but that is less likely than half life 3.",

Of course you can pay, I have, usually for the special little features, but it never feels necessary; it's the skill of you more than you weapon that can show how good you are. But if your going to pay for anything, I'd recommend something related to an update's campaign. That will keep you occupied for a few months for just a few bucks.

        {
            "review_text": "I used to love this game, but it has slowly gotten worse and worse, and now, this game can't even be taken seriously anymore. Even after over 1000 hours in this game, I am still dissapointed. I will list a COUPLE OF REASONS for you below:  1. The updates Every update which adds new weapons makes the game more unbalanced. It didn't used to be so bad when the weapons rewarded skill. The ambassador rewarded players who could aim by doing more damage on headshots. The kritzkreig made the ubercharge more versatile but gave up the invincibility and made the medic vulnerable while the charge happening. But then Valve started making weapons like the backburner, which has a very small drawback but still gives you crits from behind. The manmelter doesn't use ammo, can't be deflected and the projectile travels 50% faster. It can extinguish friendlies and you get crits for doing so. Then there's stuff like the frontier justice that gives you free crits because somebody destroyed your minisenrty. How the heck does that make sense? I liked TF2 back when the classes were balanced and when Valve didn't cater to the newbs who can't aim, communicate or use strategy. The sniper and scout aren't meant to be specifically anti-spy classes, yet for some reason the scout has mad milk which makes the cloak useless, and the sniper has jarate which too makes the cloak useless, and then gives the sniper free crits if he's using the bushwacka. How does that reflect what the sniper is meant to be: Powerful at long range, but fairly useless in melee combat at close range and vulnerable to spies. There's the axetinguisher which gives the pyro the ability to pretty much instakill most classes from close up. The Pomson 6000 doesn't use ammo, drains cloak and UBERCHARGE, and still does damage. How is that in any way balanced? All the engineer needs to do is spam around his buildings and spies can't even get close, even when using the invisibility watch. Then you have weapons like the third degree which are pretty much just a straight upgrade to the stock. Why do you think no pyros use the stock fire axe? That's right, because all the unlocks are FAR better. In my opinion any weapon which is added to the game shouldn't impact on the vanilla set, so that the vanilla set remains the best set to use; the unlockables are meant to be 'side-grades' not buffs or game changing weapons.  2. Hats I don't get it. People actually pay as much as $1500 in real money for unusual hats in TF2. It's a game for christ's sake, in a few years no-one will even play it and your fancy expensive hat will be worthless and unseen. What's worse is so much of the community thinks that hats are an important part of TF2. It's an online fps, not The Sims, how you look is completely irrelevant. Here's an idea, if you want to look nice then do it in real life where you actually get to keep the hat forever. What's worse is Valve seems to be as oblivious to this as the community. Rather than fix bugs or improve the hit detection, they focus on hats. I think that is a skewed and unprofessional philosophy.    3. Broken replays Every update causes whatever replays you have to become completely useless. And sometimes they just don't work. A few days ago I made some great replays, but when I tried to render then, all I got were error codes. Upon further research I discovered that the error codes meant the replays were useless and unrecoverable. Also unless I'm mistaken and it's been fixed since I last checked, Valve still hasn't addressed the problem of the smoke covering the screen for replays as spy.  4. Terrible players Here's my theory. When a game is first released all the hardcore fans get it. For a while the servers are full of mostly good players. Then over time the game becomes more mainstream and popular and more people get it. This causes the quality of the players in servers to be diluted. Eventually the good players start to get tired of the bad players and begin to leave. This results in an increase in the number of good players leaving causing a snowball effect resulting in mostly bad players remaining. But i really just blame this on valve for not putting enough information about the game out there.  5. Bugs and hit detection As previously mentioned, the hit detection in TF2 sucks. There are so many times when I get killed by players who manage to shoot me through walls, around corners and when I'm behind cover. Perhaps it's the antiquated source engine or maybe it's just the mess that is TF2 Regardless I hate it and it should have been addressed YEARS ago. .There's weapons like the huntsman (should i say 'cuntsman') that have such a large hitbox, letting you headhsot the enemy even when you DIDNT HEADHSOT THEM. A bug I experienced today was one I've not experienced before. I stepped of the edge of some steps in koth_harverst (the ones leading to the windows); It's a 1m drop and I was on full health, but for some reason I died instantly. I've done it hundreds without taking damage and it takes a fall of considerable height to actually die on full health in TF2. But for some reason I died instantly. Other bugs include Razorbacks that you can't see until you stab (something which will kill even the best spies), some weapons not spawning (it's a lot of fun when you try to pull out your melee weapon only to discover it didn't spawn and now you're dead), and clipping in walls.  7. Random crits Seriously, who in God's name came up with this idea? I don't even know why Valve thought it would be a good idea to put them in the game. Random crits do nothing but destabilise gameplay. There have been so many times when I should have won a battle but then I didn't because my opponent got a random crit and killed me. Then there's those weapons which seem to crit literally EVERY TIME (ubersaw, frying pan, wrench, powerjack). Pyro already has about a million ways to get guranteed crits, why they hell does he need random crits too?  Who else is feeling the same way? I'm well aware this is going to get trolled but I don't really care I just wanted to put the thoughts that have been going through my head for months into words.",

For those that don't know what TF2 is, it's a fast-paced, first person shooting game that's based on 9 classes. They are divided into 3 sections: Offensive, Defensive, and Support. Neither of these sections really effect the gameplay, but if you're new, its good to know what classes do what. Offensive classes are the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. Defensive classes are the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. Support classes are Medic, Sniper, and Spy. Now this isn't like every other FPS game thats full of realisticness, blood, and guts. This game has cartoon-like graphics, but still looks pretty real. The gameplay isn't super realistic either, I mean; just look at how the Scout double jumps. I reccomend this game to anyone. It's Free to Play, but you only get 50 slots of backpack space, and you can't give items, but you can get items from other players. If you buy something from the Mann Co. Store, then you will gain 250 backpack slots (300 in total, can get more with backpack expanders), and you can trade with people. The community of this game is full of nice and responsible people. You can't play this game with a good team, but you normally get very good teams. This game can be very competitive, but in a fun way. So what are you waiting for? Go try Team Fortress 2 out right now!",

Well, not really reviews and more like 2 sentences saying 'volvo u kiled this game r.i.p quickplay i unistall'. So, I felt that I should right a review that isn't just a ton of hate, but rather actual honest thoughts. With all that out of the way, let's start!   Team Fortress 2, as you probably already know, is a team-based first person shooter created by Valve. It involves 2 teams, RED and BLU, and centers around each team trying to complete certain objectives to win. For example, BLU might be pushing a bomb towards RED's main base to destroy it. Most of these objectives are fun to play, with a few one-offs that aren't as exciting here or there (I'm looking at you, tc_hydro). 9 different classes can be chosen to complete these objectives, and depending on what classes make up a team, it can make or break the game for them. The game provides a training mode on the menu to get used to some of these classes, chosen by clicking on 'Play Game' and then picking 'Training' from the drop-down menu. It is very important that you know the basics of every class, or else your team will be cursing at you until the end of the round.    TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS",

            "review_text": "This game is a must have for 12 year olds with low self esteem. Seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now. I have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the “community.” It is sad. It is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance, unprovoked to people they do not even know.  For instance:   A kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match. “Hey liked how I wrecked you last round?” (No reply from my friend) “Oh what you got nothing to say? Must be too poor to buy a mic.” (So poor yet he owns a computer right?) (I then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance) Random other guy who must have been this child’s friend starts. “What the f#$% you trying to do?” (My vote to kick the initial child fails) (They try and kick me) Shouts “Kick this f@#$^% out of here he's trying to send me pictures of his d$%^” (I get kicked).  Now I don't care about being kicked out of a game. There are many other lobbies I can join to play and try to have “fun” on. What I care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game. Yeah I get it, it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many “trolls” and immature children out there. The problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on. The problem is when I, like many others, sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant, abusive, conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing. Literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults. There is absolutely no need for it. There is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game. It ruins everything video games are meant to be about.  Besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues. The game is goofy with it's cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously. If you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it. Trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players, you will lose money, you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did. I realized this after seeing how much I spent on the game, the situation I explained above and when I started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time (which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying).  Looking at the lucrative “micro transaction” style system involved, it is at least how I see it addicting. Who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them? Constantly buying more keys, to open more crates, in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a “profit” (it hardly ever happens). It is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward. You may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you? Can you sell it and make a profit? Yes. Can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike, or a baseball bat, or pay the rent and bills? Nope. Every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into Steam. So you don't really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment. It gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is it's only purpose. Spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing. I let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than I should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end. I regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that I have lost my enjoyment of the game.  Overall I had fun. 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it. What I realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with. I started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server I was on and that killed my enjoyment. Listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring. I guess maybe I am just at an age where I have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment. Will I miss playing tf2? Probably not now that I have expanded my game library. Will I play it again? Likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun. I will never invest my time, like I used to, back into this game because it is really not worth it. I would recommend if you want to have some fun (100-500 hours) try Team Fortress 2 out, BUT my warning and the point of my review, DO NOT invest a significant amount of time and/or money into this game. It is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community. Everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game.",

Being able to customize your loadout and collect hats, miscs, taunts, etc. the possibilities are endless. The community is also a competitive group of people, all around the world going for the top of the scoreboard, or the community that strives to get that one certain hat, and have the richest backpack. Now, a few downsides would be some of the exploitable bugs, but that's not too big of a deal. Valve is very good with fixing the bugs found nowadays. The annoying downtimes from item servers can be an annoyance as well, but aside from those few things it is overshadowed by Team Fortress 2's greatness.

I rate this game... TEN OUT OF 5 STARS!!  The first part is slightly outdated. Don't get me wrong, I still like Team Fortress 2 a lot. Just not as much.  The reason I liked it so much is because it had a different... Feel, than any other valve game.  Not like Counter Strike, Not like Half-life, I can't really compare it to portal because that's in it's own little world. Anyways, through the updates that brought people so much happiness, A piece to a puzzle was being layed down. The 'Meat Your Match' update finished the puzzle. Stat Traks, Skins, Casual, Competitive; Suddenly, Team Fortress 2 became... Just like the others.  It's slowly turning into CS:GO  Half-Life 3 confirmed  Portal 666 confirmed       Don't believe me?

The name of the game?  Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel (also known as CFGT)  Take a read of this exclusive interview with Gabe I managed to record (don't worry it's not IGN).  - start of interview -   Me:  Why hello Lord Gaben, I'm here to talk to you about your new game, Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel. Share with me all the special details about the game if you'd be so kind to, from start to finish. I would also like to know how you came up with the idea on the game. I know you've always been disclosed about your games at Valve, but you can trust me, I'm not recording this.    Lord Gabe:  Hello to you too. I'd be very proud to talk about our new game, and our innovative approach to this new game. It came along this one confrence we had. It went like this.  '♥♥♥♥ TF2 IS ♥♥♥♥ING UP' 'I KNOW WHAT DO WE DO' -random guy in corner, turns his chair in slow motion- ' we make tf2... COUNTER STRIKE' -everyone celebrates-  So we've decided to borrow some inspiration from our money cow- I mean popular game Counter Strike, but we kept everything that made the game good (to us) and took the gameplay from our best selling free to play game Team Fortress 2. We've introduced brand new exclusive Stattra- I mean strange weapons that you can unbox from very special cases. These weapons have a kill count attatched to the side of the weapon, something no game has ever done before. We've also decided to give players a unique opportunity to chip in $6 to a pass where they can earn never before seen, rarity of weapons by appearance going in the order of, Factory New, Minimal Wear, Field-Tested, Well-Worn and Battle Scarred. We believe that by adding these features, we'll gain even more players, and hopefully forget about that disaster game Team Fortress 2 and it's economy that we slipped up with by giving people what they wanted. You also get to earn a unique coin that can be displayed in game to show off to everyone you've participated in a very special coin, again another feature that's unique to our game. We really tried our hardest to make a unique first person shooter experience in our new game, Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel. We hope you enjoy the game that hits you this Summer.    Me:  Ah... Urh ok.. Thanks for your time um Gabe? I look forward to when you announce Half Life 3 sometime in the next decade.    Lord Gabe:  Don't worry my friend, that's never going to happen.    Me:  You cruel man. How could you do this!?  - end of interview here -   Unfortunately that's all I could get on Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel (CFGT), and Half Life 3 before Gaben called the illuminati and threw me out. But I hope this is enough for you steam readers.   1 like = 1 prayer for half life 3.",

The simplicity of the game's design has really sparked some interest in me, not to mention tens of thousands of other people's too.   And because of this simplicity, it really gets set apart from other FPS games. Take the Medic for example:  A class with a gun that can bring back teammates from the brink of death and whose Übercharges change the flow of battle in mere seconds. The class itself is very unique and unlike anything seen before.  Another noteworthy class is the Spy: A backstabbing saboteur capable of cloaking away from enemies view and disguising as the opposing team.  The classes were given realistic personalities with a touch of humour. The community's perception of the game is very interesting.  Besides, who wouldn't want fat Russian men with burning hats eating sandwiches in the heat of battle?  As far as I know, no other video game has taken such a huge step away from the usual standards.  A remarkable game both artistically and comedically. It truly is the #1 war-themed hat simulator.",

Introduced back in 2007, Team Fortress 2 paved the way for many more games after it and to this day remains insanely popular, with good reason. This once-$20 title proved you could put massive personality and character into a multiplayer based shooter, combined with classic FPS mechanics that work pretty much flawlessly.  The game is expertly designed around 3 core modes - control point, king of the hill, and payload. More have been added since, including Mann vs. Machine (coop), Medieval Mode, and others. Maps in the game are fairly large and open, allowing for multiple tactics to be taken in approaching the enemy rather than funnelling all players down singular corridors or openings, with some paths being clearly defined and some less so, giving it a very natural feel. Each of the 9 characters acts as its' own class with an array of appropriate weaponry and skills that are swappable using item drops you obtain through playing the game, though no item is over or underpowered, meaning the system remains balanced even for those who use entirely stock loadouts or haven't found other weapons or items yet. Despite being free and having a store to buy things from, this is far from a pay to win game, and likely never will be. You'll never feel like you're incapable of contributing the appropriate amount to your team simply due to a lack of loadout items.  The game is also heavily community focused, with massive modding support built in. This means HUNDREDS of player made game modes and THOUSANDS of maps. On top of that, the large majority of all items in the game that are usable as cosmetics and sometimes as weapons were entirely designed by the community, meaning if you DO so choose to buy them, the creators of those items get a share of the money. Even some game modes like Medieval Mode were initially community created modes made official. You are in no way restricted to what the developers created for this game, and in fact I personally have more fun going out and finding these massively modded servers, maps, and modes. There's also a competitive system in the game now, which puts the game more in line with some of its' competitors that, keep in mind, this game directly inspired the creation of, such as Overwatch. I, however, have never used the competitive system and likely won't, but it's a fantastic addition for those who want to play with a sense of stakes and locked-down, smaller teams of 6 that are truly trying to win rather than simply there to play around.  I can't not recommend this game. It's a classic-styled class-based FPS with massive personality and a far more massive list of features and things to do. There's a reason everyone's heard of Team Fortress 2. If you haven't, just go hit that play button. You'll see.",

I say that because Team Fortress 2 is genuinely one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a video game, multiplayer or otherwise. I'm utterly terrible at most video games, and that's no exception here, but the fun I've had with TF2 in those sparse instances where I'm okay at it makes me forget all of that, and just have fun with it. At its core, the game has a charm to me that's never even come close to dying out.  A lot of people say this game jumped the shark when they added weapon skins, or when they added Casual Mode and Competitive Mode. And while I agree that matchmaking in general could be vastly improved, and has been a source of my anger for a few months now, I still love the game at its core, for MVM (which is my mainstay) and a little bit of PVP every now and again. I genuinely don't think it's just buyer's remorse -- there IS fun to be had with TF2 even to this day, and I really am having fun with it.  I've met so many good friends and have so many accomplishments thanks to Team Fortress 2 that this one game has practically changed my entire life. And I'll love every minute of its past, present and future until the time the servers shut down; at which point, I will frame my collection as several large pictures, on each wall of my house, as a memento of time well spent.",

Really, I can say it's one of the best, if not the best, free-to-play game out there, and that's not doing the game much justice. The game has multiple objective-based modes inplemented into a truckload of maps that have been either made by Valve or the community, and contains a pretty deep metagame thanks to the amount of weapons placed in the game and the varying ways that people play each class. Each match may play differently from the last, considering that everyone's going to play differently, which requires you and your team to adapt to survive.  Oh, I mentioned it has hats, didn't I? Yeah, think of this as Valve's way of earning money, along with some of the community members who contribute to the game. i really like this system, as you can customize each class however you want to, and it's a way to give back to the community.

I purchased this game a few years ago, unfortunately a very short time before it went free-to-play, but I do not remotely regret having paid for such an entertaining game.  Aside from some revised classic FPS game modes, the modding/hosting communities present about the game offer a large range of alternative modes (Survival, Versus Saxton Hale and WarioWare to name a few) that bring an expansive, ever-growing catalogue of play styles to your game.  The commercial aspect of the game is primarily aesthetic (you've probably heard the hat jokes), and is in no way necessary to augment your ground against other players. There are numerous weapons with traits that will allow you to customize the way you play your classes, but even the base weapons can achieve great things when weilded by an experienced player.  There are also back-stories via comics, cinematic videos and seasonal events for people who are into that sort of thing.  Overall, a fantastic game. I can only advise you use the official servers primarily for practice and explore others as you progress, since the quality of people you tend to find (F2P etc.) can become daunting.  ",

No unlock is objectively better than what you start out with, but promote different playstyles.  A Dear Ringer spy doesn't have to be as careful as a Cloak and Dagger spy.

I hopped aboard when it went f2p and slowly but steadily fell in love with it. A class-based shooter that encourages teamwork and includes many quirks and fun things you just don't see elsewhere.  I decided to finally write a review of TF2 since many things have changed recently. With the release of Overwatch, we've seen a decline in player numbers with some people even completely jumping ship and cutting all ties with TF2. I mean... I plan to get Overwatch myself but overreacting like that is just nonsense. So Valve decided to do something drastic and add a competitive mode as well as removing pubs completely, replacing them with casual matchmaking. The shock was real for me. I had taken a hiatus from the game and came back to a different world.  Now, there are some issues in both competitive and casual matchmaking. It seems Valve really just rushed them in. Full panic mode. The wait times were very long first, but that seems to be mostly solved. But gone are the times when you just hopped into a Valve server, played a few maps with the same people, making new friends and having a good, relaxed time. I really do hope that we get an option to extend casual matches to avoid constant queuing. Other than that, I have no major complaints about casual.   I've also tried competitive a bit and the ranking system is a complete trainwreck. No placement matches so a total noob can be matched with a veteran of 5000 hours in their first competitive games. That doesn't make any bloody sense. Also, matches are rendered null and void if anyone leaves. This is incredibly frustrating. I have so far only recorded losses because I've been unlucky enough to have someone on the opposing team quit when my team is winning. This is a serious problem for me. It takes out a lot of fun and satisfaction to see my efforts turned into dust just because someone decided to ragequit. Either make the punishments much more severe or give the winners the rank improvements and statistics of a match won, even if someone leaves. Just don't punish the losing team if someone there decides to drop out.  Basically, TF2 is still a great game despite some balancing issues and the problems of matchmaking systems. Don't give up on this grand old lady. Valve seems to be listening to TF2 players more, with all the complaints coming in and players leaving. They just have to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix the problems that are giving players headaches right now.",

Most of the characters are easy to play, but hard to master, so it wont be too difficult to switch characters and play as that one. I reccomend this game to anyone 10 and up. You can turn of the blood, and as long as a kid understands that it's not ok to do any of this in real life, and to keep a positive attitude, he/she should be find. See you in Pyroland!",

            "review_text": "Overall, 9/10.  TL:DR Enjoyable game, fun economy and generally nice players.  Let's get started; The playerbase mainly consists of younger Gamers, but also includes a variety of people. You have the pure Trader with all their play-time on trade-servers, the F2P that has no idea how to trade and mainly plays for fun, the mixed player, who trades and plays for fun and the annoying trolls that attempt to ♥♥♥♥ up every single second of your gameplay.   The Squeakers; Yes, this is an issue. A squeaker is a younger player of the gaming community, that has a higher-pitched or an annoying voice that many players find highly irritating. Squeakers are not only found in TF2, but in the majority of online-gaming. There is an in-built mute system in Team Fortress 2 that some-what eliminates the Squeakers.   The 'Rich Kids'; Usually the 'Rich Kids' are found on Spycrabbing servers, Unusual Trade-Servers and gambling servers in general, they thrive by showing off their riches that they won purely from luck or purchased with real-world currency. Do not communicate with these players, they will toss you aside like trash on a side-walk.   The Pure Traders; These players love to trade. They spend all of their play-time on trading servers and websites. They don't care about the TF2 gameplay, they purely care about how much their Backpack is worth and how fast they can trade up to an unusual from a scrap.. These players are nicer than the 'Rich Kids' but still annoying. They hate F2P Members with a passion and take up any opportunity to ♥♥♥♥-talk them.   The F2P Players; They are the most innocent of the playerbase, they are usually new players that have just downloaded the game and want to hop into a match, only to get ♥♥♥♥-talked by every paid player they talk to. They take time to become a paid player, not realizing you have to spend real money to upgrade, or pain-stakenly trade up to a Premium Upgrade. If you see a F2P player, give them a weapon. It'll mean the world to them.  The Trolls; The amount of trolls on Team Fortress 2 is immense, they are everywhere, no-matter where you go. They enjoy ♥♥♥♥ing with F2P Players and Premium Players alike. They are annoying, under 11 and they usually have a foul-mouth. I am not going to go in detail on what trolls do to troll you, but feel free to search around on YouTube.  ~This Review is W.I.P~",

Additionally, upon starting the game you will not be instantly swamped by players who can kill you easier because they have weapons that are better than you. Everything in tf2 is balanced beautifully, between the weapons, individual classes and the overall team dynamic. Each new item doesn't bring with it a new advantage, but a new way that you can tweak your playstyle, with it's own individual positive and negative aspects.  The overall feel of the game is great as well, due to the cartoony graphics and humorous quips that your team will constantly spout. Even in the worst matches, when I've had my head driven into the dirt by a more skilled team, I still walk away with an inward grin at that one time that four of my team mates and I walked a literal conga line through the enemy team's defence or airblasting an enemy scout and keeping him pinned against a wall while he shouted that I was a spy, followed by us sharing a high five and his character spontaneously exploding.

No mp line  When considering all the quality factors, I would give this game a 7.5/10. However, considering it only cost $10.. It's a great game.

All the weapons that are acquirable in the shop can be dropped and/or crafted in this game, the only paid related thing to it would be Hats and Inventory space, but to be honest, most of my time spent in this game was spent as a F2P player, and i don't regret a single moment spent in this game.

While they aren't adding many nowadays, the weapons we have now (as well as the stock weapon skins if you want to consider them weapons) are very well thought out and each provides it's own unique playstyle. It's market thrives off of cosmetics and hats, to the point where community members may call it a hat simulator with guns, but that makes it even more fun! Just like the weapons, cosmetics can be equipped and can be mixed and matched to make unique combinations. It has withstanded the test of time and is still one of the most popular games on the steam engine.

Nerfs nobody needed, buffs nobody wanted, changes that nobody asked for. A pro player had to talk them out of changing a weapon for a game they (Valve) don't even play any more. A casual mode involving queuing, leaving penalties, lack of choice regarding maps and modes. Said casual mode was only 'fixed' following the game's community lashing out.  TF2's faults are many, but I can ignore them. The thing is that I can't recommend a game when the developers don't care about it. It's clear to me that Valve only keeps TF2 going because it's earning them money. They don't want to put the effort into playing their own game or communicating with its community. I mean, the worst thing about everything that's gone wrong with the game is that it could all have been avoided if Valve didn't ignore the community until everything reached boiling point.

As a long time fan it burdens me to give the game a bad review but with this last update of the match making system I must.  Overall it is about lack of player power.  No vote to kick blatant 360 hackers. No auto-adjust teams. You play the teams a computer wants, not what you want/fix poor synergy. Hassle free joining and leaving of lobbies is now a memory. Loss of community feeling with favorite servers no longer allowing 'ad-hoc' connections. Loss of the care-free attitude that made the game fun and relaxing. Loss of game identity. It was TF2, now it is an attempt to be Overwatch.  It was a good run over the years, I hope you revert these silly changes. bluebaron201 ",

Author said the game has a lot of advantages, 9 distinct glasses, and the main thing... cozy, expensive and cool customization... Later (about a week later) we played on some custom map with my friends and were thinking how this game was cool, how it is well balanced and stuff... But later, we noticed one more thing:the game was always changing. The gameplay was changing, there was added new custom parts... and you know what? i left from this game, because i didn't like all this changes...  In 2012 (or 2011) my friend sucked me back in the game with the arguement of 'dude, you have to check it out'. And the thing was men vs. machine update. I was more than amazed... so much changed for all this 4 years while in most other games stuff stays the same!   I highly recommend this game to everybody: from the ones who likes bloody shooters, to the people who likes fat eastern eggs on stuff from media. And especially changes, because this game lives more than 8 years now, and it keeps changing, it keeps being popular, it keeps being fresh.",

I would write a review about how the update has changed the game but like I said, I am still waiting to join one...  Edit: I have finally joined a game!!! And it sucks. They (valve) has changed a few of the skins for a few weapons that i like and the new 'skins' literally almost make me feel sick. the reloading on some has you hand just clip all the way through the weapon. Also the maps and the way they changed the hud is painful. If there is a petition to change it all back please tell me whereas this update has made me lose faith in valve.  As the saying goes.

While this is somewhat close to being almost true, Valve is quickly fixing it, thanks to the community's feedback. As such, I wouldn't consider it a long-term factor when you're thinking about playing this or not.  Besides, just look at how many hours some people have on this game. Not 50, not 250, not 500, not even 999.........but THOUSANDS. Yes, plural. That shows just how much people love this game, before the update. Although, like I said, the negative affects of the update won't be around for long.  However, if you truly do have unbearably long wait times, just go online and find some non-official servers. My personal reccomendations are:   Skial , if you want something very similar to official servers  Harpoon Gaming , if you are just getting started with trading  Intox Gaming , if you want a good ol' time with custom maps and mods  Neonhight's Servers , if you want a fun experience with mods and maps, with a bit of trading mixed in  ACG  (Uber Upgrades, specifically), if you want to have way over-the-top OP battles.  Plus, there's the  amazing  community. We have popular YouTube channels, memes, and thousands (or, dare I say, millions) of players every day. In fact, we've got an entire fandom....sort of.     Tl;dr:     Play this game. If you don't like it in its current state, play Dirty Bomb or some other free substitute.",

The hat phenomenon was at first a lol thing , that we first accepted ; that in-game market , that however , was no good .  And then there was the nuke . The Meet the Medic update , introducing the free to play . What was the reward to old players for buying the game ? A hat . It looks like a WW2 british hat , but for me , it evokes more like Valve's middle finger, pointed to my face . The community ... TF2 used to have one of the greatest and most friendly community I had ever seen in any FPS . Such perfection was anihilated in one day . Now , the autistic F2Ps who wouldn't even hit an AFK are everywhere . Is there a sentry blocking your way on your attack ? You'll have to destroy it yourself , because your allies will keep running on it and dying like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turds they are . Managing to bring down some of the ennemies ? Too bad , five others will come on you alone . Some ennemy made it through your defense ? Then you're ♥♥♥♥ed . If you defend , you'll be there forever , as your team will never know how to capture an objective . If you attack , it's like an instant defeat , because your team doesn't defend . Nor attack .   The fact I'm referencing here is the team system . In every ♥♥♥♥ing server , it will be like this : one teams contains all the good players , one other contains the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . If the team happen to be balanced , the goods will gather will the goods because it's TF2 and people won't like challenge . If you happen to be in the good team , the game will say ♥♥♥♥ you and 'team balance' : putting you alone in the team full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ , leaving you 1v10 .  Let's not forget the cancer of Demoknight , which make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unable to destroy sentries anymore , and the minisentry , the invention of satan himself .  That's only a few cons of the modern TF2 . The rest is up to yourself to see or to read by the other games review , as I assumed you've read a lot , but the most annoying thing is listed there .  It's not a game anymore . It's valve's personal milkstation , filled with the second most toxic community of videogames .  ♥♥♥♥ you valve , for you ♥♥♥♥ed us way too hard .",

Constantly updated with new game modes, maps, equipment and, most importantly, hats!' As it says in the games own description the most important thing is Hats!  Team fortress 2 is a first person FPS with a vast item base and many community created maps and modding equipment which will allow the player to full change everything about the game be it the in-game Heads up Display (HUD), Weapon skins, Hats, Players etc... with ease, Since Team Fortress's realse it has gone through massive changes, The overall balance of classes is perfect some of them are better against overs but they are never overpowered even when the game adds new weapons and changes it never becomes inbalanced.  This game also has the biggest trading community in existence, I thought it was massive inside games such as 'World of Warcraft' and 'Dota 2' Team fortress's tradig is by far the most indepth and interesting community, The trading system is easy to get used to thanks to the many 3rd party websites which update prices on a regular basis.  The best thing about Team fortress 2 however is its gameplay, The maps appear to be endless thanks to the tons of community made maps and already official Valve created maps, Valve has also taken this into granted by giving this game the biggest workshop community allowing players to create amazing maps, hats, misc and new weapons to be added to the game in either little patchs at times or biig community updates or festivals inside the game so the game is always feeling alive.  Only con I could think of is some of the fanbase can be rather harsh to new players, I have played the Xbox version starting off and moving to the pc version and now racking up almost 1,000 hours on other accounts starting off can be rough on some servers.  Overall the game is worth playing, If you are not into the genre you should at least test it out and try it for yourself.",

With added 'hats' and 'different' weapons or 'different' takes on already existing weapons.   Gameplay is great and each of the 9 classes are completely unique with their own skills and weapons to master, Spy being the hardest and Heavy being the easiest (in my opinion), even though some may find the game repetitive and a '1 night fling' sort of game, it is still worth playing as it is a free to play.  The 'Online Policies' are not too bad but some items can cost and outrageous amount of money, but all can be avoided by buying items from tf2shop and trading with the online community at backpack.tf and etc.   But this game being 'Profitable' is not its only strong point, mastering and or becoming experienced at this game creates a much better play style and enjoyable game. Being competitive like most FPS (not COD -_-) learning the each classes strong point and weakness is fun and knowing which class can detect or kill another class easily is fun and interesting, for example if an engineer is not guarding his buildings they can be wiped out in seconds by Snipers or a by the Spy's sapper, if you consist as a team of all Heavies without 'Pocket Medics' you are not going to get very far if the neighbourhood Spy or Sniper comes along and says 'Hi!'.  Pyros mostly end up as Spy detectors if you are not an experienced player and help protect the Engineer and his ammo consuming buildings, and of course the Medic being one of the most quintessential points to a team’s success, if paired up with a Demoman or a Soldier and of course a Heavy.  Each class has three main ways to attack its 'prey', a primary weapon (the Heavy's minigun, Pyro's flamethrower, Engineer's sentry gun, etc.) and secondary (various classes have shotguns, others pistols, while the Demoman has a highly effective mine thrower) and melee weapons (the Scout's bat, the Medic's ‘bone saw’, and so on). Teamwork is also another vital part when it comes to winning against the 'enemy team'. As I find TF2 a great team builder along with 'Counter Strike'  Overall the game is a must play and especially coming from someone like me who has over 900 hours with the game: D  Opiziite - 9.6",

The class diversity, the community (other than that of the MvM community), taunts, weapons, and most importantly.... Hats.  So, while most people think the community is toxic, they must've been in the wrong damned place, because everywhere I have been everyone has been very polite and nice.  With one exception, the MvM Tour of Duty community. People there are so damned strict with what they want, as they push through one of the most challenging tasks of getting an Australium weapon. Many of them have ego's larger than the ♥♥♥♥♥ on a black male, but, some aren't as religiously following this gamemode, and they will mess around if they realize being serious isn't beating the wave.  So, other than that, our community is running fine. Team Fortress has fought changing times, and has succeeded.   It's the game that you hate to love, but the game you can't put away.  10/10 would play another 1,000 hours and probably will.",

I believe the amount of time Steam states is wrong seeing how I played this game for a month. This was before the hats and crates.  You might hear people call this game 'Hat Fortress' and say that it's all about hats. In reality, they're just collectables used as a form a customization, not affecting the gameplay.  As for the gameplay, TF2 is a balanced FPS with many game modes to play such as: CTF, Control Point, a horde mode, King of the Hill to be played on a variety of maps. There are also several unoffical game modes with custom maps. And with the 9 different speciliazed classes to choose from, It's not long before you find what's suits you perfectly.  The game isn't your usual Free-to-Play game. most of those games are riddled with miicrotransactions that are made to capitalize on those who are impatient. TF2 has a unique drop system to help those who are new and with only one payment you own the game! With the trade system, you won't have to worry about not finding a gun or maybe even a hat you'd want.",

            "review_text": "(This review is a rewrite of my old one, which was far less serious)  Team Fortress 2, even after over 8 years since its release, remains one of Steam's most played games. TF2 has exciting FPS gameplay, 9 classes that all feel different from one another, and it feels incredibly smooth to control your character and shoot people. Each class has unlockable weapons, which are (mostly) side-grades to the stock. The game has several bright, well-designed, and interesting maps to play on. This game still hasn't gotten old for me, because there's so much stuff to learn and do. Even after getting the hang of all the classes, you can still learn about things like sentry jumps, trimping, and entering the reference pose to screw with people. This is because so many people have played the game and discovered new mechanics over the years.  Team Fortress 2 also has an amazing free-to-play model. Every single map, weapon, class, and mechanic is available to everybody for free. All things you are required to invest money in are completely cosmetic, mostly hats and weapon reskins.  The TF2 community can be rather toxic at times. People often do things like spam memes and bully new players, even if they themselves are relatively new. Nice players are still playing this game though. I run into players who are good sports and display kind manners toward their opponents and new players.  Not everything is completely balanced in TF2, either. Some weapons and weapon combos can be unfair to fight against, but every once in a while Valve steps in and fixes these things. Speaking of which, Valve has been helping the game out a lot recently, with bug fixes, balance changes, a new competetive mode (not perfect but in the making), and cosmetic updates. I have a lot of hope for the future of TF2 and its community, and I invite anyone who wants to play a good shooter game to join us.",

I wasn't a big fan but when I got into the game, it . . . wasn't so bad. Just different from what I expected. I wasn't into TF2 until I hit the community servers. TF2 has an interesting community and if it wasn't the community, I don't think I would have stuck around. I have met many people, some who later became my friends, who taught me a lot about TF2's game mechanics, their classes, and their game modes. From community servers to Valve (then Casual Mode) to competitive, I've enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought.  So what's the verdict? It's a great game but lately Valve hasn't done much 'updating' . . . It's more like they're pushing all their updates towards the community but, you get to see the community's huge creative side and people who makes TF2 a great game again. Valve took too long bringing in their Casual and Competitive modes, but it has made many people re-think how to play each class, each game mode, and each map. It has gone through some bad updates but the game survived (somewhat). Sure Valve is slowly neglecting TF2 for other products, but the community holds strong by bringing in their contents and make it great. With 2000+ hours on this game, I still enjoy it because I get to see some interesting, and sometimes frustrating, things whenever I play. So have fun and meet some great people.",

Each and every one of the 9 classes in TF2 have their own unique personality which gives them a charming feel and makes them seem like actual people instead of faceless soldiers. They all have voice lines that crack me up just because of how stupidly they can be used. In how many games will you see a Soldier with a rocket launcher shooting up the enemy as he continues to THANK them?   There are tons of unlockable weapon combinations and each weapon offers its own special set of stats to keep the experience of killing your target refreshing.   The only problem I have with this game is with most of the community (especially the MvM community). I can't stand the toxic attitude so commonly found within this virtual hat simulator. However, looking past the losers, I have met some truly great people in this game which have further helped my enjoyment of the game.  Overall, this game is a crazy blast of fun, wacky proportions and is absolutely worth installing (for free!) and checking out. It is amazing to think that I can still find fun in a game that I have clocked over 7,000+ hours into. The one-of-a-kind experience I have had with TF2 is what makes it my favorite online video game.",

            "review_text": "I've had the Team Fortress 2 for about a week now, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the product and the quality of the espresso it can make. I upgraded from a simpler Team Fortress and a separate burr grinder, and one of the attractive features of the Team Fortress 2 was the integrated grinder. The other thing that appealed to me was the ability to adjust lots of features.  In the first few days, I experimented a lot with grind fineness (it can grind VERY fine - I'm quite pleased with the grinding function), the amount of grounds, and how hard I tamped the grounds. These three things, along with the amount of water (pre-programmed or manually controlled) can affect the extraction of the espresso. Since I like to obsess over coffee, I was quite happy to spend a few days figuring out just the right balance of these various things. My partner, however, was quite agitated that she couldn't simply make a decent espresso like we had been able to do with our previous Team Fortress. If you're impatient and don't like to experiment, this might not be the Team Fortress for you. However, after a few days I have now made some of the most delicious espresso I've ever drunk, and certainly the most delicious espresso I've ever made at home.  Initially, we had problems with the pressure. The gauge never went past 'pre-infusion' stage, into the ideal espresso extraction range. The espresso came out too runny and had little to no crema. Even at the finest setting, filling the portafilter as much as possible and tamping as hard I could, I couldn't get that gauge to get above the pre-infusion stage. If this happens (or has happened) to you, don't give up, just read on here. I called Valve and got great customer service. I was told to test the pressure so that we'd know if the Team Fortress was defective or if I could adjust things to get the outcome I wanted. They had me use the single-walled, single-cup filter basket, insert the cleaning disk (a rubber disk that comes with the unit), and then fill the portafilter with foil. This would essentially block the basket and allow the pressure to rise. Then I hit the single espresso shot. After 3 or 4 times of this, the pressure went into the gray (espresso extraction) range, so we knew the Team Fortress was okay. But my next few shots of espresso still came out liquidy with hardly any crema.  Here's what I now do to get a delicious cup of caramel colored, sweet, thick espresso with a beautiful crema: I set the grinder to grind espresso that's the consistency of table salt (as Valve recommends), then I manually grind a bit of espresso into the portafilter, tap it on the counter a few times to settle the grounds (do NOT tamp in between - this will create air pockets), grind some more, tap some more, and so on, until the fourth time I finally have enough grounds in the portafilter that I can then tamp. In my experience, this technique compacts the grounds enough to remove the air space, and now the pressure gauge enters the proper region and I'm quite often able to make a fantastic espresso.  If you're not a perfectionist, you can still make a decent espresso with this Team Fortress, but I probably wouldn't bother spending the money. You can get a Team Fortress for $150 and a burr grinder for $100 and still make a good cup. But if you want an excellent cup and you don't want to spend over $1000, then this Team Fortress (and a little experimentation) will do the trick.  The Team Fortress 2 is well engineered, well made, has lots of things you can adjust (grind fineness, grind amount, water amount, water temperature, pre-set or manual shot length), and looks nice besides. I'm quite happy with my purchase. And even though my partner was initially impatient and started questioning whether this was a good purchase, she's now a convert and is quite happy to have delicious espresso at home.",

            "review_text": "You know a game is bad when it is free to play and I still cant recommend playing it. For some reference, I have 963 hours in this game, and I have been playing it since probably around 2012(over 4 years at the time of writing this), and I have seen the game go from pretty good, to decent, to bad, to worse. Before I get started, I would like to give a heads up to the reader that this is a long review. If you don't want to read the whole thing, I'll give you a short list summarizing the problems with the game below.  -long matchmaking queues -you aren't matched with players of equal skill -bad framerate as a result of poor optimization -bad graphics  -lots of little kids -updates are rare nowadays, and are low quality -devs don't care about the game -no audio custimization whatsoever -ingame economy is dead -not many bugs, but the ones that are there are pronounced and do a lot to ruin the game   Now to get on with the review:    This game hasn't been in a good state for years, but up until recently, it was at least a decent game considering it is free. That's not the case anymore. In an update(Called 'Meet your Match'), about a month ago, the developers(Valve) completely ruined the game. Now, instead of being able to join any server you pleased, you are now forced through their broken matchmaking system. Initially, I welcomed the MM(matchmaking) system. I wanted to be able to join games fast and be matched with players of equal skill. Unfortunately, MM lacks any of this, despite it being adveritized as such. Queue times are annoyingly long, taking a few minutes to find a match. This may not sound like a huge deal, but it is, considering the whole point of the update was to be able to automatically find a match fast. Why wait upwards of a minute to find a match when I could have found one in 5 seconds by using the server browser before the update?  I also should mention that the teams are completely unbalanced in MM. 90% of games you either stomp the enemy team because they are noobs or the enemy team stomps you because you were matched with noobs. According to the MM update, you were supposed to be matched with and against players of equal skill, but that isn't the case. There was also a new competitive mode added to the game. Too bad you won't get to play it unless you have a smart phone with Steam Gaurd enabled, or are willing to shell out ten dollars to Valve. Don't worry, you won't be missing out. The competitive mode hasn't changed one bit since beta, and suffers from the same problem regarding being matched with players of equal skill.  There is also a game breaking glitch that has yet to be fixed in which the match is stuck in warmup mode and thus is unable to end.  Needless to say, the last update was a complete failure, and considering that the game's updates have been releasing at even slower rates, and to little avail as far as helping fix the game, it is safe to say that Valve doesn't really care about the game, and is putting in as little effort as possible to keep the game afloat so they continue to sell keys and milk out what little money is left in this game.   So the above paragraphs mention all the things that went wrong with the new update, now I will discuss problems that have been plaguing the game for a long time now. For one, the game is almost a decade old, and the graphics are pretty ♥♥♥♥. Some consider this a plus, given that it allows you to run the game on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer, but since the game isn't optimized correctly after an update that came out about a year ago, you still get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerate no matter how powerful your computer is. The game also lacks basic customization features you would find in any modern game. The video features aren't that bad, but the audio features are terrible. The only customization options for audio is to change the master volume, and to change your mic gain and the voice volume of other players.  Another problem is the game's economy. It is pretty widely accepted that the tf2 economy is dead. This is a game that was known for it's in game economy, and the ability to trade items and make a profit. However, someone had the bright idea of creating a website for voting on the price of items, and it is now the universal standard for trading transactions in tf2. Anyone who has graduated highschool should be able to think of more than a few problems with the concept of voting on prices, but because the game has been plagued by a massive flood of little kids who wouldn't know any better, the website(backpack.tf) is here to stay. Needless to say, the market has almost completely stagnated, and trades are few and far between. The trading issue is even more exemplified by relatively recent changes made by Valve to steam trading as a whole, requiring mobile smartphone in app verification to be able to make trades. If you don't have a smart phone, you will be required to wait half of a month for your trade to actually go through. Fun.  I mention earlier that the game has been flooded by little kids. That is a problem in itself. Given that little kids are stupid and lack any fine motor skills, coordination, or brain power, you might as well be playing with someone who lost their hands. They aren't fun to play against, and they aren't fun to have on your team. The culprits causing their recent influx are most likely popular youtubers that play the game who tend to have young audiences. The kids see it, and because the game is free, they download and play it. This wouldn't even be that big of a deal if Valve was able to actually match people of equal skill together, that way skilled players wouldn't be stuck with little kids. But of course Valve doesn't match people together of equal skill, and because this is a team game requiring actual brainpower, skill, and teamwork, the consequences of being matched with little kids are substantial.   If you read all of that, hopefully you will see why the game just isn't fun to play. I would hope that in the future the game will be fixed up by Valve, but considering it has been years with very little progress, I wouldn't count on it.  P.S. A note about the formatting: For whatever reason, Steam doesn't like it when I tab, and just refuses to recognize those spaces. That's why the formatting looksl ike ♥♥♥♥.",

I say this because most of the changes that happen to this game only come from statistics from in-game senarios (think about all of the trolls running around with sandwiches and spy crabs for one second) and what modern games (COD, BF, CS:GO) implement in their games but when the TF2 devs coded it in. They didnt even properly test the system before forcing it onto the players. Like I said at the begining, the game became 100% broken. 'Meet your Match'? more like 'Wait your Match' with the que system taking up to 5 hours for a 5 minute match of Swiftwater. Competitive mode. Dont even get me started on dat ♥♥♥♥ m8. I was in the Beta for its release since April and it was broken the whole way through. It was as unpolished AF at launch. The Ranking system was broken, XP was broken, and abandons were almost unpunishing.

Sure, they might fix it in the future, but still, the game's only been going down a steep hill ever since the Gun Mettle update came along. TF2 had such original ideas for new content, only to be struck down by a bunch of reskins and comsetic updates. Not to mention, we've been hyped up for so many updates like Halloween or Christmas, but really, all we got were reskins, taunts and cosmetics. But it all came spiraling down once the Meet Your Match update came into reality. They ultimately removed quickplay and replaced it with casual and competitive. Not to mention, if you leave casual, you get a cooldown. But if you leave a competitive game, you're fine. Not to mention, competitive isn't free, you have to pay TWENTY DOLLARS FOR IT. If TF2 was still the same as it was back one year ago, I would definetley reccomend this game, but now? Not at all. It's just a mere cash grab for Valve.",

After 3 years playing this game, meeting a few awesome dudes there, buying a bunch of stuff for my main, medic... It trully pains me to write this review. The meet your match update killed this game's fun.  Basically, Valve forces everyone into either a very flawed competitive mode that also costs 12 euros (And it doesn't matter if you were the guy with most hours in the beta, you still gotta burn those 12 euros), and the new casual mode, which replaces quickplay. It's the MVM server finder, except it's even slower, it doesn't allow you to choose the map (Oh, you don't like cp_dustbowl? Too bad, buy a competitive pass!), and is overall way, way worse than the old quickplay, which wasn't perfect but was still good.  And then, at last, you're playing. And guess what, they also ruined the gameplay itself. Not because they nerfed/buffed anything too much or anything, but because of the new round system. What I loved from the game before was that you could just pick it up, and play two or three hours straight with the occassional map change as the only interruptions. If the map changed to a map you didn't like, or if the teams are incredibly unbalanced, you just jumped to another server. Now, the map changes every three rounds, after you are given your XP (more often than not you don't get it, but I digress), and if you want to change servers... hah, good luck, you're up to another fifteen minutes of waiting.  Finally, there's the issue of the hackers. There are so many more hackers now than there were before, it almost seems as if Valve just gave up on this game. Casual mode is, quite literaly, unplayable. What, tired of hackers? Buy a competitive pass!  This game was fun. It wasn't so serious (Heck, I loved going on battle medic rampages with my blutsauger from time to time), but it was the very definition of fun (remember the old motto, 'the most fun you can have online'? Such a shame). Now, they destroyed the fun part and desperatedly tried to please the hardcore competitive players with an extremely weak competitive mode, while attempting to railroad everbody into it as well. And, in the end, what we get is a game that looks like it's in beta. Except it's been out of beta for about 8 years.  But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that, they're Valve. They are never going to improve it. They don't have to care. They get more than enough money from their other games and specially, Steam itself. The tf2 economy, unlike what it may look like with all the sites dedicated to it, is next to nothing for Valve. They don't need TF2 at all. If it gets too bad, they'll just announce an AWESOME FINAL UPDATE, release some half ♥♥♥♥♥, rushed content, and then let the game go. And most likely, die.  I really wish to be wrong in that last statement. I really, trully wish I get comments on the lines of 'hah hah you idiot the game is AWESOME now', so I can come back to this review, delete it and replace it with a 2-line positive review, because I trully loved this game. But the thing is, I cannot let 'mostly positive' stand right under this game's title anymore, because right now it isn't positive. Eight years of overall positive reviews won't change, but at the very least I hope the 'recent' tab changes to 'mixed', so anyone who checks this game out for the first time knows something's up with it.",

Right outside the spawn you can see a sniper wielding the Sydney Sleeper, just going at it with the bodyshots. He has yet to get a kill, but he's still having fun. On the same map, up on the tower, you see an experienced Soldier with his Hale's Own rocket launcher, jumping where he wants to be and just farming kills. He's on his 15th kill this life.  Approaching in the air there's a rocket jumper Soldier with a market gardener. He crits the Soldier on the tower, 195 damage + knockback. The Soldier dies to the 'Trolldier'. The trolldier jumps away and approaching the top of the tower there's an Engineer. He places a minisentry on the top of the tower, but shortly thereafter he gets kicked by his teammates for ruining the TDM.  Down on the ground there's a scout and a heavy pushing the cart. They're both fairly new to the game, and they both seem suprised as to how they can push the cart that far without anyone contesting them. Around the corner, there's a crouched enemy Heavy with an unusual wielding a sandvich. The Heavy and the Scout take him out, and shortly thereafter they're both kicked. They just broke two TF2 rules- they killed a friendly and they pushed the cart on Hightower.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The thing about Team Fortress 2 is that all of the players above are probably having just as much fun. There's just so many diffrent ways to play this game, so many metas, so many mods, that everyone has something to do. If you're not enjoying pubbing that much- try competetive or trading!  If you're tired of that, try out mods like VSH or try rocket jumping or surfing! There's just so many things to do in this game. I've spent over 3500 hours on this game, and while I've been tired of TF2 many times before I've always come back. If I'm tired of surfing, I'll do pubbing. If I'm tired of pubbing, I'll try competetive. If I'm tired of comp it goes full circle.  TF2 has such an incredible and unique charm. It'll always hold a special place in my heart.",

        {
            "review_text": "This game is full of great things, and it's evident why this thing is so popular!  PROS  1: Class based warfare. The fact that this game has gone the class based system really adds some unique flavor to the traditional FPS scene.  2: Additional weapons are not uber powerful upgrades. This is something that works to this game's advantage! Every weapon you get out of luck is more of a Side-grade to your natural weapon which is actually the optimal weapon.  3: Cosmetic customization features DON'T effect the game(mostly). This is something that sets the stage for a lot of F2P games to suck, as most free games you play ask for you to buy what you want to win over everybody else. TF2 doesn't rely on that, and cosmetic items are a great way to show off your own style.  4: The most balanced F2P and modern FPS in the world! Unlike atrocities like Combat Arms(god I hate that annoying ♥♥♥♥...) the weapons are somewhat more balanced. Not the best balance, but clearly more balanced than the competition.  5: Intense multiplayer mode. this is a dealbreaker for this game! Since the focus is on TEAM play, it's only logical to encourage a great multiplayer mode. The sheer number of multiplayer modes are familiar main stays, all team variations of familiar modes. CTF, Control point, King of the Hill, and even adds some unique modes like VS Saxton Hale, and the user created 'Deathrun' and Race modes.  6: Each class has it's own personality! THIS is what can sell games! Each class has their own way of bragging, complaining, cheering, jeering, etc, the emotes really bring this home, it conveys a great personality for this game as each character is drastically different! No two classes play the same, and their personalities are actually hugely different.   CONS(This list was a LOT harder to come up with than you think)  1: the blance is not perfect. A somewhat minor issue, but what can you expect from a game with so much good going for it? The problem is, there's not really a way to avoid being one hit killed by a demoman grenade, a sniper bullet, or a spy backstab. what about making Soldier's rocket launcher a one hit kill weapon? Or at least follow through the 'Direct hit with a rocket means instant death' deal? I know there's a weapon called 'The Direct Hit' which has increased rocket damage, but it's not the same as a rocket with a decent blast radius like Quake 2.  2: Lacking in single player modes. It lets you play on maps you're familiar with, but if you picked up maps online, there are no bots to play against you. Of the more fun maps, there are Balloon race, and Wacky Races, which are the ebst user-made maps to date! These maps could use some bots running around for the thrill of it! Just in case you lose your connection or want to practice alone. The lack of a story mode is also a problem, what if I want to play alone and enjoy a story? Or even a more fleshed out tutorial that helps me learn how to counter classes against me using certain mechanics. A single player campaign with some old school flare would do this game a lot of good for solo players.  3: Inability to host games yourself on your own computer. This seems to be a trend with a LOT of games hosted on Steam. If you've not paid to host your own private server, you can't play exclusively with your friends. I remember old school LAN parties where players could make their own servers using their own computer to host their games. Why not do that for TF2? It's not impossible.  4: Not enough customization/cosmetic slots. Some things look amazing together, and some things are too cool to shelve. I would personally love to show off all my badges and medals at once, while flaunting hats, costume, and other cosmetic pieces, but there's not enough slots for them.  5: No 'Gender equality'. The lack of female versions of characters is kinda depressing. Given the timeline of the game, it's not surprising, but it isn't really that big of a deal. It's actually historically accurate which is very good. This is only really a major gripe if you want to play through gender equality. The only character who is androgynous enough to fit either or both male or female roles is Pyro, but that class is a lunatic engrossed in a fantasy world of balloonicorns and cartoony horns that shoot rainbows instead of spewing firey death!  6: The presence of jerks and griefers. This is a personal player to player concern, and not really Valve's fault. Griefers are going to walk in and cheat or exploit their way to claiming they have 'MVP status' or 'Top MVP'. These toxic abusers of the game, including 'Squeakers' plague the game. If there was a 'report Micspam/Squeaker' function that muted a player on a server for the benefit of everyone who voted to mute them on every server, it would be great. Simply muting them doesn't lways help, as some of these toxic players simply logout, then rejoin the map to get around being muted.   The Pros are huge compared to how minor the Cons are, but I recommend this game! At least until the CA fantards start crying for Sniper to be godmoded... I hate being picked off by a sniper... Rockets need to be a top damage one hit kill on quishy classes weapon.",

I say, one too many, twenty too many, the first time I saw 'friendlies' I already disliked them. There are community server that are all about friendlies, and I admit, I sometimes go on them because that's what brought me to Team Fortress 2, but I always kept the fun on fun servers, I always try my best on objective focused servers, and what some people decide to do is not only be dead weight on their team, but also help enemy team. With addition of Casual mode, in about 30 matches I still haven't seen a single friendly... Everyone is focused on the objective, chat is actually used to communicate, and people say 'gg' or just rage in the chat after a loss or a win instead of it just being silence between rounds. Now if you win or lose you can see it being justified, and not just because a Heavy that was supposed to defend the last control point was sharing Sandviches with enemy Demoman. The levels are purely cosmetic, you get xp no matter if you lose or win, but somehow the casual mode added this semi-competetive element to the game and sense of progression. Casual has some problems, but they are being fixed, you can't choose a map, but it's being made by TF2 team right now, you can't votekick but this issue will be adressed later. This gamemode gave me what I wanted, a stress free way to achieve an imaginary 'rank' that doesn't reflect the way I play, while also making people actually play the game for once.",

Add to this the fact that TF2 is free - it makes for a great deal! :D I bought the game along with The Orange Box via retail, so I have a premium account; and boy, is it worth it. Though there isn't a lot of difference in free and premium, you should buy it (I recommend the orange box - it costs like USD15 when bought via retail in India, and just USD15 for 5 games is awesome!). The multiplayer game modes including King of the Hill, Payload, Control Points, are all great. The team behind this game releases new game modes as free updates at times (the Halloween game mode) - these 'extra' game modes are epic! You aren't even restricted to one set of weapons, you can keep collecting weapons via random drops or craft them; almost every weapon in the game is obtainable in this way, excluding limited edition ones, etc. The new co-op mode (Mann vs Machine) has added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. THUMBS UP!",

Unlike other games, such as CoD, tf2 has no weapon unlock system and the weapons are as balanced as possible (unlike games like CoD where a weapon is better than another no matter what). The game play is very fast and fun. You need to pay attention to everything around you in order to play at the best of your abilities. Even though there is a limited number of weapons (there is quite alot though) there is always new gameplay stratigies and tactics to discover and learn. No one class is the best class to play, each one has their own advantages and disadvantages that may make it better to take out one class but harder to counter another. Many people that begin playing tf2 often give up quickly thinking they are not good enough, but everyone needs practice we all started bad at one time. Even if you are not getting alot of kills you can still be a great deal of help to the other team by being a distraction, providing health and damage buffs, or picking off a single class on the other team that would otherwise give your team a dissadvantage.   Regarding the trade system, i consider it a quite good economic simulator. I have used the trade system to gain funds in my steam wallet and buy even more games without the need to spend alot of cash in real life.  Team Fortress 2 also has things such as a costom scripting system, and the ability to make your own hats and game modles. But that is mostly not for all people and tf2 is not generally played for that.",

They keep adding things while still keeping it balanced, with a few notable exceptions. (google Short Circuit, heh) It has lots of game modes, and they keep adding more as well...with Mannpower and its grappling hooks currently in beta. There are tons of communities...many are mature, many are not. There's surely at least one for you and you'll make friends, spend thousands of hours playing. The best part is, it's not an MMO...it's a real competitive and cooperative FPS that you can pick up and put down at any time.  Getting bored of the standard game modes? Try mod servers. Versus Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2 are the undisputed kings of the modding scene, but there's Deathrun, Prop Hunt, Dodgeball, FortWars, Jailbreak (not my thing, but meh), Slender, Hidden, TF2 Ware, TF2 karts, and so much more. The TF2 dev team has done plenty to rope people in, but it's the modders that fill in the gaps. With the absurd gameplay variety stemming from nine distinct classes, and a Player vs Player foundation, it's impossible to get bored of this game.  Also, you might see a hat or two.

I DO NOT WANT the authenticator on my phone, thats my choice and I am free to go by that. If Valve want to force this upon me they lost a customer and I will happily sell all my items and leave this joke of a game for Overwatch.  Valve are officially as bad if not worse than EA, If there are still people around that love Valve and think Gaben is god, they are delusional.  And before people comment about the pc authenticator.

Tf2 Is a good time to waste days at home as its fun and addicting aswell with it's core hat gameplay Gripping hat storyline and hat fighing. Thanks Valve!'  I was upset to delete my original positive review for this game as TF2 used to be my favorite game on steam. I've been playing this game since I got steam almost 3 years ago. I made friends, made scrap, p*ssed people off and generally had a good time. 840 hours of fun.  As the years go past, people change and so did this game.  What I loved about TF2 is that it was just a game you could get into and play. Then an update came out for competitive. But quickplay was still there. Great! So now the more casual gamers can be casual and the competitive people can be competitive. But recently, something happened. TF2 became a mess. When I booted up TF2, everything has changed. I was now being ranked for casual gaming? It takes forever to join anything now, the new gamemodes made no sence, the menus are confusing and if I'm honest, it's just become more stale than before. Everything was a mess.  I think I know why, TF2 is trying to keep up with the overwatch market. (Never played overwatch but I've heard good things about it) but alot of us loved tf2 for its simplicity.  I haven't completely given up on tf2 but, I want the old tf2 back. The fun tf2  P.S: End of the line and onwards was Bullsh*t as many of you are aware. Thanks Synch for reminding me!",

It's a good comic-style shooter and it has a lot of funny stuff in it, such as voices, jokes, etc. etc. What can I tell about this game? The game is part of the Orange Box, one of the most successful games Valve made, besides Half-Life of course. Play as 1 of the 9 classes. There are 2 ways to play too! Just play with people and shoot all the enemies you see OR you can go afk in an idle-room and farm items, which is just a waste of time, in my opinion.  Team Fortress 2 wasn't free in the beginning, it was around €20 and you'd get Garry's Mod and Portal with it. It was a nice game, fun, kind people. There were a lot of equal and skiled players, but there was a limited amount of maps. like 3-5 maps only! Suddenly Valve decided to make it Free-to-Play and noobs visited the game. Now the game is full of idling players, grinding for items, buying hats and crafting them. The game is not about the shooting anymore, it's about hats.  My opinion since they made it a Free-to-Play game: It was good, now it's a useless game. Luckiy there are still players left that actually play. Yes, it's fun to look cool and impress other players with your hats, gloves, necklace or whatever, but that is not what the game is about.  Rating: 6/10 If it wouldn't be Free-to-Play and the shooting was still the main purpose of the game, I would give it a 9/10. Now it's just a fun game for a couple hours and getting hats which you never use, since you don't actually play matches. Still worth a try though. Do notice that you cannot trade items, unless you bought at least 1 item with real money in the store.",
