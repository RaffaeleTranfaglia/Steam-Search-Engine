            "review_text": "This is my first foray into hardcore/realistic MMO shooters.  Being used to playing CS, my first few games were utter confusion. I couldn't distinguish friends from enemies, I just can't aim fire and run at the same time. Run into an enemy face to face when you turn a corner? Good luck getting that shot in while your mind just blanks out.  My first ever thought when playing the game was 'Why is everyone running?'. Where are they going? It was just utter confusion.  But after a few hours, I was hooked. I've learned to flank the enemy. Fire a rifle when it counts. And minimize shooting at my own team mates. But all that pales in comparison to the experience. You get to feel the confusion a battle brings, the paranoia, and the panic when you find out your commander just ordered an artillery attack on the very place you are standing on and running back to safer ground while your teammates mistake you for an attacking enemy.  It's just spastic. One time, I accidentally shot a teammate while he was about to throw a grenade. Needless to say, everyone in the room died.   Yes, I am that kind of a noob.  That said, the community is great. I mean, better than others if I may say. I would like to describe it, for a lack of a better word, more mature. I guess because the game demands a lot more patience and understanding than a standard run and gun.   It's not for everybody. CS players would find this a bit taxing. And you do have to invest a bit of time to understand the mechanics. But for overall gameplay and enjoyment, for me at least, this one is on the top of my list.  And yeah, my teammates forgave me for that grenade drop.",

We are untrained and inexperienced, but equiped and ready to defend our motherland to the last man. Stories from the 62nd Army state that a Soviet soldier will only withdraw once his ammunition is spent, the building is in ruins, and their clothes are on fire.   We enter a the church of the village and pray to the God my country denies. The artillery bombardment begins, the floor begins shaking. Suddenly, our machine gunner spots germans and begins opening fire. He dies 5 seconds after. Some attempt to fire back at the Fascist invader, but they are gunned down as quick as the peek out. Smoke begins to cover the windows, the German infantry move in to take the church.  A Fascist scum jumps through the breach in the wall, and I quickly fire a shot off into his chest. He hits the ground before he could get on the other side. Another meets the same fate. The 3rd does it, I miss the shot, he hits me in the left arm, but I bolt the rifle quick enough to use my 4th shot before he can finish me off. I proceed to bandage my wound, and when the task is completed, 10 germans have entered the church. I lay on the ground, 1 bullet in my magazine, 10 germans, and they havn't noticed me. I couldn't fire or they would know.   I reached for my grenade and considered what I could do for my brothers who died killing the Fascist menace. I pulled the pin, and threw one at the far end of the church, and then pulled the pin on the second one before they could shoot me down. The church was cleared for now, but more Germans instantly reinforced and captured the church. I have died taking out 10 fascists with me, but my story will never be known, my sacrifice forgetten the moment after it happened. All witnesses will not make it out of the battlefield alive, and I had no family to mourn my death, as they have all been killed at the hands of the Germans.  10/10, Will turn you into a zealous nationalistic jihadist.",

They took objective A, B, and C so quickly that our fellow soliders began to panic. My Honor Rank is 73 and a squad leader for Squad Two. I ordered my men to fall back to Objective G, the outskirts of Druzhina, and command them to fortify the position. Squad One fought valiantly against the Russians on Objective D, but most of them were wiped out. The dense forest that cover Objective D and E favor the Russians than our German forces. The Bolsheviks were clever to use smoke grenades to advance their position while our men fired wildly into the thick, white smoke. What are they shooting at? Who knows.   As Objective E was spammed with Russians, the commander order the squad leaders, including me, to send in artillery coordinates. Unfortunately, there were too many artillery requests sent to the commander. The first coordinate is at the Russians on Objective E, the second coordinate is pointed directly at the Russian T-34, and the third coordinate was sent in close to Objective G. I was the one who sent in the third coordinate. I debated with my commander that the third coordinate is the best because the Russians would most likely be sending 2/3 of their forces to take G. The commander didn't listen and called the artillery at the first coordinate. As the artillery roars the sky and slams into the ground, the Russians were clever to run away from Objective E. Some of them died while the rest who were at Objective E rush to Objective G in a frontal assault. The machine gunner in my squad, whose Honor Rank is 58, fired his MG-34 in a control burst, but was killed by a sniper from 148 meters. I watch the machine gunner got shot and his body slump into the fragile, wooden floor. I was traumatized by this and order my men to not be exposed by the window. The rest of my squad consist of newer members, ranging the Honor Rank from 12 - 36 didn't listen to my command. The second squad member (Honor Rank - 26) was killed by the same sniper.   Two squad members killed and the Russians are swarming in front of the sandbags near Objective G...and I have to make a choice. I ordered my squad to suppress fire at the Russians while waiting for additional reinforcements to come and defend Objective G. Unfortunately, the Bolsheviks pulled a hard, right flank at Objective F, wiping out Squad Three in under 20 seconds. Even though my squad was able to pluck a few kills around Objective G, the Russians purposely made this frontal assault as a distraction so that their comrades can take Objective F. Knowing that Objective G would be overrun from the right side, I ordered my lower ranking members to retreat back to the apartments in Objective I. Strangely, there were signs of courage and fury in my men's eyes. One of the squad members (Honor Rank - 21, Anti-Tank class) demanded me to let him risk his own life as the T-34 rushes to the main road that leads to Druzhina. I refused in his request and ordered him to tactically withdraw, but he didn't listen. Before I was about to demand an order to him, he pulls out the Hafthohlladung anti-tank grenade and runs directly in front of the T-34. He starts to scream and was about to swing the grenade, but was mowed down in a hail of machine gun fire from the Russians. However, I heard an explosion and I took a slight peak in the window. The T-34's main gun was pointing in front of me and the last I said to my men is: Run! This is Red Orchestra 2.   ------------------------------ Review ---------------------------- Red Orchestra 2 is the ultimate first-person tactical shooter that advocate very strong team coodination and communication, complex cover system, and each life (or ticket) is precious. When playing as the Russian, German, American, or Japanese, each solider fight just to survive. There will be instances in the game that discourage reckless assaults or exposure to the enemy. You will learn the game by experience and not repeating the same mistakes twice. There are weapons, class, and character rankings that encourages replay value. The best experience you will get in Red Orchestra 2 is playing on a full server. You will hear the best team coordination, the best varieties of newer and veteran players, and the greatest responsibility for your own life and theirs. Red Orchestra 2 does not shy away from the actuality of war as you will hear meeps, horrific groans, and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. There is no 'I' in war; there is brother and comrade. Red Orchestra 2 is simply, the best tactical first-person shooter to ever develop.",

Our commander yells in chat as we continue to fight a losing battle, hoping to at least dwindle their numbers so they can't push through to other towns. I'm here with my bolt action, taking ineffective shots at the growing number of Axis soldiers moving into the point. My character curses his gun as he hides in cover to reload.  A teammate walks past me as I'm reloading, gun down, holding his stomach, and my character starts fumbling the magazine as I see him bleed to death. I peek from cover and take out a soldier. 'I'll never get these faces out of my head' is my character's last spoken words before the Axis take their victory.    You are infeebled as a player, and forced to rethink your strategy. As a rifleman, you're stuck on the back lines, firing at what you hope is not your own teammembers, trying to capture points with your horrible firearms. It's the only military shooter I've seen that features a sanity meter as it should, making the battle more intense and the characters more human.

            "review_text": "This game is very well done. I would recommend. I generally play TE-Realism (territory-realism) so cannot speak for much else, so I will focus on what I know.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Disclaimer-I wrote this the day the Troop Transport and etc. patch came out so I cannot talk for the new game mode nor have I encountered how the transports affected the gameplay (though I doubt this will change my review at all).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Now onwards:  First off, I would not recomend this game for a drop-in drop-out team-deathmatch style play. The real beauty in this game lies in it's tactical layout that is fully fleshed in the territory game mode, which has a chain of command from Lt. to Sgt. to Riflemen(or whatever you are playing as) with players taking each role as able. Platoon to squad to individual in other words.  In order to succeed in this game, teamwork is one-hundred percent essential. If you want to be an mg, you are going to need someone to give you ammo when you run dry and to protect your six. If you want to be a sniper, you have to pay attention to what your team is calling out, and to prioritize the correct targets (do you hit the enemy sniper, team leader, or engineer?).  Realism mode is exactly how it sounds. bullet pen. and deviation happens, getting shot in the leg slows you down, and if you don't patch your wounds you will bleed out and die (if you aren't killed outright already). AT rifles can't penetrate the SLOPED front armor, and the ppsh is a *ahem* on the recoil aspect.  Only three complaints: sometimes people join a match only to mess with others (via chat, TKs, etc.) This is not that big a problem, and if such a person arrives it is an easy procss to kick said individual. Secondly, the roles can be taken very quickly and sometimes matches are just bad (usually for the russians because the russians seem to never have good teamwork). With some patience and perseverence this can be over-come however. Finally, and my main complaint, people often drop out of matches when they are over. While this is not a bad thing per se, usually if a team gets absolutely wiped during a match almost invariably 50% of the team throws out some form of pessimistic 'this team sucks/what noobs/I hate my team' and quits the server. Invariably this only furthers the disparity in the teams, as one side slowly accrues vets who are have a lot of experience that day on the server working together while the other is constantly rotating new people who have base teamwork.  These problems are entirely player-based and as such are no fault on the game itself, and I 100% recomend this to whoever reads this.  It CAN be said that this game is extremely hard, both in the beginning and later on. I was there, dying sixty times a match, never getting a kill, etc. At level 60+ now I can honestly say, it is just experience. Like in a real war the greenies do poorly at first, so it is here. Just keep trying, find good people to play with, and learn from the vets and you should do fine. It IS a hard game, and it IS worth the trials you might face every once in a while.  EDIT: Troop Transports and whatnot did not affect the game in any negative way at all. While sometimes people cheese them and block doors to objectives, or use the mg as a mounted gun this only adds more to the realism of the game: people build barricades to defend themselves, and more mgs seems like a great idea. Plus, you can throw grenades over the transports. Both teams get transports if transports are on a map. While I do believe the Soviet is faster, the germans have a better gun and can carry more (i believe). All in all, still a most excellent game.",

In multi-player You can play as several diffrent roles, a few being: Commander, Squad Leader, Rifleman, etc., and all of these roles play a unique part in building a strong team. There is 1 Commander per team and this person's job is to manage and try to set up strategies that his whole team can agree on and execute with together, fire artilery, and other such things. Squad Leaders can act as moible spawn points for squad members, give commander marks to fire artilery on, use smoke grenades, and other things. Rifleman are the most common role, as the majority of the server's players will be rifleman. You have a bolt action rifle (as Americans in Rising Storm, it is possible you get the M1-Grand instead) and your job is to take the objective points and be supportive and coopertive of what your other team members ask you to do.    With game servers that can cap at 64 players, massive maps that can take 10 minutes to run across, one of the best atmospheres ever to be designed, great balance with roles and teams, a great community that works together as a team, and with the toping of higher-end graphics, Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm can easily be one of my favorite games and easily my favorite FPS.

            "review_text": "Red Orchestra 2 is the best ptsd simulator I have and may ever have played. It isn’t one of the best first person shooters or multiplayer games out there, and not necessarily the best WW2 game, and its single player isn’t particularly good at all. But without a doubt, the killing, the being killed and the plenty of in-between there is in this game makes Red Orchestra 2 a terrifying but great experience.  In this game, you are in one of four armies, Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Roosevelt's Americanos. A large percentage of the time spent in this game is having your back to the wall sh*t scared. There's bullets and shrapnel flying from every direction and you've got sh*t in your pants and countless deaths already. Every corner in this game, every room, nook and cranny can and will conceal someone from the opposing team, firing at you from every possible angle imaginable. The cover system in this game isn’t necessarily great (although the blind firing is pretty nice) but it works, so I'll give it that.  You've seen an enemy soldier, he's shot you or you've shot him and now he's dead. It's exactly like a million other games, but it feels nothing like any other game. the little things that make the difference, such as the sound of your own breathing when you lifted the rifle to your eye, and the way it bobbed around slightly in your hands. It's in the mark on your enemy's chest where the bullet hit, and the way his blood spurted from his back, making the mark of entry. The way they fell, with some weight to it like a real person. The way he clutches his stomach, yelling in German, the way he clutches and pulls the trigger madly firing the last ammo in his gun before departing.  The developers of this game thought that if the main interaction of the game is to kill, and kill and kill. You should probably make it feel great. It's the attention to detail that turns this from a generic war shooter to a battlefield. It makes it something great, making you feel more like you're the one actually pulling the trigger. The limited hud really adds to this; and I love the fact that you have to check the ammo in your magazine rather than having a counter in the corner of your screen.  The game modes are also great and fairly interesting. The most popular one is Territory, in which the offensive team is meant to capture multiple points on the map, whilst the other is to defend them. In this game each team has reinforcements which spawn every 15-20 seconds. The maps are made and designed to support 64 players. The reinforcement system works greatly because it finds a good way to deal with respawns and involve them with the setting of the game. These reinforcements allow the players to concentrate on the shifting frontline, going backwards and backwards until the offensive team has taken the map. Countdown mode has similar objectives, but players get just 1 life per round, where the teams swap sides halfway through, similar to how it works in games like competitive game modes in games like Counter Strike. Firefight, a team deathmatch variant to the game is fairly popular but feels as if it doesn’t really belong in the game. Territory is the only real active gamemode as of now.  The weapons feel remarkable, and the classes that carry them are fairly familiar from other games. The assault class with an SMG, a marksman sniper class, a rifleman and an elite rifleman variant as well as a few others like the tank commander or engineer. The few inventive classes such as Commanders or Squad leaders do little to change the flow of gameplay however. Both roles have valuable abilities but the players on public servers rarely interact with one another asking for smokescreens or giving commands as the squad leader.  Tanks don’t add much to the experience. They require a different set of skills to use well and have lovingly detailed interiors. They are an easily disposed of or ignored nuisance on the few maps that actually allow the players to utilize them.  The many deaths you will go through in this game put you constantly on the edge of your seat. Death is so violent and sudden that you’re constantly kept on edge, an experience made suspenseful by the little pieces of information kept from you by the game.  While this game was greatly enjoyable for me for the time i played it, it does not come without its flaws. RO2's bots barely funciton. The AI bots are almost blind, and will walk past and into the opposition without firing, and when they do it appears more to be in their general direction than an accurate shot. They're incredibly indecisive and will keep jumping through the same window and into the same trench repeatedly. If an AI is close enough he will quickly become a master swordsman, attempting to behead you with a katana or stick you with a bayonet like a pig; but, this can all be countered by walking backwards where he will infinitely chase you, most likely never firing.  In this game I've seen a machinegunner set up a gun with their backs to the enemy. I've seen them set up on a cabinet, I've seen them set up in their own trench facing away from gunfire. The soldiers have ran in infinite circles where they're unable to navigate a corner or a hallway of a buulding; infinitely retracing their own steps. I've seen allied and enemy tanks aline drive in a figure of eight indefinetly, or stop in front of me and never fire. This lack of the Artifical intelligence's intelligence makes the single player gamemode completely worthless, as it's a carbon copy of the multiplayer with a few slideshows of historical background inbetween.  RO2 is what it is. It’s a realistic World War 2 shooter that does what it does well. It’s a suspenseful and at times terrifying shooter with a unique twist to it. The game immerses you and doesn’t take you out for a while. It caused me to feel sadness upon watching a comrade of mine drop to the ground, and genuine fear when being aimed upon behind flimsy cover by a mounted gun in an apartment building.  I enjoyed this game greatly, and as such will give it an 7/10. It’s a fast paced and enjoyable game but nevertheless there are bugs and flaws that lower the rating.  Gg would get ptsd again",

            "review_text": "Red Orchestra 2 is the best ptsd simulator I have and may ever have played. It isn’t one of the best first person shooters or multiplayer games out there, and not necessarily the best WW2 game, and its single player isn’t particularly good at all. But without a doubt, the killing, the being killed and the plenty of in-between there is in this game makes Red Orchestra 2 a terrifying but great experience.  In this game, you are in one of four armies, Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Roosevelt's Americanos. A large percentage of the time spent in this game is having your back to the wall sh*t scared. There's bullets and shrapnel flying from every direction and you've got sh*t in your pants and countless deaths already. Every corner in this game, every room, nook and cranny can and will conceal someone from the opposing team, firing at you from every possible angle imaginable. The cover system in this game isn’t necessarily great (although the blind firing is pretty nice) but it works, so I'll give it that.  You've seen an enemy soldier, he's shot you or you've shot him and now he's dead. It's exactly like a million other games, but it feels nothing like any other game. the little things that make the difference, such as the sound of your own breathing when you lifted the rifle to your eye, and the way it bobbed around slightly in your hands. It's in the mark on your enemy's chest where the bullet hit, and the way his blood spurted from his back, making the mark of entry. The way they fell, with some weight to it like a real person. The way he clutches his stomach, yelling in German, the way he clutches and pulls the trigger madly firing the last ammo in his gun before departing.  The developers of this game thought that if the main interaction of the game is to kill, and kill and kill. You should probably make it feel great. It's the attention to detail that turns this from a generic war shooter to a battlefield. It makes it something great, making you feel more like you're the one actually pulling the trigger. The limited hud really adds to this; and I love the fact that you have to check the ammo in your magazine rather than having a counter in the corner of your screen.  The game modes are also great and fairly interesting. The most popular one is Territory, in which the offensive team is meant to capture multiple points on the map, whilst the other is to defend them. In this game each team has reinforcements which spawn every 15-20 seconds. The maps are made and designed to support 64 players. The reinforcement system works greatly because it finds a good way to deal with respawns and involve them with the setting of the game. These reinforcements allow the players to concentrate on the shifting frontline, going backwards and backwards until the offensive team has taken the map. Countdown mode has similar objectives, but players get just 1 life per round, where the teams swap sides halfway through, similar to how it works in games like competitive game modes in games like Counter Strike. Firefight, a team deathmatch variant to the game is fairly popular but feels as if it doesn’t really belong in the game. Territory is the only real active gamemode as of now.  The weapons feel remarkable, and the classes that carry them are fairly familiar from other games. The assault class with an SMG, a marksman sniper class, a rifleman and an elite rifleman variant as well as a few others like the tank commander or engineer. The few inventive classes such as Commanders or Squad leaders do little to change the flow of gameplay however. Both roles have valuable abilities but the players on public servers rarely interact with one another asking for smokescreens or giving commands as the squad leader.  Tanks don’t add much to the experience. They require a different set of skills to use well and have lovingly detailed interiors. They are an easily disposed of or ignored nuisance on the few maps that actually allow the players to utilize them.  The many deaths you will go through in this game put you constantly on the edge of your seat. Death is so violent and sudden that you’re constantly kept on edge, an experience made suspenseful by the little pieces of information kept from you by the game.  While this game was greatly enjoyable for me for the time i played it, it does not come without its flaws. RO2's bots barely funciton. The AI bots are almost blind, and will walk past and into the opposition without firing, and when they do it appears more to be in their general direction than an accurate shot. They're incredibly indecisive and will keep jumping through the same window and into the same trench repeatedly. If an AI is close enough he will quickly become a master swordsman, attempting to behead you with a katana or stick you with a bayonet like a pig; but, this can all be countered by walking backwards where he will infinitely chase you, most likely never firing.  In this game I've seen a machinegunner set up a gun with their backs to the enemy. I've seen them set up on a cabinet, I've seen them set up in their own trench facing away from gunfire. The soldiers have ran in infinite circles where they're unable to navigate a corner or a hallway of a buulding; infinitely retracing their own steps. I've seen allied and enemy tanks aline drive in a figure of eight indefinetly, or stop in front of me and never fire. This lack of the Artifical intelligence's intelligence makes the single player gamemode completely worthless, as it's a carbon copy of the multiplayer with a few slideshows of historical background inbetween.  RO2 is what it is. It’s a realistic World War 2 shooter that does what it does well. It’s a suspenseful and at times terrifying shooter with a unique twist to it. The game immerses you and doesn’t take you out for a while. It caused me to feel sadness upon watching a comrade of mine drop to the ground, and genuine fear when being aimed upon behind flimsy cover by a mounted gun in an apartment building.  I enjoyed this game greatly, and as such will give it an 7/10. It’s a fast paced and enjoyable game but nevertheless there are bugs and flaws that lower the rating.  Gg would get ptsd again",

            "review_text": "TL;DR The best tactical and WW2 FPS on the market. Realistic weapons, wide variety of maps, harsh and unforgiving, and the most authentic experience of the horrors of war in a video game.  The main game (Red Orchestra 2), is set on the eastern front, and the expansion (Rising Storm), is set in the pacific theater. Weapons depend on which of these you play, but weapons can range from rifles like the M1 garand and Kar98k, to the M12 shotgun, to MGs like the mg42, to the BAR, and even to flamethowers, all made with precise detail of the original weapons. The main game, territory, consists of one attacking and defending team. Attackers cap points by getting men into different capzones, and defenders try to stop them. Reinforcements are simulated with respawns and each team has a limited amount of tickets (lives), and there is a time limit in each round. The maps can be huge, and they are very varied, requiring the use of flanking, smoke grenades, artillery, tank support, and aerial recons to play well enough to win. This game is very unforgiving, and you'll die alot at first, espicially if you play on the realistic, the recommended mode.  There are various roles in the game, rifleman being your basic infantrymen, to roles like machine gunner and engineer, up to squad leaders and a commander, who issues out artillery and recons from a radio. All of these have their own details, so it's best to read up on how to play them, though riflemen is a good starting role. There are also vehicles, such as tanks and infantry trucks, available on some maps, these being the more larger maps. The damage model is harsh, one rifle shot to the chest usually being a one hit kill. The gunplay mechanics are very satisfying, there being bullet drop and different parts of the body that can be damaged. There are no special skins or perks here, nearly all weapons using the good old ironsights. Gameplay is usually slow, as rushing into a point will just get you killed, even if you have an smg at hand. Careful waves of attack, and setting up a good defence are crucial.  One thing done really well in this game is to show the horrors of war. This game is very gory, including dismemberment from things like explosives. Heavy fire or artillery will make your game shake and go grey, as if suppressed. There are the screams of pain from your fellow soldiers, wishing to be somewhere else. There are some pretty harsh and even racist taunts that can be spoken, adding to the realism of the game. This game is really good at showing both sides as human, instead of the usual bad guys vs good guys, this being army vs army, nothing more.   The community itself is generally of a good level whilst playing, and it's easy enough playing in a squad on your own if friends aren't available. I've had my fair share of interesting occasions, like someone spamming Rick Astley's 'Never gonna give you up', people 'roleplaying' as soldiers of their respective teams, and a hacker who somehow kicked every singe person from a server, but instead of being shown a kick message, it said that you were banned. Of course, I wasn't banned, and this person did not do this again, at least not to me.  One thing this game does well is keep you playing. I've played more than 50 hours, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of this game in terms of roles and tactics. This game will take a very long time to become truly good at it, or even master it.  Overall, one of the best Tactical FPS out there, and a must buy.",

            "review_text": "This is another World War 2 First Person Shooter, but with a few key differences: it's set in the Eastern European Theatre, and you're not the badass mobile sentry you're regarded as in other FPS games.  You don't hide behind cover, waiting for your Eagle-headed God to provide technical long-term immunity from lead poisoning. You don't just walk into the battlefield, explosions left and right, and expect everything to be sweet. You don't even have convenient vision overlays to tell you how many more steps to take until you win.  Combat is vicious, it's the real deal. One bullet will either drop you on the spot or cause you a world of trouble before giving in to shock and blood loss. The level of detail is astonishing: projectiles are affected by ballistics and require both leading the target and sighting in/aiming higher.  There are multiple classes available to play, each suited to specific roles: the Sharpshooter is given a scoped rifle to pick off high value targets like Commanders, who can send in airstrikes and lead teams, and Squad Leaders, who can use smoke grenades for covering their advance and work as mobile spawn points.   You even have Tanks, but not in the revolutionary 'One-Crew' format: you start with a Tank Commander, a Driver, a Cannon operator and a Loader. All are necessary for the tank to work well, otherwise you'll have to constantly switch seats, which takes time. Tank shells have believable physics as well, and can either punch through side/rear/top armor or deflect harmlessly.  But all classes are heavily restricted, usually no more than 4 of them on most maps. The only general exception, the Rifleman, is both the cannon fodder and the most important asset of the team, much like Chess.  Despite looking fairly drab and brown most of the time, the game looks very pretty - Scenery Gorn runs amok in the heavily bombed areas of Stalingrad. With a hellish warzone as this, what would you expect?  The audio is amazingly immersive, for both good and bad. Native voice acting compliments this, in addition to giving you a good chance to not understand most of the chatter.  Finally, your (many) inevitable deaths at the hands of other human players will be accompanied by gurgling of vital fluids, breathless gasps for one more lungful of air, or heart breaking cries from your stricken soldier to see their loved ones before expiring in a dirty trench. That is, if you're lucky enough not to get killed by an explosion, which tears off your limbs and leaves you a bloody mess  screaming  in pain.  Stalingrad wasn't a victory for one side and defeat for the other.  Stalingrad was a complete massacre for both sides.    Thankfully,  Heroes  of Stalingrad is a very, very good multiplayer first person shooter set in the Eastern European Front of the Second World War.",

Overall the story and the story-telling are good, but the low performance optimization, the bad A.I. and a bunch of bugs really make the singleplayer experience worse than it should be.  On the multiplayer side this game really shines, all the problems of the singleplayer were fixed, good graphics and performance, less bugs and good A.I. The tactical and realistic style that this game has is really hard to find in other videogames, i can only compare it to a mix of Arma and BattleField mechanics: lots of different classes with actually different roles, vehicles, covers, medium/large-sized maps (but smaller then Arma or BF), character and weapons experience levels and a realistic game mode in which you die with a single rifle shot or a small assault rifle burst.  At the beginning the game can look hard and not appealing but once you get to know the basics and the mechanics you will start to love it: for this i suggest everyone to play the campaign first, even if it's the worse part of the game, that will help you enjoy the multiplayer.

From Medal of Honor back in the day, to Call of Duty, Battlefield series, Halo, Killzone, you name it I've played it.   But I just love the tactical nature of RO2, the team work really feels like you are a part of an army battling for supremacy. The realistic nature took me awhile to get use to as I died hundreds of times when I blindly would run straight into battle. But learning the value of life, and just how close you are to death really makes this game thrilling. You can die at anytime from anywhere! Now this might sound terrible, but it's so satisfying when you get the jump on your opponent.   It's a great great game, great challenge loads of fun. I hope they release British troops, and US vs German maps soon.  ",

It is always great and challenging with large player amounts and some of the maps are brilliant as well.  Depending on your play style, there is a role for you. The most numerous one are rifleman which are very efficent to use. Nothing is better then outshooting a LMG or a Assualt trooper with a bolt action.  Rising Storm is also strongly recommended since you take part in the Pacific theatre one area that has pretty much mostly been ignored by the big dev's. Flame Throwers and Mortar men are incredibly annoying, but due to that using them makes a sense to get rid of them as soon as possible. My fav gun / upgrade on RS is the BAR with the Foregrip as it makes it a incredibly great gun for all ranges.  The Unlock system on both parts is annoying and was not a fan of when first released, but now it is growing on me, due to have most of the stuff for the weapons unlocked now.  Custom Maps are a must play for the game, as nearly all of them are great fun to play and better then the standard ones. Sadly though for maps Apartments (More or less Danzig from RO:OST) and Fallen Fighters appear to be very popular on vote servers, these are the two maps i dislike the most. The latter since it just allows easy camping. For Fallen Fighters try the map Streets of Stalingrad, since it is basicly a better version of it.  I recommend this game strongly. If you are unsure about the play style. Get it when it is on sale, Be prepared to be annoyed to begin with, you will get used to it and take care, since it is not a run and gun game.",

You gain the ability to play the other when you purchase one of them, but you will not be able to pick anything but rifleman class or level up.  By far one of the most interesting experiences in online gaming. Merril's Mauraders' two servers are the only ones I found worth playing for realism mode (one for Rising Storm, one for RO2) I can't really speak for the single player campaign or any other game modes as I haven't been drawn to play them. Enjoy the wide variety of characters you will experience producing a number of different sounds, songs, and racial profiling statements over mic chat. There are some really good teammates you will get that will lead you or follow you to topple your enemies. There are also abstracted young ones who like to get tunnel vision and charge foward, throwing a grenade into the trench you're sitting in without so much as checking their map to see what's in front of them, or that they are still behind the frontline. Enough about that.  The game is a lot like playing a Battlefield game. Squad leaders are the beacons that their members can spawn on, so their positioning and protection is key to avoid losing ground. There are a few gameplay modes but I have only played realism campaign in which both sides vie for a number of territories in an attempt to control more or wipe out completely the enemy force until the other breaks. This is done by either team attacking or defending. Usually it will rotate between maps. There is a lot of importance in having experience with the game and the maps played, because you need a good Team Leader that understands the tactics that the team should follow in order to best help the campaign overall, not just each individual battle. If you have the audacity to learn about the game and become a good leader please play this game because it's a way better experience with good team leaders and people that can cooperate. Those of you who play team games like CS:GO or 'MOBA's and always blame your team for everything need not apply.  The realism is there; bullet drop, suppresion, wounds that affect your performance... Bullet drop feels very accurate and satisfying especially using a bolt-action rifle. You will feel like a marksman when you lead a shot on a running target from many meters away. You can even adjust for elevation on some of the guns. The suppresion is interesting but can also be very annoying in things like one-on-one gunfights where someone begins to shoot at you and you get aimpunched without them actually hitting you. It can also be tough to tell exactly where enemies are firing from - it seems like muzzle flash isn't nearly as noticable as it should be on darker maps. It can also be strange to not really be able to hear which direction machine gun fire is coming from sometimes. The bullet wounds had me disconnected a bit when my forearm was injured and my soldier decided to throw a grenade with that arm instead of his good one. Let's just say it didn't get thrown very far. Besides that I guess I should talk about how rediculous the amount of recoil is on the mg42 where people will climb through windows with it and hipfire the thing without much trouble laying waste to everything. It's not nearly as bad as the flamethrower in Rising Storm, but Japan has knee mortars, the ability to kamikaze-grenade without losing tickets / set traps, and banzai charge (allowing them to sometimes eat bullets for breakfast) .. so I guess it's sort of fair.. These things set Rising Storm apart from RO2, but I enjoy both. But if you do suck at shooters and decide Red Orchestra is too real for you, just play Rising Storm and load in before everyone else, pick allies and get the flamethrower and just spray it in the general direction of the enemy for free kills.  The main problem with this game is if you run it at certain graphical settings rendering goes into space. You will see through everything on and off. Terrain, walls, train cars, cars, fences... will provide a false sense of security when you think you're being sneaky and in reality someone's game decides to give him free 'ESP' (wallhacks) and he knows you're there. I have more of an issue of it happening to me because it just feels really boring and cheap at that point to just see every enemy around you, but this should not really happen to anybody. My friend said to use the console command 'Umbra calling' but it doesn't help. Granted I could play on higher settings but I should not have to just so that more than half of the level renders. Not to mention switching graphical settings 99% of the time means forcing you to restart your game. I think it's mainly a problem with RO2 and not really Rising Storm, but I still wouldn't recommend them for $20 a piece.  Final verdict; Wait until it goes on sale.",

Truly on of the hardest and most realistic WWII/war/shooter games out there, and most (hopefully) the closest you'll ever get to a real war. If you're ever tired of going Rambo in CoD, then try this on for size.   Granted, as the game pushes for realism, the key roles ( sniper/squad leader/commander/tank commander) must be filled by people with some clue of the game, and new recruits filling up those spots can lead to your team's defeat, some vissible weapon advantages are also causing unbalance, and the morale system isn't that easy to figure out and fails sometimes. The game also doesn't provide much for game modes, seeing as territory is the only mode (but there are enough maps to keep you busy, and anyway, a deathmatch mode were people die by one bullet wouldn't last that long anyway, so this mode is more than enough).   All in all you can't really call yourself a FPS or action guy if you don't play this game. 8.5/10",

I can't really say how good this game is. It really depends on how long your willing to suffer through. Can you work through getting hit by 1 shot over and over until you realize that you need to be in cover to advance? will you realize that you have no reason to be in the speacialized roles, and switch to rifleman in defeat or will you actually learn to work that class? This is nothing like CoD or BF. You are a soldier, given a rifle and through time become a killing machine. A true hero, that will be able to recover faster, go farther without tiring, and take more before giving in to the pain. They will inspire the others, and can easily sway the battles in the right moments.  Now Rising storm on the other hand is a completly different beast. You have the americans, semi auto and fully automatic rifles, heavy fire power and flame throwers. They do their job through pure strenght of arms, and hitting the enemy hard where it hurts fast. The japanese? They have normal rifles, and a full auto smg. Just one though. They also have though is they ability to plant mines with their grenades via pressure caps on them, they also can gain points by suicide running at the enemy with a grenade primed. This gives them points, and they suffer no penalty for killing themselves. they also have knee mortars so they dont have to wait for artillary to fall to blow them up at range. They also have the ability to banzai, which is their greastest assest they have. When the japanese banzai in a sufficently sized group, say 5-7 people, This causes the americans to panic HARD. They wont be able to aim, they be suppresed badly, and on top of that the japanese can take A LOT of damage during it. The japanese live and die with honor, and they won't stop until the americans are dead or going with them.   I personally think there is nothing at all like Rising storm. Nothing has ever came as close to showing what both sides did to win, and the huge difference in attitude and weapons was. This game is a must have for any person that wants a realistic, but not too realistic though there is a mode for that, shooter set in the time of staligrad.   TL;DR: This game is what you need if you're looking for a realistic like first person WW2 shooter. Buy rising storm and you get everything with it. There is no paid DLC, the only thing that is Is Rising Storm and that gets you everything though. Be prepared to be angry, and want to give up. But press on and you'll be rewarded with a gereat game.",

Why? Lets see. (i mean here clear Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad, there is no single word about Rising Storm(I have some words about its balance though.))  First thing i've noticed, after one of first updates, that axis side are get better stamina and resistance to suppressing. Few easy examples - while i was playing as axis soldier, i gotta take like 5 - 4 smg rounds, 1-2 rifle rounds before i die.(even in deadly points like - balls, stomach, heart, head.) while i was playing as allied - its 3 smg rounds or 1 rifle round to get killed. Surpressing are even more funny thing. Sometimes while i was playing as axis, i was getting just half suppressed, without shaky hands, while was running in front of Maxim mg.... And no, my ping ain't the thing. i was playing on 'close by' servers with ping max 70. When they've added PPS-42 it became a bit easier because some 'hamsters' switched to it from PPSH, and it's ain't that good as PPSH. 'Oh well, i still can play and its still fun.' - thought i, and then mg42 update rolled in..... And here we go. Connecting to any server - you are being meet by rambo with 99lvl with fully upgraded Mg42 and here we go - full ♥♥♥ of lead. Almost five years ago with all bugs and glitches (i can even forgive that this game was so ♥♥♥♥ed up and crashy on release on first few months because after it was finally updated with stable patch it finally became... heh... stable and fun.) this game was fun, because there wasnt such things as stamina buff or 'exclusive' weapon which are now ruined whole balance.  This game are ain't about Defenders or balance anymore as it was said before. This game are about invaders now.  What can i say about whole situation? Well first - Dont try to play as allied soldier because there is like few problems: 1)It's 90% chance that you'll lose. 2)A Lot of Noobs and kids who are shooting everything on sight, or taking smg classes and just camping somewhere while gotta attack. 3)You'll meet few lads with mg42 and few mp40 and you'll just get gangbanged. So if you wanna easy play - play axis. If you wanna easy pain and loosing almost every time - play allies.  P.S. All above are my personal opinion I'm not trying to force someone to accept or understand it. i'm just saying those facts i've noticed.",

If you are a Call of Duty fan, you may want to rethink your battle tactics when it comes to fighting with your team. The biggest thing in this game that makes it fun to play is TEAM WORK! I mean, you can be a long wolf like a marksman or machine gunner, but if you want to get the full potential of the game, play with friends( if you don't have any on steam, make some, yeah I'm talking to you COD players). This game is a huge improvement over the original Red Orchestra, I'm going to name only a few fixes they have made. First, and most importantly, graphics. The graphics in this game are a huge improvement over the original, if you don't believe me go see an eye doctor. Second, the shooting mechanics. I don't know why but the shooting just seems better in this game maybe it's just me. Third, cover and mantling. Finally, A FPS that lets you actually take cover behind nearly any object, building, obstacle, and vehicle in the game. The mantiling in the game is amazing compared to the original in that YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF BREATHE JUMPING OVER A FENCE! Oh, and by the way, you can jump in this game(yeah I'm talking to both of you COD and Battlefield fans). Now let me say this, YOU WILL DIE ALOT(and I mean alot)IF YOU DON'T WORK WITH YOUR TEAM AND DON'T MOVE FROM COVER TO COVER! Stay out of the open and keep your heads down. Now there is one thing I forgot to mention to COD and Battlefield fans(if they made it this far into the review) that I think will make them want to get this game. YOU CAN CAMP THE ENTIRE GAME AND NOBODY(and I mean nobody) WILL EVER GET MAD AT YOU FOR CAMPING. In fact, if you hold a position down, you'll get a high five from the commander saying 'good job', Because in this game(especially if your defending) camping is what happens. Overall this game is awesome and you should buy it(especially now since it's on sale, but go buy rising storm instead, it includes this game as well). I'd give this game an 8.5/10 and is definitly my second favorite WW2 shooter of all time(World at War still has that special place in my library).",

From the graphic side the game is awesome looking and you don't need to have high-end PC. So for the graphics it's 8/10. But the biggest problem of this game is singleplayer. Trust me bots in this game are just completely crazy and stupid and campaign doesn't have anything to offer. It's just like multiplayer only with bots. So for singleplayer it deserves only 4/10. But after all multiplayer is just amazing you'll have tens to hundreds of hours great fun. So for me this games is great FPS and it deserves 7,5/10. For this price you should buy it!

            "review_text": "Red Orchestra 2 and its buddy Rising Storm are without a doubt the best quality FPSs out there. I've played shooters of all kinds, from Halo to Gears of War to Call of Duty to Battlefield and even once to Arma. This one is a gem, this one is the best. The biggest fault with the game is that not enough people are playing it. I can not recommend this game enough.  RO2/RS is a World War II-based shooter, which makes many people roll their eyes because the WWII genre seems to have been 'played out' in the eyes of many. In Red Orchestra 2, you take the sides of either the Red Army or the Wehrmacht, fighting for control of the area surrounding the city of Stalingrad. In Rising Storm, which can be purchased seperately or with the RO2 multiplayer mode exclusively, you get to pick from the United States of America or the Empire of Japan, fightng for control of islands in the southwest Pacific. Neither of these are particularly original locations, but that doesn't take away from the game.  There are two basic modes: a single-player and a multiplayer. Single player...well...I've never played it, but people tell me it is glitchy and not that fun, although it is a great way to get used to the mechanics of the game. Multiplayer is a very team-based experience, with hoardes of soldiers on both sides vying for control of some of the largest maps in FPS history.   The mechanics are incredible, combinding the best aspects of the best shooters. In harcore mode, which is the only multipalyer mode that gets played, where a bullet strikes the body deritmines if you live, die, or are wounded. Most of the time, it's a one-hit-kill, and this is true of all weapons. Bullet damage mechancis do not vary as they do in most games. Bullets also drop, forcing you to consider the velocity of roudns flying out of your rifle and the beaten-zone created by them hitting the ground. This makes sniping very difficult, and snipers in the game generally are actually the best shots in the community. You can adjust your sights and check your ammo (you have to in hardcore mode, since there is virtually no HUD). Your soldier gets tired, and he also gets afraid. He will paralyze with fear if you do not take care of him, and you will wear him out if you run him too far. Every gun has it's own feel; no two guns, even upgraded verisons of the same gun, are alike.  This is truly war at its worst. And for a video game, that means at its best. Struggling to make it to the front lines, commanding or taking out tanks, clearing buildings, withstanding artillery barages, cowering in trenches, and capturing points of strategic importance is all of what this game is about.   You have a variety of classes to choose from each game, but you will not nessecarily get the one you want. Like in real war, there are only a few machine-gunners, snipers, demo-men, and officers. RO2/RS makes this reality by limiting the slots availible for certain classes of soldier, which means most of the time, that bolt-action piece of junk is your best friend. And you will appreciate its range and accuracy, which are still unmatched by the so-called 'better' weapons (like SMGs, MGs, Pistols, Automatic Rifles, etc.) Plus, you only get the weapons that your chosen nation used in that theate of war. In Rising Storm, this gives the Americans a certain advantage weaponry-wise, but it is countered by the special abilities of the Japanese, which include portable mortars, booby traps, and the most effective bayonet-attack of all nations: the dreaded Banzai charge (which is surprisingly effective, don't knock on it 'till you've tried it)!  Hours of fun and excitement await you if you purhcase this game. I recommend getting the verison that is RO2/RS. You only get multiplayer, but the game still comes with training missions, and besides, you are really getting a whole extra game with RS. More maps, guns, and fun.  That being said, there are a few problems with Red Orchestra 2 that I have to discuss, in order for this to be a fair review: -1) Victory often goes to those with the best graphics. If your computer can't handle some of the most acturate physics and graphics, then don't bother getting this game. -2) It almost never lags or glitches, but when it does, boy, hold on to your ♥♥♥♥ing hat. -3) The community of players is generally rude and unforgiving, but you will find certain pleasent folks if you play enough. But the game has a steep learning curve that can be hard to overcome thanks to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that lurk around every corner. -4) The upgrade system for weapons is not at it's best, I'm not sure exactly how to deescribe it... -5) Soldiers in RO2/RS throw grenades liles ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Yes, you can't throw across the map like in COD, but jeez, they can never throw more than three strides away from them, and that's just too damn close for reality or comfort. -6) This isn't a problem for me, but many people have trouble identifying opponents in hardcore mode. This reults in lots of TKs, which occur all the time and everyone is in denial about. You are guarenteed to TK a bunch, I do it too, everyone does it.  None of the afore-mentioned problems outweight the glory and wonder that is Red Orchestra 2, though. And because this is a WWII based game and not a more modern war, you get to focus less on the problems (and infinately more bullets) around you and deal with yourself and your teammates and enemies one-on-one a lot more. If you like shooters, and you like realistic, then this is the single best game you could possibly buy. I guarentee it.  Red Orchestra2/Rising Storm gets a whopping 9 out of 10.",

When a new player steps in, he most likely gets obliterated over and over again. Death preys all around you, and quick deaths are reality for careless soldiers. However, when you finally find youself in other side of ironsights, you will find pleasure that recovers all deaths you gone through. Every kill feels rewarding and well-earned.   You can kill everyone with one single bullet from any weapon (not just headshot!), sometimes you can hit enemy to stomach, and he starts bleed to death. His sight is getting weaker quickly over time, but you better find cover fast, since he can still try to get his revenge on you!   Weapon handling feels good, you are not aiming directly to center of the screen, which results in harder hipfiring. Weapons do have really high recoil, but difference to other mainstream military FPS', weapons are really accurate. How frustrating is it to aim directly at your enemy, but bullets spread all around him? Wont happen in this game.  Do you like tanks? In this game, you will spawn inside a tank, but you are not a tank itself. If you zoom out, you can see your arms and legs, and you can look around interiors of your tank. Tanks also have location specific damage system, not overall health bar (like in Battlefield). Single accurate shot from AT rifle to ammo supplies will blow up the tank, but you can waste all your ammunition while firing strong frontal plates. Unless you have a tank yourself, satchel charges, AT grenades or -rifle, you will not do any harm to enemy armour.  You want highly realistic gameplay?

It's a challenging game, though it has a lack of new experience. It will hardly surprise you after 20 hours of play, and you'll spend 60+ hours just to become a good player. 78 out of 100.",

There is no bullet drop as far as i can see but there is bullet time and penetration. If you die its all on you because if you dont know what cover to use in the right time you are going to pretty much be shot dead before you know it.

This is the perfect game for anyone that was a fan of Katamari. The gameplay is very similar in some ways. This is basically the video game version of the movie Casablanca which is why it is so good. My only complaint about this game is the graphics. The visuals look too good and I always get 60 frames which is too much for me. I prefer a buttery smooth 17-30 frames a second and at HD resolutions of 792p but no higher than that. 1080p is useless as the human eye can distinguish anything above 792p. Anyway, Red Orchestra 2 is the best MOBA on the market and I highly recommend it to anyone that liked Sleeping Dogs.",

The boot camp wasn't challenging at all and each weapon station didn't give you enough time to get a feel for the various weapons available in the game. (The first boot camp I ever played via the first Medal of Honor was better); however on starting the campain proper I was really pleased to find this was a very well made game. It's not Call of Duty, but there was somthing about the game mechanics that drew me in. Weapons are fairly basic, my favorite being the sniper rifle.  If you love run and gun games this isn't for you. You need to use cover sensibly as often as possible or you'll keep dying. When you die you take over one of your squad mates (in singleplayer). It was well worth the full price I paid for it.   Looking forwards to some community based mods for this game.",

            "review_text": "(Rising Storm is natually included with this review)  Most people here probably have played a FPS before, but ask yourself the following question:  '' Have I ever played a FPS wherein war wasn't glorified in an ''America saves the world'' story?'' '' Have I ever played a FPS where war is as hellish as it can be as it was in reality?''  The answer would be for most of you no, and this is where Red Orchesta 2 / Rising Storm comes in. Forget the modern FPS cliche shooters wherein you suck on your thumb behind a wall after getting hit and get strawberry jam to indicate that you are hurt and need to cry against a wall for a few seconds before jumping back into the fight with your laser-accuracy guns if you just press the button to aim down your sight. If you play with this mindset, Red Orchesta 2 / Rising Storm will personally kick your nads through your nose before calling you a massive wimp.  RO2 / RS doesn't mess around with getting serious. Not if, but when you get hit with a bullet, you will either be dead after tumbling over the floor, bleed a lot and patch yourself up with a bandage if you happened to be lucky and having dragged yourself to a safe position without getting turned into Swiss Cheese by more bullets. You get two bandages, but you will probably be dead before you get the chance to apply a second, as getting shot in a place will mean that the next hit there will probably be fatal. No bandages left, or you got shot and didn't topple over instantly? Have fun bleeding out while your soldier splurts out his last sounds in a performance which could have easily fit into Band of Brothers or The Pacific or Saving Private Ryan or other movies reminding you of the harsh reality of war. Have I mentioned yet that war is hell? This game makes artillery incredebly terrifying, as in ''Oh lord, don't let me die so horribly''. It is not like in normal FPS'es where you just slump over or get ragdolled into a silly way, you will end up into a muliated bunch of flesh or just into red mist. And given how long the arty can last, it is incredebly tense all the while.  Continuing with the setting, it is World War II. RO2 finds place in Russia, the area around Stalingrad of course, as it is the decisive Battle of Stalingrad. Whereas Rising Storm takes place in the Pacific, as the Americans came closer and closer towards Japan. Most of the maps are thus as close to what it was in reality, with famous locales being also as close as they were. A quick batch of examples are Pavlov's House, Grain Elevator and Stalingrad Station for RO2, and Peleliu Airport and Saipan from Rising Storm. Thereby comes that there is a distinct variety in the maps, as none of the maps feel the same.  There are maps which take place in a small ruined city block, prompting for some heavy short-range combat, maps where it is pure trench warfare, maps wherein the attacking team has to fight itself up an enemy stronghold, such as the Grain Elevator and Iwo Jima. Maps can be relatively small-scale with close combat, or they can be large, kilometres long battlefields, where a team needs to push the other all the way back. Every map is accomedated for 64 players though. The larger maps, in RO2, also have tanks (and armed personnel carriers being released shortly), which are a whole new beast to tame for players. Controlling one has to be done in a crew, and taking one down is not an easy task. They are one of the uniquer parts of the multiplayer experience, as not everyone gets to take one out. There are specific classes who are effective against them, like the Anti-Tank Soldier (carries an Semi-auto rifle with a caliber to literally gib other players), and the Engineer (Can drop extremely heavy explosives used to destroy tanks or certain obstacles hindering their team.)   Speaking of which, the class system. It is pretty much a system of one common class and the specialists and team leaders. Most people have to play Rifleman, and as this is the Second World War, there are no full-auto rifles for everyone, so the majority has to do with a classic Bolt-Action rifle and two grenades, and maybe a pistol if you earned one. Don't fret over not getting something flashy; The Bolt-Action rifles, such as the Moisin-Nagant M1897 and the Arisaka Type 38 are frightenly accurate at long range once you get used to bullet drop, and they are strong enough to drop almost everyone with a well placed shot in a vital part. The specialist roster gets made up by Elite Riflemen, using Semi-auto's. Assault gets the SMG's from that time, as assault rifles as most FPS'es have didn't exist then, except for the rare German MkB42. Weapons that fire faster are nowhere as close with accuracy as Bolt-Actions after a few shots though. Then there are more specialists, like the Machine Gunner, which need something to lean their massive machine gun on, but are in the hands of a good player the backbone of the team. And as last, the Sniper, which has a limit of two per team, (take that TF2 servers) and should be in the back most of the time.  Rising Storm has a few exclusive classes for that theater of war, such as the US-exclusive Flamethrower, which does exactly what it says, and has fairly realistic physics, such as fire bouncing off walls and the damn thing actually having a dangerous range, which makes it a horrible experience to die against due to the really agonising death screams this game offers. The Japanese get the Light Mortar Class, which is basically a Grenade Launcher class, which is incredebly deadly, but also very slow with firing, and should stick towards the back. Lastly, we have the team leading classes, the Squad Leaders and the Commander. The Squad Leaders are pretty much the captains of their part of the team, and basically act as an living mobile spawn point too if they kicked the bucket, but not the SL. It beats walking to the battle for a minute or so. That does not mean the SL should just hide all the time, he pretty much needs to get as close as possible to the battle and lead his squad.  They also have to set artillery marks for the Commander to be of as much use as possible too. The Commander is basically the Team Captain, and should coordinate his team accordingly. Stay in contact with the team as much as possible, communicate with the SLs as much as possible, and make good use of calling in recon and artillery. They can stay all the way in the back, but it is overall better to be near your team on the points. Artillery is a vital tool in attacking and defending, so don't let your team down by doing literally nothing. Don't take it until you have read up on it and you think you can do it when nobody is taking the job.  This all sums up in an incredebly tense FPS, with a heavy dose in teamwork which I miss in other FPS'es. Holding the other army off a vital point in the defense with your team, or going into the attack with a full team of 32 others gives a rush not too many other multiplayer games can achieve on such a scale. Seeing everything going as planned as a team is something which is pure joy. Although that doesn't happen every round, there is generally a good dose of teamwork. Add to it that this game is really immersive, and you have one of the best multiplayer FPS games of the last five years.  I now realize that I have maybe made this review a bit too long (It is about twice, or thrice as long as my Fallout: New Vegas review now I look at it.) , but hopefully I have informed whoever is reading this well on Red Orchesta 2 / Rising Storm.  Don't let the doomsayers saying that the game is dead to your head, it is still active, with a constant 2000 players at the moment of writing, which is not even one of the peak hours.  Furthermore, the developers are still fully supporting this game, and there are still new maps, weapons and even vehicles coming. There is also a Vietnam mod, In Country, coming out for it eventually. So stay tuned for more, and have fun!",

            "review_text": "RO 2 is overall good. Its an old game so graphics are a bit dated ,some bugs and not enough players hinder the overall enjoyment . Very realistic gameplay , belly crawl to cover, peek out take a shot , can be very frustrating at times when fighting against veterans that have been playing for several years and know the best spots to camp and have leveled up all classes and weapons also . My biggest complaint is spy planes and tanks ( i dont like getting spotted and appearing on enemy radar ....that just feels too much like COD or Battlefield and is really out of place for this type of game) (and tanks IMO are a bit OP especially the Russian tank mainly because your only two ways of taking it out are an anti tank rifle and anti tank grenade , but the good tank players will sit way back ,which is out of bounds for you so you cant grenade it ,and position themselve where a anti tank rifle cant hit their weak points .) but overall if your patient and enjoy a slow and well balanced more realistic shooter than this is for you .  Rising Storm is in my opinion great , better graphics because it was a stand alone DLC created a couple of years ago. steep learning curve also, but in my opinion a bit easier to get into. Level design is better for new players ,these maps have way more cover which makes for easier flanking for tactical players. but just like RO 2 it has some annoying bugs and not enough players , hinder the enjoyment factor (not enough servers for this game ,RO 2 is by far more popular) same gameplay as RO 2 , but a couple of weapons feel a bit cheap ( flamers and knee mortars are cheap but a great equalizer for new players ) . No tanks in this DLC ,which i prefer , and since there is so much cover you can get away with more of a run and gun gameplay , but there are choke points where you have to have good Squad leaders and a team leader that use smoke effectively and set good artillery spots , to clear out pesky defenders. Accurate period historic weapons make this game a bit unbalanced for the Japenese , but a good Jap team can woop the Americans no problem , the worst most one sided map is Maggot Hill , and is terrible map design ,but can be defended with good tactics and communication. Overall a Great game for patient tactical players.  And finally this new MOD called Western Front (created by players and fans of this game )it is some of the finest map design i have ever seen ( please TripWire hire these guys for the next game ) , just all around great , but unfortunately this mod is barely played and only 2 servers are playing this mod that i have seen , one is in the states and is usually empty when i am on, and the European server is playing this mod is sometimes full or half full , (but European servers are a bit too laggy for me in the states ). so i unfortuantely have not played this one very much , but i really like what i saw ... i do recommend this version , but the graphics are the worst out of these three game's which i think is why its is the least popular. overall great game for patient tactical players .   I really hope Tripwire starts making this Series for Consoles , i think it would create a huge player base ,and would boost sales and eventually TripWire interactive would be Huge !!!! and realistic games would make a comeback on consoles !!!  see you on the battlefield !!!!!",

You cant play this successfully by running and gunning, and lone-wolfing around the maps. This is a team based game, where the success of your team is based on the cohesiveness of your team. If you work together the odds of winning are greater and the more fun you will have.   This game can have some pretty EPIC battles, especially when two experienced and insync teams go head to head. There is nothing more cool than holding the line against all odds, while dozens of enemy troops are charging your position.   This game may be old, but you know what they say....Old is Gold.

            "review_text": "Well, I have had this game for a long time now.   I have to be honest, I didn't like it when I first started out, it does have a very step learning curve, if you are not used to realistic shooters. But if you stick at it, and listen to your TLs and SLs, then you will soon love the game.   Yes, you die a lot at first, as the damage model is very high, it usually takes 1 hit to kill you with bolt actions, but sometimes you can get lucky and only get nipped or 'Bleed Out', which basically means you have to bandage yourself our you will die, depending on where you are hit.   It is good idea to get used to all of the roles, as you might have to take them up. If you're an TL, you will have to communicate with your team, have to tell where to go and what to do. You will have to give good artillery. And for the love of god, don't put artillery in front of the caps and get all of your team killed.   If you're an SL, you need to be a spawn point for your squad, so basically try not to die to much, you will also be responsible for providing smoke to cover your advance. And also you will need to give artillery marks for you TL to call in artillery.   If you're an Engineer, then you will have to blow up objectives in the game, this could be actual objectives you will need to destroy with satchels, or it could be tank traps, so the you can help the tank to move up, its very frustrating when Engineers don't do their job properly as it CAN stop your team from winning the game.  Yes, there is still some bugs with the game, for example if you are on a map that involves tanks, for example 'Rakowice' and if your reinforcements have ran out, you sometimes get a bug that your tickets are at -1, this means that even if you killed all of the enemies, you won't finish the game, it will only finish if you cap the objectives or wait until the time runs out. And you can only with if you are the attackers with this bug.   All in all, this is a amazing game, it WILL take to time to get used, and it will get better. But its the only suitable realisic WW2 Shooter out there at the moment, and for being a relatively oldish game, it does have a large player base, still palying the game.   8/10.",

The wounding system is also very interesting, nothing gets the adrenaline flowing quite like crawling for cover to patch up your wounds before you bleed to death.  The only issue I have with this game is that there is no SP campaign. It's a real shame that a game with such an amazing gameplay doesn't offer the possibility to get a realistic feel of what WW2 was like. There is a bad attemt at SP though, in which you play MP style battles against bots.

Steep learning curve for this game as there are a lot of small commands that help and a lot of re-learning each weapon you unlock.   Things to be ready for as a new player: Don't be intimidated by players who rack up 100 kills on a map. They are not hacking. They are just good.  Steep learning curve. You will not have all weapons unlocked at the start. Don't worry you will get them.  Tips: Join a 60/60 server with green ping. You may have to wait for a seat, but it's better than a garbage server with kids. Never play on a server with bots if you can help it.   Drawbacks to avoid: The biggest issue with this game is new players complaining or team wounding/team killing. Find a known server and do not play modded servers.",

Maps were redisigned to create bottlenecks, no more deep flanking possible.  2. In compare to release battles are very short and usually one-sided. The maps, that usually took up to an hour or even more to resolve, now takes 10-15 minutes at most. There are just not enough spawn points to keep going.  3. The rising storm adition is even more close combat oriented with maps design to create bottlenecks where granade\\mortar\\flamethrower spam is a key tactic. 4. Before we had 2 tanks for each side on most maps, now 1 is max, also on some maps only one side have a tank.  5. Players are devided into two categories - the one who knows how to play with the graphics and the others.  It is possible to do things like:  Ability to see through the smoke, remove grass and most of the trees and bushes, also remove some other objects which can be used for cover, in addition to that it is possible to adjust gamma brightess and other lighning effects in a way that enemy soldiers will literally glow and will be perfectly visible. Also it is possible to do some more adjusments and then you can (in some cases) see through the walls too.  Why am I so confident about that? Because I do it myself since release. Exactly same thing was in red orchestra 1.  It is so called legal cheating cause you just adjust graphics settings. Only config.ini, console commands and game settings.  So gameplay is like this - take MG, go to your favorite spot, kill people, ressuply and repeat the process. You can take tank or sniper too, other classes just make it slightly harder.  Enemy will be perfectly visible and for them you will be hidden in a grass or other obstruction. the only ones that can kill you are other graphic adjusters (there are plenty).  Its a lot of fun.  So once again - in this game you can play in two ways: 1. With pretty graphics, shadows. trees etc... and die a lot. 2. Your game will look like red orchestra 1 on a lowest settings and look familiar to moon landscape, but you will kill people.  So graphics or frags Cant get both in this game",

It provides you with a real war experience that it is fun yet challenging. The graphics is quite nice (for a 2011 game).  However, the AI in this game is bad. In SP, you get to be the commander to direct your troops to certain spots. Sometimes they listen, but most of the time they don't (often occurs in small enclosed areas). Their cover positions aren't really good, and yet they defy orders. The upside is that this not only applies to your ally; the enemies at some missions are pretty stupid. Yet this will result in you getting stuck at one mission as your checkpoints get overwhelmed easily.   Another thing to note is optimisation. This game stutters too much. I've played many missions where the game just lags out of nowhere. I tried turning off all background programs and even tried on a newly formatted PC, but to no avail. I'm not sure why but when I play other AAA games like Metro franchise, the game doesn't lag.   My specs are:  i5-4570 8GB RAM AMD R9 290 Windows 7 (with the latest updates) ... *other not-so-related-to-lags parts* ...  Key bindings can be quite a problem. I don't blame the dev because there are too many commands (for realism). BUT those tutorials that teach you how to operate tanks and use commands? Those are problems -- when you change your key bindings, the in-game key binding messages doesn't change. You will need to set it back to default and change all over again before you start a mission.  I have never tried multiplayer before so I'm not too sure about the online experience. Maybe this game might be worth getting for its online content but don't get it if you just want to play SP missions. You'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and eventually delete the game for good.",

Call of Duty United Offensive had MUCH better player movement that was smooth and you actually survived more than 30 seconds. Many maps you get killed without even seeing the enemy.

            "review_text": "Now dont get me wrong i love this game but the utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that i am continuously experiencing has ruined the game experience, first of lets start in the single player campain the first problem is the ammount of time it takes for your squad just kills it. unless you are on the lowest difficulty you will find yourself restarting at checkpoint millions MILLIONS of times because your damn squad AI and its even worst if your defending, the timer on when reinforcements arrive it could be exactly the same ammount of time it takes to defend a objective so unless you are god and can withstand the enemy AI just overwelm your force you are going to once again be clicking that restart button until your fingers go nub. Another problem is that the Enemy AI doesnt make any sense they just do the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again even though its going to most likely annihlate them for example when you defend spartanovca or what ever its ♥♥♥♥ing called as the germans the russians are litterally running in the same patter, its no different than if they just stood in a straight line marching at me. not to mention that they spawn way to fast so if your defending a open area or something like that once again you will be overwelmed and killed being force to mash the ♥♥♥♥ out of your restart option.  The only other problem i have in single player is that ammo runs out way to fast, for example you might fire a machine gun in small simple burst but every few seconds you run out of ammo and it gets annoying expecially when you get overwelmed. In Multiplayer i like a majority of it but its extremely laggy sometimes and it just too hard to see enemy soldiers even if there right infront of your face on a couple maps.",

They've made it so that in order to be a 'ranked' server as they put it, you have to be a business.  Of course, the people still supporting this game are what those of us 'in the know' collectively refer to as the 'fanboys'. They're Reddit jockies and so on. Jerks, illiterate, hateful and champions of stupidity itself. I myself even tried to speak to some of these people but they are so fanatic, I honestly wonder if they're not just employees of Tripwire out on the web supporting their regime of greed.",

You cannot, and likely will not find a server that is under 100ms ping, and its very evident. Even when you do, you'll encounter spikes and fits of lag which eventually leads to your session ban.

Tank combat is a gimped slugfest in tiny envioronments relying on dicerolls and your tank not being immobilized for the entire round.

The graphical effects and sounds are perfectly implemented to set the mood and theme of a World War II simulation, grabbing the player's full attention in immersive and tense scenarios. All of the official maps are also beautifully crafted, with much attention to detail, including good quality textures and tactical environments. Since this is a multiplayer only game, that is where it all starts falling apart. Firstly, the developers opted to use the archaic, erroneous, and intrusive PunkBuster anti-cheat service in the game. Not only is it extremely innacurate and unreliable, it also requires its own separate installation onto your system; which means it will force itself to run in the background, in addition to the game client. Secondly, the server browser and in-game pings differ by at least 30 or 40, every time. In other words, the ping being shown in the server browser is always at least 30 or 40 lower than what it actually is in-game. This is a problem that has been reported in both the Steam and official game forums for a long while, without any response by the developers. Thirdly, even though there is an average of 1276 concurrent players in the last 30 days at the time of this writing, finding a populated server with a tolerable ping is not easy. The few servers available with a playable ping (100 or less) have the low artificial intelligence bots taking place of the absent human players, which brings down the game's fun factor to an unbearably low level. In addition to the lack of active servers, when there are people playing on a full server, many player pings are in the 200s, and some in the 300s. What could have been a great, engrossing, realistic experience ends up being marred by all of its technical online problems. While one may find adequate multiplayer conditions to play the game properly from time to time, I have found that this happens very rarely. What you will find are high ping servers with a small human population and a high bot population, with the occasional populated high ping server with human players whose pings are well into the 100s, 200s, and even 300s. A multiplayer only game should never be played in those conditions. If you are able to find a good server with people playing, there are many fun and fulfilling hours to be had. Too bad these ideal conditions are few and far between.  Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer is mediocre.",

I like knowing where I am going.   The lack of a spotting feature and drab, bland, below-average poorly textured graphics hide soldiers very well. Combine that with the all teh weapons which are basically 1 hit kill and it allows stackers/hackers to camp/spawn camp the sht out of you. I abhor rubber bullet games like Quake Wars which permit aimbots and stackers to steamroll but there has to be a balance.   There is no freedom of class as they are all limited via a maximum cap so the good classes like sniper are usually always taken. The classes/roles are also basically carbon-copies of each other with weapons/equipment varying little.   The animation is clunky and average at best. The weapon sounds, while I am not disputing their realism or lack thereof, are lacking in bass and volume and are dull and boring.  The low quality does permit large scale battles of 64 players which can be nice. However, the maps are basically rectangular chokepoints made for defenders to farm.

            "review_text": "Be very careful when deciding whether or not you should buy this game. I’ve purchased it and found it to be a massive let-down. The game has a distinct lack of features, is very difficult to learn, and is a very frustrating game to play.  The game extremely confusing to play; upon joining a server for the first time, I found it impossible to find any enemies. I searched the map for at least 15 minutes before being taken out by a sniper in the distance. Upon re-spawning, I didn’t have any issues finding enemies; however, I did have issues killing them. Every time I ran towards the enemy lines, I would just get gunned down every time. This was a very frustrating experience; because I am used to other similar games (such as Call of Duty) I was using the normal tactic commonly found in COD. This, for whatever reason, is not effective in Red Orchestra 2, and instead you must camp and wait for enemies to come into your line of sight. The most frowned upon “tactic” used in Call of Duty is the only valid tactic in Red Orchestra 2. In my opinion, that is just due to lazy game design.  Something else which I found to be extremely stupid is that not everyone can have access to an automatic weapon. Instead, most players on the server are forced to use a bolt action rifle against their will. This is not only a bad game design choice (since we are forced to use a weapon that we might not want to use), but it also doesn’t make any sense from a realistic point of view. If both sides had access to automatic weapons, wouldn’t they arm all of their soldiers with them? Doesn’t make any sense to use the out-dated weaponry.  I also was disappointed to find that this game is set in the olden days. I find that modern warfare is much more exciting, strategic and enjoyable to play. There are a larger variety of weapons to choose from, alongside a diverse range of vehicles to choose from. I think that the game should have implemented both “olden day” and “modern day” game modes, at least in doing this there would be some variety in the game.  My final point is regarding the kill feed. There seems to be a glitch with the kill feed, in the sense that there is a delay between getting a kill and the kill appearing on the kill feed. In superior titles (such as COD), the kill feed can be used as a means of checking to see if the enemy is dead. For example, if an enemy is in the distance, you can fire a few rounds at the enemy, and then simply check the kill feed to see if they are dead. In Red Orchestra 2, the enemy will often lie down after being shot at. It then becomes very difficult to tell if you have killed the enemy or not, which is often misleading. Fixing the kill feed bug will fix this issue, but the devs do not seem interested in fixing it.  Whatever you do, stay away from Red Orchestra 2. It’s nowhere near as good as others are saying it is. There are a magnitude of poor design decisions which have made this game unplayable. Avoid!",

The soundscape is excellent. Weapons sound very realistic, whether near, far, or inside a building. Weapon handling (accuracy etc) are still the best I have ever seen in any game (much better than ARMA series in my opinion). There are some neat gameplay mechanics that simulate suppression, and reward teamwork and discourage camper score-whoring. This is probably the only game that really models suppression. Don't bother with the single-player though, its rubbish and the AI is dumb.  When it was released back in 2011, it was rough around the edges with lots of bugs, but now in 2014, with continuous support from the devs, virtually all the problems have been ironed out, and it now runs very stable.  Being realistic and brutal, this is very unforgiving to noobs (and CoD players). Only 1 rifle bullet is needed to kill. Noobs spawn, run forward, and get killed by enemy artillery, or a tank 300m away, or a sniper 200m away, or a machine gunner 150m away, or a maxed out assault trooper 5m away, and never see it coming. Being realistic, machine guns are almost just as accurate as sniper rifles, but it is slightly harder to spot prone enemies without the scope. I am usually the machine gunner, and by a round's end (20min) I may have killed over 80 of them and only died 5 times. That's how ruthless this game is. This is arguably both the game's biggest strengh, and its biggest problem.  This game uses a leveling and unlock system, but it is still quite fair on new players. While fully levelled guns will help (with slightly reduced weapon sway, recoil, reload time, magazine size etc) it is still only 20% of your effectiveness and the remaining 80% is down to your tactical awareness, teamwork, and most of all, your individual skill. That is the most important thing. If you are naturally good, you will start out quite well and only get better as you level up, but if you are not so good at aiming with a mouse, you might always struggle.  The online community is more mature than in most other shooter games. We still get the occasional 12 year old, but not too often. As of Dec-2014 there are still a good range of servers and a good volume of players online (about 1500 sunday night, 300 monday morning). At peak times there are about 5-10 servers with 64 players, and some servers occasionally go over the 64 player limit. The most I have seen is 85, that was epic. In 800 hours of gameplay I have only seen 1 incident of hacking (the artillery hack), and that one was patched out by the devs within days. So, this game has a virtually hack-free environment.  So, this game is too brutal and realistic for many, but if CoD or Battlefield is not cutting it for you, I recommend you try this.",

RO2 has a steep learning curve when compared to most fps. If you can see your enemy, he can see you, if you can't see him, he can still see you, if you're behind cover, he can see you, if you just spawned, he can see you, if you're behind him, he can see you. And he will kill you. He will kill you a lot. You will be spawn killed when spawning off your squad leader. You will see a sniper rifle on the ground, and you will spam the pick up key. The pick up key will only work 1/3 of the time. A grenade will land near you and you will spam the prone key. This key will work 3/4 of the time. You will wrestle with the controls as much as you fight your enemy. You will be team killed by free weekenders and people who bought this game on sale. When playing as the americans in RS, you will die 2/3 of the time by aimbotting heatseeking knee mortar nukes, and have your character do an automatic 180 spin to expose his back during a banzi charge. When playing as the russians you will be destroyed by the german's superior machineguns. As the Japanese you will be dominated by the M1 Garand and the flamethrower. As the Germans the russian smg's will cut through you like swiss cheese and their inferior MGs will still give you a run for your money. When you try to join a match with ~3 open player slots, the map will load and only after the map has loaded will you be kicked back to the server browser with the server full message. this happens 1/2 the time. If you are however willing to learn the game and put up with a lot of the stupid stuff that happens way too frequently, this game is EXTREMELY fun. Very tense, very satisfying to do well in. It captures war in a way that few games can, and has lots of small details that add so much to the game. One notable one is the game's unique bolt action mechanic, where, if you choose to turn it on, you have to manually cycle the bolt of the rifle. There are lots of times where you can have awesome Alamo style last stands, as well as adrenaline fueled assaults. Put time into this game. learn from veterans. keep your head down.

I get accused enough of this by the server and get session banned (meaning get banned from the session until map change) which is extremely annoying because I want to play a long, full, tactical match but, no I can't I just get session banned. Then there's Punkbuster. It's so annoying because if I wanted to go on a server and play it kicks me out immediatley. I really hope this game does get fixed and Punkbuster is gone.

Well, this game is what you need. There have been many times that I will always remember in this game. Like this time when me and my squad were running through smoke after being pinned down my an MG42 for about 10 minutes. Someone said that it was 'all clear'. We began to advance down a slope with smoke surrounding us. There was silence, the only noises were our feet hitting the floor. But then, I heard someone next to me say 'Wait! The MG is still.....'. Then a hail of MG fire ripped through the smoke. I dived to the floor. As I looked up, three of my squad members were cut down and one of their helmets rolled towards me. I cowered in a fox hole and began to throw grenades over. It all went slient. I was then that I realised that I was the sole survivor of the suprise attack. I was too scared to stand up. Then I heard footsteps coming my way. Then there he was. A German infantry soldier sprinting towards me with his bayonet at the ready. I managed to shoot him in the leg, but by then it was too late. He embeded the bayonet deep into my chest. As I fell to the floor, I saw the rest of my team, all laying there motionless with their weapons laying by their side. My squad's death was the start of a 1 hour and 30 minute intense, amazing and emotional battle.",

One of the most realistic shooters you'll find as well. Plus, you can pilot vehicles when playing the proper class, which I've never even done (it's pretty complicated). There's a lot I've yet to experience in this game. A few facts about this game:  -You're going to die. A LOT. -You're going to miss your intended target. A LOT. -You're going to be blown up by artillery or grenades. A LOT. -You will get shot and slowly bleed to death. A LOT. -You will shoot your teammates by accident. A LOT.  Here's some tips that I've done on how to avoid any of that:  -Take your time! Think about where you're going to move. Strategize. This isn't f**king Call of Duty, or Battlefield. -Be aware of your surroundings. People hide just about anywhere, and all it takes is one well placed shot for you to be killed. -Stick as close to cover as you can, at all times. Never be out in the open. If any time you can be inside a structure, GO. -Grenades, grenades, grenades! -Bullet drop is a mechanic, keep that in mind when engaging long distance. -Bolt action VS. machine guns in CQB generally won't turn out in your favor. Always try to have the upper hand. Stealth CAN be used if you're smart. -Be sure of your target before firing! This game has friendly fire.  -Don't be a ♥♥♥♥. Always apologize on chat if you TK. Killed teammates can 'forgive' you, and you'll get your points back.   Buy this. Have you bought it yet? No? You will...trust me.",

You have two different launchers both of which have the most excrutiatingly long-winded titles that look awful in your steam library. Where as before it was just Red Orchestra 2, heroes of stalingrad. That was it.The menu was changed to a more Japenese theme, it was as if the DLC took over the whole game. Maybe Tripwire was trying to shift the focus from Nazi Germany and the fact that this is one of the only first person shooter titles where you can actually play as the Germans in the campaign. The single player campaign itself, unfortunately, was totally hashed on it seems,and foprgotten, and never updated. Hell, I dont even think the achievements work. The core gameplay itself is wonderful, the multiplayer really is the only reason to own this game, which brings me to my next point, the amount of players nowadays and luck of actually finding a decent server? Slim to nil. Its a sad turnout , RO was and is such a unique game that many others have copied and borrowd mechanics from, Its sad to see it in such dire straights. My hope is that Tripwire find some time to have even a tiny update and another free weekend to get some people on these servers because it is no fun playing bots, and I aint joing weekend warriors or merrils maraurders just so I can reserver a friggen spot they can frigg right off.",

MG Gunners are also important, they have suppression factor which takes anybody on the other end of the barrel out of action, by outright killing them or making them so suppressed they can't aim. Definitely worth the money. Get it. You won't regret it.",

The iron sight rifles along with the rest of the guns have had a lot of thought put into them. The suppression system that includes fear based suppression brought on by many enemies charging is something different but really works well. The squad leader and commander classes give a new element to the battlefield with something to keep the more veteran players interested. Coupled with the tank and anti-tank classes for when you want to do some serious suppression however you have to really practice them especially when you're in a vehicle all by yourself. WWII has always been my favourite genre and this is definitely the best WWII game I've ever seen.",

Some Weapons get pretty cool updates, like the MP40 and the Kar98 but others get really nothing ar stuff that you wont see with the naked eye, like the DP28 (Was it 28?) which only gets cleaner metal. Its awesome to hear the native voices of each faction altough i like the english russian voices better than the russian. If you cant see anymore snow or bolsheviks (You did nazi that coming) you can just switch the Rising Storm, which really has a complete other playstyle and gunplay (Its pretty easy to sniper with the shotgun) even though Rising Storm has less cool upgrades for you weapons. I really like the suppression and morale system (take that Battlefield!) The Graphics arent topnotch anymore but for 2011 - Great! The animations still remain awesome - you ruck Tripwire Interactive! They could've used voice actors, hearing 4 nazis who speak in the same tone really gets annoying. I just pointed out a few points i like or dislike.  Tic Tac Tic Tac Fritz! 10/10.",

Hearing the screams of fallen allies as morters drop and bullets fly past your head. The gore in this game is pretty good as well, which is something needed for such a brutal period in history. You can lose legs, arms even your head from AT rifles, explosives, morters and operational tanks. While this game does have some issues, it is one of the coolest FPS games I've ever played.

Red Orchestra 2 is a game that is authentic in the historic detail of the game. The uniforms look great. It's one of the most tactical and hardcore game I have ever played, an example is one shot and your dead(just like real life). To compare with the orginal, there are some flaws with lack of vehicles, but Tripwire Interactive always promises to fix these flaws in the long run. I remember when the Game of the year edition was released. It fixed many bigs and solved many of the complaints it had , but they are still not done. As time progress, the game will get better because their vow of free content( as in its good content). In conclusion , I hope everyone buys this game and enjoy the great experience as I did.  Verdict : 9/10 + Authentic Detail +Great Core Features  - Lack of Vehicles in the Original  Updated: Still a good game.",

            "review_text": "To start off this review here is some background. I used to play and very much enjoy the first Red Orchestra and honestly was really excited for RO2 - when it was released I was unfortunately very dissapointed with the game. I knew the bugs would eventually be ironed out but it just felt different...smaller maps, no fluid controls, no tank maps at the start - little things that added up to being flawed game and I'm sure this wasn't experienced by just myself.   Now I've come back to it following the release of Rising Storm and I have to say through Tripwires hardwork and persistance the game is where it should have been in or around the release - the game has been jigged around, tweaked and smoothed to a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  I'll start off by saying the gameplay is relatively slow for a FPS, those of you that have played the predecessor will be used to this. The controls are fluid to suit the style of play with a good intuitive team communication feature to ensure the best possible teamwork out of essentially a game of up to 63 random people.   Aiming, shooting, gun mechanics etc. take a while getting used to but honestly are far easier and far more responsive than that of RO1; this may deter some hardcore sim enthusiasts but if you're looking for a competitive game then this suits perfectly.  Maps are smaller than RO1s, this does have it's pros and cons - pros being it suits competitive games more as you'll realistically not need so many players as the original game did to make a viable game. Cons are from a perspective of a single player really - large maps had a sense of immersion which is missing in RO2 and I hope to see some good community made maps turn up soon. The original had very large tank maps and I have to admit my experience in a tank on RO2 so fast has been extremely limited - however RO2 won't win any prizes if you're looking for a bigger better version of what RO1 did for the tank lover...honestly if you've never played RO1...well lets say it had one of the best tank simulations and this was purely a side part of the main game.  Whilst this review is blunt and to the point I urge anyone who is into FPS to try this, especially if you haven't tried an FPS sim before. They are relentlessly fustrating at the start as you get adjusted to the gameplay speed and die from places unknown in an instant, however it adds to the immersive gameplay, one that is rewarding, team based and skillful.",

You just ran across the open and now you're tired,you've entered a house to take cover and catch your breath when you hear some footsteps. A quick look at the map confirms there are no allies around,so you step into a corner and zoom in on the entrance nearest to the sound. You crouch down and hear the footsteps get closer. finally,you see the tip of a Mosin-Nagant. You're ready. The Russian fully enters the room and turns towards you. You fire. The bullet hits the Russian in his stomach,the shot is fatal,but he is not dead. He is bleeding out. The injury is too much for him to bandage himself,and all he can see is his screen fading to black. He panics and shoots. You have already clicked a second time to bolt your rifle,you   could   finish him off,but decide to save the extra round,and perhaps not risk being heard for sure. The Russian fires another round. He is bent forwards,his character clutching his stomach. It's rather quiet and you can hear the Russian calling for his mother before falling onto the ground,a blood pool forms around him. You reload your rifle,crouch down and get ready to exit the door he came through. You slowly peek out,check left and right before making a couple more steps into the open. You think it's all clea- *ping* You've just been shot in the head by an enemy you couldn't see. this isnt CoD or Battlefield,there are no killcams or special views showing your killer.

Though rising storm doesn't have its own campaign the multiplayer is fairly balanced. Though possible I haven't noticed a weapon balance difference like in RO2. Though both sides have advantages. The Japanese can do a bonzai charge similar to the Russian charge, giving them a bonus. As well as the ability to do grenade suicides with out penalties.

When you could describe the tone of a game by saying, 'It makes Battlefield 3 feel arcadey,' there's definitely a limit to the audience that the game will bring in. While Red Orchestra still has traits from games like the CoD series, things like loadout prestige, and close combat being determined by reaction time and lucky positioning, it definitely pioneered into the wilderness of realistic shooters. Where a normal shooter would give you directional damage markers, and kill-cams, Red Orchestra isn't afraid to kill players with a sniper shot to the heart. Or the pelvis. Or occasionally the calf, if you don't get a tourniquet on it swiftly enough. This devotion to how 'real' combat takes place shapes a sumpremely different game, with players focusing on creeping advances, hunkering down, and setting up fortified locations. Can be a great game if patience is in your skill tree, but otherwise, run-and-gun elsewhere.",

It's terrifying, tense, frequently brutal, realistic, at times hopeless and all around fun.  John Gibson, Tripwire president tried hard to keep the game realistic while also being easy to get into for people not used to such realism and it pays off, helping newbies to not struggle with controls so don't be amazingly afraid of RO2.   The game also has a great first person cover system, weapon mounting system, and even a nice damage system that makes every kill feel earned.   The maps for Heroes of Stalingrad and Rising storm give off experiences so different they're almost different games. Heroes of Stalingrad displays the struggle between the Soviet and German forces between 1941 to 1945, both equally matched albeit fighting on different sides with different weapons across large open, bleak colored battlefields on the snow covered bunkers of russia or the brick, dirt and concrete buildings and battlefields of germany, fights usually either at long range or extreme close range inside buildings.  Rising Storm however shows the Pacific Theatre of World War II, with the Japanese with their superior positioning and more brutally effective tactics (you can plant grenades in the ground like boobey traps and suicide rush for a bayonet stab) against the Americans with their generally superior weapons (You'll get to know the terror of the flamethrower well from the other end) albeit nowhere near the will to do the things the Japanese do, fighting across the tropical battlefields of japenese islands.   And the best part? If you own RO2 you can play Rising Storm's maps albeit stuck to a bolt action rifleman.",

But thanks to this game, I can stab American soldiers “to death” (wink) (wink) with my bayonet and feel super, duper happy, because I know that they’d simply respawn at a nearby flag! (so THAT’S what the flag on Iwo Jima was about!).  I also know now that WIKIPEDIA LIES! It claims that, during WWII, there were 22-25 million military deaths. What it SHOULD say is that there were 22-25 million military respawns! Silly internet!   So buy this game! Nobody plays it anymore.

This game should have more of a roleplay feel in my opinion. I hope tripwire thinks about the retreat and be shot thing, that'd be cool.   'One man gets a rifle with ammo, the other just gets ammo.

Graphics: you do need a decent graphics card, for instance the game runs fine on my low profile Radeon hd 5570 (60$ on newegg) and it does run just fine. textures are good and the enviroment can vary from windy and snowy to cold wet and muddy. gameplay: This game requires patience, The quickest way to describe it is, Whoever is the quickest aim with iron sigths (witch you do have to adjust for range) whoever can sneak around and acquire targets from the tinyest detail in pixels and adjust sights with the mouse wheel accordingly and aim at just the top of a steel pot in a window across the map and plink em' your KD wil go from 0-15 to 1-15 and that will be enough to keep you interested. this is the exact opposite from 'COD 360 no scope, ♥♥♥♥♥♥'. this is the closest you will get to real virtual combat.

It also manages to remain extremely entertaining whilst acheiving all of this. It is one of the few games where you actually feel as if your playing the choreographed trailer with its seemingly too amazing to be true moments. Whilst other games stage screenshots to entice you, RO2 allows you to actually participate in them as you duck into cover watching your comrade turn into a bleeding stump crying for his mother all the while a group of russians charging through smoke is mowed down by your squad mate. You watch in admiration as he changes his barrel and turn your attention to the Tiger providing support to the defensive hold. You watch in terror as a man runs behind the vehicle, turning it into a catastrophic explosion tossing shrapnel around. Again, another russian charge commences. Your squad mate is not saving you this time, you look at him hoping to see him take control again. He is looking right back at you motionless. You then see in the corner of the screen the cause of his apparent trigger control.   'Give me ammmo you ♥♥♥♥in noob.' Your eviscerated by a russian grenade. You respawn and realise its just a game again.",

And 1 hour was actually spent shooting at enemies.  Long story short, this game has done nothing but amaze me. If it were any other game I probably would have refunded it just because of the amount of bugs I've had but theres a certain masochist desire deep in my heart that kept drawing me back in. I've never seen another FPS do what RO2 has done, the developers have done an amazing job at capturing the feeling of pure terror and confusion of a battlefield. Its not clean and well lit like CoD but gritty and grey, the screen darkens when you're being shot at and half the time you can't tell if the guy in the trench across from you is Russian, German, or simply an agressive bush giving you the stink eye. Dirt and debris fly all around you, bullets ricochet off of walls and you watch in sheer terror as everyone around you is blown apart by artillary or shot down by machine gunners 100 meters away. Now take all of that and image some Russian guy across the globe yelling at you in broken english to run headlong in to everything.   This is Red Orchestra 2 and it is wonderful.",

For starters, this game is not only the most realistic World War 2 shooter I have played, but it's also by far the most entertaining. When I first purchased this game, I was actually very worried I would not like it due to the game revolving mostly around very large open maps, but because of the way these maps are created, whether you like it or not, you are forced to pay extremely careful attention to every angle that is around you, and once you adapt to the game, you'll find yourself spotting enemies in small hidden places that you never thought you would be able to see. Emphasis on teamwork is written all over the maps of this game, and even better, the community is excellent and very helpful.

Its not like Call of Duty as a lot of people will point out, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't rush in guns blazing, you just got to be careful. The game gets intense, and when playing with the right people, you'll find yourself having a real expirence. There's not a lot of trolling, the community is tiny, so you'll see regulars. The English are always a treat to play with. Bit of a learning curve; expect PTSD to set in around 10 mins.  Please use a mic, don't talk like a tacticool jackass, (ROGER ALPHA TANGO etc.) Use common sense, be brave and GET IN THE POINT!  If you have the patience, you'll have fun. I only play on 'Realism' because that seems to be where the most people are, and you get good fast. I also have the voice acting set to 'Native' so teams only talk in authentic Russain, German, Japanese - helps you really get into it.  If you like WW2, at all, I'd play this game. The Battle for Stalingrad was one of the bloodiest battles in human history, you get to see real locals from the first person (Grain Elevator, Pavlov's House, etc.)  Last piece of info, Russians tend to play for the USSR, snobby folks tend to play as Germans. And ♥♥♥♥ talking between Japanese and USA is godly. People really get into roll-playing in this game.  The game has bugs, it can crash, and does, I have fun regardless. Get it on sale, when its FIVE DOLLARS.",

When the OKW and USF were added to the game I was delighted that USF had been put in. Though after using them I realized who I was up against... The unstoppable power of the German army then when kitted out with fully auto MP40s and StG 44s along with the dreaded MG42 made it a living nightmare to play as either Russia or America in its unpatched state. I stopped playing after a while it was so bad, luckily you can get the relative same experience from Red Orchestra 2 but in a first person more team based view. Though I find it much more enjoyable to play as 1 man run into mg fire get cut down and try again, rather then see 3 entire sqauds run into mg fire get instantly pinned and completely annihilated by German autogun fire.

Using smoke to cover your movements and being incredible sneaky. 9.- Get killed from ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere. 10.- Repeat until you understand that war is hell. 11.- Free of your fears, with your comrades by your side, your beard grows, your voice get harsher and your clothes get dirtier. You start to actually listen to the SLs and TL and eventually, you don´t get killed from ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere so often. 12.- Once you are an experienced player, you tried another roles: eventually you lead your own squad, then the whole army, then you win a map, then the war. 13.- You get back to your farm, and alone, you stare in the eyes of your loyal goat Eduvigis, and share with her the one and only lesson that you learned: WAR. IS. HELL. Also, keep your head down, don´t throw smokes in your own lines and put the arty marks behind the capzones.  10/10. War is hell. Also fun.",
