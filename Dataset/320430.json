            "review_text": "I was very hesitant to purchase this due to the number of poor reviews. The handful of mediocre reviews plus the idea of playing without dealing with the card layout pushed me into buying. I was very surprised by how well it played after reading the reviews. I've played the physical game, but not the mobile versions. All in all, I've had no crashes and no difficulties with the interface after a few experimentations.   The tutorial teaches the game, but it does not do the greatest in illustrating how to interact with the game. One example is when choosing which construct to banish, it's unclear if the chosen card kept or banished. Some times the card can be dragged to the discard pile (or draw pile if that mechanic is appropriate). For the complaints about card readability, right-clicking on the card will present it front and center. Left-clicking will return to normal play. For the issue of menus not retracting (ie. opponent menu and 'discard from hand' menu), left-clicking on an open space on the menu or the discard pile, respectively, will return to normal play. Worst case, ESCape to the menu and select the 'return arrow' at the bottom left.  The game does not go full screen, but it does play at a decent resolution. For me, it's far from a deal breaker. The main improvement I could recommend is adding a more robust tutorial to cover the interface. The best part is, it's a minor technical limitation that can be overcome after a few matches.",

            "review_text": "Ascension the GAME is outstanding. The iOS version is an award winning classic that I play everyday. The Android version isn't quite as smooth but it's still a great game.   This PC port is total pants. I simply don't have the words for how sluggish, ugly, glitchy and slow it is. How could a company like Playdek that has made quality game after quality game on iOS actually release this steaming pile? I am appalled. The game runs at about 5FPS and is low rez and ugly. Sad. DO play the excellent physical card game, outstanding iOS or Andoid version but avoid this abomination of a PC port unless/until it is fixed.  UPDATE 12/22/15 After a year they have sorted out all the annoying bugs in the Steam client and it now runs smoothly. But it is still in absurdly low rez making it impossible to READ THE CARDS. Weird how a three year old cell phone has the horsepower to run this game in a native rez of 1080P and higher but my GeForce GTX980 equipped PC can't manage it. Please Playdek... it's nice that you gave us a couple of expansions free on PC that I bought on iOS and Android but why on earth can't you make a client that doesn't look like it it's running on a TRS-80? Still fail for Steam version, the mobile on iOS and Android (but NOT Amazon Kindles) is better than ever and still a daily played favorite.",

            "review_text": "The game mechanics are great and it's a fun game (on iOS or tabletop) but save your money and don't support crappy developers who churn out garbage like this.  I've got the game on iOS and it's a lot of fun. But I thought it would be even better on PC because it's sometimes difficult to read the cards on my phone.  So I purchased this on steam and loaded it up. It popped up in a little box in the middle of my screen and I thought that was just the publisher logo or something showing while it loaded. Then I realized that was the game. I figured I just needed to go in and tell the game I'm not using a 15' CRT monitor from the 90s. I went into the settings and discovered the game doesn't actually support widescreen monitors or a resolution above what I can only assume to be 1024x768 (at best). How are we in the year 2016 and we still have developers publishing games that don't support high resolutions and widescreen formats?  After about 8 minutes of trying to play this at its native resolution I closed the game, hopped on Steam, and submitted my refund request.  Please don't support garbage developers like this. This has been on Steam since 2014 it looks like and this issue still hasn't been resolved which tells me the company doesn't give a crap about supporting their product. They just wanted to make a few more bucks by doing a crappy job porting it from iOS. Definitely adding this company to my 'do not buy from' list.",

I know the base game is free on tablets, but it is important to note that this version does come with paid content from the 'Free' version. Not sure why they packaged it differently, but it is what it is. So far it's been a pretty addictive little filler, I have zero regrets in my purchase.",

The computer game here is a port of the iOS game, meaning that all of the intuitive tap motions are replaced with slightly awkward mouse movements. That's forgivable, but slow interaction, bugs, and irritating points where the mouse 'misses' cards make this a very poor adaptation of the game. I'm hoping that it will improve with later iterations; as it is now, I would definitely recommend against anyone purchasing it.",

Essentially it's a card game where you construct your deck as you play, using currency card to buy more powerful cards to shuffle into your deck.  As the game progresses you'll acquire and play more powerful cards (which I assure you is a vicious cycle, power begets power) and summon constructs, banish demons, and try to stop your opponents from buying more cards, killing more monsters and building a better deck than you.  It's extremely fun in my opinion, and there's a lot of great tutorials (including one in the game) on youtube and other places.   **** FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT DECK BUILDING GAMES ARE ****  Ascension Steam Edition has six expansions for free and all of the promos, giving you over 1000 cards to play with.  In short, it's amazing.",
