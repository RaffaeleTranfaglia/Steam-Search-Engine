I don't know where to start, I understand the game is old, but jesus christ, I spent hours looking for objects because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ art. But if I did find the object, it won't count as I was supposed to click on it from a certain angle. Too many locations to visit that I end up forgetting why I had to go there in the first place. Nothing interesting ever happens. So many bugs. Puzzles have the worst instructions ever. I have no words to express my boredom while playing this. I had to take breaks and took me 2 days to finish this it's so bad. But I still tried for the achievements, but guess what, broken achievements too. I wouldn't replay this if you pay me. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥!!!",

The “solving the mystery” part is so implausible all you do is discover things and make wildly outrageous assumptions to find the killer. This just kills the game for me, I can't get over the writing. I know I have slightly high standards (from playing visual novels which are about the story) for writing and that's not the point of this game but when the story is so bad and cliché that it actually takes away from the game you have a problem.   The puzzles are fine but nothing terribly hard and far too much running around IMO. Maybe one day II will find a truly hard HOG but I'm not expecting that any time soon.",

If you like mysteries and putting clues together to find out what's going on - this game will really be your cup of tea.  Just remember to play this one first and the Ravenwood second, I got them mixed up and played them in reverse. This one was fairly creepy and the second doesn't disappoint either. Make sure that you reserve a block of time to play as you can get caught up in the gameplay rather easily.  Both are top noche games although the second was even more gripping and compelling than the first. But don't think that this one is a cake walk either. This one has quite a few puzzles to solve that will have you stewing. Best put on your thinking cap for this one.   I'm enjoying the games that this bunch is putting out, so far they've yet to disappoint me. Take a chance, it's a great deal for some entertainment and mystery solving.",

The middle of the game was flat, while the beginning and ending had a lot to do.. One of the puzzles had me stumped for a good 45 minutes and it was rather frustrating.. There's not alot of direction - which - I'm not looking for an easy peasy game, but it got to the point where I had to look up a guide.. Story was cool though.. Graphics as always nice :)",

Storyline was a bit cheesy, like an old horror/detective movie, but it still played out very well. There were actually a few times this one startled me. I don't expect that in a simple hidden object game. I got this one in a bundle from Indie Gala, so of course for me it was definitely worth the price.",

I absolutely loved Enigmatis 2 so this was the obvious choice to play next. The hidden object puzzles are still good, the other puzzles were okay but I was not filled with the same excitement playing this game. Some elements of the story were a little spoiled by playing the latter game first and the animations in this are not as good. So this is still a good game just didn't quite live up to my expectations. Or the other way of looking at it is the series gets better from here.",

            "review_text": "The story of Enigmatis puts you in the shoes of a female detective investigating a case of a missing girl in the small town of Maple Creek. The game starts very near the end – with you running through a huge storm, fleeing from some unknown danger and losing your memory in the process. As the storm subsides, you find yourself on the outskirts of Maple Creek. Lost, alone, and with no recollection of what you were doing...   Enigmatis is a small, casual game, to be played in a few hours. Personally, I completed it in a little less than 4 hours. That said, it is a nice little hidden object game to pass time and indulge yourself for a bit. The pretty pictures and atmospheric sounds definately make it worth it to give this game a go.

            "review_text": "Over the course of the several hours spent playing, I developed a love/hate relationship with this game. I fortunately did not run into any of the game-breaking bugs that others have mentioned. I did have to use the hint button more times than I care to admit. It wasn't due to the game being difficult, however. It was more due to things like the aforementioned word choices for the hidden object portions. Some were downright misleading and I wondered many times if something was lost in translation (was this translated to english? I never did check...but it gave me that impression). Also, I too noticed that the 'hit box' for some objects was a bit off or small. Damn you, fur hat! Most of the puzzles were decent, except the sliding tile one. But that's a matter of personal hatred and not due to it being a bad puzzle. The graphical style was right up my alley. I loved it. It was like wandering around a dismal, eerie painting. The background music/noise was spot on, and especially creepy during the hidden object portions. The feeling of rummaging around someone's shed while someone creeps up behind you was very real. The story was better than I'd expected. A bit predictable, but still intriuging enough. There were times, though, I cursed the lack of common-sense logic. 'I need a fishing pole for that? Really? Are you serious? What was wrong with all the god-d----d sticks laying around everywhere?' I also came to utterly loathe the amount of back-tracking. Be prepared for that. Just take a deep breath and pretend the protagonist has suffered a nasty head injury. Which she probably has.   All in all, the combination of great art, chilling atmosphere, passable story and decent puzzles make it worth playing, despite moments that will make you glare at the screen in utter hatred.",

Having to click through more than 5 rooms / areas just to get a single item and then click another 5+ to go back to where it's needed, does not make it any smarter, only time consuming for no good reason. I usually enjoy Artifex Mundi games, but this particular one was the one that beat my patience levels and attention span.",

It's a shame, as 90% of the HO game translations are perfectly fine, but those odd few works are so wrong that when you can't find an object, you can never be quite sure if you are not looking hard enough, or if the dev has simply used a wrong word. I really wish they would sort this out, as it's on every single one of their games and it dampens an otherwise good experience. 6/10. Correct the english, and it would be an easy 8/10 in this genre.",
