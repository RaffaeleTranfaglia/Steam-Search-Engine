I like when familiar stories are reimagined, authors and creators give them they own flair and taste, and it worked in  Cinders . Story feels fresh, you can like (love would be strong term) and hate characters, and for 3 hours it grabs you and you want to see how the story ends. Happily ever after or miserable till death.  Art is simply fantastic, i am big fan of it.  Music could have been better.  There is nothing specific for what you can be harsh on this game and if you want me to cherry picking some stuff; I was surprised when i saw 16,99€ as a price for  Cinders . Holy cow! If i didn't get this game in bundle, i would never ever buy game like this, for price this high.  Awesome artwork, good storytelling were reasons to play till the end; but one end only.

            "review_text": "I originally had this game on my wishlist based on the art style alone. Turns out, it's a re-imagining of the tale of Cinderella. And it is a visual novel, where your choices have an actual impact on the story.   Graphics / art - 5/10  Let me get this out of the way since this is what first pulled me in. Mmmm ... not that impressive at the end of the day. Most of the characters look a little weird, and there's just not much animation. I know it's a visual novel, but it feels like they could have done a little more. So it's not bad, just not quite up to its potential in this area.   Story / characters - 8/10  The story itself is slightly adapted, and I have to say the developers did a great job. The wicked stepmother and the two evil stepsisters are actual characters with personalities, and through the story you can understand some of the reasons why they behave as they do. Truly a tremendous spin on a stale old tale.  The developers also get into why there is a ball, which is pretty interesting.  The most annoying character is probably Cinders herself. In some ways she behaves like any normal person in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation would. However, other times she's a bit whiny and preachy.  My favorite character was actually the stepmother. She's less of a demon when you get to know her reasoning and motivations. And her drive is impressive.  The side characters beyond the main ones (Cinders and her step-family being the core characters), are less interesting, and it seems like there are some interesting mysteries into their backgrounds that unfortunately don't get fleshed out. Like what the relationship is between Cinder's mother and some of the other side characters. What happened to Cinder's mother?   Gameplay - 10/10  As with most visual novels, it's mostly reading. However, at key points you get to make decisions. I wish I had read about the game before playing to better appreciate the impact of decisions. It would have let me know how important it is to use all of your (I think) 10 save slots so that you don't have to restart the story from the beginning to find all the endings.  Basically, you can be good, neutral or evil based on your decisions. And your decisions impact your route to the ball, which suitor you end up with, and whether you're even happy at the end. I overwrote a lot of my old saves as I went along, so I was really limited in my endings. However, I think there are a total of about 12 variations.  Pretty incredible, eh? The game itself isn't amazing, but when you realize how the developers freshened up the source material, you can't help but be impressed!  8/10",

It's like a visual novel with a whole lot of reading (obviously), but it also gives you a choice from time to time. Choices that affect the story. As a result there are several endings to be unlocked, and a single playthrough can take anywhere between 3-5 hours I think. The art is done remarkably well, even if the faces lack of bit of character and the whole thing feels very polished. Except for a few typos, that is.   I would recommend it to everyone who knows the story or just likes reading. But please note that it's not so much a game, but more of an interactive book. There's very little input required. And let's not forget about the price which is absurdly high. So for now I suggest waiting for a sale.  [Rating: 73/100]",

            "review_text": "Amazing game, and I say that as someone who doesn't normally play visual novels because: a) they are usually drawn in the style of anime, and b) they are usually dating sims -- I find neither of those two things particularly appealing. This game, however, is not even close to being a dating sim (although there are different romance options you can choose to pursue) and the art style is miles away from anime and very beautiful.  The story is a retelling of the Cinderella fairytale with a lot more depth, featuring well-rounded characters, complicated familial relations and meaningful choices. It emphasizes the extent to which characters' personal choices are limited by/the product of their circumstances and surroundings. The wicked stepmother and stepsisters are not simple archetypal chracters but complex figures with motivations and agendas that arise from their life circumstances. The main character Cinders, the young woman who lives as a servant in her own house, is trying to take destiny in her own hands and break free from her current circumstances, but cannot do so without outside help. The game makes a point: despite her desire to be independent and have agency, her available options are nevertheless to some extent the product of particular conditions that are outside of her influence (of her father marrying as he did, of her mother ensuring Cinders gets help when she needs it, etc).   The writting is very good and the choices in the game are meaningful; I found replaying the game to explore different results very interesting. The first playthrough takes about 3 hours, while subsequent playthroughs can be made a lot shorter as there's an option to skip through dialogues that you've read in previous playthroughs.   Definitely recommended for people who love good stories and don't mind reading a bunch.",

            "review_text": "Cinders is very much an interactive novel more than it is a game. By biggest gripe is that whilst you do make choices that can alter the storyline and the ending, there isn't much variation aside from a few scenes playing out differently and a different set of text showing up for the ending 'cutscene'.  But other than that it is a well crafted title. The art work is good and unlike similar games the characters have some (albeit limited) animation. Since you will probably play through the game multiple times there is a very useful function that allows you to quickly skip through dialogue you have already seen, stopping at anything that is new and at any choice you have to make.  If you are a fan of reading and fairy tales you will probably enjoy the game. If a wall of text sends you in to a fit of rage then you should probably avoid this one. Overall I'd give it a thumbs up.",

It's a bit difficult to take a scene seriously sometimes when characters call her 'Cinders' - The game doesn't tell you what personality you have stacked or what progress your relationships are...so sometimes it's hard to know how to progress and confusing if a certain dialogue option doesn't work --&gt; Leads to lots of trial and error - Failing to get the variation you want can be a bit frustrating for completionists - The music isn't too memorable - No homosexual romances, all 3 love interests are male - No customization of how Cinders looks - No voices  This is a wonderful, extensive visual novel and possibly one of the best I've ever played. I've always criticized Cinderella as a character for being one of the most passive protagonists in the history of fairy tales, but in this game you can make her to be the woman you always wanted her to be. She also doesn't always have to marry the prince and sometimes the ending isn't going to be happy. You could even die and have no one mourn over you. The possibilities are vast, giving it lots of replay value. All the art is gorgeous to look at as well so oftentimes I just stop reading and take in the scene.  The developers were right in advertising this game as a 'mature' take on the fairy tale, as all the characters are ambiguous. You can never truly figure each of them out and most of the time, they will surprise you. The game does a wonderful job of consistently claiming that no one is so simple as 'good' or 'evil' and even the kingdom is going through a metamorphosis if you pay attention to the Prince's plot. Speaking of which, the writing is downright brilliant and atmospheric since it is a western visual novel. There are unfortunately no voices, but little nuances in what the characters say give your imagination plenty to give the characters voices of your own.  If you enjoy visual novels with emphasis on dialogue choices, protagonist identity, relationships, and no stat building, definitely buy this game. I hate tedious stat building myself and much prefer making decisions through dialogue. All relationships are accessible provided you have made the choices to develop them; they don't rely on you being 'cute' enough or 'intelligent' enough. Despite my glowing recommendation however, Cinders is by no means perfect and I eagerly await anything else the developers have building off of this amazing genre.",

In execution Cinders is a model of how  visual novels  should be done. Cinders is not much of a choose-your-own-adventure because it is very linear, but your choices do influence most of the dialogue &amp; interactions throughout the game. The multitude of choices leads to large variety in outcomes so you can comfortably do many playthroughs. The art is nice but somewhat limited (not a big deal), same again for the music.  Not exactly touchpad friendly because the hitbox will sometimes glitch and pick the wrong option. So use a mouse or use the autosave function to immeidately go back one choice when the wrong option is mischosen.   Recommended when on sale.",

I would scream with joy if this company/group made an entire serious of games just like Cinders, but exploring the other fairy tales... Snow White, Rapunzel, the Snow Queen by HCA, AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. Then they could start bundling them and selling them as packs. Just a suggestion... or more of a heartfelt wish.  Normally $20 is too much to pay for a game, but I ASSURE YOU that this game is WORTH IT!!! I played it for hours and hours and hours and I still never got every single ending!

My only real complaint is that, on one or two occasions, the parts of a conversation that were affected by my choices and the parts that would have been said regardless (i.e. main plot stuff) did not flow together naturally, making it difficult to determine whether the relationship between my protagonist and a particular character was friendly or hostile.

Usually there are a couple of options with some rather than others being the more 'important' ones that affect the story but here, it seems as if almost every option branches the story in another direction. You help guide Cinders and with the choices you pick, her personality changes and so does the outcomeof the tale. The 'evil' stepmother and stepsisters aren't as black or white in this case - everyone has a reason for doing what they do and the characters are humanized. You're forced to take into account not only the actions but the setting the characters are in; whether they do things considered good or bad, most of the times they're just trying to do the best they can do in that situation.

If this hasn't told you this game is worth playing, then add to that the lovely artwork with small background animations and very realistic and expressive character art, the beautiful music, and the tiny fact that the dialogue speed matches the speed of the character speaking. This last fact really helps you mentally hear how people are speaking. Honestly, it's as close as you can get to voice acting without actually having voice acting in it.  tl;dr Go play Cinders. It's amazing. 10/10",

            "review_text": "If you like visual novels, Cinders is definitely worth checking out. Not only are the visuals astounding, but the writing is solid. It's an overall fun, mature (but *no nudity!*) twist on the Cinderella story. The characters have great depth (depending on how you play the game), and there's several differnet paths and combinations you can take that maximize the playthrough value.   One aspect that might be frustrating is that the game does not make obvious what the different personality choices are coded as. For example, is the choice you picked 'good,' 'bad,' or 'naive?' The lack of labelling makes the game a bit more challenging to get all the endings. If you are looking for a quick playthrough for 100% completion, you may have to go online if you don't want to do it through trial and error.  Overall amazing game with great relationships, story, and visuals. Highly recommended for those who like VNs or those who are looking to get into the VNs.",

I've achieved all the endings and they're all quite satisfactory (even when they're sad). Highly recommended and you'll get a lot of game-play out of this VN!",

And while there's a number of people you can 'date', you have to be very clear on your path with them to get the best endings. There are also paths where you don't end up with anyone at all. All of your actions really do have consequences.   The game is extremely well made. The graphics are stunning and the background sounds work well. The game runs very smoothly and so far, every storyline I've played has been enjoyable.   There were a few times in the game where I felt the dialogue got a bit preachy. The writers obviously really wanted to push the idea that Cinders was strong and independent, but at times it was like they were beating you over the head with it. Don't get me wrong, I love this game and I LOVE the fact that it actually has a strong female protagonist and that the goal of the game isn't necessarily to end up with a man. I think a little bit of subtlety would have gone a long way. ",

The many different paths and endings you can achieve give the game a high level of replayability, along with the the ever so hand 'skip' button (which stops automatically whenever you encounter a new scene or piece of dialogue you haven't seen before.)  This is a visual novel where your choices really do matter. Every component of your relationships with other characters and personal character choices influence the ending you receive. My only complaint is that the price is a little steep, and I was lucky to have gotten this game while it was on sale.  10/10 I would reccomend this to all lovers of visual novels, fairy tales, and dark stories.

Do I get to make a choice?! Let's see: 'Ask to know more about him?' Uh... no, thanks. I've heard enough already... After only 20 minutes I already didn't care one way or another.  It's not that it's bad (although it's WAY overpriced for what it is). The graphics area beautiful, but there aren't that many scenes -- actually a LOT less than in your average hidden objects games -- but I found the 'game' boring, the story boring, and, like I said, there's not even voice-overs to keep you awake.

The soundtrack is great too with a wide range of pieces that draw out a variety of emotions suited to each scene, from tense moments to quiet peaceful mornings.  The dialog is pretty solid and well written, I've definitely seen a lot worse in these kinds of games. The plot of the story is great, holds a lot of mystery and introduces a variety of interesting and distinct characters. With the varied endings, multiple playthroughs can be drastically different depending on the choices you make.  I've only finished the game once and am on my second playthrough at the time of writing this review, but there are at least 3 possible 'romantic interests' for Cinders to end up with that I can see, perhaps more that I have not realized yet.  The dialog choices are interesting because it really feels like you get to shape the kind of personality that Cinders has, whether you choose to make her defiant and rebellious or more meek and complacent, or something in between. There is a lot of variety here and it helps create greater depth and adds to the replayability.  Even if you haven't ever really played visual novel games before, Cinders would be a great choice to break into the genre. It has a lot to offer and does a lot of things well.",
