            "review_text": "Was very keen to try this one... (Watch out people, another long one. This one’s slightly personal).  …for a few key reasons! In its description it reads “Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game inspired by the developer's actual battle with mental illness.”, “Nightmare worlds inspired by real life struggles with OCD and depression”. Which are all points of interest for me. I really enjoy psychology and I have had more than my fair share of mental illness myself in much of the same respects. Being someone who has also had experiences with depression and night terrors, it was almost personal to me. I had to try this game.   I’ve read very mixed reviews on this.  Some love it, others think that it’s not a horror, not scary or compelling enough to play because of its “Walking Simulator” qualities. Which I’d have to say is true to certain extents, there is quite a bit of walking, but the nature of this game is not the norm. This isn’t a typical horror game. I’d say this is more of an experience then a horror game. At least that is the way that it comes across to me.  I was very interested to see what kind of stuff would come up in this from what it’s based on. The difficult thing with dreams and nightmares is you can show and tell someone what happened, but you can’t always bring across the emotions, how you felt and the general tone and atmosphere of the dream for that very reason. An example being that I have a phobia (or Phonophobia to be more precise), an irrational fear, which I could try to explain to someone, but ultimately they’ll never understand the real feeling of having this overwhelming fear for something even you know is absolutely ridiculous.  (This is where it gets personal, skip this section if you frankly couldn’t give a rat’s ♥♥♥♥.) The one thing this game brought back from the back junk filed caverns of my brain was an experience I had. I would wake up (still dreaming) in my room, and the tiniest little detail would be out of place. Whatever was out of place would “clue” as to what phobia I had developed in that particular dream. If I didn’t figure it out in time, I’d be killed. By something relating to the phobia I had just developed. For example, an out of place poster on my wall that advertised Claustrophobia. I didn’t recognise it in time, a TV turned on in my room and it showed rows upon rows of beds, pairs of which that were opposite each other would slowly move toward another, then slam together face to face. Crushing the people inside. Starting from the furthest away and working its way to me I had to force myself to “wake up”. Only to wake up in my room again, a new slightly different oddity in my room, a new clue and a new phobia.  This happened what felt like hundreds of times. Safe to say when I finally woke up for real I was sat on my bed examining my room for something out of place like a true maniac. That experience being what this game reminded me of. It’s not the exact same, but it definitely rang a few bells.  I am beyond a pansy when it comes to scary games and I was able to play this without stopping, hiding behind something and absolutely dreading moving forward like I have with traditional horror games. It’s gory, but it’s not particularly scary. Don’t get me wrong, this game builds tension and suspense and really had me and my heart rate going at times, but I don’t play many horrors games because of how big of a baby I am. If it couldn’t get my of all people’s jimmies truly rustling, I doubt it will for you.  Gameplay wise, you walk, you avoid and you run. There isn’t much to it, but where it lacks in gameplay it makes up in other aspects. The art style and use of colour is wonderful. Things that are coloured can be interacted with. A lot of things you can interest I was honestly curious as to what the significance of. Maybe they are just there for curiosities sake? Some are items you can use but most are just little things in the scene to get a closer look.   The settings are interesting and at times almost labyrinth like. I was torn between feeling like it was linear and I was on the right path and feeling like I was going in circles and was completely lost. It definitely added to the game. Wasn’t at all frustrating for me.   Finally, story. I’m not sure I would go as far as saying there is a story given the nature of nightmares. But you can tell there is definitely a recurring theme. Which is interesting! Made me wonder. This is definitely one of those games I would actually be interested in hearing the developer talk about.   All in all (thank god it’s over, right?) this is a great little indie game. I enjoyed it! It’s an interesting experience and it’s a pretty easy 100% which is always a nice bonus!   TL;DR : (Don’t blame you) You walk a lot and gameplay wise you don’t do much. But it makes up with that with a wonderful art style and an interesting theme/story. It’s an easy 100% and I think it’s definitely worth a try. Especially if you like this psychology hoop-la, like I do! ",

Completely original in both concept and graphic design, and not only are the controls smooth but every aspect about the gameplay itself is extremely intriguing. Neverending Nightmares is very successful in delivering psychological unease visually and through atmospheric ambience, just like pixel horror games such as 'Mad Father' and 'Witch's House' were able to do. Would definitely recommend this game who likes more psychological horror and an interesting yet somewhat cryptic plotline over blatant jumpscares and chases in the more 'traditional' horror games.",

            "review_text": "[I backed this, just so you know.]  It is very tempting to lump this into the 'walking simulator' category. That's pretty much all you do most of the time - you're going through (largely linear) corridors and taking in the scenery. There are no puzzles. There's no inventory. It's short. The player character is slow as a snail. There's little interaction with the environment.  But, there are threats and obstacles to traverse. There are branching paths and endings that range from obvious to very subtle. In fact, much of the changes in the environment (and thus the story it tells) is incredibly subtle and easy to miss. The mechanics present in each chapter are minimalistic (it's always about simply moving, really) - it is clear the entire game has been deliberately designed to have the bare minimum of interaction, to focus on the atmosphere and unraveling of the plot and setting.  This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you don't have interesting (expanded) mechanics to keep the player engaged. On the other, the game builds tension and dread almost perfectly because there is no clutter in-between the player and the spooky. Every time the player thinks the game is starting to get predictable, it throws a curveball. There are some really well done moments (no, not jumpscares, even though there are a few of those as well) that could easily fit in a Clock Tower or Silent Hill game. It would be a shame to miss those.  The (objectively!) best part of the game is the sound design - it is absolutely necessary to play with headphones to get the full experience. There's plenty of dynamic changes to the BGM along with superb sound effects, even completely fine voice acting too. The credits song is practically a Yamaoka homage. Props to McGlothlin.  The artstyle is also worth a mention. Everything is in black and white, except blood and interactive objects that are shaded in different colours. It feels like a cross between a child's scribbles and a newspaper caricature. There is a huge amount of detail put into scenery, and there is one nightmare that makes very good use of this style to keep you on edge. There's a surprising amount of gore and uncomfortable imagery too, making it pop out even more.  All things said and done, if you like horror in general, you'll probably like this too. If you enjoy survival horror though, your mileage may vary. It's worth the couple of hours, especially if on sale.",

            "review_text": "I usually like these sorts of Artsy games (i love stuff like Downfall, cat lady, Gone Home, Dear Esther and co.). So i figured i'd buy this cause it seemed interesting and the art seems good. the game starts out strong, but then after about 30 minutes tedium sets in. you literally walk around the same corridors (same art sets scrambled around) over and over and over for the next 1,2 Hours. The only 'gameplay' from just walking left, right, up, down are sneaking past a couple of enemies (i think there are only 2 types). it gets pretty boring, i found myself just rushing through at the end (holding down the shift button) which resulted in me having to listen to constant wheezing of the character. so i would definately not recommend this game. watch a lets play if you're intersted instead. i feel i spent too much money on this game. 5 bucks would have been ok. this is the first review i wrote, i just had to to let ppl know what this is about.",

            "review_text": "This game is more of an atmospheric horror than a 'jump-scare' horror. There are, maybe, two or three jumpscares. It's slow-paced and repetitive, which, I think, work really well for the game. You pay close attention to all these tiny details, like blinking and shadows, and all the paintings convey all these interesting thoughts. The game makes you wonder 'Why is this here?', 'What's going on?', 'What does this mean?'. I spent more time wondering about the enviroments and the events than being afraid, and I'm still trying to connect the dots of the game.   One thing you're going to notice is that almost all the reviews have a short playthrough time, me included. There isn't a lot to play through. The game is very short. This helps the game stay suspenseful. If you're looking for a game to sink 100's of hours in, this isn't the game for you. You'll want to replay it to acheive all possible endings, but the replaying time isn't long. The short playthrough time creates a tense feeling for the whole game. It should be added that there are absolutely no loading screens in the game, so you never have any release or rest from the tension.  The game is also very heavy with symbolism. The paintings, the art, the ages, the enemies, the colors, they all seem to have unique meaning. I found myself sitting in rooms, staring at the windows or the pictures, or hiding from enemies to observe them, trying to figure out what it meant, how it reflected the character.  The art style is somehow simple and complex. The characters look cartoonish, as does the enviroment, but it still has great detail. A lot of effort went into the design, as everything is hand drawn. Items that you can interact with are colored, like the bronze doorhandles, which is an interesting mechanic that helps negate confusion.   As for the horror elements, I really didn't find the game scary, but there is a LOT of gore. As previously stated, the enviroment is monochromatic, consisting of just black and white. One exeption to this is the blood, which is red. And, oh boy, there is a lot of red. It's similar to 'The Human Centipede 2' in this way, where in that movie, only the blood had color. This causes the blood to stick out and have a drastic impact on the player. I don't want to spoil anything, but as the game goes on, the amount of blood increases, and you get this feeling of dread, like you don't want to go on, but you want to find the cause. This gives me a tense feeling, but not a scared feeling. Gore has never been a scare factor for me, but it might be for you.   Tl;Dr: I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. It's packed with symbolism. It's short, but tense all the way through. It looks beautifuly frightening and sounds amazing. It's not terribly scary, but it's quite immersive. ",

            "review_text": "The nightmare is escalating in its terrifying apparition, not endless, but increasingly nightmarish. There's an amount of degradation to every awakening, where things turn gradually worse. To our despair, not even our bed is what it seems to be, in its comforting, homely tension-breaking, turning into a dark, cobwebbed, bloody mess, but in a weird way, still home, still tension-breaking, still a relief. And in short, this – this awareness of nothing having real consequences, much like Bioshock Infinite: a short animation or cutscene depicting your revival/death followed by reanimation –, along with a slew of other things, is what made this game the not so poignant or interesting experience I expected, considering the visual style and premise.   On the visual style, when zoomed out, and the pixelated low-quality of what's in front of you is not so blatant, it looks rather quaint. The salient reds and colors signifying interactivity is a rather interesting concept, albeit mainly wasted on Kickstarter portraits really serving only to satisfy those backers, and wasting the players time.  Generally, the way they construct the different rooms, the scene design, one could call it, was fairly generic. Elaborately: the conveniently dead-eyed dolls all facing the players point of view (this motif in particular, is not scary in overabundance), the flash of the lightning with the dead-looking sister appearing behind you, gutted animals in the forest, portraits blinking, the faceless manikins, generic pleads for God written in blood, these are all generic design-decisions seen in most lowest common denominator horror movies, and it's simply squandering an interesting premise and art-style that could have brought so much more to the table. Although it wasn't all bad, it was interesting to see the dismembered limbs scattered about, thereafter seeing the pile of dismembered bodies, giving it the credence it needed, beyond the surrealistic nature of dreams.   The level design of endlessly walking through the same corridor, but with a new texture, a new coat of paint, does not excuse it being the same corridor being traversed. I found it incredibly dull and uncreative, it's simply frustrating to be going over the same thing more than once, when in reality it served no purpose. Purposelessness in games is the ultimate disdainful choice a game-creator can make, forcing a player to needlessly – in terms of narrative – do the same thing, and to not give any sort of satisfactory reason or reward for it can really not be in a game, especially not one this short and lacking in substance. There was a sense of enjoyment to every new room explored, but they were seldom seen, and often ultimately pointless. It's immensely disappointing that a game with this much style and potential didn't actually arouse any profound thoughts, or any interesting thoughts at all: springing up from neither art-direction nor narrative, where the chance of creative ideas often resided.   Enemies were introduced in an interesting way, at least the one we come across in the asylum, it was foreshadowed in a fairly obvious jump scare, although still cleverly adumbrated and its function within the game shown by visual design, not by some redundant tutorial pop-up. The gouged out eyes of these adversaries were here the sign of them operating with sound, not vision, such as the other enemy. Furthermore, the AI, rigid as it was, broke the tension by being, well. . . rigid. The encounters you have with these seem more like a puzzle than a fearful enemy capable of horrid acts. It was pattern-solving, not an avoidance of possibilities that could actually spark fear in a person.   Lastly, characters that seem aloof, disinterested, without any signs of distress, do they not bring down the agency of the game? If there is no discernible sense of fear or urgency in the person we play, why are we to fear or tense up to what is going on? It's all too static, unbending, and it needs flexibility pertaining to the reactions of the character we play. Not only to see the urgency of agency, but for the empathy and connection one feels with this character. I stress this because without it I feel this emptiness to the whole experience, it's a common theme in many of these lower budget indiegames, and it's understandable, but it's detrimental to this player-game connection that I feel is crucial in a third-person horror game, because how else are we to immerse ourself into this world, when we don't have the simpleness of attaining that connection to the game that a first-person game easily brings (since it removes the “middleman”).   I have no idea if I actually enjoyed this game, a huge part of me didn't, it felt the scares were cheap mostly due to clichés seen in all types of horror. The art-style was creative but nothing else. The narrative was bare-bones and the resolution seemed shallow and predictable. There is nothing in me that wants to re-live this game, I didn't fall in love with any concept or visual, it was just this experience devoid of real substance. It was okay, in the most mundane and frustrating way possible, because it could have been more, but was left unexplored.",

Naturally, you're supposed to play this game for its narrative which is perfectly fine, but the endings are really nothing more than usual horror 'it was a dream' cliches or just generally feel pretty disconnected from the buildup.

However the only thing bad is the game is extremely short. I finished the game in less than 3 hours. There are 3 very different endings however so you'll have to play through it a few times to get them all. Also the price obviously is steep for a game that you can beat in a short amount of time.",

While it has a few jump scares, the game doesn't depend on them. This is a game you must play with headphones at night.   That said, the whole package is really underwhelming. There's no combat in the game and the most you do is dodge the few predictable enemies in each section. If you manage to make a mistake, you restart in a room just before the one you died in. The enemy system is unchallenging and annoying, and rather than help the game, it makes it tedious.  The game itself is incredibly short, and you can finish the first playthrough in less than one hour and a half. This isn't even rushing through the game, but exploring and examining the locations. Even getting through all the game routes, it'll be hard to go over three hours. I would be able to forgive this if it wasn't for the game biggest mistake: it's really repetitive. The first hour of the game is, as I said before, creepy and atmospheric. Then the game starts recycling assets and themes and the whole experience falls on its face. In the end you'll get one of three endings, and I'm sad to say, they're just disappointing (short, straightforward and not even clever). There's no reason for a game so short to be this repetitive and saying that it was intended to be that way is a terrible excuse.   I mention that the game has a nice style to it, but there are games that do it much better, and for the current price ($15) it isn't really worth getting it.",

I like these creepy indie titles - this reminded me of Knock-Knock so I was all about it. Basically, you just roam around a series of rooms trying to find the right way (ultimately this game is quite linear path-wise). Can't find the right way? No problem, just manage to die and the game will start you very close to where you messed up (I was actually thankful for this mechanic many times because I certainly didn't want to repeat the random journey I just took). You roam around until you hopefully find a point where some bizarre little story moment takes place. This is seriously just a series of random nightmares, which leaves little for story room. Nothing *really* makes sense here (I mean we can theorize, but who knows).   The art is top notch except a few little glitches (why does a light go on when you turn down a perpendicular hallway? Or why does the shading glitch out when you go through a door? -I look past most of this, but just for noting). Honestly, having the blood being actual color red with everything else black-and-white has also been done a million times before. It was cool the first couple times, but is now just cliche. The music and ambience is certainly creepy, and I am sure is awesome with headphones (I played with a group most of the time). My main problem lies in that there was nothing to figure out. No strategy or puzzle or game really. To be straight I am totally fine if it is just an experience, but this really wasn't that (I love Dear Esther, Gone Home, etc.). I played through to one ending, and only encountered two 'enemy' types that were both lame and frustrating. They were both stock 'walking towers' that seem to have been added so it had a 'game' element. The running mechanic was also funny because that freakin' kid cannot even run half the length of the screen without weezing for his life lol.  Ultimately, I wanted to feel connected to this game - it sure seems like a lot of love and care was put into building it. The whole time I just found myself wandering aimlessly around a house trying to find trigger points for the next cutscene. I think this title is worth $5 but not much more. I may play through to see one more ending, but I will certainly not get 10 or 15 hours (for $10 [on sale]) out of this.",

Puzzles are nearly non-existent and unless you have severe brain damage chances are you wont have to think very hard about any of them.   Storyline is probably one of the weakest in any horror game I have played which was dissapointing considering I went through the trouble of getting all the endings because I thought that they may have all been connected only to find that they were not. The game starts with this whole little sister motif that could have been interesting only to derail into completely unrealated stuff about your wife depending on how you played the game and then no matter what ending your going for it just sort of ends suddenly with a ending that had zero build up.   It even comes complete with a 'IT WUS ALL A DREAM!!!' ending which made me slightly angry at the laziness of it all.

As others have said, this barely qualifies as a game for starters. I'm not against 'experiences' and 'digital novels' (I enjoyed Dear Esther, even), but this just doesn't feel like anything. I even disagree with the positive comments about there being decent tension and creepiness - it's a disappointing mess of cliches: creepy dolls? Check. Random dead stuff? Check. Horror movie-style insane asylum? Check. And seriously, for a game allegedly about mental illness, was that last one really in the best taste?  The story is practically non-existent. Just when I thought it might be getting started, it ended. I honestly had to check to make sure it wasn't some weird bug. It really feels like the devs ran out of time.  The thing that piqued my interest in this game though, the sole reason I backed it, was that it's supposed to be about mental illness. As someone with a long history of mental illness myself, I was excited to see a more believable, more intelligent treatment of the subject. Boy was I disappointed. In all honesty, I see nothing relating to mental illness in this game besides the lazy cliches you find in pretty much every horror title (see above).  As far as I'm concerned, the art direction is about the only thing this game gets right. As others have said, the black and white, hand-drawn style is fantastic. But there's no way it's worth anything close to the asking price.  Sorry, Matt. I really, really wanted to like Neverending Nightmares, but it just doesn't deliver.

Well, this game doesnt, and because of the constant reused assets I kept wondering whether I was going the right way or whether I had inadvertantly backtracked and needed to reverse my course.  In itself that would only be a moderate annoyance, but theres also the issue that the levels have way to much *nothing* in them. Out of the time I spent in the first area, I estimate only about 10% had an event in it, either a scare or a monster or something to do, the rest just being padding going from one room to another.  And when stuff does happen, its not well balanced. In the second area, I wound up having to get from one scene to another without being caught by zombies, but there was no way to tell where the zombies were in the screen other than trial and error, there was no way to lose the zombies if they did spot me due to how slow my character ran, and even if I did know where they were sneaking around them was nearly impossible due to how small the areas were, so I would constantly get caught, die, get sent back to the last checkpoint, repeat ad nausium.

I'm not sure what this game was trying to communicate in terms of message, but I at least have an idea that its about depression and blame. There are multiple endings based on what happens when you play, i recommend watching the others on youtube after finishing the game.",

            "review_text": "I am rather torn whether to recommend this game or not... There is some really nice ideas here and the art style is great. That said it is short (not a bad thing really), but the game has three ending paths with choices at the end of two chapters to decide the ending. So to see all the content you have to replay the same chapters and make the choice at the end to see the additional ten minutes of content.   Pros:   - Some effective jump scares  - Wonderful art style.  - Lots of wonderful creepy imagery - An interesting horror story which did not over stay its welcome.   Cons:   - Backtracking.... To see all endings you have to replay about 20 to 30 minutes of content. This is simply the biggest issue with the game.  - Monsters/puzzles are all extremely easy. You see a cupboard then there is a good chance a monster will be in the hall and you will avoid it by hiding in the cupboard... The monsters in the Insanity level I thought were just desturbing imagery until the end of the chapter one kills me and it turned out they had just been easy to avoid up until that point.  - Very linear game play apart from the 3 endings. This makes back tracking frustratingly dull.  - Yes porcelain dolls are creepy, but are heavily overused to the point it just becomes funny.    Overall, this was a unique game and I did generally enjoy the game. It is just a shame that back tracking is such a pain to view all content. The game has flaws but care and time went into making an interesting horror game experience. Therefore, if you enjoy horror games or if you enjoy games that use an interesting art style its worth giving the game a go.",

The artwork's great (they even make it easy to spot landmarks so that you don't get lost, even though pretty much everything's in black and white), and the voice acting is pretty good, as well. Each section of the game pretty much has its own unique set of monsters with the exception of one or two, and that gives a pretty good variety. It's short enough to show a friend to just play through really quickly - I got all of the paths in 3 hours.  A lot of the time, I wasn't really that scared, which is sort of bad news for a horror game. While the atmosphere is pretty scary at first, it sort of fades once you actually get to see each of the monsters - the mystery sort of disappears, and it's really easy to learn how to deal with them pretty quickly. I think the main problem with this game is that it's just a ton of walking with only a small handful of scattered monsters or jumpscares in relatively few places. I don't want to make a joke like 'Walking Simulator 2015' or anything like that, but that did make this game pretty boring. Like I said, if you want to get into horror games, this is a good place to start, but not for $15.",

Made by the same dude who made Retro/Grade, Neverending Nightmares takes a step into another direction towards anxiety, gore, and terror.  You'll play Thomas (hey, that's my name!), who goes through several episodes of recurring, monster filled nightmares. Driven with the need to wake up and obsession of his sister, Thomas' trails will bring you from a dark and maze-like mansion, through a blood-soaked asylum of savage lunatics, to a creepy forest littered with carcasses. How well this setting is narrated to me is what makes this game remarkable: it's incredibly atmospheric, paints everything black and white with spots of gory red, all while dissecting into a mind suffering from depression, anxiety, and obsession.   I fell in love with this game. Although a lot of parts do feel slow, short, and one particular one being frustrating, it gives me time to soak in the wonderfully hand-drawn artwork and creepy music that follows. This game gives me great hope that along with many indie games in the genre, horror is not dead. If the scares and copious amounts of blood and body parts isn't enough for you horror fans out there, then the well-delivered atmosphere will never leave you hungry.  + A frightening and mind-provocative narrative delving into the struggles of depression + An equally gripping atmosphere that stuns you in its beauty before soaking you in blood + Filled with obstacles and terrifying monsters that require different methods to defeat + Branching story-lines that reach different endings + Several galaxies better than Depression Quest, which tried to tackle the same real-life issue of... um, depression.  - An apparent walking simulator, but with a run button - Thomas apparently has asthma, so that run button works VERY briefly - Sweet but short; you might wish for more conclusions to the story - If you have a deathly fear of babies and dolls, well I have some bad news for you...",
