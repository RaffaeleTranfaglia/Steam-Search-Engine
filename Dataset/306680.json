            "review_text": "Edit: Today, when I went to play, all of my existing puzzles had been wiped as if they had never been touched. While I'm glad that we can now replay puzzles in an attempt to get a better score, they have removed any form of showing where you left off. I now have no idea which puzzle I was on last and have to click around to find where I was.  Edit 2: And they've cleared all of my achievement progress with this new change...  Edit 3: Very late edit, but just thought I'd update in case anyone cared. So after talking to one of the devs I've learned what happened to my game seems to be an inexplicable glitch. Neither of us are really sure what happened, but there's no way to recover the undone puzzles and achievement progress aside from just doing it all over again. I appreciate the time the dev took to talk to me and look into things though, and for that reason my review will remain positive.   This game is generally entertaining, but there are a couple of major issues I have. The first, and largest, would be the use of unheard of words. By unheard of I mean obscure animals, variations of existing 'words' (an example being miaow, which apparently is the British version of meow), and some shorthand phrases you'd never expect to see. Another issue I have is after you beat a puzzle you can't play it again, even after some amount of time has passed.   Other than that it's a pretty fun game. I'm sure I'll finish the rest of the puzzles, albeit with some frustration when coming across thing like 'sl' and 'miaow'.",

My only complaint is the rating system; based on average times, which means a couple of bad games can throw your rating and it can be quite hard to recover. I suppose though after playing many rounds this won't be such an issue.  Also, I would like to know all of the possible ratings in order and their requirements, I'm aware only of competent and skilled.  EDIT: now that I think of it I would like to see the board at the end of a completed session. The 'COMPLETED' splash obscures the board.",

In total, there are 288 puzzles to do, ranging from easy to hard (8 sets of 12 puzzles)... So, if you're up to the challenge and have some time to kill, this is the game for you. So far, I’ve completed about two sets of the easy puzzles and look forward to continuing on to the more challenging puzzle sets. Also, I suggest if you end up making the purchase, mute the SFX and play your own music or something. You’ll thank me later.",

The right words will make sense with the rest of the words in the puzzle. There are certain strategies you can use to make it easier to guess the right word. For example, put the letters in first that can only fit into one space. If you don't like spelling or if you are not into games like Scrabble or crosswords, then this is not the game for you. I only wish the game would provide a theme for each puzzle so that you do not have to fish for random words. This game will involve less guessing and more of those eureka moments where one recognizes that a word will fit if you have a larger vocabulary or if you are erudite. If you are a logophile, this is the game for you! :) If you happen to be a lexicographer, this game will probably be very easy for you to complete.",

Where to start.  It's like Crosswords, without hints. It's like Sudoku, without numbers and hints. It's like Scrabble, without someone to play with.  It's like the three of them; without fun.  There's a really big difficulty spike right in the first set of levels. I'm trying really hard to like this game, I just can't.  It's a whole 'see every combinations possible and hope it fits the board with every other letters, then try again'.  That's no way fun, unless you like to guess words for hours.",

This game posits itself as a kind of sudoku, but no puzzle can be solved without making an educated guess, which is something that is a huge no no in sudoku puzzle design. The 'rules' of English are infamously inconsistent,a nd yet are the only thing we have to go on for most puzzles. Thus, even the hardest puzzles manage to be boring. It also posists itself as being like a crossword puzzle, but there are no clues for the words, and the boards are laughably small, probably because it feels like a lazy mobile import.",

No story, no gameplay to talk about, just brooding over riddles and try to figure them out - some are quite a challenge, others are very easy. The game itself can turn into an addiction, because you will come back for more riddles.  Of course, there will be people that are missing the great artworks, or depth of other games, but with riddles you don't need any great art, sound or even story to tell - and it still can be challenging, and bring a lot of joy in completing a given puzzle.

Looked at the first puzzle, switched back to easy.  If you stick to easy the game has a pretty smooth difficulty curve from that insultingly simple first puzzle to guide you into the game. But don't think all the words are going to be simple just because you're in the easy puzzles;  mostly  they've been common ones so far, but it wasn't too far before I slammed into a word that I had to use an online scrabble cheat dictionary for (what the heck's an ibex?).  I've only cleared out the first board and am a bit into the second, but from those I'm willing to give it my recommendation. If you like word puzzles it'll keep you entertained when you have some time to kill.",

Lexica  is another word puzzle game that pretty much makes my head spin as I have to scramble and unscramble letter arrangements to find words...once again. Ugh!!!  Names are words, some typo words are words, and occassionally, you'll drag a letter and it'll get stuck. Dragging a letter sometimes doesn't work in a game all about dragging letters. Let's not forget to mention that once you beat it, you can NOT replay any puzzle without implementing a tricky method because the dev never implemented a REPLAY option...  The overall layout is nice, but I'm not a fan of these word games...they make my head spin. At least I have not had the misfortune to deal with an *sshole dev like the one who made  Ace of Words , though...so that's something.  3/10 Not something I'll revisit upon 100%-ing it.",

With something like a crossword, if you do not know the word you cannot solve the puzzle. Lexica is a bit different because it presents you with all the letters you need to solve for the words. All the information is there; you just need to put it in the right place. Some of the mid-game puzzles I found to be much more difficult to solve than the late-game puzzles. Despite this odd difficuly curve, this is easily the most enjoyable word puzzle I've encountered. Edit: I started to play this game with others and would sometimes return to my laptop to find several new puzzles completed.",
