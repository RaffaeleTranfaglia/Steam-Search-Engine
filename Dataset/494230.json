Heart's Medicine takes the well known time management style and adds lots of inventive mini-games relating to patient care. Story: + There is also an enthralling story intertwined with Allison's internship - been compaired to tv shows 'Grey's Anatomy', 'General Hospital', 'ER' and even 'Days of Our Lives' by folks hearing the story unfold. Sometimes it's a real tear-jerker. Gameplay: + The mini-games mixed into the time management style gives a nice break from the normal 'Chain events and do everything as fast as possible'. I found it a little more difficult to chain events in Heart's than other similar titles. There are still a few click-and-drag actions that I haven't been able to get the gold hearts on, and not for lack of trying! The Gold Hearts are a nice new feature, giving a little help with bonus ratings. There are the usual challenges and bonus stages, similar to other Delicious titles.  I'm about half way through at this point (don't let my play time fool you - had to leave game idling on menu for a while), and have nothing negative to say.",

But the big con is that all this clicking around kind of steals the show, after getting to lvl 50 im dead tired of clicking around on items and running back and forth, so i just want to finish this game as quick as possible... which makes me just skip the small cutscenes with the story because im dead bored from all the clicking....
