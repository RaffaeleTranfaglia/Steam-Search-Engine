            "review_text": "It's Elite, what else is there to say? The sequel to David Braben's seminal space sim classic is finally here, and it's fantastic! Having been an early alpha backer with several dozen hours of flight time logged, I thought I'd give my two cents for those considering buying.  After years (decades!) of waiting, the day that fans never thought they'd see has finally arrived, we have a new Elite game that lives up to the promise of the 1984 original but with all the added graphics and gameplay that modern technology affords us. Elite Dangerous successfully recaptures the spirit of the 1984 original while adding the enhancements of the pantheon of great space sims both big and small that have been released in recent years, from big names like Wing Commander: Privateer and the X Series, and recent indie games like Paragon and Rodina.  So, what is there to game? Strapped into a shiny new ship the player is thrust into a truly massive procedural galaxy, able to hunt, mine and explore, facing off against or working with both other players and the A.I., striving to upgrade their ship with awesome new weapons or buy their way into more powerful craft. All in all it's an enthralling experience, and the meat of the game, from the beautful graphics and wonderful sound effects and music, to the silky smooth handling and personality of the ships and weapons comes together beautifully.  There are still kinks to be worked out of course, some areas of the gameplay seem like they still need to be fleshed out, and there are of course still bugs, but the devs seem to be doing a bang-up job of fixing the old girl up, and I have faith in their ability to continue to do so.  TL;DR; Awesome game Y/N? Hell yes!",

Elite: Dangerous is an amazing and beautiful sandbox to interact with, yet not one to be taken lightly. Expect to put in much research and practice before hopping into a huge battleship; the game is somewhat unforgiving, especially at first. But with a bit of determination, a player can soon wield a fleet scattered all over the galaxy. With 400 billion star systems, there's a lot left to explore out there, and the game is only getting better as time goes by, with a 10 year development plan envisioned. I'll be playing Elite: Dangerous for a long time to come.",

However, if you're looking for a game that gives you the chance to pilot your personal starship across the galaxy, pirate, trade, bounty hunt, and mine asteroids at will, then this game might actuall suit you. Also, don't mistake my saying that this game has no predetermined story as meaning that it has no story.  In fact, it has thousands of stories progressing in real time. You find yourself mining in peace only to hear a news broadcast about a slave revolt in a nearby star cluster. If they succeed, the star system's economy would tank and the ore you're mining would become worthless, you think to yourself. Armed with motive, you swap out your mining laser for a multi-cannon at the nearest orbital station and head to the conflict zone, helping to quiet the revolt.   This game is a sandbox. The story, constantly changing and told through pieces of information you gather from every station across the galaxy, can be molded into whatever shape suits your needs and desires at the time. Like to RP? This game is your best friend. IN SPACE.  That's all for now. See you in the stars, my fellow Commanders. CMDR AZZARANDA, out.",

            "review_text": "Elite: Dangerous is more a simulator than a game. If you are looking for a non-stop action space adventure then Elite is probably not for you. If you want to immerse yourself in a vast universe where you are not the main character, then you should give it a shot.   'Immersion' is the key word in this game. The graphics, the sounds, even the menu designs make you feel like you are in the cockpit of your ship. The controls are fantastically smooth, responsive, and complex.  Ships each have their own unique handling, look, and sound giving them a personality far beyond their basic stats. Being able to thoroughly customize the internal workings of each ship means you can mix and match ship roles as you see fit. Even though many ship types have a primary purpose such as combat or trading, others can be effective hybrids, letting you trade, fight, and explore as you see fit without switching between ships. Though this comes at the cost of not being amazing at any of those things.   Elite requires a lot of patience because it can take a long time to get from point A to B, earn credits, and raise your reputation with factions. But the sheer enjoyability of the gameplay means I don't often mind the time invested. The game may not (yet) have enough depth to satisfy most people, but the gameplay that is there is rock solid and updates are slowly but steadily adding to it. The devs are committed to this game for the long haul, and I'm happy to be patient and enjoy the ride.",

It's the perfect space simulator that's just as much a visual and auditory feast, as it is technically in regards to details. Not super complicated to be a turn off for more casual gamers, but just enough details to make simulator aficionados squeal with glee.  If you've played any of the previous Elite Dangerous games since the 1980s and onwards, then you will find plenty to love here. Heck, if you liked Freelancer or any of the X games, this game will blow those games out of the water. There's a lot of love but in this game. It's polished, feels great, and conquers so much more than other space simulators before it.  Great with keyboard and mouse or gamepad. PERFECT with a flight stick and HOTAS.  Even better, try it with an oculus rift, and you'll never want to exit the game again... Truly amazing.  As it stands right now, the content in the game makes for a vast sandbox full of bounty hunting, trading, exploration, and mining. Plenty of action if that's what you desire, or plenty of 'Euro Truck Simulator' in Space if that's what you want...  The developers keep releasing updates on a consistent basis too. Fixing bugs, tweaking stuff....and even adding awesome new features.  This is a solid spaceship simulator that will interest and hold casual and hardcore gamers for lots of different reasons.  Check out the developer's youtube channel and start watching some stuff, you'll be hooked.",

If you were disappointed by 'No Man's Sky' then this game is a great second option and it actually has multiplayer where you can form a wing (squadron) with your friends.  There's many different things you can do in the game to make money: Bounty Hunting, Mining, Smuggling, Trading, Pirating, Exploration, and Passenger Transport. Trading usually pays the most depending on where you are. For getting started there are alot of tutorials in-game and on Youtube. When I started out I found the default keyboard setup for the game was terrible so I watched alot of videos on Youtube to figure out what would be the best control scheme for me. I finally settled on using an Xbox 360 controller/keyboard combination with 'Voice Attack.'  Other than that there are alot of different ships in the game from the Fer De Lance (my personal favorite) to the Viper all of which are well designed on the interior and exterior. Each are made for different roles some being multi-role like the ASP and Python.   Anyways I think this is a great game and I'll admit it's not for everyone but if you really enjoy space sims with realistic graphics then you definitely want this game in your library.",

I had a long review that became really outdated with the recent changes, alas I give you a new one.  Elite: Dangerous, isn't only a game. It's a dream of David Braben who basicly invented the genre with the original Elite decades ago and made it's sequel totally alone. Roughly 20+ years later here we are with today's technological possibilities, and we have Elite: Dangerous. But why should you care about this, as a customer?   Development",

            "review_text": "I would like to preface my review with the disclaimer that this game is not everyone's cup of tea. I find it wonderful, but for some it's just not the right fit.  Pros:  + Space Ships. Lots. All with their unique cockpits, looks characteristics and sounds. Gorgeous sounds. + Complex outfitting system for said loads of ships. + Diverse activities include: fighting, mining, trading and exploration and missions. + Multiplayer and Single player(need internet for it though) + 400billion star systems, with a populated bubble and huge galaxy to explore(Procedurally generated fileld with planets, stations and so on). + Beautiful graphics and sounds + Relatively well polished, bugs only occasional + Devs who listen to the community's feedback + Mostly great community of players + Competitively playable with KB+M and a monitor, best enjoyed with HOTAS and VR. + A lot of improvements introduced as a part of Horizons are received by players of the base game.  Cons  - Learning curve is steep. It's a learning wall really. Like 4 hours of figuring out basic flight steep. - Not all game activites are fleshed out as well as they could be. (on-going development is fixing this slowly, check back in a year or two if you don't like it atm) - Slow progression, income is balanced in a way that it takes a long time to acquire the more expensive ships and items. (see: grind) - Since all of the game's content is based on procedural generation, mission and npc generation is all RNG based, just like the engineer items they drop, very minimal crafted content. That is occasionally frustrating  With Horizons you get: 2.0 Planetary Landings 2.1 Loot and crafting (released, bit grindy but allright) 2.2 Ship Launched fighers (soon to be released, according to beta testers it looks great) 2.3 Multicrew and Commander Creator (no details known atm.) 2.4 4th update with unannounced content  In summary, I do recommend this game. I personally love it. But I do see it's flaws, and that this game is definitely not for everybody. I recommend trying out the free tutorial missions to wet your appetites. If that works get the base game and if you end up loving it, buy Horizons too.",

That being said this game is not for everyone. It requires some level of patience, and the will to explore and take in the beautiful universe that Frontier has given us. I personally, are one of those guys who loves to play this game for its beauty, regardless of its lack of content or repitition. So as I am going to recommend this game, however, I also must say that this game may not be for you. If you do not like repitition, like completing the same types of missions over and over and constantly grinding, or don't care for exploration and have no patience, this game is not for you. But if you have the same mind like I do, and wish you could just go out into space and explore, then by all means purchase the game!

A few weeks ago I then saw it here on steam, saw the vids, watched a bit gameplay and then bought it.   The price is high, yes, but justified.   First off, I never played any of the other Elite games nor Freelancer or whatever. The game has barely to no story whatsoever, you start up the game, you watch the tutorial videos (what I really really reocommend you to do) and start a new game.  The game then throws you into your cockpit in a dock at a station and...that's it. You're free to do whatever the f*** you want.  And that's what I like about this game. No boundaries. You could go out bounty hunting, you could go courier style, mine asteroids, trade various goods or explore the vast, seriously  freaking huge  space and sell the exploration data. I will admit, that a story mode or story missions would be a great addition to the game. Like one major quest and maybe some bigger sidequest revolving around the three main factions in the game, a bit like the guilds in Oblivion and Skyrim. But it's still in its baby shoes and they'll add that, but even now the game is entertaining as hell.  The controls are, I admit, a bit hard to grasp at first and there's a lot of them and you might need some time to set them up properly so it fits whatever you use. I use a keyboard and a joystick and it works great, but also tried an Xbox controller, which also worked good. People said that even mouse and keyboard only work fine. This is a space sim, where you control all the functions of a damned spaceship and not a bobby car.  This is not, install, start up and jump into the action game. It needs some time and its complex, but once you worked out the majority of the stuff you'll understand.  The graphics are, well, gorgeous. It looks highly polished and smooth. No graphic glitches or similiar. The The effects are amazing and the HUD design (or really, the cockpit of the vessel you control) is nicely done. The first time I jumped into hyperspace to travel to a new system...I just sat there in awe and all I could say was 'wow'. It's really well done. The stars are well animated and are nice to look at. There's currently only a handfull of different space station designs...so it's not all that diversified in that regard. The ship designs are...well. The following is only my own opinion, in question, just look up the different ships online and judge yourself. Some of the ships look really really cool. But those are mostly the end game ships. The early ones are derived from the original Elite games...from the 80ies. Some ships just look like geometrical shapes with cockpits smacked on them. Cobra, Sidewinder, namely. They have appeal, and I understand the nostalgia factor for some of the players, but that's not the majority. But I hope they'll add some more nice early to mid game ships in the future.   The gameplay itself is smooth and as polished as the graphics. Very well made. The combat is awesome and challenging. Trading, courier stuff and mining is for me personally too boring and has too less PEW PEW LAZORS, but some will surely like that.  You can play the game in a MMO enviroment with other players, alone (but you need to be online) or in a solo world, but with a friend(s). The MMO version is barely any different from the solo one and players are friendly and don't just KOS everything that moves. But docking at some stations is annoying, since there's lots of players who want to dock at the same time. But then switching to solo quickly is easy and happens smooth.  The soundtrack is also well made and not too obnoxious. But it should be noted, that this game is very well suited to let your own music play while gaming.    As a side note, my internet at home died two days after playing, because our provider had issues, so I played solo only and used USB tethering with my phone and it's data plan. It worked very well and used up after 10h playing only 22MB.    If you like games like Skyrim and Oblivion and you like Space and ♥♥♥♥ and don't mind a somewhat lacking story mode alltogether, then you won't regret buying this.   My rating:  2001/10, 'An Der Schönen Blauen Donau' plays while docking ;)",

            "review_text": "After almost 200 hours playing this game, with mixed feelings about its execution from its development team, I'd like to say that overall I think the game is a great success.   Lots of complaints about various aspects of the game being lackluster are understandable I think. The update cycle from the the development team has been slow, but considering the breadth of the game I feel that it is warranted. Especially with the release of each Horizons release (Engineers has been a great update for missioning, for example).   I come back to this game all the time and always keep it installed. I have two flight sticks and plan on getting an Oculus Rift (which I've heard is absolutely incredible). Yes, it takes a lot of time and effort to grind at it, but I feel satisfied with the payoff.   You also have to be on top of tailoring the game play for you, which is exactly what makes it such a great simulator. You want to explore? Better come up with a game plan, a ship load out, and some netflix movies to watch while you do it. You want to harass an warring system? Better plan all that out as well. This game is no arcade shooter.   So for those still sitting on the fence, you have to know that delving into E:D is a long haul investment. The core of the game is as solid and stable as you'd want for being fully released. Its just the kinks that draw criticism from their fans.   Those kinks are worth it for me for being able to fully pilot a ship and go anywhere in the (hugely expansive) galaxy that we live in.  Edit: I've since received my Rift and am running on a GTX 1080. Runs very smoothly but they've locked the resolution at 720p to keep the framerate up. Still, the novelty of being able to look completely around your cockpit and out of every window was worth it.   Not being able to see your keyboard is a bit of a pain, especially in dire situations. Totally worth it, though!",

You'll need more than just the base version of the game though, the expansions are awesome and incredibly necessary to the game. The game has indepth tradeing and fighting mechanics, custimization runs deep and the ship full different expantions. There is a wide variety of ships, and soon (if you have Horizons) more stuff will come such as character creation. This game is immense and is still ongoing, remember this is a game that has many more expansions to come, the base game is finished YES, but the good stuffs just around the corner.  It's for an extremely niche audience because of how serious the whole game is, however believe me when i say that the finished product after all the expansions come out will dwarf over any other sapce sim, including Star Citizen. Star Citizen fan boys say that because ED is so big there aren't any hand crafted solar systems, which is oblivously comeplete garbage xDD, of course there are hand crafted locations. This game is one of the few ambitious games that is going towards its goal in the completely correct way, this game will succeed and i highly reccomend you hop aboard now! :DDD",

I picked it up in a sale with the intention of playing in VR, and it's been one of the most 'addictive' games I've played recently. I've (at time of writing) clocked nearly 50 hours after 10 days of ownership--that's not the kind of attention a 'bad' game gets from me.  Yes, it's a bit of a grind and perhaps not the most 'driven' game with finite goals or anything to speak of. But when it comes to just cruising around space, enjoying the view, and occasionally grouping up with a buddy and flying around collecting bounties, it's probably one of the coolest things you can do--*especially* in VR.  I haven't played the game outside of VR and have no intention to try. I admit it might be a bit boring and excessively monotonous without it; But by damn, it's something else with the immersion of a VR headset. The UI is incredibly intuitive (if a bit low-fidelity on current HMDs), looking around to open systems is so natural and works brilliantly. Playing with a mere Xbox 360 controller, despite many people making it sound like it might not be enough, but it's just fine. Takes some getting used to sure, but it handles with an arcadey-enough feel that it's fine for PvE combat.   Seriously, the game isn't the most engrossing thing out there or something you play to 'finish', and I haven't even given any interest in the PvP....But when it comes to just diving into the depths of space in a virtual reality space and just losing yourself for HOURS on end, perhaps with a podcast running, it's something you just can't beat.   Don't let the negative reviews throw you off (Seriously, a negative review after 300+ hours? Give me a break), it's worth the entry price and if you haven't gathered buy now, a must-buy for playing in VR.",

            "review_text": "What is Elite Dangerous? Elite Dangerous is a very realistic space simulation game set within the Milky Way galaxy (or as I think of it, home) and is the fourth game in the Elite franchise (Elite, Frontier (aka Elite 2), Frontier: First Encounters (not aka Elite 3?) and now Elite Dangerous. The main progression is earning $$$ (Credits, CR) to purchase better ships and equipment. After that it's open ended: become a legendary pirate, find aliens, become the CQC champion (hahaha, I'm so funny).  Starting out: Congrats, you made the excellent life choice of buying this game, what do you do now? Well, the problem is, you're in the Sidewinder, a glorified metal box with some engines attached. It's useless (in the event that a friend says otherwise, check their ship for Onionhead). My advice is this: jump to Eravate (aka noon central), dock at one of the stations there (/die trying) and pick up some easy, well paying missions (100,000 CR should do). After that, you have a choice: Wanna be an Explorer? Buy the Adder, it won't be very profitable but you can make a start if you want. Wanna be a Trader? Buy the Hauler, semi-profitable but very grindy. Wanna be a Bounty Hunter? Buy the Eagle (or Viper Mk III if you have enough), it's risky but it can be very profitable. Wanna be a CQC Champion? Hahaha, I really need to stop with that joke After that, get the Cobra Mk III and you're away.  To Horizons or not to Horizons? That is the question. The DLC is good but it has a long way to go yet, despite Frontier's best efforts. Firstly, decide if you like the game enough to pay £20 for unfinished DLC (if you answer yes then you're as crazy as I am!) If not, wait for the DLC to be finished, or pick it up in a sale.  In conclusion, whether you want to be a renowned smuggler or a CQC Champion (sorry, had to do it again), if you like space sims and you're prepared to put time into it, this game is for you. If you like it enough, bring a friend, (they'll probably play for about 20 mins and give up) because Multi-Crew is just around the corner (in 2017).  Fly safe Commander.  And another thing, you don't need a £1000 high-end gaming PC, the game still looks great on low graphics.",

Likewise, exploring is boring in my view as well. Jumping from system to system, slowly scanning planet after planet... fulfilling for some, boring for me.   However.   This is a simulator, remember? And if you like some heart-pounding space combat simulations, then game isn't half bad. Be a bounty hunter, an assassin, a soldier. Fight for a side, or just for yourself. Become a pirate and rob from those you drag out of frameshift (hyperspace).   Want to mine? Sure, be my guest. But avoid the pirates that linger in the asteroid fields, ready to rip any unsuspecting miner apart for the mearest slightly-valuable hunk of ore.   The game is what you make it, partly. I went from a bored merchant to a rip-roaring bounty hunter, taking on ships quadruple my size for monetary rewards that I drool over thinking about it now.

It's 'love it or hate it' territory, which is why it has 'Mixed' reviews.   You get out of it what you put in.   Criticism that 'it has no plot' or 'wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle' are just silly. It's one of the deepest games out there, and as for the plot... well, not only is there a developing narrative which you can pick up on 'GalNet' (the in-game, in-lore news channel), but players can genuinely shape the story and the game. The devs are extremely responsive to player behaviour - which is frequently incorporated into game lore. Google 'the fuel rats' to see what I mean. There's really no other game quite like it.  * Incredible graphics - not just high fidelity but realistic, as in when you are approaching planet rings you see the smooth rings resolve into the huge rocks the rings are made up of, as you approach. See it to believe it.  * Realistic galaxy. Here's how realistic the game is: You can hunt pirates in resource extraction (mining) sites within planet rings, but best beware when the planet's shadow falls over the place where you are in the planet ring, as it becomes virtually pitch black (best turn on your ship's headlights, Commander!) and there are asteroids everywhere to collide with. I learned to avoid RES at 'night', very early on.  * The audio is as good as the graphics, if not better. Every ship sounds different. When your cockpit canopy blows out, the sound becomes muted, as there is no air, and you have only your facemask to protect you. The dominant sound becomes your own panicked breathing which you hear on ingame audio. Really, very very good stuff. Music is minimalist yet very effective. Not intrusive at all, and changes subtly to suit in game events.  * Gameplay and replayability is very good. The dogfighting is exceptional - it just 'feels' right. When flying normally, you feel like you are in a spaceship. TrackIR and VR are all supported very well. The ship interface involves looking around the cockpit to activate control and info holopanels, so headlook is really useful. Longevity wise, I will be playing this game for years. My combat rank is 'Elite' (highest) and I still don't feel I've scratched the surface. Sort of game you can play for a month, then put it aside for three, then come back for a while, then have a break. So many reviewers play the game for 200+ hours, 'burn out', then claim it is 'repetitive grind'. Mate, put it aside for a bit, have a break, come back to it, fresh, and ready for new space adventures.  To sum up: Just an amazing game. It has some flaws, but still the best space game out there, by no short measure. You'll need to be prepared to invest in it, but once you do there is literally no game that does what Elite does, let alone does it as well.",

Edit: Updating this review to reflect the fact that I now have over 60 hours in this game.  On the serious side, this game is a simulator. The reviews both good and negative will tell you that. You're in a space ship, and you do stuff. Your path is your own. Since I've written my original review, the powerplay feature was added. This basically allows players to participate directly in the games evolving story by doing things like completing events and pledging allegiance to leaders. The in-game news, Galnet, has actually featured special player groups and so on. I even saw a story with a guy with a 35 million credit bounty on his head (that is a metric ♥♥♥♥load, for those who aren't aware). As such, I've made it my end game goal to make the front page of Galnet and assasinate the Emperor.  In my time playing in open play (cause I'm not a peasant) I've had plenty of interesting encounters with other players. I've been invited to join wings and go bounting hunting by randoms, I've had chats regarding the situation of the system's economy, and even been sexually harassed. My favorite to date is when a friend and I had just arrived at a star port from a neighboring system carrying a haul of polymers to trade. We noticed a bunch of other players at the port, and decided to mess around in the chat. I proclaimed myself the Billy Mays of polymer salesmen, offering to sell my 'dank polymers' for only 1999 credits.

Cons: You will eventually find bugs. You will find features that are not fully implemented because Elite is in development and will be for a long time. Frontier has planned to develop the game for 10 years. Be patient, developers are working hard to improve the game and smash bugs.  If you buy the game there is a lot of good Elite has to offer right now. I have 500+ hours gameplay and still loving every minute of it.  See you around the galaxy.  ",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Flight sims are hard. Elite is a flight sim. Expect some learning curve. Otherwise, it's fun as heck to be Han Solo. It's the Han Solo simulator. Be a dirtbag, be a goodguy, do whatever you want.  ---------------------------------------  I've been playing Elite: Dangerous since it's beta test, and recently added it to Steam so folks can see that my 'online' status in Steam actually meant 'Playing Elite: Dangerous'. My only regret is not getting in on the kickstarter.  So, what Frontier plans on is releasing the fully ambitious Elite: Dangerous in chunks. They are constantly adding stuff, and will continue to do so, hopefully forever. In it's final form, it's going to be the game that popped into my head when I first heard the words 'Star Wars Galaxies' (which is NOT what Sony made). Massive multiplayer, persistent universe; live another life in a science fiction game. They even support VR and higher-than-normal graphics resolutions in anticipation of future performance expectations. So, it's gonna be around a while.  In the meantime, the flight sim part of the game takes some practice. Once, you've learned how to not slam your ship into things, there's a lot you can do: make money in various ways, change which factions control star systems, participate in the political power struggles larger than a single star, modify your ship/s, and all of the above on the surfaces of airless worlds. (And all with or without other players.) The game is already gigantic, and if you get bored, just wait for the next update to make it even more gigantic. There's always more.   Elite is heading in the direction of 'GTA-MMO: In spaaaaace'. The next update will add personalized player avatars and multicrew ships. So we'll finally be able to recreate the Millenium Falcon gunnery scenes from the Star Wars movies. In fact, at some point, there will likely be players who don't fly and are just professional crew. Perhaps further along, players who just play Elite to craft goods or ships. The sky is not the limit.",

            "review_text": "Elite: Dangerous makes Star Wars look like amateur hour...Without the lightsabers and magical religion with fanatical samurai followers... Let me just put it that way right now.  The game is pretty much a first person version of EVE Online. It puts you in with a very brief, to-the-point tutorial system, and after that, you're on your own! Dropped in the middle of some starbase in an obscure, unfamiliar, GIGANTIC! INCOMPREHENSIBLY HUGE galaxy(I've heard there are over 400 billion separate, identifiable objects in the map...Not confirmed info by the way!)  The game is pretty much....Well...The storyline of the game is that for you, there is no storyline...You're about to create it! You are given a free ship, and the lowest of the low armaments and utilities, and you're set against the entire galaxy with nothing but your cunning...Aaaand hopefully more than a little bit of pre-gaming research! Once you even figure out how the darned controls work, your next order of business is deciding what you're going to be...A trader? A smuggler? A pirate? A mercenary? There are many more things you can do than that, but I'm just not aware of them yet(Allegedly). Next up it's pretty much exactly like EVE Online; you jump from star system to star system with your Hyper Drive, go do what you arrived at the spot to do, and then hop skotch from system to system back to where ever you're going, etc. etc. Sounds pretty simple right? Trust me, it's not. From intercepting pirates, to the crushing, almost inescapable gravitational pull of stars and black holes(If you get too close!), there are all manners of things to look out for...Even the damnably easy sounding task of docking at a flipping space station! GAWD! Could they have made it any more difficult!?!?!?  Be that as it may...If you like space ship games, and more importantly, if you like a challenge, then I couldn't recommend this game more. It's great fun, and you really get that sense of achievement, even from something seemingly simplistic like doing a mission! Everything in this game is automatically set to Very Hard difficulty, and if you can't handle the complexity, then I suggest going with something easy, like Star Trek Online or something.  And the graphics? Well considering I have a GeForce GTX 980 Ti, then I'm probably not the go-to person for those with lesser hardware in comparrison, so honestly, I have absolutely no idea how well this game works at lowest settings. But for the high tier hardware users, you're in for a treat. This game is absolutely stunningly beautiful, and every detail is taken into consideration. If your thing is eyecandy, then you're gonna LOVE this, even just sitting in the cockpit(A ♥♥♥♥ PIT!? WHERE! TOSS ME IN PLZ!!!) is a thrill ride for those enjoying big fancy graphics!  Seriously, if you enjoy video games about space travel/combat/exploration, and if you enjoy your games being natively difficult, and making every accomplishment you make, a considerably important one, then I highly, highly suggest you get this title! But if you prefer your games to be simplistic, easy, and generally casual, then I don't think you should give this one a go.",

Before I wrote this review, I wanted a short and snappy line of text that would get a few 'funny' votes. But this game doesn't do short and snappy. So, buckle up and enjoy the badly structured ride that is my review. Or keep scrolling. Whatever.  You can fight, you can mine, you can trade, you can hunt; and much more; and honestly, this is one of the few games I have played that actually require skill to do all of it. Success in battle isn't due to who has the biggest guns (although it helps) it comes down to who can fly rings around the opponent (actual pilots are probably quite good at this game). This is what makes Elite: Dangerous different to any other current or upcoming space sim: The realism. Flying a spaceship from your bedroom seems odd, but hours fly by; I can remember battling, trading and flying but never once can I remember touching a keyboard or being aware of the real world (which can be a little odd); becuase this is the most immersive game I've ever played.   Some of the reviews here talk about how it's 'Eurotruck sim in space' and to be honest, that's kind of awesome; but only if you exclusively trade. Yes, it's the most profitable of the different roles the player can fill, but for realistic reasons. My advice is, get a good TV show on in the background. Of course, you could say that what's the point in buying a game if you're just going to ignore it, but you'll soon have a new ship (probably the Anaconda, if you go via the trading role - or any role, really. Just trading gets you there the fastest) that can fight, and you'll taste the adrenaline and excitement that can only come of a random encounter with another player in the deep vastness of space. And killing him mercilessly.   But if none of this appeals to you, then think of the opportunity this game gives you to explore the galaxy that we live in; to visit stars (and eventually planets), black holes and nebula that actually exist; I bought this game becuase, to quite a certain cliche, I was born to late to explore the earth and too early to explore the universe. And I'm afraid of deep water, so that scuppers any other exploration I could do :). I bought this game to see the stars, up close - sometimes too close, hehehe. This game is more than a game. It's our galaxy, in all its vastness. And you can go to every part of it. just some places will kill you. Horribly. Unless you get interdicted by Jhombus Rhombus the dirty AI Pirate Lord, in which case you're about to see an Anaconda up close.",

Exploration is so much fun when you get a ship capable of doing it well. There's lots of breathtaking systems out there waiting to be discovered. Physics nerds should bring a towel.  On the flip side, it recieves a lot of flack lately because theyre working on adding some new game mechanics allowing people to pledge loyalty to a faction and help their faction conquer space. The new mechanics require rebalncing of old mechanics, which is never a sure fire thing. I suggest you keep that in mind if you decide to purchase.

Update as of 2016, Horizons might be worth it still depending on the quality of the content to come. Planet textures are shoddy and atmosphereless landings, while adding great immersion to the game, are somewhat boring due to it all looking roughly the same. One more positive thing to say about the developer despite their season pass shenanigans... frontier has managed to retain an impressive level of balance between weapons, hardpoints, and ships.

Things can get boring though, so play with a friend!   KEEP IN MIND: This game is not perfect and it's still in development and there are things being added, tweaked, and or fixed almost constantly. Also, playing this game with a stick and throttle will make your playtime much more enjoyable.  Pros:  1) I put in well over 200 hours into this game before the whole Steam page fix (back when the Horizon's pack was sold sepearately as it's own sepearate thing).  2) From smuggling, exploring, to collecting bounties, you name it and it's probably in this game (or at least added later on).  3) This game, honestly, is way more fun when playing with friends or with other players in general. I mean, I got to go canyon racing with a community of players. What more can you want?! 4) The Faction system is extremely interesting and has the potential to change the way you play the game (A buddy of mine almost got shot to shreds just by jumping into the wrong system controlled by an enemy faction) 5) This game is absolutely gorgeous especially when you're playing it with some sort of VR system  6) Gameplay is solid and pretty easy to get into and not overly complicated, especially if you have a stick and throttle.  Cons:  1) This game can get frustrating at times especially with the new AI and other players. It's part of the experience, but just like DayZ, you will encounter players who will stop at nothing until you're dead just for their own pleasure.  2) Not only that, space as you know is big. Really... Really... BIG! So at times, especially if you're a trader or explorer, this game can get dreadfully boring. This is known as Space Trucker Simulator for a reason.  3) The   biggest   con of this game is the fact that Horizons is sold as a separate season pass instead of being part of the actual game. I don't care what you have to say about it, but the fact that I have to pay an extra $30 to land and explore moons or some planetary bodies is utter bullsh*t. Fortunate for me though, I bought Horizons by itself last year, so I don't feel completely ripped off, but this reason alone is a huge reason why Elite Dangerous has Mixed Scores on this steam page. 4) There are still plenty of bugs in this game. Fortunately, this game has (in my experience at least) great support so any glitches, bugs, or issues you encounter will probably be fixed relatively soon.   Conclusion:  Bottom line, despite the problems, this game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it whenever it goes on sale.",

It runs great, it looks great, and it's great fun. Yes, it does have a high learning curve. Yes, even after playing for 8 hours I still feel like I only understand a tiny fraction of the game. But that's what makes it exciting. It's exciting to me that just about everything from landing your ship to going into hyperdrive takes knowledge, patience, and skill.   I have ran into tons of other players without every looking for them. I guess some people's experiences may differ, but I have ran into people and had interactions in remote parts of the galaxy without even looking for them. I have had a blast just looking at all the stuff my ship is capable of, the things that I will be able to do with my ship once I earn more credits, the scope of the galaxy, everything.  It's amazingly fun and exhilarating. Do not be persuaded by the seemingly large amount of negative reviews like I almost was.

            "review_text": "First of all i will say that i have been playing the game since its launch in Dec 15 2014 when it wasnt on steam yet and i feel its due time i write a review for this game. The key was obtained through frontier directly as they provided steam keys for players who bought the game originally through their store. Although there have been  some   controversy over the horizons DLC/Season pass i would definitely say its getting better with each update bringing a good amount of content plus guality of life improvements.    i got it for 15 bucks in my currency which is about 12 USD so its definitely a good deal for me     There are 2 more major updates to the horizons season pass as planet landing,engineers and ship launched fighters are already out. The horizons season pass can be considered essential in maximising ship potential in pvp combat but in other areas the base abilities of ships are adequate. The next update would be the ability to do multicrew with friends on the same ships followed by a mysterious update that we have no idea what it contains yet    Thargoids i hope   .  The ship handling in the game is absolutely great as it follows a newtonian flight model. The supposed grind of the game is definitely a factor in which many consider when buying the game but then again it is only to get the largest ships in the game. The smaller ships are able to accomplish what most large ships can do almost as well and in some cases even better. It is highly advisable to play the game at your own pace and not to just grind out the credits or ranks. That will definitely cause most to be burned out and feel the grind but everything can be obtained as long as you play the game normally. It might take awhile but everything can be achieved eventually. The learning curve for the game is rather steep and a quick look into the controls for your ship can give some a heart attack.  There are also a massive amounts of HOTAS and controller setups that are fully rebindable but the most popular joysticks have already been setup by the devs and it is as simple as plug in, select the joystick from a list and play.    Personally i use just the keyboard and mouse so thats completely applicable too     The game is a very niche title that will definitely bore those who want instant gratification. The times where nothing happens and the universe simply exists is always more than the exciting moments. Unless of couse you decide to do bounty hunting or carry a single ton of cargo in which pirates will hunt you down mercilessly. Everything in the game takes patience and a lot of time to accomplish such as supercruising to a starport or jumping to multiple systems. It is definitely possible to simply have a youtube vid or a podcast playing in the background while you play the game.  Finally for those new players who actually decide to buy the game, the elite subreddit is a great place to ask your questions without having them shot down immediately. The community is always ready to help new players regardless of what questions are asked and will come together for special events in the game. The tutorial missions are also overhauled with the ship launched fighters update as they now provide fully voiced tutorial missions and instructions.

            "review_text": "Elite: Dangerous is an amazing space sim with the best atmosphere in gaming I have seen yet, and not to mention the amazing sound effects, and beautiful graphics. I recommend this game 100%, but there is one VERY BIG THING that really pisses me off about it.  You have to have a %^&amp;@$%@#$@#$#@ internet connection! Even if you play solo (which I understood as offline before purchasing(but not the devs fault, I could have looked it up)) you have to be connected to the 'main' server. I play solo, and have only played solo thusfar, and apparently they took the server down for an update or something (I have really good internet, plus I was still connected after the fact) while I was doing a time sensitive mission, I got kicked off and couldn't get back on. Its freaking 2015, we should not have to do this crap. Very irritating. Anyway, rant free review below.  I have played space sims off and on over the years, from the incredible X series, to orbiter, KSP, Evochron Mercenary, and I'm sure there's more. So when I say it has the best atmosphere I have ever seen is really saying something. It all feels so... touchable. The cokcpits (though somewhat generic, so far anyway) are all very immersive. And that is one of the areas this game kills in: Immersion. The sound effects, graphics, and sheer scale all make the best atmosphere.  Combat. Combat is a very important part in space sim games. No matter what career path you choose, be it either trader, explorer, or bounty hunter (obviously a lot of combat with the last one ;)) you will end up in combat at some point. The ships handle differently in a very nice noticable way. Upgrading from the starter ship to the next slightly better fighter feels like a good accomplishment, and it has nice rewards. Having more firepower as well as speed and agility makes the combat so much more fun to watch the carnage of your foes. It can be difficult, but when the odds are against you and you finally mark that last target down as a kill is one of the most satisfying feelings in this game.   Trading. Trading is kinda meh in this game. Buying/selling really doesn't impact the economy as you would imagine, if at all really. Its just buy here and sell there for some profit, no impact on the galaxy's economy.  Exploring. This is a very nice thing to do when you are tired of bounty hunting. But for me personally, I think I explore enough hunting down my targets ;) There are some beautiful systems out there to see, with beautiful planets and stars, all in a simulated Milky Way galaxy. I am currently trying to make my way to our home system Sol, its not terribly far from the starting point, but I am very excited to see what 1,100 years did to our home.   Overall I do really enjoy this game, and I highly recommend",

VR though makes the game play smoother when it comes to looking at your ship monitors and dog-fighting. It can feel a bit like grinding but its fun to look out in space.

You can explore, join a wing, and head to the centre of the galaxy. The game has an INCREDIBLE amount of depth. An entire, fluid, in game economy.

I was on my way for a mission where I had to pick up some rebel plans that were in another system. So I jumped there and suddenly I'm to close to a blue sun. My systems overheated immediatly. At around 200% overheating I managed to get out. I let my shield restore but my systems took some damage. I activated my discovery scanner and got a message at which planet the cargo is. After I orbited that planet for a while and I got the exact coordinates. I dropped out of supercruise and pick up the cargo. Suddenly two ships jumped in and caught me off guard. I tried to run but I had to close the cargo hatch first since that slowed me down. In the meantime I took hits to the thrusters and while I was at full speed they malfunctioned and I drifted away unable to steer. I diverted all power to shield to recharge them faster and rebooted my ship. After a short time the thruster came back online and I could finally jump out. And thats how I earned a whole 100k credits ...   Thats an example what can happen on a seemingly easy mission ... It's called Dangerous for a reason. So what do you get? Exploration, combat and flightsimulation based on the environment, basic crafting, planetaty landing and exploration, mining and online multiplayer without subscription. Many other features coming in future expansions. I would not recommend playing this without a joystick though. Some say the mouse and keyboard controls are ok but I don't like it.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, this game isn't for everyone.  It's got a steep learning curf, but with that, also a lack of content. However..  The game's simulation aspects are insanely well done in my oppinion.  And once you get the hang of the controls, you truly feel like a Captain of your own Spaceship.  You should get it if:  -You like very realistic simulation -You like competing against other factions, for territory -You don't mind a bit of a grind, to get newer Spaceships -You like exciting Space Combat (PVP &amp; PVE) -You like playing with friends. Currently, Elite offers quite a nice COOP play feature. (It's also got singleplayer) -You like a very realistic damage system (Example, someone aims, and destroys your powerplant, or thrusters, they will cease to function. Making tactical combat a real thing in elite. You can even destroy someones cargo door, and scoopy the looty  -You like MMO's that don't have Pay 2 Win (And also not having to pay a Subscription Fee) (Hint Hint, Eve online) -You like Trading, and being a merchant  (Optional Horizon Pass Extra's) (Some features may not yet be in the game)  -You like exploring true to life scaled Planets (Only barren planets, for now) -You like customizing every hardpoint of your ship, with custom, and unique attributes -You like owning huge ships, (not yet capital ships) that can deploy ships of their own, to help fight of enemies -You like flying the same (Possibly larger ships) with your friends.   You should not get it if:  -You dislike hard to learn controls -You dislike waiting for more content (Development is slow, But filled with plenty of carefully designed details) -You don't like creating your own adventures (The game might get boring if you only grind) -You dislike the whole roguelike feeling of the game. If you die, you pay your ships insurance costs. if you don't have enough money, you go bankrupt, and have to start over. (However, this rarely happens, as you can get a Loan)   In short,  Elite dangerous is a very carefully, and realisticly designed Space Simulation game. It contains plenty of features, that i would definitely deem worthy of your 25Eur price tag.   Much more than No man's sky fits its 60Eur price tag. That much is sure :/",

Balance/Depth    I just want to get these complaints out of the way. Some things aren't balanced well and there isn't much depth. For example, there is almost no statistical reason to pick most ships for combat over the Vulture. It's just broken. It's so good that it's ridiculous. Certain modes of gaining money aren't as good as others. Trading is the most profitable but also not as engaging. Exploration is the least which is upsetting as it is my favorite. There is also barely any depth to the game. What you see is really what you get. That doesn't mean that it isn't fun, it's just not that deep. (That was very vague because I don't know what else to say about it.) However, these definitely aren't dealbreakers for me in any way.     Graphics    It's gorgeous. What else can I say? It's space.     Gameplay    The gameplay is solid and broken into three categories: Trade, Combat, and Exploration. Trading is nice for a quick mental break. It lets you sit down, listen to some calm music, and do somehting arguable productive. Combat is my most common activity. Using a small ship to take down ones that are much stronger is so satisfying (and it totally has nothing to due with the unbalanced nature of my ship). PVP is quite fun as well if you're into that. Exploration is probably my favorite part of the game. I don't know why I like it because I'm really not doing anything. However, it is like trading but way more interesting. Every time I jump into an unexplored system, I feel as though I'm gambling. I'm hoping that I'll find some incredible system with six black holes orbiting each other with neutron stars nearby each with multiple Earthlikes orbiting each one. That sounds impossible (because it totally is) but jumping from star to star keeps me excitied to see what I'll see next. Thoughts like those is what makes exploration so much fun for me. It's all a mystery and it comes together in a nice way. Who knows? Maybe I'll find some Thargoid tech...       Story    Yeah, there isn't a set one but I don't care. To be entirely honest, this is the first time that a game that has said, 'You create the story,' has really done that for me. I have created my story. I turned to a life of piracy only to return to help fight for a system's independence. I am a great explorer that has charted the galaxy. I am a trader who has made millions sustaining and exploiting economies. I am a great bounty hunter that helped to eradicate a crime syndicate from a small system and cause a rebellion against an interstellar federation. I am a commander.     Conclusion    I hope that this review was helpful to you in some way. I picked this game up at the beginning of this year and it is one of the best games that I've ever played.

            "review_text": "The 1.4 update is the best yet (still in beta). Performance seems a lot better. Some graphical improvements as well as new sounds, such as a sonic indicator of hyperdrive cool down so that you know it is ready for use. New ships have been added too.  The star of the update is definitely the CQC mode, which is a smaller scale dogfighting mode with standard team deathmatch, deathmatch and capture the flag modes. It's fast paced, good for learning the ropes of dogfighting, and you can earn credits by playing it too, which is a nice bonus. It's the sort of mode that is great to play when you either don't have much time to play, or you are maybe tired of going from A-B trading, or you just want to hone your dogfighting skills.  The Horizons season of expansions should be coming soon, and while I think it should have been priced a bit lower (£20 loyalty discount, £30 standard, £40 for E:D and Horizons), it does seem like it will make exploration that much more immersive. It has a lot of potential, although I will be waiting to see a bunch of gameplay videos before I purchase. Initially I was disappointed by the lack of atmospheric bodies, but the amount of work that they will require will be staggering, when you consider the detail required. I can understand them coming in their own season, same with explorable space stations. At the end of the day, I would like to see it all done right.  The game is quite the time sink, and earning credits can be a slow process too. The learning curve is quite difficult and it doesn't really hold your hand at all. Earning enough to afford your first weapon/ship upgrades can be a frustrating experience, but once you do, you will be able to earn credits much more quickly.  For new players, I recommend finding a station that has repairs, outfitting, and local security contacts, that is within 5 minutes distance from a resource extraction site. If you scan ships at the RES and engage with 'wanted' ships there, you can earn bounties quite quickly, and cash them in at the near-by station. Then you can upgrade your ship/weapons, repair, etc. and be back in action in no time. Once you have about 500 grand, invest in a Cobra Mk III and outfit it, and then return to the RES and start taking on bigger ships for higher bounties. Or, alternatively, you could outfit your Cobra with a fuel scoop and more cargo capacity and start trading in rare goods to make money more quickly (but less interesting).  It's a very well made game, but you can burn yourself out on it. Thankfully the CQC mode offers a completely different flavour of gameplay though. Very welcome.",

It is so well optimised running fixed at 60fps even in combat.  Add me if you like. But dont ask me how to dock 'cos I still dont have a clue  LASER BEEEAAAMZZZ PEWPEWPEWPEW   EDIT: 100+ hours now, so i've expected the dust to settle and the novelty to wear off a bit. I learned how to dock also.   However I just cant stop finding things that have me grinning like a bloody idiot for 20 minutes;   The unique thruster sounds of all the different ships (the Fer De Lance sounds insane!) or the fact that everytime you enter a stations orbit, the flight controller calls you by your ship and first three letters of your IGN phonetically, landing on an unknown planet in the middle of a nebula and being very aware of the eerie clicking noises following you about, or the thrill of desperately trying to evade the countless police forces/pirates/players as you boost hell for leather to your docking pad trying not to get scanned as you r'e smuggling 108 tons of illegal slaves in your cargo hold.   Of course combat as a big one. I realise alot of long time players are currently upset about a recent patch that significantly buffed the AI and therefore the difficulty of the game - I can't really comment as I started playing after 2.1 so it's all I know. I do, however, find it a very welcomed challenge. Basically if the ship is bigger than yours and has the big words ELITE written under their name - dont try and solo it unless you possess some 1337 skillz.  The flight mechanics make this game - every ship feels unique and has various strengths and weaknesses. Watching a fixed laser beam literally melt lines into an enemies hull whilst landing a well timed hit with your pulse accelerator/cannon is something else.  My main gripe so far is probably the lack of direction as a newbie. I understand that you do whatever you want, but I think the game should be telling you the current and previous lore, not user youtube videos. You really need to check out the community sites to really get an idea of whats going on.  The mission system does need some fixing. Most are boring/dont work/dont pay anywhere near enough or at least offer enough story or reason to do them. (exception - smuggling but I like that play style)  Generally no problems winging up with a friend although voice comms occasionally refuses to work. However when they do, the way the game edits voices is amazing and it really does sound like you are talking over radio.  Overall I cannot recommend this game enough. The visuals/flight mechanics/sounds/vastness and freedom completetly outweigh the little irks and annoyances I have, because this is the closest you will ever be in your lifetime to actually experiencing whats out there in our galaxy.",

I will state that if you want something that is crazy fast paced this is definitly not your game as it can take quite some time to travel from system to system especially when your starting off. There are essentially a few careers that you can embark on in the game all of which have their own unique playstyle. Trader, explorer, bounty hunter, miner, or just basic misions. What you do is completely up to you and you can outfit your ship to carry on multiple roles as well. From the amount of time that I have played the game there is no one career that really makes that much more money than the other so it all winds down to what you prefer to do the most. Therefore I would recommend buying this game as there is a lot of stuff to explore and do in there. Plus its always cool when you buy a shiny new ship. I would not recommend this game if you are expecting non stop action all the time. You can find zones that contain this type of action but your not going to get it starting off and your not going to want to do it unless you join one of the in game factions. Also a little tip, the system you start off in, your going to want to get away from there as fast as possible as there are a lot of people on there that are looking for noobs to slaughter.",

            "review_text": "-- UPDATE 2 -- It's at this time that I'm really, really sad. I've made a stupid decision. I spent 10 hours making 10mil to get enough money to upgrade from a Python to Type9 fully kitted to trade. Then I got the type9, really excited, took screenshots of the new interior just as I always do when I get a new ship. Then I bought my upgrades. Then I launched out of the pad. And then I tried my hardest to fly. Holy hell. I tried harder. Holy crap my grandma could probably walk faster on her cane in comparison to the speed of this ship boosting. I finally make my way outside, and I already know what's going to happen. I make it to the station that I have to end up selling my stuff in and then take about 7-10 minutes to land because I ended up on the wrong side of the port. After selling everything, I sell the interiors and then the ship and rebuy my old ship. I lost 10 mil. Which means I lost 10 hours.  I quit the game and opened up YouTube and am now watching Elite Dangerous trading and pirating videos as I type this. At least I learned a lesson: Python &gt; Type9 cringe-worthy agility. Perhaps next time I'll watch some gameplay of those ships lol - Goes to show how great this game is, though. I spent 10 hours to get a new ship, got it, hated it, sold it, lost 10 hours, and still love this game and plan to play it again immediately after waking up.  10mil/10hours would be stupid again  -- UPDATE 1 -- Decided to go try out pirating myself. Forgot to scan the ship I interdicted. Killed it on accident because I forgot to target the cargo bay. It dropped cargo worth only ~500Cr. Pick it up anyway because better than nothing. Didn't notice that Security Forces dropped out of their Friendship Drive to check me out.

The Bad: -Hard to grasp what's going on in the greater universe.  -Bugs sometimes reduce immersion. -Mission types could be expanded.  Other Thoughts: -Game treats you like an adult. Much of the meta game is hidden from view. Makes it hard to get what you want. But it is rewarding if/when you figure it out. -Game still being developed; not just balance tweaks but full blown changes. So far these changes have been free but the developer is cryptic about sharing a vision or way ahead. A road map would be nice. -Overall the game is very much worth the money in its current state.

Get a nice ship, a big-enough fuel-tank, a fuel-scoop and the best jump-drive (a so-called Frame-Shift Drive) and get onto a journey to the centre of the galaxy!  Exploring not your trade?

Have a good route and you'll make that dosh hand over fist in no time! It's basically Euro Truck Simulator, but in space!*  Both of that sounds meh to you? You're more of the 'I WANNA SHOOT STUFF AND MAKE THEM EXPLODE!' kinda guy? Well, don't worry! Buy a nimble or heavy fighter - it's up to you!** - and go hunt those pesky pirates for renown and their bounty! Or if you're of the naughty kind and maybe just want to watch the galaxy burn you can be a pirate yourself!***  So what's holding you up? If you loved games like Freelancer, you sure won't dislike this! The devs are also nicely at work to add more and more features as the months pass by, so support is going very well!  * Occassional attacks by pirates possible. ** Heavier ships subject to higher credit-costs - all in-game credits though, no real money advantage items! *** Piracy condemned by the Federation, Empire and Alliance; be aware of jurisdictal issues including physical harm and/or death",

There's one thing that Elite: Dangerous shows it's that space is BIG.  Graphically ED has gone from strength to strength. Recent additions include stunning pulsar stars and the awesome little ship launched fighters. Add to that the new passenger missions and other improvements to the whole mission system can leave new players feeling a little lost to begin with. Thankfully there are plenty of Zero-PVP communities out there in which new players can learn the ropes and find a guide to wing up with while learning the ropes.  One of the key sales lines of ED was 'Blaze your own trail' - and you certainly can. Play how you want to play, if you want to trade then trade, mine asteroids if you want, smuggle illegal goods, take part in the political power struggle between the ruling factions or remain independant. You can choose what to do, there is no set path to any ultimate goal, no end-game to reach and then get bored with. This very lack of an end game leads some to feel there is no point to the game and they miss out on the fact that the whole point is just to play and have fun.

Not ideal, but nothing a little tweaking can't solve.    I can now fully reccomend the game. It deserves every bit of priase it can get. Full 1.1 replica map of our Galaxy, and thounsands of missions to do at every sector. Flying is satisfying, and gives great feedback (reccomend a joystick or HOTAS), and combat is challenging, and immersive.

It has so much potential, and is incredibly fun to play, yet it crashes all the time. And beffore the downvotes start raining in, I am not the only one with the issue I address. Seems like most users on the game that have nVidia cards have the same problems as well.  The short end of it is, it keeps crashing. My system EXCEEDS the recommended requirements, yet, I get an error that DirectX or the nVidia drivers have crashed roughly 10-30 minutes into playing.   Forums have no solutions, though it seems I am not the only one with this issue. When the game plays, it plays fantastic. However, so far it has been disappointing to only play in small increments, before having to reload. Buy with caution, knowing there could be problems with crashing.

            "review_text": "Simply awesome graphics, physics and experience.   OK.. now that i have 3000 hours on record.. im going to do a full review on this.  Personally for me, ED is a good game to keep coming back to from time to time. Initially, you start off as a nobody and the learning curve is steep. This game is a grind (like many others in these categories) and you need to keep at the grind to get where you want to be. Many will give up especially without help. Initially you need to just get yourself familiar with the environment and play around. Then to really get anywhere you will need to socialise a bit with players around you. Join up with respectable/knowledgeable clans with good experience and they will help point you in the right direction for a faster climb. There are essentially three routes to choose from to ascend the ladder from rags to riches. Combat/Trading/Exploring. Which you choose depends on what you enjoy doing.   Combat: Missions and missions. Grind through missions collecting credits and reputation and upgrade your ships. I know of people who have done nothing but combat to accumulate billions of credits in their accounts. Its doable but again its a grind.  Exploration: Pick a direction and a star 1000LY away and head there. Initially, missions and bounty hunting will be your grind until you can muster enough credits to outfit your ship for the long distance haul. Once there, you fly point to point scanning stars and planets and occasionally if you feel like it, land on a non-atmospheric and look for materials or do some photography. My favourite for exploration is the photography. How the stars and planets can be seen, how lights fall across the different terrains and how lonely we actually are in this single galaxy.  Trading/trucking: Find profitable routes and grind your way to the ultimate money making vehicle. Trading is probably the most consistent money making scheme you will find here but it can be boring like hell if you do an A/B route. Some people do A/B/C/D/E/A just to break the monotony.   Once your money making endeavours have had some fruits of success, you will want to try your hand in PVP. Basically player vs player combat from one on one to multiple wings and big engagements. This is where all the fun is at but its a very expensive sport. Every time you die, you need to pay for a rebuy and if you dont have credits for your rebuys, you end up in the starting ship. Back to square one. PvP can be agreed upon or it can be spontaneous and deadly. Know what you are getting yourself into if you encounter a hostile player. Sometimes its better to do a runner than to lose your entire progress in the game.  With the introduction of engineers 2.1, they have implemented ship upgrades so now you have a customisable and relatively unique (in the sense that nobody knows your configuration) ship whereas in the past, there were only that many useful configurations in ship builds. It certainly adds a new dimension where if you had a big ♥♥♥ ship in the past, you were likely to win a battle against a smaller one but now small ships if properly upgraded can be just as deadly.   As im writing this, ive just returned from a break from the game (4-6 months) due to a family crisis but now that things are back to a routine, its back to passing time amongst the 400 billions star systems. I was on an expedition called the Distant World Expedition to a system 65,000LY away and had to cut out half way so im making my way back to civilisation. Ive not yet had time to grind for the Engineers' upgrade yet.   This is certainly a game that wont be deleted from my computer anytime soon but thats for me. For some it may not be up to their expectations because of the grind or they may prefer following a specific storyline. All in all, my tip to really enjoying the game, is to find yourself a clan with a teamspeak server and blaze your way with others by your side (at least you wont be so lonely in the vastness of space).",

            "review_text": "I don't usually write reviews because I'm lazy. I have steam to play games.  But I have to say this is one of the most awesome experiences I have had in a while. Here's the thing about space. It's big. And it's mostly empty. So yes, there is a lot of time you're sitting around wishing you could play tetris on a side screen or eat a sandwich or something while waiting for your ship to arrive at it's destination. However, this is not a game you can just walk away from. It doesn't work like that. The world is alive, and it cares not for your high score or sandwiches.  I have not played on the multiplayer mode so this is purely a single player experience, but here's a rundown of how it went. Note: Every other thing involved in this scenario was an NPC, not a player.  So I'm floating along, and pick up an unidentified signal source. I'm figuring I might get lucky so I pop in to check it out. As I arrive, there's a wreckage with some containers with two ships (presumably pirates) warping out. So I check out the containers and they have some prototype tech in them. I figure that will sell well on the black market, so I open my scoop and pick up as much as my ship can hold. Now, this tech is illicit cargo, so I know if I don't want to get fined by the space patrol, I gotta get back to a port and offload this stuff before I get scanned. So I beline to the nearest market with my newfound goods.  Then it happens. Warning singals go crazy and my field of vision blurs. Suddenly, the warp field around my ship starts to destabilize. I'm being interdicted by something. Basically, what this means is another ship has jumped into my warp stream and is forcefully trying to knock me out of warp for some unknown purpose. I struggle to keep my ship on course but they overwhelm me and we both come tumbling forcefully out of warp. Unfortunately, I had just tried out mining so I only had one wimpy blaster at my disposal. It was a pirate and he meant to take my illgotten gains. I struggled to keep up a fight, but I was losing. Was this the end of my shipfaring days? The pirate taunts me over chat, telling me this was the last warp jump I was ever gonna make. I was screwed.  Then he sends me another message,  'I gotta get out of here!'  I'm confused. He was winning. I was about to die. Why is he leaving? He hits warp immediately and then a bit red sign flashes across my screen: 'Scan Detected'  Crap.  Apparently the space patrol had picked up the interdiction and came to investigate. They saved my life from the pirate, but then scanned my cargo bay and slapped me with a 15k credit fine for having illegal goods. I was not entirely happy with this, but it was better than being dead. Luckly, they didn't confiscate my cargo and I headed to the station and docked. Called up the black market contact and sold off my prototype tech. 18k for the lot. Would have been nicer if the 15k fine hadn't eaten up most of my profits, but you take what you can get in the cold vastness of space.  This, though. This is why I recommend the game. The world is alive. The immersion is there. Sometimes, you're just sitting around, doing nothing. It happens from time to time. And sometimes everything goes as planed. But sometimes things will blindside you and it is up to you as the commander of your vessel to deal with things as they come. If that is the feeling you want to have, I would recommend this game for you.  If you want to just pew pew baddies, then I would suggest something more arcade style, because this is a space simulator to the higest degree. Every nuance is captured and done incredibly well, even in single player mode. Interestingly enough, the AI is VERY diverse and each one you interact with seems to have different personalities.  I've had enemies panic and run when they start getting low health. I've had some self-destruct their ship before I could kill them just to prevent me from collecting my bounties (Yes, they do that!), and I've had some do some really underhanded things. I was in a warzone as a mercenary and I was chasing down this fighter. He broke away from the main fight and started to run, so I of course, kept chasing him. He was money in my pocket. It didn't dawn on me until it was too late that he was luring me into a trap. I chased him away from the battle zone and suddenly I was being assaulted by 3 other fighters who had followed us out of the main fighting area. It was now 4 on 1, I was completely outgunned and I had no choice but to run.  So far, it's been a fantastic experience all the way through. But if I can leave you with only one piece of advice, it would be this:  ALWAYS remember to request docking permission before entering port. They really hate it if you don't.",

You may scan every planet in a system but I doubt that you are earn much this way. If you prefer to explore unknown stars, go on then.

Well prices are high, and even Type 9 will require dozens trips to buy them; - Missions. They became better, but most of them are still pointless, unless you want to get a certain rank from either Empire or Federation. I doubt it is wise to carry a message to the near system for 1,5k CR when I can earn 1,2M CR per 15 min delivering goods instead.  So, it's the game with a good potential. It has a proper gameplay, but it lacks content. I believe that true pilots can accept all the weak points and have fun.",

            "review_text": "The most common complaint about Elite: Dangerous (and boy, do people complain) is that it's 'shallow' - there's very little story line (although a recent update helped that) and the whole game is just flying your spaceship around and doing things in space, which gets boring. Here's my take on that:  Elite: Dangerous does some things very well, and other things quite poorly. Most notably, while it is an excellent space sim-style game (though not properly part of what I call the 'high simulation' genre, in that it doesn't realistically model space flight or the complexity of cockpit control), it is not a strong linear-story-based RPG game. That's not a downside unless you thought you were getting a story-based RPG; for example, it's also not a FPS, a MOBA, a RTS, or a 4X, or a tower defense game, but it shouldn't get any points off for not being those things. If you want to play one of those kinds of games, you should buy one of them instead of Elite: Dangerous. If you want a simulator/sandbox game, you should buy Elite: Dangerous.  I bought this game excited to be able to fly around in a space ship, explore, see beautiful things in space, and trade things. I've done that for 200 hours and have no plan to stop any time soon.",

Dont get me wrong, this game is a bit like Marmite. You either love it or hate it.  There is no story, you are not told what to do or where to go, you are dumped in a sea of stars and have to make your own way. Personally I have been fighting in every war I can find and have amassed a small fortune in the process.  Enjoy such delights as:  * Watching new players miss the docking port and go slamming into station walls or other ships * Admiring a sun at far too close a distance and frying every component in your ship * Exploring a star system 1000's of light years away, and noticing a rather unhealthy looking crack in your canopy getting bigger * Not paying any attention to power requirements, arming your weapons, and then drifting without power through a warzone as every system on your ship shuts down * Teaming up with your friends and then getting blown to smithereens by a guy who's friends have bigger ships than yours.  It goes on. And it's all fantastic.  With the upcoming Horizons expansion at the end of the year it's set to get even better. Let's just hope it's better than the PowerPlay update, which was a bit of a damp squib.  Plus, those of us who bought Elite Dangerous about a year before it appeared on Steam requested steam keys. They delivered them. Great company that listens to its customers (Just dont mention an offline mode though, it just starts fights).  Check some youtube vids before you buy.

            "review_text": "So, I intend to write an ongoing review of this game, offering my views as I go along. To start, I am playing it on an ASUS G75VX with components as follows:  GTX670MX 3GB discrete GPU Intel i7 3630MQ CPU 32 GB Ripjaws 1600 RAM Samsung EVO 840 500 GB SSD Seagate 750 GB Hybrid HDD  VISUALS and PERFORMANCE  The game plays extremely well on my laptop. VSYNC is disabled but I see very little tearing or other visual distortions indicative that the display is out of sync. I'm seeing averages of 60 FPS at 1920 x 1080 resolution with a custom setting generated by Nvidia GEFORCE Experience. The game is gorgeous in the model detail, lighting, and textures. 10/10 for being able to create a visually immersive environment that plays very well on dated hardware.  CONTROLS and PHYSICS  I don't have a HOTAS setup; its just the trusty old keyboard and mouse for my adventures. Admittedly, this isn't an ideal configuration for those that intend to become lethal combat pilots. For the most part, I believe I fly like a modest bumblebee sort of meandering about and nearly ramming most stationary structures in my flightpath. Controls are intuitive, easy to understand, and reasonable given my method of input. Others have mentioned the nerfed yaw rates, which was done intentionally by Frontier to prevent spinning in place death matches, and it does seem odd that spacecraft have such freedom of movement are unable to rotate around their Y-axis at the same rates. Not a big deal, but noticeable for those that are accustom to flight models in Kerbal Space Program.   Speaking of which, the flight models are definitely on the arcadey side and that's a good thing. If this simulator used anything approaching true Newtonian physics, no one would be docking, taking off, or landing anywhere. All there would be is smoking rubble all over the game where people boffed some small approach vector or miscalculated their delta-vee. Gravity is present, as are orbits (from what I can see), along with FTL systems. Frameshift engines is how this game solves the massive expanses of the void. It's loosely based on the Alcubierre Drive, but doesn't deal with conservation of momentum like a real one would. Again, this is a good thing. Timing seems to be a big part of successfully negotiating use of this engine as a missed exit from supercruise will likely end with a delay where you must turn around, wait for the drive to cooldown, re-enter supercruise and attempt your approach again.  GAMEPLAY  So far I don't have much to report here. I've completed my first mission which primarily involved a very lengthy ascent from a planet's surface trying to get enough distance to attain line of sight with a frameshift destination obscured by the planet I was taking off from. This maneuver highlights the scale of this game; the planetoid I took off from was MASSIVE. If there were items of interest hidden anywhere on this gigantic ball in space, I would never know it. The size was far greater than anything I would care to try and explore.  All in all, right now I would recommend ED:Horizons for the price point offered. The big selling point here is that the scale is comparable to NMS (400 billion to 18 sextillion may seem like a massive difference, and it is but both are so comically huge that it doesn't make a difference), there seems to be something tangible to do rather than wandering around (but you can do that if you want to), and it is very accessible from a hardware standpoint.   I'll update this review frequently as I discover more aspects of the game.  UPDATE:  I've completed a few more missions and I am really hooked on this game. The grindy feel is there, no doubt, but I feel like the adventure of trying different approaches overcomes that. Yes, you can endlessly trade junk between stations if you're trying to safely (mostly) make coin but there are plenty of other missions available to the bolder sort. I highly recommend this game. It is a fun way to spend your time and can be managed in small chunks for the time impaired folks out there.",

Also, if you want non-stop combat this might not be the game for you. Bounty Hunting can get pretty hectic, but requires patience. The impatient can simply find a conflict zone and fight there, but they'll die without a half decent ship. I love trading because it gives me a chance to catch up on podcasts, listen to music and sketch while I'm jumping etc. Don't believe the people saying 'It's grindy nonsense' because they aren't playing the game to it's fullest extent and aren't looking for ther game's best content.

To start with, this game is a space sim, not an easily mastered arcade game like No Mans Sky. If you don't want to be faced with an extremely steep learning curve in an unforgiving galaxy followed by a bill for loads of random bits and pieces to make the game easier to play, then it probably isn't for you.   If however, you like the thought of slowly mastering the controls of your very own spaceship in order to fly around carving out a tiny and insignificant future for yourself in an enormous galaxy full of pirates, bounty hunters, traders and mysterious objects; then this game is definitely for you.   Minimum specs are practically pointless in this game. For me, it's all about immersion. Do you need a decent rig, a nice 144hz g-sync monitor, a HOTAS and a TRACKIR to play Elite Dangerous?! Absolutely not, but I can tell you that it's going to be 10x better if you've got them. To clarify, playing with a keyboard is perfectly possible but difficult to master and playing with an Xbox controller again is perfectly possible but fairly limiting.  I started with a controller but I soon got carried away so I now have a chair that I've attached a HOTAS to along with head tracker that really helps to make me feel like I'm in the game which in my opinion is really important.   On day 1 of playing, I was lucky enough to meet a very kind player in the open galaxy who decided not to rob me but to instead take some time out of his day to teach me the basics and throw me some loot to sell for ship upgrades. I thought that was pretty weird at first but now that I've been a bit more involved with the games community, I'm not at all surprised.  Yeah, there are griefers looking to steal your loot and blow you to oblivion but there are also factions dedicated to helping out noobs in order to retain players and build up the games community. There are also groups of scientists dedicated to exploring the galaxy's vastness and tracking down and understanding its plethora secrets. Then there's the Wolf of Wall Street trading system and the constant community goals which in my limited experience seem to aim to further the story.   That leads me nicely to the simple plot; we're not alone in the galaxy.   Having said that, the devs point blank refuse to spoon feed us so we've got to work hard and think outside the box to keep the story moving.   Sometimes it can be a grind but only if you let it be... Most of the time, it's awesome fun!  That's my last point, fun. This isn't a linear story. This is a space sim. 9 times out of 10 you have to make your own fun.   TL;DR: 10/10 because spaceships.",

Combat feels seamless and trading is fun. A true play-your-way open world adventure. If you're gonna pick this up, I reccomend purchasing a flightstick and making an Awesome Mix playlist before you begin plying the spaceways. Also, if you want non-stop combat this might not be the game for you. Bounty Hunting can get pretty hectic, but requires patience. The impatient can simply find a conflict zone and fight there, but they'll die without a half decent ship. I love trading because it gives me a chance to catch up on podcasts, listen to music and sketch while I'm jumping etc. Don't believe the people saying 'It's grindy nonsense' because they aren't playing the game to it's fullest extent and aren't looking for ther game's best content.  EDIT: I don't care that the DLC strategy is screwing me over. I payed the original price and I feel like I've got my money's worth for that price (I played this before this came to Steam). Unlike most of the reviews, I understand that great content takes money to develop and I'm willing to support the developers. Buy Horizons when it comes out, I'll probably buy it on a sale.",

It's supposed to be difficult.  Conclusion: This is a great game with a huge community of factions, etc. I'd recommend getting this game if you have ever played the other Elite games in the past and liked them. It is hard to get started in the game and It's not for a casual gamer but once you have a gotten another ship orientated to what you want to do, it's a lot of fun.",

I have played this game for not long, I have decent ship, and seen many things in this game. I find that this game is all of the things that a space combat/exploration game should be, but it does neeed more content in it for some parts. But enough blabin, to the pros/cons.  Pros: 1: Huge galaxy to explore 2: Always somthing happening, weather it be an battle, or having to transport goods. 3: Absolutly bueatiful. 4: A decent simulator, still have some arcady bits. 5: Very optimized 6: More to than just combat 7: Wings. Being able ot play with freinds in a game like this is awsome. 8: Very open world (Only places you can't enter are planets, which will be added, andstars. Other than that, you can practically go anywhere.) 9: Very fun when action happens 10: Semi-real damage system 11: You can go either single or multiplayer 12: Lots more that I can't name off the top of my head.\\  Cons: 1: This game can be a BORE, when you are warping around the same places, or just waiting for a freind, or grinding 2: The grind................................ There is alot of it 3: The multiplayer part... Don't get me wrong, I love multiplayer, however, pvp, harrassment, hackers, and other lovely people being around isn't my cup of tea. 4: Wanted system, slightly brocken, brilliant system, but it is sorta easy to get one, and the only way to loose the bounty is by dying. 5: $60... Should be aroung 30, but get it when it is 30, lower than that, or at least around 45. 6: Other things I can't name off the top of my head.  Other than those, I love this game, its fun with freinds, and if can get over the grinding and the occasional bore you get with it, then you will love this game.

They make you watch video's rather than hold your hand as they teach you things. But it's cool.  For instance; Just Docking the first time feels like an accomplishment. And i still enjoy performing a perfect landing at this point. Although i imagine it gets old, i'll admit to that.  Getting a new ship after making the credits for it feels awesome. The game made you work for it, but that's part of the fun. Then using that ship to blow away pirates or criminals is great. While also making you more money for an even better ship, or a better load out for the one ship you fell in love with.    ",

Once I'm comfortable, I'll go on an exploration trip to some famous stars and see what a Wolfe-Rayet star looks like, or a Carbon star or who knows what else.   Each ship has its own personality, areas it's useful and how you feel inside it.  Each career choice (and you are not locked into any one of them) feels drastically different.  Credits aren't too hard to come by and you always have a choice between a few different types of ships.  Missions can be varied, pay well and require you to rank up your combat/trading/exploration standings.  At the moment it's far more worth it to join the Empire for the Courier and Clipper.  The Powerplay is a little intrigueing, it's been out for a week and already my power got promoted to second in galaxy.   The pace of this game is rather slow, so be ready for that.

There are so many things to do and explore I just find myself somewhere I have never seen after a couple of jumps. You can be Whatever you want, and do it however you want. Add that to all the ships you can find and purchase, you've got yourself a fantastic adventure.  Now The game does have some downsides. First off the learning curve may be too much for someone not used to a challenge, but if you can get past it you'll be fine the rest of the game. I reccomend a expierenced friend to help you start. The Servers are less than ideal at times currently. Some times the ingame groups or wings will bug out making your wing partner invisible to you. At other times the server might be under some stress and your game will perform poorly, this can be fixed by playing solo, but its only half the expierence.  This game is absolutly amazing. If your a solo player looking for a good challenge and you like some Space Travel, then Elite: Dangerous is the game you need to get. On a side note Joysticks are comletely optional and you will find your self to be a competitive pilot with both mouse and joystick, however I will say a joystick adds to the fun.",

If you don't want to smash your monitor out of frustration, take at least an hour or two (literally) to read up or watch videos on basics of how to play. Take some time setting up your flight controls to where you're comfortable.  Once you're up and running smoothly, there will still be things to figure out, but the amazing depth of Elite: Dangerous is perhaps what makes it so addictive. Soon enough you'll be shopping for new ships, upgrading components, and (if you're into such things) you can even tweak your ship's system management to get a few extra ounces of power/efficiency.  Between making profitable freight runs, collecting bounties on pirates, and mining asteroids for precious minerals, you'll probably spend a good amout of time just admiring the beauty of space.

Like I said before, there is nothing you can't do.   And, if this game wasn't awesome enough already, the devs are still adding on to it, in fact, a pretty big update is coming out next week.

A smooth simulation of a fantastic banality of the future. This was in the tutorial.  The universe of Elite has captured me deeply. At times I have ground my way through trading, bounty hunting or exploration, and admittedly these activities become chores if I were to stare at the credits or rank I was earning. Even so, my trip to Bernards Loop, motivated by raising my rank and earning sweet space dollars, has given me something more than any game before. I have exited a station, stopping in my tracks at the sight of a great red loop in the sky that I once have visited, feeling a strange connection to a simulated nebula in a simulated sky, thousands of simulated light years away.  Now, I have abandoned my quest for the biggest ships and the highest ranks. I will earn this in time, but not through tedious repetition. My time in Elite is spent on being there - sticking to a corner of inhabited space, where other commanders come and go, taking in the sights, shooting people I disagree with and trading with those I like. Besides, anyone who has spent his hundreds of hours trading and grinding pirate bounty for a fat Anaconda wouldn't hold up against my Vulture.  On top of this, the background fiction of the world of Elite is fantastic, moved along by player formed pirate groups or trading companies, news feeds and community goals. Despite not yet being a truly dynamic system (but with the Powerplay around the corner, let's hope it will be), I inhabit a living world narrated by the intrigues of Federal democracy, the struggle for the Imperial throne and Aisling's blue hair.  Elite: Dangerous is delivering an amazing and complete experience. The promises that the developers have for the future of the game are unbelievable, but so is the sheer scale and quality of the world they have build already.",

It's extremely fun, the things to see are unlimited, and the Dev team for E:D is constantly striving to improve things as well as add new features to the game. I really can't say enough good stuff about this game, honestly. It's so well done overall and I'm always eager to see what the Devs are talking about, or considering bringing in next.  The only things I strongly advise is:  1. DO THE TRAINING MISSIONS. The learning curve in this game can be pretty harsh.  2. Always, ALWAYS have money for a rebuy. It sucks balls coming up short especially when you've worked hard enough to get into the nicer ships.  3. K.G.B. FOAM is your best friend. These are the stars you can fuel off of (K, G, B, F, O, A, M). And they've now implimented a means of routing your path using specific star types. I strongly suggest this for long trips especially in ships that don't have a particularly large jump range.  There is so much to this game. But the main thing is - be patient. Be it with learning, or travel, or what have you. This game requires a lot of it. And it's also fairly unforgiving which is why I mentioned the rebuy thing.  Honestly there's just so much to take in about this game, but it's truly a blast once you get over the initial learning curve. I also strongly recommend popping onto twitch.tv and visiting others playing the game. You'll learn a lot by watching them do trade, pirating, illegal transport, transporting people, combat, etc. And don't be shy about asking questions. The community for this game is awesome, and more often than not, people will be happy to help.  Gonna plug a friend here:  twitch.tv/lavangfan  is someone who helped me out.

I got bored with mission running and decided I wanted to bounty hunt. So, I get myself a Viper Mark III, and eventually a track down a system that has a pretty close station to a High Resource Extraction site (a place where miners will come and no doubt be hit by pirates, perfect for bounty hunting). I start out making decent cash, and get cordial with a few different powers in the system. One of them, I noticed, was in a bit of a predicament.  They're called Social Taunisla Labour, a small democratic faction of workers, and they were engaged in civil war with one of the systems major corporations. It was costing them, and the other faction proudly boasted about how they were expecting to win. Beat upon by the man, the workers continued to do their best, and before I knew it I found myself swept up with trying to help them, despite the costs it incurred to me. I'd bounce back and forth between bounty hunting to maintain my credit balance while helping them out, and things are still looking grim, but at least progress is being made.  One day, while bounty hunting, I got a message from my contact with Social Labour. He told me some military plans had been lost that were vital to the war, and requested that I head out to retrieve them. I finished up my bounties, made my way out there, and was able to recover the lost plans with a salvaging up. Once I got back, my contacts face lit up, and another blow was dealt to the corporate oppressors of the system.  The thing about Elite: Dangerous is that stories like this are happening all around you every day. The commentary is so dryly written, however, that the stories are easy to miss if you aren't really paying attention. At first glance, two factions are engaged in civil war. Yawn. A bit deeper of a look, however, and you'll realize the truth of the matter: a corporation beating the working man into submission, that desperately needs help and has nowhere to get it.  I really think these story elements could have a bit more lipstick put on to them and get gussied up, the way NPCs speak to you right now seems so dry and bland that there's no personality--it's all listed objectives and the meaning and purpose behind this has to be extrapolated by the player, but these stories are still there, when you open your eyes and take a gander at them.  The flight mechanics are incredibly fun, once you get the hang of them. I invited my friend over to play and compared it to learning to drive--other games I've played, you just speed to the max and try to get better at pulling of slick moves (which are obtainable to perform, thanks to those games mechanics), but in Elite you actually learn when to and need to slow down to make that tight turn or to sweep into the docking bay of a station. Of course, some pilots can still do it faster than others, so a skill ceiling is still there, and mine rises every day.  The combat is good in a lot of ways, though sometimes I find myself a bit bored by NPCs zipping circles around me such that I never really am able to get my crosshairs on them--I've run out of ammo in my multicannons before busting shields before. That said, multicannons are terrible for busting shields, and honestly I'm not that skilled at combat yet. My lack of success really doesn't make me give the game a sour expression, it just makes me feel like it's more of the same I've come to expect from Elite: you don't just dive into it, you have to really learn and 'get good' to be successful, which is something I respect about the game.  This game completely takes the cake graphically, however. The cockpits and stations and planets are so well designed (even by a computer) that you can't help but get lost in the game. It's easy to imagine that you really are a pilot in space, navigating the stars to carve out your own fortune. While every other solid point I've spoken about in the game has an area that needs improvement, this isn't one of them. No pun intended, it's stellar.  Elite: Dangerous is one of the best games to come out in a long time, in it's current state AND beyond (no Beta excuses for it coming from me), and I can't wait to see how much more impressive it becomes as the little kinks and issues get ironed out.",

If only for this game's amazing flight physics and the super immersive 'being in space' atmosphere, and just for that alone it's worth to get it! But I cannot just end on that, need to talk about 'things to do': it's all grind missions, unless you keep convincing yourself through a vibrant imagination that it's not.  I def enjoyed the 200hrs+ I have, why? Because I kept imagining the great things I will discover and spend money on as I progress, that kept me going and I thought I was actually progressing towards some great things. As everyone knows, I also knew that this game doesn't 'hold your hand' so there must be tons of things todo that are just not obvious - I had absolute confidence there are great/new things to be discovered so I kept going having fun progressing towards my imaginary soon, soon, soon to be discovered interesting things. But as I went on, I found nothing new, nothing new, nothing new.  It didn't take too long to get my favorite fully modified mid-sized ship, and I don't want to upgrade to a bigger ship because they are all slower - so now I have $35M+ accumulating and I have absolutely NOTHING to do with it....So I don't need money anymore for my style of ship, and since missions and fighting only give more money, I just don't need to grind anymore either. So only thing left to do is go visit planets and pretend to yourself they look different then the ones you saw before.  Now I have no reasons to come back anymore. There is only so long that I can pretend something fun is going to happen, there is only so much I can force myself to imagine that I am making a difference in the universe. Absolutely nothing is going to change, 80% of the gameplay time is spent hopping from system to system and decelerating towards a station. And 20% fighting which is absolutely the same experience everytime, I don't feel ANY difference between running away from a fight or fighting the enemy, the result is identical, I get nothing more or less from fighitng vs running, only money which I don't need anymore.",

There are a lot of different ways to earn money, but depending on your patience, very few of them will feel like they are giving you enough for the time you are investing. You'll find endless youtube videos on 'Fastest Credits,' which is a sign of this issue in the game. Would not recommend simply using mouse and keyboard, as it's pretty awkward since it's essentially a flight-sim game. If you don't have a joystick and throttle, just use an xbox controller, it'll feel quite natural once you set up the controls how you like.

I really never get tired of exploring the galaxy and seamlessly flying from space to planet is always fun.   On the other hand, there are complex systems that drive the factions, politics, and ownership of stations that don't always behave predictably. The game offers little-to-no handholding, which is nice if you're a fan of older games with high learning curves. However, the UI is garbage and most mission rewards don't pay equally. The devs seem to be engaged in a cycle of 'introduce mechanic,' -&gt; 'players exploit mechanic' &gt; 'devs nerf mechanic' (Sothis runs, Fed/Imperial rank grinding, etc).   Overall, I'd recommend this game. It's a ton of fun to fly through an asteroid field with friends, picking targets for bounties, and getting into hectic dogfights.

            "review_text": "Introduction/Overview: Elite: Dangerous is, simply, a better game than the original, and not because technology has changed or graphics have improved. It is bigger, allowing for more ships, more upgrades, and more clearly distinguished playing options. Do I want to be an ethical bounty hunter, or is money the first concern? Are there types of cargo I won't carry? Do I want to explore the universe and simply be left alone? These are only a very few of the choices you will need to make for yourself in this game. These choices will also guide ship selection and outfitting, as you attempt to accomplish your goals. The conflict among the various factions within the game is also affected by the choices the player community makes, giving a dynamic universe where ethical and career choices make a difference for more than just the individual.  Gameplay:  A player is ranked in three different aspects: combat (just like original Elite), exploration, and trade. Each is levelled based upon criteria which is well documented on some of the user forums, and your respective levels will dictate what missions are available to you. There are also major factions, sub-groups within those factions, and even lesser groups, creating another level of complexity, as mission availability is also dependant upon a player’s standing with the faction hiring. Of course, you can ditch missions entirely, and freelance as you see fit. Docking is easier than the original, though a computer is still available to assist. The space station interface, while sometimes slow and fairly bare bones is fairly straight forward. Spaceship control was a total Delorian-warp. With the keyboard mapped like the first Elite, the gameplay is mostly similar to the original, though this time auto-aiming laser and projectile weapons are available, though at some loss damage potential. Different ships will have different optimum handling and max speeds, and be directly and indirectly affected by how you equip the ship. Different weapons have pros and cons, and throughout compromises are required, but in a good way. Do I want max firepower, and manage heat build up manually? Do I want to sacrifice some speed and jump range for better sensors or shields? So many choices…  For flying, there are 3 modes to be aware of: sub-light speed where combat takes place, in-system FSD (frame shift drive) which allows for travelling between locations within a solar system in a manageable amount of time, and system to system FSD. Once you mess around a bit, it will make sense, though it is easy to overshoot on an in-system FSD run. The tutorials are your friend… Possibly the most frustrating part of the gameplay is the near lack of any details on ship upgrades. How much better are A5 thrusters over D4? What advantages are there between different FSD interdiction systems, for example? In broad terms, it is pretty obvious, but the lack of any concrete numbers makes it challenging to make finely tuned decisions. Again, there is information in the user forums if you look around, and which is extremely helpful. With most other games like E:D, however, this data is more clearly given in-game.  Technical aspects: On a technical level, Elite: Dangerous is very good. You can customize the control interface, which is helpful. The graphics are somewhere between decent (Macbook Pro with 'good' integrated graphics) to very good (real graphics card). The flight model feels like it works. The AI in combat can be a bit dumb at times, like many games, but the open universe takes care of some of that. There are occasional glitches, at least on the Mac version, where the mouse pointer disappears, for example. At times, things like requesting docking by scrolling through a couple screens can feel needlessly involved, where a simple hotkey to invoke such a commonly needed command would seem to be more logical. Overall, the technical aspects of the game seem polished, and I haven’t experienced any crashes. The glitches and interface quirks are an annoyance, but not a major hinderance to gameplay.  Conclusion: I lost a good chunk of my junior high years to the Commodore 64 version of Elite, trying to max my rank. In those days, 'open sandbox' wasn't a concept I recall being talked about. My friends and I simply loved Elite because we could blow stuff up and define ourselves as we wanted. Besides original Elite, I faced addictions, at different times, to Gunship (Apache helicopter sim), Auto Duel (Elite with cars), several Wing Commander and Privateer variants, Freelancer, every Civilization game released, and, of course, both WoW and Skyrim (sadly this is only a partial list). Saying this, is Elite: Dangerous better than all those listed? Comparing it to Civ or Wow is unfair and makes no sense; they are completely different games. Better than Wing Commander series, Galaxies on Fire and/or Freelancer? The only caution I would give is E:D is MUCH more wide-open, as opposed to the regular plot nudges you get with the other space sims listed. Otherwise, E:D is vastly superior. In many ways, E:D feels like Skyrim, just from a different perspective.  Best game ever? Not a fair question. Best space sim/rpg to date? I think so.",

An in-game economy that ebbs and flows based on player activity. a galactic power struggle that you can partake in...or not. It's up to you. From what I've seen a mature player-base. (yay)-  So this is pretty much pure sandbox. Here's a ship...there's the galaxy...go! My only beef right now is the mission system, but from what I'm reading about a soon-to-be-released update the missions will be getting a revamp of sorts.   The reports of a steep learning curve are true. Do the tutorials and keep a notepad handy for jotting down key mapping and you'll be fine. YT is full of help too.  ",

The combat is great, the missions can be repetitive, but a lot of different outcomes, rewards, fights, etc.  Flying around is great too since the game is just soooooooo huge.  CQC is fun, TDM or FFA short space battles, in which credits you own go to your universal account for normal MP.   Overall, for the price, this game is great.

The same shape of (some of) the stations the same tune (Blue Danube) when docking. Same facilities of mining, picking up goods in space, fuel scoop and so on. JUST MANY TIMES BETTER NOW! Fantastic graphics and I could carry on for a long time. BUT it is so addictive that you MUST BE carefull.

I still to this day play games like Decent freespace 2 from 1998. (one of the best single player space shooters ever!)  The game, first off this game reminds me a lot of the game i mentioned above and another one called edge of chaos independence war 2 (realy old game, but good for it's time) There are many of the ideas and systems, that are also in this game. The most common are pirating, bounty hunting, trading, exploration and faction warfare. There is mining in this game but atm, this is not really viable :'(  Important! This game has a realy insane learning curve when you start. And the in game guides are realy bad! big minus in my opinion, but the communety is a big help when it comes to learning the game. When you start, use youtube and the wiki guides. You need to remember that credits are your lvl in elite, so dont fly your ship, if you cant afford the insurance. It's only the sidewinder that well always be free :-) So practice with it!  Game balance, Ships and equipment seams to be balanced really well when it comes to power and size. How ever the missions in this game doesn't really give you a good reward. even with good standing to the faction that is active on that station. This makes elite a game where you have to do some grinding, because you have to bounty hunt or do hauling of good from station to station. Just to get better equipment and ships.  Pve, is great fun in this game. Even if i feal like im missing an option to hire npc wingmen. I am still having great fun with it and for the most npc are not total nut jobs :-D The only place where they realy fail is when npc's try to dock at the stations, i dont know what's up with that but holy hell! fix plx, and dont always trust your autopilot!  Pvp, the instance based system workes realy great to simulate a space full of life. There are still some bugs that needs to get fixed with it. But it workes, and that realy makes me heappy :-) Space fighting is great!  Final verdict, is a must buy in my opinion if you like space games. Is it perfect, no. But they are still working hard on getting bugs fixed and making new free content. Just to mention this, in a week there will be coming a content patch with new ships and a lot of balancing to the game.  hopeful wishes for the future of this game. Add more equipment, ships and make player factions real! Add npc wingmann for hire, a reality! And for the love of god! stop calling hyperspace or warp, frameshift drive o.0 what is that even!  have some great fun and fly safe :-)",

This game gets tense even though a lot of the situations can be as simple as running low on fuel. It looks brilliant, and often goes from being quite relaxing - with what I think is an excellent soundtrack - to moments of sudden tension.   The sheer scale of the map (the entire galaxy) is ridiculous, and holds so many opportunities for players for things to do, and if we can get planetary landings in the future, this game could be one of the best space games ever made, in my opinion.  Definitely worth the money if you enjoy a game that switches between the laidback approach to suddenley very tense moments, and if you love space simulators, I can't recommend this enough.  When the VIVE and Oculus rift are fully released, this game will likely be one of the best for them, I think.  The learning curve is fairly steep but shouldn't take long to get past.

I can't really explain why, maybe because by then i learned all the crucial elements and did not felt confused anymore, AND BELIEVE ME, you will be confused a lot, because this game IS HUGE, AND I MEAN IT. There's tons of tons of stuff to learn about it.   This game is basically a space MOBA, there's a lot of learning, a lot of grinding, but at the end, you get attached to it so hard that you play it everyday. (At least in my case)  So enough about that. What i really like about Frontier at least in elite dangerous, is that, they stick to science and does not go too far in fiction. I mean, yeah sure, hyperdrives ? FTL travel ? Yeah right.. Ok ok, if you think about it, all those things could be possible one day, it's not guaranteed, but they do make sense, and in the game, almost every element is based on a real scientific theory or reality.  Another thing... is the sound design, hands down, I mean it, HANDS DOWN, the best sound design i have ever seen in a video game, i cannot explain it, it's just terrific.  Updates do take a while, seriously.... they do take forever... but they are worth it, this game is slowly and slowly getting better. Updates won't dissapoint, i can promise you that, but don't look for frequent updates, AT LEAST for the gameplay.  What i also like is the powerplay and all, human forces are debating ! Every force has it's own visions, you can pledge your alliance to a force or faction if you wish. You don't need to, but you get rewards if you do. (depends on which faction)  That, makes the game very alive, to see that there is really stuff going on out there, systems at war, people dying over control, pirates breathing down your ship full of cargo, bounty hunters always on the look out for wanted, and explorers, discovering the wonders of this galaxy.  Conclusion ? I don't know, there's thousand things i missed, and i really do not wish to type all the elements of the game here, im sure some other review already done it. Again, conclusion ? It's epic. yeah, thats my conclusion.",

Trading stuff for money.   In Ellie Dangaronpa it's all about the money, exploration is near non existant, you can sight see the stars, which really is cool and all but there is little to discover in this still in development game. The cool stuff has yet to be added. You can't discover and alien race and then proceed to learn anything about them other than that if you sh00t them they drop l00t for you to s3ll.  What Eloy donjerus does well is be a space sim. You can be a trader, trading from system to system making all the big creds, whilst running away or blasting the odd pirate (who can somehow sense you have cargo whilst you fly at sublight speeds SOMEHOW) You want more excitment you can be a smuggler and the police will then stop and scan you, not randomly, no. They will stop and scan you because they KNOW you have illegal cargo. These stop and scans don't just happen as a routine. And it's really quite a glaringly obvious thing, but hey at least you can roleplay and pretend the AI isn't omnisciently ♥♥♥♥ing you in the ♥♥♥.   You can be a mercenary or privateer, pirate or guard, which I found the most fun and profitable for a time, but after killing many a silly AI ship the game was updated and made them much more like humans, much more skilled. Now fighting them often ends up as a game of chicken, whoever exits the death game of ring a round the rosies in space will get shot at and be in a bad position.

It's obviously an amazingly well put together game that does lack quite a bit of content, but what's there is absolutely solid, they'll eventually add more missions and stuff to do, like planetary landings (better ones) and the ability to *gasp* get out of your bloody ship and even walk around and multicrew a ship. Along with much exploration content including aliens and bits and pieces, alien history or some such. Getting up out of your ship and walking around planets and your own ships are literally the things the game needs most right now, and hopefully it comes fast. Then they can focus on the one other thing that needs to be added, well a few things: More ♥♥♥♥♥ landable planets.   So there's my review. I'd give it a meh out of 10 but it's quite good for what it is and will only get better, the devs are very competent and good, I'd rather they spent loads of time making solid content than bugged and mediocre content. So there's that. Well done Frontier let's hope it'll eventually become a game to last the ages.    ",

And the next season costing 60 USD (45 for players who already own the game) is pretty rediculous. 30 USD would be more reasonable for the content with this expansion.

Probably the best space sim out there - and I've tried many of them, from the X series to Wing Commander, Starpoint Gemini, Freelancer, etc.  Now, a few more words: the game makes you feel part of its universe, but contrarily of what happens in X, where you ALONE in an entire UNIVERSE can shape the destiny of entire systems, here you are what you really are: a pilot, out there, in the big empty, living, fighting, trading and exploiting your best skills and resources to gain fame and fortune, or to simply explore the vastity of the entire Milky Way - in a scale I've NEVER seen before.  The ship simulation part alone is superb: it feels like you actually are in your ship, and the mechanics of fighting and flying are really really the best ones I've seen and tried so far.  Some people complain about the lack of a story, a campaign: in my opinion (and not only mine) these people do NOT understand what a space SIMULATION game really is.  YOU ARE THE STORY.  Yes, you, your story is shaped by your actions, your decisions; by what you want to actually BE, and in Elite: Dangerous you can be pretty whatever you want. With Powerplay, you can join one of the biggest factions in the game, and help them expand, thrive and conquer: you can't make their decisions (but you can vote for some things, so there is a minimal decisional part) about where to expand or where to fight, because you are just a pilot. Just. A. Pilot. A pilot out there flying through a billion solar systems.  But there is more.  There are community events, wars, treaties, things happening in the galaxy while you fly, while you trade, while you fight. A background of events that are actually happening, all collected in an in-game newscast (I really recommend to read the news from time to time, it really makes you feel part of something enormous and alive); For example, did you know there is a legendary traveling space station, that moves from system to system, that you can actually find (or read about its movements in the news)? Or that there are alien structures and artifacts, found in one of those billions of systems by real players?  By the way, this is a space simulation game. Those who complain about being alone for some time in deep space, well, maybe they're playing the wrong game, don't you think? I mean, what the hell did you expect from a SPACE sim, if not being in SPACE, for some time?  Last but not least, the updates for the game are really promising. The devs have already released interesting features, and they are planning to add even more: exiting from the ship, walking around stations and planets, avatar creation, landing on habitable planets (for now you can only land on non-habitable planets, where there are stations similar to those in space) and more.  So, what are you waiting for? If you love space simluation, you'll love Elite: Dangerous and its vastity and freedom of choice: now get your damn Sidewinder and start flying, Commander.

Logged quite a few hours on this game now and have very little bad to say about it.  +Small things make a big impact: you can tell the creators took the time to make the little things matter and even something that becomes common like navigation or hyper jumping continue to feel meaningful even though you've done them hundreds of times before. +REALLY choose your own path: lots of games boast this but not many do it as well as Elite Dangerous. You really can choose however you WANT to play. Granted there are some career paths that are more 'profitable' than others (ie smuggling, bounty hunting, pirating etc.) BUT that is not to say you can't be a miner or a trader if you prefer a simpler space life. +Everything is an investment: some games will have you struggle to decide if you should upgrade your current gear or spring for the next level upgraded stuff. ED lets you have your cake and eat it too. Every purchase/upgrade for your ships that you buy will count towards the NEXT upgrade as well OR lower the actual funds you need to buy your next, bigger, better ship! Example: you buy an upgrade for 1M credits; the NEXT upgrade is worth 2M credits, because you already spent 1M on the original part you only need to raise an additional 1M credits to buy the newer upgrade because you get your money back when you replace the old part! Likewise all this money you invest in your ship counts towards reducing how much actual on hand cash you need to buy a new ship! If your ship has a total value of 50M credits and the new ship you're looking at costs 75M credits then you only need to raise the 25M difference! +Combat may be repetetive, but it's not dull: Even on a private or solo server there are PLENTY of random events that the NPCs will spring on you to keep things interesting. There are a few standard setups but each space battle is going to go differently, and if you find yourself outmatched you always have the option to run away and live to fight another day lol. +Sounds, music, etc: all add to the immersion and you'll find yourself forgetting you're not actually inside the cockpit of your ship. Although a good space music station on Pandora playing in the background doesn't hurt either :P.  -Probably the biggest and possibly only negative that this game has is it's learning curve. It has about half a dozen tutorials ranging from space combat to how to navigate, but even after running through all of them you'll probably still find yourself struggling at first. Myself and everyone I currently play with has had this happen to them and all i can say is: KEEP GOING! Once you break past that threshhold of awkward flying and mis-navigation and get your first or second ship upgrades you'll find it hard to stop! -The last negative i'll list is totally avoidable but it must be mentioned. IMHO currently the Open Play option is kind of pointless. The only reason someone would play in open play is to have interaction with other players obviously. But what interaction can you have? Sure you could team up in a wing and go take on bigger/badder enemies, but what are MOST people doing? Pirating.... griefing .... etc... Not only that but there are so many ways to get away from other players that even if you ARE good at PKing it's possible you could still get people slipping away from you by logging off mid combat and switching to a solo server to heal up. Really it's just a waste of time. I play on a private server with a small group of friends who have also picked up the game and it's not dull or lonely or boring or any of that. Maybe once they fix some of the flaws with open play i'll venture over there but for now i'm content.  TLDR: game is awesome. play on a private/solo server. nothing is a wasted purchase. you can do whatever you want!",

IMO this game plays alot like mulitplayer Microsoft Freelancer except the mouse flight controls are currently almost the worst I have encountered and the user interface in general could do with some TLC.  If you liked multi-player Microsoft Freelancer, then you will probably enjoy this game but be warned that it is not particularly forgiving to new players and I would advise playing through all the 'main game' tutorials to make sure you are happy with some of the least intuitive aspects of the game.",

Another day I'll decide I want to do some bounty hunting, so I'll go to a resource extraction site, and hunt all the pirates there. The scope and scale is massive. Granted, there are times where there's so much to do that you really don't know where to start, but this game is unbelievably good.

It's simple enough to enjoy, yet complex enough to keep it real. The game lacks a defining plot, but that's one of its greatest strengths in that you are the one who chooses the story, and what to do with it. Elite Dangerous is a game of return. You have to put effort and patience into it, but given the time you'll find yourself more, and more rewarded. The game is smooth, looks good, and feels even better.",

This game is for you.  The actions you make in this game actually influence the galaxy. You can cause security lockdowns, economic recessions, economic booms, or civil wars just by completing missions in systems. The universe is a living simulation held together by numbers cruncing in the background that is happening all the time. You can befriend different factions, or you can really tick them off, each has its own effects.  There are tons of ship types, trading, exploring, mining, combat, smuggling, and ones inbetween. You can customize and upgrade these ships however you want if you've got the credits.  If you like any of the following this game may not be for you: detailed quest descriptions, handholding, simple controls, little consequences for death, being rewarded immediately.   IMPORTANT You are not meant to grind. All ships are different, just because one is more expensive doesn't necessarily make it better. Learn to play one tiny goal at a time, and enjoy the game. This game work best when you have these two things: Imagination, Patience  If this sounds like a game you can sink your teeth into I encourage you to buy it, and I look forward to seeing you in game.

            "review_text": "First off, this is NOT EVE online, this is not the X-series, this is Elite.  You will not find multi-hundred-player groups fighting in massive space battles for control of an entire sector. You will not have the ability to build an entire inter-stellar empire and command legions of ships.  You will be in total control of one single starship, and this is something most people underestimate. In Elite, you ARE the pilot. No auto-pilot, no clicking to move, and no simplification of controls. You will feel the roar of the engines as you decelerate coming in to dock. You will hear the hull creak as you boost through an asteroid field making tight turns to avoid enemy fire. You will see every last control, every menu, every HUD element modeled in your ship, usable by an actual pilot.  You have control over all of your thrusters, not just a 'speed' setting. You can apply thrust in 6 different directions, and combine those 6 however you want to accomplish very precise acrobatics.  You control every single thing attached to your ship, so yes, you can turn off life support to get more power to your engines/shields/weapons, but also yes, you will freeze to death/run out of air.  This is not a story-driven experience, there is never someone talking in your ear about rescuing a princess or stopping the bad-guy, or telling you where to go next. This is you, just you, in a spaceship, in a fully modeled galaxy. Freedom. You want to be a smuggler? Find a system controlled by a dictator and buy illegal military-grade weapons, then smuggle them back into 'civilized' space and sell for a large profit. But, those guys who bought the guns? They don't go away, they actually use them. You could cause a civil war to break out on that space station, and the criminal group could take control. You can and WILL influence the galaxy.  Galaxy? Yes. 400 billion (billion!) star systems, about 150,000 of which are created using actual space-telescope data. This means that if you go to Earth, in the Sol system in this game, you will see our actual real-life sky with actual real-life stars and constellations. Every single one re-created using astronomic charts and data. It also means there is no 'Sky Box' so to speak, because every last star you see in the space around you is a real object that you can visit. They're just really far away.  Real combat. This is not a game where you select a target, initiate auto-targeting and auto-firing weapons, and then have a nap until one of you goes pop. No dice rolls here, everything is up-to-par with a modern FPS. If you're a good shot, you can aim for specific parts of the enemy vessel. Keep your shots on one of their attitude thrusters, rupture it, and see their ship spiral out of control for a few moments before the damage gets contained. Hell, shoot out their canopy and their engines, and then listen carefully as they succumb to the cold void of space, powerless and without life support. Of course, that can all happen to you too. There will be moments where you scramble to re-route power from your collapsed shields into engines, hoping to escape while your thrusters malfunction, bullets shattering your canopy and whizzing past your pilots face.  Skill based game, not 'Skill' based. You do not level up any abilities, you do not increase attributes, you do not buy really expensive books that take weeks to 'read' so that you can fly bigger ships. You actually get better as a player. You notice things like vertical thrust affecting your turn radius. You practice firing fixed cannons at moving targets. You learn exactly where the 'sweet spot' is on your ships throttle, and you know when to flip a 180-turn and slam it into reverse, leaving your enemy directly in your sights like you are some sort of Battlestar Galactica style badass.  Some people will say Elite: Dangerous is a 'grind', sure, for some people maybe it is. But when you have fun playing a game, actual fun, then doing the same thing isn't a grind, it's playing the game. We never hated on Tetris for being a scoreboard grind, we never hated Unreal Tournament for being the same shoot-die-respawn patterns over and over, because we were having fun actually playing the game. Check my play-time, I have yet to find this game even slightly boring. I stopped needing money a long time ago, I have my dream ship already, but I still go out and fight as a mercenary, I still hunt bounties, because it's fun. It isn't a game you play for fake-money rewards or stat-increases, it's a game you play for fun.  Now, if having total freedom in a galaxy that is billions of systems big, with thousands of other players who could help or hinder you at any time for any reason doesn't sound like fun, then don't buy this game. If you frequently get bored of games when they aren't telling you what your next goal is, then don't buy this game. If you think games should be 'easy to play' then don't buy this game. If you never read the manual that comes with a game, then don't buy this game.  If you want to fly a spaceship, in a realistically simulated galaxy, with other people from around the globe, then you should buy this game.",

For people who are umming and erring about buying this.  GIVE ELITE: DANGEROUS A CHANCE!  Once you get the hang of the controls buy something more compentent that your starting Sidewinder ship. There's something oddly cathartic about travelling through deep space smuggling drugs, slaves, illegal weapons, or just collecting whatever bounties you can get.  Oh, and invest in an auto docking component for your ship, not only does it take away the worry of docking, it plays Blue Danube as it docks for you, a little detail that made me chuckle (as an avid 2001 fan). Get used to the controls. Get better components for your ship, let the galaxy open up to you and you'll be sucked into the game like matter gets sucked into a black hole.",

In my opinion these two things above are perfectly executed and will keep me playing this game for a while alone.  However there are things that give me mixed feelings :    - Graphic is nice (using EDfx) with some cool looking ships models,stars,effects and everything else  but  it does lack some variety for example there are only few space stations types and they are all designed the same way.Close Quarters Combat Championship (CQC) shows Frontier is capable of doing something more complex so why in main game it is simply boring ? Also one station type (i think it is actually two station types but they both look similar) is just terrible (looking on you box'y thing'y) and can drive new players completely mad if they don't realize there are arrows pointing them to the enterence, i wish it's redesigned.   - Ships are well designed, they look cool,feels different and don't sound the same  but  i don't like how they cost is balanced.It's not difficult to start earning a bit more credits and some cheaper ships are there to just test them out for few minutes.  - Activities like bounty hunting,mining,trading,exploration benefits from good flying model and visuals.Because of that they don't bore me (and you don't have to focus on just one thing and grind it) ]b]but[/b] they are rather simple and doesn't offer much variety no matter what ship you own.  - Horizons add possibility to land on planets with no atmosphere   and it's surprisingly well done  , i saw some reviews saying it's all the same and there is nothing interesting to see but that's a fat  lie .As i done some exploration here (at my side) and there (by there i mean youtube and screenshots) there are planets with interesting colors,textures,visual effects and terrain.Just as an example i saw two planets very close to each other, both super beat up and they were looking like a space potatoes - completely cool and unexpected (i have more but don't wont to spoil things up).  However  while planets can look cool in space and on the ground they don't offer almost nothing more when you land on them (screenshot maker how i would call it).On the main forums i found confirmation - there is nothing special out there.It's cool to drive around SRV taking pretty pics but that's it.  - Missions are so bad let's just skip them with some silence.  - Terrible balance and sort of 'exploits' with credits earning process ♥♥♥♥ me off i am getting red when i think of it.There are ways to earn a lot of credits very fast and it's overall legit, but they were oversight from developers and were patched too some degree, but too late.A nail to the coffin is a fact that if you want to focus on earning credits then be prepared for log in-log out simulator.Why i care about other players credits ? It is an mmo afterall !  My list can go on, and i am not planning to include TL;DR version but let me stop here for now.  Despite it flaws i love this game and more or less i will play it this whole year.There are some other games coming out in near future with bigger names attached to them and this season is probably be or not to be for Elite:Dangerous.List of this year upcoming updates looks very promising so i keep my hopes high.

Elite: Dangerous - Should you buy it??? Short answer yes... But only if your interested in the genre.  I admit I was a little cautious when considering spending the £39 for the game so I did some digging around and thought to myself screw it why not. To my supprise I was pleasently shocked with the game and what it offers.  If your willing to put the time in and get around the somewhat learning curve the game has, it is a very rewarding experience. The 17hrs time I have put into the game has been over 2 days. That should give you a indication to how drawn in and how much i am enjoying the game so far. You feel like your flying around in a spaceship exploring the stars and you get the feeling of how *SMALL* you are in it. There are billions of place's to discover, weather you wonnna be a trader , miner . pirate ( pvp and pve ) , bounty hunter or explorer you will have a great experience doing so.  If I were to rate this game then it gets a solid 9 out of 10. Only reason it is not a 10 is the fact there could be more ships / upgrades and building your own space stations or something ( but that might be asking a bit much since its already a big game ).

            "review_text": "This game.... Oh man this game. I've been playing since December 2014, only just got my Steam key today. In an attempt to avoid a long winded review that will be wordier than necessary, I will try to rate individual aspects of the game on a scale of 1-10, and I may leave a little comment afterwards if I feel like it deserves some extra notability. Everything in this game deserves attention.  I'll start with the graphics, of course.  Graphics: 10/10. Few games manage to capture as much beauty in their entire display as this game can capture in one simple screenshot. As you explore the galaxy, both civilized and uncivilized, explored and unexplored... you will never cease to be dumbstruck by its pure beauty. And because everything is realistically rendered at a 1:1 scale, stars will dwarf you, nebulas will engulf you, black holes will terrify you, and all along, your mind will struggle to grasp the fact that these things that seem to mock your insignificance are in and of themselves, insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  I can already tell I'm talking too much.  Story: 9/10. The game's integrated story is interesting enough, with three major factions warring over control of human space and a new emergence of mystery and conspiracy with the reappearance of the single deadliest thing humans have ever encountered; the Thargoids. But what makes Elite so unique is its ability to let the player create his or her own story. Nothing is enforced upon the player. You can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone. And whether you choose to take part in the galactic storyline or not is entirely up to you.  Gameplay: 9/10. Related to what I said above. You can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone. If you want to be a trader, you can trade. If you want to be a pirate, by all means, be a pirate. But expect the Federation's bounty hunters to be on your ♥♥♥. If you want to see the center of the galaxy, as well as its dimmest edges, go for it. There are so many ways to make money and experience in this game that it fits everyone's playstyle. The controls are extremely tight, and dogfights are intense. Unfortunately, it has the potential to be bland at times when you're supercrusing to a station that is 350,000ls away.   Sound: 10/10. Elite's sound design is rarely mentioned but always recognized and appreciated. The very first time you throttle up in your Freewinder, you will  feel  the power of the engine. Just wait until you buy your first Viper, the muscle car of space. Every ship feels and sounds unique, every laser and gun has force behind it. For a 'space sim' it feels surprisingly like playing Doom 3 and blasting aliens away with the shotgun. The background music that you hear when you're in Supercruise reminds me of Skyrim's freeroam soundtrack. Its calming and adventurous, and makes you feel like you're charting unkown territory. When you reach the end of your plotted route, a short inspirational and exciting tune plays to congratulate you. When you're fighting enemies in a Combat Zone and they just barely miss you when flying at you head one, you feel like you need to duck to avoid your hair being singed off. The sound is easily one of the most immersive aspects of the game.  Immersion: 10/10. Easily one of the most immersive games I've ever played. Its up there with Minecraft. You can play for 6 hours, easily. And not notice the time go by. Its kind of scary actually. I'd estimate at this point I have probably 300 hours in the game, possibly more, and I've been playing for about 6 months. Its seriously immersive. If you're looking for a game to dump a Summer into or to just escape into, this is it.  Innovation: 9/10. This is a made of category, I know, but its necessary for this game. The only other 'game' in existence that I'm aware of that has even attempted to create the universe at the scale that is present in Elite is 'Space Engine' and what it has in technological impressiveness, it lacks in like everything else. Its an engine, not a game. Elite: Dangerous has created a 1:1 scale recreation of the Milky Way galaxy, and everything is there. If its been recorded by astronomers, its in the game, and you can find it. By the way, in case you were wondering, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy? Sagittarius A*. You're welcome. There are many additions to be added to the game that Frontier haven't implemented yet, so as of now I've set the score to '9/10,' but as things like seemless planetary landing on 1:1 scale planets and first-person combat are added, the score will be adjusted accordingly.  Overall: 10/10. I could not be more satisfied with this game. It is a masterpiece of modern gaming and I don't say that lightly. It is truly the most liberating, humbling, draw dropping, invigorating experience I have ever had in PC gaming.",

            "review_text": "If you're looking for an immersive space flight simulator and having the ability to do almost anything you want, how you want it, with a living constant gameplay 'universe' (well 400 billion star systems that make up the vast Milky Way) either by yourself or with other players, then this is the game for you. Hence the word 'simulator', you're not going to find arcade shoot em' up here. Although the mechanics are designed that you can go all out and take out bad guys or good guys (matter of persepctive), all in all it's a simulator with semi realistic controls. Everything from landing your ship into the docking stations, taking off, employing and retracting your weapon arsenals, plotting hyperdrive and spacecruise paths, crash and burn into suns.......it's out there in the vastness of space.  There's a small tutorial which focuses a lot on the combat side of things in which I think most players casual and fanbois alike would enjoy. I also recommend using the preflight checks in which your 'Maiden Voyage' by default seems to engage itself. Although you can play with a mouse and keyboard, I recommend at minimum either a good gamepad or joystick for better immersion.  The learning curve is not as high as the X Series and it only took me about an hour to figure out how to fly around. You start off with a Sidewinder which is a small craft and you have to literally figure it out on your own. Your best bet is to hit the Bulletin Boards for small missions such as carry this from point A to point B to get some fast but small rewards. I started my first few hours taking up courrier and small haul jobs until I got enough money for a Viper.  The space craft in the game allows you to customize the ships based on your gameplay. If you want to be a miner and take out your frustrations blasing asteroids you can do it. As I understand it's a good way to start off amounting good cash in the beginning. You'll have to rig your ship with some decent cargo space, mining lasers, and a refinery to churn those blasted rocks into minerals and metals. Then fly to a station with a commodities market and sell. Or if you want to dive into dogfighting you'll need to invest into your ship and upgrade with weapons, shields, fast flight drives, thrusters, etc etc. If you want to bounty hunt I recommend getting the kill warrant module. Right now I am pretending I am my own Boba Fett lol! You can also stake a claim into the treading scene and try to play around the supply and demand in commodities.  AFter a long while it can get a bit monotinous, however there are 400 billion star systems int he game which is all but the Milky Way. The expanisive galaxy map does a pretty good job in making you feel like a 'dust in the wind'. WHich all the more pushes you to seek out better upgrades, larger scores of bad guys, and maybe even spark a civil war in a region of space.  Have yet to dive in to the 'Open World' mode but at anytime while logging in you have to select either Open World or Solo play. Either way you still play as your pilot in a constant server (this game requires an internet connection whether you want to solo or not). New players I recommend going solo at first to get a hang of it, then go open world. Open world brings a little more interaction in the game where you as a player can do all the same things I had mentioned to other players. You can fight them, join them, in anything like pirating, bounty hunting, trading, form convoys, etc. Think of it in some ways as Eve Online but you're in the cockpit and minus all the space station building. After all this is a space flight simulator.  So if you're looking for something more than just a dogfighting game with button mash em up, get this game. You won't regret it.",

Luckily there is faster-than-light speed drives &gt;.&lt;  I have mastered the knack of landing and launching into/from stations, and today O made my first trade profit; only a few hundred credits but it's a good feeling :)  Combat I find vary hard as I am on a basic ship with no auto-aim and so it's nigh on impossible (for me anyway) to fight, but I guess that's how it would be in 'real life'.

I was wearing headphones playing this game and when I came out o super-drive (a sort of sub-jump drive you initially fall into when emerging from hyper-jump drive), and jumped out of my skin at the BANG when you fall out of light speed &gt;.&lt;  I approached one station that only had three docks and there were about half a dozen online players waiting to dock so there was a bit of a queue for about 15 minutes, but I passed the time by chatting to the other waiting pilots.  I played the original Elite back in 1984 on my Amstrad CPC 464 with it 'massive' 64KB (yes, that's KB) or RAM memory. &gt;.&lt;  I play with a joystick, which I recommend doing, but it’s worth taking the few minutes to set up the keys/controls exactly how you want them.  The game plays vary smoothly on my labtop, though sometimes there is a little lag in hyperspace as you move, or so I believe, between servers, but it doesn’t detract from the gameplay. So this is a game I recommend if you like all aspects of space games from frantic combat to trading to serene flying between systems at your own leisure.  I played X Rebirth but do prefer this one.

(btw david braben said he has 10 year plan for this game; and i really hope he achieves that). now for more objective part of review: +awesome graphics. +great sound and sound effects. +insanely massive game world: 400,000,000,000 star systems availible to visit. +so much more to do compared to vanilla. +fair marketing model: buy base game (really cheap nowadays), and each 1-1.5 years buy season pass for a lot more content (optional). +best community you will find for a game, period. +very active forum, with millions of posts. +very communicative developers, doing livestreams and giveaways very often, also very active on forums. +you can play for thousands of hours, there is always something more to do. +30+ playable ships atm i think. +/-for now, you can only land on barren planets, but more planet types will be unlocked for landing in future. -game is at it's core still a bit grindy, but not as much as vanilla version. -some aspects of game are still not very well developed, for example power play, but it's not game breaking, it just feels like it could be taken out of game and nobody would give a ♥♥♥♥. but they're working on it, to make it better.  there are still loads of things in this game to write about, but i can't be bothered. i think i covered most important things.  9/10",

When you make enough money to buy a good ship (and upgrade it) you can do whatever you want. Also, make sure that you use elitetradingtool if you want to become trader and never be shy to go to reddit and ask for help anywhere else.",

            "review_text": "Elite Dangerous is a pretty badass game. I bought it as part of the Black Friday sale after having it sit on my wishlist for several months. Now that I have some time invested I feel I can give it a review. Before I touch on key points I feel I should say not to compare this to Eve. There is no right clicking and selecting 'fly within X kilometers' or any other dumb ♥♥♥♥ like that. You are TRULY the pilot. The only real commonality would be time spent in flight to a station but even then, you personally land.  Story There is none. It's a big sandbox with more solar systems than you'll ever get to explore. There are galactic powers that you can pledge allegiance to but that's as close to story as there is. Otherwise you're roleplaying with yourself or any friends you may have playing with you. There is an interesting dynamic of a power struggle between the galactic powers that is player driven but that once again boils down to your own roleplaying.  Graphics ED is a very beautiful game that doesn't seem very hard on hardware. On a GTX980 I'm able to play on ultra settings on my 1080 monitor and achieve over 200fps so I'm sure higher resolutions can be playable on lower cards. Ultra settings at this resolution tends to hang around 2.3GB of VRAM usage.  Sound Pretty good. You can argue too good since you can hear your lasers hitting a ship for 2km away in an area devoid oof oxygen but otherwise it's pretty amazing. The sound of the ship, weapons systems, systems warnings and notifications... All are clear, crisp, and nice.  Controls The control setup for a gamepad is actually pretty terrifying. All buttons tend to function more as modifiers. An example would be to hold X while pressing any of the 4 directions on the D-pad to perform 1 of 4 actions. Multiply that by the number of buttons on the controller and it gets pretty complicated really quickly. You can map buttons as you'd expect in the world of PC gaming...  Mouse and keyboard is another story. At first it will feel very clunky and even worse while trying to land but after a few hours in gets a lot easier and becomes a breeze. I can't comment on flight stick use as mine is supposed to be delivered tomorrow but a clanmate tells me support is phenomonal and he wouldn't want it any other way.  Technical difficulties... I originally had some pretty serious issues with random crashing. If you purchase this game and have it crash to black screen, lock your computer up, and force you to hard reboot, don't despair. Forums are mostly useless but after several hours of digging I found the fix for me. In EVGA PrecisionX there's an option called 'Kboost'. It keeps the GPU running at full boost speed instead of the adaptive frequency to save power. I'm guessing the crash is from whatever micro lag occured from frequency shifts in the card. There are quite a few people with this problem and if it happens to you I suggest trying this fix. Of course this is for Nvidia users and I can't speak for AMD.  This review was typed prior to release of the Horizons expansion so I can't give any info on that.",

Played beta it was alright, the lack of mission avalability was aweful but the game's rich atmosphere still pulled through. I love how the game just pulls you in once you get the hang of the mechanics. Much like Eve you can do what ever you want, when ever you want how ever you want but although a sandbox space simulation MMO it has mny difference from Eve. As Eve Online is still a great game althoguh the player base has diminished due to ccp's past dumb game discision's, This game is all manual. Nothing is automatic and you have have to really focus on profit and risk. So far I've manage to smuggle and Pirate my way into a cobra Mk III and still going strong.   This is my first Review ever on steam so I'll try to be specific on what I like and don't like.   My likes first, is pretty everything. Just the Immersion of the game is by far the best I've seen and Experienced. The music, the design and just the over all performance of the game right now I beleive to be just almost the top of the list of a great simulation sandbox MMO. With the first Expac for the game game coming out in just a short time that also adds more features to the game, more missions, more money to make (Yay! &gt;:D) as well as the most anticipated being able to land and walk on the surfaces of habited planets. (Mind you it has not been said that this feature will be added at the beggining of Horizons) However it will be added in a good time during the Expac. The Devs really know what the playerbase are looking for and have a very good ear for the Fans. they listen and they take everything into consideration which I believe makes a good company in the gaming industry today. Dev's and producers that listen to the players. I see many years of this game shining. Will it be a top competiter with other MMO's already out or future MMO I do not know. but I do know this game is right now to me top of the bar.  I can't say there is really anything I do not like about this game. It does have its bugs here and their but really not intrusive as they only happen once in awhile rarely. but thats my experience so far. Keep up the Good work FD!  So YUes I recommend people to atleast try the game. if you want to wait untill its on sale or until Horizons comes out, Try it atleast. It is not for everyone, it deffinately has a somewhat steppe learning curve and it can take awhile to adjust to it but once you do there is much reward to be had.",

            "review_text": "First of all: If you are looking for a fast-paced, space shooter with an arcade feel, then Elite Dangerous is not a game for you.   This is a space sim with a heavy emphasis on 'realism'. That means there are a lot of things that may seem like a time waste, pointless struggle or even bad design, but all of those things were implemented in order to provide the best simulation of spacefaring. There is A LOT to learn, flying ships is not an easy feat by itself, and a simple docking procedure is more complicated than you would have thought. There is a lot of time where 'nothing' happens as you travel through the systems, check the galactic map for the systems to trade in, visit stations to accept missions and check the prices of the commodieties etc.  Elite dangerous is a giant sandbox, where you set your own goals and you do whatever you want. Trade, explore, mine, hunt criminals or be the criminal yourself: all of these are fun in their own way and you can make a living doing each one of them. The progression curve is very steep (after 50 hours I got a decent ship, but it feels like I'm still scratching the surface), so most of the time you will be doing the same thing for a long while, but there is always varriety to be found in every activity. I have not felt bored doing anything just yet, I have always found ways to keep myself invested.  The only thing I have a big problem with is the lack of tutorial or introduction to the game world (all you get is a couple of ship excercises and that's it). I had no idea what can and cannot do, nor where should I start apart from the common sense that didn't really help much. Thankfuly there is a lot of material on the internet, and you can generaly find out everything you want without a problem. So keep that in mind, if you decide to play Elite Dangerous you will have to do a lot of research. Apart from that, it's the best space sim currently on the market. If you aren't afraid of being thrown into the deep sea, then you'll like this one.  TL/DR: If you are looking a Freelancer-like experience, this is as close as you will get.",

That said they are 100% going to add more ships, better missions, different kind of planet surfaces, walking, FPS action and a ♥♥♥♥ load more of stuff.   Everybody needs to learn to calm down and have some patience towards this game. I have been patient and waited I believe 3 years for this game to develop and it has developed majorly. And 2016 is a very very very bright year for Elite, they are going to be doing so much for the game. And don't mind my hours. I have spend around 21 times the amount of my current hours in the game as of 2/06/2016.   So everybody just be patient and sit back and just be happy you can sit and play new game features from day 1.  Keep up the good work Frontier and I certainly look forward to how Elite turns this year.",

This is a seated experience however the cockpit has 360 degrees of great detail along with interactive panels in the cockpit. The graphics show amazing scale and endless breathtaking scenes while the simulator side of the game is detailed and immersive. The open world itself has incredible scale with factions, economies, community goals etc, and numerous gameplay styles.   Since the game has released the developers have added a ton of content, i can't believe where this game started compared to where it's at now. They've also added tuturioals which greatly help the steep learning curve this game once had.   You really need a HOTAS setup to play this - a controller just isn't enough. Overall a great VR experience, once in awhile i get a tiny bit of judder on my 980 Ti on planet surfaces but that's about it. The menus work in VR with a joystick, the only con is, is that you have press ESC on the keyboard to exit. I feel this is an overlooked title on VIVE that's really worth your time if you're into flight, space travel, etc Get it dont look back.",

Learn the game so I can really enjoy it when I finally get the Oculus Rift 2. Take a trip to Sagitarrius A eventually (after watching some inspiring youtube vlogs about it)  So far I recently discovered bounty hunting for credits. It's lucrative, fun, and teaches you the basics of combat. That being said, I wish the other professions were equally worth my time. I would love to get into more trading and exploration, but in the beginning stages it's not really worth it.  I do love the escapism this game provides. It has been very satisfying to fly into the ring of a gas giant, to gravity slingshot around a planet, and to land on a random planet I picked out. I realize this will eventually get boring, but I haven't even begun to explore the mission aspect of planetary bases.  In my opinion, the game was worth the money already. It has provided some very enjoyable playtime, and the combat is fun and engaging. I am very much looking forward to being able to walk around spaceships and multicrew with my RL friends. I have a strong desire to be able to walk around inside my ship knowing the Sag A black hole is just outside my hull; especially in VR.  I am an avid EVE Online player so I'm used to the concept of a space sim sandbox - specifically that you bring your own imagination and goals into a game like this. It will not hold your hand, and it will not throw content at you. You have to be willing to have a dream, and go chase after that dream. This game definitely provides plenty of opportunity to dream, and to realize those dreams.",

            "review_text": "Elite Dangerous is an interesting experience that many people will appreciate and many more will not. Although it uses modern graphics and physics, it does not hold your hand or explain things to a new pilot the way most games have been doing for the last 10 years. Rather it follows a philosophy of older games, where a player must find out and discover mechanics on their own. At least the internet has been popularized since the release of the original Elite, so a player can likewise turn to other sources of information, and thus learn what other players have already discovered through forums and wikis.  If you read the reviews on Steam, many complain that there is no real story in the game. While in reality there is a story, it comes at a snail’s pace, in real time, week by week, and generally involves systems and place I have never been to as a relative unknown pilot just trying to make his way in the universe, much as the big stories of real life more often involve heads-of-state and celebrity rather than fast food workers, parcel couriers, or even the average soldier. Real life is often boring and a regular grind, which this game can excel in mimicking.  On the other hand, this game can at the same time offer white-knuckle excitement on occasion to those who happen to be in the right place at the right time to find it.  I had been flying rare goods runs with my new Cobra Mk. III and finally had enough money to get some A-grade components, including a brand new A-grade shield emitter. Although I have been concentrating on trade runs, I have some combat experience against pirates and wanted to push my combat rating up from the “Novice” grade it currently sits at, so I proceeded to a Resource Extraction Zone to await the inevitable pirates that show up to prey on the miners that work there. I love being a working class hero...  It wasn’t long before another Cobra Mk. III shows up. Initial scan shows the pilot as wanted in the system I was currently in, and the Kill Warrant Scanner shows her as wanted in an additional system, so I figured it’s time to go to work. Her pilot rating shows as “Dangerous” so, while much higher than my own rating, I assume system security would be by shortly to assist and that my dynamic human thinking will give me an edge over her automated NPC skills. You know what they say about the word assume?  So, without further ado, I open up with lasers. I’m behind her, and while she’s trying to turn to face me, I initially do quite well at staying out of her weapon sights. System security still hasn’t shown up but I seem to have the upper hand so far. I manage to take her shields down just as she manages to get me in her gun sights, and that’s when I heard the ship’s computer say the most dreadful thing about an impulse attack. I don’t have the Horizons expansion so I have no access to the mysterious “Engineers” but it seems this enemy Cobra has enhanced weapons. I knew the NPCs had been bugged in the game where they were getting overly advanced weaponry, and that the bug had been fixed. Later reading informed me that some high-ranked pilots still had enhanced weaponry, such as those in the “Dangerous” combat rank. Great.  The first salvo takes down my shields, so I immediately decide that survival is more important than credits so I boost down into the asteroid field, hoping to hide in the rocks and avoid the missile. No such luck as it hit just before I can engage silent running, and suddenly in addition to massive hull damage, I have a completely destroyed thruster system.  So there I am, my ship tumbling over and over as I see asteroids pass by within centimetres of the hull. I engage silent running and shut down my systems. This takes me off her radar, but leaves me without any defences. I am fully expecting death at any moment but at least preferring to be killed in an asteroid collision rather than letting this dirty pirate get the best of me.  Still tumbling through the asteroids, I engage the reboot and repair functions on my ship's computer, hopefully to get thrusters back online to be able to save myself. The computer goes entirely offline, along with all of my systems including life-support. I am sitting in the silence watching the asteroids pass by me at hundreds of kilometers per hour. Against all odds, my ship still somehow in one piece, the computer announces that the thrusters have been repaired. I turn them on, stabilize my flight-path, and aim for the edge of the asteroid field.  My pursuer quickly locates me as soon as my thrusters ignite, and once again I am hit by an impulse weapon attack, taking my thrusters offline and tumbling my ship. Just as the missile launch warning comes up this time, however, I am quick to drop to silent running. I had given up my heat sink launcher for a chaff launcher, a decision I am reconsidering now, so my stealth is far from perfect, but it is enough to have the missile miss me.   Once again tumbling through the asteroids, I reboot my systems, hoping to bring my thrusters back. A peek up through the canopy tells me that my ship is beginning to clear the asteroid field, and just as my thrusters come back online, I vector away from the asteroid field and boost for all that I am worth.  With my heat maxing out, smoke and sparks flying from my consoles, my frame shift drive begins to spin up and I have to open my heat radiators before I explode, making me visible to radar again. My pursuer launches missiles, but this time it is she that is too late. With the missile mere metres from my hull, I jump to FTL. I survived with hull at 6%, thrusters at 1%, and humility around 95%.  It was one of the most engaging, spontaneous, and fun moments I’ve had in many years of gaming.  Think I’m going to check out the target's weapons capability before engaging from now on, and maybe not pick fights with high tier pilots even if they are “lowly” NPCs. I’ve definitely learned not to depend on system security to find anything beyond right under their noses. The cops never did show up when I needed them. Seems some things never change...  This game is not for everybody, it has a difficult learning curve between basic comprehension and mastery, and it can be grindy and almost boring sometimes. But at its peak, Elite: Dangerous can be pure awesome!",

            "review_text": "Elite Dangerous is a tricky game to recommend. Very much an on/off relationship. I started in the closed beta and it was very challenging starting on your own. It was pretty harsh building up, getting a new ship then a simple mistake crashes it into a station leaving you without the cash to rebuy. That made me take a break for a few months. But I kept going back. The desire to pilot a spaceship is an itch that never goes away, ED is the only game that has been able to scratch that itch just right.  A little background, I own tons of space games. I tried Everspace (great game, just doesn't scratch my itch), and I even have Star Citizen. I haven't played many of the old school space games like the original Elite or Freelancer. I've tried EvE but the learning curve and a feeling of 'being the ship' has repelled me.   The Pros for Elite Dangerous: -Beautiful game, graphics are respectable -Sound is a huge selling point and one thing I think ED does better than 80% of the space games out -Trading is solid (not player trading) you can really feel like a space trucker if that's your thing -Micromanagement of your ship is handy but not required right off the bat -Co-op flying with a buddy is fun and easy -More than 20 ships to fly (big selling point to me)  The Cons: -Grindy -Quests aren't compelling (lots of different quests, but lacks a compelling reason to do them) -Grindy -Pretty Steep learning curve -Lack of endgame (though they are slowly fixing this) once you have the biggest ship there isn't much reason to play -Story has little weight, I like story in my games and ED doesn't have a story that feels like it effects my play  Overall I recommend it. If you are new please shoot me a line and I'll try and help you bridge that learning curve. The game is slowly building itself up. If you're looking for a game to play while you wait for SC, you're not the only one. It's a solid game, grindy, but solid. Very immersive.",

You can make the game as exciting or relaxing as you want by what you choose to do.  As of posting this review I've played 20 hours, and I've enjoyed it thoroughly. I still feel like I'm only scratching the surface of what this game has to offer.",

Far better in terms of space simulation and gameplay!  Don´t be fooled by my playtime on steam, I played this game since december last year and have poured well over 100 hours into it!  This is by far THE best space sim out there! The developers are constantly updating and adding new features and content for free and the whole game runs absolutely awesome and looks fantastic!  I played the original Elite way back, as well as the second one, but this iteration of Elite is by far the best.   If you like fantastic atmosphere, great audio work, space and dog fighting in space or trading then this is the game for you. The flight model is fantastic as well, you can switch between a guided mode or true newtonian flight dynamics. The whole galaxy is there, well over 400 billion star systems and every time I look at that galaxy map, I can somehow grasp the expanse that is space.  I love this game so much, I even bought a new computer for it, that should tell you something!  Go ahead and buy this game to support further updates and development. Buy it on Steam or even better, buy it through Frontiers own store, to support them even more!",

I will say this game is far less interactive than It hought it would be, which is obviously a huge con for many just reading through reviews. I'm okay with it though. I see a lot of great features on the horizon and have been able to entertain myself. Game looks great in VR as well. I've played it about 50/50 VR / 2d. Just love this game!",

I missed the last incarnations as I didnt have a computer to run it, but if you loved Elite, this is fantastic.   Good points:-  Once you master the controls, there is so much you can do. Great graphics. Multiplayer with friends is excellent, Huge game.  Bad points:- Servers so far for me have been quite unreliable so kicked out of the game and as its online dependant this is a real problem so far. No planet landing so far available (July 2015)  Personal thoughts:- Would like to see an offline mode so i'm not kicked out of the game.(if possible) Looking forward to improvements.

I love the fact that you can do whatever you want.   If you want to explore you can do just that. I started out doing small transport missions, then I bought a new ship and did some bounty hunting (the combat is pretty awesome once you get the hang of it).   Recently I decided to go the illegal way and be a smuggler. This is quite enjoyable and exciting. If a trip goes well, the reward is awesome.  Once I saved up a decent amount of money I will start exploring the other possibilities of this game (like the faction system for instance).  I also own Horizons and I'm really impressed by some of the planets you can land on, the views can be amazing and relaxing for some reason.  I would definitely recommend this game to space fans.

The faster than light mechanics are the best I've seen in any game and I've played pretty near all of them. You can get where you want to go without a lot of delay, but still feel like you've taken a journey.

            "review_text": "I have not been addicted to a game this much since Skyrim with some heavy modding. In fact this game has the potential to be SKyrim in space but it is lacking in a few area's. The game could do with a Main story that you can do or not do and just fly off and do what you feel like. I also Wish helping a station with missions yielded more results. The tutorials are bad it does teach you hot to fly the ship but i think honestly i could have figured that out on my own. There are other things the tutorials should have focused on as well. I was a bit lost on some things but thankfully to Youtube had it explained.  Ok now for the negitive stuff out of the way ill cover the things i like about this game since i did give it a thumbs up.   The game looks amazing every thing is very detailed it runs pretty smooth i do get a little freeze up for a second or two i dont know if it has to do with my 280X or not but otherwise runs pretty good. The ships control fantasicly and there are a lot of upgrades you can put on your ship. There is some thing so joyful when you toss out your starter ship which gets blown up pretty easy and you buy a new ship and start upgrading the hell out of it to the point those ships that came up as deadly you can now slap them around. The universe is HUGE! and i do mean HUGE! so many places to go and explore its unreal. Landing on planets and maybe chasing down a bounty would be great and i heard thats coming in DLC. So very much looking foward to that.   There are a endless supply of missions to do to make money , not to mention mining, selling solar system data , policing the gallaxy for other ships who are wanted, Be a Pirate, and doing trarde runs. Landing on a space station just feels so releastic and gives you that Sim feel which over all this game does a good job at it. The ship to ship battles are great the moments of terror as i maybe got in over my head and my ships systems get knowcked offline as i sit there helpless getting beatin down my 2 or 3 ships only to all of a sudden have my ships systems reboot and come back online with a sigh of reliefe then hoping i can get out in time by putting all systems in to the engines and hauling butt out of there and that feeling of tension as my ships jump drive charges up and starts counting down to getting the hell out o there. wondering will i make it and then it bolts out of there like a bat out of hell to just barely survive is such great fun.  Then the joy of hitting a bounty and having a score for like 100k and going Jack pot! Or the tension of jumping through the gallaxy and looking down at my fuel and seeing OH NO im not sure if i have enough fuel to make it to a refueling station. Then checking through the galaxy map trying to find one. To only just make it on fumes .  This game does a lot right although it could use a bit more to make it that great space game. Time will tell if the Devs can deliver on some of the things they have promised. Thuogh whats hear is good and a lot of fun. I also just can't stop playing it so feeling like $60 well spent for me.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: There are MAJOR issues when trying to play with friends. LAN play has been impossible, with both my friend and I sitting in the same building. It is very frustrating to try and meet up even when you are in different places on different routers. The server system is completely opaque, and there is no easy way to join the same server with certainty.   I'd give this game a big MAYBE currently. At least until they fix the multiplayer. The single-player game is fun, but all the Role-Playing comes from you and text at the moment.   If you want to play with a friend, STEER CLEAR until they fix their multiplayer bugs.  I just got into Elite: Dangerous this week when Powerplay went live.  I'm only 40 or so hours in and I'm on my third ship.   I got a Thrustmaster HOTAS flight stick for this game, and possible Oculus flight games later (no Oculus yet).  As someone who grew up playing X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter: Balance of Power, I absolutely recommend this game. With a friend on another PC it can really shine.   The Wings and Powerplay update add more interesting Endgame to an already MASSIVE game.   The 'Massive in scope but not content' complaints are warrented at this point. The devs seem to be religious about updating to fix bugs though, which is definitely a plus.  Pros: SPACE! Systems management Flight Stick Friendly Rift Friendly Absolutely immersive Docking feels awesome everytime (insert sex joke) Combat is very reminiscent of X-Wing vs Tie Fighter Smuggling feels like smuggling, you are constantly worried about being scanned  Cons: large expansions are not here yet but will add TONS of content no planet landings YET no walking around your ship YET no landing on capitol ships YET no space dinosaurs? YET! no walking around space stations YET Serious multiplayer connection issues, especially for LAN players  Suggestion: It would be nice if the Powers could have a system where they install a large FrameShift gate, for smaller ships to travel between Powers areas. I just BARELY jumped to the Power I want to support. I could easily see a new person with the Sidewinder getting lost in the space between powers.  Great Game!

Yet Elite: Dangerous is an amazing game that, though frustrating, is worth the effort.  No handholding, no beginner quests, just a start in a small (4 spaces in the cargo hold) spacecraft with most of the equipment on loan on a small neutral space station. Once you finish pre-flight checks (only mandatory on the first new flight) its just you, the vastness of space and (optionally) every other freewheeling newbie/scarred veteran out there. Mine, trade, fight, explore and inevitably end up spending hours on the tutorial vids, how to plays and so forth.  If you can get a grip on this daunting prospect then the universe is yours. Those of you who have played the Uncharted Waters I&amp;II games might find the trading from (star)port to port reminiscent. The only bits that one might consider downsides are as follows:  *Middling: -Nothing akin to an easy start, with quests and such for beginners.  -No commodities market on the beginning station. If you want to trade, then you have to start elsewhere. -Skins are available, yet their price is high in pounds, payable through the Steam wallet. IOW, pricey throughout earth.  *Minor:  -No clear indication when you should refuel. If you ebb out of frameshift in an empty solar system you're screwed basically. -If you try to adjust keybindings for an x-box360 controller then good luck as things tend to not work out. -Steep learning curve. -Certain new features will be available through DLC when they release. Pricey DLC. -Puny cargo hold on the Sidewinder.  On the other hand the positives are: -Enormous galaxy to play in -Ultimate freedom -Living, changing political climate -Humorous lore, descriptions and so forth -Challenging  In short, get this game. Forget yon standard MMORPG's and let Elite: Dangerous wow you.",

Look at the play times on a majority of negative reviews. Would you play a game you don't like for over a hundred hours? The problem with the game is that if you're expecting some incredible endgame, you'll be disappointed. It's fun as you progress and has a cool community with some very interesting goals sometimes. Recently, there was a community goal that required fuel to be donated to a station for it to make a jump to Bengal Point, another system. A group known as the Fuel Rats who help stranded players made major contribution to this event and now the massive station is moving to its new home. Control between the groups in systems fight for dominance and the players can guide this. In the past players have banded together to break dictatorship control within a system.  The gameplay is fun and the devs at Frontier Development constantly manipulate the galaxy and the powers within them. The thing that amazed me by this game more than anything when I started playing was how vast the galaxy is. I lost interest in exploration after a few days, you see a lot of amazing sights, but it's monotonous and it's lonely. Still, when you speed over the rings of a planet in supercruise and see the individual asteroids for the first time you're left awestruck. Even if the game doesn't sound right for you, I recommend getting the game just to feel how small you really are in the galaxy, not to mention the universe.  This is a game that I have spent a lot of time playing and I would recommend it to anyone who asked me about it, even when I've gotten sick of it. I've come back numerous times to enjoy Elite again. Try it and decide for yourself, but you'll probably want to reconfigure your controls. The defaults kind of suck.

The trade system and black market boost the game, but it takes a while for one to raise enough money to purchase new ship modules. As far as exploration goes, the way everyone imagines it (in a huge ♥♥♥ ship landing on a planet and driving around), it's not readily an option. With the Horizon's pack, you can land on planets. without, you can't but still ahve access to all the ships in the game. The mega ship idea is not immediately available, because big ships cost big money and you have to raise that money (sometimes with large ships upwards of 100 mil) and you can...just slowly. The more money you have, the more you earn. It's exponential but its a small slope. The expansion should be worth it in the future if they don't ♥♥♥♥ it up, but landing on planets is not quite worth $60 right now. It is great, driving around exploring the planet's surface, but maybe not worth $60...

            "review_text": "Elite: Dangerous could be described very well, the same way my favourite reviewer Yahtzee does it: it's space-truckin'! That is, if truckers were also vigilantees, bounty-hunters, pirates or pretty much whatever you want to be! There is no overall objective, no 'right way' to do anything and no 'right place' to be - especially if you consider the immense universe the game consists of. If you go to your galaxy-map in-game, which is 3D by the way, you'll notice ALOT of little flashy sparkles and even more, once you start zooming out and then it hits you: all those dots are visitable systems! 99.9% of all light sources in the game (i.e. all the stars around you and in the distance/background) can be seen up front/visited!  Influence in all systems, be it political, economical or simply brute force is forever fluctuating meaning; that awesome trade-route you've discovered might not be as effective the 100th time you run it, because the spacestations supply and demand are regulating. It's all influenced by players' actions like completing missions or engaging and/or destroying some factions' shios.  And old classic comes to mind when looking at Elite: Dangerous - And that old classic is Freelancer. All right, all right: Freelancer were way more focused on either combat OR trading (piracy was also a thing but forget it unless you have top-notch gear) but Elite has way more depth. When you put your behind (♥♥♥ isn't that bad, come on Steam?!) in the seat of your Sidewinder the first time the cockpit WILL confuse you and that's all right, Elite has a very steep learning curve. But as soon as you begin to understand and get a feel for them you'll be amazed at the degree of control you actually have of your spacecraft! Targeting systems, power distribution, scanners, sensors and much more!  No matter what career you choose there's bound to be a lot of travelling involved and not all that much combat unless you seek it. But these are not negative facts, i'm stating! The controls are very 'hands-on', whether you use mouse/keyboard or some form of controller input, meaning that it doesn't get boring supercruising around (also, you might want to be on the lookout for pirates). And about the not-that-much-combat-point: it just makes the combat so much more intense when it does happen. Also this game would probably grow quickly annoying if your cockpit-glass got busted by some 12-year-old griefer, putting you on an oxygen-tank and a 5-minutes-race against time to not suffocate everytime you enter a new system.  I warmheartedly recommend Elite: Dangerous, although mostly to people who are into RPGs, space-sims and the like. Like i said: it's not an easy game to be a newbie in!

The first thing I want to say is that this game throws you in at the deep end. I have relied heavily on Google to teach me how to play this game; from knowing how best to warp through systems, to figuring out how to collect mined materials.  The tutorial missions teach you the basics of how to fight &amp; fly; after that you're on your own.  HOWEVER, the more I play this game - the more I understand how it works; the more I enjoy it.  Between the disappointment of No Man's Sky and the seemingly endless wait for a substantial release from Star Citizen, I was desparate to explore space. I knew about Elite Dangerous from a while ago, but had heard that it lacked content. I checked it out again to see if had changed, and realising it had improved, I jumped in.  It may not be what Star Citizen promises to be, but it's a fully fledged game that is fun, immersive, and addictive. There is so much depth to this game and I can't wait to explore further. The fact that I'm 11.6 hours in and still haven't begun to scratch the surface speaks for itself.  You can mine, trade, fight, and explore with different risks and rewards for each. The size of the universe is immense, and the graphics are beautiful (running at max with GTX 970, 16GB RAM, i7 4770K).",

            "review_text": "Alright so I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the graphics and how it somehow sucks me in with its long dull moments. There are so many things you can do (all time consuming). So if you don't like time consuming games then this isn't a game for you. It is also hard to start out. Which is why alot of people don't like the game. They think it is boring and takes too long to do anything since they don't know what to do or how to get started. I read up a bit on the game when I was having difficulties getting started. I also had 2 friends that like the game to help me out with the bounty hunting. I mean sure the game has its problems such as what happened to my friend just last night. We were bounty hunting in a hazardous extraction site. Of course there are 2 things to watch out for here: High bounty wings and invisible asteroids that blow you up lol. Most things I don't like about the game are just because its a bit frustrating losing all your bounties and exploration data when you die, but I think it wouldn't be fair if you kept them. I love the many kinds of ships you can get also. Currently I have a Cobra MK III. I'm still starting out so I haven't gotten much money. The Cobra is good for everything you can do in the game. I aim to get a Diamondback Explorer next. Oh and I love the bobbleheads they are hilarious to watch. So really this game has its ups and downs, takes a long time for everything, and has its glitches, but all around I think it is an awesome game and can't wait for more to come out. Even the surface landing it really long but accurate. Now to conclude, I do not recommend this game to my friends right now because so many of my friends hate it that have tried it. So look up video reviews, play on a friend's game, or read up on it before you decide to buy and play it. Unless you are like me who buys a ton of games I don't even touch haha. Good luck to all those that buy the game or are already playing.",

Then we have Star Citizen in the corner, with all those promises and the ridiculous ship prices to keep it afloat, and how SC Devs listens to the community.  What do we have now.  ED a game that has somewhat a base of a game with the Devs going in their proposed direction. Just like a country, you cant make EVERYONE happy. The season passes' price might be abit of a jerk move but lets be honest, how is ED gonna get its funds?   SC a great game which at the time of this post looks more like a huge promise. Sure, you can argue that it has a working ALPHA, but they have alot of goals to reach and tons of bugs and optimizations to deal with. And sure, the SC Devs listens to the community. But if you keep listening to the community, which by the way, has a metric ton of ideas; some of them conflicting with each other. When you reach one community goal, another one pops up, how are you going to finish the game then. This is like having a classroom where the kids makes the curriculum and the teacher just sods off. Sometimes you need a leader to steer the class in the right direction, even if the students likes or does not like it. 'OH NO BUT YOU DONT HAVE TO BUY THE SUPER EXPENSIVE BIG SHIPS', okay, im cool with that. But is it at the stage where ED is? The answer is NO.   So I have the ultimate solution:  Play ED and when SC is ready in the year 2020. Then switch to that.  Oh. And i forgot. SC is a pledge. If the game goes boom. So does your ships.

People scoff at the game, saying its only a big grind fest and I've heard the game is as vast as an ocean, yet deep as a puddle. It's true in some sense, but the ocean is quickly becoming deeper with every patch deployed. More and more features enable more avenues of gameplay as time goes on.  Want to be a trader, miner, or bounty hunter? The first season had you covered. This is getting boring now and you want something new? Second season adds in surface missions, SRV driving, and now even Passenger Missions. MMO's are about playing with other people, progressing through the game and working your way to the top. Elite offers you the chance to define your own goals to make progressing in the direction you want towards the goal you choose. You can even do it with a group of friends. Whether its making enough money to buy that cool ship you've always wanted, or to find something no one has seen before, the point of the game is what you make it.  When I first bought the game, the lack of direction was definitely a roadblock for me. I did missions and gained money, just to climb the ladder of getting better and better ships. There was no real reason to do missions for one faction or the other. I think joining a good group of people out there helps give purpose and helps direct and focus your game play in the direction that you want. Personally, I joined the Wolves of Jonai and found it somewhat comforting that I had a source to ask questions to, get opinions and chat with while mining or jumping from system to system. A private group is a good source for a quick fleet up if you want to go bounty hunting with someone else, to take on bigger targets, or to just make the grind more bearable.  Elite Dangerous is a beautiful game and even with it's content as is, the value you get from it is what you make it. It offers a great setting to role play in, and a great community to be a part of. Although the game is a bit of a grind, it's like they say, it's not the destination that's important, but the journey.",

            "review_text": "(With horizons 2.2 ) It's hard to mak a review of this game.  I think that nowadays, with youtube in our hearts, there's no point on talking about graphics, you can judge them for yourself in any of the videos. So let's talk about what elite is and it's gameplay. Elite is a Milky Way simulator. Yeah, that sums up quite well. But you migh not understand yet. It means it has almost a 1:1 scale. Thays how big it is. And now that we know where are we playing, what can you do? You get thrown into a Sidewinder, which is your first ship. And no one tells you what to do. I think this is 'the big mistake' of this game, because unless you search how to play the game, you might get bored as the mechanics are so complex, you will get lost and frustrated.   But if you play it for 4-6 hours and look for some info (the community of this game is just one of the best i have ever seen, there's almost no toxicity and there are plenty of TS3, forums and other ways of asking veteran players who will be helping you most of the time) you will start getting the hang on it. You will start not hurting when trying to land or not running into an asteroid, and you will feel satisfaction when you start performing some nice entrys to a gateway.  Now you will start looking for missions. You will find there are some that are easier or more proffitable, but probably more boring. So don't fall for that, money will come, just have fun. It's true that it can get grindy, but this game almost simulate a job, so you have to spend hours in it. Now my big advise comes: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU REALLY REALLY LIKE FLYING SIMULATORS AND SPACE. Thats what you are going to be most of the time. Flying and traveling, jumping from system to system and exploring some new types of stars and going to extraction resources sites where you can mine some minerals and kill some wanted players.  And when you are bored of playing on the sky, you can always go and land on a moon and start driving your SRV looking for some crashed ships with cargo, attacking planetary bases or looking for rare materials for upgrading your ship. Seriously, it's impressive how satisfaying can be driving the SRV.  All that we talked about it's what i call 'bubble gamplay'. The galaxy it's not full of life. It's almost empty. All stations and human life gets concentrated in what's called 'the bubble', which is a region of the galaxy, with a radius of 500-600 light years. When you are bored of doing missions you can always fit your ship (you will have a new and better one, like the famous asp explorer, the most played ship) to be an exploration ship and go discover new systems and planets, find neutron stars which boost your systems or get nearby a black hole and watch the 'lense effect' for yourself. If you are the first one to scan a system or plantet, and you survive to the multiple refuellings you will have to do to come back to the bubble, you can sell the data to get some real good amount of money and get your name on the side of that system, so every one now who got there first.   There are also comunity goals to do, which are quite dangerous because of pirates, but you know, no risk no reward :). If you like space sims and flying sims this is your game, it will feel lonely some times, but just come to any ts3 of elite dangerous players, you will see you are not alone and you will start finding some players all across the galaxy. BTW, if you see a player while playing in open play and it's on a much bigger ship than you.... try to be friendly on the chat and run, do not try to fight because in this game, SIZE MATTERS.",

Elite Dangerous is a space 'sim' game that offers you a variety of ways to play and explore a literal galaxy. To sum up the gameplay in its barest form, it comprises of 'Progression to your next item.'   This isn't a bad thing, you can take the universe in at your own pace and progress through the sights and views and gameplay slowly. However, if you're just in the game to rush through to get your big ship, I suggest to not buy this game.  The depth of what you CAN do with any ship is the same for the starter to end ship; there's just not a whole lot different. Sure you can fight different enemies and have more modules to do things, but it doesn't fundamentally alter how the game is played. If you do NOT enjoy it in a small ship, you WILL NOT enjoy it in a BIG SHIP. Elite Dangerous is supposed to be a simulation game that simulates progression. However, you can very easily make it to the end game ships (most of them) in less than a week if you look up the guides that break the high paying missions repeatedly.  However, that's not the gameplay that represents the best of Elite. It's the expanse, the views, and the sense of what you're doing that matters most. The first few hours of exploration and discovery of the game and its mechanics are the most rewarding. Don't ruin it by focusing on what's 'best.' Which is precisely the problem with the active community that fuels development.   Avoid the forums and other places of discussion; this is all you'll hear about. Also, avoid guides. The game throws a lot at you off the bat but any gamer worth their salt should be able to work their way through game mechanics without hand holding tutorials.",

If you're looking for a tough as nails space sim with absoultey no direction and blood curdling frustration if you try to dive in: here you go.   I only have 10 hours as of this moment, but i watched my roommate play this game for a long time, so i guess i came in more prepared than most. Elite dangerous will make you fall in love and hurt you for it.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, tryin to dock in kini is hilarous online, and if you're going to jump in, i ♥♥♥♥♥ heartedly reccomend watching the youtube tutorials   edit, 700 hours, one new relationship and 200$ of computer periperals to fly my ships later:  If you're expecting to find more than a simple tutorial on how to shoot another ship or land yours, you shouldn't buy this game.  If you're looking for direction, a vivid and stable quest-line shoved in your face, you shouldn't buy this game.  This game does NOT hold your hand. This game gives you a short tutorial on survival and throws you out into the deep abyss of space. Kremainn and LHS 3447 are wonderous places to begin your adventure. If you're smart you'll get the hell out of there. If you're in OPEN play, pirates just love to grief noobs.  I'd wholeheartedly reccomend solo until you get your wings under you.   all of that being said, the game is beautiful. Powerplay brought a fun swath of content and npc factions that fight amongst one another. You can pick a side and fight it out or trade your way to riches and an anaconda.  See you in space, commander. o7",

            "review_text": "EDIT: Who did I upset? Super Frontier fanboys or Super Anti-Frontier Fanboys?   I recommend this game, but with several conditions and notes of caution for potential buyers; you need to understand what you're getting with this game and more importantly what you're not getting.  I've got roughly 560 hours and I've thoroughly enjoyed most of the time I've spent in this game.  I wouldn't, as some might be tempted, take this statement as a contradiction of the many others with large hour counts that feel the game is a grind and lacks content and excitement.  Those people have good reason to be saying what they're saying. I'm not discounting or even necessarily disagreeing with their assessment of this title, don't take it as such.  Some amount of the hours I've logged has been with friends, hunting bounties and doing missions. A portion also must be in trading that I've done, either in moving cargo here or there in missions or in buying low and selling high.  I've had relative fun doing these things, but it's not, as others have said, something you could really do for hundreds of hours. At least not genuinely, perhaps only as part of the grinding process that is inevitably soul-sucking.  Don't buy this game expecting lots of varied, exciting or new content. My advice: pick it up when it's on sale, just the base game, preferably $20 or less.  So why do I still recommend it then?  Most of my time in the game has been in exploration. I've taken two separate trips to Sagittarius A* in my ASP and will likely go again in an Anaconda.  As some might legitimately point out, the exploration is no more exciting or novel than the rest of the game's content. Perhaps true.  I treat it as a way to relax. Space is vast in this game. 400 billion stars. Beautiful, too. I can listen to music and just enjoy the beauty of creation, scanning in planets, stars and black holes.  System to system, listening to music and just being alone with my thoughts. I know this is horrifying to some but I love it, and it's hard to find games perfectly suitable for it. This one is.  Sometimes I might put something else on, maybe the actual radio, a podcast, maybe something funny like youtube recordings of talk-radio in GTA IV. Regardless, something to play that's relaxing, pretty, but not so low-effort that I might as well be doing nothing.  Maybe I just played CS:GO and I'm coming off a really frustrating game (or a really good one). Often, it's hard to get your head focused and clear enough, coming off of something really intensive and draining like Counter-Strike, to play a different game -- you can't stop thinking about the game even well after it's over.  Perfect, I can just play this. I make progress towards larger goals, reaching the core/increasing my explorer rank/put my name on systems and planets/get a better ship. However, I do it in a relaxing way, exploring space and listening to music.  Further, I pursue a lot of the exploratory goals for their own sake and not for those grinds, which are basically in the background while you're exploring. Reaching Sagittarius A* is a good goal in and of itself, just for the achievement of having done it and the commitment required -- I don't need to justify it through the grinds.  It's actually a great combination, as I can relax with the pretense and awareness that I'm still pushing towards bigger things within the game's framework.  Whereas if I play something as or more mind-numbing like 2048 or Solitaire I don't get that, there's really nothing. It's relaxing and mind-numbing the way other games like that might be, but it's also incredibly beautiful and carries the framework of a larger world with big goals to work towards.  There aren't many other games that match this description perfectly, and it's definitely something a person could use now and then.  Without any pressure, I look for things on the galaxy map I might find interesting, systems that might contain intriguing planets, stars or stellar remnants and plot a route. In each system I scan the star, scoop for fuel, check for any planets that might be worth anything and then jump. I can, if I'd like to, just go check out any planet or object that just seems interesting to me.  It's not like there's any rush or I'm competing with anyone. There are definitely more efficient ways of earning money in the game.  Moving towards the core, it's beautiful and a testament to the size and scope of this recreation of the Milky Way to slowly see the galactic background change over hours and hours of play, jump after jump.   A distant nebula in the background, hundreds of light years away, slowly coming closer and closer until you're right next to it and it covers most of the screen. A sector filled with Class A, B and O blue-white stars, illuminating the background brightly.  The lighting in this game, along with everything else, is gorgeous to look at. Hard not to take screenshots.  It's sometimes fun to piece apart the planetary data, think about just how habitable or uninhabitable a given place is given what the game tells you. Or think about what a surface might be like that is entirely water, apparently has life, but barely any atmosphere. Let your mind and imagination wander.  How much you enjoy exploration might be somewhat dependent upon how much you're willing to suspend your own disbelief.  Once you've reached your destination or start heading back you might even start feeling a little homesick and desperately want to get back to populated space. Remember, this is a fully-recreated galaxy, these trips can be long. I took somewhere between 1-2 weeks on my 1st trip to the core.  So, that all being said, let me reiterate what this game, regarding at least its exploration part, offers: A great way to relax and do something that is enjoyable, lets you get lost in your thoughts, but still requires some concentration.  Some days, and I can't imagine I'm alone in this, you just want to play something you know you'll enjoy but won't take a ton of effort, concentration or thought to get into.  It's the kind of monotony I love and appreciate every once in awhile, the kind you really like and need on some days.  I can think of dozens of different games, both singleplayer and multiplayer, that are great but require a great deal more effort and concentration. If I'm feeling particularly worn-out on a given day and don't feel like investing a great deal of energy or thought into something, then this is absolutely perfect.  Maybe I just don't want to deal with the toxicity of a multiplayer game or just want to be alone. Maybe there's a singleplayer game but you don't remember where you are in the story at all, been two weeks since you last played it, and it's 11PM already and you just don't have the energy or resolve for it.  Again, perfect -- play this.  For some, understandably, this is a dealbreaker. I'm sure, to some, it seems like I'm criticizing the game more than praising it.  To be clear, if you're not looking for what I'm describing, if you're looking for more, don't buy this. If you come in expecting that from this game, then you'll love it.   Sometimes, this game is exactly what you need at the end of a long day.",

As silly as it sounds, my favorite thing to do in the game is fuel scooping, after jumping into a new solar system. This is where you fly near a star(Sun) and collect Hydrogen by flying at close proximity. The visuals are beautiful to say the least.  Also i think its important to note i play exclusively with Oculus Rift. This is important to note, because other players have reported when using the Oculus after playing on a high resolution screen, the Oculus feels like playing on a Gameboy.

I figured at the system right before the destination I'd most likely find a gas station. Turned out that there was no station, neither gas or any other kind but there was just two planets. One that was scorching hot that I was introduced to as soon as I warped into the system (This game is insanely beautiful by the way), the other was a dark and purple unexplored planet that was classified as 'neotoxic'.   I tried making my way to the purple planet because I was low on fuel at this point and I figured anything was better than giving up, right as I was about to reach that planet I ran out of fuel and lost powers to my thrusters, my warp drive, and everything else in the ship. By this point the oxygen was running out and my character only had 5 minutes of oxygen left, as it was going down I could hear my character breathing and I had to sit there for 5 minutes while alt tabbed watching videos on youtube whilst hearing a man almost gasping for air and on the brink of death. By this point I knew there was no way I was coming out there again so I decided to abandon the quest and now I have to pay a 5000 credit fine for the items I did not return or deliver in my cargo.

I don't play ED to grind, I don't play it to be competitive or try to be the best. I play the game as a adventure, and as if it was real. I don't rush myself, and I personally do not like the grindy feeling of trading. Sure, it is the easiest way to make money. But I enjoy doing what I want to do.  The reason why people find Elite Dangerous has no content is because they play it as a grind, trying to make it to the top as quickly as possible. If they did what they want to do, instead of what they feel they have to do (make money) then they would enjoy it. Sure, ED IS lacking on the content side somewhat, but it doesn't mean you can't have a lot of fun just exploring. I personally play as a bounty hunter, in my Diamondback Explorer. But I do a little bit of everything whenever I feel like doing it, and whenever there is a oppurtunity to do it.  If you want to play ED to get a Federal Corevette as fast as possible and battle everyone, you probably aren't going to enjoy the game. Take the game at your own pace, and don't rush it.   If you expect a lot of things happening, dogfights everywhere, tons of players dueling it out, you'll be dissappointed. In a 1:1 galaxy, finding another player is rare. But when you do, it feels special. You don't brush them off as just another player, you think of them as someone who has had their own adventure building up to this point, and of which you are so lucky to pass by in such a huge world. Player interactions feel special.  TL;DR. Play the game how you want to play it. Don't play it to grind. Play it to have fun. Finding other players is awesome. Set goals for yourself. (My current goal is to get an A-rated ASP Explorer, and then make my way to an A-Rated Python.)

There's also quite a fun trade system, and the PVE system can be fun as well; however, I haven't played around with that as much.  There is a PVP system as well, but I can't speak to that as I've yet to play in the Open World.  I really enjoy that you can play in a Solo mode, and still be connected to the servers with the galaxy changing around you based on what other players are doing, and can still participate in online events and change the galaxy yourself. Essentially you just can't see other players. You can also play with a private group, all the same stuff, but can only see the people in your group. Or you can play in the Open World and see every player doing the same.  This setup is great for people like me who don't enjoy PVP, though I might prefer if you could simply join in the Open World and disable PVP.",

To make it crystal clear:  There is nothing to do in this game except what you set out to do. Nothing to achieve (apart from arcade'y ranks), barely any story to discover, no characters to hate or fall in love with, not even ridiculous Steam achievements to earn. Nothing will move your lazy behind except you yourself. If you dig into it, you will spend most of your time flying arround empty and instanced space or drive arround on empty planets in a rover that will make you think very fondly of the high-precision MAKO in Mass Effect.  I do not understand why I play ED. I do not understand why I even bother to write this review, because ED is the most stoic game ever created, yet it has a magic to it that makes me load it up every now and then, just to put on my earphones and listen to the epic sounds of space travel. To bask in the glory of the stars, which remind us of how little and unimportant humanity really is. The arrogance of the human race with its petty squabbles about doctrines and religions dwarfs to an atomic size when compared to the galaxy that surrounds us. No sci-fi movie or TV show ever managed to capture space like ED does. No documentary will ever be able to show you how big space really is like Elite can. (Edit: The Expanse gets pretty close.)  Do I wish Frontier would add more actual content? Hell, yes, but at the same time I am glad they are not going down the easy road of other MMOs. Elite Dangerous is not a space opera. It is not a space shooter. It is not a space adventure.  It is space. And lots of it.  (I played this game for roughly 100 hours since Beta, made it into the middle ranks in everything but Arena and a total earning of about 100m in bounties and trade before adding my key to Steam.)",

The ships are well designed and very detailed in how they operate and function. They even have signes saying 'caution hot surface' and other little marking all across the ship on its various surfaces where engines and weapons come out. They also have very detailed sounds to their engines and when you activate certain devices or go into warp. You even hear the metal hull of your ship creaking as you accelerate or activate the boosters.  Although it is very immersive and behaves like a space simulator it has a level of grind to it. To get my favorite ship the Imperial Clipper you must fly to Emperial space which is at the bottom of human colonized space in order to take missions from the empire. When you complete enough of their missions you can get another mission to be promoted in the empire. Each rank requires more missions and it builds up with each rank as it goes from outsider, serf, master, squire, knight, lord, and Baron.(It goes even higher than this all the way up to King.) And the Clipper requires the rank of Baron to buy it. This grind drives people away from the special faction ships and some of the largest ships in the game like the Python and the Anaconda which cost into the millions (or hundreds of millions in the Anaconda's case) and thats not counting their repair costs when they are destroyed.  But the game also features a close quarters combat game which is arena player verses player with the smallest ships in the game. Currently there are 3 game modes (Deathmatch. Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag) and 3 fighters (Cougar, Eagle, and the Sidewinder.) to play around in. They have planned to expand it in the future and the games reward you with credits, experience to your CQC rank, and new loudouts to use in the games. You are also loaned the ships so you don't have to worry about dieing and paying a repair fee.  There is also Powerplay which i don't recommend when your new to the game as it gives you ability to ally yourself with a organization and/or person in the galactic theater as you try to foritfy your control systems and expand into empty or occupied space for your power. It is time consuming and your under constant threat from rival powers as they regulary knock you out of warp and give you a hard time.  Overall this game is fun and time consuming as well as frustrating if you lose a lot of credits due to you losing a ship to a bunch of pirates or a hostile force, but it keeps you coming back as you earn money, rank up, and try to become the best pilot in the galaxy.",

Things have changed thankfully, docking and landing is a much  smoother affair and the graphics really are excellent. Astronomers and sci-fi types will love this. It is a space sim of epic proportions, a recreation of our own Milky Way to go and explore and as a simulation it does take a while to learn all the controls and how to get the best performance from your ship.  I can fully recommend a third party program called VoiceAttack, learning the controls by just shouting at my ship  for a couple of hours saved me from memorising a long list of key commands and after purchasing a voice pack called LEO, my ship talks back to me with the voice of Holly from Red Dwarf. For extra immersion a HOTAS setup is perfect and if you are lucky enough to have a DK2 then you are now in space sim heaven.  Slow going for new starters, there doesn't seem like much to do. I didn't really get the hang of it for the first day or two but take whatever jobs you can and look out for opportunities as you travel about and before you know it you are in the right ship for you with a half decent loadout and looking to upgrade almost constantly. You will either be mining, bounty hunting, trading, smuggling, a pirate or a mixture of all of them (although you can't really mix mining with anything as it is more of a life choice like being a deep sea fishing boat captain, its a calling and not to everyones taste).  There is now an expansion called Horizons which adds planetary landings and a surface rover vehicle for tearing about in and extra content like different mission types and ships but it is on the pricey side, if you own Elite Dangerous already then Horizons will cost you £29.99 it is up to you whether you would pay that much for extra content. It is by no means essential and if you are a flight sim/Sci-fi person with a DK2 lying around for a tenner you are getting a bargain.   ",

            "review_text": "Ive only put 40 hours into the game but I am seriously impressed with what I've seen. I played the original Elite on my trusty old Acorn Electron back when I was around 8 years old and later went on to play Frontier Elite 2 on the Amiga. I remember seeing the Frontier Elite Intro on the Amiga Format cover disk (3.5in floppy lol) and the very next day rushing out to buy my copy. I played Frontier Elite 2 for years, easily must have put close to 1000 hours into the game over the years. Jump to the present.. I really wanted to get the Elite Dangerous on the games release but didnt really have time to play due to life being busy and lack of free time. Well after having a few days to myself I thought ♥♥♥♥ it and I picked up Elite Dangerous in a sale. As soon as I played E.D I felt exactly like I had years ago when I first played Frontier Elite, I'm hooked, the game is truely amazing. At the minute I've done a bit of trading, bounty hunting and exploration. I'm slowly saving my credits to buy a decent ship. Cant wait to try my hand at mining.   Now I have to admit I was a bit disapointed at not being able to land on the planets like you could in Frontier Elite but I could let that go as I have been having such as good time playing.. but I have just seen the videos on the latest DLC coming where you can actually land on planets.. wow.. take my money now..   For those of you who are thinking of getting Elite Dangerous, if you played and enjoyed the previous games then get it. You wont be disapointed.",

            "review_text": "Had been meaning to try this game for a while, and bought it about a week or so ago. It does have some points that need adressing which can be adressesd and then it has 1 main point that needs addressing which i dont think can be addressed with the way it was designed.  But I reccomend it.   Now, this game will probably not be for every one. To start it it will help if you traditionaly like flight sims, and it will really help if you liked sid meirs pirates. And it would be a added bonus if you like space stuff, like star treck or star wars etc. but i dont think the latter is essential.  It is mainly a cross between a flight sim and sid meirs pirates 'only set in space 1st person view'  to start it you will have a reasonably useable space ship to use this thing is free so feel free to get killed as many times as you need too in that. because it is free and you wont lose any thing because of it.  I wanted to be a space pirate All i wanted to do was jump in start stealing peoples goodies and then fly off with my ill gotten gains. Turns out you have to work up to that And as you work up to it the thought of possibly loosing what you have worked up to makes you re consider your game plan.  So i have ended up being a smuggler Im reasonably happy being a smugglker and have not allied my self with any one And i will smuggle anything any one wants any where if the money is right.  its pretty fun, and quite addictive.. it is one of those games where you think.. ok il just drop off these slaves/narcotics/guns(whatever) and call it a night. You dock and go to hand over the slaes and you see a different mission heading some where els for quite a lot of money. So you say ok il do that one too.. and that happens 5-6 times and next thing you know its 3 hours later and you are in the outfiters buying the next upgraded gimbled laser gun with your proffits.  I also 'at times' decide to buy stuff from the market at 1 place and take it with me to sell at the next place. this can be reasonably lucrative.  Allong the journey from a to b you will often get attacked by space pirates. being terrible at keeping some one in my crosshairs i kitted my ship out so it could run away and not get exploded. but if i was any better at shooting things i would have chosen to kit it out for max fire power.   now the issues..  You dont really seem to have an effect on the universe even if it was advertized as you would be able to.. Does not effect my enjoyment of the game, but it may factor in for oothers.. (i do think this can be fixed if they try)  There is no reall supply and demand Well there is but its a constant.. you cant take a millon tonnes of food to one place and then the guy behind you with food finds out that they will only offer him 1/5th of the price he expected. (again i dont think that would be much of an issue to fix either)  And NPC traders.. they dont really do anything. you could kill every single one of them on a trade rout to any specific place you liked. put up a full embargo and not let a single npc or human player through with supplies. and some how they would still seemingly be resupplied. (again fixable)  Then thers the reall issue its kind of hard to find reall humans. You do find them sperodically 2-3 at a time sometimes just 1. and there is no universal chat room to find out who is where and doing what.  this issue i dont think can be fixed due to the way the game was made.  in any given system there can be 16 people at a time. if 16 people are already in that system and then you go there, the system you are in will just have you and any one else who tried to enter the one with 16 people.  So a universal chat really cant work as you could say im over at cupis come and find me. and only the 1st 15 people could be in the same system as you. every one else would be in cupis but not the same one you were in..  I personally thing if each system could hold 100 or so people at a time that should eliviate issues like that, But then you would have huge traffic jams at docking stations due to not having enough docking spaces..   But the long and the short of it is, i would reccomend the game even with its flaws IF you liked sid meirs pirates and flight sims. it is a nice blend of both. Even if the issues arent ever fixed its still worth playing. Hopefully they will fix the issues that can be fixed which will make the game much better, if you can effect who controlls each area depending on your actions and who you decide to help that could vastly change the game dynamics by forcing people who are alies to a diferent faction to counteract your actions.   You can look at the game as it has potential, you can look at it as it should have been more, or you can look at it for what it is right now and accept that even how it is now its still enjoyable provided you enjoy that sort of game. I personally do. So its reccomended.",

If you are looking for a curated and adrenaline fuelled cinematic gaming experience where you quickly progress through a story arc that makes you feel like an important and powerful part of the galaxy without any personal initiative or imagination on your part, then it will not be the game for you. If you are looking for a sandbox space flight simulation where you feel like a mewling newborn kitten; cold, confused and alone in the blackness of space, leaving it up to you to forge your own path through the galaxy, to create your own meaning, and even then to remain an insignificant speck of dust in comparison to the majesty of our Milky Way, then it will probably be the game for you. If you are looking for a game that gives you a clear direction and straightforward progression and then objectively rewards you for following the clearly marked trail of breadcrumbs, it won't be the game for you. If you are looking for a game that is almost too subtle, where months of dedicated action may result in a single blurb in a GalNet news article as your favored minor faction expands into a new system, if you are looking for a game that provides an atmospheric experiental sandbox, then this will be the game for you. If you are interested in maximizing your profit per hour so that you can 'beat the game' as quickly as possible, you are going to be left with your wang in your hand. If your idea of a good time is to haul loads of ♥♥♥♥ across the blackness of space because it pays the most fake space bucks per hour, no wonder you didn't enjoy your time playing Elite Dangerous. If you are all about the destination, and see the journey as naught but an annoying grind, then this is definitely not the game for you. It is definitely the game for me.",

With the 2.2 patch it's definitely coming along and the game is getting far more conveinent to play. They are finally adding QoL features such as module storage, and the ability to transfer your ships and modules from other stations to the one that you are in, provided it has the proper facilities.  It's worth the money, but a couple critical things to remember: The game is not infinite in depth. You have to create your own goals/endgame, it can get a bit grindy, and, you need to be willing to try things that might not sound interesting to you. Take it slow, and don't be afraid to ask for help.",

At first i found it very hard, and took me 2 hours to figure out how to set the controls to what i wanted. After i set up my controls to make it comfortable to fly, i began doing missions and all that. watched allot of videos on youtube to find out what ships were best for combat and bounty hunting. saved up and bought the eagle and upgraded it as much as i could. spent 10 hours or so saving up to try get the viper MkIII Traveled 50 lightyears or so to finaly find a station that sold the viper (at that point i had 330K/CR to buy the ship, and upgrade it) Finaly got to the station after about 6 hyperspace jumps. Bought the ship and upgraded it with 3, 2F Fixed pulse lazers, and a machine gun (trying to save rn to get better guns)  Went to combat zone, took forever to kill 1 ship then realised you dont get money for doing that, just wanted to test out the ship, seemed alright exept i need much better guns the lazers dont appear to do much damage.  Thats my review, if you like grinding allot but getting good rewards afterwards then get this game.  also gotta love it when you're fuel scooping at a sun, and you get interdicted and the escape vector aims at the sun so you get pulled into the sun and have to fight to get away and not die  8/10",

            "review_text": "I am a big fan of space related games, especially ones that grant you the freedom of flying wherever you want to in the world provided to you. Elite Dangerous definitely hit the sweetspot for me with the freedom the developers have provided in it. There are quite a variety of ships (so long as your in-game wallet and faction rank will permit) and I've enjoyed trying out a few different ones; I am greatly looking forward to making my way to the larger ships. (Edit: please not that you cannot buy anything except for colors and cockpit oriented decor with real money; this game does not have any P2W elements that I can detect).  There are a variety of jobs you can perform in this game and you are not ever 'set in stone' with any particular job. For instance, I began as an exploration pilot by equipping my ship with some stellar scanners, a planetary scanner and a good FSD (Frame Shift Drive; e.g. warp drive). After that, I made a few modifications to my ship and now do small ship transportation for civilians to other stations or planets. In addition to this, I also have another ship that is being outfitted for space and planetary combat missions.   There is one thing to note. You can play the game in a few ways: -Solo (Only you and NPCs are in the galaxy) -Private (Only you, NPCs and invited friends are in the galaxy) -Open (You, NPCs, and everyone are in the galaxy)  The importance of this is this... I HIGHLY suggest NOT playing in 'open' until you are fairly confident with your piloting skills and your ship, or if you have a good set of wingmen on hand. You may be killed by Player-Killers just for the heck of it and although you will regain your ship so long as you carry the amount of credits necessary for insurance...it just sucks to be killed so brutally. On that note, there is a bit of a learning curve for the piloting in this game but if you keep at it long enough, it becomes more natural of course.   In any case, If you want to know more about this game, I highly suggest you check out some videos, broadcasts or just go to the developer's website.   As for my opinion on the game, I highly recommend it.  **Edit: I nearly forgot, if you can, playing this game with a friend or two makes it vastly more entertaining. It is fun by one's self however, being able to co-op missions and such not only makes them more doable, but also brings a great sense of cooperation.",

It is not a perfect game, however, and potential players should be very aware that there is no campaign. There is no real goal or objective at all, save those that you set for yourself. Though you can run missions, they are not fleshed out, but rather simple objectives followed by landing at a specified location - they are random and they are not voice acted like the training levels.  The game is essentially a grind for in game funds to get bigger ships. The hope is that you enjoy the activities that you are grinding, as the amount of detail put into the galaxy is stunning and most activities are entertaining. If you are enjoying whatever you are doing to make money, it does not feel so much like a grind, and I think that all commanders will find something to love here.",

            "review_text": "This is, quite literally, the game I grew up wanting to play.   In this genre, I came of age, through the years, on Wing Commander, X-Wing, TIE Fighter, X-Wing Alliance, Descent Freespace, and Starlancer, in addition to a plethora of other non-scifi flight sims. I somewhat fell off the wagon there, largely because of, in my opinion, the flagging quality of space based flight games (on PC) from the early-mid 2000's until now.  To start off, I'll not say anything about Star Citizen, which I contributed to several years ago, and with which I am becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of availability of a contiguous and comprehensive game. But anyways:  I found out about Elite: Dangerous roughly a year and a half ago (well after the kickstarter had closed). At that point, it was still in beta, and I said to myself: 'Self, asking 70 republic credits for a game that's in beta is somewhat exorbitant, isn't it?' And so, I waited. I watched some let's plays of it on YouTube to vicariously experience the gameplay. It looked pretty cool. When it went GA towards the end of 2014, I got it day one.  I booted it up. 'Tutorials are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And anyways, I've watched a bunch of gameplay video, and am a very experienced flight sim gamer. What's the worst that could happen?'  I crashed pretty much immediately. Protip: Do the tutorials. Steep learning curve. But I enjoy a good hike.  Once I got through the basics, I set out again in the universe. I still remember my first hyperjump: The FSD whining as it charged up, the crackling noise of spacetime itself distorting, the thump of jumping into witchspace, the whistling song of things Not Of This Universe, and then dropping back into realspace with a resounding BANG as a star rushes up towards you and literally fills your canopy.  As I put more time into it, I optimized my keybindings, and began to understand some of the more nuanced space combat tactics. I started as a trader, then progressed to bounty hunter, went on an exploration mission (made about 60M), came back to do more bounty hunting and community goals, and now am doing long haul trading/smuggling because it makes me feel like Han Solo, even though I have other 'better' ships parked all over the place at the moment. Can your combat/trader fit Asp Explorer do the Sothis run in less than 320LY, go toe to toe with anything but an elite pirate, run from the rest, an still make a 4-6M profit per run? She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts.  This is what I wanted, all those long years. It's so good, and it makes me happy. And Frontier is, as we speak, expanding the gameplay and making it do more things. This makes me even more happy.   I don't play it as much as I'd like to (life + work, sigh), but I unequivocally enjoy the time I do spend in game. There are lulls, but I always find myself coming back to it, and having fun.   Moar protip: turn up the sound on your first play.   Now if only someone would make a proper successor to Nexus: The Jupiter Incident...",

I undocked, couldn't figure out how to move properly and got blown up for loitering. Then I figured out how to move, got stuck in the obnoxious mail slot and got blown up for loitering. Giving up I quit the game and went back to playing something simpler, for instance programming a small script to filter out my emails based on how often they used buzzwords.  The next day I was at work, things where busy compiling so I watched the training videos mostly out of pitty for the poorly designed game. Back home, I logged back in and gave it another shot. This time I got as far as flying to the next station. Requested docking several times, which was ignored, but turns out I was just not close enough. Finally got close enough, requested docking and tried to land.  Suffice it to say I improved the email script to actually score emails on the buzzwords they used and give me a daily report of how buzzy day had been. Next day, more videos out of curiosity this time, got back bought a docking computer and four tons of narcotics. Jumped to the next system, got interdicted by a pirate and blown up. Did you know that each industry has it's own buzzword collection? I figured that if an email from a different industry was using cross industry buzzwords it should get a higher score.  More videos later I learnt the submit, boost, high wake(this will all make sense if you played the game a bit), and back home I was armed with this information. So I did my same trip again. Got interdicted twice, survived twice, got to the station. As I was docking with the Docking computer, I got scanned and blown up for carrying illegal goods. I shared my script and created a small service so me and my work colleagues can keep a score of who had the most buzzwords. This I would later regret.  Turns out it is quite easy using online services to find out what is and isn't illegal. But more importantly you can sneak into a station using a feature called 'Silent Running.' I'll skip a day and spare you the story, if you forget to put it off your ship overheats and explodes. So the day after I finally docked and was ready to sell my narcotics only to find out it wasn't in demand anymore. Side effect of making a competition out of buzz words? Work colleagues using more buzz words in their emails. Took me three hours to decipher a mess of an email that was asking me to review something and was overloaded with 90% buzz words.  Fast forward two weeks, I fly into my first sun. Fast forward four weeks, I crash into my first planet(yes, I got Horizons). Fast forward two months, I make my way to an exploding star 6 thousand lightyears away. It takes me three days. Fast forward four months, I convinced most of my friends to get it too.  To sum up. The game is brutal, unforgiving, marvelous, beautiful and fun.

I should add a note about the community - I was driven to write this review ultimately due to an act of common kindness in the game by the group called The Fuel Rats. They rescued me from own stupidity and saved me millions of in game credits by rescuing me thousands of light years from inhabited space. They do this all the time and for free.

Get your rep up so you can get whatever the next better thing is. The devs are dragging out the release of whatever alien content will be added to the game. Over 2 years after release and a major DLC and still no aliens to interact with from what I understand. Just puzzles/mind games for those ingrossed in the game to research. These aspects are not the entertainment I am looking for.   One good quality of the game is that there is no subscription so buy the game on the cheap and see if you like it.

Instead, you can fly around and do whatever you like: bounty hunting, trading, mining, exploring, missions, manipulate the (excellent) background simulation, pledge allegiance to various powers, etc. This game was built to sink hours and hours into, but you have to be self-motivated to continue playing (I want to buy a Pyton, or I want to find 100 Earth-likes, or I want to reach Elite in Combat ranking).  There is a significant RNG grind to certain aspects of the game, but I haven't encountered the issue myself yet. Frontier listens to the community fairly well (better than most developers) and community itself cares a lot about the game the other members of the community.   With a 1:1 scale of the Milky Way (including all known stars and galactic features), this game is amazing for budding space enthusiasts; I only wish it had been released in its current scale 10 years ago. I highly recommend this game to single-players who enjoy space and enjoy sandbox games.",

They aren't kidding about things taking hours to get to by thursters alone. -'Realistic' physics. I can't tell you how many times I've shot my target because I didn't brake enough in time. -No subscription. NOT pay to win. The cash mall is entirely vanity. --Bobbleheads in the vanity mall! :D -Choice between MMO, party mode and solo play. --MMO is open world where everyone can play --Party mode is like a private server but the 'host' doesn't need to be online for you to access it, just need them on your friends list and get invited to the 'server'. --Solo.. That's pretty much self explanatory.  Cons: -No story line. (See edit) -Utterly directionless upon log in. -Controls are not very intuitive. --See EVE: Online versus Microsoft's Freelancer. --Recommend using a flight stick! (No, I don't have one but my friend does and he's running circles around the rest of us mouse/keyboard types)  Biggest Frustration: -Controls are not left handed gamer friendly. Left hand on the mouse, right hand on the keyboard.  Misc: The best way, I think, to have fun with this game is kind of a two fold concept. First, know people before going. It helps because the tutorials are not the greatest. Second, know what you want to do. In other MMO's, I PvP all day, so getting right into the fight for that level of fun made it easy for me to launch my ship and start hunting down NPC's that are incredibly intelligent and other players. I have friends who play on EVE, WoW and FFXIV, whom sit around and play the markets all day; so I think they would enjoy being a cargo hauler. Read some of the expansion notes that is in the early access. Omg. Want.  Edit: Okay, so after two weeks since I left this review, I have discovered that there is a kind of real world story line going on. So it's more like political over tones that have actual in-game consequences, such as the ability to dock at stations and prices that you get from goods. Many factions battling for control of known space. Each in their own way and you assist in your own way. Some through propaganda, some through blatant warfare. Each with their own perks and bonuses. Still, so far, the game follows EVE's more real life 'storyline', you have to forge your own path and know what you want to do and what you enjoy as you explore the galaxy. Still having a lot of fun exploring and I'm currently outside of 'civilized' space, but there are a few.. Uh.. 'Free', read possibly pirate, space stations around to sell and buy from. And traveling to a system that isn't controlled by my faction, flags me and them as the enemy. So must play nice.  Lately, I've been playing this on my HTC Vive. I love it (both the Vive and this game on the Vive). A lot. Although the text and HUD's are really grainy and the words are hard to read. Lowering the default display from 1280x780 to 1080x700 helped a lot with being able to read the text, but still a bit grainy. Yes, this game does give me motion sickness, but oddly enough, only when I am flying around in deep space and decide to start doing barrel rolls and aileron rolls. Spinning around in combat or dodging asteroids doesn't really cause me any motion sickness. Maybe it is because my attention is focused on other things?  A big con for this game is this: The game rarely closes properly for me since a recent update. I do not know if this is because a file was corrupted or if it is my computer, but I end up having to go into my task manager and crash the program manually. Doesn't matter if I am playing in normal mode or VR mode. Steam validate system shows that the files are good and nothing needs to be fixed. Any thoughts?",

I have had some really amazing moments playing this game yet those moments clouded by much of the grinding that is required. In a way I found much of this fun (especially bounty hunting) as you earn credits and hone your skills but it is definitly a grind. The game can feel very empty and many people complain about the quest system being shallow which I agree with. This is the hugest game you will ever play but you may find you have nothing to do but grind credits for that next ship you want. With the introduction of CQC getting pvp matches is much easier and I think it adds value to the game. Keep in mind the expansion is coming out though and cost $40 extra later.",

In EvE, it's more about player-to-player interaction. If you tried to play EvE and not talk to anyone, you would get bored fast. That being said, Elite Dangerous has that same level of interaction, but with player-to-NPC, I hope to see more of a reason for the open play option, because frankly there really isn't one except to collect player bounties.  Even with no reason for Open Play, the game is still great in solo! The universe is just as persistant and ever changing in solo mode as it is in multiplayer. There are just as many choices and paths to take. The icing on the cake here is the AI coding, it is amazing! The AI does basicly everything the player does, and changes the universe as much as the player does. They trade, mine, bounty hunt, explore, and pirate. Those are just a few of the things I can think of off the top of my head.  I surely would recommend this game to anyone looking for a space game with no subscription fee and still get the same persistant universe you see in other games like it.",

            "review_text": "ok this is my take on someone who has not played space sims since the wing commander days and genrally I'm more of a casual gamer these days .now I thought this game was going to be easy for beginners, sadly its not and there is soo many controls that its confusing which one you need to press when you needed, and the missions and how they are orginzied at the beginning is dreadfull, since you get mostly mining ones or bounty ones, but with the start ship and only 1000cr its difficult, so you end up basicially flying around till you see a station that has something you can actually do to start earning credits.This is defiantly a game you need to take your time with, after 3-4 hours of finding how the ship controls work and the various menus ect.. the game is starting to open up, so the learning curve is difficult if your not used to these types of games.after around 5 days I already had enough money to buy a better ship and equipt it with pretty good weapons and sensors ect.. Now there is still alot to figure like mining for example(I know how to mine) however how to mine things you really need for missions , I do not understand.And the main one combat I also don't get, when the shields are down its a breeze but if someone has there shields up and good grads, mann! you can through 30 missiles and blasters at it and hardly a scratch.This needs a little optimization at least when you have a mission or start missions for beginners that the guy has a shield you cannot penatrate. But would I recommend this game 100% yes it is amazing and my time flies in this game as everything is n realtime even when you close application, so you have to be carefull when taking missions , since you can come back 2 days in the game and have lost the mission.Still have alot of things to figure out in this game and if anyone could help be out on the combat side how the best way to destroy this hard to destroy shields would be great.",

Once you get the ship of your dreams, you're going to be burnt out because you spend days and weeks grinding to get it.  Go into the game with an open mind. Let the game take you places. I know that sounds cliche and cheesey, but it's the truth. You start with the cheapest ship. Try a little of everything. Take some missions. Maybe smuggle some things if you want to be a rebel.

Find something you like doing and stick with it until you want to change, or until a community goal comes along that you are interested in.

Still, to really get into this game and learn all its systems, expect to read a 100-page manual and watch about an hour's worth of Youtube training videos.   After you get past the initial hump, however, countless doors open up. You can trade, bounty-hunt, explore uncharted space, participate in combat scenarios as a mercenary, and even wage territorial wars as a loyal follower of a galactic faction. After a while, you start to realize that this game is really a Roguelike. It encourages you to risk and fail often. The penalty for failure is trivial, and you get to keep any money you have managed to earn in your failed run, enabling you to buy new ships or equipment that will make your next run easier. The main game loop is fun and addictive, no matter what kind of a job you take on.  Before this game, I could only get into mission-based, campaign-driven space sims like the X-wing series and Freespace 2. Open-world games like Freelancer or the X series never hooked me because they did not have clear objectives. Elite Dangerous changed all that. It's so deep and immersive that coming up with my own objectives is actually more fun.   I can't recommend this game enough to fans of the space sim genre, even if you never liked previous open-world space sims before.",

For me that's amazing value for money.  Graphically this game is among the best I've ever seen. The first time you warp to another star system you'll ♥♥♥♥ yourself. Same with binary systems that have 2/3 stars orbiting in very close proximity, I was legitimately awestruck.  The thing is, despite how many roles you can play (explorer/trader/pirate/bounty hunter/miner) it does get slightly dull. The procedural generation does mean that you can visit countless systems that nobody has ever seen, but the vast majority of them will look identical to the last 10 systems, possibly a white dwarf here a blue supergiant there, but once you've seen all the star types it loses a lot of the magic. Also eventually you'll get tired of all the roles and trading is pure grind so if you don't like that you'll have a very hard time getting enough credits for the high end ships. The world itself though is totally cold and lifeless. You never see a human, it's just spaceport after spaceport and there are only 3 types of those.  I definitely reccommend this game if like me you're a huge sci/fi &amp; space nerd, because it really does feel like you're flying your own starship.  I don't have horisons so I cant speak for that. Arena is a disgrace though, I spent 10 minutes with 'Searching for Session' on screen while watching youtube on my 2nd monitor. Total garbage, and people know it so nobody plays it.",

            "review_text": "Firstly I'd like to state something I haven't seen too many people write.   The game itself is really simple to get into, might take a bit to get used with the controls and how the mechanics like 'Jumps' between systems work, or how cruise mode works - and how the balance of speed and vector (Direction of entry) balance into things. It's a simple game, and with fairly simple mechanics - however, it has great depth despite this. Which to me is Elite: Dangerous's strongest suit.   I looked up a few things on the forums and some of the youtubers I follow (Scott Manley, Jingles.) But that was more after I learned of the basics on my own - overshooting my destinations, flying into stars, being blown up by Police and pirates. But the visuals always kept me in awe for the first few hours, and being given a free ship, albeit a really weak one, encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them as you go on.   The wonderful part about it however, comes in play once you've begun learning the ropes of flying around, exploring and how to begin your climb of power. It does its job of a sandbox well, and with the expansion of Horizons you can further the depths of the game, and merely landing upon a planet with your outfitted space-buggy can end up in an adventure on its own.   1. If you enjoy the deep complexities of the X series, this game /might!/ be something you'll come to enjoy a great deal, and I say might because as it stands, you won't have an army of NPCs serving you, instead that option becomes a part of the online experience.   2. If you are a fan of space sims and games in general, I'd highly recommend this game, I've put up about 30-40 hours of gameplay as of the writing moment, and I haven't had a single dull moment so far. I would stretch that it is a space game, and most of space is empty between spots. This is due to Elite's fairly realistic mechanics, and ontop of that you have an entire galaxy to explore, places where no one else have visited before you.   3. Don't be afraid to fail, it's the best way of learning a lesson, but be careful with what ships you fly, as they can get blown up, and if you're not in your starter ship, well, you might realize you can't afford the bill of insurance.   Lastly,   The sound design is amazing, the visuals are amazing, and it's a game I highly recommend for anyone into the Sci-Fi Space Game genre.   TL;DR : It's like the old Microsoft game 'Freelancer, but far, far superior as a game.   ",

            "review_text": "Personally, I think this game is the kind of game that isn't for everyone and takes some effort to understand properly, but once it clicks for you it becomes one of the best Space Sim games out there. I get that the reviews have been 'Mixed', but I honestly think that's only because a lot of the people reviewing either didn't give it enough of a chance or realized that it wasn't for them and decided to speak for everyone. I'll admit that there are several parts the game needs to do a better job of explaining and that 'space trucking' to earn money can get a little repetitive, but once you find the explanations the community has produced you'll be fine, and some people actually like repetitive, drawn-out, totally uncomplicated tasks. Just look at how popular Euro Truck SImulator is.  The gameplay is very open-ended and you can play the game however you like. The three main categories of playstyle are Combat, Trading, and Exploration. Combat is your standard zero-gravity dogfight with other ships, whether piloted by NPCs or by other real players. I reccommend waiting until you have enough money to upgrade your ship a little before going down this road and being careful who you target once you do. Trading is pretty much just Euro Truck Simulator in space. This is probably what you'll spend most of your early game doing. It can be hard to tell which commodities will turn a profit, so you may have to rely on third-party websites, but figuring out what trading routes make a profit without any external help is very rewarding, even if you don't make quite as much. Exploration is going to starsystems and scanning everything you find, then selling the data you collect for money. It takes a bit of doing, but if you outfit your ship properly you can explore the entire Milky Way if you like. There's also CQC, or Closed Quarters Combat, which is a slightly tougher variant on regular combat with its own ranking system completely independent from the rest of the game.  The controls are one of those things that will make more sense with time. If you've ever played a flight sim, you can probably fly in ED just fine. (There's even HOTAS support!) I keep hearing that docking at space stations is one of the hardest parts of the game to learn, but I never had any trouble with it. Maybe I just learn faster than others, though. One thing you can do to make the controls a little easier is buy a third-party application called Voice Attack and use it to bind controls to voice commands. I would advise against depending on this, but it does make things a lot easier. Regardless, wrapping your head around the controls is the first big hurdle you're going to have to overcome to enjoy this game.  This is the part of the review where I'd delve into playing with other actual players and forming wings with friends, but I play in Solo Play mode and don't have any friends who play ED. My peak of human interaction is when I play CQC, because that's exclusively player v. player. I actually like it better like this, though. Social interaction is one of those things I don't do well at, and I'm still affecting the other players indirectly. Solo Play just means that I don't see any other real players, despite the fact that we're all playing in the same universe regardless of what mode we play. I don't know, maybe you'll like the Open Play mode. I can't really offer an opinion here. (Note: Solo Play doesn't mean offline play. This game is always-on and you will need an internet connection, even if playing by yourself.)  I should probably point out that (at the time of this review) I don't actually own the Horizons expansion. I plan on getting it in about a month when the Summer Sale hits, but even without the features Horizons adds this game is definetly my current favorite. It helps that Frontier keeps updating the base game while still releasing new features for season pass holders. Is there a bug you found in the base game that impacts your gameplay significantly? There's a higher than usual chance that bug will be patched without having to pony up for the expansion, especially if you let the devs know about it on the fourms. If you're on the fence about buying Horizons, look at the official website for the list of features they have already added and that they will add further down the line, keep in mind that you don't actually need any of them, and decide for yourself whether it's all worth an extra $30.  In short, if you can stick with a game long enough to begin understanding the deeper parts and you like the idea of Euro Truck SImulator in space with the occasional zero-gravity dogfight and the option to explore the entire galaxy along the way, you will probably like Elite: Dangerous. It's not for everyone, but those who do enjoy it enjoy it immensely.",

If you're still around after reading/seeing the large number of the negative reviews, you should ask yourself some questions.  First, are you interested in science fiction? Elite Dangerous is set in space, so if you said yes, you've come to the right place.  Second, are you interested in space flight sims or otherwise flying around in space? Elite Dangerous involves flying around in space, so if you've said yes, you may enjoy the game.  Third, are you anywhere okay with a tad bit of grinding? The game may require you to do some tasks for money, but you may advance your gear with the money. If you said yes, you should be fine. Just realize you don't always need to grind. Your mid tier spacecraft is fine. 30-50 million credits will get you a decent ship in combat or exploration. Trading, too, if you're into that.   Fourth, do you min/max (i.e. only doing to most profitable task in order to achieve the highest tier gear)? If you said yes, you'll bore yourself. Note my wording: YOU will bore YOURself. That's not how you enjoy this game. You enjoy the game for the sake of flying around killing/exploring/pirating/space-trucking. If you don't like that stuff, then that's fine. But this game will not be fun if you min/max.  Fifth, do you think you are entitled to any content developers release for their game? If you said yes, you might be disappointed. Horizons adds the potential for so much. And it will not be the last expansion. It's fine to wait to see if what they add to the expansion will be worth your money, but just because this game doesn't conform to a total of $60 doesn't make it a money grab. It just means it costs more.   Sixth, do you have friends to play with so it doesn't feel as empty? The game can get a little lonely. Friends can help. Maybe a player group can help, too. Not essential but makes it a little more fun.  If you're still iffy on buying this game, do one of two things:  1) buy it and play less than two hours. I'd set a timer for an hour and a half so you don't go over. That isn't a lot of time, you'll only have enough time to do the tutorial and maybe a mission. But if you like the feel of the physics, and you like the look of gameplay on youtube, you'll like it. If you don't like it, steam refunds will work. If somewhere after two hours, the novelty wears off and you want out, don't regret it. Look on the bright side: the game might interest you again after a few updates.  2) Wait. Give it one year. July 2017 maybe. EVE Online started iffy, too. Now look at it, so many players! If Elite:Dangerous is like that, congrats. If it isn't, you can invest in some other game.  I love this game, but I understand it isn't for everyone. I love hearing traffic control over the radio. I love watching things I kill explode. I like seeing the face of the faction that gives me my missions.. I like watching my credits balance go up, even though my next ship upgrade might be nonexistent (what can I say, the Vulture is a good ship)  Please don't listen to the angry reviews. They're disappointed in a game that doesn't exist. They review based on what they wanted in a game, not what the game is.  I hope I see you in the black, CMDR.   --CMDR SlickMaw  ",

            "review_text": "Elite dangerous Is a science fiction game that attempts to give the player the freedom to do as they wish in the ever changing galaxy (our own milky way galaxy set appr 1300 years into the future) From the very begginning, the game starts you off with a small ship in a large space station and 1000 credits at your disposal. From here, you are literally given the freedom to do what you want. You dont need to worry about handholding, convienent objective markers. You are given nothing but your ship, and an xyz coordinate map of the galaxy (Which is absolutely mindblowing how much there is).  So what Is there to do in an expansive galaxy such as this? There are a wide variety of things that you can do. -be a bounty hunter by looking at each space stations 'Top Five Bounties' list to track, kill, and return to claim the bounty for a profit  -be a trader by buying goods at the local market and sell it elsewhere for a profit -be an explorer and travel across systems in the galaxy, then return for a profit by selling data -support a faction by doing missions in Powerplay. (lots of credits recommended) -be a space pirate by going to systems where traders come and go. Intercept them for their cargo. If they surrender, the plunder is yours and you can sell the loot as your own. -be a smuggler and take illegal goods from one station and bring it to another undetected for a profit.  There are also a wide variety of ships to purchase to help out in what you want to make of your experience. Currently there are 29 ships with more on the way as the game gets more updates and content.  If your a fan of popular science fiction genres like star wars, mass effect, or even star trek, or just want to enjoy the freedom of smuggling, fighting with spaceships, helping a faction, exploring the galaxy,etc, then his is the game for you.",

You can play online, mmo style, or solo (semi solo actually as you still need to be online) and mine, explore, trade and/or hunt.  Well, that's the theory. In practice open-ended means you're thrown in a galaxy to do what you please. There is no main scenario. There are missions, which most of the time don't work. There is not much else, except for you making your own adventure. This can be fun, for some people, sometimes. Other times it's just flying around without a sense of purpose.  I would love to say ED is a great game. Unfortunately it's one of those games that you might prefer to read about instead of actually playing it. I had some 30hrs of fun trading so far, slowly going for better ships and better modules for my ship. But it's not the usual fun, it's fun as making complex transformations in Excel is fun, in other words it might not be fun for everyone. Apart from trading I tried combat, but I'm a pacifist. I tried little exploration and will follow this path later, might provide me with another 30hrs of fun, or I'll just move to Evochron Legacy... Still, I would cautiously recommend this one.  I liked: * simple flight model (jets in space) * nice graphics * it's a space sim game! * you need to do some research to really enjoy the game  I disliked: * learning curve is quite steep * you need to do some research to really enjoy the game * missions are of the worst mmo kind and to top it off they are borked most of the time  Get this: * if you want to fly in space and watch the views * if you think you would enjoy Euro Truck Simulator in space  Don't get this: * if you need to be driven by plot or missions to do stuff",

Seriously, there's like a million of them you can visit, and I'm not exaggerating so look it up.  You're given a ship it's loaded with basic stuff. Then it's really up to you to decide which direction you want to go. There's no skills or career trees to speak of, mostly just certain ships are better in some areas than others. You make your own way in a large, cold, brutal galaxy with other players doing the same. Want to be a pirate or a pirate-killer? Gear up your starter ship with some better weapons and head to conflict zones. Want to be a miner? Maybe buy a transport and equip it with a mining laser. Want to be a smuggler? Give a ship some killer engines and some cargo room.  There is a 'Bulliten Board' with randomized missions at just about every space station you encounter, making it a little guided for what you choose to do. Think contracts you accept based on your own interest. Some you can't do if you're not aligned to a faction or don't have a high enough rank in either combat, wealth or exploration experience.  Few games have that actual feeling of 'I'm just trying to make a living in the vastness of space' more than this game.

Get shot at and then I activate warp speed to get out of trouble. I stop by stars to refuel or every time I am at the stations, usually pick up new contracts right as I turn in finished ones, so back into space I go. I tried mining twice, probably the most boring experience in my life, and the HUD doesn't label asteroid you already mined, so that makes it confusing when flying around and they all look alike. Mined resources are only really valuable if you pick up a contract for them, if you mine without a contract you can only sell them to the regular market which gives you much less money than giving them to someone in need that offers you a nice juicy contract.   Okay the driving on the planet part was a little odd at first, had to reassign controls to my xbox360 controller to make it work right. It's fun, but getting missions done sucks. There's a lack of a sense of direction of where things are. The radar on the planetary vehicle is a hit or miss but you get the hang of it (center the thicker signal lines in the middle of the scanner and drive towards them till something shows up in person). If you get lost you can summon your ship, Unless your ship is parked at a docking station, I had to go after it which was weird considering that I parked it a few KMs away from the station but it went and parked itself in the station after a while.  Bottom line, Planetary vehicles are not worth $40 And then again the whole game is probably not worth $50-60, there's just not a lot of actual fun stuff to do. Space is pretty boring, mostly empty. You can fight people, you can mine, you can deliver loads, and just fly (often times for too long that you might fall asleep) the game gets repettitive very fast.  HOWEVER I still recommend it as it is damn near real life in space. It get repettitive, sure, it may not be worth the price tag, sure, but you just cant find a better game anywhere else that simulates space so well. The accuracy of humans as a space faring civilization in Elite Dangerous is incredibly accurate. (except warp drive, that is the only magic in the game)",

            "review_text": "I've been playing this game for a while now , and have enjoyed every single hour. I basically never write reviews but the sheer amount of negative reviews this game has pushed me to writing my own. This is my own perspective of the game and I highly encourage you to go and try this game on your own despite how bad the angry reviewers make it seem. Now then , on to the review.  [Story / Senario]  Elite Dangerous puts you in the cockpit of your own spaceship and throws you into an hostile galaxy where pressing the wrong button at the wrong time could very well mean death. There isnt a story behind the game like what you would expect from games that feature a single player campaing. What you get instead is a living universe , where you can join different factions to fight for their causes , Governments trying to take over the galaxy ( which you can also join ) , A dynamic economy that enables you to trade goods from a station to the other. This is one of the selling points of this game : You can do whatever you want. With that in mind , dont expect to go exploring the deepest part of the galaxy right after starting. You will most likely spend the first few hours running errands for various factions until you can exchange your starting weapons with literally anything else.   Basically , Elite lets you make up your own story. You are not the main protagonist of some epic journey accross galaxy where the faith of the universe resides on your own hands. Many people seem to dislike that while this is the reason why many people enjoy this game even more. Elite makes you very aware of how insignificant you are compared to the vastness of space , and I love it for that.  [Gameplay]  There isnt much to say about the gameplay that would give you an idea of what actually playing the game feels like , but I'll try. This is a simulator. While being a simulator , dont expect FSX levels of simulation : Its still a game , yet plays as a simulator. The right mix of difficulty and fun makes up for a quite unique experience , something I had yet to experience in a game. Even mundane tasks like requesting docking after arriving at a station is something I never get tired of , except when I forget to do so and enter the station without authorization , only to panic and boost into the side of the station while trying to get out in time.  This game ( or series rather ) explores a new level of Open-World gaming. The entire galaxy is a 1:1 representation of the milky way. You can spend days wandering around the galaxy , scanning stars and planets. The first time you pop open the galaxy map will blow your mind. Many people seem to dislike how it could take you days to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other and back. I doubt they understand how freaking huge space actually is.  As for missions and content , this is where most people bash the game in other reviews. Yes , the game does lack some personnality when it comes to missions and interaction with other NPC ships. Their dialogue is quite limited and most often than not missions have the same description , the only thing different being your destination/cargo/target. While this is a small part of the game , many people seem to crave content. I dont know what they expected out of a game that lets you make up your own story.  As for what you actually do in game , some of your time will be spent flying around trying to find good spots for whatever you are trying to do. Again , people seem to hate how you have to find stations that have good ships or good modules , or find systems that have extraction sites or combat zones. Its like they expect the game to shovel food directly into their mouths. While it is true that the game isnt very good at explaining how things work , it shouldnt be too hard to figure it out on your own. Yet that seems to be too hard for many people.  Once you figure out how the game works it shouldnt be too long before you make up a role for yourself. I was selling space weed for a while before I finally got my Vulture. Many would consider this to be grinding and sure , if you only play the game to get to the bigger ships , its going to feel like a lot of grinding. Which is why you shouldnt play this game expecting a reward , because its the quest that's satisfying. Returning from a 20 hours long journey accross the galaxy might only get you a couple million credits , but its having your name on those first discoveries that's satisfying. Its not knowing what to expect every time you jump into a new system thats thrilling.  [Graphics]  Absolutely gorgeous. Even when playing on medium/low settings using my old 5850 , this game in incredible looking. I love taking screenshots when I stumble on binary star systems orbiting insanely close to eachother or when I end up visiting a nearby nebula and find a gas giant with rings. Everything about this game looks great , even down to the interface in your cockpit which , by the way , you can change the colors to fit your desires.  [Sound]  Absolutely mind blowing. There is nothing to say that could give you an idea like looking up non commentary gameplay videos on youtube. Crank up the volume and enjoy. The soundtrack is very well done as well and fitting to whatever you are doing since every activity has its own set of soundtracks.  [Pricing]  Now , for the most annoying point of this game : the pricing model for extensions. The developpers expect players to pay for a full game every 'Season' , which is basically every year when they release a new set of features for the game. Now I will gladly pay the full $60 games usually come at for the full thing every year , if only the content they released was equivalent to the price. So far , Horizons doesnt live up to the $60 I've paid for it. Its a shame really , that older customers who support the developpement will end up paying more money that those who wait for the game to be complete before paying.   However , since this is a review for Elite Dangerous , dont let that scare you. The base game without Horizons is worth its current price. You just might want to consider waiting for future extensions , if paying up to $100 for a game scares you.  [TL;DR]  What are you waiting for ? This game amazing. Dont be scared by the negative reviews written by angry players who cant make up stories in their mind or cant even be asked to try and figure some things out on their own. Elite Dangerous will give you a unique role playing experience you are not likely to forget any time soon.  [EDIT]  700 Hours in and this game still blows my mind. Dont listen to the haters.",

            "review_text": "Firstly I must express how delighted I am that Elite: Dangerous is back. The first game was truly fantastic and this one carries that forward well. However. I have seen a LOT of negative criticisms for this game primarily aimed at the devs not caring for their community and also that the game can get tedious after a while.  From what I've seen of the devs they seem more interested in adding more content than fixing what they already have. However they are not the worst devs in the world and the game is really quite polished.  As for the game itself - as an avid astronomer - this game is brilliant for me! Almost everything about it is true to science. From the physics of spaceflight to the gravity of planets to the perceived evolution of Humankind, it is all totally accurate. But the thing that tops it off for me is the merticulously put together galaxy map, true to the Milky Way in all its grandeur.  And yes, it is a slow game. The real galaxy does not constantly try and kill you, people are not always on the offensive and political wars are not all guns and missiles.  I don't want you to go into the game with the wrong expectations. There are plenty of other space sims that are not as slow that may be better for you. Star Citizen for one. Space Engineers also has planetary landings and primarily sandbox gameplay. If you don't mind retro look out for the X series.  Overall there are pros and cons; Realistic galaxy, complex political battles, detailed history and optional full physics (Flight assist: off) are all examples of upsides in my opinion.  The questionable history of the developer includes shady business strategies and occasional indifference. These I consider a prime examples of downsides.   For me though, it does not negate buying this game. It should be said that I bought this game at a 50% discount. I advise you to do the same.  There are skins and odd extras available via the Frontier website but please do not confuse it with Pay2Win. There is no major advantage to be gained with a thick wallet (a few multi-part missions that I would avoid). It is therefore 'Pay2LookGood'.  Know what you're looking for and buy on sale if you feel it is compatible.  5/2/2016 - Edit: Yesterday the devs announced that Horizons (planetary landings) would be released as a DLC season pass instead of a new game. They also lowered the base price from £40 (£30 if a previous owner of E:D) to £25. Don't bother with the Starter pack. This proves that they do listen somewhat.",

I have a Cobra MK 3 with a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loadout, and just under 130 hours.   I'm going to write a review anyways, ♥♥♥♥ you.  So, I had oneday found myself an elusive pair of 20's, and had some cash to burn. Naturaly, I went straight to Steam. Now, I need to dive into a personal anecdote. I am a massive Sifi fan. The whole space thing is super sexy. A little ship, some fancy lasers and a the entire galaxy to do said space ♥♥♥♥ in. When I found Elite, I had nearly blew a hole in my pants.   The fist few hours in this game are terrible. (Sorry, WERE terrible. I just went through and found some tutorials that actually help. Thanks for keeping me in the basement a little longer Frountier) I found myself in a little Sidewinder with a fuel tank the size of a raisin, and decided to jump straight into the unknown. I didn't even make it near my destination, because I had a rather uncomfertable meeting with the local sun. I died, died some more, and finally, died a once again leading to a rather large heap of ship-carcass in the station. But for the few minutes I wasn't flining my ship at a side of a wall, I got a good look at some other ships. Seeing other people with these huge, amazing ships, I wanted a taste of being an intergalatic badass myself.  Jump ahead 100 hours, I have a new ship with a cool snake name, and some missles, some other bits and bobs that I picked up along the way. I met nice new people; the ones who didn't kill me. I start to play with my new chums, and we start to race along dunes, play chicken in old ships and pester the local athorities.   My new pals constantly pestered me about exploration. I had thought that all it would be is wandering around an empty wasteland of balls of hydrogen and space pebbles, with the addition of my previous attempt at being a space pilgrim. I couldn't be more right. Exploring new, undescoverd places was so addicting, and in my opinion, relaxing. It was just me, black, some suns, more black, and my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends who didn't warn me about white dwarfs  Alright, ♥♥♥♥. Started to get off topic. In my opinion, Elite is a fun, relaxing, and stressful game that I couldn't love more. I was so happy to have gotten a space sim about space ships and not crappy actors hidden behind playdough models.  In conclusion: This game was fun  ♥♥♥♥ you &lt;3",

            "review_text": "TLDR:  Elite Dangerous: Horizons is a flawed masterpiece. Beneath all the polish are some issues that need to be worked out, but all in all the final product is a solid entry in a genre that is sadly lacking good titles. It is a slow burning game that is meant for those who are willing to fully immerse themselves and will not hold the attention of those hoping for a quick fix.   FULL REVIEW (Written for  WakeandGame.com)  The Elite Dangerous base game is itself still the main component of the title. Space flight between planets, space stations, and star systems will still be taking up most the time spent playing, and it will be a lot of time. Flight is broken down into three speeds and it can take some time to master shifting between these. The lowest level of flight, reserved for fighting and landing, is the easiest to maneuver in but wont get you from one planet to another in your life time. The second level is meant for traversing distances inside of a star system while the third is meant for going between distant stars and gives you no control at all, which is fine since the sense of movement is really just a fancy load screen.  It is transitioning from the second level of speed down to the first that will give you trouble. Managing speed is critical to successfully reaching a destination as you approach it, which can lead to overshooting and having to swing back around often. It is a minor issue and one that will become less troublesome the more you experience you gain.  Experience is everything in Elite Dangerous. The longer I played the more I enjoyed the game. The tutorials are useful and will save you a lot of headache but even after completing them there is a lot to learn. It can be frustrating when starting out and you have no idea what to do and there in lies my biggest issue with the game.  While the open ended choose your own path game play is exactly what I wanted, it does leave the game feeling somewhat aimless. While you attempt to discover what you need to do to advance in the game you will come to realize that you don’t really advance. In terms of hardware you can certainly purchase an impressive and satisfying variety of ships, but you will be making up your own story as you go. Since there is no narrative to speak of Elite Dangerous can quickly lose your attention if you do not have an immediate goal. Fortunately there are plenty of goal to set for yourself.  The players who will get the most out of Elite Dangerous: Horizons are those who are willing to invest some time in it. Since there is no direct narrative guiding you there are a limitless number of ways to play. You could trade between stations, making money by providing things to distant worlds for a premium price. You could hunt bounties and just fly around the galaxy hunting down the most wanted criminals for huge profits. You could be a miner and gather resources to sell for a hefty profit. It is up to you. This also meanS that fatigue will set in quickly for those who are easily bored or need to given clear goals. Some players are sure to find that the lack of a clear direction gives them too many options and leaves them confused about what to do next. Learning how to accept jobs and make money can be daunting at first and many players will likely lack the tenacity to see it through.  When you are running short of things to do you could always just take a sight seeing tour. The visuals in Elite Dangerous: Horizon are often spectacular. The rings of a gas giant are filled with millions of space rocks, stars have shimmering and roiling surfaces, and planets are immense and humbling. Weapon effects are colorful and fun while delivering a satisfying feel. Ships explode in great detail and that includes your own if your not careful. The first time you see a capital ship enter a battle it will drop your jaw and it only gets better as you approach and examine that massive ship. There is also a LOT to explore. Since it can be hard to scale right in a game like this Frontier Developments just made the galaxy to scale. It is a truly impressive feat and one look at the map screen will show you just how many stars there are to find. You could spend years just trying to visit every star in this 1:1 recreation of the Milky Way!  Once you find a planet with something interesting to explore you can land and take your fancy moon buggy out for a spin. The transition between space ship and space car is seamless and smooth. I found the controls to be very difficult to get used to but otherwise I rather enjoyed the landings. On the surface you will be subjected to differing levels of gravity, depending on the size of the planet you land on. There are a variety of places to visit on planetary surfaces. Some are natural, some are artificial and many are hostile to approaching craft. They are often defended by turrets and drones that will try to kill you as you approach. Should you manage to make it through, however, you could find some good loot, making the reward worth the risk.  ",

The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a game of this genre, the sound effects and music score are perfectly timed and atmospheric, the missions and paths to making money get boring real fast. The other players are mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags who enjoy shooting you for no reason EVEN if you are a fresh spawn with a new ship and NO CARGO. The multiplayer role play is non-existent, you either stay out of other players way or you get engaged like it's CoD or some other ♥♥♥♥ game! I love PvP , but when you're being attacked by every human player in sight for no other reason than a lol kill, then you're better off playing solo.

It makes a huge difference that I get to have the Elite game experience without having PVP or grouping forced on me, unless I want it. I can troll around for a fight after I've been to the pub without anyone around to see me crash into the space station drunkenly.  If there is anything that needs beefing up for a modern audience, then it's the lack of an in-game tutorial. There were more than a few WTF? moments for me in the first few days that were unnecessary. I shouldn't have to read stuff online to learn about in-game essentials or mechanics.  The other criticism I have is more to do with the brain damage I have: there is quite a bit of text and I can't find where to increase the size so I can read it.

However I didn't get a chance to play it much until around December 2015.  I expect I missed a lot of the various bugs and complaints about the game, so this review is what it's like NOW (early 2016) rather than at release. Which means I'm not jaded in opinion with it's earlier issues.  Would I recommend this game? Well YES, but you must be aware it's a BIG game and has a fairly big learning curve to be able to play it well.  I didn't find the in game tutorials that great, but there are LOADS of fan made You Tube videos that do a much better job of teaching you the game.  This game is a slow burner for me, which means, overall I recommend it, but I don't really play it unless I have a large timeframe set aside to play it, like 4 hours + in one sitting.  I will however be playing this game for years to come I expect.  I love all the controls and it runs very well just using a mouse and keyboard, although you need to customise the controls to get the controls just right.   If you want a fast paced space shooter, then this probably isn't for you. The combat looks slower to me than say the up and coming Star Citizen, but it suits my tastes and feels more tactical. That is a personal opinion of course.  Multiplayer is a bit weird, as if you want to play on the open server with friends (and everyone else) , it can be a bit of a hassle to get to the same instance as your friends. I'm told this will improve over time.  Personally I play in a private group called 'Mobius' which is a PvE server only, so no PvP.  It's much easier there to get friends to join you and the Wings functionality (Wings is like making a small multiplayer group) works quite well.   I'm told Open Play is quite aggressive and getting ganked is pretty common, but that's to be expected in an open play game really and there ARE alternatives, such as Single player, Private and 'Mobius' . However I've not played much Open Play, so don't have much personal experience with ganking etc.  Graphically and sound wise it's very pretty and quite smooth. It even works quite well on older PCs. My son runs it on a 4GB Dual core 2.5Ghz CPU and a mid range Graphics card, albeit with lowered settings, but it still looks pretty good. I have a newish PC and it runs great.   It's so cheap now, at the time of this review $15USD, so it's worth a try really if you think you might like it.",

            "review_text": "So having read quite a few reviews on here, I was in two minds whether to jump in on this game. I mean if should tick all the boxes for me. Space 'sim' - check, amazing graphics - check, RPG elements - check. Though all the negative reviews were putting me off. So let's pick through some of the main themes of the bad reviews and why I feel differently:-  Space is lonely: Yes you will not be coming into contact with real people that much, this is true, though the fact that I can spend upwards of an hour without PvP interaction, makes the times when I do all the more special.   There's not much to do: You will find that some space stations/ports will only have missions that you can't do (due to your levels, more on that later) but missions are only a very tiny part of this game. There is all the roles you play, smuggler, pirate, trader, miner, bounty hunter to name but a few. With the lack of a pre made story line some players, so if you see video games as a story to be told, (I.e. uncharted, last of us etc.) then you might not get on with this, but if you prefer more open games which allow you to be the one to set your own story than this game should scratch that itch.   About the dlc: I did not back this game while in the crowd funding phase, so I can not attest to what was promised and what has been delivered, though total price (at time of writing) for the game and it's season pass is just shy of £45, it's not too bad in my mind.  Finally the ship's: Yes the design of them is less attractive than other games of this genre (Star Citizen) though you won't be left wanting with the amount of customisation available.   So in conclusion: If you like massive open world games in which you are not limited by having to complete story missions and would rather carve your own narrative in a beautifully rendered world then this game is for you, if you like the idea of space and want a to just test your skills as a combat pilot, this is also the game for you, though I would possibly wait till the game is on steam sale if this is your main driver. Yes this game has its flaws, what game doesn't, though if you can see past these, you will have a incredibly rich immersive experience.",

I would reccomend this game if you want to go on long space flights and play games on your phone while you wait to get to your destination. A game that I would reccomend in place of this one would be Star Citizen. its still in alpha currently but so far, the game is fun (but small). it needs work but its a good game (both this game and star citizen). I feel like they should've taken some more time durring development to make the flight system better and more efficient. Star Citizen has it where you just jump directly to your destination which would be great if elite dangerous did this. overall, I would reccomend this game if you've got a few hours to waste and dont know what to do.",

I can now say that my fears were proven true, as I find it difficult to get on to play a solo game. This is only the first time this has occured, but it's without a doubt going to happen again in the future (perhaps not as often as it sounds in this sentence). I thought, as others will surely think reading this, that this won't happen often enough to really care. I haven't played the game long enough to contradict that belief, but that's not the point. I wanted to play alone, actually I just wanted to check something out. Due to the online requirement, I could not do something so simple. This online requirement hampers my game in the exact way I thought it would. Without a clear connection to the server(s), I am barred from enjoying the game completely.   This is the exact reason I wanted to steer clear of ED, but with the recent expansion coming I wanted to check it out - and mistakenly purchased Elite Dangerous, rather than Elite Dangerous Horizons. After learning of my mistake I thought it wouldn't be that bad to enjoy what I've got. Indeed, I did enjoy it, until recently. I realize why the developers made the decision to make the whole game online only. I read the newsletter explaining it. However, I believe they should have separated the online and solo play (offline) components. Creating two commanders, one for offline play, and one for online play. This is what was done for Diablo 2, and I thought it worked out just fine. Regardless, my limited experience is that the game is fun, though may tire out eventually (too much of the same stuff).",

It provides you with the tools to have a lot of fun although, not every one are prepared to that level of freedom. It is not a game where you will always 'walk to the right' to find and kill the the boss and be a hero in 10 min. It is a game where you will be presented with a WIDE range of possibilities TO HAVE FUN! To do that, you can:   - Participate in fast paced combat competitions (CQC) - Mine goods to sell - Make money in trading in a dynamic galactic economy - Smuggle illegal goods - Pirate traders for their precious cargo - Hunt outlaws for money (Bounty Hunting) - Influence the balance of stellar systems war as a soldier - Assassinate people to start wars on other systems  - Shift the balance of galaxy wide powers - Disappear in to the unknown galaxy to map unchartered systems  - Do those things before in missions OR NOT!  And the better part is that it does NOT end there. The game was planned to be a MASSIVE development effort and will expand to a game of incredible possibilities. Although, unlike people think, game development takes time, effort and $$$. In my way of thinking, Frontier is trying to launch modules of content that will sum to their envisioned universe. Elite Dangerous (vanilla) is a very solid kickstart that delivers: procedural galaxy, ships, exploration, combat, trading, galactic powers etc (and they did a great job!). Furthermore, in expansions/seasons, they will (or plan to) release(d) much more stuff, like planet landings, crafting, multi-crew, ship carriers, aliens, fps(walking around), atmospheric worlds and all the freedom it all provides. That is definitely a PLUS!  My advice for new players is:  1 - Learn to pilot a space ship! (DAAHHH) So you don't waste 10min traveling from A -&gt; B (that is not normal! Sometimes I take 10s if it is close) But be aware, long trips are supposed to last long. 2 - Don't be afraid to explore your 'occupation' options. Bounty Hunting, CQC, trading, exploring etc. There are several different options of what to do. 3 - Don't MinMax! There is NO RIGHT WAY to play the game. If you do, you will be bound to boring grinding.  My experience:   Tried to do missions unsuccessfully, did some BH in a Nav. Beacon , died, 'stole' some bounties from security officers, upgraded, tried to trade, found it boring, BH more, bought new ship. Nowadays, my assets are in 180M and most I made in BH, which I dig, but I also bade about 8M in trading/mining, 3M in exploring. Even did some extremely high risk/reward smuggling missions.   Conclusion:  Elite Dangerous is already a great game and tends to be even better in the future. If you play it, do not face it as a casual player that wants to beat a game in 10min. Keep a open mind and know that you do not need the best ship to have the best fun. All you need is your imagination.",

So long as you can get into a role, an idea of being someone different in this game (defining what it really means to 'play' something) then you will like this game. It is a very unforgiving game, and challenging. This challenge makes you look outside the game to forums and communities initially for help... that later enhance what you do in the game itself. The deeper you look into this game and the communities that have sprouted from this game, the more you will like it.  I've played for almost 50 hrs at posting this and have definitely NOT done everything, not even 1/10th. Probably not 1/100th.",

PVP in that regard is completely unfair in my opinion regarding horizon player vs non horizon player. for single player play or even private group play its fine but online there is no real point to playing if you cant initiate pvp on a level playing field. with that said i will recomend this game on the single player/group play experiance alone until game devs correct this massive oversight in PVP fairness.",

            "review_text": "Though at times frustrating, Elite: Dangerous is an excellent game. You can play the game completely offline if you wish; the AI is quite competent, I've found. Or you can play privately with friends, or in an MMO environment. Your experience in each mode is linked, meaning you can take everything you've earned offline into online play and vice versa.  It feels to me a bit like a first person EVE Online. Your primary goal in the game is making credits. At first, your safest bet for doing that is trade, though you can attempt to hunt bounties in your starter ship should you feel so bold. I find there's quite a lot going on in the game's MASSIVE galaxy, so once your get a bigger and better ship, you quickly find your opportunities opening up. Each system has a number of factions, each of which will be in a given 'state' at a given time. A faction's state affects events that occur in the system. A faction on Lockdown will demand cargo scans more often, making smuggling more difficult. They'll also have a lot of bounty missions for you. Factions at war will fight battles throughout the system which you can choose to get involved in on either side for a payout. These battles tend to be big, hectic affairs that really make you feel like you're in the middle of a space opera.  Should you be so inclined, there's a factional warfare mechanic in which several NPC leader characters struggle for control of the galaxy. You can do your part online or offline by helping to shore up your chosen leader's worlds, or helping their influence spread to another. Each leader offers different perks within their controlled systems for pilots who serve them, and each has a slightly different way of going about attacking and defending worlds. Each leader also offers a unique ship mod for those who serve them well.  The game has an ample amount of ships (around 20 I believe?) of varying shapes and sizes, each with its own unique look, feel and sound. Everything but the UI is quite different for each ship, making you really feel accomplished when you step into to cockpit of a ship you've been saving for over a period of weeks. There are also an exceptional number of mods for your ship, ranging from laser or kinetic weapons to point defense turrets, cargo expansions and drives that allow you to rip other ships out of warp so you can have your way with them.  The game allows you to choose your own path, when you get down to it. You can choose to be a humble trader, a resource miner, a bounty hunter, a pirate... You can even gain local bounties within systems by destroying the enemies of a chosen faction who is at war. Of course, you too will be hunted from time to time... By bounty hunters and law enforcement if you're a pirate, by enemies of your faction if you've sworn allegiance, or by pirates. There's nothing linear about these interdictions; sometimes a pirate will leave you alone if you jettison enough cargo for them. Other times, that pilot just wants you dead. Sometimes it's a little Eagle fighter, others it's a huge Anaconda warship.  I'll list the only real  CONS  in game design that I've seen, and this is more a wishlist for things that could be in the game. These are mostly personal wants, but I list them in case others are wondering if they're in the game:  - Massive battleships and capital ships. Capital ships are in the game as part of factional conflict battles, and you can pilot some pretty big ships, but the game doesn't allow you to pilot any huge battleships with 30 broadside cannons.  - Walking around. I'd love to be able to walk around the interior of my ship, but this is something the developers have said will likely be in the game in future expansions, so keep that in mind.  - NPC crew. I'd like to be able to hire NPC crew members to man certain weapons systems or the like, mostly just for immersion. At least someone to sit in that second seat in the larger ships. However, the game WILL allow those of you with lots of friends to board the same ship and man its various weapons systems together, and you can purchase turreted weapon hardpoints that will automatically track enemies and fire on them.  - I'd like to be able to construct and/or purchase orbitals, but I understand why you can't. They do however have events in which new orbitals are constructed, and players can get in on the process.  - I'd like to be able to construct and sell ships out of raw materials, either for myself or for a profit.  The  PROS , however, are myriad and far outweigh the cons. To top it all off, the development team is responsive and fair, fixing bugs regularly, replacing ingame wealth lost to bugs, and consistently producing new content to keep the game fresh.   Verdict:  8.5/10. Bumps to a 9 if you have a microphone and Voice Attack. I also recommend a joystick, but if you don't have one, keyboard and mouse works quite well once you get used to it.",

This game is visually stunning (even if you have a standard pc/laptop, awsome if you have a gaming/custom pc) and the gameplay is completly emmersive and one of the features that i do like most about this game is that you have the option to do solo / multiplayer (open world) / or private group play which i have found is unique to the game that i have played.  Though there are only handful of ships available to purchase/aquire the amount of varaitions available to do the same ship is almost limitless, though the game can feel like a grind at times trying to get the bounties or finding people for contracts(quests) it is still fun as the waiting for bounties or wanted criminals builds the intesity for the hunt of the kill.  i would recommend this to anyone who has played a cockpit sim and who wishes to pass the time away exploring, trading, bounty hunting, or pvping  hope this helps you  ",

What didn't help was that the tutorials are not very informative. I would highly recommend playing the tutorials at least two times each and tweaking the controls to your liking. The game starts out with a joystick layout for your mouse, which at least for me was not intuitive. I would recommend setting your roll to the 'a' and 'd' keys and mapping  yaw and pitch to your mouse.  Once you get the hang of it though, there is an entire galaxy (literally) of things to blow up, trade with, do missions for, fly past (flying TO is a bit more difficult), loot, and look at. You will not ever be to all of the places, so don't bother trying. Trading is fairly easy, as is doing some of the low-level missions. Consult the wiki if you are planning on doing anything more than that though. BUY A FUEL SCOOP.  Being as this game really doesn't have anything much in the way of an actual story, it is much more fun when played with friends. After playing even this much though (see the P.S.) I find myself missing some aspect of a storyline or even faction conflict. There is an overall sense of lack of purpose other than trying (and ultimately failing) to make sure that I no longer end up as an urn of space dust on some 12-year-old's mantlepiece.  In summary, I have a lot of fun with this, although there are a few things I would fix.  P.S. Disabling steam overlay for this game is a good idea as the activation key (that I've not used for a single game on steam so far) notification stays at the bottom because of a bug, blocking your notofications for cargo scoop, mass lockage, and landing gear.",

And the reason why is the same thing you will hear in all of the serious reviews of the game. It lacks any significant depth.  Let me start with the positives.   -The ships are amazing to fly. They all feel different and sound different, as well as look different and perform different.  -Combat is fun and balanced. It requires skills and patience, and is quite rewarding particularly when you manage to take down a larger ship.  -The sound design is absolutely amazing. Each ship sounds unique and all of the sound effects are absolutely superb.  -The game features an insanely in depth background simulation. In each of the hundreds of thousands of inhabited systems, numerous factions each have their own laws, affiliations and influence. A supply and demand based economy allows for dynamic variations in profitability, based on both the background simulation and player actions.  -The game has some of the best community involvement I've ever witnessed. Players influencing the economy has been a feature of many games, but in Elite the devs allow for player created lore-friendly news articles. Player created lore-friendly factions and political gameplay. Player run initiatives, and community goals which can be started and run by players. Elite has community involvement which legitimately shapes the galaxy around how the players act, and it really makes for some amazing opportunities.  -The game is beautiful and well optimised. I'm running it on a 6 year old laptop with a broken fan and I get smooth fps in almost every situation(excluding some planetary landings with Horizons)  -The game has a lot of freedom. Pretty much the only restriction that will limit what you can do will be your in game credits. Almost everything is available right from the start.  This game also has a lot of negatives, however:   -To quote a video game reviewer Yahtzee-'A game where the player can do anything is a game that focusses on nothing.' Elite lacks depth. The trading mechanics are lackluster and basic. The combat, although fun, lacks much significant purpose and become very repetitive. Exploration is also something that gets quite repetitive quite quickly, and the way that the mechanics repeat themselves just ends up boring a lot of people.  -Missions are worthless and in some cases, broken. This is going to be fixed with Horizons patch 2.1 hopefully, but as it stands missions often do little to increase someone's balance.  -The game is horrifically bad at explaining almost all of the mechanics. The first tutorial essentially tells you that left click = fire weapons and then ends. I have had this game for many months now and I am still learning about how some of the most basic mechanics actually work, and that was because I have done a lot of research into how to do things in the game.  Overall, I personally love Elite Dangerous, but many people find that it is boring or much too difficult or unfinished. And I think these claims are justified. I would say that it takes a certain type of person to enjoy Elite, particularly in its current state. If you are the type of person who is able to self motivate yourself to participate in the galaxy as if  you were actually living in it  then I absolutely must recommend this game. If you are the type of person  who wants a game for casual fun , then I don't recommend buying the full game, perhaps just buy Arena instead.",

Elite Dangerous is somewhat like a flight simulator that you will find very difficult to control without a controller or a joystick (unless you are exceptionally skilled with a mouse). In the game you will basically spend all of your time flying from station to station, and will reach them either by jumping from one star to another at many thousands of times the speed of light, or flying at several times the speed of light inside of solar systems. You will also jump down to sub-light speeds to dog fight or to land at stations.   The main point of the game is to accumilate as much money as humanely possible so that you can get better ships to accumilate money faster. You are free to get money in a number of ways. You can be a pirate that blows up other ships and takes their stuff until someone bigger and better gets you. You can be a space version of a semi-truck moving stuff from one place to another. And you can be a version of space minecraft where you go and get minerals and take them to other stations to sell them off.   It can get amazingly boring after a while. But Elite Dangerous is also one of those rare games that actually makes my heart pound when that random enemy shows up and tries to blow my ship up. It is also one of those games that lets you wander around wherever your fuel and your tolerance can take you. I've only gone a couple of hundred light years from human controlled areas, but there are those that have literally gone to the center of the galaxy.   I recommend this game to someone that likes to daydream.

Private mode allows you to invite your friends into your own instance and work together without the risk of players spoiling your fun.  Endless hours of fun and grinding, whatever your play style is as long as you dont need your hand held like a typical mmo or RPG you will love this game.",

The player community is amazing. They are extremely helpful. It's one of the things that kept me in it. In-game, the player community can be ridiculous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  However, it has a lot of downsides. Unlike many games, there's nothing to make you care. Some players join up with others in unofficial in-game player factions. Some people just like to be the best. Some people Role Play their own story. I however lack the time and in-game material to engage my own imagination. I also like to believe I'm somewhat sane. The player factions often 'embargo' or block access to stations that are involved in community goals because they're aren't fair? In response to this unfairness, they shoot down any newbie just trying to make a buck. The fix is to play solo, but it lacks the moments when you think, 'Oh hey! A person! Hey person! I haven't seen anyone in ages because this game is so huge!' Also the player factions rip on people who play solo because they don't get to harass people endlessly in the name of.. Justice?  Let me make it clear that even though this game has a longer list of down sides, they don't outweigh how awesome the plus sides are.  The new addition of Horizons expanded the game tremendously. Getting to fly at high speed in canyons on moons is a rush. It has so much potential.  UPDATE: I changed my review. Seems like Frontier just badly worded their community update. Frontier is back to good standing.",

It does have short commings: the grind like progression through ships to find what you like is not for everyone, and the rather difficult ways to gather credits in game to try different ships and load outs to find what you like will turn away many.  This is more a game for someone that wants to pull it up for a couple hours and get a space ship fix due to the lack of direct content ... unfortunatly the grindy nature of it makes that a rather difficult thing to do as most activities to make credits take a LONG time to do.  I play it, I like it, I would suggest it to a few friends but not many until some of the short commings are fixed. ",

Buuuuuuut there's juuuust one thing: Horrible BO.   Not just like put on some deodorant BO, but like July in the car with all the windows rolled up, and they decide to take off their 4 and a half year old sneakers off BO.   Now, some can look past the BO problem, and just be madly in love.   I for one, cannot. I am however giving the game a thumbs up. That's because I (like so many other posters here) are waiting for the day that ED takes a shower, and then...by God on that day, I will fall so in love, and this game will be the end all - be all for me.   It is so awesome, and yet it sucks so bad. I keep on trying to fall in love with it, but then my nostrils burn, and I feel ill.   It could be great. It could be GOTY. But it just isn't.   It is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get the hang of. The once you get the hang of it, you REALLY have to work to make yourself entertained. There are a billion places to go and see, and tons of things to do, but none of it is really that cool.   All of the sick screenshots you see listed above, and are like *mind-blown*, this game looks dope! All those screens are taken with a remote camera. So as you look around and are all like awesome, this game looks so cool, you actually aren't doing anything. Just sitting there. Looking around with the camera. (and even the camera is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to use...)  With the latest update 'Engineers', I was like, please yes! Finally! What I have been hoping for, finally some cool missions, some cool grinding. Let me go out and look for some cool ♥♥♥♥, and then pimp out my Imperial Clipper like XIBIT back in the 90's.   But the BO ♥♥♥♥ed that up as well. Upon logging in and WORKING to figure out wtf was going on, and where to go (because I have 50+ hours in the game, so I am now pretty well versed at figuring out how the game works) I go interdicted by the new and 'improved' AI, and it's ♥♥♥♥ed.   I got nuked, and then got nuked again, and then one more time for good measure. Now I'm no noob in the game, but I got beat down like that dude screaming 'Dont taze me bro'.  This game could be the one I settle down with for a good 10 years (if not the rest of my life) but right now, it just agitates the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. We could be so great, but ED needs to wash off the BO. It's almost like it loves its own BO. That's it in fact.   ED self-actualizes itself via it's own BO. The developers love it. But it stinks.  It is so close, but yet so far.   I want to love it, but I have to lie to myself to do it.   Buy the game, check it out. Maybe the stink will not bother you, in which case, Enjoy my friend, enjoy.  You are a bigger man than I. I cannot get past it. I can see the potential.  I want to be in love, but the stink ruins it.   Instead I leave frustrated, standing in the store, at the deodorant section. Lamenting what could have been. (*AND STILL ONE DAY COULD BECOME.)",

You can play it competently with a mouse and keyboard, (once you find the roll to yaw option anyways) but it'll be a lot cooler if you don't.  Around 30 ships in base game, and quite a bit of variety to the feel of handling these boats. Ship and weapon balancing is pretty solid. What I initially saw as straight forward module upgrading and racing to the biggest ship quickly turned into hours of tinkering with loadouts, and months of collecting ships. The fragile little starter ship is also the most agile in the game (and wicked fun to fool around with in stealth builds), and the biggest of them can be shut down if you out-fly them.   It will get grindy after the first few hundred hours don't land you in your dream ship, but only if you never switch gears. Space truck and get paid to land a lot. Smuggle and keep it interesting. Bounty hunt for small scale engagements, join combat zones for bigger. Mine (I think they plan on making it more fun than shooting rocks eventually?). Go on a deep space exploration expedition, cuz it's flippin big and downright pretty out there. Or grab a fistfull of friends, dump a few hundred tons of biowaste out at a hostile station to jam up sensors, and blast everyone who gets offended.  The end game is people!  The AI will get stale. Don't be scared of griefers, learn to 'brave sir robin.' Join one of the 9 player factions and pug the 'verse, or maybe RP your' ♥♥♥ off. Weirdo. The first dozen or so hours I flew in open mode, every player I came across made me jumpy, then I realized this isn't WoW at all. Over 600 hours atm and only been ganked once. Quite honestly I was asking for it, though. I showed my ♥♥♥ and he called me on it, well played sir. There are some damn decent folks in the black, and by and large all player interaction has been understandable/enjoyable.   A few important notes though, it is a sim. Lots of flying between stations. Lots of landing. Then more flying. More landing.  Space is big and these cats built it to scale, even the big empty bits. Also, always online.  There is s solo play mode, but the economy simulation is server side.  No connection, no game.",

The control scheme (roll then pitch when you lined up) which did not bother me on Commodore Amiga, now makes this totally unplayable for me. Try this game out somewhere if you can, and then decide if it's for you or not.  Actually all that was needed is to change the mouse x-axis from 'roll' to 'yaw', and setting 'A' and 'D' for roll. Although the lateral turning is slow as f**k, and you still have to use roll heavily, this way you can compensate the 'horizontal' movement of your targets, and actually hit them even with fixed weapons.

The feel of the ships is superb once you get used to the controls, it might take a little while to get used to them but they are not as bad as some make out, I'm not a flight sim player or anything but I can fly the planes/heli in arma and battlefield, if you can fly those then you won't struggle with the controls. I play with mouse &amp; keyboard and after a couple of tweaks to the default settings (most notably changing your mouse X axis to yaw and roll to A/D), and a bit of time, it becomes really intuitive.  One of the best things about the game is the amazing audio, it really is sooo atmospheric, with each ship having their own distinct sounds and things like the whoooshing as you come out of warp, really boost immersion. The graphics are also top notch with some jaw dropping views running on a pretty decent game engine which is not too heavy on resources, you certainly don't need a beast of a rig to run this on max.  If you like space games and are happy to play without needing a lot of hand holding or being guided by quests, then I'd say this game is for you. Ignore the 'MMO' tag, it is not at all a MMO in a tradition sense but that is not a bad thing really IMO, you can still team up with friends plus you can set up private groups so it is as if you have a server to yourselves and the solo game plays very well, if that is more your thing.

UPDATE AS OF 22/01/16: After playing this game for longer hoping to find a way to change my review I have decided that in my best interest to change the review to positive. this is because there is much more to do than meets the eye you just have to find it however I am in no way saying this game suddenly has a large amount of depth. the only way I feel i can phrase this game is 'as wide as an ocean but as shallow as a puddle' the game just lacks delibrate story incorporated gameplay and is more just a do what you want from day 1 kind of thing. when the devs make a major update to this game adding more story based things to do and better player to player communication this update will be changed again. the good things i have to point out is fantastic skill based combat, not 'who has the better ship wins'. and the game does have great eyecandy no one can deny that.",

            "review_text": "Updating this reveiw a 2nd time to best describe E:D as it is now. Frontier have actually added more stuff to the game such is the CQC Championships mode. More sites, more missions, and AI's that actually have teeth and can be a huge problem if not set up for them. On this note the game is very well done now.   Graphics have been updated, and most connection problems have been fixed.  This game has always had very good graphics.  I wish steam has another option other then just the two. Really, the only reason I can not recommend this game to others on steam now is because Frontier is advertiseing Elite Dangerous as a MMO which is very far from the truth as they are use 32 player island with P2P(Peer to Peer) connection to host the game. Atmost you will see about 8 to 15 other players at the same time.   Other then that fact this game has came a very long long ways from being very boring to now very exciting depending on what you are doing. If you are ok with only being able to interact with a small group of players at one time instead of the big numbers of players if you are playing any other (MMOs) and have a craving for space then this is you game, till a better one comes along.  Just be forwarned that Frontier will be releasing their DLCs at $60 a pop and this point it looks like they'll be droping one every year or there abouts.  False avertisment about release aside, this is the only decent released space game out, at the moment. Me personally more then likely not buy the expansions till FD allows us to land on actual atmospheric planets. Holy hell did Hello Games drop the huge ball with NMS. They make FD look like saints. Glad I've learned my lesson for FD about backing and pre ordering games these days.   All that aside E:D is absolutely at a acceptable price to buy. Like many others in the past have said, if you are looking for instant action Open Sandbox Space MMO do not bother. E;D is at best a partial space sim with a multiplayer feature. At these prices knowing what I know now I can now recommend this game to others. Not to mention the AI's actually are a challenge to fight.",

(So if you have the attention span of a monkey with a brain hemorrhage, you will not like like this game...) On writing this I have invested 431 hours into Elite, 427 of those hours using my 'elcheapo - ends in an X - HOTAS'.   You will need a HOTAS... playing mouse and keyboard just feels wrong. The game was not designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard, its not that kind of game...   Now, as I said above... you will need to invest time into this game, alot of time... ALOT... to get any sort of real reward out of it. It can take a long time to travel around in Elite (its infinite space ...............................................................................), what did you expect... Its not a gold fish bowl! Finding resources, trading, travelling to sell said resources all take time... but thats just the beauty of the game. Its vast..........  Dying... You will die... alot when you start out, probably just trying to land your ship.   Secondly, the NPC's in this game are not stupid, and they will blast you out of the sky if you are inexperienced in flight sim combat, its that simple... again learning combat skills takes time. NPCS will kill you (this game does not take prisoners)... Other players will kill you... (for fun... for your cargo... for whatever reason), this is a sim... SIMULATOR, simulating space travel, trading, combat, and for that reason you are going to die... and dying in this game can cost alot of credits... Credits which will take time to earn back.  Another very important point to understand... This is not *** (3 letters that spells out a pew pew pew fps game)... if you are looking for ***, this is not it. You can fly around for days in Elite and not come across another player... again its space, its infinite... (you could also just have loaded Solo mode, whch will explain Jimmy No Mates) and if you do come across another player, they will most likely blow your dumb *** up if you mess with them, or they may just be playing pirate and you just look so juicy... On saying that, the community within Elite are for the most part sensible well rounded Space Junkies, who would help if you asked nicely.  This very a relaxing game, it is can also be super nailbiting on the edge of your seat, blast your panties right off your skinny legs combat (Skinny legs cause you play PC games instead of exercising) if you so choose to play that way. I actually play Elite to relax.... I enjoy the mining / trading aspect of this game, more than the combat. It is done for the most part really well... fly to a space station, pick up some commodoties, fly to another station sell them, get interdicted, escape, carry on flying, carry on trading, rinse and repeat... Respec your ship, go mining, get attacked by pirates, lose your panties again, sell your ore... back out you go. Respec again for combat, go find some pirates and give them an ♥♥♥ whooping... Momma didn't raise no ♥♥♥♥♥.   Its a brilliant game for what it offers, its not everybodies cup of tea... but hey I dont drink tea... so.",

Have to say that I prefer starcitizen's flight model, it's more fluid and zippy than this far more sedate model. Nice to see they've added some more ships, hopefully some of those will be more interesting to mooch about in than the stock classics. I'm still not sold on the idea of the dlc and doubt I will be unless there's some confirmation it has anything whatsoever of interest. Driving about on dead rocks in a mobility scooter with a roof doesn't interest me in any way.  Overall, it's a bit tedious regardless of get rich quick schemes to help you skip a chunk of grind. The lack of interesting content makes it all the more resoundingly empty but I like the inclusion of more conflict zones which add a tiny bit of flavour to an otherwise bland bowl of gruel and it still has that deep space atmosphere to tide it over at least somewhat.   I dunno, it's a missed opportunity in loads of ways but, for the moment at least, it's not horrific. In fact, I even quite enjoy it again despite myself.",

Well, yes, but I look back on it and see nothing but grinding while listening to podcasts and Youtube videos. Combat is not interesting when you've realized the easiest way to do it. Trading is literally taking one thing to another location and back. Exploration is literally staring at planets for 30 seconds at a time waiting for your planet scanner to finish scanning.  The people behind Elite: Dangerous expect people to play in a lake 10 miles wide and a foot deep. What do I mean by this? Well, the game is huge, there's plenty to do. The problem is, the things you can do are extremely simple. Traders haul goods back and forth. Fighters blow up ships/steal cargo. Explorers scan planets. There is nothing more to it than the idea itself. Quests barely exist, being nothing more than paying you extra for fighting/trading.   This game isn't finished, the devs have said this.

            "review_text": " Elite: Dangerous  is a difficult title to recommend. On the one hand, it delivers an amazingly immersive and atmospheric experience, truly excelling at pulling players into the game, and making them feel the awe of being in space with fantastic visuals and some of the best audio work I've ever experienced in a game. The ships handle well without being too twitchy - even with mouse and keyboard after a bit of tweaking the controls -, combat is satisfying, and its 'to scale' modeling of our galaxy offers unparalleled scope. All the core components of a great game are present, which is why it's so troubling that the game never really expands beyond those core components.   Every game system in  Elite: Dangerous  is a rushed husk presenting virtually no depth. Its economic market is the best example of this. It is player-influenced, with supply and demand shifting prices as players ferry goods between stations, but affords the players no control whatsoever in it. There is no manufacturing, no creation, no ability to do anything beyond shipping materials from point A to point B in the hopes of turning a profit. Trade goods are never used by the players at all, an unfortunate situation that makes mining not only incredibly ineffective at making money (as it's basically a more difficult form of trading), but also deeply unsatisfying, as the ore you work towards collecting will never go anywhere, only disappearing from the economy as you convert it to credits at your station of choice. This lack of depth extends to the development of basically every other game system, much to the game's detriment.  With the simplicity of these game systems comes a simplicity in objective. Your goal, as a player, is to grind more credits so you can buy a bigger ship (which tend to be strictly better than their less expensive counterparts) to more efficiently grind credits in.  Unfortunately, this is made even worse by the game's horrifically poorly thought out reward structure, in which the missions, which at least have the potential to be mildly interesting, give laughably low rewards. In the time it takes you to complete a single mission, you could typically earn 20-100x's as much by simply sitting at nav-beacon or resource node killing pirates for their bounties. The disparity in reward of mindlessly grinding over doing the game's missions is mind boggling.  To the MMO player, the lack of depth in multiplayer is a massive let-down. There is no real reason to work together beyond the benefit of having another person nearby. Without the ability to impact the economy, players have no goals to collaborate towards. There are no multiplayer ships, and no player organizations to be a part of. What it all boils down to is that  Elite: Dangerous  simply should not have been a multiplayer game. Perhaps as a single-player entrant to the series, its sins would have been less numerous.    Elite: Dangerous  is not a bad game, and even with its faults, it's hard to give it the thumbs down. It's certainly enjoyable in terms of minute-to-minute gameplay, but its current lack of depth and the developer's apparent focus on introducing more shallow features instead of adding depth to existing ones ultimately make the game mostly a good introduction to space sims for the newbies whose lacking features will surely have you looking to  Star Citizen  once the inevitable boredom sets in.   The Key Takeaway:   Elite: Dangerous  is, as others have so often put it, miles wide and an inch deep. Without any real multiplayer features beyond being able to group up (which was added in a patch) and shoot at things, it's better to think of the game as a single-player simulator in a shared universe than a real MMO. That said, it's aesthetically astounding, offers unparalleled immersion, and excels at providing minute to minute entertainment through solid gameplay basics. If you aren't looking for a multiplayer game with a lot of depth, you may be able to look past the game's faults to find a really enjoyable experience.",

Two main types of activities - combat (random encounters/fish in a barrel scenarios) and fetching (A-&gt;B trading/smuggling/mining). There's also exploration, but that is just flying from system to system and pressing a button.  - Paid expansions only come bundled with the base game, so you'd have to pay for the base game every time (DOUBLE DIPPING WARNING) - you can play in the same universe without them though. First paid expansion is as bare bones feature-wise as the base game.  - Great setting with beatiful sound and visuals and enormous, yet unfulfilled potential.   - Roughly 40 hours of enjoyment to be had in the honeymoon phase, mostly due to the above.  - Contrary to the game description, it's not an MMO and never will be. Instancing could be compared to lobby multiplayer, where you will have a lot of trouble getting into the same lobby with your friend(s). Generally in Open Play there's a handful of places where you can meet players and 95% of the time you won't see a soul.   - Shrinking active player base - outside of sale/update spikes it's falling steadily. Now that there is a paid expansion with (some) planet landing, the number of players you might encounter in space will be further affected by the number sitting on planet surfaces, if they're not already in Solo Mode that is (always online single player universe). Out of the estimated ~600k owners on steam less than 1% plays the game regularly.  - The game is not very difficult or complex (it's not a simulator in the proper sense of the word and that's perfectly understandable), flying/shooting is pretty arcade, instead the perceived complexity stems from lack of in game information that you need to find elsewhere (no in game help tooltips/popups for entry level players). It's not hard, it's just very unintuitive.  Trial and error should suffice though, you should be up and running in an hour or so, few hours is enough to breeze through all mission types the game has to offer (some missions are so unintuitive that you might need to read wikis/forums beforehand though).  - Overall, it's a game of great unfulfilled potential, marred by a disastrous pricing model and the lack of proper feature iteration. In short, it's a 1984 game design with 2015 graphics/sound.   Recommendation:    ON SALE ONLY  (around 2017 or 2018)",

            "review_text": "Elite Dangerous is odd.   It sits somewhere between trying to be casual game and trying to be a space sim and as anyone who's ever taken a night bus; it aint no fun squeezed in between to fat guys and anything you try to do is gonna be hampered by one or the other.   So, casual game-wise ED offers a pretty pick-up-and play concept whereby you get a ship and sod off out there into to space without a care in the world. Just start her up, throttle up and go. There is no flight model as such as it's space so aerodynamics are about as relevant as a paragraph about Shakespearean literature would be on a Math test. Missions are the usual fetch, wreck or find something type of deal which reward you with 'credits' to spend on making your ship better at fetching, wrecking or finding things.  After a while you'll earn enough credits to buy a new ship that is slightly better at fetching, wrecking or finding things and you will repeat the same process all over again. I'm not saying this is 'Space Trucking Simulator 3300 - with added lasers', but it is very much LIKE a space trucking simulator with added lasers... But wait!! I hear you cry, what about awesome space combat?  Yes, that is quite fun but it typically falls into two catagories -  1) You get pulled out of supercruise by and NPC.  In this case it's like the typical match up will see them epuipped with the equivalent of a banana while you have a tank. Look slighly menacing and in their general direction and they explode.  2) You get pulled out of supercruise by another player.  In this case you're the one with the banana. Then again, running into anything other than banana weilding NPCs is extremely rare.  So combat is typically either woefully easy or woefully hard and even the in-system 'conflict zones' are terribly balanced as well. Dropping into to a conlfict zone is like dropping into black neighborhood wearing the same sandwich board as John McClane did in Die Hard unles you've got a battleship.  So as a casual game it's not really there bewtween the repetative missions and combat.  As a sim I feel it's possibly worse. Firstly the amount of detail availible to you the pilot about the craft and what's around isn't exactly cutting edge. Consider this - an F15C (a jet from the 1976) has no less than 28 displays on the main dash to help you maintian situational awareness and know exactly what's going on with the plane. The ships in ED which are 1,324 years ahead of our old F15 have about 9 displays and none of them are very precise besides your hull damage percentage. The rest of the info is dispalyed in bars and rings. Which are about as accurate as a drunk blind man with a machine gun trying to shoot at a postage stamp 500metres away. The sensor display has rings which I assume depict range, however, no range markers are given.  Also, in the future, ships don't have autopilot apparently which is a crying shame as for 80% of your game time you will be doing literally nothing apart from staring at your screen for when to drop out of supercruise or hyperspace. Space Trucking Simulator 3300 has a minigame; Empty Space Game the game. I pray to be interdicted just so I have something to do for a couple of minutes. The tradedgy of being killed in ED isn't that you loose anything, it's that you might have to repeat the 14 jumps to that place you were going to deliver some data to and you might have to sit watching your screen blankly for another 30 minutes.   Elite Dangerous, much like using a deep space telescope to spy on your neighbors, just has far too much scope - it's too big, it tries to do too much and a lot of it just ends up being rather dull or simply redundant to most players - like the factions and political topogrpahy of the galaxy. Intersting I'll agree but ultimately it's more time spent doing nothing.  Much like the space in between solar systems the game suffers from a lack of content. Do I recomend it?  If you like eploring space and want a game were you can literally spend 3 hours doing nothing then yes (not sure if that even qualifies it as a 'game' to be honest, lets face it you can can spend 3 hours doing nothing at a bustop, but you wouldn't call that a game). If you're hoping for Star Wars/Start Trek/StarGate levels of sci-fi action then honestly you're just not going to find it here.   Until they improve the content, deicide if it's a sim or a casual game and improve other aspects like ship customisation (you cannot name your ship, and .. wait for it... microtransactions) I can't honestly say I reccomend it unless it's insanly cheap on sale. Absolutely stella concept (gettit?), but sadly it's poorly realised.",

            "review_text": "So what kind of game is Elite Dangerous you wonder? In a word, contradictory.  In a few more words: impressive, dull, beautiful, hollow, detailed and repetitive.  The galaxy is immense in size and scope with millions (billions?) of different stars and planets to explore but travelling across it often takes a very long time and once you've seen a few stars and planets they all more or less look the same.  There is a lot of missions you can sign up for but they are just the same few basic job types (deliver cargo here, kill this person, mine some ore, etc) which don't offer you much engagement or sense of purpose/investment and they pay pathetically little compared to the time invested and the amount of credits you'll need to buy the higher level ships. Worse, they often involve travelling somewhere and hanging around for a contact to show up (well the contact might show up anyway).  Combat can be fun, it certainly looks and sounds fantastic, but has very little variation as there is only a handful of weapons/combat upgrades to equip on your ship. Even the different ship classes (in similar price brackets) don't vary much as they've been 'balanced' against each other for PvP.  Overall, there is a lot of attention to detail through the game (each ship has a unique engine sound, beam lasers leave glowing score across your targets hull, etc) and that will keep any space sim fan entertained for a short while but eventually you realise that you are just grinding and don't have any sense of purpose or goal outside of buying another ship.  So is it worth playing? Absolutely. The first couple of hours in game had incredible atmosphere with the huge attention to detail that has been given to the travel/fuel system, the ships cockpits and sounds/visuals. After that though it becomes a tad tedious and time consuming in a bad way (jumping into a system, flying to a station and docking can take 10+ minutes even if you're only doing it to spend 5 seconds to click the refuel option).  If you can pick this up during a good sale, then you'll probably get your money's worth but I can't recommend it for full price, not when you could pick up the X3 Albion Prelude pack for a lot less, and though not as pretty it is a solid game with a lot more variety and content.  And if the wall of text above looks too daunting or simply too boring to read, here's the translation...  Pros: - Incredibly beautiful graphics - Amazing sounds - Attention to small details often overlooked in other games - Ship insurance (pay a fraction of the total cost to get your ship back if destroyed) - Realism (atmosphere when travelling around is well created....)  Neutral - An immense galaxy to explore (albeit pretty repetitive and shallow) - Customisation (can be fun but very limited options and not always clear exactly what benefit an improved part will give your ship) - Has an array of tutorials for some basic skills to play the game but not totally inclusive of everything you need (after doing all of them I still had to go searching for some controls for the cockpit like changing tabs in the console screens)   Cons: - Realism (….but damn, does it take a very long tedious time to travel around) - Lack of purpose/investment - Quickly becomes a grindfest - No depth. The great visual feast disguises a pretty hollow and basic space trader/shooter    Find this review helpful?  Join  Immortis Gaming  for more reviews, cheap game deals, bundles and giveaways! ",

The missions when they exist (often, boards are empty) barely pay any credits.  Certain missions think asking you to hit the 'jump' button literally over 1,000 times over the space of hours and days is acceptable.  Combine this with the 'Engineers' RNG (literally a slot machine) grind introduced later in the Horizons expansion, and you have to wonder what this company is smoking.  The community is a toxic cesspool convinced that any problem whatsoever you have with the game is your, and only your fault.

That includes hovering in the newbie systems and mindlessly killing everyone (something with which there is no recourse against - even crappy Korean grindfest MMOs have this simple mechanic figured out). Moderators of the primary communities (official forums and subreddit) have staff that either are members of, or advocate for, known griefer groups.  Not recommended, not even on sale.

I has all the core things needed to be one of the best space flight sims ever but it falls short on so many levels but ill do my best to give a fair review.  The Good:   1. The game looks really good, though im not sure how it would look on a system that is just making the min req. My rig is pretty high end.  2. The combat it self is pretty good and is very fun ( for a while ) the controls are easy to get used to but not so dumbed down that it takes away from the game. ( the way the ships in EA Starwars Battlefront are a total joke to pilot )   3. A few options on how you want to advance in game that are different from each other ( more on this in the bad section )   4. The size and scope of the game is pretty nifty ( more on this in the bad section )   5. The weapons are fun to use   6. ummmm the game looks good .....   The Bad  1. Once you have done something one time you have pretty much experenced the most fun that thing will ever be ( example: going out to explore was almost fun, It took a lot of grinding to buy and equip a ship that would be able to do the job well but once I left charted space and flew around a few systems scanning thigns I wanted to smash my face on my desk because it was so boring )   2. what ever you end up doing its going to be a grind to get anything cool, and TBH the best ways to make money are offten the least fun, hauling cargo pays well once you have ship that can hold a huge load of goods but its zero challange ( as a example )   3. The mission system is garbage, offten times you fly places and nothing happens or they lack the info needed to find objs and you end up just flying off to do something else. The pay outs are also so crappy you will never earn any cool ships/gear doing them before you lose intrest in the game  4.Huge lack of varried fights, with only a hand full of weapon systems to pick from a lot of the combat ships feel the same to both fight and pilot. So while at its core the combat was done pretty well once you have killed 60 ships or so, or taken part in a NPC fleet battle mission you have pretty much seen what combat has to offer.   5. zero depth, some of this I have already said but just to not end up pointing out every flaw it just boils down to 'zero depth' nothing is fleshed out at all the game feels stale like they just gave up and said 'well we have all the basics and it looks really good so lets pack up shop and call it a day'  6. Broken promises from the company, So many big claims as the game was in the works and starting to come out only to change things up and go for the cash grab with all this paid DLC crap when the base game still needs so much work. when Horizons was revealed and they were asking for 120$ USD for the season pass I sent the company a email asking what the hell was going on. In the reply the guy told me it was ' A surprise to them as well ' Then they end up offering the entire DLC with base game for less than the price I got the base game for in the frist place. It just rubs me the wrong way how flip floppy the company has been on the way this game is suported and marketed. Its left me with zero faith in anything they have to say.  Final Thoughts Save your money, wait for reviews of Nomans Sky or for Star Citz to come out, this game is 5/10 at best and the compnay that is making it is a 2/10 IMHO  Hope this helps happy trails  ",

The missions are nothing but lame old fedex and kill x missions from a terminal. Grinding for money to get a bigger ship is really all there is to do, and once you got a bigger ship you just grind money for the next bigger ship. This game might appeal to those that like FPS games but otherwise it is far to shallow for anyone expecting deeper gameplay.

I hate games where I cannot save before a hard mission, try, fail and go back. what's the point? diskspace? (it sure was back then, but really?!). nothing against a good hardcore-mode, love those, but for that kind of money, I want a checkbox!  2.) mission-time = real-time? whoever thought of that? I have a life outside of elite, guess most old geezers from the original do. I just failed a mission because it had 4 hours when I logged out yesterday and the time was up today. apparently it keeps running when I'm logged out. no, sorry, I dont go looking for the one pirate ship that I've apparently missed when I need to log and go spend time with my family. epic fail!   3.) unable to act during docking-sequence: they are boring after 100th time and I cant escape them. It feels like watching a movie (short one, over and over), not like playing a game. Besides, docking leaves you on the launchpad. you actually have to tell the bloody game to enter the hangar and open station services (another sequence). Anyone know what else I would do on that pad? why is that even a button?!   4.) the game is nice, when I actually get ot play it. 90% of the time I seem to spend in supercruise, managing my speed so I dont overshoot or take hours to arrive. and the time it takes to boot menues in the station like the trade-screen? that was actually quicker on a 286-processor with a 40mb harddisk-drive. why is it that I need to wait for everything I want to do in the game? It used to be dogfights, quick supercruises and trade/refit-screens. now it's 4s-wait on engine spinup, long, boring sequences of hyperspace (found those boring after 6-7 episodes of stargate SG-1 back then and I find that I still find them boring now.)  so all in all, Elite Dangerous is a rich and complex but rather uncut gem that's in dire need for someone to eliminate all the boring waits out of it.

Here are the good things it's massive when you fly around you get the immensity of space. The distances are staggering the way they have done the transision from going from 'warp' to sublight is well done. The ship designs are enjoyable and interesting. The systems as they are pretty cool. Landing your ship successfully for the first time is a triump that is an experience I think everyone should have. When you get into a fight it's exiting and fast paced. Knowing when you jump out is an important skill any pilot will need.   This is unfortunately where the enjoyment starts to end. The deisgn is for it to feel like your in the cockpit and they do this well. But once you've enjoyed flying around awhile and delivered your umpteenth delivery of foodpacks. You start to see the thinnest of this game. You really only have two things to do, shoot people to collect bounties, or be a trader and run goods around. What about mining? Well that is so poorly done that almost no one does it. The design for mining is horrible and after you spend two hours trying to collect 10k worth of minerals to find you friend made 400k bounty hunting you'll understand it is pointless. In any case this quickly becomes a bore that leaves you wanting more. on top of this the utterly steep learning curve is going to drive many players away as you really need to commit 10+ hours before you start have really an idea of how to play.   I could of forgiven these short comings with the idea they are going to continue developement, but it it's now they are already pushing paid expansions. Frankly this game isn't finished into something that is fun and emersive. It's shallow and leaves you wanting so much more. Many in time there will be some meat on this but for know unless you really want a space sim and are willing spend many hours on getting the hang of this, it's probably not the game for you.",

            "review_text": "TLDR:  If your a super hardcore space simulation fan then my review is a waste of your time, I'm talking to everyone else that falls into my 'generael gamer bucket.'  Thoughts:  This game is not meant to be played by casual gamers. It's not meant to be played by even what I would consider your middle of the road gamers. It's meant for the hard core space simulation crowd, I can respect that. I've been fan of the X-3 series for years, (well, except for their latest disaster). But come on, hard on purpose? There is just no reason for it.  This game is not meant to jump in and play. It's fundementally designed to discourage this time of game play. Hours must be spent understanding aspects of the game before they can be used. Hours must be spent repeating the same manual boring tasks over and over again. Almost no player engagement. It's like playing a game that isn't really designed to be played. It would be hiliarious if it wasn't so sad.   I get so frustrated by simulation games that fall into the fallacy of thinking they must be difficult. 'It's a space game! It's got to be hard to do simple things because, you know space!'   -The player has to manually dock every time! 'Because space!'  -The player can't find missions at even starting space stations! 'Because space!'  -The player can't jump to hyperframe because he doesn't meet one of five creteria!' 'Because space!' -The player has to time his drop out of FTL or he'll blow past his target and spin around in circles like a moron trying to find it. 'Because space!'   Wait a minute, I have a space craft that can plot a jump route across hundreds of systems and travel faster then light. But it can't drop me out of FTL when I get to the system I want at the right speed and distance? I think you should have let the guy building the navigation program have a couple of extra days so he could add a 'stop here' subroutine. Like adding brakes to a car, it seems like a fundemental function you make sure you have before you roll it out. Otherwise you'd just have your averages joes running stop lights, driving off bridges or running over the family dog. It's a simple jump in my opinion from running over the family dog to flying inverted and backwards into a sun. No brakes, are you serious?!?!  Also, playing with a friend of mind was almost impossible. Most of the time we didn't even show up in the same instances. After a couple of searches we both switched to open game play and still only were in each other's instances a few times. Frustrating and again time wasting.  The game is visually beautiful. Love and detail went into the design of the cockpits, stations and systems. I can see that love and attention to detail. I only wish that kind of attention was put into the game play and the mechanics, it's a game after all it's mean to be fun, to be enjoyed!   What do I think?   Tedious, boring and needlessly complicated. But above all a general waste of time.   If your a super hardcore space simulation this game may be for you. I can see the appeal and I can appreciate what they were trying to go for.  Everyone else? Pass this one up and play Space Engineers or Starmade or something else, ANYTING ELSE. So many great space games that are actually fun to play and engage the player.    ",

Let me explain: DLC to improve the actual game play shouldn't be DLC. DLC is 'extra content' that is just that: extra. Maybe DLC some custom ships, or even better; build your own starport. Yes, thats right, pick your system and get constructing. You manage your markets, you set up missions for stock you need to produce your weapons, ships ecetra... skys the limit on this one.

Here are some pros and cons (in no order):  P+ The design and overall feel to the game is very nice (save for your pilot's body, not a huge fan). The dev nailed the stations, planets, suns, and the ships. I was blown away at the resolution of some planets - which allowed me to see faint craters and valley's on the surfaces.   P+ Decent learning curve makes you appreciate the complexity of ship controls and the immersive universe.  C- The mission system isn't intuitive. I'd read my objective and proceed to random points having no clue on what I'm doing. The mission indicators need some work as well as the steamlining of information.  C- The CONTROLS. Holy Creator. I don't believe there is a single, optimal control scheme; the joystick setup comes the closest, though. You have to decide whether you want lateral thrust or roll, which are two very vital operations you need throughout the game. No you can't have both, not without some weird control scheme. Mouse + Keyboard was a nightmare to use so I settled for an hybrid Xbox controller setup, and even that is still annoying.  P+ The sheer scale of the galaxy is ambitious and makes sure this game will last for years. I spent an hour wandering though thousands, tens of thousands, then millions of star systems in the map. That was cool.  C- Combat is... 'janky'. That's the best word that comes to mind. I dueled an opponent for a full 15 minutes, barely scratching him and him barely scratching me. Suddenly, another ship appears and kills him within 3 laser pulses... Why? I don't know why. There's no lock on or aim assist either.  C- Lag. The game lags hard while 'frame-shifting' through any given solar system with more than 15 players, and this has nothing to do with my hardware.   +/- Tutorials are worthless. Prepare to learn the hard way   It 'feels' like Elite Dangerous is going for an EVE online setup, eventually, without all the fantasy and way more immersion. Don't say it isn't at least an inspiration, which isn't a bad thing at all.  I really like Elite Dangerous, and the concept, but it just feels empty and unfinished. I won't be coming back to this for a while until there's a major content update.   6/10, above average. Worth your time if you enjoy space games in general.",

If the answer is no, you will want to avoid buying this game. It's a combat flight simulation (IN SPACE!!) at its core, and frankly it's just not that enjoyable without a joystick in my opinion.... who knows, maybe I'm a purest.  At any rate, that has nothing to do with this review, more of an FYI as I haven't seen too many reviews point that out. I do have a joystick and I happen to love a good combat flight sim, but for whatever reason, I just cannot fall in love with Elite: Dangerous. I've put about 20+ hours into the game and while that's not sufficient to cover to entire depth of the game, it is more than enough time to acclimate myself with the game play and all the different 'career tracks' you can take throughout it.  What I like.  I have to say, I'm a big fan of the way the ship controls are setup in this game. I obviously customized my contoller to my liking, but the combat flight portion of the game is great. You have to learn how to properly dock at stations, dog fight, fly in and out of faster than light travel, deal with gravitational pull, heat management, etc. I love that in a solar system, you may have to fly for minutes to travese it from one side to the other. Space is big and this game really brings that perpective into the forefront. I love it, frankly I can't say enough good things about traversing the increadibly huge galaxy in the ship. Massive kudos for the realism in this category.  What I hate.  It's a grind. You grind for EVERYTHING.  Want to explore? You'll spend hours charting new systems, discovering new planets, etc. You go to sell all your hard collected cartography data and you may get upwards of $10k - $30k per system, but you spent HOURS on it. Not really a great payout.  Want to trade? Buy some cheap stuff at your current station and sell it high somewhere else, but since you can't carry more than 200 items in the larger ships (and not even 20 in the starter ships), there's no real way to make a lot of money when items are only providing $100 - $300 in profit.  Want to fight? Spend an hour tracking down bounties, maybe get into 1 - 3 dogfights an hour, and claim maybe $30k - $100k per hour.   Want to do some missions? Any mission that is not illicit in nature isn't worth the time spent on it. Pick the wrong mission and you find that it's a multi-part mission (which you weren't aware of) that requires special equipment or maybe even a DLC you don't own. I literally spent 45 minutes playing a mission I was unable to complete because I don't own the Horizons DLC. Why is that even available?!?  $100k an hour; that's not too bad you say. This sounds like good money until you realize ships are expensive, outfitting them even more so to an egregious degre. It's an ever constant cycle. You buy a bigger ship, you grind some more to outfit it properly. What next? Grind for more money and a bigger ship. Grind it out more for better equipment. Rinse and repeat. At some point I'm told you affect the galaxy, align yourself with factions, etc, but you're going to spend hundreds of hours just getting a ship you like assembled before you even dive into this stuff.  There's no payout without putting in a significant amount of time; no real sense of accomplishment as you progress because you end up doing the exact same thing over and over and over and over.  Maybe this is fun for some people, but to me it's just monotony. I loved flying, I loved exploring, I hated the grind to make any progression. Maybe I'll come back after some more DLC is released with diferent content, but for now I can't say it was money well spent.",

        {
            "review_text": "If you haven't bought the game, I'll fill you in on why I've given it a thumbs down even after playing it for hundreds of hours.  1. When you start off the game, there is no explanation about what you are to do. You don't uncover this. There is no mission briefing. You don't customize your ship and then join some alliance battle against the evil tyrinoids. You are just able to go to a bulletin board and are presented with the following options...   A. Take these items to this starbase/planet base. I'll give you some money.  B. Take this secret message to this starbase/planet base. Don't get scanned. I'll give you some money.  C. Go kill this guy in this sector. I'll give you some money.  D. Go find me an item. I'll give you some money.  E. (Rarely) Go destroy something for me.  Choose an option and off you go. The game's physics are good, and the game engine is decent. You have a lot of variety in the way you can control your ship. Move vertical as well as horizontal, employ yaw, and zoom forward and backward. It's like most any space flight sim, except (And this is important) that here you will turn incredibly slow. 'But hey man, this is space, shouldn't you be able to fire your thrusters and quickly spin on your axis to point the opposite direction?' Nope. Not here... By DESIGN you turn really slow. You CAN rotate and then pitch up or down to speed it up slightly, but it's still very slow and annoying; especially in combat. We might as well be flying bi-planes in WWI, because that's the flight model. Even when you have flight-assist turned off, your ship still slows down after you use boost. Why? While you can do a bunch of fancy things, like use your vertical rockets, yaw/pitch, and turbo boost to move things along, it's all purposely cumbersome to make up for the developer's inability to construct a combat system that would be (A) Fun (B) In Space.  2. When you decide on where you want to go (Via a couple decent vector maps that are easy to understand and use), and you leave the starbase you are at, you will point your ship at a dot in space, maximum thrust, and when you leave mass lock (Usually ten seconds) you can then engage your frameshift (warp) drive.  Unfortunately, you do not just warp to the system you are pointed at. Instead, you have to jump to each star-system along the way. For instance, to take the 2 boxes of tea to the starbase in Rygel 3, you'll need to make 8 jumps.  Each time you stop at a jump, inexplicably you appear on a direct course towards a star. So if you don't immediately steer out of the way, you'll crash out of warp, and start cooking. Every single time. EVERY TIME. Eight jumps, eight stars you have to steer away from. Zzz...  So, each time you are in a system, you have to fly away from the star so you don't overheat, and then can warm up your frameshift drive for another jump. This whole exercise takes about 30 seconds. Eight stops + 30 seconds. 4 minutes. Remember that... We're at 4 minutes.  Now, each time you reach a star, one of two events take place.   1. Someone will radio you a message that says, 'Finally, I found you, follow me, I have important information for you.'  2. Someone will radio you a message that says, 'There you are, I've been waiting for you, all that tasty cargo.'  Apparently pirates in space are waiting around to rob you of two boxes of tea. These messages are not varied much, and happen all the time. Every star you run across, you get one or the other, or both, or (If you've accepted a lot of missions) a whole bunch of them that say the same thing from different people.  If you follow the first guy, he basically exits warp, and invites you to stop and talk to him. You fly for about 5 minutes to his location. (9 minutes total now) When you get to him, he just tells you that he'll give you some cash to take the Tea to a different station. Why did he ask you to follow him? He could have just sent you the message when he sent you the greeting. Dumb. So you wasted five minutes. You then blow another 30 seconds engaging the frameshift drive. 9.5 minutes.  Now, at the second planet, you get to play the Interdiction game. Effectively, a tunnel has formed in front of you. It is moving all over the screen, and your job is to follow it with your reticle, so that it times out, and you escape. Otherwise, you can power down, or be forced, and enter space with a pirate who wants you to dump your cargo or die.  In most situations, either your frame shift drive will be cooling down for a few minutes while this guy attacks you with everything he has, or you'll be mass interrupted, which slows your frame shift drive warmup down. So you fight.  3. Combat... This is pretty much what you'd expect. You have beam weapons, missiles, frag cannons, mines, and a host of counter measures. Imagine playing a First Person Shooter. Imagine if the enemy was always behind you, shooting you in the back, but instead of being able to turn around and shoot back, you turn so slowly that the enemy is easily able to run behind you and shoot you in the back more. So only after doing a few cartwheels, and a barrelroll can you get the guy in your sites to fire at him a couple times before he's behind you again. Eventually it breaks down into whoever has the best countermeasures and shields, and has less to do with any kind of flight skill. If you are underpowered in your armaments (Which is the case early on) you'll run into guys you can't even penetrate their shields. And they'll destroy you. So you'll start back at the last starbase you were at, and likely go into debt paying for your new ship.  Combat can last a long time because it takes forever to line up your enemy. Figure ten to twenty minutes per fight unless you get blown apart early on or the enemy is really weak. Let's say 5.5 minutes average. You've now blown 15 minutes of your life, to start the game over.  Also, ammunition costs money. Let's say you defeat the enemy and you earn $18,000 for the kill bounty. (Not every kill gives you a reward.) Each torpedo in your torpedo launcher (Which can carry an amazing 2 torpedos in ammo total) is $15,000. So to restock two of them, the maximum you can carry. $30,000. Great... Also, some weapons are totally worthless. I won't get into that.  4. You arrive at the sector where your starbase is. It's a dot on the map. You might fly to it in about 3-5 minutes. But there are plenty of starbases far away, that you'll point your frameshift drive at it, and fly in a straight line for 20 minutes to 1.5 hours. That's right. You can watch an entire 90 minute movie before you get there. Fun!  5. You finally dock, and they give you some cash. Your selection of new missions can be found above in section 1. Same missions. You will repeat the above over and over again. Over and over and over again...  6. Horizons gives you a rover that you can drive around on a planet surface. There is nothing there. Literally. But you can drive around. Sometimes you can pick up rocks that you can't sell, but you can waste even more time turning them into something to give you a small edge in combat once. There is supposed to be more stuff coming out, I guess.  So you might ask, why then did you play this game so much? I fell for all the praise this game has gotten, over finding black-holes (Boring black space in front of you, not even the lens effect going on), landing at star bases with their own factions and events (Same five models used over and over again.) and combat being great. It's not.   It's just not fun. It could be. But right now, it isn't.",

Over time you accumulate money by various increasingly repetitive tasks and upgrade ships and systems, then you repeat the process. You spend a lot of time transiting rather than doing things. It is a sandbox game in that the galaxy goes on without you, but most of the rules of the galaxy (at this time) don't make sense - your ship is insured, so you get 95% of the value back if it is destroyed, but you don't pay any premiums and there is no penalty for increasing the risks you face. The political side 'powerplay' verges on incomprehensible, there are 3 major factions and you can be a reserve naval officer in all of them simultaneously (think being a naval officer in the USN, Russian Navy and Chinese Navy at the same time).  The game has 3 modes, open, solo and a co-op mode - all 3 modes effect the larger game universe, leaving the absurd situation where you can play in Solo mode to undermine a faction and no member of that faction can take any action to prevent you, because you are in a seperate universe.  When upgrading components of your ship, few numbers are presented, just rough aproximations by red and blue bars. Voice comms within the game doesn't work well, changing the paintjob on your ship is a DLC purchase (per paint job). It doesn't support AMD crossfire setups and must be connected to the net to play, even solo mode.  I have put in about 175hrs and have reached the point where I don't see the point of grinding away to buy the next ship. The game has potential and, with the planned expansions may meet it, but you can't count on that.

Sure it has a whole galaxy you can travel around, but what can you do in it? You can trade, which is fairly uninspiring. You can do missions, which are very uninspiring, and not nearly as lucrative as killing wanted people, which is also one of the few fun things to do outside of exploring, which is also seemingly unfinished.  There is a very small amount of variation of ships, stations, weapons and activities. Perhaps future updates will see to this, but as it is right now, I'd say it's a very functional early access game, with much too little content.  Also, the stations have way too few docks, seemingly, so if you're not playing solo mode, prepare to wait, for ages.  Also, I'm not sure the rotation speeds of the crafts make sense, rotating anything in space is very easy, yet here it's one of the slowest things you can do. All it does is make the battles slower, which kind of makes sense, but it's fairly boring.  So maybe in the future this could be a good game, but from what I've head, it's mostly paid DLC, which, considering the cost for just the base game and its lack of features is unacceptable.",

I bought my ship back for 1.2 Mil and then went to the map to plot my course again. I undocked from the station and apparently when you rebuy your ship all your systems are turned back on because I was over my power limit since i swap between auto dock computer and a shield booster.

But this time they were both on right when I left the station so my ship shut down and I was pad loitering again instantly and couldn't get my systems online fast enough so I tried exiting the game and it made me wait 15 seconds!!!!!! I shut down my computer and somehow my ship was away from the dock when I started the game again but come on! that is so stupid.

In which you'll be left gaging- your going to start out loving it- it's the space sim you've always wanted. graphics are good, controls intimate- Combat exhilarating. (VR is crazy!) It even creates a great open world MMO experience where if your like me and you really just want to be left alone in the game you can be. Or you can link up with others. Then before long your going to be hungry for credits because the starting sidewinder is... well, a starter ship no surprises there. Welcome to the grind- you'll spend the rest of the game hunting credits to basically get into another ship with it's own trade offs. You'll buy it and realize, hey!? This doesn't expand game play at all.  (To be fair they do balance the ships fairly well.)  The game's forum community doesn't really want to hear it either, basically if you pipe up on any of the games obvious flaws you'll get squashed- either by a player that claims apart from icey planets needing to spit polished a little more, you just have to enjoy the game for what it is. Or a vet player who will concede the games only flaw, is that the new Cobra ship is nowhere near what it used to be in the previous series titles. *yawn*   Exploration gets old fast (simply fly scan, fly scan.) Combat is great, Trading is fun- but to be successful you will need to capitalize on a decent route which change. Oh yeah and the cut throat nature of it all. At fist it's great, you make an error and yep the unforgiving void crushes you completely at first you appreciate it, but then after a year or so of unforgiving punishment you start to just plain resent it.  So, you'll get burned out, swear off the game for a period of time- till you forgive it and come back and become part of the player samsara of burn out &amp; replay.  Here it is on the level. I love the game, despite it's frustrations and fly around scheme that's as empty as space time sink can get. Currently I'm burned out beyond belief and yeah I'll come back to it later. Largely because there just isn't another space sim out there that does space-sim this good. However, I can't/won't recommend the game. Largely because of it's insane cut-throat-ness, slow progression, &amp; minimal reward for time spent.   It's not a game for everyone- Chances are you'll get sucked up into 3 categories of player. The one that hates it- and swears it off for good. The one that believes elite can do no wrong- and will run to defend the title against any criticism thrown it's way, the cyclical player- the gluttons for punishment, the players that like BDSM, just not enough to have their own dungeon in the basement.   Hope this helps you decide on if to buy it or not- I didn't really discuss any of the new content added by the devs. here which does help with some of the monotony but not enough to change my recommendation.

The Bad:  - Steep learning curve. Surmountable, but still steep. - Repetition. The missions are repetitive, once you get past the learning curve it's striclty a grind, even combat and bounty hunting. - The missions are given in text format. Seriously. Text Format. In 2015. Not one bit of video or voice acting. Unacceptable. - No depth to the game. There is a background story, but it'sa bunch of 'news updates' text nonsesne that doesn't affect you one bit and after the first week you stop bothering to read them. - Power Play is a grind. It was added as a way to take part in the struggle between empires, but it's an even more boring grind than the regular misisons. - Not enough different weapons effects/ublanaced weapons. After a few hours of playing you quickly figure out that only a few of the limited selection of weapons are of any real value. Missiles, for example have very limited ammo and do squat against shields while being unimpressive against exposed hulls. - You can't land on planets. Promised in a future DLC - which you have to pay for. Very sad to see another dev release an unfinished game and then offer paid for expansion packs to get the full game experience. - Did I mention the repetition of missions? I honestly had fun for the first 100 hours learning the game. After that it was grind, grind grind.  This game has GREAT potential. But right now it feels hollow. Completely lacking in immersion. Wait maybe a year or so and if the dev lives up to their promises you'll have something worth sinking your time and money into.",

Lots of bugs in horizon from getting trapped on landing pads the game doesn't release you from then threatens to blow you up if you don't leave the pad. Falling through the ground. Very slow progression without much point.  Bit more info: Some good things about this but once you get to mid-ranks, the game is badly designed in the worst of ways. I moved up to a Type-7 transporter finally, and the game became moot, solely due the AI mechanics.   The moment I have ANY cargo I get chased and interdicted, over and over and over and over. I wasn't wanted, I wasn't smuggling, I was friendly/allied with the factions of the system I was flying in, etc.   But I'd be endlessly interdicted, have to basically fly into planets for a force failure, at which the enemy would do the same and be fine, I'd run away - as there isn't any other choice in freighters - and then just have to deal with it until enough flying around let me through. Sometimes just giving up and walking away from the machine for a while because it was so ridiculous.  This last time before uninstall, I was up to being interdicted 9 times in a row, no exaggeration, with only a couple seconds between escaping and then getting interdicted again. the first 8 were an imperial eagle. I was overheating massively because, despite having A-rated components, it simply couldn't endure that. Overheating meaning you're taking damage just from the heat, not to mention whatever the enemy throws at you. The game, I guess, got tired of it, and finally threw a highly combat ranked clipper at me, with clearly amazing equipment, that just blew me to complete bits in under 30 seconds.  That's a loss of 2 million because of a cheating game, when I was barely making 100k per mission, and even 300k every 15 minutes with straight trading.  The balance between ships across the board is completely off, specialized ships gets decimated, jack-of-all-trades ships are masters of everything.  Funny thing is that I quit this game a long time ago for roughly the same reasons...and it's still here but much worse.

The 'major' update that occurred in the past month or two was the addition of PowerPlay which is a micromanaging type mechanic that just adds more grinding into the game. At the current moment there is no real endgame goal to strive for and as I already stated since there is no easy/sane way to make your own content you simply just drift along and hope for player interactions. There is an update coming by the end of the year that will add team deathmatch combat in instanced areas. This might help the game out but most of us want the living breathing universe part of the game to be worked on.

It's confusing because they don't really tell you how should you be completing your mission. They just tell you where and off you go. It's brutal for new players. It's boring because once you figured out the formula how to completed those missions (after googling/checking reddit) all missions are the same. Even all NPC say pretty much the same script. It's boring-as-♥♥♥♥. There is no galaxy-at-war, no epic quest line, no heroic escape, no solving mysteries, no strange and exotic aliens. Nothing.  Trading is also not well done in this game. The ingame tools are confusing to use, not informative, sometimes downright incorrect. Any trader worth his/her salt will not use the ingame tool to find trade routes. That's how bad it is. Trading also is treated as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of professions. Every new patchs the trade routes are either eliminate or nerfed in the name of 'Background Simulation', but the so-called simulation always nerf your routes, never boost them.   You also get zero benefit to do trading in Open Play (open PvP) except you can roleplay as a poor helpless trader and get killed over and over again by other player pirates. Why would anyone do that is beyond me.  While a lot of features are not well done in ED, the sound engine is top-notch. Most ships have great engine sounds. The graphic is also pretty nice and run well on general PCs. I especially recommended ED if you have an Oculus Rift.

If you don't mind spending 3-5 minutes every time you dock your ship (yes there is no automated docking, at least for the initial ship), and 10 minutes everytime you drop into a star system to find a space station, then go for it. Jumps to stars only 30 light years away (and some even closer), would take unexpectedly long paths, with up to 30 individual jumps needing to be made - each of which takes a couple of minutes in real time, assuming you don't need to harvest fuel from a star. The controls are complicated, and there is very little intstruction in the tutorials on performing basic actions in the game (such as getting new quests, outfitting your ship, 'scooping' up fuel from stars), basically you have to do tons of research outside of the game on internet forums and Youtube to figure out how to do basic things in the game.  Some pluses for the game - it is very pretty, especially when you see stereotypically Sci-fi scenes, such as space stations hanging above alien red planets, or when jumping into a new system for the first time, coming to a hault in close to a star. The galaxy map is cool. Just getting lost in exploring a star system can be fun, if you don't realize you aren't getting anything 'done' in the game (the credits that you get for finding new astronomical objects, seem to be inconsistently delivered - I couldn't even trade in the data I happened to capture - it was marked red with no explanation about why it couldn't be sold).  If you like complicated flight simulators, trading systems in a Sci-fi setting, and spending hours outside of a game just to understand the basic functions, this will probably be up your alley.",

There is a demo linked on Reddit that will give you a pretty good idea about what you are getting into with E:D.  The entire control scheme is included in that demo and is a pretty good thing to wrap your head around along with some scenario missions, at least before dropping $59.00.  Also, if you insist to purchase with hopes of a refund consider the fact that it could easily take two hours just to understand and set up the controls. Don't forget to close the launcher. When open it counts against your gameplay time.  I own the base game now and here is where I currently stand in consideration of the new DLC.  I'll be waiting, watching and reading reviews all the while holding my cash until the time is right.  Could it possibly take years?  Maybe but also it is possible that something better will come along and replace Elite altogether.   You are going to get about a month of good gaming, if you enjoy this kind of game, with the base game.  Keep in mind, I said, if you enjoy this kind of game. It is quite fun for awhile but it is a grind and it is very limited in what you can do.   You may want to hunt down that demo and give it a go because there really isn't much more to it than that, which is basically learning to fly. If you enjoy that demo and find yourself wanting more, then I would say that E:D is a good fit for you. If you don't then keep your money because you won't appreciate anything else it has to offer.

Frontier believes that this is an independent project and that they have no obligation to satisfy player requests/demands. They continually add AI adjustments and mechanic changes which nobody really asks for, and ignore any lashback/complaints that happen as a result.   There are still a few bugs in the game that have been in since launch, and every update sees more added to the list. Frontier spends very little time and effort ensuring that the game works smoothly or that their players are still on the same page.  I LOVED Elite Dangerous when I first started, greatly. I don't spend over 100 or 200 hours on a game unless I find it fascinating. But at this stage, I wish I had those hours, and the money I spent on the game and it's DLC back.

It has one of the best HUD/UI I have ever seen in a game... If you are skilled and learn how to use your starter ship you can grind fairly quickly to get a bigger ship. But the grinding is all the same... The combat is all the same, the interpersonal relations, as far as I have seen, are basically non-existent. And after spending $50 or more.... you have to pay for the expansions. Are you kidding me? That's straight up greed. If you have money to fork over in what is going to be basically a flight simulator, buy this game. If you are looking for good PvP and fun events where the community gets involved with each other.. don't spend the money. The concept here is wonderful, I give them all the credit where it is due... but I feel there are major changes that should be made in not only how the expansions are distributed, but also in the way that combat zones, item drop zones ( mysterious signals, weak signals, etc.. ) are handled, there should be more variation in my opinion. I repeat aesthetically and mechanically this game is a 10, but it is the balancing of theses zones and the distribution of zones and there rewards as well as the new expansions, that I make it so I don't want to play again.",

Second &amp; perhaps the worst: patience. In a galaxy as huge as 1:1 scale travelling fast from A to B is what is required but the game penalises those people making fast velocities an issue &amp; not a solution. Missions include waiting for an unspecified time for contacts to 'arrive' (sometimes lasting an hour) before being given a mission update to go elsewhere &amp; getting jack all at the end.

Of course, I already really knew that lesson going into this, but sometimes I have to get my head beaten in over and over to really let things sink in =)  If you appreciate all the intricacies of flight sims and enjoy taking those concepts into the space sim arena, you'll greatly appreciate the depth that this flight engine has to offer. Novices can get by just fine with rudimentary skills, but pros can hone their talents to squeeze every last ounce of usefulness from each maneuver. You'll feel right at home with a TrackIR, Saitek X52 Pro and Combat Pedals. This game was literally made to use these things effectively, and it does.  But eventually, you learn that all that extra gear and work doesn't make much difference when you're outgunned by Anacondas and such, employed by people who grind this game with bots because nobody in their right mind would dedicate all those hours of grinding to earn such a beastly ship, especially when the draconian penalties in this game allow for you to lose all those hundreds of hours of work instantly just because you couldn't afford the damn insurance on that ship you had been saving up for. I very much fear that my dream of enjoying Star Citizen may end up similar to this story, as I've noticed a disturbing amount of similarities being advertised there. Let's hope I'm wrong about that.  Anyway, this is basically why this game cannot be fun. Nobody wants to pay to play what amounts to a second job. I mean, I guess I did for a little while, but really.... it got old. I kept telling myself it would be worth it... 'Grind up and get those big ships.' 'Get that next weapon or ship component, and it'll change everything.' ...It won't. It didn't.   This game amounts to a great vision and dream, but overall a very poorly executed one bringing no compelling reason to play it at all. Sometimes too much sandbox is... well... too much. There's no story whatsoever, no skill progression, no character development, and it's hard to give a crap about galactic politics when it's all just the same exact content painted with a different veneer for each faction. It's like looking at a perfectly balanced equation and somehow being told that it's a good idea to jump in there and try to change the balance. You won't, because you don't matter enough. You never will when the game consistently tells you that 'you're not special'... 'you can't make a difference'. It never veers from that advertisement.  On the other hand, if you're a masochistic die hard, then jump right in and have a blast. You'll be right at home in no time; pounding sand all day long.",

That being said there's enough to make neurotic players like myself who enjoy grindy video games entertained for a while.  I'm still waiting for my god-tier space sim to come along and I've not found it. X3 is one of my favorites but it doesn't have the size I want. Elite dangerous has the size I want but it doesn't have anything else. Eve is far too rediculous with real time levelling where you have to pay the company for a year before your character can do anything you want to do - you can't set a goal and work for it - you set a goal and pay the company until you reach it a year later (and literally everyone in the game is a total jerk - you'll find a much nicer group of internet trolls on four-chan).  After a solid 1.4 million in sales these people really should have been able to afford hiring a few new code monkeys and add all that stuff they KNOW a game that looks this good and is this big deserves.",

            "review_text": "I must congratulate E:D on being a game that claims to be a 4x-game AND a triple A title and fall so horribly short on those promises.  Now you must understand I'm a big X player so I'm used to steep learning curves but this game took that to a whole new level. After jumping in and horribly failing I took a look at the available tutorials only to be disappointed right there. Youtube video's are cool but they tend to fall short on actually giving new players the starter experience they so desperately need. However I wasn't discouraged (yet) so I took a look at the tutorial missions.....which started out with combat....not basic flight, not docking, HUD-control, Key-control, Basic gameplay, no we jump straight to combat....where they don't really explain anything. The combat tutorial says: Destroy all cannisters and that's about it. Considdering I had already played for a bit I at least knew how to deploy my hardpoint and target stuff so I managed to destroy said cannisters but by then was scratching my head on how much of a tutorial this really was....I would've called it target practice and this generally set the pace for the entire game; you learn by trial and error and mostly through the latter causing instances where you (as the new player) make a tiny mistake that ends up forcing you to self-destruct because you simply have no other option.  Right now I managed to jump TO a sector to deliver some cargo only to discover I can't get BACK anyway whatsoever....so I managed to get there with a FULL load only to be unable to return EMPTY.  It took me a google to discover that setting your throttle into the blue area of your speedometer actually allows you to NOT overshoot your target 80% of the time (yeah because in some instances even THAT won't avoid you horribly overshooting your target)....or being forced out of hyperdrive and straight into a sun. My first combat mission pitted me against a enemy that was horribly beyond the capabilities of my own ship. Trading missions often neglect to tell you you can't actually complete them but DO fine you afterwards for failing and by god remember to pay that fine because the punishment is always the same: a deathsentence.  So starting players are basically forced to start off earning measily profits by playing deliveryboy and take good X to station Y; rinse and repeat.  If that hasn't discouraged you yet then by all means read on.  Pros: *The game and audio look and sound gorgeous  Cons: *The game is a confusing mess for new players with little to no help other than Google *Stuff that's supposed to help you only do so in CERTAIN conditions *Have google handy; you'll need it to actually make a profit (better than those 500 creds you can make by smart thinking) as well as to get info on just about everything else in the game *ABHORRENT Route-plotting (plot a course only to find out AFTERWARDS you can't actually reach your target) *HORRIBLE Interface controls (have fun steering your ship while your interface panles are active. My tip; open a panel and then for the love of all that is holy don't even slightly touch your mouse) *On the previous point; remap your keybindings....about 80% of them....or buy a joystick (preferably one with a throttle stick) *Be ready to do EVERYTHING yourself; from flying your ship to its destination, docking, landing, Comming (as in communications) because there's NO autopilot or ANY automation of any form whatsoever. *Extreme Learning curve *Extreme Grinding *Lack of content *NO OFFLINE SOLOPLAY  And for those who play X and are thinking about this game *No station building *No stock trading *No feel you're making an impact by existing *Horrible lack of customisation in comparison *Incredible lack of diversity *Even worse learning curve *Extreme longer grind *Less immersion and little to no story  So this game should be 4x Explore: yeah we have that Expand: almost non-existent Exploit: only once you discover you're better off smuggling than anything else (or bounty hunting once you get rid of your starter ship) Exterminate: Only if you delve into the bountyhunting mission or go conflictzone hunting because you can't really depend on you being interdicted frequently. Oh; or if you're one of those guys who loves trolling newbies who just started but then I would rather call you a griever.  TL;DR: get a copy of X:albion Prelude, it's a better game by far even if it DOESN'T have an online multiplayer mode.",

You feel like nothing but a driver going through a check list of chores, like actual real world truck drivers who are paid to do that. It can be interesting because of the beautiful graphics, sound design, and the fantasy of mundane work in a slick futuristic enviornment with space ships, exploring the galaxy, but after you're done living that fantasy you realize Elite: Dangerous has the depth of a puddle and there is no reason to keep playing. I would say there is potential for more interesting content because the core gameplay and aesthetics are so good but after Horizons released the developers revealed themselves as lazy and greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and this will likely never be the case.   The graphic design for the interfaces, the ship cockpits, the designs for ships overall, the incredible graphical fidelity especially for an idie game, and the sound, are all top notch. You really feel immersed in the galaxy. But it's just so dull and shallow after you get a few higher tier ships. I recently played another game like this, X Rebirth, and that game is a better example of how to do this sort of thing but have more content and goals for the player to achieve and not come off as shallow and boring while still being primarily about space trucking.   I would definetly reccomend Elite: Dangerous for it's $15 sale price but ♥♥♥♥ Horizons and buying it for anywhere close to full price. I can't deny my initial ten hours of entertainment so maybe for that it's worth experiencing at a sale price but the game overall is just not good and past those first ten hours you will start to see that and regret your purchase like I do after I bought the game for $60 on launch like a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after hearing all the positive reviews and buying into the game's concept never having played a 'space sim'.  Don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like I was and pay money for this turd. Don't buy into the mindless reviews singing praises when they probably only played for two hours and got the game for free. Don't get so caught up in the great concept and impulse buy, like me. Not only do I regret it because the game is shallow but I hate knowing the Jewish developers now have my sixty shekels and will use it to milk their small but dedicated fan base for another yearly DLC that adds nothing and asks the price of a full game.",

If you add content to a 'game in construction' dont charge those loyal enough to stick by your side extra, remember it was us who basically invested in a concept to allow you to develop updates.   For those who are considering buying this just remember its a VERY VERY long process to do anything in this game. If you want to travel be expecting at least 1-2 hours of your time, same goes with trading basically you buy something cheap from one station then sell to another station for more. Fun concept EXCEPT its about 20-30min of actual navigating in a space simulator. If you even dream of new upgrades and a new ship be expected to do this over and over and over again... it gets repeditive and boring.

Let's not start that argument here, please.) And, from what I have seen of the expansion, it has a lot of potential but currently it really isn't worth the money. And I'm starting to feel like Frontier is ignoring everyone in the community who hasn't bought the expansion, which can only lead to problems in the future.

There is nothing more I want than to get rid of this absolute piece of ♥♥♥♥ game!   ONLY buy this game if you are a flight simulation fanatic and have top of the line gaming equipment. Anything else and you will fail miserably. Regarless of how much you fine-tune it, playing this with a standard mouse and keyboard is impossible. The aiming takes god-like accuracy. Plus, the ways the enemies move in space...come on! No physics engine I know can make a larger craft move with such speed as to permanetely stay in the back of a light fighter.   In terms of gaming usability, this game is an absolute nightmare. Nothing, and I mean nothing other than press fire to shoot is intuitive. It is worlds away from the original game in this standpoint. The tutorials....I have no idea why they included those tutorials, they are useless. One example: when docking, you need to be aligned with the docking tower. That information is not presented...ever (not in the manual, not in the youtube tutorials, and certainly not in the in-game tutorials).  Later edit.   Tried to play some more and do some fetch the stick missions (aka: retrieve artifact for study OR learning from tragedy). Guess what! Those are even less user friendly than the in-game tutorials (yes, it came as a shock to me too). Do you have any idea where to go in the system to do those or to pick crap up? No? Me either and apparently, neither does my good friend Google. There is virtually NO information out there on how do these jobs. You see some checkpoints nav beacons. Being a normal and sane person you'd expect one of those would be it, right? He he he, apparently the game designers decided that's a stupid way to do things. So....no, I still don't know how to do those missions.   To add to the fun, sometimes you have to travel 53322 ls to your destination. Yes, those are 10 minutes of your life you are not getting back...because what else am I going to do with my time than watch stars flying around my screen. Seriously, I am all for atmospheric, but this is ridiculous.   Real time missions? Real time missions! As in when the mission says you have 30 minutes to do the mission you have IRL 30 minutes.

Elite was released in a very obvious early state, lacking content and polish, cumbersome GUI, and a good majority of the mechanics in this game either currently don't work as stated or don't work at all, it doesn't take long to realise that whilst a near infinite amount of procedural generated systems sounds good in theory but you'll soon be aware your seeing the same old objects in different places with different names and without some good old hand crafted polish not an awful lot makes one civilised lifeless system stand out from the next the galaxy is too big and too empty which may be realistic but doesn't work well for game play and eventually you'll find a good cluster of systems that facilitates every type of career path where you can settle at an unofficial home port and you'll have no desire to explore the other 99.99% of the galaxy you are yet to see.  6 months on from release and still not an awful lot has been done to address the major issues instead of focusing on improving the core game it has been rushed unto Xbox One which will no doubt divide their dev resources even further trying support the various platforms this game is now playable on. With each update comes a new host of painfully obvious crippling bugs that shouldn't make it through QA and some of the design decisions lead me to question whether the Dev team have spent time play testing their own game for a length of time outside of their own Dev build. The latest update was promised to be the biggest content update so far but it only seems to have added in more grinds on top of your old grinds because we heard yo like grinds with no major changes to the core game play added which means this huge patch brought nothing to the table for the people that have no interest in participating with Power Play which is an easy thing to do as it doesn't offer much financial reward for the risk involved unless your willing grind your way up to the highest reward levels which then requires you to keep grinding to stay in the higher reward bracket.  Don't get me wrong though it's not all dull and boring, the remaining 10% of my time was spent in complete awe as the first 20 or so hours of game-play or the 'Honeymoon period' is pure bliss, amazing sound design, visuals, flight model, the most appealing things about the game are the flight model and being close to the surface of the planets which both are very under utilised as you spend the majority of your time in super cruise and any such battles never usually take place near the surface of a planet so you dont get that scale and beauty of the planets which some are truly breathtaking some good progression has been made with the AI in the last patch (1.3) considerably improving AI combat which has made PvE combat fun again.   I do enjoy this game when I play it purely for fun regardless of progression, it basically currently boils down to currently that this game has been designed for a very long life span out of the consumer but simply doesn't have the content to back it up, I still play Elite it's only out of passion for the game I have spent so many hours building my assets and writing this review in hopes some one will take note as I really want to see the game blossom to it's full potential in the future but I can't recommend the money/time investment at this stage in development unless your quite tolerate of grinds, if it wasn't for the slow cash generation compared to buying/outfitting/maintaining high end ships where modules can cost more than the ship itself I probably wouldn't have spent as many hours as I did to make a conclusion but I was always motivated by the 'What If's' of owning one of the bigger ships that kept me progressing I just had to own one myself, but honestly it wasn't worth the time investment as whilst yes they do feel bad azz to fly but owning a big ship does not unlock any new aspects of the game that you previously didn't have access to before from the first 10 hours of game play, just makes what you were doing all this time just that bit easier.  If I could leave a mixed review then that would be more fitting to my feeling it's just too unfinished to recommend at its current price, I know this review will eventually be changed from a NO to a YES at some point when Elite's ray's of sunshine will break through the clouds but nobody knows when for certain as the Dev's aren't very open to sharing their own visions or publishing a road map, my own personal estimation is to wait at-least another 12 months for the game to mature further and it may be worth its purchase price.  This review will split the crowd as it's a niche game and many have waited for 20 years for a reboot they will have convinced themselves that this game can do no wrong and overlook poorly implemented mechanics because of the nostalgia of 'Elite'.",

While the expanse of space is big, after the first ten or so solar systems you visit, and after around 2-8 hours of game play, this game becomes a very boring rinse and repeat type game. Sure, you can earn money, buy new ships and advance, but there is very little to diferentiate this game from any other MMO out there except that you're in space. Even EVE is more involved than this, however, at least ED gives us a more single person (even thought you're a ship) dog fighter space cobat sim type of experience, where EVE is more like a real time strategy space MMO. If you're looking for a really hard game to learn that does not give you hours of enjoyment later, then ED is your game. While I would not recommend this game for noobs, if you're really into space games, it might satiate you until a better game comes out like No Man's Sky or Star Citizen.   Bottom line is, Elite Dangerous gives us an arcade game on steriods. After you learn the very difficult controls, the game is very arcade like. I never felt as if I was being drawn into another world.   Now, for full disclosure, I have not purchased Horizons yet and will be doing so to see if it helps with the monotony.

Say you want to go from Dingleberry Station to Bootyblaster XVIII's moon. You have to jump through every, single, intervening, system.   This jump has about a minute loading screen where you get to look around your ship for the 10^9999th time. When you come out of this loading screen you will be next to any suns the system has to offer and your ship will be hurtling itself at the plasmatic death sphere as fast as possible. If your attention flagged for this part, you will die. If you caught your suiciding ship in the couple seconds you have then turn away from the massive ball of fire and start the process all over by starting up the charge to begin the next jump into the loading screen again. Rinse and repeat for the 20-60 jumps on your list.  -Everything Else- Now you're saying to me, hey assh*le why are you knocking on traveling so much? Because there's only 3 things to do in the game. Kill Pirates (aka bounty hunter), Kill traders (aka pirates), Trade (aka masturbators). The reason you do those things is to get that number next to 'credit' to go up. All of those require traveling. Trading involves two things and two things only. Traveling or being prey for other people (while traveling). That's it.   The other two require traveling to and from the battlefield or random traveling around the galaxy to find a rando person to pirate from. You could search for hours and never find someone to pirate.",

Even though they are for cosmetics only that is still insanely disappointing as I already paid $60!  The galaxy is huge but honestly there isn't a ton to do. There's maybe 5-6 mission types, bounties, pirating, mining, and exploration...  Exploration is supposed to be the gem in this game but with the galaxy so large the majority of the systems feel like carbon copies. Also, it's disappointing that you are resticted to your cockpit at all times. If you actually find something cool you can't really explore it or even get really close for an inquisitive peek.  The development team says they have a lot of things planned to remedy this but this isn't an early access game (not saying it shouldn't be) and the blanket protection that comes with it sadly can't be applied.   I do enjoy playing but this game shouldn't be $60. It feels like a $30 game and as it's being hyped and defended using 'planned' content it should probably still be early access.  Pass for now.",

            "review_text": "I REALLY wanted this game to be awesome, and ended up paying for both the base game (when it released) and a while after season two came out, picked up Horizons expansion pack.  Pros:  - The game is an amazing space flight simulator, and if you've got a HOTAS joystick, it's a lot of fun to fly around. ESPECIALLY if you've got a VR headset like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or whatever.  - this is a short list  Cons: - the game is an amazingly HUGE galaxy to explore, but there's not much to DO. The common analogy is 'wide as an ocean, shallow as a puddle.'  - Each ship in progression just lets you do do whatever it is you were doing a little bit better - usually at a cost of doing something else worse. For example, combat ships generally progress to get larger and larger guns, but you move slower and become less agile as you get the new ships. This is by design, to provide incentive to fly the smaller ships. They let you kill things faster, but in turn, you are unable to combat more maneuverable ships. This would be a great feature, except that the multiplayer component of the game is not really implemented in any meaningful way. For example, you can't work as a fleet (one heavy fighter, two or three light fighters for support). - There are only 4 activities to do in E:D. You can explore, you can do trading, you can do PvE bounty hunting, or you can do PvP pirating.  Exploring consists of jumping from system to system, holding a trigger down for a few seconds to do a scan, then jumping to the next system. Do this a lot, and you can earn a little money. Very little. Some dude recently spent an entire, literal earth-year exploring, and made like, 500 million credits.  Trading consists of manually picking up cargo from one station via menu selections, driving to the next station and then using the same menu to sell your cargo. Do this a lot.",

            "review_text": "I don't generally write reviews for games, but my experience with Elite Dangerous ('ED') has driven me to break my silence. This is probably the hardest game of all time for a newcomer to learn. There are no tutorials, no learning missions, nothing. Even Eve Online (notorius for being inacessible) gives you a tutorial and some noob missions to get used to the mechanics of the game. ED just plops you in a spaceship with the most idiotic controls of all time (minus the flight controls which are fine) and either expects you to remeber how everything works from a game from the 90s that no one played or watch hours of monotone youtube videos just so you can leave the freaking space port.  Defenders of the game argue that the inacessability of the game harkens back to the space sims of yesterday and the lack of hand holding is somehow rewarding for the hardcore. Honestly I call BS. The lack of in game tutorials coupled with the mindless controls is sloppy, rushed, and agravating.   So lets say my earlier comments didn't stop you from purchasing the game and watching hours of boring youtube videos just so you can leave the starting spaceport. CONGRATS you now get to traverse a gorgeous galaxy with jack didly squat to do. If you like flying mindlessly through space with no objectives or story, ED is the Microsoft Space Flight Simulator of your pathetic dreams.  Long story short, I retuned the game (thanks steam) bought Rebel Galaxy and had more fun in the first 30 seconds (mostly due to its amazing Firefly-esque soundtrack) than I ever could have had in ED. 1/10 would not inflict brain dammage again. 1 is for space being awesome.",

For $60 you get to explore a virtually infinite universe, land on planets with vegetation, animals, and sentient life.

It's stunningly beautiful. Everything you look at is top notch in graphical quality, and the music, it's amazing. However, the game itself can compared to endless appointment with the dentist that loves drilling.   The UI is horrible, it follows exactly zero UI conventions and takes significant time to learn and even then stuff in it is just cluttered and categorized downright horribly. You can learn to travel pretty easily, but managing contacts in space, warping, slowing down, managing weaponry mid fight, managing modules, looting, learning about targets and using maps mid flight is just a masterpiece of mess.  The stations are all the same, because they've been reduced to menu's. This means that you've got no connection to your ship, stuff you trade, missions you do, people who give them or benefit from them, all the factions and powerplay it all becomes completely meaningless. They could all be reduced to abrevations and numbers and it wouldn't make a slightest difference. Nothing has any impact on anything, other than a very annoying but thank god short list of artificial limitations. What's the point of not allowing me to bring food to a station on a mission, if I've been trading it to there for hours, just because my [random categorization stat] is not equal to 'Pedler' or what ♥♥♥♥ ever.  There is absolutely no story. No quest line. And nothing to hold your hand showing what's possible. Trust me, you'd need one, but instead you're shot by AI if you loiter in space for more than 180 seconds. Not a single module/ship/stat/damage/purpose is appropriate explained, not even a failheap of ingame wiki. When you have no sense of progression in either knowledge of the game world, or clearly communicated numbers, you feel completely at lost if you don't spend ages watching videos.  You can hyper warp extreme distances with pinpoint accuracy to always arrive 3km away from the surface of the sun, but you can't warp from station to station. So you end up taking 15 seconds to travel between solar systems, but 30 minutes to get to the nearest station in one. You can scan anything from several AU's away, but you can't maintain a list of contacts in one solar system so you could fly to them. You can buy instantly and anywhere you want all cartography material of all known universe and you can instantly tell the mission giver that you've arrived at the destination, but you can't pull trade data (or store it) from 1 station away you just visited. You can buy the cheapest of modules to harvest the energy of the sun for your hyperdrive fuel by flying near it's corona, but your lasers run out of power in 10 seconds and you take heat damage from overheated batteries. You can aim your warp to a 10 LY away star, but you can't aim your guns to 800m.   Which leads me to the worst. The multiplayer. There are none of the expected minimum social communication methods or community tools in the game. You cant see others, you can see where you could meet others, you can't effectively see communitie's details. You can create a group, but you've got hard time figuring out where others are on any level of the universe be it in the galaxy map, solar system map, in warp or at same grid with you. The only social you get is a chat, and you may or may not recognize other players from their CMDR tag after they've killed you (as no one uses the chat, ever). So if you were looking for a multiplayer game, you better bring your own friends. Oh and no, you dont start near each other or easily get to play together, what would that be. None of the content is created with the ideology that a group would be better that a sum of its parts, none. Grouping is fun only in because players like to be social, game-wise grouping is a punishment on all efficiency.",

However, after the 100th system you jump to, that pretty much looks like any of the other countless numbers of systems in the game, offering the same cookie cutter fetch, bounty hunting, and courier quests, it gets old fast. I thought to myself, 'Ok, I'll just come back to this game in a few months when they add some new content, maybe some long term objectives to strive for.'  They added factions, and combat zones. K, great, except the game is huge. I almost never run into other players.  So I waited some more.  Then they finally announced the ability to land on planets and whatnot, and I thought, 'Ok this is cool. Probably something that should have been in the original game--- SIXTY DOLLARS?!' So I waited some more to see what reviews popped up about the new content, to guage whether it was worth $60. It wasn't. Now I hear they're adding even more expansions that porbably should have been a part of the original game.   So now, if I want to experience something more than flying around hunting down the same AI over and over again, to buy a bigger ship, to hunt down more AI also in bigger ships, I'm gonna have to spend over $100 on top of the $60 I already paid. Sorry, not happening.  I paid full price for what I expected to be a pretty awesome game, and got something that should have been labeled a beta, something I wouldn't have paid more than $25 for.",

The trailer is super flat out bogus. There is no characters you have to buy an expansion that will eventually supposedly let you have a character for 60 more bucks. The ships dont fly like in the trailer which i know never believe a trailer but to be flat out wrong.  4.

Spent many hours in this game before steam was even thought of and it gets pretty boring fast.  6. There is only 3 things to do in this game. Fight, Trade, and Explore. which exploring is pointless once you see about 10 systems they are all the same just repeated over and over and over and over again. Nothing different. Boring. 7. which a continuation of 6 theres nothing to do anymore aaaahhhhh. 8. on a real note I feel like i shouldnt of paid more than 20 bucks for this game. To get my 20 bucks worth i try and try to log back in and just cant because of all the bad experiences that ive had that i know havent been fixed( i do log in and check then go right out again). Dont waste your money unless you truly are a space fan and just like doing the same thing over and over again.  9. Dont get conn'ed with the trailer for horizons because you see the trailer for elite is complete garbage. 10. you are a ship not a person even when you line two ships nose to nose there is an empty chair. 11. Ship doesnt turn like a space ship it acts as if you're in an atmosphere like really i cant turn left or right fast??? I do understant that it might be a gameplay decision but that really killed the space sim for me. 12.The tutorials are not complete at all. I did all tutorials and have no experience from their previous games then had to quit to youtube how to play.  13.I absolutely get no satisfaction or fullfilment from this game games are supposed to be fun and exciting. This game after about 2 hours you will realize its all the same Conclusion: I am a gamer have been my whole life and i stream this is truly my opinion on this game maybe if i spent 20 instead of 60 i might not feel this way but 20 is the usual going price for early access for an alpha game that is why i used 20 as the figure. Which this game seems to be in alpha still with all of its problems and lack of features. On a good note: sounds are on par with modern games, visuals look great for the first couple of times then you see the same thing over and over again, and star map looks good.",

Never mind if you are playing'solo mode' or 'open play' or whatnot, you are always connected to the server, time passes in real time, and YOU CANNOT PAUSE. The only difference between solo play and open play is whether you see other players or not. Everything else happens in real time. So if you are in the middle of something and need to, say, answer the phone, you can't just hit Escape and then pick up wherever you left off. Unless you log out, by the time you come back your ship can be destroyed by a passing hostile NPC.  - Mission timers also tick in real time, even if you are logged out. Don't have the time to complete a mission today and want to pick it up tomorrow? Tough luck, by tomorrow it will have timed out and you get fined for not completing it.  - There are literally three or four pages of key bindings. Expect to spend the first couple hours fiddling with key binds just to make the game work.  - The interface is one of the worst designed ever. Tons of stuff that is not obvious, endless menus everywhere, in most cases mouse can't be used to navigate, and when it can be used, it just adds to the overall kludginess.  - Don't expect to just jump in and figure stuff out. Reading the manual and watching training videos is required because of the unintuitive elements that will trip you up and get you killed.  - Awful community full of smug elitists (haw haw) with too much time on their hands. Most requests for help and advice are answered with snarky banter and a link to the PDF manual or training videos. Look kids, we get it: you're too scared to leave the house and can't cut the mustard in EVE Online. But that doesn't make you a collection of teenage einsteins.

Elite is the first game that has literally managed to bore me to tears, and I'm not even exaggerating, I didn't think it's even possible I've never had this happening with any other game ever before.  I believe it's simply the build up of all the dozens of tedious little frustrating rituals and pointless micro management the game forces you to endure over and over again to accomplish even the most basic features of the game that just gnaws at your patience and pushes you away and makes this easilly the most beginner hostile game I belive I've ever seen.    -Overshooting your target everytime in supercruise. -Jittery cargo scoop that keeps throwing you off at the last seconds forcing you to re-try 2-3 times. -Painstaking difficulty of trying to find specific things such as smugglers or pirates. -The overall difficulty of using the UI to target a specific ship or object you're looking for. -Combat is exceedingly rare even when you actively seek it, it took me 10 hours of gameplay to get into my first fight. -A.I ships cannot miss you if they have their weapons pointing at you so your piloting skills ammount to nothing. -You cannot outrun A.I ships at normal thrusters so you're always forced to supercruise out of the engagement or die. -Perfectly symmetrical space stations that have you flying in circles for ages looking for the landing bay. -20+ minute supercruise trips from one end of a system to the other. -Seemingly no way to interract with other players at all. -Space stations are just parking slots from which you upgrade your stats. -The time it takes to move away from a planets and other large object to get away from the mass lock.   I'm sure this list would be twice as long if I were to keep playing it but Elite: Dangerous feels like too much work with 0% satisfaction from anything you do, getting a new ship and upgrading it means you're only opening yourself for more boring chores to do which usually involve just fetching something from somewhere.

The first few hours were amazing but when the 'wow-factor' wore off it became clear that this is probably the best tech demo I have ever played.   I gave it try after try because I thought I was maybe missing something. I even dropped 37.50€ on that scam they call expansion. But in the end I realized that the game is just dead empty space that offers nothing.   You might say how can it be empty it is clearly marketed as MMO. Well the game is heavily instanced and for one instance only allowing 32 players. So you will never experience huge space battles between two rival player factions. Furthermore even if you are in a wing with your buddy you often are unable to get into the same instance. ED also lacks other social mechanics that every respectable MMO has. So technically it is a MMO but in my eyes it needs to go a long way to earn that title.   The activities that ED offers are Mining, Trading (+ smuggling), Combat, Exploration and missions that make you do the previous mentioned things.   I guess they nailed mining cause in my head it is boring as ♥♥♥♥ and within the game it is also boring as ♥♥♥♥. You just sit there firing your laser and collecting little pieces that break loose until your cargo is full. Sadly the reward ration to time spend + boredom of the activity does not feel right.   The activity of trading is also nailed by the game, you buy goods on station A and sell them on station B. Sadly that does not affect the universe at all. In my time doing that (which was easily 70% of my total play time) the demand never changed. They always wanted my goods and the price also did not change which makes this activity very shallow and not thought through. Furthermore the market information you are getting is a joke. They promised an overhaul to them ages ago and never delivered. Smuggling is equally dumb because you can't even buy things from the black market on stations. Only sell to it.   Some people suggested I should try combat so I did that. Outfitted my ship nicely for the task. Only to drop out of SC to find out the AI of NPCs is broken. Often times they just spun in place or didn't even fire at me. So that got dull very fast. Since the AI is broken even taking down bigger ships was no problem.   At the end of my playtime I tried exploration. Welp you just jump from system to system fire of your scanner, scan all the bodies and move on. If you are lucky you might see something truly stunning but it's probably better to just watch some videos or search for some images. If you have the patience you can fly into the far reaches of our galaxy and get your name on some objects. Also from a monetary standpoint exploration is the worst.   If you think power play might be something interesting you are dead wrong since it barely provides any lore and the characters you can support are again shallow. Furthermore the impact you have through that system on the universe is barely noticeable. The unique weapons you can unlock through that system are also in no way worth the time you need to invest.   Since they told us they would have 10 years of updates, every year is a paid expansion, you should just wait until there is a definitive edition of the game available. Maybe it'll have some depth by then or maybe it is dead because SC and NMS ripped the non hardcore community out of ED and FD can't finance the remaining years of expansions anymore.

If you want a shallow game space sim where all you do is fly around and visit spaceports then you should defintely pick this up. There is no story, nothing to do thats really exciting and overly complicated controls. Now I'll break it down:  PROS:  - Visually stunning, smooth gameplay. The game looks and feels amazing to play. The ships handle nicely (If you use a keyboard. I've tried a controller and joystick setup and they both arent as good).  - Immersive. This game sets the perfect atmosphere. It nails exactly what I'd expect the future to look like.  - Customization is very good (Lack of ships though).   CONS: - Everything about the game is overly complicated. If you expect to dive into this game and start having fun that wont be the case. You'll be learning for the first few hours more than likely. If you dont feel like doing that you can always play/watch the hours of tutorials they put in for you. Its not fun to learn but once you get it down its pretty cool and you feel like Han Solo pushing all your space buttons. - Mission system. Heres how it works so you'll understand; there are spaceports all over the galaxy that you can dock your ship at and access something called 'Spaceport Services'. In those services you can go to the missions board where all the avilable missions for that spaceport will be listed. Heres the problem, most of them you cant do. Why? Because you arent a high enough level (Why would you list missions for me that I cant do???). On top of that, some missions that you are able to accept cant actually be done because they are too far away for your ship to jump. Some missions arent exactly clear on where or what youre supposed to do. The person who thought that was a good idea is a few fries short of a happy meal if you know what I mean.  - Travel times. I understand that space travel would actually take a long time but this is a video game. Players dont want to sit there for 5 minutes waiting for a jump to finish. If i can be flying my ship and take my hands off the keyboard and mouse to play with my phone while I wait to reach a destination then theres something wrong with your game. - DLC is definitely not worth 20$ - Combat is kind of awkward and short. Weapons lock on automatically so all you're really doing is keeping them in your sights while pushing left mouse.  - Upon death, anything you have bought for your ship (paintjobs, weapons, utilities etc.) will have to be repurchased. INCLUDING YOUR SHIP.   Went on a salvage mission. Got to the wreckage, found black box. Started to retrieve, hear 4 ships drop out of supercruise behind me. Get destroyed so fast I dont even have time to react. Recommended level was mine. Took me 10 minutes to reach where I needed to go, have to spawn all the way back at beginning.

I don't expect hand holding and even without it I did manage to fumble my way through how to do some things, but I did get sick of playing and then googling things that I have no idea how to do that I potentially came accross.   YouTube videos are great and do help but I came to play not watch hours of tutorials and believe me the game mechanics are quite deep.

All that said there will be moments where no matter what you do as a player you will be killed, losing massive ammounts of progress. Glitches make many missions unable to finish which can then lead to penalities agaisnt your player. This has been in the 'fixed in the next patch' for a few patches and I've only logged over 24 hours. It has never been fixed and usually each patch brings more bugs than they fix.  Combat bugs are riddled throughout in 2.1 I'm sure they will begin to fix them but I wouldn't hold your breath. Previously I would say you could try the base game without the DLC add-ons and be competitive and hold your own. However now you must purchase the DLC to be on par with AI/NPC enemy ships who will have DLC weapons and mods.   There is such great promise here which has never been realized. The high points are high but so many bugs and low points that leave you wondering why you're still playing. I've done bounty hunting, minning, and delivery. They are all fun for the first short while then become EXTREMLEY REPITITIVE. There is no variety.   Space trucking is fun, if you like any of the truck simulators or the sort of 'job as a game' style of games and enjoy space exploration of any kind this is a must for a handful of hours. I can't recommend it though as after 20-40 hours you will have done everything this game has to offer.",

I was hoping to fly around and complete missions with other people, without a guild component it's impossible to find interested people.  Put in more hours and read some of the forums, seems this game is for people that want solo play, which begs why add a Massive Online component? (It's really a Massive Singleplayer Online Space Sim).  As far as the space sim goes, it's a ton of empty space with targetting reticles, after 5 to 10 minutes of flying to get to your destination to see 1 object (Space station, platform, planet), do a little something and go fly through blackness stars and targetting reticuls some more.  I was hoping for something closer to X-Wing, battlefront, ect..., something with decent space battles, where the MMO component would kick in and we could easily group up vs spacestations, battle cruisers, ect...  Sadly it's really more about 1-3 vs 1-3. Not much to be had in coordinated combat, so if you like going from point A to point B to hand in cargo for hours on end, this is the game for you.  Also, get use to 'Docking Request Denied'.",

However, after a bunch of hours playing in the last week and experiencing these changes, I can safely say...the game is still boring! I tried out transporting passengers. Apparently this was the biggest payout at one point but FD nerfed it as well as other missions to the point that making the most money revolves again, around trade. Once you find a good trade route it is still the most profitable and safest way to make money.   But again I ask you. What is the point of making money? There is no substance to the universe. No storyline to follow. Sure, you can buy a huge ship and have fighter bays etc. Maybe you'll get more fun out of that ship, or you'll end up hating it. Frontier has nerfed making money to the point of it turning into boring, endless grinding. You have to grind rep with minor factions to be able to get paid any decent amount of money, and this has to be done in EVERY system you visit. Some factions are in other systems so this isn't always the case. But, your best bet is to grind the factions in one system and then just stay there.  I still find the gameplay dull and lifeless. It's great that voice acting as been added in the stations. That's suberb for immersion reasons. But the game has no substance. No reason to keep you grinding money so you can buy a bigger ship. You can't build structures with that money. If you could build stuctures on moons then yes, it would seem worth it to grind more income. Maybe, if you had to pay your crew members every month or, you had to eat food, and had to use credits to buy food so you don't die.",

Elite: Dangerous gives one of the most stunning visuals and realism to have graced the gaming scene ever, as far as space flight sims would go. But would I recommend it? Definitely not.  This game started as a kickstarter project. The concept was extremely nice, and the end result was stunning visuals and graphics, plus the awesome realism.  But then as I played, The flaws become more and more coherent:  Pros: - Good visuals. Lacking on the special effects for weapon fire though. - Extremely good sound design. Wish pilots actually talked more though instead of text. - Realistic controls. The most realistic controls you will ever feel for a space sim. - Dogfights are very tactical, and not just aim and fire. - Huge, HUGE universe. True to its promise of a 1:1 scale Milky Way.  Cons: - Get RNG-produced missions. Deliver, Kill, Mine. Some slight variations, enjoyable at first, but becomes evidently and extremely repetative after 20+ hours. - Extreme grind. Which would be OK, if the world FELT MORE ALIVE. - Dead. Empty. There are about 6000+ players online, but I can't see anyone. - NO GLOBAL CHAT. It doesn't help that you can't even chat with people who are actually online. - Very bad network infrastructure. Peer-to-peer. You want to play with friends not in your Wing? Log-in and log-out repeatedly. Good luck getting in the same instance. - Instance-based world. For an extremely large sandbox, a peer-to-peer, instance-based infrastructure is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. - Where are the mega-ships that are actually atleast 100x bigger than you? I was expecting to actually see them in-game. - Dumb-♥♥♥ AI. The game is supposed to be realistic. So you're in a Conflict Zone to make sure you don't get ♥♥♥♥♥ by the strong enemy? Frontier says ♥♥♥♥ you, because even after choosing a target currently going mano a mano with another ship, said enemy will shift focus on you immediately, and other ship leaves your target for another one. - Did I mention the NPCs have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t loadouts? Infinite Heat Sinks, Railguns that shoot 5 times in 3 seconds, EMCs to ruin your lock, and Infinite Shield Canisters. IN A SIDEWINDER.  - Devs obviously go dip-in and dip-out of the game as they please. They seem to go on a vacation after a week-long hardwork of releasing an over-priced expansion that SHOULD HAVE BEEN free, it being a required core mechanic of the game. - Money-grabbing, greedy devs. Nuff said.  It's quite sad that the devs of this game actually succeeded in attracting players with eye candy and ear candy. The game is well-conceptualized, but EXTREMELY poorly executed.

The game looks great, it plays great, the sounds and music are spot on (I love the homage to 2001 when you dock), and it's very smooth and relatively easy to play if you use a controller or flight stick.   My only real issue is the lack of depth in the game as it stands now. You can either go around hunting bad (wanted) guys, haul cargo, or mine asteroids - that's it. Sure, you can explore, but there really isn't anything to explore since any new planets you find, you can't actually do anything with them. There is no 'campaign' or story driven aspect to the game either, you just roam around aimlessly. Supposedly they are going to add the ability to land on and explore planets, but it's something like an $80 add on pack (as I write this that was the price) and that was on top of the $45 I paid for the game already. No thanks, I'm not paying over $100 (or more seeing as how you can buy better ships for real money) in order to play this game any further.   This was the first new PC game that I have purchased in like 15 years (since I just got back into PC gaming) and I was hoping for so much more. Honestly, if space and planetary exploration are your thing, save your money for when No Man's Sky comes out (unless you like doing one of the three things I mentioned above). This game has SO much potential and would be nearly perfect if it was a full experience (which it may be once they continue adding content at an added cost of course).",

Not only that but they are now releasing 'seasons' of DLC which are going to be $60 each.  The graphics and physics are well done but the gameplay itself is surprisingly shallow once you sink a good number of hours into it. All of the things you can do seem to lack any sort of variation which causes them to get repetative very quickly. It's like they rushed out all facets of the game as fast as possible without actually making sure they were fully fleshed out and fun. After ~50 hours this game becomes a grind and lacks any fun at all. The lack of ship variety and ship customization is the real nail in the coffin. Some weapons are way stronger than others making a tiny portion of all options actaully feasable.   - Mining (a solo borefest that takes hours of manual labor to make any sort of profit) - Exploring (another solo only experience that is very fun at first but once you've discovered the limited amount of variation it just becomes warp jump simulator 2015. why haven't they implemented some sort of buddy exploring system?) - Bounty hunting (kill some NPC with a scary name to get credits. There is no story line so you don't care about anyone or anything here) - Trading (only feasable once you get a large ship and then you realize it's just as boring as when you had a small ship) - Factions (no idea what the hell is going on here. no explanation of how they work. it seems like they aren't worth your time but I honestly don't know because everything is so poorly explained)  In my opinion the original game seemed more like a $30 tech demo which would have been fine... but for that price tag there are most definetly better games out there right now.",

However the current powerplay update and announcement of the seperate CQC mode I feel the game is becoming akin to a compendium of games that only really have the box in common.  FD also seem adept at breaking their own game with every patch and update as well as making design choices that seem lazy and aimed at restricting my achievements to point where I lose progress just by not being online. They have introduced decay mechanics that lessen your faction standings while not playing so going on holiday can lose you hours of reputation gain.

Its balanced so that a crummy ship with good pilot can stand chance again a mid grade ship with a crummy pilot. It has the basis for all the elements to make a good game. But getting up to that point is a pain. Its difficult at first to get started as the game is very confusing. Hope you have a joystick with a throttle control because a mouse and keyboard are useless, especially with the starting setting.   Recomend watching a few youtube videos on getting started. It will take you a while to get started. Once you do the game starts to get fun, You can go explore, kill people for bounties, go plunder traders in anarchy systems, smuggle drugs (biggest money maker I found). It wil be a lot of fun... for a while. After you've done all that you pick something you like to do and makes money. After a while it will feel repetitive. So you'll try something new, get fustrated, go exploring and be 100 jumps away from civiliation when your bored of it and then want to be home so now you spend the next hour + just getting back home. All while you are trying to make a lot of money to get a better ship. It gets repetive.   Also anytime you go somewhere they will interdict you (pull you out of crusing speed) and scan your ship. 90% its the police which you can just punch it and boost away before they scan so its really anoying. The game is not well balanced at all. Mining is still way undervalued as a profession because you can make more killing people trying to steal from miners or even more if you smuggle drugs.   The powerplay (factions) thing seems really cool, but had to watch a 4 part youtube video to even explain it. But it seems to be a late game thing because doing it early game will net you very very low profits (like gas money + a tip). Late game you can be making a lot of money it seems like.  All in all, decent game that is fun for a while but falls short for keeping attention. A lot of balancing issues. Would be helpful to have something in the game explain what stuff is, however defer to youtube. So in the end, decent while you wait for Star Citizen. ",

The game is very slow paced, mostly flying through emptiness with the same backgrounds all the time. You cannot explore planets as of yet. There are no nebulas to fly through, if there are hey will take a few hours to fly to. Trading, mining, and exploring are cool features though combat is the fastest way to make bank. Ship maneuverability is severely limited in Yaw (which is unrealistic given the speed of the left and right thrusters). The biggest issue I have with maneuverability is you cannot turn off the inertial dampners, and there are annoying and arbitrary throttle limiters for both accel and deccel depending on your destination and location.  If you watched the gameplay and have friends who are into it definitely give it a try, but only buy when it is really cheap.",

The game has a lot to it in terms of things to do, whether it be trading, bounty hunting, mining, exploration, pirating, smuggling, or any mixture of whatever you want to do. But to me, the major thing that makes me no want to recommend this game is its delivery. There are factions you can belong to, trade markets that fluctuate based on real player's activity, and different ships with countless customization options.   Although there is so much to do, the only logical thing to do is to trade. For anybody who likes getting the little number telling them their total credits or whatever in a game will find that they can really only enjoy trading, as it is far easier and SO much more lucrative for the time put into it.  The bounty hunting system is a little silly, as the only way to do it is to sit around people who you think might have a bounty and scan them, rather than having some cool list that says all of the commander's names and which system they were last seen.  The pirating mechanic is just as tedious as the bounty hunting system.  I wish I could say more about the other career, which leads me to my next point about the delivery. Even though I have put a good number of hours into the game, so many things are still so far off in terms of my ability to start doing them. For example, exploration requires a decently expensive ship with quite a few very expensive upgrades, so for me the idea of exploring enough for it to actually be lucrative is far off enough for me not to really feel motivated to try to get there.   The coop is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and so far I’ve only been able to play like an hour with a friend on my “wing” before something disconnected or something. The other 2 hours I put towards trying to play with friends went towards troubleshooting the various issues we were having.   As much as this game has to offer, and as much as I would like to give this game a good rating, I don’t feel as though I got my money’s worth. I paid 60 dollars for the game, and I feel as though the actual hours I did put into this game were so that I might feel as though I hadn’t wasted my money. The most annoying part is that pretty much all of the issues I have with this game can be fixed with an update to the game.

            "review_text": "Frontier Developments is completely inept when you peel away the layers. They create what seems like a polished, massive, thriving universe in which you are completely insignificant. It's slated as a sandbox game, and is often likened to MMOs due to its MMO-like social qualities. However, beneath the surface of pretty graphics, an immensely fun flight model, and a lot of hype, their game is incredibly shallow.  Markets are static and reset on a periodic tick. They do not change dynamically with player behavior. There is no player-driven economy or trading in this game. All trading is essentially moving imaginary units from point A to point B for credits, either as rewards from trading missions or simple profits from selling something where it is worth higher than where you bought it. Although markets gradually change very subtly, they do not genuinely reflect player actions.  PvE combat is dull and repetitive. NPCs are ungodly stupid and predictable. They remain extremely predictable throughout the difficulty progression, but eventually accuracy and health are increased significantly. It's poorly executed and feels like you are fighting robots at every level. It's very uninspired, and I honestly can't get into it.  That doesn't mean you have a choice though. If you want to earn money, you are going to have to find a grind. Whether monotonously shooting the lifeless NPCs, jumping back and forth like a ♥♥♥♥♥ with trade units, or taking on various missions that all feel relatively the same, you are going to need to repeat whatever you're doing so much that you're going to get sick of it in order to get the credits you need to actually play around with the toys in this game.  Mining is okay as far as PvE goes. I'd say this game probably has one of the better renditions of space mining in a game, but it does get really boring after a while.  PvP is hated by a large portion of the community because the developer favors and panders to carebears and forumdads. If you are a complete roleplaying ♥♥♥♥♥ with no interest in ever getting good at the game you play, you'll probably love this pretentious and hypocritical batch of whiners that comprise the majority of the Elite Dangerous player community.  As for PvP mechanics themselves-- we've had highs and lows, and the lows just keep getting lower. There have been times much earlier in the game's life that the PvP was fun, relatively balanced compared to what it is now, and enjoyed a level of depth that contradicts the rest of this game entirely. Ironically, although the developer seems to deplore PvP, it was the most deeply developed mechanic in the game and arguably still is... despite being horribly broken and imbalanced by just moronic development decisions.  Development often seems to hinge on the sounds that come out of their echochamber official forums. A constituency of old 'Boomers and Gen Xers that backed the development of this game have pretty much assumed control of all moderation on these forums, so they are a very slanted place. Anyone that thinks differently than the common culture there is ostracized. It's a pretty big groupthink mentality of carebears and victims. Many horrendous development decisions have been based on the whining, screaming, and petitioning that goes on here by these individuals. Development by committee, when the committee is filled with entitled morons that don't know a good game mechanic from an awful one.  The Engineers update involves tons of grind and RNG based gameplay as well (multiple layers of RNG) and can be an enormous time sink that yields little rewards. It's yet another one of the horrible ideas of Frontier. It's such a shame because there was the foundation for an amazing game here but it seems impossible that it will ever reach its potential with this developer in control of it.   You may look at my gametime and think 'Wow, for a game he so strongly seems to dislike, he sure did play it a lot.' What I can say in regard to that is that about 500 hours out of that was simply grind to earn money and ranks so I could buy and use the ships I wanted (because that's how long it will take unless you are using exploits), in addition to having money available to completely outfit things and be able to afford to die in them without permanently losing them. Then the remainder of that time I spent PvPing with the small portion of the community that engages in PvP (quite avidly). Wing fights used to be extremely fun, and 1v1s or ganks are also a lot of fun in the space combat that was possible in Elite Dangerous. I participated with a group of players that specialized in PvP and enjoyed it immensely. However, Frontier has repeatedly destroyed the balance in this game and turned it into a distorted version of rock, paper, scissors in which skill is really much less important than selecting an optimal meta build to counter whomever you intend on fighting. It's really low brow, low skill, stupid gameplay now. I saw a lot of potential in this game when I started playing over a year ago, but the developer has completely destroyed my confidence that this game will move forward to succeed. It simply lacks any strong competition in the genre right now.  The worst thing about this game is its marketed as a complete game + expansions, although this is entirely false. The game continues to be changed at the fundamental levels as if it were still in alpha, and the level of content that actually makes up the game is pretty pitiful. The universe feels huge at first, but then everything gets repetitive and you no longer feel immersed at all. Too much of the game is a time sink and a grind, and there is not much that is rewarding to do. Most of the ships look pretty lame, and all ship customizations are obtained through micro-transactions. As much as $15 for a single ship skin. Don't buy this game.",

Also I've found quite a few annoyances, such as  1. Why the hell does it matter which way my ship is facing when I dock at a station. As long as landing gear is deployed and touching the station, which way I face doesn't matter. What makes it worse is when you launch, there is a turntable that turns you around, making it unnecessary to orient it in the first place.  2. I don't understand why I can't have hardpoints deployed when I supercruise or hypercruise. This is space.  3. Navigation just sucks so hard. The navigation computer of the future cannot calculate the travel distance to a certain place, without taking into consideration the decelerating speed that is needed to get out of supercruise.  4. 500 billion galaxies that don't have any feel.

It has a background simulated universe that you can interact with to an extent, though the developers did explicitly clarify that your role in the universe will be fairly irrelevant as an individual - unless you join a large group of other players with the same goal. You can find many pros and cons in other reviews, but I would like to emphasise on this point:  - Frontier Developments is a relatively small team of developers with little experience in designing fun video-games. The hardcore fans will showcase the handful of games that they have created to justify their experience, but the developers still have a lot to learn in regards with what makes a video-game fun. The developers have a very good think-tank team, though they have poor executioners. I completely understand their vision, however I cannot forsee this game attracting as many players as they would like. This game has a very niche target market and cannot expand its reach without the average video-gamer perceiving this game as a rip-off. This severely affects the game since the developers rely on the players' intitiative to conduct any meaningful experience in this game. Sad to say that to this date there is still a large number of players who seek pleasure through other players' frustration (Schadenfreude syndrome). Yet, the developers have done very little to reduce the incentive to do so. All in all, the developers really have identified the wrong focus and objectives that led to the sheer number of negative reviews. There are many other video-games that are critically reviewed with a long list of cons, but overall the game is still recommended, simply because the developers have identified the correct list of objectives to focus on in order to appeal to video-gamers despite the bugs, glitches, etc.  I really enjoyed playing this game, and I still do play this game. The only reason that keeps me playing Elite Dangerous is the community that I managed to connect with. This goes to show that the video-game has very little to offer in perspective of a fun video-game.",

Or better yet, keep reading and decide whether you want to support a company that screws over it's existing customers.    If you already own Elite: Dangerous, I'd advise against the expansion. Because Frontier is screwing you.  You paid $44.99 for the original game. Now Frontier wants to charge you an additional $49.99 (for a limited time, it seems their price will increase after some period) . Their idea of rewarding you for being a loyal customer is to charge you a total of $99.98 for the same content they sell to a new customer for $49.99.  Nice of them, isn't it? Is that a company worthy of support?   My answer is no. Frontier will never see another thin dime from me. If I could give ten thumb's down, I would. It's not that I dont' have the money to spend, either.  The reader is left to decide for themself.  Edit: 14 Dec 2015 As of this morning, existing ED players now have the limited time opportunity to buy Horizons for 59.99 and receive a 15 dollar discount plus access to a new ship. So now the math works out that an existing customer will have paid 94.99 (includes the 15 dollar discount) for essentially the same content that a new player can purchase for 59.99. That new ship must really be a doozy if it's worth 35 bucks!  Additionally, my posts in the community forum in regards to the treatment of existing customers have been deleted.  Frontier's policies just continue to get sleazier and sleazier.  Is this a company you want to support?   .. and now banned from the community discussion forum for the following post:   Just updated my review to include the new pricing I see today, and the fact that Frontier deleted my posts from this forum criticizing them for their treatment of existing customers in regards to 'dlc' pricing.  From what I see at the Frontier store, a new user can buy Horizons for 59.99, where an existing customer can (for a limited time) buy for 59.99, receive a 15 dollar discount, and a new ship.  Lets do the math, shall we? New customer gets ED and Horizons for 59.99  Existing customer has spent 49.99 on ED, and now can buy Horizons for just 44.99, for a total expenditure of 94.98.  That puts the value of the new ship at 34.99. That must be some ship!  Get it together Frontier.  And if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me by replying here rather than cowardly removing my posts.

Then, the whole single-player advertisiment is quite misleading -- if you select single-player, you're put into demo mode which, I can only assume is some sort of brain-dead, feature-disabled version of a game you paid way too much for.  Hint: MMO's - grow a sack and indicate whether or not your game is PvE, PvP, or both.  Once you hop into the game, the AI recommends you go (offsite?? really!?!) to view the training demo. I've been playing sims for over three decades.... getting behind the controls of this ... thing was, at best, janky. The steering seems to be a combination of twirling around in concentric circles until you get a reticlue lined-up. (Yeah, I didn't go out-of-game to watch the stupid video because I just paid $50 for a game I actually wanted to play...)   And wtf happened to the character generation screen? Virtually no options except the default. I am assuming that if you shell-out more $$$, you can get some sort of additional feature set.  Unbelievably unimpressed.

Otherwise you should probably wait a year and check back.  Very grindy.  Lack of interesting content.  Exploration is extremely dull. You hold down the mouse button to locate planets, then drive up to a planet or star and point your ship's nose at it to get a detailed scan. It's time consuming and boring. I went on a 5 day exploration trip to deep space, and by day 2 I was ready to claw out my own eyeballs with boredom.  Powerplay is a badly designed mess. It was pushed to live after only a week in beta. The devs make major mechanics changes to it weekly, which frusterates players because their strategies that were designed around now obsoleted mechanics are rendered ineffective. Powerplay is also highly focused on grind. Haul generic resources here. Kill x number of npc ships in this zone. Repeat every week.  The market interface is pretty awful. The only way to look up prices is to dock at a station, and then you only get to see prices at that specific station. It can be difficult to find specific modules for your ships if ther aren't sold where you are currently docked. Apparently the concept of wide area networking has been lost to the citizens of the future.  Veteran players frequently get bored and return to starter systems with their Anaconda to insta-gank new players, before getting bored with that too.",

            "review_text": "The game makes a great simulator for the most part, but that's about it. I really didn't find it fun at all. The jobs are pretty scarce until you climb the ranking system, but even then it's pretty limited to deliver the package, or go get the package and bring it back, or go kill this guy. The assassination missions are also really difficult to complete. Sometimes you get screwed because the target simply outclasses your skills or your ships capabilities, and sometimes you just flat out can't find the target to begin with. There is no inner system beacon to your quarry. You have to hunt him down, and you may not find him.  So what's wrong with that? Nothing really if you love the simulated reallity of it. Yet, the whole game is very realistic in terms of forcing you to find everything manually, land and take off manually, fly from one place to another manually, etc. Its all manual, and in a game that requires you to travers massive distances through space on every mission it gets tedious. Very very tedious.  Expect transport times of at least 5-10 minutes, dock for 2 minutes, buy/sell stuff and grab missions is instant but then you have to undock and fly to the next point. So 95% of your time is just flying around to get from one place to another. Combat is cool, but also can be either really imbalanced or tedious. Either you die instantly because your ship isn't good enough and the enemy takes out your powerplant with a single hit, or you are flying around in circles for ever trying to kill the enemy before his shields come back online and you have to chew through them again.  Is it a bad game? No, it's a space simulation. The part of it that is 'game' is pretty fun to be honest. I enjoyed the trading and logistics part, the combat isn't bad if it weren't so dissapointing when you took 15min to get to it only to find out you are now screwed without a chance of winning, and to top it off the exploration part was kind of intriguing. Except you need a lot of credits to get the surface scanner that actually makes it worthwhile to be an explorer.  So in the end, I wouldn't recommend it. Remembering back to Freelancer, I loved that game. The travel wasn't half as tedious. You can have massive expanses of space but you only have to hint at long travel times. 2mins to a destination without having to micro manage your speed for fear of overshooting it is perfectly fine. I didn't really want to buy a flight sim. I wanted to buy an amazing space game with lots of dogfighting, trading, and missions. What I got was a solid, gorgeous space flight simulator with mini games.",

            "review_text": "I bought the game on day 1, but the recent No Mans Sky incident finally motivated me to write a review. First off, even the base game is FAR better than NMS in a lot of ways, from gameplay to graphics to the sense of immersion you get. The game so far has been very stable for me, even at high graphics and resolution settings. But there are some things about the game which they don't mention but everyone ought to know before buying in my view:  TL;DR The game is always online, new DLC will make it infinitely deeper and more fun but will cost a lot and will take time to be fully realized, it has microtransactions for skins and bobble heads. Recomended if you have the cash for DLC or enjoy looking at pretty stars and planets, not recomended if your internet connection is ♥♥♥♥.    - Always online:  The game is ALWAYS ONLINE, so if that's a problem for you, now you know! The single player tag on steam is just plain misleading, it's technically true but the offline mode still requires you to connect to a server and losing the connection kicks you out of the game. The game DOES NOT have an offline singleplayer option. For this reason, it doesn't rellay feel like 'your game', it feels like frointier developments has hesitantly lended it to you and always suspiciosly leaning over your shoulder to check to make sure you don't have too much fun with modding it or somehow skipping the soul crushingly boring grindy stuff by changing game files.  I wouldn't make a big deal out of this if they had just stated upfront that it's always online, but they don't, which is a shame. I had to find out the hard way when I bought it day 1 and played for a while, then couldn't get out of hyperdrive because I have a bad internet connection and each spacestation or event is an instance that needs to be loaded in from the server. If you don't mind the always online, it's a pretty good game as is, however:  - Expansions!   There is also another thing that they don't mention but should be made explicitely clear before you buy: It's going to get infinitely better once they introduce first person combat, landing on 'planet sized planets' as Shawn Murray would put it,, multi crew ships and many, many other features that are planned. I have no doubt that the devs and the CEO fully intend to support the game and are capable of realizing this vision. You should note however that you have to buy each of these features individually, or get the 'lifetime expansion pass' (if it ever comes back on sale) for 195$, which gives you an idea of how expensive the game actually is/will be if you want the full experience. This makes me quite angry because for one I can't afford that, but also the main issue is I didn't know, and most consumers wouldn't have known either, that when the game came out for 60$ that you're only getting a very small part of the overall game when it's fully realized, and you need to purchase each expansion afterwards for 30$ or so. That's anti-consumer as ♥♥♥♥ IMO not to clearly state that you're only buying the bare bones foundation of the game! Still, as annoying as the idea of buying a game full price and not getting the full experience is, this isn't a typical expansion pass deal where you get a new map or something, you literally get a whole new game with entirely new gameplay mechanics! So I can understand the need to have people pay for each one to fund development. However, I don't know how they will handle having players like me who only bought the base game competing against players with all the expansions if they keep the single persistent universe, or if they will break it up like most games so only players with an expansion pack can compete with each other.   -Microtransactions:   Also, this is more of a minor thing for me because I don't play with other people so I don't care how my ship looks, but there are microtransactions in this game and if you want to customize your ship, add little bobble heads or otherwise make your ship yours, you have to spend an andditional 2.5-16$ for customization, and you have to buy things individually meaning if you want a paintjob for your sidewinder and cobra, you have to buy one for each, usually 4$ except for the worst ones which cost 2.5$. This hurts the game not just on principles of a 60$ game having microtransactions, but also because your character/ship is one of however many you can afford waiting in storage each time you die, and because the ship designs are already so bland and uninteresting that some customization is desperately needed to make you care in any way about your character and ship. The only thing that stings right now when I die is how expensive insurance can get, and how often/boring it is.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this game for someone like me who doesn't like always online and/or can't afford the expansion passes as it is repetitive, very grindy and shallow in the sense that you don't have that many ships and you can't do much other than shoot pirates and mine asteroids. It is however going to be a great game (I assume) IF you can get the expansions for it and get access to planets, FPS, larger/more interesting ships etc.",

It then doesn't surprise when it claims to have hundreds of millions of star systems, which is without meaning. It could have billions of galaxies with billions of star systems. It would not be of any improvement, which is characteristic for the hollow game design. There is no player intro, the tutorial is brief and one is supposed to have a joystick and a VR system for all of this on top.  Most of the gameplay takes part in a player's head. Looking at it with the cold truth is it a dead boring waste of time. It's like finding a stick in the woods and pretending it to be a sword. This is what Elite Dangerous is about. Or try to imagine yourself siting in a sandbox, litterally a box filled with sand, and to spend time building castles - then you know what the game is like. You couldn't get out of your mucky clothes fast enough and I couldn't get a refund for the game fast enough. Of course, some players find this game appealling, just like a toddler enjoys a nice, clean sandbox to let the imagination run wild.  Compared to the 30-year old Elite of the C64 has the gameplay not improved. Back then was it state-of-the-art of what was possible with the given hardware (1MHz CPU with 64k of RAM). All that has improved 30 years later are the graphics, but 30 years of advancement in gameplay and entertainment have passed without leaving so much as a trace.  People claim it would have a steep learning curve, but that's not true. The claim is part of their imagination. There is little to learn and it's merely an endless grind. There are far more complex space simulations such as EVE Online where one can spend years of playing and where one can still find new things to learn about the game and it's mechanic, with a high amount of diversity in game play, complex missions and an exciting player-driven economy. Although EVE Online is primairly a PvP game with a monthly subscription.  I don't recommend this game to anyone. Try Oolite under Linux, which is free and a clone of the original Elite with newer graphics, too. You'll get over the urge to try this game.",

Got this Thrustmaster t16000m joystick, haven't used a joystick for like 20 years (that's what she said) and when I go in to controls, I flip out at the amount of crap there is to set. I tried playing this with a mouse / keyboard and I just can't. Thought getting a well rated t16000m for this game, and my ship keeps going in reverse and when I try to fly around, the ship just rolls and takes forever to turn left / right. Tried Googling some keybindings for the t16000m to at least help me get started, but as usual, that never helped. I had a lot less problems getting used to playing console shooters with a controller. I seriously thought playing E:D with a joystick would be a blast, but it's more of a pain than the login problem I had at the start.",

It could have been a fantastic game if it wasn't ruined by FDEV's (Frontier Developments, the Publisher) incompetence at balancing, stopping combat logging, and listening to forumdad carebears who have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ they are talking about.  FDEV also seems to think that 'fun' involves doing incredibly mundane tasks over and over to grind credits, materials, etc. It's fun for about 5 hours and then it wears off. The grind is NOT worth it and is unbearably tedious (I sat through it). The game almost encourages you to take advantrage of clever manipulation of how the game functions in order to grind faster, such as refreshing mission boards by logging in and out, logging out while undocking to spawn 10km from a station to save time, etc.  The main problem is that FDEV focuses way to much on the aestetics and realism instead of focusing on how to actually make the game fun and interactive.  PvP has been ♥♥♥♥ed since 2.0 and will never improve due to the introduction of engineer mods which can increase the tankiness of shields by a factor of 10 (not to mention you need the horizons expansion to do it; P2W style). The game currently is incredibly shallow at the end-game. Player interaction is pointless because combat logging out of unfavorable situations is incredibly easy.  Speaking of player interactions, there is a solo play option right from the beginning, where you can only interact with NPCs. You can freely switch between solo and open play whenever you choose. However, playing in solo allows you to affect the galaxy for players playing in open and vice-versa. This means that people can oppose or undermine your faction and there is literally nothing you can do about it since they are in their own 'safe space'. Oh, by the way, this game uses P2P instancing when you are not in solo play, and the netcode is shoddy at best and simply does not work at worst.  However, all this being said ED is probably the best VR game currently on the market RIGHT NOW. If you own a VR device I recommend it. I also might recommend it if you enjoy games similar to Euro Truck Simulator.  &gt;25 Modular Terminals",

(you will slap yourself on the forehead after you do figure it out but its annoying that you have to do that by default instead of the other method) The default user interface makes you hold left shift, and then look at the actual menu that you are trying to use. If you, in a rage because you can't figure out how to pull up the comms for docking, don't do that its a bit trying on the nerves. Though all you have to do to fix that is go through the control menu and make it so it switches between the menus instead. Seriously its very annoying to do the other method by default. (yes I can understand the desire to do that for immersion sense, but for the casual gamer its annoying) I'm going to put this review as a no for recommendation for now, though I will change it if actual game-play is more fun than the arduous task of re-fitting the control scheme.",

Game play has become frustrating and is terribly biased to the NPC's.   Finding money sources are, mining, or various missions of combat, transport (data or materials) collecting goods. All require a lot of grind. Trade, is more hit and miss than the X-games and in them at least you had best buy and best sell software not here. In respect of delivery I have found and maybe this is part of the game's appeal to some players, you are asked to deliver to a ground base in a system that you have no astronomical data, hence you fly around and around looking for the planet the base is located on. I have found no way to improve this but I can say when you do get bored of that do not abandon the mission before docking and selling the cargo. You get finded for failure to deliver but at least you will not be additionally fined or shot down for carrying illegal cargo.  Did I tell you it is a great looking game, yes? Unfortunately, the planets I have landed on so far are a bit of a let down, mainly flat (no mountain ranges), monochromatic pot holed balls and the bases look like they are superimposed onto them.

Elite Dangerous is the most boring game I've ever played in my life. ED has been a shady game from the start. It scammed backers who were promised every DLC in the game only to forget about that promise and silence backers who noticed. The game at first seemed fun. It had a nice concept. A galaxy running on capitalism is a great concept. I never played the other ED games but I was interested enough to Google them and see the lore that ran the games universe. Thargoids, lifelike NPCs, multitudes of space stations. It all sounded great coming from games from the 80s and 90s. I was ready to play a game I thought would entertain me and my space fantasies for months to come. I got in my Sidewinder, did some missions, got my Adder, did some missions, got my Cobra, and did some missions. I then started to see a pattern. If you couldn't tell, I was doing missions over and over. Some of the info texts on the missions were copy pasted from ones I did before. It all felt synthetic. Fake. I suspended my disbelief for my own well being and talked to my friend who had introduced me to this game. He had a Type 6 transporter and said that he did trade routes selling slaves back and forth from Orang and Karid, getting 100k a pop. I worked my way into getting an Asp, and headed there. This is where I found one of the worst features of ED: manual travel. Sure it's fun for the first 20 or so jumps but then the cool noises and effects get boring. The game becomes a chore. When I made it to Orang I got myself some cargo holds and did back and forth runs for around 70k each. It was a lot of money for me at the time, but the process once again felt fake. If I did this in real life I wouldn't just look at a menu and select slaves. I would have to walk out and find a buyer. A real person who speaks to you and explains things to you. ED removes that and makes you click an arrow until you sell all your slaves. You leave the station, go to Orang and go do it again. Needless to say I got bored of that on the 3rd run so I decided to slap a nice FSD on my Asp and find a black hole. My lazy self decided to go look for the closest one instead of finding one because at this time I had lost hope for the game. When I made the last jump I had to use SC to travel a massive 150k light seconds to make it to the black hole. I spent at least 20 minutes trying to see if I could just hyper drive there to no avail, massive oversight by Frontier. I made it there and it was definetly what I expected. It felt like a real black hole. If I had a VR headset I would look at it for hours on end in awe. Then I ran out of fuel and had to blow up my ship. I tried bounty hunting, which became repetitive, pirating was impossible because I couldn't find anyone because of the stupid instancing system that makes the universe emptier than it already is. I had burnt ED out in 15 hours. That's unnaceptable for a game of this size. I looked up people with similar opinions and the shady practices of Frontier and found this: •You have to pay 60 bucks to buy the Horizons edition for content that should have been in the game from the start •Frontier removes negative content from their forums •Frontier adds microtransactions to their game and fanboys flock to it. •The Engineers update is a lottery for a chance to make a stat number on your ship go up. WOAH! Innovative!  Elite Dangerous is a slap in the face to Elite fans and gamers alike. They were asked to make this massive finale to their franchise with a connected galaxy that felt alive and real. What we got was a Point A to Point B simulator with less content than the arcade games, no motivation to play, a shady company, awful DLCs such as the 'see barren moons up close DLC' and the 'pay us to give you a chance to up yours stats DLC' It's a game with prententious devs and fans who believe that they are intellectually superior because they find their own motivation to play, despite the fact that a game needs motivation to even be a game. What a waste of my time and money.",

An obnoxious, money-grubbing graphics monster with unintuitive and uninformative menues and sliders (looking at you FOV) and don't get me started on the so-called newtonian physics and controls as compared to EL. Flies like a frigging WW2 Bomber in space and in my opinion has the worst mouse/keyboard controls of any space sim I have ever played. And if that sounds vitriolic, the game has its good aspects, too. The Graphics, sound and atmosphere are nice. I heard it flies fine with a joystick. I just always found the Elite designs to be rather bland and where were those aliens again? See what I mean? For every positive aspect.. Anyway.

While it's supposed to be a sandbox game, the only practical way I found to make money as a newb is to run missions.. so it's basically, do mission, cash in, repeat until eyes bleed.  I went to fight in a low intensity war zone and ate it immediately, so fighting didn't seem a good path for a newb.  I looked at trading, but starting cargo size was laughable. I'd die of old age before I made enough to get a bigger ship.   I tried mining and it almost made me snap. To mine or pickup dropped loot, you have to play something like the docking game except on a moving object. Wow!? that's how I spell fun!  It's like the developers sat down and asked, what are the most tedious things one can do in space? Let's build a game around that!!??  Game might be better once I've a better ship, but I'm not at all convinced of that given the experience so far. I don't really feel any compulsion to continue playing.

I travelled for many missions where i reach the station and it wont allow me to even send a docking request. Nothing shows up in the contact page so what a waste of time.  The graphics are good but i would rather recommend buying a space live desktop if you just want to look at live space as that is what you will end up doing.  The chat system is useless and it is very hard to communicate with the other players. It should have been like a world channel where people could quickly ask each other if they had issues. But that is not there on local channel where like me other noobs are just dealing with the bugs.  Also it gets really boring and lonely in the end and when u got nothing that you can figure out and no help you end up hitting exit and writing this review.  Some hard core fans of the series try to put down every negative review here but in the end they will pile up and this game will fail.

Frontier said they would add a lot to the game so I was optimistic, but what they added (Powerplay) is terrible, and now they're releasing a $45 expansion (Horizons) before even finishing the base game. If people buy it, they'll make us pay more for everything that should have been in the base game.  There's a lot of outrage over this, so Frontier *might* change their mind on the exhorbiant price, but they haven't even released a PR statement on the controversy so I don't have much hope.   I'm changing the review to negative, but I'll leave my initial review below for perspective.  *******************  Amazing dogfighting I like more than Star Citizen or any other space sim.   Relaxing trading and space trucking that I like more than Euro Truck sim 2.  Solid exploration if you just want to fly around and discover new solar systems no one else has ever laid eyes on before, and a galaxy so vast you can never hope to see every system to go along with it.  The UI is so polished that when you start the game it's actually fun just to switch to the menus.  Only downsides are that with the big galaxy comes the spreading of the player population. So if you explore distant systems, you likely won't see any other players. Luckily you can always go to the main hubs for human interaction if you so wish.   Another downside is the lack of human touch overall. You can't see your character or get out of your ship, you don't have conversations with NPCs (only Yes/No to a mission). You just don't see people or human faces really.   Last downsides are that I wish the economy was more in depth like X3 or Eve (that's asking a lot, though), and that the missions would last longer or be stringed together instead of Accept Mission - Complete Objective - Turn in Mission.  Overall I highly recommend it. I have enjoyed every minute I've spent with the game and plan to play much more. It's perfect for relaxing trade runs, or for exciting top-gun dogfighting.",

Looking back, I would have not bought this game. (I blame a friend who quit playing the game, lol) Great concept but I think they fell short on ways for me to keep playing.  About a week in. Already have a bigger ship and know how to keep a good flux of income in from bounties and contracts. Joystick or gamepad is really needed to control the ship accurately. I'm using a mouse and it is horrible but managable. It seems like a huge learning curve but really they have many detailed and easily understandable tutorials that I was able to pick up the basics of the game in a day. I highly recommend watching those videos prior to buying this $60 game.  The vast space to explore is awesome. I'm not a total fan of how you travel and it keeps me from really traveling far. Its already a grind to do some bounties. Its even more of a time dump to travel and you can't even set auto pilot if you plot a course. Traveling within a system is a pain at first but once you understand how to slow down and turn off FSD it gets easier but still leaves something less desired for.  The combat is fun. It requires much cordination and understanding your ships manuverbility. The ability for thrusters Forward, rear, and side allows for various ways to keep the guy in front of you as well as get behind the guy attacking you.  Ship Customization feels like a blend between MW:3 and EVE:O. They have read outs that tell you what changes making it fairly simple to understand if it is a good choice to upgrade.  The commodities market and economy left me baffled until I watched a youtube upload of how to find export and import of items on the galaxy map. After that, finding items is pretty easy for the most part (if you really like traveling and making little money off bartering).  I also believe this game is kinda dull solo play. Friends make this game a lot more hilarious and exciting. Also, with a bigger wing you can take on bigger ships for larger bounties. Don't buy this game unless you can join a group of people consistently.  Like one reviewer stated, This isn't an MMO. This isn't like EVE:O where you have several thousands of human pilots flying and chatting. This is more a single player game with CO-OP capabilities.",

(Really? - ok, at least include a default joystick model that includes a rotating z-axis.)  3) When you do finally get into a relatively decent ship, the AI on the server gets you ganked all the time for 'realistic excitement.' No real interactivity to repair another ship, or if those missions are in there, they're hidden quite well, I never seem to see an excape pod rescue mission at a station...  Horizons as a separate Beta and expansion is a bit lame.

The TL;DR version of that review is that, barring the addition of further content, Horizons cannot be recommended for purchase unless its on sale simply because I don't see the value present in the current version, and as of this review writing the addition of further content is delayed, probably because they need to make it less lame and underwhelming.

            "review_text": "Review updated as at June 30, 2016:  My Steam record states 20 hours of gameplay, but that's just on Steam. I usually play on my original pre-Steam external account where I have logged almost 1,000 hours in the game. I was an original kickstarter backer at a high level, an alpha tester, and I have lifetime access to all releases. Lifetime access is just about the only reason I've persevered with the game.  Now the review - in summary, Elite Dangerous is a terrific idea for a game, but it has significant issues.  The artwork is gloriously fantastic. The galaxy itself looks very convincing. Planets are realistic, starports and bases look great - in fact on the whole the game is just wonderful to look at. 9.5 / 10  The sound effects and music are very good. Immersive, not intrusive, atmospheric. 9.5 / 10  The flight mechanics and ship controls are well thought out (with one or two quibbles) and flying feels natural and immersive. Some of the best moments in this game are just flying your ship. Swooping past a station in space, landing on planet surfaces, and simply enjoying the experience. The default flight model is very much like atmospheric flight, but you can turn off the flight assist system and then it is full Newtonian, which is a lot harder to get used to but more realistic and gives great control in combat. 8.5 / 10  Combat is enjoyable and a good compromise between realistic and fun, although the AI has recently been made much harder. You get attacked by NPC pirates a lot, and although you can run away without too much difficulty most of the time, occasionally you just get swatted in no time flat. It can be frustrating and not much fun sometimes. 7 / 10  The user controls are flexible and all modes work well (controller, kbd+mouse, HOTAS) but control via a HOTAS is definitely the best way to play. TrackIR support is excellent, as is VR support. 8.5 / 10  The good parts are all the things that provide the framework for the game - the graphics, sound, control system, flight model, etc.  ... so what's bad?  Well, there are issues with just about everything else and the feeling that a lot is missing.  There is a frequently quoted cliche about this game that it is 'a mile wide and an inch deep'. Fanbois will tell you that it's 'all up to you' and that if it seems like a grind or empty of content then you have the wrong approach. This is a pretty lame excuse for the fact that the game IS shallow.  Far worse than lack of content is the lack of a point. The only goal in Elite Dangerous is to achieve 'Elite' rating in one or more of 4 possible categories, and to achieve rank with one or both of the superpowers in the galaxy (the Federation and the Empire). However doing this does not actually mean anything. It gives access to higher level missions and bigger ships etc, but there is no actual reason to want to do this. Players inevitably accumulate huge amounts of money and the only thing to spend it on is more ship/s. It's just pointless, endless, grindy acquisition that has no effect on the game.  Multiplayer gameplay is very poorly done and lacks some critical features: Instancing is sometimes unpredictable ; there is no in-game support for guilds or clans (some see this as a good thing) ; there is no open chat channel or group chat channel (comms is only person-to-person) ; crafting is grindy and random ; you can't build your own base or a group base ; you can't hire NPC wingmen ... the list goes on and on. None of these faults are actually game-breaking, but I often get the feeling that the developers, Frontier Developments, excel at making game assets but don't have the faintest idea how to use them to make a fun game.  I also often feel that they are obstinately opposed to including some features that are found in just about every other MMO. Elite Dangerous is based on the old solo games 'Elite' and 'Frontier' (also made by the same developers). There is a strong sense that Frontier Developments wanted to make an MMO, but also wanted to keep all the old solo gameplay features and not discriminate against solo players. Consequently they have left out all the things that support multiplayer activity. Incredibly stupid.  They also have a habit of releasing 'features' that no-one really wants, or of getting them badly wrong. The first major update (ie DLC) to appear, Powerplay, was a tactical and strategic struggle between major NPC factions. Players can join in by pledging support for one of these 'Powers' and carry out missions for them. It sounds good in theory, but in practice the way it works is so complex, grindy, uninteresting, prone to exploit and just plain badly designed that it saps any interest in taking part - so hardly anyone does anymore. The owner/manager of Frontier Developments, David Braben, has admitted in public that they got Powerplay wrong.  Frontier Developments has gained a reputation now among a lot of players for being almost 100% likely to get each new update wrong. They don't listen to players before they start designing the updates to find out what people actually want, and will only make tiny changes to each update after release. The most recent update 'Engineers' was once again a great idea but implemented in the worst way possible. They have already had to make a lot of changes to it based on complaints, and there are more changes to come, but as always, it won't be enough to fix an idea that is fundamentally wrong.  The playerbase is eroding all the time as people get tired of all these problems, which is a real shame as there is a fantastic game inside Elite Dangerous just screaming to get out, but the developers won't let it.  Would I recommend the game to a friend? Once I would have said yes, but to beware that they might find it both boring and frustrating. Now, in all honesty, I can only say 'NO'. The game just has not developed to fulfil it's potential, and it looks like it now never will.  I still log in occasionally but inevitably I grow weary of the game after about an hour because it all seems so pointless. Frontier Developments tries to keep things interesting by injecting hand-crafted community missions and posting messages on the 'Galnet' (the in-game news board) to make it seeem alive, but it all feels desperate and very contrived. Players, either individual or in large groups, have zero effect on the long-term situation in the galaxy, and nothing happens as a direct consequence of player action, apart from very short-term changes to a local economy or a change of government at a station, but in practice these things do exactly nothing.  On the whole - 5 / 10 as it stands, with the potential to be 10 / 10 if the developers could only rethink their design philosophy and instead of merely saying they are making a multiplayer online game actually get down to it and make one that has all the expected facilities to support multiplayer activity, and content that makes the game worth playing and gives players a purpose.",
