    "description": "Take out the Big Gun sounded simple enough, except the Strogg were waiting. You, and a few marines like you, are the lucky ones. You've made it down in one piece and are still able to contact the fleet. The Gravity Well, the Strogg's newest weapon in its arsenal against mankind, is operational.",

The game its self is good, but with those sentry in every corner it's nearly impossible to pass the game on Hard. Who needs bosses when you could just add 100  Sentry Turrets!!! ",

            "review_text": "Note: Game doesn't start correctly on Steam, have to set '+set game rogue' as launch option on Quake II or start .bat file in install directory, which is why I have no playtime.  To me, both this and Dissolution of Eternity are the worse mission packs of the bunch, respectively for each game. But Ground Zero is outright bad at times, unlike DoE. The uninspired level design and tedious encounters (particularly with the new enemies) make for a frustrating experience. When you enter a room and are immediately killed because you failed to account for two rocket turrets behind you while fighting off 3 gunners, it's hard not to feel cheated by the game. Ground Zero is unfairly difficult, and what I mean by that is that it isn't challenging in a fun way. DOOM and Quake are challenging in fun ways. You keep dying, but you keep loading that save again to get back in it. I can't say the same for Ground Zero.  I recommend that you play another game of the time period or replay Quake II, because Ground Zero is just monotonous. It's not bad. but it's also anything but fun.",
