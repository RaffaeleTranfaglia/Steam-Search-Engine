            "review_text": "As a big fan of Castlevania since Rondo of Blood, I was stoked that Konami is porting over Castlevania games to Steam, even though they aren't the stellar IGA-vanias like Order of Ecclesia and Symphony of the Night, but my fingers are crossed. Hopefully Konami shall at least grace Steam with Harmony of Despair if the sales do well.  Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate is a great blend of the classic Castlevania mixed with the later Metroidvania exploration, all wrapped in a solid combat system.  The Pros: - Great atmosphere -Great art and music -Combat is fluid and rewarding -The pacing is pretty good. -Character designs and animations are pretty damn awesome. -Doesn't have all the QTE's breaking up combat. There are a few, but not as many as on the DS version. -Alucard with a whip, need I say more?  The Cons: -Sometimes suffers brief slowdowns when entering a new area, even with a top-notch gaming rig. -Hit registration and enemy invicibility frames can be really random and wonky. -The various character's combat styles aren't very unique aside from spells and subweapons. -As in classic Castlevania style: Expect plenty of B.S. deaths, so your patience may be tried. -Blocking system is good but needs reworking, not enough reward for timing a perfect block. -The controls are awkward at first and take getting used to. It is strictly keyboard, and doesn't offer much customization.  Overall it is definitely worth a buy if you like 2.5D action platformers. The art is fantastic, and the combat has weight to it. Most of the flaws can be easily circumvented and the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Hopefully this isn't the last time Steam picks up another Castlevania.",

            "review_text": "I feel like this is a game that didn't really know what it wanted to be. It feels like they tried to import the attacks from the 3d games, but those don't lend themselves well to the 2d format, mostly making combat very long and tedious. Normally I enjoy Metroidvania type games a great deal, but in this case, they seem to have tried to port instant death falls into the format. In classic Castlevanias, this is fine, because you aren't looking for a great deal of vertical exploration and any fall should be considered deadly. Meanwhile in a Metroidvania where you're actually trying to look for unusual routes it becomes a punishment for exploration, as it does here. Again, tedious. Then of course, we get the Quicktime events. I will never understand why people feel the need to cram these into games, especially ones that trigger when I have an unavoidable traversal of a section that already slows movement. Boy howdy, mashing a button repeatedly to progress sure is fun to do over and over again.   Its not a terrible game, its just not terribly engaging and has enough flaws that I eventually just got bored and decided to move on, and I say this as a person who's beaten Castlevania 3 and got 102% in SOTN. All in all, its a shame because the artwork and soundtrack are beautiful, and they really did get the overall atmosphere spot on.",

The animations are off, specifically the jump animation. It feels slow and shiort, but it doesn't ruin the game. Combat isn't nearly as fluid as the other 2 games, but again it doesn't ruiin the game.  The story bridges the gap between the 1st and 2nd Lords of Shadows games, but it's not nessisary to play either first. So don't let that stop you. It's a soild game that's, so far, been worth the price. It's my 2nd favorite behind the first one.",

            "review_text": "Overall, this game is worth your time.  I've avoided the other Lords of Shadow games due to the slow, 3D God of War-esque combat. I originally avoided this one on 3DS because it was just so abysmal on such a low-res display.  Playing it in HD is far more impressive. the low polygon count and some textures obviously reflect its 3DS heritage, but overall the game looks pretty good. I did have some unexpected framerate problems in some spots, though.  The gameplay took some getting used to for me. I don't think it was until halfway or a third of the way through that I felt like the gameplay really clicked and I started understanding what I needed to do to fight enemies effectively. That, or the powers they give you just start becoming pretty good.  Compared to the Metroidvania games, *ALL* of the actions feel sluggish. Especially climbing and jumping. Overall the game feels a little clunky and slow, but the combat system is interesting, especially as you start unlocking more moves.  One thing that didn't sit right with me though is the music in this game. I generally love Castlevania music, and I barely even noticed the music in this game. It seemed like there wasn't any most of the time, and what little was there didn't add to the setting of the game. Some epic boss fight music or just eery castle-crawling music would've been nice.  Enemies also have a tendency to corner you in this game with no decent way to escape without taking damage, which is extremely frustrating.  Overall, an OK Metroid experience. The price tag and length make a lot of sense here.",

            "review_text": "The best aspects of the game are definitely the art assets and the visual style.  The story is fairly flat and simple, which is to be expected... The tone and atmosphere make up for this somewhat.  The game design is such that you spend too much time backtracking through a cumbersome very vertical layout with many loading screens.   Unfortunately I found the combat to be oddly clumsy. Your weapon doesn't feel like it has any weight to it and it takes often a half dozen to a dozen hits to kill simple enemies. Each enemy opponent can be dealt with almost in exactly the same way -- hit it until it retaliates and then vault backwards. This is especially true because of how frequently enemies throw unblockable attacks. The counter mechanic is basic and effective, but largely useless because of spammed unblockable attacks.  The boss battles are a saving grace, with real variety and difficulty. However, you will often be hit by huge hotboxes thrown out constantly. The gimmick I found the most irritating is lots of invincibility for the bosses, not only are you contending with their regular attacks and abilities being thrown out, but long moments of invulnerability where you basically engage in a mini game where your floaty character avoids giant hitboxes.   This game would heavily benefit from more polished combat and movement. Moving a tall, floaty character around wide slow projectiles and slow telegraphed attack patterns can often feel frustrating and unrewarding.",

            "review_text": "The Metroid Fusion of Castlevania games. If you are looking for a fully metroidvania experience, this is not it. However, this game does have metroidvania elements and is enough to scratch the itch if you've run out of other options.  The reason I say this game is like Metroid Fusion is because it is much more linear than other games in the series. You are given objectives on the map screen and your goal is to reach them. This is in contrast to other games where you are basically set free and must figure out where to go on your own. The game is more about exploration than combat. Your secondary goal, along with reaching the objective, is filling out the map and thus collecting power ups in the form of extra HP, magic, experience, and ammunition.   The game is paced well, split into 3 acts, each one with a different playable character. Each of the acts is then further split into 3 'sub-acts'. The first part involves starting out with the character and exploring while collecting powerups that let you access the next objective. The second part (usually signalled by finding a teleporter) involves using all of those powerups to backtrack and reach all the places that were previously inaccesible. The final part is basically just finishing up the final few objectives of the act.  Each character has the same basic combat abilities with the whip, but each differs in which sub-weapons they use and which magic abilities they have. Combat feels ok, not great. It's not the main focus of the game so it's not a huge deal. You have two main method of attack with the whip: horizontal strikes (more damage) and vertical strikes (cover more area). You can attack in the air as well, and you unlock new moves as you level up that can be performed with specific inputs. Most of them are useful in at least some situations. There is a good variety of moves and I never really felt like I didn't have enough tools to deal with any given combat situation, especially after you factor in sub-weapons and magic.   My problem with the combat is that the characters control a big too sluggishly for my tastes. The jump arc is slow and floaty, you are not free to pass through enemies with a dodge roll, and there is considerable ending lag on basically every move. This can make it hard to reach the end of your combos, especially against aggressive bosses, and it doesn't feel like you are reaching your full potential during these fights. In addition, some enemies are not stunned by your attacks, basically forcing you to stop so that you can dodge whatever they are going to throw at you. While this is not inherently bad, it makes you feel like your attacks have no impact. Some enemies like to hold their guard up, and while the game gives you a guard break move, it's extremely slow and short range. Most of the time the enemy has already dropped its guard and hit you by the time you get to run up to them and start your attack.  Overall I wish your character operated more quickly and had better movement options. However, combat is not the focus of the game and you will spend the majority of your time solving puzzles and trying to fiure out how to platform your way to the hidden areas. The level are well designed and you will pretty much always find something if you stray from the beaten path.   Overall a solid game. Nothing groundbreaking, but a satisfying experience. Not a true Metroidvania, but close. Game performs well, there are no glaring issues, and the level design is good. The game is fairly short though, probably 10-12 hours depending on how thorough you choose to be. Good game to get on sale, though if you really like Castlevania the full price isn't exorbitant for a game like this.  ",

The graphics are so sharp and crisp plus the controls are nicely set up, when you plug in a Xbox 360 controller. The game play to me reminds me of the old school Castlevania games for the 'Nintendo Game Boy Advance'. The main game that comes to mind on that handle held is 'Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow'. It goes back to the franchise’s 2D roots. Also It has almost the same lay out and boss battle system. The story for this game is like a fill in for 'Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2' cause it mostly talks about Gabriel son and his son's kid. The game is about 8-10hours long killing demons and lesbian vampires. I recommend this game to anyone really or likes old school 2D's plus a little twist of castlevnia into it.",

            "review_text": "First things first: if you haven't played Castlevania: Lords of Shadow yet, that should be your first stop. Mirror of Fate is a direct sequel, and the Lords of Shadow games reboot the Castlevania series with many of the same characters, at least in name.   Mirror of Fate HD is a strange game. The HD comes from it being a port of a handheld game, as Mirror of Fate came out on the Nintendo 3DS first. Let's get this out of the way: the game looks like a handheld port. That doesn't mean it looks particularly bad, but it's markedly low resolution and obviously uprezzed. The cutscenes kind of have a comic book look to them with some light cell shading in a modified in-game engine. I mean, it's not FMV or pre-rendered, but it's in-game assets that are touched up quite a bit.   As for the game itself, it's also kind of strange. It plays like Symphony of the Night except with the item management and combat ripped out and replaced with Lords of Shadow's combat mashed flat into a 2D plane. So that means that progress is gated by some abilities that are found within the levels. Experience points unlock different combos. Combat is often in an arena where you can't leave until everything is dead, and nothing dies in one hit. Combat is alternating direct and area attacks while blocking and rolling and switching between a couple of magic abilities and items. As is staple in most Castlevania games, health, magic, and item count increases are often hidden through out the levels. Taking another page out of Lords of Shadow, bits of game lore are also hidden in the dark corners of the levels.   But is it any good? Yeah, it's decent. I didn't have particularly high expectations going in, but it kind of brings back memories of older Castlevanias. Throughout the game, the plot follows three different characters, even if they all pretty much play the same way. My biggest complaints, beyond the obviousness of being a handheld port, are that the dialog is poorly written and performed, and to get 100% involves a lot of backtracking with a limited shortcut system. Some of the abilities that open up some of those minor upgrades don't appear until late in a character's chapter and then you're stuck backtracking through all the previous levels to get them, which sucks. Then combine the backtracking with more forced arena fights and there's very little incentive to get 100% unless you must have those three achievements. There's a special cutscene for getting 100% but you can always watch it on Youtube, which is what I recommend. It is absolutely not worth the effort to 100% the game just for that cutscene.",

The voice acting is decent and the game play well. Thats the best part its like playing a normal side scrolling Castlevania game. I have been stuck on DS titles such as portrait of ruin, dawn of sarrow and order of ecclesia (ecclesia is a total nightmare) and this was great to come to steam for the price. Its a good game so far. I have no complaints and I will wait till I have completed this title before either adding more to this review or completly trashing the game. As a huge fan of the franchise and play all titles except for judgement and the nintendo 64 game I am overwhelmed with joy to have been able to get this for 10 dollars. The DS verison used is still 20+ bucks HA. You start out as simon on a quest (pun intended) and are in search of anwsers, fueled by rage so far the game is a lovely addition to my steam library and castlevania titles alike. If your a fan of the games get this when you can afford to get it.

            "review_text": "Mirror of Fate Rating: 7/10 Overview: 2D Action/Platformer   The Good:   + The story takes place between Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 1 and 2 focusing on the adventures of Simon, Trevor and Alucard. Each character has their own light and dark spells.    + The combat is identical to Lords of Shadow, I really enjoyed the combat system so I felt really at ease getting use to the mechanics again.   + Collectables to upgrade your character providing incentive to backtrack through previously played levels   + Boss battles are fun and challenging. Boss designs are really well done.   + Boss rush mode allows you to fight every boss back to back.  + Soundtrack  The Average:  + The graphics do look like a 3DS port. The graphics are not bad but low polygons and low res textures hurt the overall look and aesthetic of the game.  + I found the platforming to be a bit 'floaty'. Jumping near a ledge would automatically place your character on it. It never feels as precise as it be.    Conclusion:  This game is not a typical metroidvania game. You play with three separate characters each with their own level layout and the majority of the level layout is linear. Backtracking is only necessary if you want all the collectables. IF you love 2D action platformers, this is a great game to pick up, it is not as polished as other games in the genre but if you can pick this up at discount then I think you will enjoy yourself. ",

It featured large open levels with lots of space for exploration, hardcore 2d action, memorable characters, cheesy-but-still-cool gothic atmosphere. That series is dead. There hasn't been a proper metroidvania in it for aeons. The game we are looking at now is Castlevania's dead, empty husk, an unholy mockery of once great series, rotten inside, yet still moving, animated by evli marketing wizardry. The game plays like an insult towards everyone who loves metroidvania. Yes, it does feature getting upgrades, backtracking and searching for secrets. However, the game is divided into three chapters, each one so small that it becomes a travesty. You don't look for secrets, you just get the available power-ups, then go back to collect the previously unreachable chests. Other than that parody of metroidvania backtracking, the game is linear, moving from level to level. The gameplay is basic and mindless: timed blocks and other feints are useless, you just button mash your enemies into oblivion. Puzzles are either rudmentary or tedious. Platforming parts are so easy they can be completed blindfolded. The story is an over-the-top fake-dramatic sausagefest: 'you killed my mother! Also, you're my father! Also, *I*'m *his* father! Also, you killed *his* mother! Also, NOOOOOOO'. Dialogues are written so badly that I don't even blame the voice actors for sounding like they are falling asleep reading them. Clearly, not a single person in the development team gave a bite about the game, so why should they? If you love what Castlevania used to be, avoid this soulless cash-grab. Play Ori and the Blind Fortest, Axiom Verge, Dust, Shantae, Cave Story... Or wait for Bloodstained to come out. Don't support this flogging of a dead horse. Castlevania isn't, and will never be what it used to be, let it rest in peace.",

Maybe this was an acceptable solution when the game was released on 3DS, due to the touch screen, but IT SUCKS having to do it with a controller.  ...making the game save every time you close the map, adding load times for no reason whatsoever.  ...adding a level system but not putting it to good use. From what I can tell, there are no stat increases and the only thing you can actually gain from levels are skills.  ...reusing the idiotic concept from Lords of Shadow, where you're interrupted by freshly spawned enemies halfway through pulling cranks.  ...making you take fall damage, meaning you can and will die from falling or making a drop from too high up.  ...sending you back to the start of the area if you die, effectively resetting your exploration of the map and making you have to do it all over again.

Most of what made the 2D exploration-based Castlevania's fun is here, as is a few gimmicks of its own. Rather than having 1 large and open world map you now have 3 smaller and less open ones, and rather than 1 character with a huge amount of varied skill, and maybe an unlockable one or two, you now have 3 character with somewhat less varied skills. So yes, this is a somewhat simplified Castelvania but it still scratches most of the right itch's and to its credit, there's a lot of good in here, fun, well-presented puzzle/boss setpieces, yep, a move set that starts out simple but really opens up as you play, yep, fantastic designs for the many monsters, yep, plus they don't let up on bringing in new ones. I'm not gonna call it a platformer due to the lack of difficult platforming, well mostly, there are a few parts here and there, and some of them make up the most broken parts of the game, not hard, broken, like having to jump onto a moving platform that you can't see because the screen doesn't show it till your falling, this sort of issue popped up a few times and caused more deaths than most of the monsters combined and is easily the games biggest issue, but, overall this is a solid 2D action adventure game that should entertain.",
