How about a 'Jigsaw Puzzle', one of the oldest toys created? This game is pretty much all of those things put together. I personally only played this game while listening to podcasts, which worked out really well, but I couldn't tell you how it stands on it's own. All of those things I mentioned aren't exactly well known for being the pinnacle of entertainment, but they are good time wasters. Buy it in a pack or on sale.",
