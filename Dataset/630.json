The official campain is great fun and you can play it over and over again, trying different ways to beat it. Join ASB, Riflemod or chickenscoop servers to have even more variation in Alienswarm.  Sadly, this game does not have a workshop. That means you have to manually install map packs when you want to play other maps than the default 7.  To get most of the game with additional settings, pvp modes, 8 player coop, new weapons, challanges and pre installed maps get Reactive Drop. Though make sure to join the official RD-group for scheduled events.",

Each class has two characters with different stats for one or more of the following: aim, ammo, reload speed, special abilities speed and others. It's a great short game, also it's free! It takes about 1-2h to finish, there are quite a few difficulty modes and other settings that add a lot of replay value to the game, such as friendly fire dealing more or less damage, and onslaught mode, which brings a high variety of enemies to the beginning of the game to make things more interesting.

It's well thought of, dynamic, stable, and challenging. You have to actually coordinate with the team, pre select the gear, get good with the class you use, etc.  'Watch where you are shooting, shitbag' is the most common phrase you gonna hear in the voice chat. Because when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, everybody panics and shoots and pray. And you can shoot with a good variety of guns, and inventories are not over colmplicated.  Cons: mmhhh, the game starts right up, in a slow pace, but some mechanics are not explained at all, and in the middle of the chaos you can get confused at first with what the hell your self healing pack does, or your welder... but that's old school and cool at the same time. Not really a con.  If I may, there's only one real con:  TOO SHORT, and no steamworkshop... what the hell?  I could play this for years with no problem, dammit steam!",

            "review_text": "In a gist, it's a fun top down action game that eschews stats and loots for a more tactical and visceral experience. The core of the game is planning your route through the campaign and mowing down hordes and hordes of aliens as you and your friends are barely hanging on to life. Sweet.  Some things in Alien Swarm that I would love to see in other games of this genre: - Shared map where you can all plan your route.   - Minimal loot, minimal stats, focus is on loadouts and interesting effects (freezing, burning, electricity etc.). Going through loot is tedious when all you are doing is increasing DPS.  - That climatic end. Believe me, if you don't spoil yourself by playing on a lower difficulty, the finale is worth the wait.  - The tactical nature of the game. The game gives you a lot of tools and weapons. Bar the door, and the alien has to spend time smashing through it. Lay a wall of fire and watch the hordes melt before your eyes. But all the defenses are temporary, and the aliens can and will overpower/overrun them. You and your friends have to plan properly to use your limited resources for victory. Some of my favorite moments in this game is defending a point while hordes and hordes of aliens stream in from everywhere. All the defenses and traps we laid are exhausted but we do manage to pull through.  On top of that, with friendly fire on, you really have to plan things out so you don't end up shooting each other. You even lose ammo if you reload early! That's a feature that's missing on a lot of games.   There are some cool things in this game borrowed from third person shooters, like crouching (for cover) and calculating line of sight so you don't hit obstacles/the floor/the wall. Definitely makes the game feel more 'grounded' and adds to the tactical layer, although I honestly don't remember if I ever used crouch.  Get some friends, play on brutal (yes, from the beginning), and have fun.",

In later stages (tougher difficulties) you'll acknowledge that you can't be like Rambo, killing all swarms by our own weapons, skills and tactics. I repeat, it's a MULTIplayer co-op game, where you can maximize your effectivness and joy playing it by being in a good, strong group of skilled marines (players).

            "review_text": "If someone understand the game...  ... it wouldn't be me. I mean, the plotline is just Starship Troopers without the big army and the corporation hiding the truth. But anyway, it seems that the Swarms is a hate story with mankind when reading the biography of the characters.  Anyway, you're just arriving a mining colony not answering calls, you already know that there was a problem, else you wouldn't be here and you have to get through to understand how they got swarmed by the aliens. You're beginning in the landing bay to finish into Timor Station, with a baby nuke bomb to escort. You're passing by the surface, by the reactor room or the residential area with labs locked down without forgetting your little trip in the sewer and the famous cargo elevator scene where everyone is shocked by a famous lag that is just in reality a slow motion scene.  The plot isn't really evolved by the PDA, seeing how short are the levels and the time you don't have to read them. So if at first glance, I was pleased by the turn of the events in-game, the lack of information prior the incident is just being making something amiss. I'm perhaps too used to Doom 3, Max Payne, FEAR or Legendary where you get a lot of clues about what's happening or how you got into the nightmare.  So the gameplay isn't intuitive at first: you'll have a time to adjust to that. If moving is just being the hardest part, the rest is really simple (not if you're not knowing all the keys): you just shoot swarms, you heal people if you're medic, you hack computers if you're tech.  Because you can choose between eight characters, two by classes, with special weapons. Everyone is unlocking the same weapons but not every class can use them. I'm explaining: the Officer is typically your common character you're meeting in the game: not heavily armed, without real speciality. The Specialist is the Heavy Weapon guy, carrying heavy miniguns. The Medic is the doctor you're going for if you're wounded, only him can carry enough health for everyone. The Tech is just your hacker, he's the only that can break into computers or some locked doors. If the Tech is really needed, having him dead is making the mission restart.  You have to earn XP for leveling up and getting unlocks. Everything is determined at the end of the mission, with the stats of it, if you earn achievements (or if you repeat them - for example, you already have the one with healing an infected marine but you can still earn XP for it if you keep healing people with parasites) or with the difficulty of the mission.  Alien Swarm isn't really the game with magnificent tracks, apart the sounds from the Swarms, the voices for the Marines or the music track indicating that you're gonna be swarmed or under adrenaline effect, you have nothing. No music menu, no music in the lobby leader, just random sounds. It's maybe a free game but it could have been given some good music. After all, play a game from Ben Crosshaw or Grundislav Games and you have always a serious soundtrack.  I must say that for a free game, the graphics are good, without real graphic glitches. As you're seeing all from top down, you need to recognize the Marines: white is for Medics, yellow for the Techs, green for the Officers, Blue for the Special Weapons and each of them has a different design, so, it's really easy to recognize them. The enemies are also well done, as the levels. The only little negative point are the bodies around the base, that are looking like nothing. Apart that, each level is adapted to his name, so, you're in a residential area (with labs near), you'll find offices but also a gaming room, sleeping rooms, bathrooms, etc.. If you're in the sewers, you'll be walking in water for example.  In other words, Alien Swarm, despite my initial reluctance to play it (it's not a FPS, I was just getting the hat), managed to chase my fears, to surprise me and to make me love it, even if it will never be the same love I'm carrying for my FPS games. So, I recommend it to any people searching for a good co-op game.",

And after you've completed it once, there isn't much else to do that re-doing it on a harder difficulty. There are some people out there who have made a couple of custom maps long ago, but the community in general died out. The lack of Workshop doesn't help either. All we can hope for now is that Valve revives the game with new campaigns or makes a sequel.  In short: One of the best Co-op games out there and it's free.

These 4 then had a big gang ♥♥♥♥ and had like 37 children or something.The 37 children go missing, and the remaining 4 dont give a ♥♥♥♥ because they costed too much money anyway and couldnt be arsed sharing food with little ♥♥♥♥♥ that just run around throwing ♥♥♥♥ at them. Untill one thing triggers their anger, their pet tortoise has been stolen. This is an epic journey through time and space in which these dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ go to find their tortoise, will they do it? I dont ♥♥♥♥ing know I never played this game I was just payed to give it a good review",

Tip the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt to one side, yeast into the other. Add the butter and 3/4ths of the water, then turn the mixture with the fingers of one hand. Add the remaining water a little at a time, continuing to mix untill all the flour is taken in and the dough is soft and sticky; you may not need all the water.  2. Coat the work surface with a little oil to prevent the dough sticking. Turn out the dough and knead for at least 5 mins, until smooth and no longer sticky. Lightly oil a bowl, return the dough to it, and cover with cling film. Put in fride for an hour, so it has doubled in size.  3. Line a baking tray with grease-proof paper. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and fold it inwards again and again until all the air is knocked out and it is smooth. Add the stilton, walnut and pear peices to the dough and work them in well.  4. Shape the dough into a rectangle 30 cm long, roll it up into a sausage, then flatten it out again and roll it up a bit tighter this time. Tuck the edges under and neaten the loaf by rolling the edges to taper them slightly. Put the dogh on the baking tray with greaseproof paperwith the join underneath. Place the tray in a plastic bag and leave to prove for about 40 mins, until the loaf has doubled in size. Heat the oven too 200C, or Gas 6.  5. Just before baking, gently rub flour over the loaf, then make deep diagonal cuts alo9ng the top, first in one direction, then the other, to make a criss-cross pattern. Bake for about 30 mins, until well-risen and golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.",

It's class-based with only two of each class, but you find that only one is actually essential to level completion. Unlike many games by Valve, you don't really give a damn about the characters you play as. The only difference is avatar and voice. No biggies, really.  However, to fully enjoy this game, PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS. OPEN SKYPE. DO THAT. I say this for many multiplayer campaign shooters, you may come across someone who will make you hate the game because they're telling you what to do, and not in the sense that they're actually being a leader. If you're with friends, you know your strengths, know how to communicate and know how to get stuff done.

(There are 8 characters of two each classes). In this game, it's all about cooperation, there are no bots, which kinda sucks but you need good teamwork to play the game. (I can't be bothered anymore lmao)",

The weapons sounds are ok, but I found a custom sound add-on that is better in my opinion. Great team play when you get a good team that cooperates with eachother. The only downside is that hardly anyone plays it, so often there will be no online games available, which means that you probably will play with people who are new to the game or aren't that good at it yet. One of the best things you can figure out is that the best way to pass some of these boards is to move as fast as possible or keep moving, since there is no limit for aliens spawning. Usually, the harder the difficulty, the faster you need to go. I've beaten the Jacobs campaign on Brutal onslaught difficulty and to do that you have to know the boards like the back of your hand, have lightning reflexes with god-like accuracy as does your team. There are many map campaign add-ons available to download off of the internet, and I'd say %50 of them are really good, although hardly anyone knows about them. I think I have about 6 or 7 add-on campaigns that are really fun, but again, not very many people know about it. If I remember right, this game uses the same engine as the half life 2 games, so I think it would be cool to have some tougher puzzles to figure out, and it would be cool if for one of them you switched to 1st person view to be better able to figure out the puzzle. I don't really understand why Valve doesn't work on this game to fullfill it's potential. The option to put in bot(s) would be nice in online multiplayer, you can do it by typing the comands in the console, but that can be tedious after a while, and not to mention the bots freeze when they see one of those big spitters that lob 3 delayed explosives on the ground. All that said, Great game, never played a top down shooter with gameplay as smooth as A.S.. Not to mention the top down shooter genre is kind of dead...So Play A.S.!",

It barely works oin my computer and yet my friends and I can't stop playing it. There is nothing like fighting off swarms of aliens with your friends on Skype listening as you get seperated and your medic gets torn to shreds. But the mission comes first as the tech/engineer marine still has to be escorted to the bomb. That heartbreking moment when the badass, minigun toting, and cigar smoking heavy weapons experts yells 'Go on without me!' and runs into and alien swarm cursing and spraying his minigun/flamethrowe/chainsaw. Yes, you read that correctly you can get a chainsaw. Also, you can get a sentry gun. They take time to set up but a sentry gun can easily turn the tide of a battle. Need I say more? Okay, the only thing this game is really missing (for now) is new content. The campaign is short but brutal, depending on the difficulty. There are levels in the game, however having a max level (25) marine on your team doesn't help that much. Sure they get access to better equipment, but a good trigger finger and a keen eye will help far more. After all you do get a sentry turret at level one and, excluding the chainsaw, might be the most overpowered weapon in the game. Ammo is also incredibly scarce throughout levels so bring along friends, they can give some extra firepower when needed or when friendly-fire is enabled you can take for the cost of a few bullets and one meat shield.",

The game was based on the old flash game alien shooter where you control a marine on a third-person view above the head. It is a welcome break if your eyes is tired from playing too much FPS which is what most Source SDK are made of. The leveling system is not very hard too, no more thinking of where to spend points as this one only unlocks new equipment instead of earning stat or skill points. All in all, its just dive in and have fun!   The game makes heavy use of team play and class requirements based on mission objective, so your team can't just be picking their favorite marine and just shoot shoot shoot, it needs team work. Some mission requires heavy use of medic, most requires heavy use of tech.  One down side I guess is the lack of single player mode/mission/map to get you acquainted with the game, but that's probably not all bad since there are a lot of players who are nice enough to carry you.

Has some neat guns and sentries but it requires you to reach a certain level to to unlock it. Um.... it has a ranking system which is more playtime if you want to reach max level. It's a good game like a said, not much content but you can download maps for more content i guess. Yeah, try out the game.",

Alien swarm is the perfect litmus test for your co-op partners' gaming skill, computer hardware, communication aptness, and so much more.

Do I recommend this game to solo? A big NO. Get 3 friends and enjoy the game.   This game consists of only 1 campaign, a total of 7 missions/levels. It's a 4 player squad tactical co-op where you have a top view of your characters and using WASD to move and your mouse to shoot at targets. Though it is a rather very easy game on....easy difficulty, on normal and higher difficulties you require coordination with your teammates and even set up a team if needed. The fun, at least in my opinion, comes from attempting the speedrun achievements. The time spent in learning how to finish the mission in time without any of your buddies dying as well as keeping it within the time limit is fun. It's like learning how to fight a new boss properly with a party in your typical mmorpgs.   As said before, it is a forgotten game that does not receive anymore updates. But like it or not, it is still worth your time to try the challenge with your friends. I promise you will not be disappointed if you guys love learning ways to overcome difficult challenges.",
