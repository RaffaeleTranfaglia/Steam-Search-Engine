            "review_text": "Ive played Man of Prey, another game much like this, which I rate highly, so I really wanted to like this game, but unfortately I felt a little let down.  The tutorial is passible, it however isnt very helpful, and not particularly clear to the casual gamer on how it works. I had a few thick moments with it where the game is constantly asking me to hip fire, and i'm wondering why I cant do it. My character was crouched....duh!  There's a lot of be had in this and it does feel very much like an unpolished Jagged Alliance, with a lot more NPC interaction and side missions. The combat is a learning curve, and on a strong computer you can feel liek you're a little all over the place if you dont reduce mouse sensitivity.  I am willing to give this some more time and I would love to be proven wrong. I however spent my first 1.5 hours trying to get through the first tutorial, and then complete the first area. For the casual gamer, you may feel like banging your head against your desk after an hour of this. For the RTS/RPG dedicated people, there is possibly a great deal of delayed gratification available to you later when you have an established squad. I however didnt have the patience for this.",
