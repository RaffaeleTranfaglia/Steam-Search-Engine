            "review_text": "Pretty bland. uses alot of stock RPG maker parts, a generic 'silent protagonist' to save time, and you know. lack of writing skills.  actual in game dialogue is like 50 total lines. actul story dosent exist. hits you with the egeneric 'main character is the cause of this' literally immediately after talking about a 'heart of the castle' or whatever.  has some specially drawn scenes, like 3 or 4 of them. but they ALL look terrible. my favorite is how the final boss gets his own little intro image. and it looks absolutely nothing like his in game sprite.  literally copies the main castle map from The Fairy, The Succubus, and The Abyss. dosent even TRY to rearange it any.  gameplay is okay, but to grind monsters(which youll never need to do since every enemy can be killed in at most, 2 hits. final boss included.) you have to leave the dugeon and return. game has no balance whatsoever, as soon asyou get tripple triad or whatever the hell its called, its GG. you win.  its an okay rpg maker generic low effort game. for free. ITS NOT WORTH PAYING FOR. THIS ISNT EVEN UP TO LAXIUS POWER STANDARDS.",

It's a fairly easy RPG, a slightly unique battle system that's pretty smooth, the characters have a good relationship even though the main character, Celesta doesn't speak.  I recommend it to those who enjoy the casual RPG.",
