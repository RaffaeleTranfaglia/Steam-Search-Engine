The effects and graphics are terrible, it has nonresponsive, horrible controls (I used an xbox 360 controller), ridiculously long loading times(think early ps1), annoying music, and 4 resolution settings with 1080p not included. Fix the darn buggy mess, then maybe I'll try playing again.  ",

This game must not be laptop friendly..... or doesn't like mine at least, for some reason. Here, check this  thread  out, I posted on there and never heard back.....from the devs or anyone else with a similar probem like me....yes, I actually patiently waited for a reply thinking maybe, ok I'll give them some time to get back to me, perhaps they're busy now and might reply back in at most a week's time, four months later - no replies; so either the devs are too busy to bother helping me out or this was just cash grab and nothing more...  Waste of my time and money....why did I even bother with this piece of crap.....",
