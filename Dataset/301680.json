    "description": "Set in futuristic environment, two races of mechanized alien species wage air-warfare over Earth-like pieces of land. Each ship has a coloured shield that protects the player from bullets that are the same colour. Enemy ships are also colour coded, making them more vulnerable to the same coloured bullets the player is firing.",

            "review_text": "There is not much fancy stuff about this game, but it is more of positive then negative. Visual part is mostly fine, apart from projectiles(they seem overly bright and contrasty). Sound is ok, but it appears to live a seprate life from the game. Gameplay tries to mimic classic shmups and absolutely lacks innovations. Some may regard it a plus though. The levels lack ground targets. Separate word should be given to the difficulty. Difficulty setting does not seem to affect anything, but the shield capacity, so the easiest setting will be a hell for a player who is not good with this type of games. Concluding, i would say that the game left more or less positve impression and i can recommend it to all fans of shmups.",

I recommend this game to gypsy farmers who work on a loney Sunday morning when others are out playing sunday league, this game is the epitome of the EA servers and Rich Homie Quan attempting to speak english. First of all the graphic are as useful as a homless guy to big business law firm, the gameplay looks as if it was made in 1920 and the title screen is able to give anyone a sezure.      BTW i only played 5 mins.",

You can move, you can shoot, then you can move faster, and shoot wilder. That brings me those nostalgic days with 'Insert a coin' screens. broken fingers of hard buttonpushing, sigarette by sigarette by losing and pretty much screaming with happy tears in the eyes by winning. Also I like to play co-op cause you can always blame your partner in all the world disasters. So be it. Find your time amongst all your leveling up, mob-killing, head shooting, zerg gathering or gold farmimg, take a sit in your favourite rocking chair and enjoy it.",
