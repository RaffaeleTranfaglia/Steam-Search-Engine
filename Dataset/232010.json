            "review_text": "I really enjoy this game, even though people may think it's boring to keep driving back and fourth to different cities to only drop off cargoes in order to gain more money. Although there is less cities to drive to, I still enjoy it. I love the feeling to be able to drive properly, and have played 20 hours within 2 days due to being obsessed. I'm not saying the game is perfect, hell, the second game might not even be perfect (can't buy it since I have a Mac) however it still is fun.   I am quite big on graphics, and I have to admit this isn't so bad. The trucks/cars both look great and so does the interior of the trucks. You can either drive on manual or automatic which adds realism, and so does the various types of weather, time, and the rules of the road. Sound doesn't seem to be much of a problem, it has realistic car, weather, truck and engine noises.  Having to deliver more and more in order to gain more money, does take a lot of time. But this leads to the game being more addictive and actually worth it. However, if driving back and forth for a while isn't really your thing, this can become a problem, though I ensure it wont be when you actually try it out, and even better, unlock more places.   One thing that has annoyed me while driving around on here is how stupid the other drivers are. They either go the wrong way, beep at me when I am not doing anything wrong, and/or randomly brake when there was no need to which leads me into hitting them, which leads to me having to pay for hitting them. Adding pedestrians or animals would also be something which would make the game better (no I do not want to run them over)  Another thing is how the cities are extremely small, and only have up to 5-6 roads, which is bad for when you want to explore other places other than the highway. The sound is good, but not so great. It sounds like I'm driving ontop of the truck rather than inside (might be because the windows are always open for some reason) and the radio does not sound like it's actually coming out of a radio in the truck.   Honestly, I love this game even though it has some flaws which I have to live with, however those are probably fixed in ETS2. I recommend this game if you either have a older computer, have a Mac and cannot buy the second one (which is my case) or have a few cash left or is low on cash to spend it on this. An overall 6/10 from me.",
