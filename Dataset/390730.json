            "review_text": "Plays pretty similar to its predecessor, Suguri, being that you move horizontally and use your dash to phase through energy based attacks, while shooting enemies. So gameplay wise, if you enjoyed Suguri you'll definitely like Sora, especially with the latter's refinements over the original. For example, dash spamming has been nerfed in general--initiating a dash will boost your Heat by about 30%, thus making it more risky to turn on a dime. You also gain Heat from attack cancelling, making that riskier as well. The difficulty curve also feels less abrupt than in Suguri (I still have PTSD from that Kae fight), and scales more linearly. Furthermore, the weapons have been rebalanced making most of the worse weapons from Suguri more viable.  In terms of length, it took me around 9 hours or so to beat story mode (stages 1-7) on easy, so there's quite a bit of content, along with the fantastic OST. Even if you're not so good at these games like I am, you should be able to progress atleast on easy.",

            "review_text": "I honestly never would have thought this game would come to steam.  This game, Sora, is the sequel to the game Suguri, which was published by Rockin' Android. You are Sora, an enhanced, basically mechanized superhuman fighting in a neverending war that seems to encompass all of Earth, and your goal is to make people stop fighting... by shooting rockets into their faces. Nobody said peacekeeping was easy!  Anyway, this is actually the second time the game has been localized. The first time was done by--I guess you can call them a person--called OmegaTH, who, bluntly speaking, screwed the pooch in localizing it. Horrific translations, Pointless name changes, terrible bugs, missing music I believe, game breaking DRM, the improper use of the word 'Reploid' were just a few of the things that you could have expected from that localization.   It seemed the game was doomed to be stuck in a kind of limbo where it was basically as good as never released in the US.   At least until Fruitbat factory came outta nowhere and decided through the darkest of magic rituals to obtain the license to the game and give it the release it deserved.  The game has none of the aforementioned problems of the previous localization, integrates with the steam overlay without any flaws, seems to control flawlessly (I've read it 'feels' off compared to the Japanese version, though I cannot confirm that), and just exudes a lot of the love and care put into it to make it a fine release. The only minor flaw I could think of is some slowdown during the more intense bossfights, though there are options to remove blur effects and the likes to mitigate it. Aside from that the game is as good as it can get.  They did the impossible  saw the invisible  and should have the highest praise from everyone for just going where I would figure no one else would try to do.   Anyway, it's an awesome game that anyone who is a fan of great shmups, good video game music, or just anyone looking for a fun challenge, should pick up.",

            "review_text": "*LE GASP* How could I have reviewed Suguri but not Sora!? Blasphemy!?  Anyways... Sora, like Suguri, is a bullet hell style shoot 'em up with unique mechanics. We follow our protagonist Sora, a war machine created solely to end said war, fighting back against those who choose to disturb the peace and continue fighting, meeting some familiar faces along the way. The game consists of 7 regular stages and a bonus stage, which may seem small but more than makes up for it in both the difficulty and replayability value.  Sora is in no way as hard as Suguri, however there were some fairly major tweaks in the gameplay to stop the more cheesy strats, such as adding heat penalties for constantly dashing to turn sharply and cancelling delays after shooting. This said, however, the game can be very challenging to those who seek such a challenge with the hard and special difficulties, as well as having a moderate challenge for those like myself who were apparently just never given those bullet hell genes.   The game in general runs smoothly with fairly little lag even on awful laptops such as mine, and the animations are very fluid. The game looks beautiful when we get half a second to look at it, and each little area seems unique, from a snowy alpine region to a barren desert to a gloomy city, never seeming bland or unimaginative to me in the least. The character designs are also very interesting to me, genuinely making me want to get to know these characters more and what caused them to do the things they did.  The game also has it's own little way of teaching you the game mechanics without really teaching you at all. The bosses seem to serve as tutorials, forcing you to get to grips with a certain mechanic and punishing hard if you fail to do so. For example in the first boss battle, the boss uses many fast energy based attacks to force you to learn dashing, whilst the second teaches you how to deal with projectiles that cannot be dashed through and melee attacks. I always find it charming when games like this don't just pop up a little text box, and instead teach you the mechanics through many many tears fighting that one boss over and over until you finally get it... Gotta love it...  The gameplay itself is extremely intuitive, as someone who didn't own a controller for a while, I managed to beat the whole game with keyboard. There aren't a whole lot of buttons to have to learn, there's no having to press 15 buttons at the same time to pull off a super secret special mega ultra attack, just a select few, and that's really all the game needs. The game forces you to make quick decisions but instead of forcing you to fit in a tiny gap between bullets, there are several ways to dodge attacks or beat a boss. The starting weapons are actually pretty good in my opinion, the game doesn't force you to grind in order to get better weapons, instead encourages you to try with what you have, and if that doesn't work, well tough, you just need to get better. By the end of the game, you'll probably have unlocked the majority if not all of the weapons, so it's nice to just go back, play through the stages again and wonder 'what if I used this', or 'what if I did this differently', making the game very enjoyable to play through again.  And if, after playing the game through once, you're thinking 'IF I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT STUPID STAGE 3 MINIBOSS ONE MORE TIME TABLES WILL BE FLIPPED', well you're in luck. The boss battle mode makes for a nice, stressful time, especially on special difficulty, but it's definitely nice to not have to do the whole stage again just to practice the end boss if you're trying on a higher difficulty.  But I mean one good thing in playing the stages over and over and dying over and over is being able to experience the amazing soundtrack Sora has to offer. Honestly in my first playthrough I was too stressed to pay attention, it took a friend pointing out certain tracks for me to realise how wonderful they were, and oh my are they wonderful. After buying the soundtrack I honestly can't name a single track I dislike, even the main menu theme... And that's saying something after you've finished one of the two songs with lyrincs in them, both of which are a nice touch, and not grating as I understand lyrical tracks can be sometimes in games. Honestly I'd buy this game just to listen to the soundtrack, it's just that wonderful.  In conclusion, Sora is a wonderful addition to the bullet hell genre, subverting the norm of 'just shoot and try to fit yourself into these tiny gaps' and improving very much over the original, Suguri, which is also a great game in it's own right. With a great atmosphere, great graphics and a much greater soundtrack, Sora has probably become my favourite bullet hell I've ever played, having probably the 3rd or 4th spot in my favourite OSTs list. I'd recommend buying this dut to all these reasons, and it being fairly cheap certainly helps.",

            "review_text": "Star Breaker Did Nothing Wrong.  In all seriousness, the gameplay is very smooth and refined compared to its predecessor, Suguri, consisting of a horizontal shooter where you have to time your shots instead of shooting constantly and where certain bullets can be 'dashed' through harmlessly while others will hit you regardless of if you're dashing or not.  The soundtrack is very good, consisting of electronic trance songs that definitely help with immersion. The characters in the game are loveable and have a lot of effort put into them for a bullet hell shooter, and the story can be quite emotional as well. The localisation is on-point and adds a lot of new features, such as the ability to go widescreen without breaking the game. Definitely a lot better than the first localisation…  All in all, one of the best bullet hell shooters of all time, and certainly a unique one compared to Touhou-like shooters. And again, Star Breaker Did Nothing Wrong.",

            "review_text": "I played this before Steam happened, and after I learned of Suguri.  This is a very good shooter game with a lighter difficulty than Suguri due to more weapons, slower pace, less solid projectiles, and the fact you are absolutely the ultimate weapon.  This doesn't mean it's easy, though: If you're bad, you probably won't even reach the main menu. Even if you don't get stuck, have fun at level two. You get a variety of weapons through 8 stages in order to stop the war as Sora, a perfect cyborg who is trying on their own to stop the war from destroying absolutely everything. Your tools at the beginning are shields, a bazooka, a beam rifle, and the ability to dash through energy projectiles to charge your hyper gauge for an overpowered attack to combat against some of the crazy barrages the enemies throw at you. Overall, Sora is a solid successor to Suguri, which enjoyed only a small following before it hit Steam under a (rather poor) rival publisher, and may or may not be accompanied by an excellent fighting game.  I have to give this thumbs up for obvious reasons.",

            "review_text": "Sora is an amazing, fast paced, challenging, shoot 'em up where you play as a girl named Sora (Japanese for 'Sky') who was born as the ultimate weapon to fight in a war.   Let me just skip to the end here and say: Sora is a great game and despite everything I say about it, it is most certainly worth your time, so check it out!  Plot: ******   Sora was born as the ultimate weapon to fight in a war that had been going on for ages. After her first battle in the gloomy, grey sky she glimpses the beautiful blue sky through the clouds before losing consciousness. When she wakes a man tells her of his dream to 'clean up the sky' and make the planet a beautiful place to live again. The memory of what Sora saw beyond the grey hued clouds moves her heart and she asks if there is any way she can help. After that she fights a war of protection to defend those who wish to put an end to the war and save the planet from 'dying'.     Gameplay: ************ Sora is a fast paced bullet hell, shoot 'em up and at times can be quite challenging. Sometimes the screen is so filled with projectiles it can be hard to tell where you actually are and where enemies are (especially on higher difficulties). The weapon system is quite good: Beam weapons can be passed through by dashing to charge the hyper gauge and recover health, while 'Live-Ammo' projectiles cannot be dashed through, but tend to move slower and do more damage. The dash is also worked into gameplay quite well, allowing quick maneuvers to deal damage without taking to much yourself.  Pros vs. Cons: **************** Pros: - Very fun, but still challenging gameplay. - Amazing story and characters (They will stay with you long after you finish the game). - Huge variety of weapons and weapon combinations. - Incredible Soundtrack. - Different playable modes such as arcade mode (All levels back to back) and match mode (Boss Rush). - Record you best runs and watch the replays. - Anime art style.   Cons: - Story is a little too short and although very good, could have been developed further. - Some weapons have very limited applications and are never used. - Replays don't record certain parts of some levels (such as Credits and Cutscenes) meaning you have to replay levels to see them again. - The game can be brutally difficult at times. - Voice acting is absent from almost the entire game, except the end of the second-to-last level and the last level making it feel weird and out of place. (  It is absent again in the secret 'Bonus' level  )  Final Words: ************** As I said at the beginning of this review, Sora is a great game, and is most certainly worth your time. I have had more fun playing Sora than I have in a long time with most other games, and I game alot. If there is one thing to take away from this review make sure it's this: There are far worse uses of your time than Sora!",
