            "review_text": " A Wild Catgirl Appears  is a really short - and not very well done - visual novel with a centering theme on female homosexuality. Yup, this is a Yuri title. I would really like to recommend this game, considering there aren't many otome visual novels that would even include same sex romance options and a game focusing on female homosexuality sounds like a concept to be supported - if only it would be better executed and accurately presented. Yet, the execution of the theme is really poor here, both with the boring narrative and non-existent character depth. It is just not a good game.  Here we have Ami, a shy and nerdy teenage girl who attends an all-female high school, alongside her best friend Ria. Her parents travel throughout the year to attend business meetings, so Ami has all the time and the space in the world to herself, and she is lonely. Stating a useful fact on the side: she is also gay and faces the fear of being judged if she were to come out of the closet. To keep herself busy, she decides to attend the Coding Club of the school and start working on a platform video game that they'd make with the senior club president, Lise. At some point, the designed protagonist of the game; a ninja cat girl named Starla comes alive, mostly to Ami's surprise and distress. How to handle this situation now?  Let's start with the display quality, shall we? There is an annoying inconsistency about the artworks and the CGs used for characters. Throughout my full playthrough, I've came across 4 different types of art works depicting the same characters ridiculously differently - none being appeasing or even anatomically correct. There has been some sorry attempts at presenting fan service, but no one should specifically prefer these ones for even that purpose. Environment designs are nothing remarkable or even remotely interesting, and the soundtrack is only forgettable. Oh, and there is no voice acting either.  I wouldn't care much for the art quality if only there were to be somewhat decent narrative and an intriguing storyline. Well, there is none! The storyline doesn't carry any drama, mystery, insight, sentimental attachment or anything that would make Ami's story interesting. She - alongside four romance options - and her ordeal, her frustration is presented as shallow as it can be. There is no credible story progression, no real life solution to the subject matter or a character portrayal that would make us emphasize with Ami. Character interactions are downright boring, with superficial social exchanges playing on the idea of female sexuality. Whomever wrote that script, clearly had no idea about an actual female/female relationship. The developer only established a sorry setting to play on some fantasy here and earn some money from it while he is at it. Aside portraying wholly shallow characters, the narrative is full with grammatical errors and dialogues marked for wrong characters. Without any option to reread the dialogue once its passed, it becomes a problem to keep track of whomever said what, and without much you'd be curious about the story itself, you lose interest fast.  To top all the nonsense this game contains, save game function is completely broken. If it's a Win64, sorry people. You cannot save at all. Developers are trying to solve that problem at the moment, but it seems like a problem with the game engine itself, so... no near future solutions yet. At least there is a skip dialogue option to go for fast playthroughs to achievement hunt.  At the end of the day, you may prefer passing this one. There is nothing intriguing or esthetically pleasing here. Even people who'd buy this to take a glimpse on some girl on girl action could probably do with something else better. Sad story.   Update: The save function for Win64 is seemingly fixed... and that's still the only plus about this game so far.

            "review_text": "Microsoft paint novel simulator.  It's a okay game but the art quality is not appealing like advertised.  Edit (2/24/16): The developer has made some effort to update some of the art and UI. However, since I already played it. I am probably not gonna play it again. It was really good to see that they changed and fix things but my negative review still stands because thats how they should of release it the first time.",

            "review_text": "I think my biggest problem with A Wild Catgirl Appears! is that the art styles are so vastly different at points that it throws me for a loop. Or maybe it's the dialogue? Or maybe it's the story line...  Either way, I got this game in a bundle for under a buck and I still feel as though it wasn't a particularly good use of my time. It took me two hours to get all the achievements (only because I did read through one path in totality before giving up and using the oh-so-helpful skip button) and two hours for the rest of the card drops. After that, I'll never boot this game up again--why would I?  Let's break this attempt at a visual novel down, shall we?  .Characters. Japanese school girls who attend an all-girls school and have very little parental supervision for one reason or another. That about sums them up. One is moe, one is shy, one is a ninja, and one is a ninja student. And then there's you, the loner main character. The cast is very generic to the genre.  .Story. You and a classmate are creating a game in a coding club after school. An after school club that has no members yet somehow has the funding to make RIF figures for a fully-functioning game that you create in a couple of sittings. Right. Your main character, Ami, takes the newly-made figure home and, lo-and-behold, you have a living, breathing cat girl and her cat girl friend that inexplicably accompanies her right in the comfort of your room. Ta-dah! And, for our next trick, the game makes these catgirls fit into society just like everyone else while your main character struggles to figure out which classmate or catgirl she'd like to date most.  The time frame of the game is very slippery. It feels as though the events, particularly the conclusion, just sort of bluster by as though the devs don't want you to think too hard about the logictics behind them.  'Inexplicable' is the key word for this game. There's a lot that doesn't get adequately described, but you're just kind of expected to accept things--much in the way that the characters do. No one questions the appearance of the titular 'wild catgirl' and no one even seems to care that a half-naked girl wearing cat ears is wandering around among the general public. Ah, Japan.  But back to the story: the catgirl, Starla (which, I'm sorry, is such an ugly name), infiltrates your life and you guys have fun together and school and clubs and yuri undertones.The four girls you meet are all romance options and the ending you get is based heavily on the rare A or B options you get at points in dialogue  Which brings us to our next point.   .Voice acting and dialogue. Most of it was irritating. Abrasive, even. I could forgive the voice acting if the things the voices said were at al interesting, but... Yeah, no. Not in the slightest. In fact, some of it felt stilted and/or forced coming from the mouth of a teenager or ninja catgirl.   .Art style. I didn't play the game before the big patch that apparently changed the art style, but it feels as though bits of the old art style, which can be seen in the achievements, have been left over. In fact, the art style varies on a scene to scene basis. What was that saying about too many chefs in the kitchen? Point being that the hodgepodge of graphical styles, some good and some... atrocious, did nothing for the game.  .Bottom line. If you're a card and achievement collector, sure. Buy this on sale. If you're looking for the next greatest visual novel, steer clear.",

            "review_text": "so as everyone says this is a short game and cheap as well. the artwork is not bad. the storyline to me was just all over the place. it felt so rushed. it lacked a plot, character development. just anything to make it stand out. the music was ok.   my biggest annoyance was the freaking menu. why is it not always there constantly like other vns? it would slowly come in from both sides. so you're screwed if you do auto because you constantly have to wait for it to appear then it will go to next line then menu then line etc. see how annoying that can be?   i think the other thing it lacked was not being able to see back logs of the chat. if you clicked too fast you missed what was said. i think its cool the dev is still working on it.  so as it stands i can't say its a great choice but if you don't expect much from it then you might enjoy it for a hour or so.",

This made me understand unrealistic beauty standards. And, animation, the neko that appears (30 minutes into the game) is the same exact ♥♥♥♥ING PICTURE as the concept art given to Lisa. Which shows why it's so low res.  The STORY! YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO GOD DAMN CONTROL OVER IT PRETTY MUCH! And a huge plot hole right as what's SUPPOSED to be the good part (more later) starts!
