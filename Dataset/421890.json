            "review_text": "It has promise and is marketed well with some celver screenshots. I thought this would be a campaign with different maps and some strategy by the looks of the pics and advertising. Instead, it ends up being essentially the same battlefield with only a slider to represent your progress in the form of percentage complete.   Neat concept, could use more depth, and would be better sutied on a mobile platfom.   I'll recomend it but only at $5.",
