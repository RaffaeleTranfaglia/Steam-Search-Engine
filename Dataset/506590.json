            "review_text": "Sky Valley is like a really beautiful but dumb girl. Pleasant to look at and spend time with at first, but as the hours drain away you realize there's an emptiness within it. All those good looks are just a facade that covers up the fact that there's nothing really behind it all. Just the same level over and over again with the same pleasant soundtrack backing you up.  What am I really complaining about? My time with this game only cost me $1. It is an IOS port. Sure my controller works in game but doesn't work in the menus at all. Sure the fuel pickups for the plane are badly spaced out and difficult to see so trial and error is the only way to get better at this title. But once again it was only $1.  10/10 would buy again at the same price, worth every 5 min I spent with it.",
