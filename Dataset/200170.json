            "review_text": "I need to start from history to figure out if its a good game or not. Im a big fun of worms since WORMS 1  - WORMS 1 &amp; 2 The first and Armageddon was crazy fun! You never can predict what will going on. Those tiny little worms , stuck in pixels and dies like a water drops. With a dozen fun weapons.  ps: there was also a upgraded version of Armageddon ITS FUN!  - WORMS 3D (all other versions) Its was something new, still fun but not in the same way. (if it was in 2015 , it would be a good game after years of polishing). For me it was special, not like before... but i played it cause i like worms. I loved a big big high platforms and unpredictable shooting.  - WORMS Revolution They tried to restore a Armageddon fun and they kinda made it! Thanks TEAM17  Pros: - Cool polished graphics - If you pass a single mode, you are the master. - Fun - Challenges - Every time i play worms with friend, even with skills you never know who will win.  Cons - THE TIME of calculation of a AI is too LONG! - THE AI is too predictable and really mathematically aiming (that is not fun) - The water is not a water; its gelatin - Many weapons are gone - Not a full destructible area (in old worms it was something that i loved to do , hit a Aliluia grenade and it will blow a half of the level with several mini impacts, but here is not the same) - No one never is online, poor multi player. - Cant play single player maps with my friends..  VERDICT:  If you need a challenge try WORMS if you love UNPREDICTABLE moments, try WORMS. If you never played WORMS, you must try WORMS.",

Each of them have their special abillity. Heavy are powerful but they move slowly. Scout are fast and jump high and long but are very weak. Scientist can heal but are weak too. Soldier are just Soldier. Epic 2D game with a lot of stuff. A lot of weapons such as uzi, petrol bomb, water pistol(it splash you and if you too deep you lose 5 lifes every new turn) and of course Epic Holy Hand Grenade there are too many items to count. There are also some items that are not in Worms Mayhem. Such us Flamethrower you can use it for dig in or to attack enemie...   Rate: 9.9/10.",

            "review_text": "I remember playing Worms at a friend's place when it had just came out, and I had a lot of fun playing versus friends locally on just one PC.  Playing Worms Revolution brought back some of those memories, however I ended up playing Worms Revolution mainly as a single player game. Some people say that Worms is a multiplayer game, and you're supposed to play it with other players, but I see nothing wrong with playing Worms solely for the single player campaign. If you do, just think of Worms as a sort of puzzle game, and you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Some of the missions were frustatingly difficult thanks to the incredibly accurate AI, but that just made completing them feel that much more rewarding.  I played this game at the same time as I was playing Worms Clan Wars, and in my opinion Worms Revolution is by far the superior game. You can read my review of Worms Clan Wars  here . I gave that game a negative review, not because I think it is a very bad game, but because this one is, in my opinion,  so  much better - and quite a bit cheaper as well.  Here's a few of the pros of Worms Revolution: - The narrator (which is actually  funny  in this game, unlike that annoying woman in Worms Clan Wars) - Plenty of challenging missions - Interesting weapons (the only weapon that I missed was the Teleportation Gun from Clan Wars) - Water physics  I can't really think of any big cons. The new worm-classes (Soldier, Scientist, Scout, Heavy) were a nice addition, although not really necessary in my opinion. It can also be a bit hard to find people online, especially if you want to play a ranked match.  Still, I definitely recommend this game.  →　If you are the type of person who cares about achievements, note that there are several multiplayer achievements in this game, which can be a bit troublesome to get.",

My wife and I picked up about 40 slugs and put them in a pair of my wife's panties. I then put the panties on. The feeling was amazing. I got a huge erection and I could feel them sliding over my glans, and round my balls. Eventually I could feel one going up my bum. I knew I would come soon, so I let my wife tie me up, with my hands and feet speadeagled and attached to some furniture. She then took the panties down and about 15 of the slugs were crawling over my ♥♥♥♥ and balls. I came, spurting out loads of ♥♥♥ all over the poor things, but still couldn't move. My wife then took the other slugs out of the panties and placed them on my ♥♥♥♥. She was careful to put some of them right on the opening of my ♥♥♥♥, which was now covered in a mixture of sperm and glistening goo from the slugs. She opened up my ♥♥♥♥ and tried to put one in there too. I got hard again quite quickly as I thought of these slimy little things crawling over me. I imagined them biting me. One seemed to be trying to enter my uretha and this caused me to come again. That was 4 hurs ago. My ♥♥♥♥ is now very itchy, but I am about to give them another 'feed'.",

This game took a step back from the classic 2d cartoon look and went more more with 3d models. While this is a bit strange at first, it does not change the overall experience.  Most everything one expects out of worms is still here. Bazooka, grenades, holy hand grenade, concrete donkey and whatnot are mostly present. While this incarnation does indeed miss some items Worms: Armageddon had, it does not feel as this is any less of a game.   This game introduced different classes of worms as well as physics objects in the field. This added a new layer of strategy for our beloved worm killing battlefield. Also the scale of maps is much greater and different sized blast radii take time for adjustment. (A heavy throwing a holy hand grenade makes a massive hole, even compared to previous games)  What this game does lack is the size of sound bank, and other customization option. You can costumize your worms but it feels as there is much less to chose from. Also the max team size is still 4. While this isn't such a big deal, it does remove the mass mayhem some fondly remember from Armageddon days.  Overall this version of worms is well worth the time, while lacking in some content it still offers a good value and amusement.",

            "review_text": "With Worms Revolution being the first Worms game I actually sat down and played since the awesome Worms World Party, I was a bit sceptical at first because the little bit I saw from the 3D Worms Games in between didn´t really click with me.  This scepsis was enforced when I was greeted with the most clunky menu design I ever had to witness ... so much clicking and so confusing at the same time. Even when you got into it, it´s still a bit of a chore, escpecially in Online Play, wchich would really benefit in a better and more clear system to get games easily going.  This, however, is my only big grasp with WR since the remaining game turns out to be quite excellent. I quite enjoyed the new game mechanics as in the water and the physics objects, which give the game a really nice twist.  The weapons are awesome as usual with some cool new stuff, especially in the water department. The often critisised ninja rope has been changed a lot but once you got used to it it handles just fine, only different. Also, the new worms classes, while they don´t feel that special at first, actually develop a lot of depth and strategy once you learn their uses. I also enjoyed the single player mode very much. The campaign is pretty challenging and the enemy AI has a near perfect hit rate sometimes, but this can always be overcome with the right strategies. In total with the DLCs there are over 70 missions, which is a lot and should keep busy for a while.   So all in all, I´d definately recommend WR. Make the menus better, and therefore have easier access to multiplayer matches and you are nearing the perfect worms experience.",

Some thing that all Worms games have is the bounce physics of things such as grenades; they're quite difficult to handle for new timers and require careful presision.  Despite that critisism, this game is fun to play and even more enjoyable online.",

The title is a really interesting play on the theme of this game, symbolizing the struggle the main character has with his inner self, really good writing guys well done. This game has made me rethink my actions of just killing A to get to B, honestly I really enjoyed this game, and I hope this studio makes more games like this.
