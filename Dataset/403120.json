            "review_text": "Half-baked game. I disagree with the notion that it doesn't matter it's no fun to play because it's only $5. I wouldn't pay $5 for a pile of dog crap even if it was on sale. I almost didn't buy it when I read that it isn't the board from the actual board game of the same name, but it's certainly possible for the game's board to be improved as long as they hold to the original mechanics. They don't. And the result is a much flatter game without dynamic options like Promisary Notes and Stock purchases.  As far as options go, you can adjust music and sound effect levels. And while alt-return does activate windowed mode, you can't adjust the size of the window past its full-screen size. The graphics have bright colors and sparkles, but no anti-aliasing, so it's a pretty rough clash.  Lots of times the cards you get dealt from landing on tiles aren't up long enough for a slow reader like me to absorb. Consequently during many of the unnecessary minigames I find myself saying, 'Wait, what the hell is going on? What happened to the Game of Life? Is it my turn? Where did I set the bong?'  In that light, I wouldn't recommend it even for a 5 year old, partly because of the game's assumption that you read quickly, and partly because a 5 year old can be amused by an empty egg carton. The fact that a 5 year old finds the bright colors amusing in this game isn't a very good litmus test for the value of the game.  Wouldn't recommend this game for 99 cents. You might as well shove that dollar bill up your butt. The sensation will be more pleasant.",
