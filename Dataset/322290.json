            "review_text": "Really fun game. Played a lot of it on PSP back a few years ago but never actually owned the game until now. Nice artstyle and fun zelda-esque gameplay. The game also runs locked at 30fps (I think but im not entirely sure) so if you're the kind of person that wines about 30fps then you might want to hold out until someone unlocks the framerate. Otherwise Gurumin is A cheap, fun RPG from the creators of Ys. Pick it up if you're a fan of Zelda or games like it.  The game has a pretty choppy/weird performance for a lot of people (including me). Its annoying at times but it isn't much of a bother. (However if this is something that bothers you, You might want to wait for a patch or a mod that fixes it or try turning off Vsync. Which fixed the problem for a lot of people)  EDIT: A little side note. The game has trading cards marked in the steam store, However the game does not have any trading cards at the moment. They'll probably be added in a few days or so though.  EDIT 2: The game has recieved an update which adds WASD to the control scheme.  TL;DR - Fun Zelda-like game. However is held down by Questionable control scheme and 30fps lock.  8/10",

            "review_text": "A fun, super-charming 3D action game. You get a bunch of different headgear to serve as equipment, with some shared and some unique benefits, like the gas mask protects from poison gas, goggles from water damage, etc. Headgear can be leveled up to improve their effects and add new ones like damage reduction and damage multipliers. You only have a drill as a weapon, with three exchangeable elemental parts but they all play the mostly the same aside from some enemies being weak to different elements. There's a bunch of special moves you unlock through buying parts for your drill and they're all easy enough to perform.  The gameplay is separated into short dungeon crawls, with no area being any longer than twenty minutes or so. Each area has two regular stages, then a boss, then two more 'secret' stages that can be unlocked by solving some type of riddle. There's enough stages to give the game a solid length and it ends before becoming tedious.  Being a 3D action/platformer, the camera control can be a bit finicky, especially since the game doesn't an option to map the right analog stick on the controller as camera control, instead defaulting to the shoulder bumpers. You get used to it after a while though, and it's never too big of a problem. The first platforming section with water is probably the worst in the game for various reasons, so don't fear if you flub it up a bunch. There's not a ton of precise platforming here. Otherwise, the game controls well. Parin moves fast and attacks fast. If you've played previous Falcom games, you already know they know how to do fast-paced action really well. The music and sound effects are good, too, as you'd expect from a Falcom game.  As for the story/voice acting stuff, it's bleh and generic for the most part, but the lead character has a good dub and the game has a ton of little charming touches that overshadow the problems. NPC dialogue is pretty fun and you can examine a bunch of stuff in-game and Parin will comment on it. The game's artstlye has aged really well, so even though it's technically unimpressive, the game never really looks bad due to a strong stylistic foundation.  For those that like to replay/master rank games, there's a ton here, like multiple unlockable difficulties and extra headgear/costumes to find and even a secret playable character. It you don't care about that kind of thing, it can be safely ignored without hurting your experience.   As for the port, it's a bit of a mixed bag at this point. I'd played it 1080p, and there was a constant white line along the top of the screen, only really noticeable during the letterboxed cinematics but it's there. There's also appears to be issues with new game+ stuff unlocking incorrectly, as I had one of the extras upon starting up a new game+, but it seemed to have disappeared forever after quitting the game and reloading. I imagine these types of bugs will be fixed in the near future.  In short, if you're looking for a fast-paced, light-hearted 3D action game, Gurumin is what you're looking for, especially considering how few likeminded games like this there are available on PC.",

It reminds me a bit of those PS1 action platformers like crash bandicoot and spyro and such. Probably because of the graphics quality and style.  While it looks a bit low poly, the graphics is good enough for what it does, and the style makes up for it. It all look pretty cute. The quality on sound effects and music is quite good.  The action platforming is also quite nice, not too easy, and certainly not too diffcult.  The bosses in the game pack quite a punch, but by the first boss you'll probably have figured out how to dodge those.  All 'n all, a great game for anyone that loves 3d action platformers.",

You want a new Goemon game? Just pretend Parin is Ebisumaru and you'll feel it. You'll  feel  it, son.  One look at the style of the game from its screenshots and you will not be surprised to hear me say the controls feel clunky at first. You need to stick with it, though! It very quickly becomes comfortable. On a scale from 'any modern Sega game' to 'dat mario gamefeel' I'd rate it a solid 'Resident Evil 4.'  When this comes out for 3DS, I'll be buying it and playing it all over again.",

Most of the gameplay is simple but addicting, it's a nice little fighting system with some basic combo's, and some expandable or upgradable attacks. There are about 25 levels and some bosses to complete plus some minigames, and if you want to collect all outfits, upgrade all items, and get S+ ratings on every level, there's plenty of playing time.  If you buy this, ( and yes, i recommend you do! ) you should try to play it with a controller (supported), because the keyboard and mouse dragging options are not perfect for this game, in my opinion.

            "review_text": "Gurumin is an action platformer developed by Falcom in 2003. The project was helmed by the same group who made Zwei but is about a girl who uses a drill to defeat enemies and dig through structures instead of using a partner to shoot magic and relies on eating to boost stats. This title was also made when Nihon Falcom was sorta in a rut and didn't find financial success to run on until Sora no Kiseki Second Chapter. This really shows now adays as Gurumin looks no better than a N64 game with improved textures to dabble with.   The game's still fun, albeit very very simple. The music is kinda boring, the enemies are slow and easy, the map design is kinda rudamentary. All and all this seems like a simple game whipped up by a studio and dev team to just clear some technical checkpoints. This is a Banjo Kazooie/Mario 64/Ape Escape/Crash Bandicoot clone that while fun is just lacking in so many areas.   It's charming, cheap, and worth a try. Give it a whirl if you like the team behind it, but I wouldn't really say get it if you're looking to revist the era where action platformers dominated the market because this is not the next Jet Force Gemini.",

            "review_text": "MUH DRILLZ!  I'll get straight to the point: this game will definitely drill its way into your heart. *pause for laughter or groans*  *ahem* now that I have you either groaning from the pun or laughing your ♥♥♥ off, I'll start the real review.  This game comes to steam years later from the initial release in japan back in 2004, which got ported to PSP in June of 2006, made a north american appearance in 2007, and got an original PC release worldwide on steam. From my point of view, everything about this game is great, with just a few minor complaints I have, which I will get to in this review.  Graphics: 9/10 - The graphics remind me of early playstation games such as Brave Fencer Musashi. They get the job done, vibrant, and great use of color. You can also tell it makes great use of cell-shading, but the characters do tend to look a little too simplistic. Overall, however, this game looks great.  Gameplay: 9.5/10 - The game plays very well, and that's as much as I can say about it right now as I've only just started playing this game. I will definitely update when the time comes, but one minor complaint: so far, I haven't really run into any boss fights. EDIT: Just ran into my first boss fight, and lemmie tell ya, they can really drill it to ya -pause again for laughs or groans-. They're challenging, but fair. It at least gives you time to use healing items and not have them clobber you as you do so. Overall, the boss fights are great and vibrant.  Controls: 8/10 - Here's where I have to make a few complaints about controls here. Some of the moves aren't very clear on what to do, especially if you're using a gamepad (or xbox 360/XBOne controller) for control. The instructions are strictly PC oriented with no mention of what to do with the gamepad. I would complain about it more, if it weren't for the fact that you learn pretty quickly what buttons do what move, so it's no big issue and the controls can be customized*.  However, the controls do the job well, either way. The jump controls are interesting, but can get a little frustrating, especially having to make platform jumps. Fortunately, the shadow effects will help you, and you can angle the camera any way you please (right stick for xbox 360 controllers). The inclusion of timed hits to the beat of the music with the beat bar displayed on screen is a wonderful addition. If you've mastered Crypt of the Necrodancer, you'll definitely find that getting critical hits via the beat of the music to be very easy and fun.  Sound: 9/10 - The music, even though you can tell it's synthesizer, is VERY well done. The english voice acting is a bit cheesy, but works anyways. The music is upbeat and well composed, in my opinion. You'll need to get that tempo down if you want to do critical hit damage, but the timing of each beat is precise and works very well.  Overall: 9.25/10 - This game is definitely a title for platform gamers to really dig into -pause for groans or laughter-. Hopefully, we'll see some patches released to fix some of the issues, but overall, I recommend this game for anyone who loves a good platform game.   *At least the options to do that are up, but I've seen some forum posts about the game not running because options got changed. Hopefully, this gets patched soon, as I did suffer the same thing when I tried to change around a few options. Should you find your game not starting up, just hit the restore defaults button on the windows menu screen that comes up and it'll start normally again. I have successfully changed a few options after having do to this, but kept it to just force feedback and maybe one other thing.",

Because of that, I can't complain too much, especially being that this is a very old title and therefore is bound to have issues here and there.   That being said, the framerate is rather choppy, and the game seems to crash in strange ways for me. For instance: Talking to the NPC in the starting town that gives you the goggles caused my video driver to crash (using AMD 7970HD GPU). Holding the spacebar caused my character to jump in place, or rather, cause the jumping animation to loop and the jumping sound effect to play rapidly without the character actually leaving the ground. I do wish there was a way to bring the game upto 60FPS proper; Applications such as fraps will report 60 FPS, but this doesn't seem to actually be the case (menus run at that framerate, but in-game animations do not, according to what I've read).   Seems theres still a few bugs to work out. If you have the game already, there's generally no reason to be pessimistic; Its visually charming, and playthroughs seem to imply that its a rather fun time. But unfortunately, I wouldn't know as I can't get the goggles, as explained earlier in this post.  TL;DR: If you have it already, great. If you're contemplating a purchase, dont; at least, not yet.
