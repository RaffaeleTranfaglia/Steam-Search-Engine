But the developers of a much loved series (gone bad with this MMO) have given you a chance, all you have to do is give in to their micro transactions.  I dont see why they cant have a one off payment for the game, up front, like any other game, instead of implementing a pay to win system. What could be a truly wonderful game is ruined by the fact that you can pay to beat the system.  Do not download, regret will swallow your mind.",

Thats just the beginning of the problems with this game. SHK is a ptw game with a rather cancerous community. I had met some nice people, but the amount of backstabbing, scheming elitism that goes with this game is horrendous. If you are just starting out, be prepared to be run over repeatedly. Also the fact that practically any castle build can be cracked wide open with a single attack makes no sense and makes the time you took to build your castles pointless. And in SHK, it is conciderd 'tactical' by the community of 'pros' to attack someone when they are not online due to the fact that you can buy cards that can be used when online to help defend. SO after spending weeks, months of building villages and expanding, you can wake up one morning and find it all gone. Or if your lucky , maybe just a few of your villages will be captured or destroyed, along with a letter from someone telling you if you decide to try and do something about it, they will just send their entire faction of trolls after you. If you are retired and have all the time and money to burn on a pointless game, give it a shot. If not, stay away from this pile of $#!t.",

The city vs. castle vs. parish castle vs. region castle can get a bit confusing, and the parish/region mechanics make it near impossible for a non-faction aligned player to have any influence. While it does have some Stronghold flair, it suffers from too many MMO/Browser game limitations.",

For years people have been screaming for a tablet version of this game because GOOD GOD does it feel like it should be on a tablet. Will the devs ever listen? No of course not. Why should devs listen to their community? Speaking the community...  The community is a mixed bag of strange roleplayers, trolls and clueless newbies so... sort of like most MMOs.  It is a fun mix of city building/rts/castle building and politics, I just wish it had less bugs and devs who wanted to provide a more complete gaming experience.

It took me 30days (without using any cash) to build a fully defended castle, by fully i mean every single space are filled, while army are fully placed.  BUT it only took other players few minutes (depends on travel distance) to COMPLETELY wipe it out. Which means my castle is gone forever. So all those effort and time used to built it are all wasted. ALL OF MY HARD WORK  But I won't complain though, just giving my thoughts, this is part of the game :)  TL;DR:  Pros -Game contents are satisfying -Game mechanics are basic and simple  -Easy to get rich and powerful as you progress to higher rank (there's a con for this) -Ranks and skills remain if you lost everything  Cons -Pay2Win game -Excessive amount of time to build (depends on player) -Insane amount of time to up skills once your rank get higher -Your can lose your castles in a blink of an eye  ",

            "review_text": "Rise of The Wolf update has damaged this game, especially if you are relatively new.  I enjoyed the game when I first started, it was a very slow paced medieval city builder with custom designed castles and such. I spent my days gaining resources and slowly beefing up my stronghold and donating extra resources to my local parish capitol.  Days of doing this was quite relaxing, and the occasional Ai attack spiced things up. Seeing how well my newly made fortifications held up against 30, then 60, then 100, then 130 enemies was quite fun.  I also thought it was very cool getting to view battles between my parish and our enemy Ai, Pig. Large scale battles taking place every day while we fuel the parish with resources was amazing.  Then Rise of The Wolf happened.  All at once we had an enemy Siege camp, wolf dens, bandit camps, Pig and its castle of doom, and all of the associated negative morale. Pig for what ever reason appears to target my town exclusively, on top of daily sieges and bandit raids.  Within 3 days my forces had been reduced to 3 archers and 2 morale resulting in a single peasant every 12 hours, my food consumption was set to max to boost morale with very little effect and my taxes were already starting to drain what little gold reserve I had. Then I realize that no one is attacking Pig, the siege camp, or the bandits.. and it appears most of their aggression is focused towards me. Our parish apparently had been innactive for several days prior so help from them was a long ways off.  After speaking out in global chat, I found out that I am not the only one facing this scenario. The competent players are away or ignoring the enemies, while the weak and defenceless are destroyed by the new enemy spawn rate.   So, unless you know a strong player and can get cozy with them and their army, stay away until Rise of The Wolf is put to rest.",

If you've got the real-life money to support the in-game upgrades, then you're fine and you'll really enjoy the game, without, you're kinda ♥♥♥♥ed. For a 'free' game, it's not so free. The whole game is in real-time, and that's ok. However, with every building you place, and every thing you research, it bumps up the time. No matter the type of building, or research option. Just adds minutes to the time. And that's not so bad, until it hits over 30 minutes and you haven't got the tokens to have a building and research queue.  So with this, it takes a long time to build up a decent, protected base with enough peasants to train a competent army to defend your stronghold. Problem with that is, you're a new player, and this is an online world. A lot of players will ignore rule 7 - don't be a ♥♥♥♥, and just attack you for the sake of attacking. For me, who is a slow learner, that just makes the game even harder and unfair. the 2 days worth of protection at the beginning is great, but I think that needs to be a week. In a week you an have a decent wooden defence line and a good-ish sized army (depending on how happy you keep the peasants) to protect your stronghold after the timer goes out.   Other than that, the user friendly-ness of the game is great, and I love the option that you get to keep the tutorial pages near by, in case you forget anything, then you an just turn it off when you're ready, and that's awesome. The graphics are alright, but since they're really simple, it doesn't lag your computer, which is a bonus if you run off wireless all the time like me.  I also like having the different tabs at the top, keeping everything seperated out and neat really helps you get to grips with the game.  So overall, I like the game and won't stop playing it, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm just stubborn and miss being able to play the old Stronghold games.(Saving the money up for the complete pack though)  ",

The actually game play is very slow with building times and research times getting longer and longer each time you build or research something. The scouts take about half an hour (real time) to reach an item and return when it is not that far away from your kingdom or village.   Until about 10 minutes ago (from when I'm writing this), I was queueing things up like buildings and research items so I could leave the game to work for me. Now, I have to get premium coins to queue things. This means I have to check on everything more often and the game play is slow enough as it is.   Now I understand this is a Free to Play game so I would guess the company would put an option in to buy things with real money so they can get some money from it but when one of the achievements is to buy coins? It makes it a game I want to punch in it's metaphorical face.   I'm going to continue to play this game because I am determined to find a way to win without paying but don't start if you haven't already.",

Pros : Tutorial Amazing Soundtrack Addicting Gameplay 'Notice board' is up to date with raids and attacks gone wrong or gold.  Cons : Not like original Stronghold games, whereas this is multiplayer and not singleplayer. (1/2 due to this being amazing as an online game.) In order to win you have to spend real-life money on a virtual online game to dominate anyone.  Now, what I have experienced in this game.  *First Time Playing* Is introduced by lilerk, a friend of mine. Continues to grow and create my kingdom, only to be stuck in the village level and un-able to fend off invasions due to no help from other kingdoms.  *Second Time Playing* Restarted, lilerk gives me mercs so I can fend off my kingdom. Stays in village level.  *Third Time Playing* Is halfway through the ranks but still can't fend off kingdom due to no mercs ALIVE. Is invaded each hour and loses control on populus  *Fourth Time Playing* Writes review to show my pros and cons and experience.   DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?  If you are a Stronghold fan and knows what it takes to become a bad-butt king, yes, I recommend it. If you are new to the series and this is your first time playing an online kingdom game where the tutorial is short, no, why? Because it's simply PAY TO WIN.

            "review_text": "Oh dear, Oh dear.  Before I begin, I would like to point out the major problem I have with most 'free to play' games, Well, two.  1. They suck 2. They seem to all be based of the 'Farmvile Forumla'  Do not get me wrong, there are plenty of Free to Play games that do not do that, like Tribes Ascend, Star Trek Online after the F2P conversion, and a few others that operate on the concept of 'Pay because you're having fun and want to support it.' not 'Pay because you have to.' Those games are fine. Hell, I enjoy playing STO still, even after the F2P change.  Stronghold Kingdoms, on the other hand..is a medival reincarnation of Farmvile, but even more hands off! I came into the game expecting a cut-down version of Stronghold, but what I got out of it was pretty much like the fabled 'Age of Empires Online'.  When you're put into the game, you're given a basic tutorial, and some things to help. Sadly, it's not much (unless you preordered Crusader 2, or bought the starter pack for some reason), and even if you manage to make do, it's only a matter of time before you run into some barrier, like lack of resources or even not having enough gold. When that happens, you either have to bug your friends, making them hate your guts forevermore, or get your credit card and pay up, which, again, seem very much like the Facebook games we're all spammed with.  So then, would I reccomend this game? Are you joking?! It makes me worry for the future of a decent series, being all pay to win and such.",

            "review_text": "I originally played this back in summer 2012 and returned summer 2014 to see what had improved. But like all free to play games it just has too many limitations and timers to recommend on a long term basis.  What's good - Watching your village becoming fully operational, scouting, trading, researching and seeing the occasional level up process, watching the battles from bandit camps, wolf lairs or your castle keep  What's bad - timeframe limits, the only thing that stops this is Maths but ultimately everything just takes too much time unless you play an insta-build card or time speed card and even then it only lasts a few hours. Castle building takes days, village building takes hours, raising your own military requires several researches and buildings which you 'must' have unless you like being attacked regularly by the AI and having no means of defending yourself thus losing resources. The card system is a mess and you have to click through them until you find what you wanted at the time. 7 day premium tokens and cards are where they want you to pay but really unless you can fully use a 7 or 30 day token dont even bother. If you want me paying £3 a throw I expect a 30 day token, not a 7 day one, I think the 7 day ones should be scrapped entirely. But back to my point, you need merchants+speed, scouts+speed, max housing capacity and military to fully get your moneys worth from the tokens, all of which takes time. The biggest thing that kills the game however is research, once you run out of RP you either need to level up or spend gold to get more, Philosophy helps with this but like Maths it's a temporary fix at best.  Conclusion - when I first played I was around a few weeks and then left, there were several things I never got to experience like trading for gold or helping a house/faction take an area while watching big all out battles occur, never raided a vilage, never done parish heals, and it goes on and on because the game is basically a giant timesink even with a premium token. Does the token speed everything up? No! Does the token provide you with extra research points? No! And guess what...when you use a token it ONLY applies to the world you were in instead of applying to ALL worlds, sorry but I want my 7 or 30 days to cover all worlds that I play instead of just the 1, forcing you to buy several tokens for the worlds you do play in assuming you can get any fun or enjoyment out of this game. Sorry Stronghold Kingdoms but ultimately you dont offer enough benefits to justify the time spent in the game and you don't do things you SHOULD be doing. Personally I dont have the time to stay up and wait for a timer to end just so I can see the end result. Which means I wont spend the money for cards and/or tokens unless I felt like I was getting proper value for money. You can do better and you can implement changes like what you did for banner creation or the recent avatar update. Give us players more options, more choices, scrap the 7 day token and make the 30 day one viable for 3 pounds a throw, give somebody like me enough of a reason to play and it's a very viable F2P game. But until you do these things I cannot recommend the game long term. This ends my review.  FusionBunny",

Also the comunity is really nice and helpful, it`s easy to integrate and to find friends who help you.  The biggest negative point i know about the game is that you can build (and mostly HAVE to build if you want to survive) your village and / or castle in a certain way, which is totally unreal and takes all the freedom of building i hoped to find in this game.

I was very dissapointed, since I used to play the original Stronghold and loved every second of it. I still play here and there. I just log on once a day, long enough to cue everything I can up, knowing that at any time I could be attacked an lose everything I have built. It is kind of like an experiment to me now. I am testing how far I can get without attracting enemies to crush me.  If I had never played this game, knowing what I know now about it, I would not have started. Since I invested so much time into the game mechanics, I figure I might as well mess around with it.

I have approximately 2000 hours of game time, but on the site version. I got this again to mess around when I needed it. The game is great if you find a cool group to hang out with (Find Jezdeb, or Maria Sine, on any world tell them Lord Dark sent ya, then be loyal and you’ll have a blast, best gang ever)  The politics are great, combat is fun, and the whole world feels SO alive... Honestly when I started it was like the stratgist dream... The pay to win was not as big. You could buy cards, but none did THAT much, and they would be quickly drained. To really get an edge you had to KNOW how the game worked, and that took time, skill and thought. The game STILL NEEDS that. Yes EVEN if you put 2K into this you will FAIL MISERABLY if you do not understand how the game works VERY well.   I guess the biggest problem here is that, there are a few hundred players, who actively play on almost every world who LITERALLY devote their lives to this game, play nothing else, and spend tens of thousands of dollars on this game, a few to many people take it WAY to seriously.   Now if you don’t want to be the next greatest faction to rule the realm, and your okay with playing hide under interdiction then burn, and if your okay with trying VERY hard to fight, you will LOVE this game, EVEN STILL. It gets harder and harder though. Each “Card Release” adds more and more ways for those who pay to pay more, but do SO much more. There is nothing they get, so special units, nothing like that, just speed increase. That’s what this game focuses on strategy and time management. If you want to get into this game, message my steam profile, I’ll try and get you in with some of the good people, I had connections everywhere.   If you play this game you will understand what I mean when I say, the community CAN save the game, if you find the right group, or it can kill it in the wrong one. I mean who doesn’t love to join a BRAND NEW server and have people be like “Hey dude, I remember you, you destroyed my faction last game, you guys are so cool!” Or have loads of hatemail after burning a whole group of players.  TLDR: I stopped this game cause it took up way to much of my time not the P2W, it is P2W, but its’ STILL VERY FUN! Try it out, send me a message if you do and I’ll drop ya some tips. The games fun, really fun, just you have to learn the tricks, and trust me, there are millions, a good player CAN outdo one who pays to play. You just gotta try hard.",

Its simple and fun to play, but i thought it would be really cool if their was a battle feature where two armies could fight in an open field. The players would only be able to set thier troops up, then they could watch the battle unfold. To do one of these battles, a player would be notified that an attacking army was on their way, and would be given two options, either send an army to meet the invaders, or to trust in your defenses and let the armies attack. I thought this improvement would make the game a little more realistic, seeming how a king probably wouldnt let an army attack him if he knew he could fight the invaders before they got to his stronghold.",

I would have over 1,000 hours but even the numbers are not accurate as this game is slow and the game can be minimized but still adds to the hours.   So how's the game? You have to try it to give it a review and i recomend playing untill you are a high rank.   If you are a new player it is best that you join the newest world which at the moment is Latin America1. If you start on a world that is in another age that means there are high level players and it will be harder to get territory.  The game overall is fun and after you learn how everything works then you enjoy the game to the fullest. People alwaays complain about the players that buy cards and have a bigger advantage. I dont see a problem with that as that is how the game gets its revenue to make monthly updates.

For example: Rat - Grey Snake - Green Pig - Pink Wolf - black Enemy Siege Camp - Purple Another Player - Red  You could use any colors you like, but then when you watch the battles it gives a little variety and you can tell who is attacking from the color of the army.

Also i think research points shouldnt cost as much gold as it does after buying them only a few times, and you should gain more with higher lvls reached not just 3 everytime i lvl up in honour. Also a better way to veave threw inactives it sucks having inactive members in your parish that are no help i think you should be abke to report a player inactive that way the faster their village can be removed. thank you, yours truly Blood_Hound_MP  ",

            "review_text": "First of all don't get fooled by my play time on this game. I normally play through the stand alone client and have 2 years of experience. Now taking about the game... i can honestly say this is one of the best mmorpg games i have ever played. Although the graphics look like it's from the late 1990s, the fact that this requires so much communication between players especially in wars, makes it so much addictive even without decent graphics. It is free to play but as all f2p games are, there are special bonuses for people who pay. There is no premium account here, rather a premium token which grants the player several bonuses like research and building queues, auto trade, scout and recruit troops. These are generally in from of 7-day and 30-day tokens which can be bought but there are 2-day tokens which are given in the tutorial and some quests. The fact that free players can have these 2-day tokens from quests in multiple worlds makes them at level with the payers. Also another thing that is bought are cards. Now these give massive boost to almost everything in the game. Free players do gain cards by completing quests, but this is nowhere near the amount of cards bought by payers. This is where the games get very pay to win. A f2p player can easily get frustated at this and leave. But there is a way to carry on. A f2p player just needs to communicate with the payers and ask them for help. Most will gladly agree and also invite them to factions if the player is active. Now in a faction, different people gather together and can help each other out in times of need whether its war or building up. Lot of f2p players complain that payers can get their villages, castles and armies up in seconds with cards. This is true and very frustating for a f2p, but through communication and diplomacy, you can get resources to make the same. But the drawback is that it does take a lot of time. The fact that there is no limit to the amount of cards that a player can purchase is a very serious drawback to the game for f2p players. The only way to get round this is to leave pvp to carders and play the role of a supplier or monker to the fighters for f2p players. This creates the necessicity for lot of communication and that is one of the strong points in the game. In war, helping others with resources and monking(influencing) requires so much communication, that one is able to lose sleep! However the chat system is pretty flawed and people don't use the mail syestem that much because it takes too much time. That's why people use 3rd party programs like teamspeak and skype to communicate. You can have many villages and that too with of different types which grant special resources, research different technologies, create different armies, battle the AI, wolves and other players. The main goal is to win the age and you can only do that if you are in a faction/house. So this is not a solo game and requires teamwork. It is possible to succed as a f2p player if you know the game mechanics very well and communicate with others, but if not then you can get very bored easily. The most inetersting part comes when war takes place, as you feel the urge to be online almost all the time lest your villages get destroyed by the enemy and also to take them out while they are offline! And as stated before this requires huge amounts of communication which can help us create new friends. The faction and house is literally like a family when you play for long with them. Altogether this is a great free to play game but not close to the best. If you can spend some cash or dedicate enough time this will really become very addictive :) I would recommend this to others who want to play strategy games and have a lot of patience.

Its more of a bonus than actual gear like in some game that would make you immortal. Ex.: You can put card down to make you army move faster for 12 hour, or you can play card that make a precise building free of time and ressource but nothing that is permenant.  I will give a modest review of 7/10 because this game isn't made for everyone. I wouldn't recommend it to child since there is a politic aspect.",

It's not pay to play, but if you pay enough money, you can certainly get many advantages and be far ahead of anyone who didn't pay in terms of progression. I wouldn't say pay to win necessarily, but it's close.  I enjoy slow-playing this game, content with any losses that i might incur. In practice, you can set yourself up just to do research and city building and by and large be left alone. If that's what you want it's possible. If you want a game that you can waste many hours on, with rapid tactics and counter tactics being the only thing between survival and losing all your cities, you can have that too.

But really, I don't think the point of this game was to simulate economics and production, I'm sure the game operates in such a way for balance purposes. As for the 'pay to win' aspect, I haven't spent a penny yet and have still had a great time with the game. No doubt spending money will give you atvantages, otherwise why would people spend money on it? But is it a reason to not play this game? IMO, no it isn't. Playing smart and more micro-intesively can give you benefits which the big card players may not take advantage of, albeit they may be smaller benefits then outright spending money.

            "review_text": "Stronghold kingdoms is a difficult game to explain at the outset, so I'll just go over the basics without going past a few paragraphs. It's a good game, though it requires a lot of patience, for reasons you can read below if you want. In sum, it's for a patient, deliberate type of gamer, and is certainly a rewarding experience. Onto the real meat:  You'll see pretty much every negative review on this game say it's 'pay to win', which shows that they took one look at the game, saw that they had to pay, and then quit. It's essentially a subscription-based model, where you pay for premium either by the week or the month, which makes progressing through the game much faster than if you were a free player. It rounds out to about $8 a month, plus some spare change left over to buy card packs. At the cost of a Netflix subscription (or a large case of soda), it's worth the money to spend just for the benefits that you get as a premium member. The only way for money to become a serious problem is if you're spending thousands of dollars on the game to progress at ludicrously fast speeds, at which point the player is a bigger problem that the game can handle.  So now onto the review. The game is a medieval, strategy-based, simulation MMO where you build a kingdom, interact with other kingdoms, and do your best to balance the two without going overboard. It doesn't sum up the tense and thoughtful experience that you get with the game, nor will most of the promotional materials. It's a game about tactics, waiting, thinking, and looking into the future to see what you best actions will be a day or two from now. It's an accurate simulation of the politics and world-building of the middle ages all bottled up into a deliberately paced experience, one that's definitely worth trying out just to feel the experience.  Naturally, time is an important factor in this game. To get anything done, you need to produce raw materials with your buildings. This includes resources, weapons, and gold - all of which you have to wait a while to get in large amounts. By 'a while', it's more like hours until you have the opportunity to expand on a larger scale - waiting for your village to populate, your buildings to produce, and your merchants to trade with others. Much like an idle game, it's best to wait a long time between play sessions to get the most out of your game. Otherwise you'll be checking it all the time, obsessed over when you have the opportunity to start developing. Unlike an idle game, it's not just a matter of upgrading the most expensive thing you can afford and waiting for another day. Indeed, you spend a long time looking over all the options you have at your disposal until you realise you don't have anything left to do at the time.  There is a level of depth and strategy in this game that is completely unique from most games that I've played. The game is simply about optimisation - you have to optimise your buildings, your research, your village placement, your military, and the production of materials to create all these. You also have to optimise the timeframe of when you create these events. This means you have to decide what to create, when to create it, how it will affect your village, your military, and your production, and you have to know if it'll create any difference in the short term to realise your long-term plans. It is a deep experience to go into, with the possibilities rolling in your mind the entire time you're looking at your village statistics. It's like upgrading your character in an RPG, feeling the same amount of pride you do in yourself as you do with your kingdom.  Also, you don't need to worry too much about the community. Pretty much all of the players are friendly, looking out for their best interests instead of trying to ruin your day. Most battles are petty, with a small-time raider taking the resources of another village far away - even then only if they're an incredibly weak and defenseless target. If you're at the point where you can let anybody walk in and take your resources, then you let that happen to yourself. The only way for a decent player to have all their villages destroyed is to ♥♥♥♥ off a large vassal without making any diplomacy, which is how all my villages were destroyed two years ago.  In essence, it's a good game, whether or not you can pay the subscription fee. It gets much better and much faster if you can pay for it, and it is an investment I recommend. It isn't at all a distilled experience like you get with almost every other kingdom-building game on the market, and is a worthy video game in it's own right. It's a unique and engrossing game for sure, and it's one you can download in a few minutes and try out. You do get a two-day subscription to see if you like it, which is a nice feature, if a bit like bait. I really do like this game, even if all my playtime is off the Steam client.  P.S. if you're curious, my handle is 'Enthers'. Please don't raid my apple farms.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Stronghold Kingdoms is a fun and addicting Free 2 Play RTS that is as punishing as it is rewarding. Be warned, this game is really complicated and hard to learn so don't be afraid to ask for help, there is a starters tutorial in there that explains the very basics and i mean the VERY basics, all it tells you is how to build things in your village and castle and maybie a few other small things, there are a few quests that help you get the hang of the game though. In my opinion this game isn't all that P2W, at least from what i've seen. When you spend money on this game you can get either one of seven random card packs that gives you random cards five cards as the name suggests or premium which allows you to que up five buildings in your villages, aswell as five researches, when selling your goods it gives you the option to find the highest and lowest prices and the ability to add protection to your village up to 15 days, the last one I haven't figured out how to use. Aswell as a few automated things that IMO aren't too useful. When starting off I reccomend starting near a friend that knows how to play that can teach you some of the basics that the tutorial doesn't cover and help you get started. You start off with one village and some stone and wood and as you rank up you earn 3 research points for every rank, until a few classes up you have to go through sub-ranks, which are basically the same thing only not as special, and as you get stronger you can control more villages that you either steal from other players at a massive honour penalty or you buy a village from charters which are rare, especially when the server is in the later stages, the more villages you have the higher the penalty or cost, charters are also more expensive the further they are away from the village you have selected. When building structures in your village each structure type is more expensive than the last and each structure takes longer to build oh and research, oh the research. Researching things imo is the most unforgiving part of this game, once you research something once it's complete you've got it, you can't get it back or anything. In addition to earning three points each time you rank up you can buy research points for gold which, again gets more expensive the more points you buy but there are researches that reduces the time it takes to build things and research tasks and researches that make buying points cheaper but you get the cheaper points later in the game, there are also cards that complete researches and buildings, make buildings and researches complete faster and give free research points. Armies probably should of been explained better imo, you start off with armed peasants which cost just about nothing to create, archers which are the only general use ranged unit, pikemen which try to clean out castles, swordsmen which rush straight for the center and catapults which sit there and hit the target you order them to, although catapults do deal out some nasty friendly fire. One tip i have when deploying armies is upgrade the troops you're using as much as you can since every upgrade exept captains and catapults upgrades their health, the catapult upgrade makes them fire faster and the captain upgrades make captain armies move faster and let you have more captains per village, i also reccomend getting the speed upgrade and as you expand get the army allowance upgrade. There are four currencies, gold which is generally used for creating troops and some structures, faith which is used with monks, honour which is used to rank up and crowns which are the paycash. On top of the four currencies there are four raw resource types, eight banquet resource types, six food types and five weapon types which are required to build every troop but captains and armed peasants. In addition to your army you have three non-combat units that you can use, scouts, monks and traders. Scouts can be used to scout enemy AI places and player villages and forage for resources which can be useful when you need resources and are running low, traders as the name suggests trade with parish capitals or they can be used to give resources to other players, while i haven't used monks myself they can be used to change votes, cure disease, increasing and decreasing popularity of villages in the parish and preventing attacks, aswell as of course removing these powers and removes the powers of churches. Although when training these units be warned, they run off the same population limit as your army and aswell as your troops they require peasants to train, unlike captains and villages though the more monks you have the cheaper they are. You increase the amount of each unit by research although unlike scouts and monks, the traders cap get increased based on how many markets you have, the limit of which is 10, each market will allow up to 5 traders. If you start you can't stop, in alot of cases you won't want to stop. The game runs in real time so you might get attacked by either an AI or a random player while you're off. Don't say off for too long though because you will get booted from the server from *ahem* idleness. The idle threshold goes up the higher your rank is, up to 2 months or if you have a premium token that lasts longer than your rank's idle time then the game will wait for that to expire before you get booted. Again, if you need help or advice don't be afraid to go on the Steam community hub, the SK offical forums, the guides or if you're lucky ask a player via the in-game chat. If anyone's interested in teaming up, my name is Hinsonator in game.",

Your use of the skill tree and placement of buildings can make a big difference in how well this game plays. Utilize your space wisely and don't randomly use up skill points. If you look at the skill tree map and see what opens up when, you can maximize your ability to do more things. There are codes that can be found to give you free stuff, which really helps. You DON'T have to spend money to really succeed in this game, but a few dollars here or there can make a tremendous difference without breaking the bank.   All in all, this game has been well worth the time I have put into it, and the $10 I spent would have been crapped out later from a Mc Donalds, so I don't feel bad about spending it on this instead. Give me another 100 hours and we'll see if I still feel the same way. As for now, a definite recommend!",

I don't expect something for free but I do expect a decent amount of gameplay and fun for a reasonable amount of money and this game is a mixed bag. I've dropped a little less than $10 and don't necessarily feel cheated. The problem is with other players, If you're surrounded by players dropping a lot of cash yo're in for a headache in the foraging portion of this game. When you see people swoping around at light speed and snatching up all the resources you might as well concetrate on your village or other ascpects of the game or lof out for a few hours until they go to bed or run out of cards. Whether you spend a little bit of money or none at all, thigs slow down conisderable as you level up with learning new skills taking up to 2-3 hours and building new bulidings up to 8 hours time. I often set things in motion and go do something for an hour or three (like writing a review for the game :D ) and come back and it's reading to do something else. Haven't gotten much into the MMO ascpect of the game as I'm on a Europen server surrounded by non-english speakers and I haven't gotten accepted into a guild yet. The economic system is fairly deep too.   If you are willing to spend about $10-$20 a month and don't mind slow game play, I'd definitly recommend this game. If neither apply to you, It'll still be enjoyable for about 20-30 hours of free play. Personally, I'm not going to spend any more $$ on it and see how it goes, I might be losing interest soon.",

While the game issues cards based on the level of your kingdom and doing a few quest like things, you'll not be able to recieve the full amount possible unless you conduct two separate microtransactions as item #4 on the list is buy some crowns. (at 5 dollars a pop minimum) So eventually you'll be only collecting 3 cards, while those that have had paid recieve 15 cards a week.  Making a second tier unit takes over 6 hours as the prerequisit bow has to crafted taking that long per bow. This makes building an army look like a colossal task. Of course if you pay and are lucky enough to get the right cards, you won't have to wait.  The villages can be destroyed completely by other players forcing you to restart elsewhere with no improvements on your new village.   The game world resets when some house(faction) reaches a high enough score. So what happens those armies you got by microtransactions?   If you don't start your kingdom within a short time the game restarts, you'll find yourself in a hut amongst skyscraping castles (metaphoricly).

The bad thing is you must do everything perfectly, research and build everything in proper order, otherwise you will find yourself with nothing to do for hours on end. Literally, as it can take more then a few hours to build a few buildings, or research stuff. And then, after the waiting is finally over, you realise you shouldn't have spent points on that at that moment, as now something else requires your attention, and you can't bring back neither the time, nor the points. This is probably the only MMO in my whole gaming career, that made me open another profile. And another one. And another one. And so on. I have literally spent over at least a thousand hours starting the game from scratch, and trying to be good at it, with at least a hundred different profiles. And in the end, I gave it up, as once I figured out the proper way of developing my kingdom, I was eaten alive by paying customers and their cards. This game wasn't a big waste of time and effort, it was actually HUGE. If the game was a one time fee only, with no cards involved, I would have bought it and would enjoy playing it, so I hope someone makes something similar in the future.",

The micro transactions allow them to make an unlimited amount of money off of you instead of just the flat rate that paying for a regular game would give them. Kind of like drugs. Some people want to be 'free' and take drugs because it's their life and they can do what they want with it, but it isn't really free, they get addicted and can't live without taking more drugs.

I am just started to play this game for like a week ago(was playing without steam that time, didn't know that its available via steam until now). I was wondering at start can i keep up with the others who have been playing for like years? But then as i launched the game i saw that they just launched a new fresh server where everyone really starts from a scratch or nothing. So right now i am really excited to play the game. Infact i am enjoying it now. Its a good game for you when you are busy with other stuffs to do like me (well you know, office work and so). Because the game runs slowly, you can still run the game smoothly while you do other activities, and it felt like half of your life was meant to be there lol. It was fine on my 1st and 2nd day playing that i got so many resources to build my village and castle as well as ranking up. Oh and there are also Faction and House Feature which adds some political taste to the game. For you who loves politics and having dreams of governing a country, you might aswell use this game for you to train yourself. Imagine, where else can you compete for a Precidency to rule over thousands of players?! xD There are also this House or Faction War where they fought each others between faction/houses. This part is the most appealing game feature. It made me felt like i as living on a world war Era which is epic. Anyway, overall it is a good game that i can recommend to you, make sure to try it at least a day  p.s. addiction guaranted (lol)  username : Your Hubby",

Coat of Arms, Character customization, and especially the Researching. I also love the players in this game (well, at least most of them). They're really friendly, and most of them will definitely help you when in a bad situation. Now, about the ideas. 1. I would really like to see some weapon stashes. Well, since weapons are really useful and hard to get for younger players, the weapon stashes could be REALLY rare. And scouts would be able to carry not a lot of them. 2. They could add a research, something that would increase health of the knights that ride out of the keep during a siege (of curse after 'Sally Forth' is researched). 3. An option of sending money to other villages would be a good idea. Same with Faith Points. 4. This game could use families. Marriages, brothers and sisters, cousins, daughters and sons. Players could trade and send reinforcements faster to their family members. 5. Some more weapons (and troop types of course) could be added. For example: crossbow (crosbowmen), maces (macemen)... 6. Ballistas for attacking could be added. They would be something like catapults, but they would shoot enemy troops (and have very powerful attack damage). 7. Some researches that would increase attack damage of troops could be added (for each one seperately).  There is also one thing that I don't like in this game- spawn rate of enemy siege camps and AI castles (especially Wolf's Castle). These things got really annoying. Once I beat one of them, another one spawns. Their spawn rate could be reduced.  This was my honest opinion about this game. My name is .WRF",

And while you are gone, you can set the game to auto trade, attack and scout. You constantly have something to do, and even when you are off, the game helps you continue.

Which can be unbenifical if you leave all the settings on because the AI is non-existant. I love this game. At first when I played it I was dissapointed because I was looking for a Stronghold game to get my fix. This is not that game if you are wondering. But, the online experience has been great and I have put hundreds of hours into this game. Building relationships with other people and enjoying the benefits of joining factions is spot on. Everyone I have incountered has been nothing but helpful to me. You start off with a small village and you can rise up to rule over parishes and even the country. I do recommend this game to those who love medival period games and plenty to do with a rich online experience that involves bulding real friendships among other gamers to reach a common goal.",
