You're able to control the character the way you like to. Even for pantsu shots for those kind of people ;P  training exercise is handy if you're new or rubbish beat 'em up games. leveling up your character is simply done, just get high enough combo and kill your enemy for maximum points. The background music suits the fast past of the game.  The problem I had though is that the enemies attacks are slow and predictable even on hard mode, I shoundn't be able to get a 200 combo chain on an enemy just by ONLY kicking them up in the air while his teamates are in the background making thier swords....sorry I mean sticks (when they hit you, it's like they attack you with a pillow)...shine brighter. A nightmare mode should fix this. The story also needs to be deeper, in these games, a story usually has a big role, but here, I'm more like 'Who are? Why should I care? Let me see your whities!' With also only 200Mb size, I'm guessing the game will be very short which will be a shame.  Besides that, the short amount of time I played, it is really inresting and fun game that its combat system makes a worth buy.  Like come! I BACKFLIPPED KICKED A GUY TO DEATH WHILE FLASHING PANTIES!!! WHAT OTHER INSENTIVE DO YOU NEED TO BUY! :P",

It has really nice graphics and combo's can get a bit of a finger-twister if you're using the keyboard, so the use of a controller is advised if possible. You can purchase costumes for your character ranging from the famous 'sailor' dress to traditional Japanese kiminos with points earned in-game.

            "review_text": "In short, this game is a generic hack and slash. It doesn't even try to hide it, the levels are arena like in nature, and enemies teleport into the arena and waves. (which begs the question, why not just all attack at once?) Typically, I'm a fan of these kinds of games, I enjoy the fast paced combat that they offer and the quick thinking required, and as much as I wanted to like this game, too many things kept me from my eventual ragequit (yes, I'll admit it, I ragequit). To start with, the combat itself is fairly bland, with very few in the terms of combos or special attacks, it boils down to alternating between mashing two different buttons however you feel like it. Combos are not based on a length of time, but rather how many hits you can get it in before you get hit. This isn't so much a downside as it is a personal preference; combos are more challenging and more entertaining when there's a time limit attached to them, to keep you in the fight for as long as possible. Some of the controls feel unintuitive, such as moving the control stick in any direction to use your directional attacks rather than your standard ones (this could be just me, as by habit I move towards what I'm attacking). The camera is sloppy, it positions itself how it feels and makes you have to constantly tweak it in order to watch out for attacks from other enemies, making it feel like you're playing two games at once, one that involves mashing buttons, and the other that involves photographing group pictures. While not particularly a downside, the amount of fanservice tends to be a bit much.  In short, its not the game for me, but someone out there is bound to enjoy it.",

You'll need to select the controller as 'Controller (Xbox360 Wireless receiver for Windows)' in the mitsurugi_config.exe, even if you're using a Sony SixAxis (that's how the motionjoy driver makes the SixAxis controller appear).  Anyway, once you've configured the game to run using your controller, it's much easier on your hands (but still be aware of repetitive stress injury, this game is way too addictive, and so cute!).   The controls are well thought out, but there's quite a variety of things to learn so be sure to understand the tutorial first. It'll give you lots of ideas on how to get past the bosses. Pay special attention to how to recharge your health (the top bar). And don't forget to spend the skill points you earn to upgrade the power of your attacks (I got pretty far without realizing that, but it was very slow-going indeed!). Normal difficulty is probably sufficiently hard unless you've played these kinds of games a lot before.  Overall, this is the kind of well-thought-out fighting game mechanic that should have been emulated in games like 'Remember Me' (which has an almost insanely-confusing gameplay mechanic compared to this jewel of a game).",

            "review_text": "What's there not to recommend about this game?  girlXgirl action ✓  Lots of pantsu fanservice ✓   Infact, it's similar to DMC.  However, this game suffers from 2 critical flaw.  1) THERE IS NO TARGETING/LOCKON SYSTEM. well actually there is one but it's only for the bosses. 2) TOO MUCH POSING.   Well now, let me explain how these 2 flaws will actually affect gameplay.  Without a targeting system, basically whichever direction you face is where your attacks will hit. This flaw does not affect your gameplay in Easy, Normal or Hard. I mean the waves after waves of enemies don't consecutively have a go at you non-stop. You could always adjust your camera direction to have your enemies in view. Well at least you have the time. BUT once you reach Very Hard or Inferno, that's when adjusting camera angle to keep your enemies in view becomes a ♥♥♥♥♥. Besides dashing around continously to avoid getting hit by the non-stop attacks of your enemies, you must adjust Misa's direction just to actually hit enemies. And take note, the time frame you have to adjust is about a split second, which you must at the same time release a combo of attacks before dashing off again.   As for the posing flaw, well I wouldn't call it a flaw. More like she poses too much after some giant combo attack. The developers probably thought, 'Hey why not add in some cool poses whenever she does a combo attack so that she looks cool and all'. The posing as usual doesn't affect gameplay much in easy, normal and hard. Unless you suck and mess up the combo attacks timing and leave yourself open to attacks since Misa can't actually move while posing. So how does this affect Very Hard? Well couple in together with the lack of a targeting system, having to manually target waves of enemies in a split second, your bound to not get them all during 1 of your big combo attacks. Which in turns come to you getting attack the next instant while your posing.  So unless there's some sort of update with at least a targeting/lockon system, I wouldn't recommend getting this game at it's original price. But if it's at a discounted price and you have the spare cash, then yea, why not.",

It's a really fast, but generally repetative action game with a whole lot of really flashy sword combat going on. I mean, there's not really anything else to say.  I should note that it takes some time to get into since the game has progression system in which you unlock your abilities, and your basic attacks aren't too interesting.  I'm really neither here nor there when it comes to 'recommending' this game, but it's decent for what it is. If the trailer interests you, the game probably will, but keep in mind that the trailer is showing off nearly everything the game has to offer.  The only thing you won't really gather form the trailer is the game's difficulty. It can be a real challenge on the higher difficulties, and you'll really have to have the game's mechanics down to survive through the highest difficulty setting.   I should also mention. The game plays much better with a controller than with a keyboard.",

The actual fighting is quite good, though it's limited to the same circular arena with different backgrounds, but once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly fun despite being rather simplistic. On that note, the game does seem to spike wildly between insultingly easy and frustratingly difficult.   There is a story, but it's the typical cliched anime nonsense, nothing special, but that's typical if games in this area. The graphics, while not mind blowing, are very well done overall, though the environments are completely barren outside of the backdrop of each stage. The music is fairly standard as well, but it fits the action well enough.   And of course there's the fanservice. Oh, the fanservice. Should that really make me like it more? No. But I'd be lying if I said it didn't.  For 10 bucks, you could certainly do a lot worse that Mitsurugi.",

(although you might get lucky if you smash your keyboard hard enough).  The fighting mechanics are fluid as each of your attacks have a variety of branches at the end of each which allow you to hack and or smack your way into the triple digit combo's within 20 seconds, when you begin the game you are quite limited to not much with only various combo's, the unlock list isn't entirely technical and there isn't hundreds of complicated skills you need frustrate yourself over the complicated longer attacks are easy to execute and the game provides adequate tutorials to help you understand how to use them, (although some of the button symbols may confuse you).  so far I have sunk 10 hours into this game within 2 days and while it still has a few flaws which include very rare bugs which mean you can take 3/4 of the end bosses hp with one super attack on hard mode it is very polished, the mechanics are fluid and the attack methods are simple, Sure this is a game where you can mash on normal difficulty when the AI is a little slow and wont attack much, but as soon as you step into harder difficulties you'll really start to enjoy the game a lot more.

I love the design, the gameplay (alltough playing with a keyboard is kinda hard, at least at the beginning) and even the story,alltough it's kinda simple! The summer sale makes it even better because you only Pay 2.49€ (Dunno the price in $) Its one on the better games on Steam!",

Cutting and slashing stuff was fun and I love the sword play in this game, as it feels a lot like Vergil from DMC3. I did have some problems with the camera and targeting system, dying quite a few times to a boss because of it. Yeah, it was kind of a big deal. So for the money spent I got what I thought I would: A solid hack-and-slash game that's more of a stress killer than a thought provoker. Action is great, characters are hot and the satisfaction level is high. The only thing to make this better would be updates for the camera and maybe more costumes or weapons.",

Then this game likes you too! Fanservice everywhere.   The Bad: -Controls are ♥♥♥♥. Usually the norm to pause a game on PC is to press Esc but, the pause button for this game is the enter key. Even when you try to rebind stuff, it is confusing as hell. You spend about half the time trying to configure the controls and figure out how to try and combo your moves. Trying to click on the title screen and pressing ESC to pause the game are going to annoy the hell out of you. -Tutorial sucks. They tell you to do a certain move that you have no idea what button to press nor what to do. They pretty much leave you by yourself trying to figure out what to do. -The battle 'cries and attacks' are repetitive and you get tired of her just yelling the same thing over and over. You can slash your opponents until they are red then sheathe your sword until they die (WDF?) -AI is garbage. They circle around you and attack occasionally (depending on level of difficulty and how far you are), which are pretty easy to dodge and move away from. -Hack and Slash game. This part is somewhat bias of myself for I do no enjoy Hack and Slash games that much. However on this game in particular, trying to chain attacks on this game is not fluid at all.  This game has so much potential if they can fix the cons about this game.",

And, well, sword-wielding females making up the main cast. MKH merely lacks them wearing all but a bikini and a ten gallon.  For a doujin title, its rather respectable. Again: for a doujin title. The interface has a bit of tack to it and, as I said, the battle system doesnt feel as tight as it could have been. You are tasked with fighting things before fighting things and then fighting maybe other things before getting a boss fight. Who you fight. My main gripe with said fighting was how easy it is to trigger annoying, weak, inappropriate and, most importantly, slow to recover attacks without meaning to do so. I feel like that could have been easily avoided by having them only activate with another independent button -- a lock-on, for example.  The difficulty isnt to be sniffed at either, bosses in particular will be quick to whittle away if you dont wise up quick enough and its surprisingly easy to get stunlocked by mere mobs (another negative trait shared with the Onechanbara series). With no means to cheese enemies via a ranged attack or super mode featuring health regen the latter battles on higher difficulties can become a test of mettle more than anything.  Its a good little slasher and a fine example of what can come out of Comiket, just dont go in expecting a perfectly polished experience.",

Though it is on sale now at only $2 bucks or so, i'd say it's definitely worth more than the $10 price tag its given.  Mechanics:  Looking at the game overall, it's pretty simple. The mechanics involve combos (and i'd definitely recommend using a controller for the full experience + vibration support) which chain up with other skills that you'll purchase along the way from skill points given (by killing enemies). The game doesn't have a bazillion combos as one would expect but rest assured there's something satisfying about how polished the attacks are on such a simple game.   I think the only downside for the game mechanics is that the arenas are all the same. You'll enter one arena, fight a few wave of enemies, a mini-boss, then move on to the next arena which looks pretty similar to the previous one other than the last two.   Side note: It's not said in the tutorials but take note that when upgrading some of the skills you have beyond level 1, they will unlock new moves within that attack (which are awesome).   Story:  It's a cheesy story. I wouldn't expect one to critisize this game for having a simple one because it's such a simple game and I think it fits in nicely with the mechanics and scale of the story.   Overall:  9/10 - Great game for the price and it's extremely polished for such a simple game. Though it doesn't have the best story or game arena aesthetics, it makes up for mechanics that allow a lot of replayability.  TL;DR - It's about $2 right now, WHY NOT?",

On higher difficulties, and with more upgrades, the game becomes a magic-spamming luckfest. In the early stages, it has far more interesting combos.  Essentially the plot of the game is, you are a schoolgirl, fighting motorcycle helmetted dudes in suits. I think they're supposed to be robots...which are spawned by a demon sword, which is used by your best friend.  Pros: Boss fights - on inferno. You can live out your sword wielding schoolgirl fantasy. Pantsu. Very satisfying perfect guard/flourish. Very difficult timing. Sheathing the sword is badass (and also is your strongest attack, provided you have max zeal).  Cons: Higher diff's and non-boss waves are a lot of 'run in circles, spam one button, finisher, run in circles'. Zero story. Zero stage variation. Last boss is impossible if you don't flourish, a joke if you do. Fairly grindy level up system.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for a decently challenging arcade style game. Its basically a lower investment DMC/Bayonetta. More technical (fewer parry frames) than those games however, and more punishing. The bottom line is, I had fun playing it, and if you see it on sale for cheap, its worth a buy.  Hint: learn to flourish early. If you don't, good luck on inferno.  BIG HINT: If you are used to leaning the stick towards the enemy,  do not buy sonic slash or flash kick . These change your combo while moving, into a (imo) incredibly bad combo. Sonic slash has a HUGE afterswing delay, tiny hit stun, and is strictly worse than the standard sword combo. Flash kick sets up an aerial combo...which is just bad. Stay on the ground people. You have been warned. There is NO way (aside from starting a new game) to remove these upgrades once you purchase them.",

A big circle for the arena, backgrounds change but aren't that impressive. The story barely exists, your friend has an evil sword and you want to save her. Done, whatever, moving on. Controls are finicky, playing this game on a mouse and keyboard is impossible. It's designed for a controller and nothing but. The tutorial and interface are also a problem, they tell you to hit certain attacks without button prompts.  All that aside, when you do have a controller and know how things work, things get fun. The system allows for a lot of insane combos and bouncing around. You can block, but it's actually better not to since it kills the flow. Bosses are insanely hard and become a lot of fun if that sort of challenge doesn't aggrevate you. Enemies start off from peons you step on to to behemoths that pose a fair challenge in their own right. Difficulty spikes up quickly enough to keep things interesting.  For me, the buy was worth it based on the art and gameplay. It doesn't price itself too high so it's worth it if you like these sorts of games. Getting it on sale is fine, but you can't argue with an asking price of $15 for this level of challenge.",

Well what do you expect from a hack n slash about anime girls? -Extremely short campaign. I've beaten the whole thing multiple times on the hardest difficulty and I still only have 2 hours logged. My first play was about 45 minutes in length -A bit too easy. Even on the hardest difficulty few if any of the enemies pose a serious threat to a skilled player -Very small 'arenas' for each stage rather than a full level. In each of these arenas designed to look like some location or another you see small snippets of the story in a cutscene, fight a few waves of enemies and then fight a boss. Very simple; but not necessarily a bad thing.  In summation: get it if you enjoy hacking and slashing, but wait until its on super sale, like 50-75% off would be fine.",

Basically the levels are sealed arenas like the Bloody Palace mode in Devil May Cry games.  The soundtrack is ok, but it has only 3 songs and they get quite repetitive. After two hours I just switched the music off and went to my Metal Gear Risng and Devil May Cry soundtrack folders.  Gameplay and controls... controls are quite responsive and fast, you won't feel some sloppy reactions to your inputs. The gameplay is rather repetitve. No, you have different moves and techniques like blocking at the last moment to block a very powerful attack (similar to Royal Guard style from DMC3), different cancels, launcher attacks, dodges, but after finding a combo that is most effective for your playing style it all becomes quite repetitve.  All in all... it feels incomplete, like a tech demo. It's fun, don't get me wrong, but I would love to see these gameplay mechanics to be expanded in a more 'complete' character action game.  Oh, and it can get quite difficult at times, especially on the final boss. Also, don't start at Hard mode, it exists as a NG+ type of mode, when you really need your upgraded skills.",

Judge the game for what it is; a bad ♥♥♥ hack and slash meant to be played when you're bored and you want to slice things to pieces. That's how all hack and slashes are. The learning curve isn't very steep since once you get the hang of the combos and counters it becomes enjoyable. I love unlocking everything in the game. It feels so rewarding getting a 500+ combo hit on the hardest difficulty without getting hit once. I think I have like one achievement left in the game. Either way, I'd still play it again because it's a great hack and slash and probably the only indie game that I found truly enjoyable. I hope they localize more Japanese indie games in the future. So, if you want to see a chick slice dudes up with a long ♥♥♥ katana buy this game. Also, to those who are somehow unaware of how hack and slashes are; they ALL are a mass of repeating themselves over and over again.
