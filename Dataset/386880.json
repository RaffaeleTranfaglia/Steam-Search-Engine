            "review_text": "After two long hours of trying to outwit this gangly coward in a dense forest with everything from camera pigs to obscene language, I stumbled upon the ruins of its chalet up in a narrow mountain pass. There I found a sniper rifle, almost as if that's what it was planning to screw me over with next. I took that sniper rifle and, that night, baited the creature into a barren basin at the foot of a hill where I shot it half to death as it ran around screeching in pain and baffled rage. It eventually fled back to my camp where it murdered my pet pig out of spite before I blew its face open ten feet from the treeline it was attempting to ambush me from. I had a wonderful time with Rake but you know, I wouldn't have done if I didn't have to suffer its outrageous failings first. If this was anything approaching a competent experience with well tuned mechanics, I'd have killed that yellow little freak in like ten minutes and forgot all about it. But I will remember this. I will remember the joy of plugging it full of lead from a hunting blind as it sprinted from one end of the hill to the other, wondering where its tactics had failed it. Sometimes to kill a monster, you have to play one.  Check out the hunt below.         YouTube™ Video:  The Fragnostic vs. RAKE | 2015 | PC HORROR GAME&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "Me and a friend of mine decided we'd play this at the same time since there's no Multiplayer yet. So allow me to summarize both of our experiences.  My expedition;  NIGHT 1 First 2 minutes are all quiet, nothing happening, Cam 4 picks up movement, I click on it and see two blaring eyes running towards the camera and I see the monster as it rips my camera to shreds. I think to myself 'What the fresh hell?! I thought the reviews said this ♥♥♥♥ only happend on the 3rd night!' two more cameras are taken down in the time frame of 5 or 6 minutes, and I periodically peer through the windows of my camper to see if it's out there, to afraid to go out after he's already done so much damage in so little time. 11 minutes have passed since I began the night, and now I hear the sound of footsteps off to the left of Cam 1, which is located right outside the Camper, over-looking the camp site, followed by the sounds of a hog squealling and then some horrible screech followed by slashing noises and then it's all quiet.. the rest of the night is spent panicking in the RV as I look out my windows and remaining cameras, even though the monster decides he's had his fun and phones it in.  The day after there's a dead pig right next to the cage outside my camper, nothing else, other than a couple pools of blood scattered across the forest.  NIGHT 2 First 2-3 minutes is all quiet, then the same ♥♥♥♥ happens where I see it mauling one of my far out cameras. I quickly switch to Cam 4 which is in just the right spot that I can turn it enough to see it attacking Cam 5. I decide 'I've got my gun and night-vision binocs, time to see if I can take him down!' I decide he'll likely attack Cam 4 now, since it's within the immediate area of Cam 5, I run all the way out there, expecting to see it... it's not there, and my camera is still functional. I panic, because I know it sees me, and I don't want to try to run back to my Camper, I'd be even more screwed in there than I am out here in that small closed coffin on wheels, unless he miracously didn't track me back there. So I walk slowly back towards my camp, hoping to use the pig in the cage as an early warning system, and then have that 'nice' lazy man's campfire light in the middle of the camp to help me see it... that didn't happen. I heard it to my left and it lept out of a bush and painted the trail with my blood.. shooting it seemed to just ♥♥♥♥ it off..  My friends' expedition;  NIGHT 1  Nothing happens.. seriously.. zip nada zilch.  Next day however there's a dead pig right outside his Camper  NIGHT 2  Same thing as Night 1... he's so much more damn lucky it would appear  When he wakes up this time however, there's 3 pig heads mounted on sticks right outside his Camper. He's quite shaken up now.  NIGHT 3  He's peering through the cameras, and thinks he heard something on his Camper. He pulls out his gun after leaving the cameras, and the monster bursts through the window by the door and kills him.   Game's rating;  10/10 will never go camping again  (I'll update this review once Multiplayer becomes a thing)  UPDATE (12/29/15)  Multiplayer is out, but you'll need to watch a video on it. Sorry, I tried to host a server following the instructions with Hamachi, and neither I or my friend could get it to work, so I have no idea what the experience is like. Sorry again =(",

I can already see the graphics aren't the best and the gameplay mechanics are very simplistic. Those aren't the problem. The game is only five dollars anyway.  THE BIG PROBLEM.  The AI is literally too easy. The pigs and deers were harder to kill and hit than the actual Rake. The Rake will jog towards you and you can hear it a mile away. Just aim and shoot and it scatters off in the distance for a few seconds. Then it comes jogging back. Repeat, and repeat and it dies. So... Hopefully they can fix the AI or improve it, or something. Otherwise I can't recommend it. It didn't even jump in the trees or anything. That is my biggest problem with the game. The AI is a bore. If they patch it or improve it within this game, I will certaintly recommend this game.  As of now, it's a no. &lt;-- OLD  EDIT*  The developers are working on this, I guess. There's no major co-op mode yet, or multiplayer. I can say that the game is much better if you play it like this: Night 1 don't go hunting, Day 2 go sight seeing, Night 3 fight!   I had a lot of fun editing this video that I made, this game is only five dollars (Still 2 dollars more than what I think it should be worth) and has some interesting ideas. The AI has improved a little bit, but would still like to see a lot of changes since this game does have quite a bit of potential. Would I recommend this?

Until this game was optimized it resembled a half finished painting done by Picasso with his ♥♥♥♥, but after the recent updates, it started looking like a game, something I could engage in some daily foreplay with. The Rake however still resembles Smeagol either in heat or seeing each camera as the Ring to rule them all and is engaging in violent coitus.  Deep in the jungles I went, thinking it was going to be a thriller much like Predator but turned into a steaming pile of Favela's Great Big Hunt meets the Thornberry's as I was finding myself pouring wild feed into a cage to capture myself a wild Boar, strapping a camera onto it, and at night releasing it to the wild. It was like a Paris Hilton sextape; Skinny, somewhat attractive looking species looking into the camera in nightvision, with a sweaty, greasy hog like man creature being taken advantage of. It was then at that moment I witnessed first hand account of Rake ♥♥♥♥♥♥, Raking if you must.  2 cameras down, I sprawled up from my Trailer Bat Cave, climbed out and onto my roof in search of the dreaded creature that took my piggies life. Quoting Arnold here ' You Ugly Mother ♥♥♥♥er' I shot twice in the direction of its asscheeks, thinking I won, that I a man and his rifle had caught and or killed the infamous Rake... but I was mistaken. I shot instead Bambi's mother.  This game is terrifying as it is heart breaking.

Spoilers, if you don't want to know what happens, don't read this. Morning 1 - I take in my surroundings, explore the place and put in some cameras. Night 1 - Not much happens, I check my cameras throughout the night, not daring to go out. Morning 2 - I see a corpse of a pig near the cage, thinking it was my pig. I check the cameras, finding out it was a different one. Night 2 - I see a new corpse of a pig nearer my trailer. Still not my pig.. Still no sign of the creature Morning 3 - I walk out my trailer, to find pig heads impaled on spears all across my camp. I feel terrified now, and I check my cameras, my pig is still alive. But one of my cameras are out, so I place a new one. Night 3 - (It goes DOWN) I check my cameras (still too much of a wuss to go outside) still there are pig heads, but when I turn to my trailer, I see a gruesome sight, human and pig limbs are stuck all over my trailer. I become extremely worried. Then.. my cameras begin going out one by one, and then my pig is killed. I only have 2 cameras left, one far off and one right outside my trailer, I pray that it'll go for the one far off. I look through the one outside my trailer (Cam 1) And I see it... running past into the bushes, I scream. Then, the worst thing happens... Camera 1 goes out.. and im stuck with one last camera... the one far away. I can't bring myself to push E and come out of the cameras, but I finally do it. I look around my trailer then the unspeakable happens, he breaks right through my window, I scream the loudest I've ever screamed in years. But when I find im not dead, I feel better, I then see he only takes a small amount of health off me. I stay in my trailer, still too much of a wuss to go out. Then I see him outside the broken window, I shoot at him, screaming. He runs off, never to be seen again... Then I lose. I recommend this game, it was an amazing and terrifying experience.",

The game may run out of things to do and become repetitive, but with a multiplayer upate on the way, and great atmosphere, it has lots of potential and is worth the current price in my opinion. The rake itself may not be scary after several encounters, and learning his AI patterns is very easy, but when he catches you off guard or you don't know his location, that's when the game shines. I say give it a shot and see what it has to offer in the future, and I think the content is worth the price, but in its current state, I wouldn't say it's worth more than $10, but still offers a good enough experience to be worth it.",

He took a couple swipes and destroyed it, so I left the safety of the trailer to go investigate. I had my map up, when I notice out of the corner of my eye a dead pig lying on the ground. I equipped my rifle and started looking around. I hear a quick pitter-patter of footsteps, and turn around. We make eye-contact, and he knocks me over and runs off. The hunt was on.

I'v always been a huge fan of supernatural things and cryptids so I knew I had to try this. And boy, I don't regret that one bit. The camera system is really well made, the creature can be terrifying and the nights make your heart race. This game has A LOT of potential, (not that it isn't good already) but as this gets updated more and more I believe this game will eventually shine.  When I started playing, I wasn't too impressed by the enviorment and the sounds, but when nighttime came, all that changed. I became so immersed and and frightened that I wasn't able to leave the truck at all. And when I finally did, the Rake is god damn terrifying. It's so dark at nights, and the Rake is so fast and unpredictable that those 2 things combined make the nights all out horror at least for me.  All and all this game is definitely worth the 4€.

(Although clearly taking insparation from FNAF.) -The Rake can destroy the cameras, and when it does, holy sh*t.  -The Rake climbs trees and jumps from them.  -Camera on the pig is hilarious.    And that's about it...  CONS:  -Poorly optimized. I have a below average laptop yet CS:GO runs better. (And that has much better graphics, more on that now.) -Graphics are very poor. On 'Very Low' settings, the grass is comepletely gone, and albeit the game is colourful, it definently needs colour correction. It is overall way too bright and staturated.  -Cameras can only be placed on set locations. This HUGELY dissapointed me. And the locations were you can place them are not varied enough, there are roughly 4 cameras that you can place near your camp, and like, 20 to the north-east of the map. -Scripted encounters during the day and night, but only in a couple of locations, which are scary but feel too cheap. -The Rake looks terrible. He resembles nothing like the Creepypasta version, and needs spike arms! That would already be a good improvement. It's texture is very poor, which makes it less scary. -When you kill it, literrally all you receive is a 'You Win!' message at the top of the screen. -HUD is below average, but nothing terrible.  -Decent price, but the map is not randomly or proccedurally generated, therefore you get the same experience every time you play. -No tutorial.   And the thing that bothers me the most has got to be:  =STOCK ASSETS FROM THE UNITY ENGINE. STOCK ASSETS FOR F*CKS SAKE. If you are going to MAKE a game, do NOT, I repeat DO NOT use stock assets! ARE YOU CRAZY?! That is litterally one of the most lazy things that you can do when making a game.  Sorry about the rant.  Conclusion:  At this point, unfortunatly I simply cannot recommend the game. It's poor grahics, very low replayability and no tutorial to speak of, and of course, *Ahem*, STOCK ASSETS, I see no good reasons to give this game, a thumbs up.

Ending up with so many cameras, my camera counter went past 99 and broke itself at 10 permanently.  Turning to face him with my lovely cargo shorts filled to the bulging brim with shoddy electrical equipment, I found my friend clutching a shotgun and staring with unflinching terror at an old CRT television screen which was nothing but snowflake static.  I ask where my gun was, and he said there was only one. I asked what to do next then, to which he replied. 'Go outside and set up cameras.'  I walked outside armed with my assortment of ♥♥♥♥ cameras and NOTHING ELSE. And proceeded to place them on the trees. Whistling the Tetris theme to myself. 'This game isn't too scary. It's just dark!' I thought. But after placing the 4th camera down, I heard footsteps. And not normal footsteps, they were turbo footsteps. Footsteps so fast, it sounded like someone was chasing me through the power of tapdancing.  I hardly have time to react before my screen is locked onto what could only be described as a slimy Old Benjamin Button with sausage fingers, screeching in my face and delivering a nasty pimp-slap to my virgin cheek.  I scream out in horror, and my friend is cackling like a madman over the mic. Before I can ask him what's so godamn funny, I hear Sammy Davis Jr. tapping his way over to me again. I try my damndest to run, but alas I get another brutal backhand and a firm groping.  Upon recovering, I frantically try to navigate home, before yet again I hear the rampant stomps of Edward Sausage-hands. I try running but of course he smacks me again. And then another time after that. ♥♥♥♥ finding my way home. I just need to RUN.  After crying like a wet ♥♥♥♥♥ I bolted into the forest leaving a trail of misery, blood and most certainly urine as the tapdancing kept following me, however it finally subsided and I hid in the world's smallest treehouse. At this point me and my friend were both gasping for air, however for different reasons. He had nearly given himself a stroke while laughing, whearas I had my lungs rearranged to my anal cavity by the rampaging scrotum monster.  'I was watching that ♥♥♥♥ing thing smack you around the entire time' He delivered through girlish giggles, the sound of which would haunt my dreams. As I was now effectively lost.  30 minutes of wandering finally got me back to the site, and I rushed into the van, and cut my friend a cold stare for a while. 'Why don't you go? You have the gun!' I asked, frustrated and still in a dire need of new underwear at that point.  'Because I'm scared'  And to think he wanted to be in the army.  After slapping him around a bit, I finally convinced him to come WITH me on my IT department runs, where we just frolicked through the forest, planting cameras on all the good little trees. Everything was fine until...    We heard IT.   The footsteps rapidly approached, and in our view were 2 piercing white eyes, speeding towards us. In a mixture of high pitched adult baby screams, my friend finally used his boomstick, loading 2 rounds between the ♥♥♥♥er's eyes and dropping him, it let out a loud squeal of agony before going quiet.  The stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s had shot a pig.  After having a moment of silence for our late friend Wilbur, we hastilly ran up the trail to a house. Where I finally got my own shotgun with 2 bullets and nothing else. Then the Silent Hill jumpscare descended through a crack in the roof, shaking me around violently before jumping away quickly.  The greasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stole my only 2 bullets.  Now armed with nothing but cameras and a walking stick with a trigger on it, I followed my friend around the forest. And this is where the game got bad.  We went to the ravine.  There was no Rake.  We went to the scary waterfall cave that made a bunch of disgusting loud noises.  All we found was a toaster and a battery.  We went to the swamp.  It smelt like ♥♥♥♥.  After about 45 minute of wandering, the mood shifted from fear to tedium as we were just begging for the Rake at this point. Stripping off our clothes and gyrating our hips while lathering ourselves in BBQ sauce and screaming memes out into the darkness. (Memes of course being the mating call for the typical jumpscare)  However it didn't show. And we just wandered, searching high and low for anything cool. Eventually we found some kind of dungeon building that had heavilly eroded, being the brave soul I am, I went first. Where I was then cutscene'd to the ground TWICE by the half digested Xenomorph before it ♥♥♥♥ed off for good.  After dusting myself off and getting rid of the super wedgie it gave me, I turned to see my friend holding a Sniper rifle he had just looted from the building while I still had no ammo and very little health.  Looks like I know who I'm not inviting to my birthday parties anymore.  After all that, our final stop was a grimy shack, where I found beartraps. A ♥♥♥♥ ton of them. Which I then immediately started to place around the area for safety. After taking one long look at the now fortified site, I saw my friend walk over one. (The same one we both walked over 20 times) and he suddenly died. Flopping forward and not moving at all.  Unmotivated to leave and try to find his respawn point, I started to stack bear traps like Jigsaw's version of Jenga. Until suddenly one of the traps sprang from the stack, embedding itself in my groin and killing me instantly.    Our bodies were never recovered.    All in all this game was fun for a little while with a buddy, then it was just extremely buggy because the Rake got stuck on trees, bushes, cars, lamps, or particularly thick chunks of absolutely nothing. Very little ammo to go around, no day/night cycle, and pretty much no reason to play for more than 10 minutes. Once you start to feel bored, that means there's literally nothing else to experience. For 5 bucks I shouldn't complain much, but then again, I've seen more funtional Alpha builds that were more enjoyable selling themselves for like 99 cents.",

            "review_text": "So i dont do reviews for games, infact this is my first time so ill just state it as is the videos and screenshots made it seem like it was going to be more of a survival game but it is just set up camera, watch camera, shoot creature (if lucky enough to find it), repeat. It isnt very fun and the controls are wonky and make the game even more boing than it already is. I played for a total of 31 minutes but 10 of which consisted of a loading screen, when the game started it has marked locations where you are restricted to put the camera and puting a camera on a pig is difficult as you have to wait for it to walk into the cage and than wait for its head to be at a certian angle or it wont recognise that it is able to be attached. all in all the graphics are poor at best, the gameplay is boring and repeatitive, the controls are horrid making the game more of a hassle and irritation to play instead of enjoyable like a game is supposed to be. do not reccomend this game i wish i could as the idea of the game is very interristing and sounds like it would be fun to play but it is not.  TLDR- the game is complete ♥♥♥, the controls such and graphics are ♥♥♥♥ do not reccomend it. get a different game instead of wasting 5$ on this.",
