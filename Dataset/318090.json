            "review_text": "Dicetiny is fun little game for when you're bored and want to kill some time. It's a mix of Hearthstone and Monopoly (although it doesn't take you years to finish one round). The Card design is mostly based on Internet Memes and Movie References which might not appeal to everyone. While playing the game there were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way:  -I do enjoy some funny Memes but the Story Mode sometimes trys waaaaay to hard to fit in some stupid references that aren't funny -Balancing is an issue cause some of the Cards seem vastly OP while others seem straight up useless -The game doesn't really have any replayability because starting with a different class for your main-character doesn't add anything to the experience since you can just switch to one of the side-character and you'll pretty much know what the other classes offer. -There are no unlocks for beating the game other than some achievments -For a cardgame of this day and age to have no multiplayer is kind of wierd especially when everything in the game screams loudly 'WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO EXPERIENCE SOME OF THIS WITH FRIENDS?!' -Some of the missions aren't explained all that well ,for example when it says 'You win the game when your enemy has no Gold' you can just straight up kill them and win that way and in some missions It's even the way better option to do so. -Lastly at the date of this Review there is a Glitch in this game that makes the information of a field show up and not dissapear you can't get rid of it for the rest of the match so you'll have to restart the whole mission to make it go away.  All in all eventhough the game has a lot of wasted potential, it's still fun for a quick singleplayer playthrough, definetly worth picking up should it be on Sale.",

Lots of attention to useless things like ATK means attack and no attention to the core mechanics. Tried playing for a bit but not intuitive at all. May try again unless I'm busy cleaning the grout in the bathroom with a warped toothbrush.",
