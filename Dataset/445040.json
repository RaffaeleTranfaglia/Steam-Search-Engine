You gotta track down seven cunning evil serpents before they can warn an evil wizard that you're crossing his cursed kingdom to kill him. Art style is simple but gorgeous. And this is the most deeply nonlinear and complexly-plotted piece of interactive fiction I've ever seen. Awesome.",

The story, structure, flow and feel is so spot on for this series.  Highly recommended, buying part 4 when it's out",
