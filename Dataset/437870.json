            "review_text": "For those of you who enjoy resource games like Banished or Planet Base this is the game for you. It posseses many of the same features but taken to the next level. The layers of crafting are farily intricate. In addition you have the added dimension of a research tree and the problem of managing 3 colonies at a time where each colony is interdependant on the others. Throw that together with the threat of robbers and aliens and you have a game that will keep you entertained for hours. At the beginning of the game you have 'advisors' they do a great job at stepping you through some of the beginning phases but the mechanics are designed where you need to be increasingly more creative. This system allows you to jump right into playing the game with a very easy learning curve. If you don't want to be constrained by the story they also have a sandbox mode. All in all I think this is the best resource game I have played. I think it better even then banished or planet base. One last thing the price point on this game is well worth it. Buy it you'll love it.",

This almost seems like someone had an idea for a decent Tapping Game on a mobile platform and then decided to turn it into a bare-bones PC port. This game, so far, seems to be nothing more than clicks. Want to make resources? Click to make one of ANYTHING, but you only get one per click, so if you want 40, click 40 times. Or you can just turn on automation and it will keep making things ad infinitum. There's no 'process' to make anything. It's just clicks. You don't have to send out astronauts to mine ore, you don't have to extract anything from the soil. Well, maybe you do theoretically, but if you want to go that route, it's all in your imagination.  Want to build the more complicated buildings? Just wait til the automated counters tick up and build one when you have enough supplies.  I'm renaming this Earth Space Colonies: Click and Wait.",

            "review_text": "TLDR; While the story is lacking, the mechanics are decent enough that I would recommend this if you get it for &lt; $5. I would not pay $15 for this game because it lacks long term replayability that you can find in games like Banished.     Now for those of you who don't mind reading.....  My mom and I each picked this game up when it was on sale and it was definitely a good buy for the price we paid.  We love Banished and while I can say that this does not have the replayability of Banished (in my opinion I could see MAYBE playing it through two or three times, whereas Banished has much much more replayability), it did entertain me for an evening or two.  The crafting system is simple, click what raw materials you want or let the auto production go crazy, I ended up doing a bit of both. For more refined products, you could only click to add more.   You get to make 3 interconnected colonies on 3 different planets/moons. I liked how they were interconnected crafting-wise, however I wish the stories had also been connected in some way.  I thought the story would be a bit lengthier than it was, but it was decent. Each colony had a different story line I found Mar's story to be the most fleshed out, however the dialogue and VO is a bit... unnatural. Ceres' story was shorter and shallower but the dialogue flowed better than on Mars. The last planet had a SUPER short story and seemed to be the most 'important' one scientifically but because of the VO it seemed more like a pat on the back instead of a true celebration of the achivement you supposedly make.    There is a sandbox mode and a survival mode. The defense mechanics in the game aren't quite fleshed out enough to be compelling for a survival mode. The sandbox mode has possible replayability, however I never ended up playing the sandbox mode since it is exactly the same as story mode, except there are no objectives or story.",
