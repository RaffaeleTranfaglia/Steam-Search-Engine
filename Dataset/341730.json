            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game because I enjoyed Choplifter as a kid but a few issues really dragged down the fun out of it for me.   -odd controls. L and R for left and right, hold both to ascend and let go to decend. Would rather just use the joystick to move and two fave buttons to ascend and decend instead.  -super touchy collision. If your heli gets turned slightly the wrong way boom you're dead.  -extra unlockable helis actually control *worse*. Yes they may have more person capacity and a higher health bar but controls are even more touchy than before especially on higher stages going into caverns and whatnot where space is tight.  -you have to land *extremely* softly. Otherwise you lose a ton of health or worse yet- you explode.   I do like the voxel graphics though. Music and the pilot chatter are nice additions as well. The touchy and weird controls along with poor heli selections just kill the fun.",

            "review_text": "This game, (For those of you who don't know) was and still is a mobile game. It was ported, but it got updates to it so you can keybind and all that goodness. I do sort of like it, but I wouldn't play through all 25 levels unless it was the only game I had installed and had no internet. The controls are a bit clunky when turning because it turns you SO for over that you can sometimes crash into a tree without going very far up first. To go straight up, you have to press your laft and right buttons at the same time. The shooting is a little odd felling if you have your keys binded to for right on your keyboard, unless you have auto mode on. I give this game a 5/10 because I kind of want a refund. (ERGH STEAM)",

The game itself is sort of fun, though you can tell it is clearly a mobile port. It's on sale right now for $.59 and totally worth that, but I'm not sure about the normal 4 dollar price tag.",
