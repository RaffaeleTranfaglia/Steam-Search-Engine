But honestly, you dont need to spend a dime on this game to have an immence amout of fun with it. Youll win some and lose some, even with just the starter decks. All in all, I would really recommend this game. Its loads of fun, and the Async mode is really nice if you are someone who cant sit and play a full match.",

I was a long long time player of a similiar game called Poxnora back in the day but then taht game got bought out by Sony and collapsed before reviving once again with a new group... but I am totally burned out on Poxnora there are too many expansions with too many crazy abilities to make any kind of sense out of it anymore. THis game is a simplified version with chess like logic but a nice variety of abilities and spells that keeps you guessing on your toes all the time. I love the free card packs, I pulled a friggin something legendary that looks like the Eye of Sauron and it was so much fun to figure out how to play it. I highly recommend this game! ",

I wouldnt say this game is a P2W game as people who have spent money are quite beatable especially once you get yourself a few key rares/epics for your deck!",

Tournament now priced at 3K so if you want to get random good card, you just need win once before getting three losses 2. Just surrender when you dont have good cards (luck never always comes) 3. Grinding and keep collecting pts for either booster pack or special campaign (because after you win, you will receive booster pack + card) 4. Disenchant your unused cards wisely to craft some 'good' cards. 5. Spent ur $$$ if you like the game animation or better cards in advance (daily sale i mean) 6. Good enough to play when bored 7. Dont forget to play 'Async' mode, its good enough since has 1x24hr cd turn  Note; .... changed to 'RED', bug still in-game (playing twice with same person who used the bug, making other player dc'ed until next turn, and did same thing in the next turn).",

However, the game went through a drastic unannounced update which completely shattered balance. I would not recommend this game anymore. If anything, the devs don't really care that much about their playerbase. Just go to the forums and you can read for yourself how little they tend to care about player opinions :/ RIP what was a fun game.",

            "review_text": "*Editing Review after continued gameplay and reconsideration*  Initially, I gave this game a negative review, mainly due to a few bugs that only occurred once. That being said, after playing this game for a few hours more, those bugs have yet to occur again, and, since I realize now that the bugs aren't commonplace, I can give a better review.  First and foremost, being that this game is free to play, it is certainly worth a try, for those who enjoy turn-based strategy games. That being said, this game has a lot to offer for fans of this genre. This game offers ways for people with different play-styles to enjoy the game with others; there are different deck types that you can use. Do you enjoy utilizing a strategy involving keeping your cards healed, while also playing offensively? There is a deck for that. Do you enjoy having tank-type cards to rush the enemy castle in a blitzkrieg type fashion? There is also a deck for that.  All-in-all, if you play your cards right (pun intended), you can almost always come out on top, therefore making for an enjoyable, yet challenging, gaming session. That being said, I have read complaints about this game being 'Pay to Win,' and I must say, that's just not the case. Such an accusation likely comes from the fact that you can buy in-game currency to purchase booster packs, but, this game offers daily quests, worth plenty of currency and at no cost to the player, thus offering an equal chance to earn booster packs, just at a lesser pace. If you have the time, you can be on par with players who purchase a lot of booster packs, therefore creating a nice balance in gameplay.  So, if you are thinking about downloading this game, go ahead and do it, I'm sure you will be rewarded with an enjoyable experience.",

It is like Hearthstone or Magic the gathering plain and simple BUT what sets it apart from ALL oither card ganes i tried is that it changed the way the board itself is played on.  traditional card games stick with a front and center type of card placement. This game uses a chess board type.  Aside from Attack and Def card attributes there is also a movement speed. This works since you need to move your 'cards' near to attack the other player.  You know the hearthstone cards that give adjacent +1 s to your units. This card game uses that idea in a board type scenario.  I am still new to this but will continue to play for a while ",
