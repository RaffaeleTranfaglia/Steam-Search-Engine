    "description": "Deep underground lies a reminder of Boarkindâ€™s darkest hours. All it takes is one little boar to dig it back up. A block puzzler with an exploratory twist, Full Bore throws the player into an open world of crumbling mines, arcane ruins, and technological wonders with only curiosity to lead the way.",

            "review_text": "This gaming is AMAZING. It's like the honor-roll love child of Cave Story, Castlevania SOTN, and Adventures of Lolo, with maybe a streak of Portal. Simply fantastic.   I don't have enough good things to say about this game. If you are on the fence, just buy it. Even if you don't like it, the devs deserve your money. I feel like I need to spread the word about this game, so more people will buy it. This is a sleeper for sure, and it's a real tragedy it didn't sell like hotcakes.   I guess I'll write a short summary about why I liked it so much. The game is an open world block puzzler. That may not sound like the greatest thing ever, but the world the devs have created oozes mystery and begs you to explore every nook and cranny to find both it's arcane secrets, and to find more puzzles to solve simply for the sake of solving more. The exploration has the same sense of wonder that SOTN or Dark Souls has, but without any real enemies to speak of. And without the stress of Dark Souls constant deaths. And when you finally do find all the pieces, the story is quite compelling, well thought out, and plotted at a masterful pace (despite the occasional typo or misspelling). The pixel art is sometimes amazing, and sometimes just ok, but they do some kind of 2D normal mapping or something to have this neat dynamic lighting. It looks great sometimes, but sometimes it looks like prerendered graphics from late 16bit early 32bit era stuff. The music is also amazing. Good tunes that are appropriate to the scene when they need to be, and entertaining when you are working out puzzles.  Things I didn't like...Not much. The occasional puzzle stumped me, but that's cause I'm too dumb. I ended up having to look up 2 of the puzzles on Youtube, which I'm fine with. Most of the time when I got stuck I would put the game down and come back later and something would pop out at me. The time rewind mechanic was helpful, but it often didn't go where you wnated it to go, and that was annoying. The race can suck it, the control just isn't built for it, and I frankly didn't find it fun. But those are totally forgiveable complaints in the grand scheme of how amazing this is.   Probably in my top 20 gmes of all-time.  BUY IT!  Devs: I liked Full Bore on FB, but you guys don't have a developer page. I'd love to be able to follow you so at least I can keep abreast of any new projects.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty great. It's full of puzzles! Some of them are easy, some are very challenging. The control seemed weird to me but once I got used to it I couldn't stop playing. There's still a lot of the game left for me to complete but overall it's really good. I like the graphics, animation and MUSIC. It's very fitting! If you liked FEZ, you should like this game too.   The only thing I don't like are levels where you have to race someone or something - the character movement is tile based and it feels like the moving animation is slightly longer than the actual movement. I keep moving further than I want and it takes time to go back. I usually have to switch to keyboard for these parts for a more precise control.  However there is an amazing time warping system, very similar to the one in Braid. You can either stop time to think if you really need to save some of it, or reverse any action you've done back to the latest checkpoint or the beginning of current level.  8/10 so far, I can't think of anything that would not deserve such rating in this game. It's very well done!",

            "review_text": "Pros: +Open-World Exploration with many secrets to find +Perfect Difficulty +Great Music +Detailed story with multiple endings +Perfect difficulty on virtually all the puzzles  Cons: - I encountered one bug that would have prevented me from getting two achievements, but it randomly awarded credit for solving the puzzle (QR Code) after I reentered the room after beating the game. - In the beginning there's a character who tells you to go somewhere, and doesn't give directions how to get there. I don't want a highlighted minimap or something, but it makes sense for him to say go through the top corner, etc. - There is one puzzle that involves a QR code. It's a reference to Fez.   I had a great time with Full Bore. I bought it expecting just another puzzle platformer, but it's much more than that. It's a free-roaming open world exploration game, like Metroid without the enemies. This means it's probably closer to Fez than any other game, but I enjoyed it more because it generally avoids esoteric puzzles that require out of game knowledge. The main mechanic of the game is digging in unstable soil, which will be familiar to anyone who played Steamworld Dig. It works just as well here, but unlike Steamworld Dig you're expected to backtrack if you want to explore and the whole map isn't digging.   The music is great, the story is surprisingly complex, it has multiple endings but you can play after the two to three of them, and NPCs acknowledge your success. All in all, I highly recommend for fans of 2D puzzle games.",

Also, the difficulty is very-well balanced; while a handful of the puzzles are fiendishly difficult and a few (but only a few) will test your reflexes, most of them just require straightforward application of the gameplay rules you've learned up to that point. This is not to say they're easy... just that they're all solvable if you apply yourself.  Hard to recommend highly enough!",

The 'rewind' function present in the game is probably intended to be used when you make mistakes while you're trying to correctly dig your way round, but you'll find yourself using it just as often to take back unintended actions caused by the disconnect between your button presses and what your avatar actually does. Perhaps a more patient player can stick with it but I'd prefer to spend my time mastering systems, not wrestling with input.",
