            "review_text": "1954 Alcatraz just by it's name you can tell it's a prison break game. You play as husband Joe from inside of prison and Wife Christine from out side of prison.   The story is fairly short but decent. It's a basic find object use object to solve situation game. My first play though was around 5 hours and i missed 5 achievements. With a guide while reading a book at same time i was able to conplete my second play though to get 100% with only 132 minutes of game play.  The overall graphics is ok for indie but it is a still feels a bit outdated. Walking animation is choppy at times. There is one graphic bug that seen and took a screenshoot. There is also another bug that if you alt+tab out all you clue magnify glass and exit signs will show up on your screen forever without you ever need to press space for it.  The puzzle are really simple but it does take some time to find all the items needed.   Music is actually really engaging and is a big plus for this game.  All the conversation in this game is completely voiced and it's pretty well done.  Achievements are really easy to get but without a guide it's quite simple to miss a few.   6.5/10",

            "review_text": "1954: Alcatraz takes place in San Francisco during the 50's and tells the story of Joe who's serving a sentence of 40 years for armed assault and he's planning to escape the world's most notorious prison with the help of his wife, Christine. The plot is quite interesting, the atmosphere and soundtrack are great and the character switch feature works pretty well in this game. This game also allows the player to make a variety of choices with the power to change both main and secondary characters fate. 1954: Alcatraz is not the best point and click game ever but it's a pretty decent one that will keep the player engaged with the story and characters. That being said, I recommend it.",

Some possibilites of interaction are unexpected and make for a good laugh and the story development is not as predictable as in many other games. My main problem with this game is that its old and somewhat clunky/buggy controls somewhat ruin the atmosphere at a few points but other than that it is really worth playing if you like adventure games.",

Story and characters are interesting enough, but I wish it went more into the backgrounds of each character. The choices are fun to make and you can play through the game with having a different outcome. Choices you make affect the marriage of the characters you play as and effect the dialogue options  3d vision works well enough with the game, but can be a little weird in some scenes.",

            "review_text": "In a nutshell it's a very mediocre point and click adventure. It does have some good visuals and sound, but the story is rather uninspiring, slow and cumbersome. Trying to get some of the achievements will really do your head in as there will be many replays of the same thing over and over. The main story is that Christine has had her life threatened by the mob demanding to know where the hidden loot is from the recent bank heist which Joe had orchestrated and hid before being caught and sent to Alcatraz.  As a gamer you have to follow and help two different stories until they converge at the end. You have to help Joe escape and at the same time help Christine his wife follow the trail of bread crumbs and find the hidden stash of cash all the while being chased by horny police and germ o-phobic mafia.  Cant say it's suitable for children since it does reference blow jobs, drugs and homosexuality in several places, which doesn't really enhance the story or game-play in any way. At the same time adding these things and glamorizing them merely subtracts from it being any type of historic piece as these things were largely refrained from during that period and would have ended up with people being lynched.  The puzzles are merely grab objects and give them to the right people or set them down at the right place. So the game is hardly versatile or challenging, having said that you will still probably need a walk through as the game is rather pedantic when it comes to speaking to people first before you set down the object your 100 percent confident they need.  The big crescendo is child's play. Seriously a cat could work it out just walking up and down the keyboard. Which kind of robs you from experiencing that satisfying sensation you get when you hurdle a suitable challenge.  There's enough good points with the sound and visuals for it to get a thumbs up, but there is also enough bad points here with its lackluster, tedious game play and its groan out load cheap and cheesy Benny Hill rump a long humor. Unfortunately for me it was more thumbs down than thumbs up. Still for $2.00 when it is on sale at least it might be worth the look, but when it is at the normal price of $20. are you kidding me???",

            "review_text": "1954 Alcatraz is a point-and-click adventure with a setting quite well summarised in its title. It features atmospheric music supporting a well voice-acted, believable story. The game has a nice two-protagonist approach but some flaws in its situational progression and is missing some conveniences I expect in adventures.  + Nice and fitting music + Good voice-acting + (apart from continuity problems) Believable story + Addresses mature themes, sex and violence + Good scene art 0 Okay 3D character models 0 point-and-click progression better planned for the first half of the game - 'Cinematic' bars and useless blurring filter in cut-scenes - Janky animations - Loading times - No fast travel - Waiting for animations - Janky dialogue skipping - Some ways to dead-lock the game - Continuity problems - Funneling, useless waiting for activation of progression parts  I guess the game wants you to feel like you're watching a movie and an old movie at that. Otherwise the constant 'cinematic' bars and a blurry filter don't really make much sense. Anyway, I'd rather have a clear and big picture. The game addresses a few mature themes generally in connection with moral decisions which I appreciate.  I like the voice acting very much. All of the characters felt right to me that way.  I generally want to be able to fast-forward or skip parts of dialogue. Although available in principle it was a bit off here. At times skipping lines didn't work, sometimes you just skip the subtitles but the audio and video plays out, sometimes skipping resulted in unclickable dialogue choices or vanishing action points outside dialogue, effectively dead-locking the game.  For some reason the intro looks like its graphics were drawn with a sharpie which doesn't really fit the rest of the game and looks almost as if this part was skipped in design in favour of simply showing story board pieces. Well, might be the way the past is portrayed here. The character models are 3D and look okay but their animations looked odd at times. The background art is hand-drawn and pretty good, liked that.  Loading times, though still measured in seconds, are longer than I'd expect for an adventure game. This was most apparent when navigating Alcatraz which shows an overview of the island as sort of a hub to the sub-locations. The overview is a picture of the island in front of a picture moving up and a picture moving side-ways, plus a few animated birds - no reason for a longer wait. Does the game actually mandate waiting periods in loading times? Even though rooms are generally close together, I would like to see a fast-travel option on principle, i.e. quickly navigating to accessible rooms and leaving rooms with a double-click - respectively not and not generally possible here.  I think my main problem with the game was its incompletely planned progression, funneling and continuity errors. Besides dialogue going rogue you can also progress in the wrong location (   solving the second safe before getting the book to Joe   ) and dead-lock the game that way. I didn't like when a game unnecessarily waits for some event before allowing a specific action    couldn't 'pay the rent' before really wanting those passports   . And it feels, like some avenues were just left out of the game.    I couldn't find a way to use the pruno, and the girlie calendar seems to be designed to get the rope from Hank but the calendar cannot be taken.   Additionally the game fails some continuity checks (  e.g. we are still afraid to get iced by Mickey even after he is dead  ).  Despite the few problems I say 1954 Alcatraz is a good game and I recommend it for your adventure cravings.",

One of the key features is the ability to switch between the two main characters with each having to solve their own puzzles or tasks, which was well done and a nice change of pace.  The puzzles are good, some are harder than others but I still wished that they had scaled up the difficulty slightly more. This game is a bit older, but nevertheless it has good visual arts, in my opinion.   But overall 1954 Alcatraz is a good game and should be on everybody's radar, who enjoy point and click adventure games.",
