            "review_text": "I don't know what compelled me to even buy this since I can't stand RTS games generally, but it didn't take long before Darwinia became one of my all-time favorites. Something in the way it's presented just made sense to me, and I found the context to be especially endearing.  Part of what really appealed to me was how simple and straightforward everything was: soldiers shoot stuff, engineers build stuff, etc. Even the upgrade options, in the context of file updates (v2.0), made everything feel more accessible. The game code is mercifully stable for an 'indie' game and I found myself wasting hours defeating every last enemy and making sure that every uninhabited piece of land was repopulated. I frequently found myself rooting for individual scouts and soldiers that bravely out-maneuvered their enemies. It really says something about a game that can make you feel so attached to its literal pixels.  The excellent score and sound effects coupled with the game's relaxingly retro aesthetic have proven great for replayability, making Darwinia a world I'm happy to revisit often. 9/10.",

Otherwise you probably won't.  The game definitely pays tribute to Tron and other such digital-grid visual experiences. Regarding Tron, anybody else notice the bombers for airstrikes in this game are called 'Invaders'? Heh.",

            "review_text": "In most RTS games, resource-gathering and military power are two mostly separate things. In Darwinia, your resources are actually the souls of dead units and you need to harvest them soon after you kill them.   This choice between harvesting and military is very dynamic. You can and have to change your tactics fast to deal with the situation. You have a low maximum number of units but there is no build time. However, you can only build at certain locations, so waiting time depends on where the battle is taking place.  Third, micro-management is quite different from what you're used to: You don't just click to attack, you decide exactly where your soldiers shoot. Macro-management is really narrative-driven. Levels have very different goals with each other and winning feels more like solving a puzzle than managing and allocating resources.   Darwinia is a weird little game, it's one of those things that broaden your horizons. That's why it shouldn't be missed.",

Darwinia focuses on a virtual world on the server of Dr. Sepulveda, with little green people figures called Darwinians. As you find out, they're under a viral attack and desperately need your help to survive. Dr. Sepulveda's life work is on the line, and it's up to you to use the programs he gives you, or can find, to destroy the virus and save a breakthrough in AI programming. The gameplay is simple, easy to understand, and while the visuals aren't 'photorealistic' they are perfectly fitted for the theme of the game, and very Tron like, lending it a perfect visual capacity. You can upgrade your various programs to greater effectiveness, and guide the little Darwinians to help them get their world back. It's incredibly fun, and the story is quite compelling.",

The setting and atmosphere are perfect, the difficulty is perfect, and the story manages to be interesting and compelling despite being given almost no time for exposition of any kind.   I have played through this game many times now - even more than my playtime suggests since it can run on a toaster and so is perfect for old laptops with no internet connection - and every time I find it entertaining and challenging. For the price, this is an amazing purchase, and I wish Introversion would give it the sequel it sorely deserves. No, Multiwinia does not count.  One protip if you play this though: Don't use the GUI. Hotkeys are significantly better.",

            "review_text": "I personally liked the game.I beat the whole story in 13 hours (that is killing every enemy on the map not just completeing each objective) and enjoyed every bit of it! Frist i'll tell you what i liked about the game: The story, the art style, and gameplay! I haven't read much about the story in other reviews but i like it and thats all ill say. The art style is supposed to look like you are in a computer world(kinda like tron) so it is really simple but kinda 'cute' or cartoony. The game play is what everyone is talking about so first the problems. I couldn't unplug my headset while playing the game or else an error would appear and it would crash. The Darwinians are like cattle where they move in straight lines but if you use officers correctly then you're fine. a bug happened where i couldn't build anything but restarting the game fixed that. The first mission (not prolouge) is really boring and that deterrs many people. Positive: Alot of game time for 1$ (currently 13hrs) I thought the sound effects were funny. Some stratiegic thought and tactics do go into this game. (its not just run at each other, get more units and repeat) You unlock something at the end that increases the amount of time you could play it! ;) Nice soundtrack There is alot more that i like but i must go to the counter arguments or problems. Dubhe said '- Units with bizarre controls, like: --- Left click to select --- Left click to move --- Left click and hold to to special action 1 --- Left click and hold near the unit to do special action 2' I don't know what game he was playing but you do use left click to select and move but you hold right click to shoot and while holding right click if you left click they do their special. Dubhe also said '--- Don't worry, though, because your units will randomly exit and reenter the turret every couple of seconds! Even during battle! --- Also, you can't control where the turret fires! And it does damage to friendly units! --- And, it's inexplicably easy for enemy units to kick your guys out and take control of the turret!' My units never reentered and exited turrets unless the units inside the turret were killed. You can control where the turret fires but darwinians have to be inside and your units can also kick enemy out of turrets too. (kinda funny when they just keep kicking each other.) XD Lidion45 said 'Unable to select more than one unit at once?!?! Clunky controls for moving units Units don't fire by themselves, yet randomly play the shooting sound when you're not looking? Bullets bouncing on uneven terrain makes shooting very awkward given most of the map is mountainous' Yes the first is true but i didn't have a problem with it. My units did fire by themselves (maybe he/she didn't have darwinian reasearched to level 2?) Bullets do bounce on terrain and sometimes that got annoying so i avoided terrain like that.  Overall i loved the game even though it does have its little bugs and problems but wouldn't buy it for the 10$ (or 20$ for both) I would get them on sale so you get both games for 1.30$.  (No offence to the other reviews I just used yours as counter arguments.)",

Once you complete the game (which does take a decent amount of time), you are able to create your own worlds and share them with others to complete.

This game takes the best of arcade-fashion gameplay and adds the 3rd dimension. The first time I saw this game I was fascinated by how simultaneously old and new it looked.  On top of that, this game is fun as hell to play. I care about these freaking computer shapes. I feel sad when they die. I feel happy when they win. The battles in this game can become massive and the death toll can become unconscionable. This is thanks to the story, which beautifully gives life to simple pixellated shapes in such an incredible manner, it makes the whole thing almost believable.  Oh, also.
