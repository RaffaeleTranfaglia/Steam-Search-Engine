            "review_text": "I first got my hands on this game via a demo disc from McDonald's back when it was first released. The disc came with a trailer for Kingdom Hearts, a music video for I'm Still Here from the Treasure Planet movie, and some images/desktop backgrounds. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much from an incomplete, licensed game demo bundled with a Happy Meal.  Boy, was I wrong.  I played the demo for many, many hours. It defied my expectations with thrilling action, simplified but tight strategy mechanics, and an above-average soundtrack that really puts you in the mood for, well, being in a ship out in space. I remember being astounded the first time I sailed through a nebula, eager to find whatever mysteries lay behind the pink clouds. I remember watching in fear as a black hole swallowed ships, tearing them asunder. All this in just a demo!  Jumping back into the full release, I thought that nostalgia would have dulled my senses, or maybe I wouldn't remember how to play, or maybe I would be biased. Again, I was wrong. I jumped right back in (speaking to the ease of the gameplay) and was immediately surprised to find that it was just as fun as I remembered! That's something that can't be said for many games.  To sum up, I really enjoy Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon. It enhances the story of the original film and raises the bar for licensed games everywhere with stunning space combat done correctly, solid voice acting, graphics and sound that really put you in the world (or in space, if you prefer), and just being plain fun to learn and play. I wholeheartedly recommend it for fans of action-strategy games, space combat, or video games in general.  TORPEDOES AWAY!",

I love the immersion you get in this game, and also despite its age this game has great graphics.   Never got the chance to play true multiplayer, but seing this release on Steam made me instantly buy this and I can't wait to try online play!  MUST BUY THIS GAME!!!",

            "review_text": "This game is nostalgic for me, it was one of the first strategy video games I had ever played. The mechanics are simple but effective, giving you just enough control over your ships to make the game fun, without the unneeded complexity other strategy games have. Don't get me wrong, complex strategy games can be fun as well. I am a huge fan of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but sometimes it's fun to just sit back, relax, and play a simple fun game. I definitely recommend this game.",
