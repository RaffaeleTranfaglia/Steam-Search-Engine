            "review_text": "updated DEC 2016 waaaaaaaay over priced for extra songs ;-(  Its fun but I am not a beginner.  Runs great and stays in time :thumsup: Its not bad but not really a learning thing its just what it says it is karaoke. The stumming thing takes you to Justinguitar for his lessons on strumming in the APP but goes nowhere here right now. Yea. Justin Would be worth the price if you got to pick the the 100 songs from their 1500 +song bank in the app. I could not find how much or where to get additional songs from.  If I could pick my own 100 starting song book I would pay 20$ for this. They do a good job explaining the APP in their'About this game'  But its Just an app despite being able to use it on you PC  But hey Justin Recomends it so who am I ;-)   Till the Pricing thing is sorted out.and made available. I really cant recommend it right now. Was gonna refund But ill keep it and see where it go's Just because Justin has gave a lot to the guitar and music community   I got no answer from the DEV on pricing. I played the android free version it is the same but you get no free songs and is 35.00 a year at 40% off right now or 4.99 a mo. kinda steep IMO. So lets hope they dont go that way There is no real instraments or sounds all electronically generated.&lt;Not a",

            "review_text": "So happy I stumbled on to this great app! Playing in a band I normally write and play my own songs but sometimes if's fun to play cover songs as well. FourChords is perfect for playing popular songs with my acoustic guitar. The songs included with the price provide a nice variety of pop and rock songs from different times. I even learned a new chord today by using the Pro Chords option. Highly recommended if your goal is to have fun playing songs with your guitar. If you are looking to learn detailed techniques for riffs and solos then there are better other options out there for that.",
