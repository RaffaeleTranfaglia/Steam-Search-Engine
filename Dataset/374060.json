            "review_text": "A good psychological horror with a few scattered moments of survival horror, but:  This game has had a few lingering issues for some time now and there has been no response on the forum from the dev team for quite some time so it's safe to assume this game has been abandoned in its current state.  There have been multiple issues with in-game progress not being saved correctly making the game impossible to complete to 100% without playing in one sitting. Given some of the issues I've seen in the forums I would not bank on that working either. The game can still be played through if that is all you are looking for but I recommend a visit the forums beforehand to gander at some of the ongoing problems people are having with this game. If you decide to go ahead remember to use the 3 save slots.  No in-game sensitivity adjustment.",

            "review_text": "Stairs is a really nice psychological horror game, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how great the game was.  You're a freelance journalist, trying to investigate the murder of a girl in an abandoned factory. You will find creepy things, hear voices, see things that are not supposed to exist. During the whole game, you will go deeper, and deeper, hence the name Stairs. You don't spend the whole game in a stairwell, the stairs are just a mean to go deeper, and the deeper you get, the more f*cked up things will be. You are supplied with a flashlight and a camera, which will turn out the be extremely important. (Also, at first glance, the game is a freaking maze, but don't let that impress you, everything is pretty intuitive, you'll know where to go.)  About the negative things: Nothing made sense at the end of the game, and the end itself seems pretty botched. It's like the devs didn't know how to end the game and they decided to end it abruplty without enough explanation. Either it's a really sh*tty ending, or maybe I didn't understand the subtlety of it. After all, I didn't get the achievement called 'The Truth Behind the Lies', so I probably missed things!  I totally recommend the game nonetheless.",

            "review_text": "I so hate to give this game a negative review.  It's beautifully made, it has a great atmosphere... and it dies on me at the same spot each and every time.  I saw Let's Plays of it and I know something's terribly wrong concerning my game. I either die at a part where there shouldn't be enemies or - at the same part - the game just tells me it found an error and shuts down on me. This is very frustrating, especially as I ACTUALLY LIKE THE GAME.  Dear makers, please give us a patch that makes the game work. I have only seen half of it and although I bought it in the recent sale for 3 bucks, that is not how it's supposed to be. Is it? If you need further infos about my particular broken game, just contact me here. I'd be happy to 'help'.  UPDATE: I managed to get around the aforementioned bug. Don't ask me how. I am almost done with the game now, I guess, and it didn't bug anymore. I am now giving a positive review but please still consider debugging as much as you can.",

Very sloppy.",

I was wondering about it all the time playing it and even after the end it wasn´t clear at all. Then i found out that other people didn´t catch more info either. On steam hub you can find explained story from devs and its rly great, just you have to search for getting to know.. There are also some few other things as small bugs or broken achievements ...  It´s not the top horror game ever, but anyway i enjoyed it and i would recommend it to people who are used to these indie horror games and enjoying them same as me :)",
