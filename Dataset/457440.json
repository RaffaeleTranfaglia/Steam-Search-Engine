Features:  - Graphics look modern, although absolutely caked in chromatic aberration... - Totally random set of conflicting ideas with no real gameplay besides walking and jumping. - Annoying and sterotyped racist 'announcer', stupid 'monsters' (men in pants) with racist asian one liners...  - Totally random for seemingly for no reason, some gameplay elements make no sense like being able to throw burgers for no purpose... And most power ups you can get don't seem to do anything. - Game isn't remotely scary because it's too dumb and most of the 'monsters' are men in pants...  - Totally silly and jokey nothing about it is near funny.  I know it's like 2 quid... But spend it on the community market or something and you'd have a better time.  It's almost like it's deliberately taking the p*ss out of you for buying it...",
