My arm hurts from clicking, there's a feral creature shrieking persistently in my skull, and my mouse seems to have taken to sobbing silently when I get to a boss level. I'm only writing this to give myself a brief reprieve from the game. Even now it's still open, whispering softly and seductively to me, bending me slowly backwards with its long, icy fingers. This game is my drug, and I can't ♥♥♥♥ing stop clicking. It has me trapped, helpless, teaching me hundreds of new ways to be addicted to something. Clicker Heroes is the dark, divine deity to which cocaine and heroin pray. If you find this, contact los federales, or mi madre, I'm frightened and afraid of what Clicker Heroes might do to me.  8/8",

            "review_text": "Clicker Heroes   Another game people will either love (for unknown reasons) or simply disregard due to its nature.     The game in a nutshell    You click on static monsters and each click will deal damage. When the monster dies it drops gold. You accumulate gold and purchase upgrades which makes your clicking stronger. Monsters only vary in visual display and have no abilities or resists. Only an ever increasing pool of health which is depenant on the zone level. Killing 10 monsters in a zone level will open up the next zone level. Every 10 zone levels there are Bosses. Special monsters with much more health which only give you a timewindow of 30 seconds to beat before they restet to full health and the time window starts anew. You must kill these in order to progress and can see them as 'benchmarks' to check if you are ready or not.  Apart from active play the game will simulate your progress (measured by your DPS, not clicking damage) even if you are offline tho you cannot progress passively (yet). Entering the next zone is an active thing but if you are missing out on gold to purchase that next upgrade you can let it run in offline mode for an hour or two and continue from there.     going deeper    Clicking is only your first layer tho. You quickly open up new heroes which provide you with your second layer of gameplay. DPS aka Damage Per Second. These heroes deal damage over time on their own. Even if you stop clicking damage will continue to pour in. So DPS is kind of like a passive buff for your game. Apart from buying heroes to become active (first purchase to level 1) you can continue leveling them up to make their DPS stronger in turn enhancing your killing power of the monsters on the screen.   In addition each hero has a set of abilities which unlock at certain levels (10, 25, 50, 75 and 100) providing better capabilities or ACTIVE ABILITIES     it becomes more then mindless clicking    There are 9 active abilities you can trigger at any point. Each one has an effect duration (usually 30 seconds) and a cool-down preventing you from spamming them. Effects range from more click damage to more gold per kill to support buffs and even a permanent damage buff. Unlocking these abilities and timing their use will become a key part of defeating higher level Bosses     it just doesnt stop    There will be a point where you ll run into a 'wall'. Monsters will become so powerfull that it takes a long time to kill them and bosses will eventually become so mighty that you will be unable to beat them even if you use all your active abilities. This is the point where you use the 'Ascension' feature for the first time.  At first it doesnt sound like anything anybody in his right mind would do. 'Creates a new universe, much like the current one. This will restart your game and you will receive XXX Hero Souls'.  Wait.....It just resets my game to level one....all gold and hero levels are gone and I simply start over? LAME!!!!!!  But wait....whats these hero souls then?     Hero Souls....the meta game    Hero Souls are kind of a permanent currency coming through an ascension. Each one you have banked (read....showing in your display) will increase your damage by 10%. Its accumulative so if you have 5 your whole damage will increase by 50%. With 10 of these babies you ll DOUBLE your damage. So even tho you have to go through all the levels you beat beforehand a second time.....THIS time will be far easier and much quicker to get to the point where you grinded to a stop before and continue past that point.  And thats not all. As a permanent currency they open up the market for a special sort of heroes. The Ancients.     Ancient Heroes....the game turns tactical    What makes these heroes special is that they also....just like Hero Souls transfer through an ascension and you gonna keep them. There is a whole list of them and each one buffs your game in a special way. Purchasing them costs hero souls. Leveling them up costs hero souls and you ll need to start thinking about what will give you the most bang for your buck (read....do you keep the HS banked or do you invest them?)  You ll soon realize that many ancients support each other so getting the 'right mix' of ancients can massively increase your efficiency at going through the treadmill (ascend and go through all those levels again).     The truth comes out...whats it all about    Now the game shows its true color. With all these features unlocked you are ready for the neverending(!) 'management and improvement of resources' to push further on a new try which makes so many other genres successfull.  4x RTS RPGs ARPGs Economy Simulations  If you enjoy any of these genres chances are you ll LOVE clicker heroes. Its free to play so what do you have to lose?    Me...I find myself booting it up almost every day and even tho I ascended more then a hundred times already it doesnt really get old. The asciension is more like a 'test run' by now to see if you made the correct choices on spending your hero souls and which ancients to get and level. Its this 'game within game' which makes me come back....certainly not the clicking. Theres some form of 'grinding' to get enough HS but many games have this so not really a problem.  Its a most simple game and the fact that its so addictive is baffling in itself.  For myself I can say that its been a great way to 'waste' my freetime so far. I dont regret picking it up :)",

There's no real strategy, no real purpose, it's just clicking mindlessly and spending 'rewards' to get things to click for you faster. I put probably 100+ hours into this (most of the time in the background), restarted it four times, was doing 22 Decillion damage per second, and was still spending minutes as it beat each monster. There is seriously no redeeming value in this game, and it is insidiously addictive. Stay far away. You've been warned.",

There are way better things to waste time on.

But that all changed when Clicker Heros came onto steam. Only the Gaben mastered all four communities. Only he could stop the ruthless Devs at Playsaurus. But when the world needed him most, he retired. Two hundred hours have passed and Clicker Heros is nearing victory in the War of games played in my friendslist. Two days ago, my clan leader and the men of my server journeyed to the empty servers of DayZ to help fight against the Cilcker Heros, leaving me and my brother to look after our server. Some people believe that the Gaben was never reborn into the issac speed runners, and that the cycle is broken. But I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow, the Gaben will return to save the world.  Jk its a good game :)",

Then after you become a little more powerful you get stuck at doing only up to level 160-170 for about 1 month. Before this game came to Steam and was only a flash game on the internet, with 100-150 souls you could reach level 180 with no problem and with 150+ souls you can do up to level 200+. Now, you play for a week or two, get to 100/200 souls and you can reach level 130-160 with no problem. BUT after that comes the mega-uber-never-seen-before farming. I had 300 souls and I can barely reach level 170-180 level. Unless you give a lot of real money for this crappy game, then you will have to farm for the rest of your life. Oh... and at some point you will see that this game won't be so casual, you will sit for 10 minutes, but you will see that, that won't be enough at some point, the game forces you to waste up to 40-45 minutes of your time and probably even more as you progress. I do NOT think this game even deserves to be on Steam, but that's my opinion. In any case I do NOT recommend this game. It's a HUGE waste of your lifespan, believe me I lost somewhere around 30 hours(the 70 hours you see are because I've been AFK for over 30 hours) in this game. Believe me it isn't worth your time!

Keep in mind that I've played countless hours of this game soley on the browser version and so my current number of hours does not represent my knowledge on the game. However, I admittedly haven't played in a while. I did a quick recap of this game on steam and it hasn't changed much.   Let me start out with stating the fact that there is a bizarely shocking number of people who dislike this game for various reasons. Let me list some common reasons I've seen in the reviews on the Steam version of the game and a short response to each one.  1) The game is basically cookie clicker with microtransactions.   Response: So what? First off - it's completely free to play. If you knew what cookie clicker is and how it did things you know this game is all about grinding gold and such to get upgrades to your clicks. Furthermore, you don't even have to do anything to rack up gold in this game after a certain point. You literally don't need to 'play' it. This is achievement grinder 2015.  2) The game has no 'skill' or anything involved. 'It's just clicking!'   Response: Pull your head out of your ♥♥♥ promptly. Please locate the part in the description of this game where it says this is a 'Highly skill based game!' and then I'll get back to you. It's as casual as it gets, truly.   3) Pay to Win.   Response: AHAHAHAHAHA oh god. Please! Please!  4) It's easy to just cheat so what's the point?  Response: I don't know. If you feel like breaking a game and finding ways to cheat in it (IE: getting an auto clicker of sorts) that's your own thing. Truly, who gives a damn? This isn't an MMO, this isn't Call of Duty. You're only cheating yourself out of hours upon hours of 'riveting' gameplay. This game is meant to be casual in the first place, so do us all a favor and stop your ♥♥♥♥♥ing please and thank you.  --------------------------------------------------------  Now that that's out of the way let me touch on what this game advertizes and offers up front to you, the consumer.  -Ascend to be able to have DPS's of up to ' one quadrillion damage per second '.  -Know how ' one quadrillion damage per second' feels. -Click on monsters to kill them and get gold (virtual) for it. -Hire heroes to deal more damage which in turn will up your kills per minute, which ups your gold per minute in general. -'Meet' legendary figures such as Athena. 35 unique heroes to hire. -Make your MMO character's feel like kindergarteners because of their damage per second's.  -Spend your 'hard earned loot' to upgrade your heroes and gain special abilities from them. -Over 100 different monsters, all beautifully drawn and animated, including boss creatures. -Earn gold while you're idle. No clicking required if you have heroes! Earn while you do the laundrey, etc.  -----------------------------------------------  Now, looking at these features the game seems to offer most of them. To be honest, I haven't put in the play time to verify some of these features but at this point and time I trust the developers on their numbers. I don't think they'd lie to me about what they advertised in their game. 35 unique heroes, I'm sure there are. Over 100 monsters? Great! I'll be counting and I'll compile a list and update this at a later date. I haven't gotten to nearly anywhere near one quadrillion dps but I'm sure it's possible given one of the acheivements for this game is to reach zone 2400 (or something), which would - given my experience - require a 'metric f*ck ton' of damage per second to beat anything there.  So far I recommend this game. That may change if I find the features to be lacking compared to what was advertised. Far too often people expect far too much from a game when the developers didn't even advertise it. A game shouldn't be based on anything other than what the developers advertise regarding a rating. That being said, a game can be flat out crap and even broken. However, this game is none of that.   Clicker heroes is a very well done super casual game with all the tools a casual gamer could ever want to use as well as plenty of acheivements to complete and many other things to aquire in game for you collectionists and completionists out there. Even if your interaction with the game is minimal you can still enjoy getting achievements.   Clicker heroes will receive a high rating from me for a few reasons. First off, I genuinely enjoyed it. It's cute, it's a light bit of fun and can be worth the expresso shots to wake you up in the morning after a hard, long night of advancing your quest to get carpel tunnel syndrome from clicking like a mad man with multiple fingers on multiple hands and feet. No one is there to call you a noob, tell you to uninstall or learn to play, because it's not targetted at an audience such as that. So, secondly, it knows who it's marketing to. It doesn't claim to be a 'skill based game' or any nonsense like that. It doesn't claim to have great graphics (though it does deliver on it's lovely art style), or have fantastically new and intriguing features or have a world that has you immersed  BallsDeep  in it's riveting and in depth storyline and world.  It's just a fun, casual time waster based on clicking the same spot hundreds upon thousands of times, or farming gold from your heroes and making the odd update here and there.   For these reasons I give this game a TEHN AOUTTA TEHN!   Now, for my current list of achievements and other information I've gotten from playing the game.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Acheivements Completed   Zone Explorer - Beat Zone 10 Frantic - Click 12 times in 1 second Frenetic - Click 14 times in one second Boss Slaughter - Kill 10 bosses Boss Massacre - Kill 100 bosses Boss Exterminater - Kill 1000 bosses Proficient Clicking - Click 1000 times Killer - Kill 100 monsters Butcher - Kill 1000 monsters Guide - Level up heroes 100 times  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Unique Monster's Slain Total: 22    Zone 1  Gloop Catra Finky Sasquish Gerbeel Spit Flower Flower Bloop Loggernaut Mushroom Bloop Angry Potato Tyrantula Gerbeelpillar Impossumble Grablin Flowering Caperticus Caperticus Sand Ball - lol wtf Dirge Beetle  Goboolin Treasure Chest Scorpinch Sand Bloop - Upgraded from Sand Ball? xD   ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Bosses Slain Total: 3   Mamma Ferny Fat Bat - LV5 - Zone 5 Emperor Skorpinch - LV10 - Zone 10 King Caperticus - LV15 - Zone 15   ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Heroes Aquired   Cid, The Helpful Adventurer - Level 82 Treebeast - Level 81 Ivan, The Drunken Brawler - Level 26 Brittany, Beach Princess - Level 3 The Wandering Fisherman - Level 1 Betty Clicker - Level 1 The Masked Samurai - Level 1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Skills Aquired   Clickstorm - From Cid, The Helpful Adventurer",

            "review_text": "In the beginning, you click. A lot. You click so much that you can't even believe it. And when you think you can't click anymore, the game says 'Ascend...' So you do. Which just puts you back at the beginning, but with the souls of fallen heroes powering your click engine even further. So you click even more. And ascend again, even more powerful.   But the souls are just a new form of currency, allowing you to summon ancient forces to do your bidding. Making your spells stronger, your gold piles larger. Turning each click into nuclear hellfire that pushes you further. But no matter how far you push, the monsters always overpower you, drawing you into a stalemate that you must escape. Only to repeat your mistakes.  Then you meet Siyalitas. He shows you another way. 'Click not, and I shall unleash my power' Then the idle times begin, allowing you to gather hundreds, then thousands of souls to feed the ancient's hunger. You learn that your weakest heroes will become the strongest. Clicking becomes only a last resort against an unstoppable foe. You pass hundreds of levels, knowing there are thousands more to conquer. This is where I find myself. Is this my new life now?  I basically haven't stop playing for a month and I've barely scratched the surface. But everything now is just math. Which hero will help me the most? Is my DPS higher with souls or a fed ancient? How high can the numbers get? It feels like exporation, but is it?   Am I still having fun? I'm not sure. I know that I did for a long while. That's more than I can ask from a free game.",

The hook that gets you into the game is the satisfaction of mindlessly spamming a button so you can save up for upgrades and do more and more DPS to kill tougher and tougher creatures. In actual fact, the fun in the game for me (as a fan of the genre) is in optimising the build order to reach the end game faster.  Looking at the maths involved to help decide what is the best thing to buy or save for at any given time from an efficiency perspective and whether or not you are wanting a build designed for pure idling or for more active clicking is where a lot of the fun comes for me. Watching the deepz grow is just a nice side effect of that!  It's a fundamentally pointless game, and I certainly won't be taking part in the micro transactions (I'd rather just pay a fiver for the game instead, to help the devs!), but for a few hours of clicking it's certainly fun and if you get into the end game mechanics of it all and the soft reset function that is seen in many of the more developed idling games, then it has a lot more depth than you'd initially think.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr version: game ends unexpectedly, you will literally have to grind for years to get it to 'end' with a monster that has infinite HP, aka unbeatable.   -Full Review I don't recommend it at all... after tinkering around with the game, and serious calculations that led me to go further in, so in I decided to check if it was viable to an end and... the game 'ends' the following way:  -Level 4725 is unbeatable because the exponential number is so damn high on that boss that it reads 'InfiniK', so no more progression. Monsters have HP greater than 5.9999e256, that is an extremely high number, like... so high it would take many paragraphs of numbers just to write it down.  -When you go looking around for 'saves', you can actually edit your save via a save decoder and import it directly to the game, meaning that 99.99 sack of rubies is a total bs price for a total bs numbered game.  -I had 1,000S hero souls active, that is without considering the couple millions of souls inverted in upgrading ancients to ridiculous high levels, and that wasn´t enough added DPS PER HERO... you read it right, I had one OCTILLION hero souls (one octillion is is 10^27, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 multiplied by +10% each, it's +10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000% DPS) after I modified the save and the DPS still wasn't enough beyond lvls 2000+, I can't believe it... I literally inverted over one million dollars worth of hero souls into ancients to get passive boosts...   I had the following:   · +10,000% per gild damage bonus (feels like nothing lvls 1,500+) · +3,000% critical damage bonus (when you get a critical it does significant damage, significant enough to deal 1/3 of a monsters HP when you have around 7,500! DPS... one third?) · +2,000% click damage · +100% DPS per click combo · +13,000% idle gold bonus (still had to grind hours for last 5 characters... to get 13,000% bonus idle gold you must spend an insatiable amount of hero souls IN THAT ANCIENT ALONE...) · +10,000% gold dropped (still had to grind hours for last 5 characters...) · +5,000% gold from chests (should I say I had to grind again?) · +10,373% Hero soul DPS which felt it did nothing at all. · +11,400% gold from golden clicks. (combined with all the extra gold things, I still had to grind...) · +225,000% idle DPS bonus (it was 22,500% idle DPS bonus and it barely scratched monsters on lvl 2,000, +225,000% worked until lvl 2,500 where I had to take Astraea to lvls over 2000 to make DPS high to quickly advance). · Max level in all ancients with level cap  Summary, this games exponential calculations are so damn high that it would take years, many years... to get to a point where you just get stuck and never advance or feel you got a real ending or closure. It was fun the first 5 hours, the rest was a tedious waiting and grind. The hours spent were mostly tinkering with calculations, which are too high to make it worth. And the funny thing it starts so small...  I have to mention I had Astraea with 351 gilds, each having a bonus of 10,000% and I had to increase her up to level 3800 to make it to lvl 4,275 without a problem (monster dying almost instantly each time).  It is not worth the trouble to get in too deep with this game... and the funny thing is Playsaurus saying 'please buy rubies to support the development of the game'... it's a piece of trash and an excuse for a quick buck to make some other pay to play game... like Candy Crush, FarmVille and all other excuses for 'games' out there... I fkn hate this model that forces users to spend money to get some fun out of it. It's surprisingly easy to cheat on this game however.",

            "review_text": "Yet another idle game approaches steam, and many ask one simple question- Why? Aren't these games that you just open in a browser window and play a more fun game overtop? Aren't these games that you shouldn't have to open in a big window and let all your friends see that you're basically playing the equivalent of willingly getting carpal tunnel?  All that debate about that aside, this is a fairly good idle game. I'm a fan of idle games as long as they do something different, and this one is a bit generic, but also does a few new things to spice the 'genre' up. The game still has the overall mushy formula of all idle games (click, add a few more 0's to your number, wait more, switch out your 0's for a 'K' or an 'M') but it adds 'dungeons' and 'skills' and what would normally be buildings in other idle games are instead adventurers that you level up and unlock special passives for each one. These passives are usually the generic '100% bonus damage' upgrades, but some add critical hits to your mouse, special skills you can use, and probably more as I haven't gotten too far in this game yet.   There's also a cash shop, but it's ridiculously tacked on and you can just ignore it completely and pretend it doesn't exist. It's more of a 'donation' button than anything, the bonuses it provides are basically just equivalent of foil trading cards that deal a tiny bit more damage so don't really bother or worry about it  So would I recommend this game? Well, it's the second best 'idle' game i've ever played, leagues better than cookie clicker (but less memetic) so if you're into these kinds of things then go ahead and check it out.",

It's something to do while you're waiting for what you really want to play to finish downloading or updating, or you just don't have enough time to put into actually playing anything.   Of the various clicking games I've come across (Cookie Clicker, et al), this is one of the better ones. It starts off painfully slow, but if you stick with it, it eventually ramps up. And thankfully, it doesn't require constant clicking to advance. There are skills and power ups, and leveling, and there's some RMT stuff in there so that you can spend money on it and get the trading cards if that's your thing.  There's no skill required to advance, just time. And to get all of the achievements will take months. However, it's not a power hungry game, and your heroes are earning gold while you're not actively playing.   Pros: Will work on any system that can run Steam. There are achievements. Good for when you don't have a lot of time, or you're waiting for something else. Something to do while watching TV. It's free.  Cons: This isn't a game. Clicking gets old fast. It'll probably take more than a year to get all the achievements. It's the exact same thing you can play on the website.  Verdict: If you've got a lot of time to kill and can spare the pittance of space it takes on your hard drive, why not?",

There are a lot of ancients to use(skill-based, idle-boost, click-boost, treasure-boost, quick-ascension-boost, primal-HS-boost) that augment or disable different strategies Sometimes its not fun, even though you will continue to play it. However, if you dont feel like playing, stop. Two weeks later, when you want to play it, your heroes will have been grinding for two weeks, and you'll get a slight high, 'Look at all of this money! = look how much farther I got!'  Cons: Time, you will not stop playing this if you make it past lvl 200...ever!  All in all: One of my favorite games, mainly because this is one of the most fun, balanced, and repeatable idle games ever made, and if I do not feel like playing, I will be better off when I come back to play.",

The game was kind of fun the first minutes but after that, you'll just go afk and let your heroes does the rest for you (once they're high level enough to kill monsters).  It's not a bad game but It's not a game you would be playing without doing something else like watching the TV, playing another game, kissing your wife or husband.

I've seen a lot on the forums about an app called autoclicker, If you're just to use an app to finish the game, why even bother playing it at the first place? That doesn't makes sense.  It can be fun while having something else to do at the same time but other than that, It's more of a waste of time that will destroy your life if you always play it because it can get very long.  Also, It's almost like Call of Duty but even better, all you have to do is 'click' 'click' 'click' 'click' 'dead' 'click' 'click' 'click' 'dead' but the thing is that you do not die! Awesome, no?

That gold is used to level up heroes, unlock hero skills and player skills. The game is actually quite complex so I won't get into it here, but you can check out the Clicker Heroes subreddit for more info.  The monetization strategy revolves around using actual money to circumvent the time required to grind certain resources to unlock things. Those resources can be gained without paying but can take a long time, so it's not mandatory.  In short - click or don't. Get money and level up heroes to do stupid damage.   There aren't many cons to this game seeing as it's free, but one thing that annoyed me was how the new 'auto clicker' is described in-game. I'll copy it verbatim - 'Auto clickers can be used to automatically level  heroes , activate skills and click monsters for you.'  The above emphasis is mine since that's the reason why I spent $9.99 on the rubies required to unlock it. I don't use the skills much or click since I've opted for a maximum idle-damage build. What I was really interested in was the fact that it said heroes. Plural. I figured an autoclicker will automatically apply levels to EVERY hero whenever it can, but that is not the case. Instead, for $9.99 I got something that clicked one single hero level up button 10 times a second.  There are 44 heroes. I'd need to purchase 44 auto clickers in order to get the functionality I believed I was getting. Also, the autoclickers get more expensive after each purchase. The first was 100 rubies. Now it's 150. That will probably keep going up.   I don't believe that the description is intentionally misleading but I think it is vague enough to warrant a change. Instead it should say that the autoclicker only levels ONE hero at a time instead of saying heroes plural.  Conclusion - I know I just wrote twice as much complaining about the one and only time I spent real money on this game, but I will give it a pass for now since $9.99 is still a steal for 100 hours of gameplay. Just be warned that the autoclicker doesn't do what it says on the tin.",

            "review_text": "Addictive, but casual medium-fun game.  Recommended to read guidelines and strategy's. Otherwise you run into walls (levels 140 Through 180, read below what i did after i discovered how the game was played :))  Get ready to waste your mousebutton and both hands. The faster you click, the faster you go through the game.  you start with nothing, click to hit a monster, click several times to waste it.  10 monsters per level, every 5 levels, a boss. Then a timer starts, you got 30 seconds to get rid of ridiculous amounst of hitpoints. The you can get hero's to click for you...Damage Per Second... Slay a monster, get money, classic hack and loot.. buy levels for your heroes to get enormous bonussen to DPS and clicks.  sounds easy? It is! Still the game has enough dept with magic items, ancient souls, hero souls and special abilities you gather during the game to do even more damage...think decillions of damage..  When you'll find it harder to get past the normal levels, after al while, you can Restart...every time this happens, you gather souls for more bonus, to get you past these levels...onto more difficult levels to pass...and so you go round and round and faster and faster... The is no limit...and to get beyond it, you'll have to start over and over again..and again..  I would only recommend this game when  - you're not sensitive to any addictions - you have no wife - you have no kids - you have plently of time - you have no life, other than to ravage your mousebutton..  STRATEGY SPOILER&gt;&gt;&gt; how i did it..after i clicked 500000 times.. (how it should be done)  1st time:  get ready to click... get to level 120, buy as much levels for every hero to get around 10 souls when you ascend the first time. dont buy ancients...yet...the bonus 10% per soul is much bigger than the bonus from ancients at this stage..  You will notice that with a 100% damage bonus, you will get past the first set of levels much more easily...  Now try to make it to level 120...buy as many levels as possible and hope for extra souls from primal bosses. ascend... again and again.. enough gems? buy 3 guilds,   when you get past level 140 things slow down... gather as much souls as possible untill you reach 200 souls...never go below this amount.  now try to buy CHRONOS level to 3-4-5 and SIYALATAS level to 20, buy some other totems if you like..but dont spend more souls on ancients if it takes you below 200..  the go for 400 souls... In the mean time, try gathering Magical items that increase the chance of primal souls...  frostbite level 75? after level 140... start with treebeast and level him to 1000... then the next.. if you have got several guild bonusses, you can level these heroes as well..every 25 levels damage goes 4X... the samoerai is pretty strong...in this phase of the game..  level 160 and 165 are hard...for the money you get... i stopped at this point almost every time..to get past you have to leave the game @ level 159... than upgrade per 25 levels...try to see which one is the best buy...  because you start over and over...you gather 10-30 gems per ascension..untill you have 400 and the descibed levels..  when goin into clickmode..you can easily slay beyond 150---do this to get the free guilds every 10 levels..but dont go to the max every time... i had runs with only Omeet as 1 primal soul...the next run you end up with over 30 on bosses alone..  try yo reach level 200 more often...the boss has 8 souls..every time..  Then leave the game for the night beyond level 240...you might have to click to get beyond te last few bosses... by that time you level heroes per 25 levels for 10 ^ 35... when you get there, you get beyond 10 ^40 over night....  The first 6 heroes are beyond level 1000...by that time...  Rearrange guilds, some heroes are weaker, and not needed...select samoerai, treebeast, mercedes...to concentrate 4-6 guilds in them.. it really helps if other heroes are guilded as well..keep at least 1 guilded and 2 not guilded... be carefull...it cost 2 souls per time...only do this if you go to level 150 faster than 20 minutes.  Enjoy :)",

You get in, and right away, you're reminded of Cookie Clicker, 'Oh, it's one of those', you say, but give it a shot anyway because this is a cute new reskin with epic music and a fantasy theme.  Then you start buying heroes. Cid is a good enough gal, but she just makes one click equal two, no big deal. But the moment you get your first DPS hero, Treebeast, you find yourself leaping off into a game of far more mechanics and bonus numbers than you anticipated not too long ago from this Cookie Clicker 'clone'.  You get these heroes, all different, unique, with their own different upgrades. Most of them give that hero straight DPS, but others give you more gold, or boost your friends, or grant you special abilities to really shake up your screen. You push the limits of how far you can go, until it seems like each monster takes an hour and you simply don't have the gold to get stronger... Reset time - You reset, and suddenly the world is like new, but you're much stronger now. You might even enlist the help of the gods to follow you between resets, making each new game faster and stronger than the last.  This is your standard idle-game... with so much more.",

The game's most noticeable feature is how losing on standard enemies is absolutely impossible, the only way you can lose is to Boss battles (as they are timed), so you'll have to defeat older enemies many times to grind power-ups and defeat the Boss. Repeat this every 5 stages and you get most of the game, the fact that it can run in background and litterally play itself is pretty incredible and amusing (even when your PC isn't running, just go to sleep and the next day you'll be able to witness the gigantic amount of money your helpers have gaigned when you were asleep; wich is always somehow surprising...).",

There is nothing to do in this game, it is in no way fun because the fun is really just clicking on monsters to upgrade your ability to click better. Sure other games are 'Click in the bad guy to shoot him and get better guns to shoot the other bad guys with' but atleast those types of games make it difficult to shoot the bad guy, or have a good story to go with shooting the bad guy. But this game has nothing stimulating to keep you engaged.  Fun fact: The definition of game; - something you can play, usually with a set of rules The definition of play - an activity for fun or relaxation  Well it certainly doesn't fufill the 'fun' part, and it would be more relaxing to spend the same time sitting in a comfortable chair, and if the chair is near a computer and you don't want a serious game, serach the web for a free flash game, or play on a handheld device.",

I was very happy to see they had added a ton of content since my previous play - mercenary recruitment and questing, relics (equipment), clans, and a new transcension option which adds another meta layer to the game. Super fun.   This game is great for the casual player and the numerophile. Best clicker and best f2p game I've seen.",

Back then, you had to ascend (Pretty much like prestige, wiping your progress just to get a tiny bonus that keeps stacking the more you keep doing it) over and over again a few times before you were able to get past zone 140 or so, because the price of the Dread Knight was astronomically insane. Lots of us, who hate doing the equivalent of rolling heavy rocks up a hill just to watch them roll down again, just stopped playing here.  After that, they decided to add mercenaries, and my god, this change was amazing. Now, you didn't had to ascend anymore, you could simply send your mercenaries to farm Hero Souls and money, and getting through the zones was pretty much a breeze now. You could also farm those random fish drops in hopes of getting rubies, and you could also send your mercenaries for rubies, too. So, you could skip ascending altogether, just gather enough rubies for a quick ascension, and there you go! I got through zone 200-1800 that way, and it seems like the game was getting a bit too easy, but still, you could finally feel some kind of ♥♥♥♥ing progress.  Then, update 1.0 came. They nerfed lots of ancients, for example, it was quite easy to get Chronos stupidly OP, giving you like an extra 300 seconds for your boss timer if you were an idler like me. They nerfed it so it only gives you around 16 extra seconds or so. But hey! You can level Chronos up now! It's just going to cost you 5 quadrillion souls! For a whooping .22 seconds. So, idling now like in the old days was out of the question. But hey, you could still gather rubies to get another quick ascension, right? Well, yes, but now, there's super ancients basically, that look like Lovecraftian old ones. What's the catch? You HAVE to trASScend to get these, which means you have to wipe your progress. Just ♥♥♥♥ you, you have to wipe your progress if you wanna get far now. And nope, there's nothing you can do to avoid said wipe. So, unless you've got an awful lot of time to spend in this game, getting far is now pretty much a pain in the ♥♥♥. Going from zone 1950 or so all the way back to zone 1 makes me feel like killing myself. And I didn't even got that far compared to other players out there.   This is where I call quits, they just nerfed everything that exists to give you an excuse to grind harder. I know lots of you will love it, and I know I might get lots of hate for my point of view, but that's how I feel at the moment.",

There's some strategy involved if you want to play more actively. Which hero you level first makes a difference in the time you take to advance.

Reason for this is, that with transcension and/or ascension you have to start form Level 1 again. No chance to avoid that and although you cut through the low level with one-hits you still have to come back about every 30 minutes to level your heroes further. So if you are mainly playing idle this will slow you down and i think it was a bad decision to do this the way it is right now.  But what really makes it annoying for me and a reason to stikc to other idle games is the attitude of the team behind clicker heroes, as i'm 'violating' steam voting restriction right now.

It is mindlessness and pointlessness reduced, distilled and dripped through a pippette in the form of inane, twee monsters superimposed over infinite credit tickers. It is almost impossible to imagine a more meaningless game--Indeed, as I have previously alluded to, it is not really a game at all. Although I haven't tried it, I have no doubt that one could garner the same sense of satisfaction dispensed by clicker heroes by simpling multiplying random sums on a calculator to see how many decimal places you can get to.  It really is very, very ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.  It's also together quite evil, because clearly what the developers intend by this game is to turn people into rats at pellet dispensers by exploiting human susceptibility to operant conditoning: ' B.F. Skinner (1938) coined the term operant conditioning; it means roughly changing of behavior by the use of reinforcement which is given after the desired response. Skinner identified three types of responses or operant that can follow behavior.'  The particular type of OC driven by clicker heroes is positive reinforcement wed to RNG type drops for items in game ( rubies). Basically, it's gambling. The idea is that you move from something you would consider unthinkable ( spending real currency on rubies in game) to handing over real money to progress in a game which is utterly pointless, requires absolutely no skill whatsoever and is limitless.  This is of course par for the course with clickers ( rat at pellet dispenser games) and to its credit, clciker heroes does offer means by which to gather Rubies and Hero shards without the use to real currency. Irregardless, it is nonetheless exploitative, boring, pernciously repetitive. It's basically a drag net designed to ensnare those addicted to, or susceptible to, degenerate gambling type behavior.

I'VE DONE IT. Wait, no.. This.. This still isn't what I was born into. World 1.. *Click* Damn.",

Although if you're looking for a game you can actually have fun on then this isn't it but for free I would recommend downloading it and when you go out of the house, leave the game on because it can get very competitive between your friends on how far you and your friends have gotten. It's a lot like the popular app cookie clicker if you know about it. It's also very self-achieving when you have a lot of gold and get upgrades and progress.

The clock keeps ticking, Your mouse keeps clicking, and soon you now realize, The sun is now rising.  Your life is now wasted, Consumed, by this game, So a warning will be given, Turn back; or else.  If you do not comply, Only emptiness you will find. Then before you can say 'Ascension!' Everything you ever valued is gone. The End. ---------------------------------------- 10/10 best poem ever.

Fair Play Game)  Your goals : - kill monsters &amp; bosses in neverending universe - collect gold to hire/level up heroes to kill faster - collect rubies (in-game currency for microtransaction) to summon ancients (persistants bonuses like gold, dps, HS...), gild heroes (damages x2/gild level), Relics x3 (items with bonuses like ancients) - collect heroes souls fighting randomly primal bosses in universe - collect heroes souls doing ascension (Ascension reset universe that mean you loose gold &amp; heroes. But you keep rubies, heroes souls, gilded heroes status.) or quick ascension (no universe reset) - summon ancients to progress faster &amp; deeper  - Heroes gain damages x 4 each 25 levels &amp; x 10 each 1000 levels - Get 1 relic / ascension after level 99 (and after doing 1 ascension at least before current universe) : relics give 1 or many bonuses like ancients and can bypass ancients caps value  You must choose build betwen : - click CD damages need to clik on mobs to kill them (damage &amp; critical) - idle DPS damages auto grind (no need to click on mobs to kill them, no critical) Idle build work offline too.  Randomly appear treasure chest with huge amount of gold and chance to gain 1 or 2 ruby. No need to buy rubies with real money. You can do if you want to support devs.  Despite his simplicity, Clickers Heroes is full strategic game based on maths. You can't progress without planning carefully your progression.   You start on universe 1. All universes are same but primal bosses who give HS as reward appear in random based on spawn rate %. You do run to universe 1. When you'll be stuck (very slow progression), you have to reset universe doing ascension. Ascension reset universe : you loose gold &amp; heroes. But you keep your HS &amp; rubies. You start universe+1 after ascension. The goal about ascension is to do run in universes to grind HS. You always keep your HS, rubies, ancients.

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",

            "review_text": "one day mario woke up and decided to take a ♥♥♥♥ because hey he's mario. so mario went up to yoshi and said 'yoshi i want you to be my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' and since yoshi was mario's ♥♥♥♥♥ he opened his mouth. mario pulled down his stained briefs and began to ♥♥♥♥ in yoshi's mouth. yoshi was forbidden to express any emotions but at this moment he was feeling very aroused. mario's face turned red as he grunted and strained to push his log of ♥♥♥♥ out of his ♥♥♥. he farted and little ♥♥♥♥ particles flew into yoshi's eyes. yoshi's eyes teared up, not from the pain of the ♥♥♥♥ particles nor from the paint-peeling stench coming from mario's unwashed ♥♥♥, but from the sheer ecstasy of being mario's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. mario noticed this and began to grunt harder, teasing the horny beast. mario noticed that yoshi was fiddling around with his dino-wiener, which had become quite erect. 'stop that this instant' commanded mario, noticing his own 2-incher was growing hard as well. yoshi whined and reluctantly lowered his hands. with a final grunt and a smelly fart, mario's log of ♥♥♥♥ finally dropped from his ♥♥♥ into yoshi's mouth. mario turned around and watched as yoshi chewed the ♥♥♥♥ log. 'eat it ♥♥♥♥♥. eat it all' said mario. yoshi pretended he hated doing this so much but his throbbing wiener and moans of joy told mario otherwise. 'swallow it' ordered mario but yoshi didn't want to swallow it yet. he wanted to savor the ♥♥♥♥. 'SWALLOW IT RIGHT NOW' screamed mario as he began wang-slapping yoshi across the face. mario, hands on his hips, thrust his pelvis from side to side across yoshi's face, punishing the naughty dinosaur. 'YOU DO WHAT MARIO TELLS YOU' he screamed. after about fourty wang-slaps his wiener started to become sore so he stopped. by now the ♥♥♥♥ log had gone down yoshi's throat. 'eggulate' he ordered. yoshi strained and produced an egg. inside this egg contained what was previously his ♥♥♥♥ log. mario walked over to his shelf and placed it with the others. he had hundreds possibly thousands of these ♥♥♥♥-eggs. he planned to use these against bowser the next time he kidnapped peach. now there was only one thing left to do. mario bent over and pointed his ♥♥♥ at yoshi who immediately knew what to do. he began to use his tongue to clean mario's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥. mario couldn't hold it back. his peener let loose with some 'italian ranch dressing.' this brought yoshi to an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well. with both their wieners pleasantly limp and tingling they continued with the cleaning process. 'don't forget to thorougly clean the dingleberries from the hairs' mario advised. yoshi obeyed his master. ten minutes later mario decided he was clean and put his clothes back on. now it was luigi's turn with yoshi. 'yo luigi i got him warned up for you' mario called as he walked out of the yoshi room. luigi walked in past him with a sly smile under his mustache and carrying an apple and a hot wheels car. 'hello yoshi guess what time it is again' he said in a low voice as he locked the door behind him. mario walked out into the kitchen ignoring yoshi's squeals of pain and joy, and poured himself a bowl of cereal. unfortunately he had forgotten to purchase milk, but he could improvise. he took out his wiener and peed into his cheerios. mario sat down in front of the tv and began to eat his cheerios and pee while periodically scratching his balls. 'hey these cheerios and pee aren't half bad' mario said out loud and contemplated having another bowl before he realized that he was all out of pee. luigi had now returned, panting and sweating. 'yo luigi let me borrow some of your pee' said mario as he pointed the bowl at luigi's crotch. 'gee mario i don't know what you would want with my pee but sure' said luigi as he unzipped his overalls. luigi filled mario's bowl but still had some more pee left in him. he took this opportunity to mark his territory around the house. first he peed on his side of the couch then he peed on his chair at the dining table. he only had a little pee left so he had to make this last one count. he looked around the room and spotted his brother. he ran up and peed on mario, marking him as his own. 'no one else can have you!' shouted luigi. mario 'accidentally' got some of luigi's pee in his mouth. mario and luigi finished eating their cheerios with pee and decided to go for a walk in the park. they hooked yoshi up to his leash and took turns ♥♥♥♥♥♥ him during the walk to the park. by the time they arrived at the park all three of them were tuckered out and decided to just ♥♥♥♥ in the shade of the big oak tree. it seemed like today was going to be another peaceful day.﻿ ",

The game is a time waster.. very good one.. and became with the last update even MORE time waster. Let me explain. The game is a resource game.. running in real time. You can play it clicking your ♥♥♥ off, play it idle and do nothing at all beside a few clicks every here and then.. or a mix of both.  I played a mix, as sometimes I want to click a bit and other times I prefer to sleep! :p So for 5 days I wasted my time.. and I felt very sorry for myself during game time.. why am I wasting my life with this? Anyhow.. got myself a little setup and reached Lv400 in 50min on my farm run for hero souls. Got about 350 on average on a run. Skilled mainly chance to spawn a Primal Boss and Hero Souls drop amount plus more gold in IDLE mode. I was happy wasting my time... and the update came.. no question, do you want to upgrade? Just suddenly I got way more Hero Souls.. niiiice, what a lucky run.. when I hit over 1k Souls.. I started to understand, something goes different as usual. Bed time.. started game again next day and screen pops up.. Transcence bla bla.. Help Screen to explain it all.. like a lerner driver gets this instruction: Open Door of the car, start car, drive as it is demanded by law, park and exit car. So.. basicly nada! Next I start my run.. why are my heroes not guilded anymore?? Why does all take soooooooo much longer? To make it short.. that is what r2games sold you. We made a upgrade and BALANCED the game. How unbalanced it was before.. example: My next upgrade for chance to get a primal boss was 72 Hero Souls... after the update +86k Hero souls.. so the developper thought it needed a balance to a skill that was 1 : 1200 out of balance. Yes, but we gave you more Hero Soul income too... true.. went from 400 average to 1500 on a run.. lets say 4 time more... to 1200 more cost.. my same farm run of 50min is now over 3 hours... and instead of beeing able to upgrade my chance for hero boss 3 times on one farm run to 400.. I would need over 50 runs for 1 upgrade. So wasting time is one thing, this is just simply super stupid.. I guess to many people came to the end of 'get arthritis when you are old game'.. and instead of putting some brain into it.. they just made everything a s h i t l o a d take more time.  So all in short: If you want to kill your last brain cells with boredom, if you cant understand or play games, which demands at least an IQ of 90.. this is your game and you will LOVE it!!! In any other case.. do yourself a favor, man... drill yourself a hole in your head.. makes more sense than playing this game for brain dead idiots. This is THE game for street cleaners, garbage men and bums living under the bridge.. about the IQ you need to play this junk and think this is a great game..",

I played for two weeks in the middle of college semester. It was a bad choice, you can get really caught up in this crap. I imagine nothing has changed. You can tell by the screen shots that its the same game the whole time.  The monsters don't do anything. You just hit them and they die. The heroes have some abilities that let you do more damage and get more gold. the ancients have some special abilities, which basically let you farm more monsters faster. Hero souls give you more damage. Nothing else to this game.  I imagine in about a few months this game will have negative reviews. It's fun at first, but it's not a game you play.

However sometimes it can become repeative and as soon as you have so many people at high levels you actually lose one the factors of the game which is control soon enough you won't have to do anything even though this effect worked in things like Cookie clicker it doesn't (At least for me) hold up in the way Cookie clicker has and as you can see I only have an hour on this game as I feel it would work better on a phone/tablet rather than a computer as it is something as a time waster or something to do when your bored.

The game is good and you can spend a lot of time on it, but after a while it just takes so long to progress that it's not worth just watching the game and waiting until you can spend 25 levels in a hero to get 4x bonus damage. You're better off playing an idle build or getting a clicker to play the game for you. Trust me, when you try to get to zones 3000+ for the first time, I doubt you'll want to do a 300 000 click combo or wait in front of your screen for 20 hours.  The game has been updated a few times already since its release on Steam so the developpers are active. I honestly don't think the updates have been too great, but at least it's still new content that can be improved later.  Also, it's free, and while you can spend money on it, I don't think buying anything will give you any real advantage in the long run. Yeah, quick ascensions are good, but you've got a lot of money to spend on a free game if you want to buy enough for it to matter in the long run.  The main problem I think is that, like any incremental game, it does get old after a while. I have spent near 400 hours on this game and I am kind of tired of playing it, simply because it's just the same thing every time. I open it up from time to time when I'm watching a tv show or something so I can level up my heroes during breaks, but other than that I don't really feel like playing it that much anymore. However, for a free game, I think spending nearly 400 hours is more than enough to say that the game is good.",

Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.  In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.  Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.  Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!  Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.  Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.  Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).  Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!",

Like with this game and AdVenture Capitalists it does have the feature to keep getting gold/money even if you are offline. There are a lot of levels in this free to play game and bosses at every 5 or 10 levels. And if you are not powerful enough to kill that boss then you have to stay on the lower level to gain enough gold to upgrade warriors. Very fun game for somewhat easy achievements and also waste a few minutes/hours on.",

            "review_text": "After seeing several of my steam friends trying out Clicker Heroes I thought that I should give it a shot since it was a free to play game. Clicker heroes is a minimalist idle rpg. after trying out for about eight hour (most of which was spent with the game just running in the background waiting for monsters to die 40 times to unlock the next boss) I find myself bored with the game. The level designs is a cutesy monster on a changing square platform that flinches whenever somone clicks it. I've noticed about fifteen different styles of monsters so far and about 20 different colored platforms/backgrounds in 110 levels. The game music is highly repetive 30 second loop, and the clicking design can leave to a quick burst of finger cramps every ten minutes. Is there a story? Not really your some dude hiring other dudes to help kill monsters and you use the money that is earned to make them more powerful. The bosses hp scales dramatically forcing the player to arbitrally collect X amount of gold to level up/unlock new heroes upgrades and abilities before the player can advance. Combine this game design with a built in micro transaction system (for money and buffs) and you have a formula for a player to log in, spend money earned, use cool downs to defeat a boss, slay fourty monesters to unlock the next boss, then spend hours either afk with the game running, or closing out the game to do other stuff and coming back the next day to spend money, level up guys, buy skills, etc.   Do I recommend this game? Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. This game isn't for me. The experience isn't that engaging, the story is barebones, graphics minimalistic, and game play is highly repetive. The most fun I had with this was from the accouting perspective of the game and figuring which skills/upgrades were the most effective to purchase and waiting in anticipation of what the next unlock will be.",

You constantly feel the need to hit the next breakpoint, but it never actually comes, as both you and the monsters are gaining power exponentially. But the numbers are getting bigger, so it must be going somewhere, right?  Clicker Heroes is nothing more than an endless dopamine trickle, which is habit forming in basically the same way smoking cigarettes is, and about as rewarding ultimately. It's very well made, and I'll admit the concept is pretty brilliant in a cynical way, but I really don't recommend anyone play it, as it is actually tangibly making the world a worse place by existing.",

The satisfaction we derive from 'upgrading' and 'leveling up' has a power over us, and Clicker Heroes is a fantastic exhibit of that - it's a great insight into what makes games addicting and compelling, what keeps us playing. It's like a stripped down explication of our brain's reward system; it's a video game version of straight dopamine.  One minor complaint - THERE'S ONLY ONE SONG.  10/10 - Free, addicting, clever, mindless, possibly unintentionaly insightful and philosophical.",

You can still click away to kill things faster or just let the computer do it for you.  As things die, they drop money. You use the money to upgrade and buy new heroes. Every 5 levels there's a boss to contend with that has massive amounts of HP that requires you to grind out gold for more upgrades until you get a sufficient amount of DPS to deal with the boss.  It's not hard. It's practically mindless and I think that's the beauty of it. You don't have to think. You just play. People see what you're doing and ask about it, you explain it and they look at you like you're an idiot...but if you get them to try it they're hooked! It's silly. It's nonsensical.

Over all...  6/10  While it's not bad, and has a bit more depth then most clickers, the rather lack of different mobs out there to fight, along with the dragged on levels that go just a bit too far weaken the game.

This has impressed me so much that I dropped a fiver on rubies now that I've got money - hopefully this encourages other developers to follow the same model.  As for the gameplay, let's be honest - it's a clicker. It has some neat pictures and neat little stories, but those get old after the first few times. The real draw is the interesting rebirth/ascension/etc. system that lets you tweak your game in a direction that fits your gameplay style - you spend your ascension currency (hero souls) on various 'ancients' that have in-game effects - anything from boosting the effect of a particular skill to a flat DPS boost. Sure, there are ideal builds, but if you're into doing everything by the numbers... well. I pity you. :p",

Very soon you will notice that there is more depth to it and it's not just about constant clicking until your finger is ready to be amputated.  The main problem is the current ascension mechanic (soft reset to LVL1, to be able to use the harvested hero souls), which becomes very grindy after doing it over 10++ times, I hope the developers implement an option to automate or bypass/boost the process until you have reached your desired area LVL.  Maybe an option to record an 'ascension session' and appy the process to the next ascend. Shouldn't be a big deal. because the savegames already calculate the collected loot, while you are beeing offline.  At the moment I can recommend the game only to a certain 'grind level' after that it becomes extremely grindy.",

It's not a game for everyone, but as someone with an endless love for watching arbitrary numbers getting bigger and bigger, this is a game I probably won't tire of for a while.",

The one bad part of this game, or any clicker out there, is the grind. In order to beata hard boss, you will just go back to a few levels behind, and then sit there for 30-40 minutes, trying to raise the DPS and overall damage of your charachters. This cycle will repeat around every 5 levels (10 minutes of game time). If you are willing to aim for achievements, you are gone.  Good,   simple   game. Clicker buff?   Try it.   Otherwise pass",

It's gameplay also has a really pleasant mix of either being active, idle, or a mix of both depending on how you're feeling. The clan system is also really nice, because you can see how you size up to other people online and see how your numbers improve over time.

Having played this since more than a year ago, I can see the many changes that the developers have made over the years based on the feedback given on Reddit and kudos to them for being close to community and really listening to what the players have to say.

Pros: -Tons of levels (10k+) -Tons of different abilities and heroes -2 different playstyles (Not sure if there's more) -Replayability -Clans  Cons: -It may get boring after a while -Can't constantly play since monsters get harder as you level so you just have to turn it off and let it farm (Only at the start of the game)  Overall, I'd say this game is pretty good, it's a simple 'upgrade' game that can keep you playing for hours on end.",

No, but I wouldn't say otherwise either. It's really addicting and is fun in the beginning, but as you progress it starts to get boring. Really boring. The gameplay is simple: Click monsters until they they die and give you money. Use the money to buy stuff that makes you deal more damage. Repeat. See why it gets boring? Oh, and it only takes longer to progress the more you play, which might seem obvious but it only makes the game even more repetive and boring.  Well sure, there also some other stuff in the game, such as finding treasures and 'ascensions' but neither are very intresting ('ascensions' are essentially like prestiege in CoD, or infamy in Payday 2).  How come I have a couple of hours on this game? Well, I load it up at times and play for ~10min until it gets boring again.  Pros: + Can be fun + Okay artwork + Free  Cons: - Microtransactions - Runs in flash = bad performance and 30FPS cap - Repetive - Addicting (I guess this could be positive) - Small amount of content - After you're come to level ~140 upgrading your heroes/buying new ones gets really expensive and it takes ages to afford them (unless you get a autoclicker)",

I have played a very striped down version of having an Adventure but more in the imagination because that game was only Buttons, it only had buttons, Kill monsters with only a button and have some text, Level up, and repeat that. That's kind of what Clicker Heroes is, but you have the Clicker/Mathmatics format and visuals of killing monsters and all they drop is mountains of gold! I believe we fight them on platforms because the worlds were mined of all gold material.  Also my hours are actually 80+ but my internet goes out randomly. So the game is playable offline. Yeah 80+ hours straight... Non stop!  The progression with gaining currency and DPS (without Reseting also constantly playing) is good up untill, Dread Knight, it costs 10,000u, even with a total of 16h play you wouldn't come close to that amount even with high level upgraded Hero's. That's the point you will be forced to reset your game and rank up the hero levels (every 2,000 levels gives 1 hero souls like 10,000 levels total will give 5 HS). Right then the game intentionally forces the player to wait FOREVER or Reset. Though that's not the point, you have to reset in clicker games to get benifits. But that felt unfair to be forced to reset my current world. That's the biggest negitive to make it feel even more like another grindy clicker game.   You can put money into this game but you could also just earn the Ruby currency though RNG-Fish-Orange's. Yes it's a Fish with the Orange Fruit body. But, you will have to reach a sertaint zone level in order to get the pop up for the Ruby cash shop, these devs just designed this game very creativly. (Fish are friends, AND food! - altered-quote from Finding Nemo)  Get the x2 damage multiplier forever and Gild your heros, those are forever and will help you go through levels/zone levels faster after reseting. Gilding can apply to a single hero multiple times but it is RNG, Gilding gives +50% damage.  Yes this game is pointless, you will become a Zombie. But as a clicker it's one of the better ones to invest time into and very well coded and designed, it functions as it should. The format for the numbers is very easy to understand what is lower or higher there really is no need to mod CH (Idk if it is possible to Mod) because the game gives great benifits for just playing, reseting, ect, it has good reward for progression. Also you cannot SLOWLY painfully cheese your way through boss levels because there is a (at minimum) 30s timer to kill the boss. Bosses are every 5 levels so it is easy to memorise how far back or forward you want to go, also they are the most stable way to obtain currency, thus easy farming.  The game won't be for everyone but I do see amazing things happening from this game.  On a personal note I at one point wished I was playing Billion-GoldCoin-Pick-Up in Skyrim, kill monsters and they litter gold coins all over the ground when killed. If you are obsessed with picking up Gold Coins, play this game and tolorate how repetitive it becomes.  For a clicker type game, 6.8/10",

            "review_text": "Short Review (for the impatient) Best game in the idle-genre/category right now. Still with active development going on and gameplay lasting you for an immeasurable amount of time (probably years, if you tried that hard).   Following the long review.  Random Introduction Have played it on Kongregate before, then on Playsaurus, then on mobile... and now on Steam. Even tho you can earn cash currency ingame much easier on Kongregate than you can on Steam (thanks to including manually opened advertisements), i have grown to like the Steam version more since it tracks the time i have spend on this game. Which is at the time of writing my most played game, even excluding Final Fantasy XI (where Steam doesn't track the time at all, but character playtime ingame does). Current playtime of Clicker Heroes: 423 hours.  The Game itself It is a typical idle-game where you start out by clicking a monster to death, then another and another and endless more. Then you upgrade heroes to do this job for you, coming back every now and then to either click yourself some more or upgrade your troops of heroes. After doing this for about 100 zones, you will start gaining the next currency by starting over and becoming stronger once again, doing this a few times you will blast through the first yyy zones in a matter of minutes. Now there are also Ancients, Relics, Raid bosses, guilds (that fight those raid bosses) and the more recent addition of another form of restarting the game: transcending. IAP (in-app purchases) can be neglected and are not necessary, since you earn cash-currency (in this one rubies) by waiting in front of the screen and clicking the appearing 'clickable bonus' (it looks like a fruit, fish or ruby depending on the time of year), there is a good chance you will earn 1-2 rubies this way each time (which quickly becomes 100+ if you play 'actively' daily).   Conclusion What really sets this game apart from other idle-games is the sheer amount of content to play through, it's very balanced gameplay and certainly the art-style previously used in Cloudstone (also by Playsaurus). If you played an idle game before give this a try, if you haven't it is certainly one of the best to start with.   Legacy It has pretty much become the archetype how idle-games should be and even spawned a self-made clone by the developer named Ragnarok Clicker (Clicker Heroes with the graphics and music of Ragnarok Online). And a huge amount of clones by other developers.",
