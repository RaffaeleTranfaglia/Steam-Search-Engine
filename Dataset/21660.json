I HATE the pop song that plays in the main menu and I HATE Seth. That cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I've only been able to defeat him using Zangief so far. With my amazing, god-like skills mind you. One thing I hate as well is, in case of Zangief, that I never seem to be able to pull off his Ultra combo. He ALWAYS performs his Super. What's up with that ? Like I can't press the same button 3 times in a row really fast. No, I'm not physically challenged. Dear SFIV, I spit on you ! ... ... No, I didn't mean that ! Come back, please ! Fine, fine, I'll be playing Super Street Fighter IV then. Let's see how that works out...  [Rating: 80/100]",

It is said to be more accessible to casual gamers than previoous versions of Street Fighter, and I agree. However, I wouldn't venture onine with this until you have a strong understanding of core game mechanics. Game controller or joysticks are all but required to play - computer keyboard will do you no justice. Great game to have around for the 10 minute game session or when you have friends over.",

The controls are not that great and even the gameplay and difficulty are needed to be set on very easy just to enjoy the game. The AI is also very annoying as it has repetetive moves all the time. I wouldn't reccomend buying this game, I bought it to play with my friends but I didn't enjoy it. If you want a SF title just buy the Arcade or Ultra edition.",
