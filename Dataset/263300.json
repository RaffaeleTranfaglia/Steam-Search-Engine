            "review_text": "  SHORT VERSION   Do you like great fighting games? If you answered yes, then go get it. It's a good buy.    LONG VERSION   BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a 2D fighting game, and the first entry of the BlazBlue franchise followed by Continuum Shift and Chrono Phantasma.  Calamity Trigger features 12 fighters, each with their unique gameplay, strengths and weaknesses.  As a fighting game it's important to mention that the game can be played excellent on keyboard without any trouble. The combos are fairly easy, and you will always find new ways to chain them into better ones. The controls are responsive and there's no delay at all. Graphics wise the game looks gorgeous: the 2D sprite models are looking good, and blend well into the 3D background, while animations are smooth and beautiful as well. Aside from the usual story mode, there is an Arcade mode for every character, mini-games and tons of unlockable artworks to keep you busy for a long time!  However like most games, Calamity Trigger has its' flaws too: first off the Developers removed the multiplayer, though it was part of the game for the Games For Windows Live release, and second the game tends to have 30 FPS limit sometimes due to a bug. To fix the 30FPS limit you have to restart your PC, aside from this issue, the game runs smooth with 60FPS cap.   Overall Blazblue: Calamity Trigger is an amazing fighting game. I can highly recommend this to anyone, whether you're new to fighting games or a veteran in the genre. And as a Guilty Gear/Blazblue fan is a no-brainer to buy, since it increases the chance of seeing more recent games from the developers on Steam!     PRO   - Graphics are beautiful. The 2D sprite models seemlessly blend into the 3D background. - Animations look smooth and polished. - Soundtrack is amazing. - The game features 2 different language voice acting: Japanese and English. Both are solid. - Controls are responsive. The game plays smooth. Combos are easy to pull off. Can be played with keyboard without any difficulties.     CONS   - Lack of multiplayer. - Occational 30 FPS cap bug. To fix the FPS limit you have to restart your PC. - Steam cloud doesn't work, though it's shown on store page.",

            "review_text": "First of all, Blazblue's one of my favourite fighting games/franchises of all time since I played it on PSP years ago and I've played all kinds of fighting games since Street Fighter EX2 Plus (if I remember correctly) so I would highly recommend it to any fan of the genre. Most negative opinions about the game (from myself n others I guess) are mainly due to knowledge of the better sequels that are not available on PC (yet?) It feels like we're being told to be grateful for having anything at all. Thanks to Arc System Works I can cry myself to sleep...  Note: I would have a lot more hours if my PC didn't currently have problems n bluescreen when I played some games :/ but I played lots before Steam version. I type a lot :l  Tl;dr (too long; didn't read): read bold text.  Valve:  bold text needs to be bolder.   Graphics: I put this first 'cause of the game's description of being the first hi-res 2D game, I find this particularly awesome (in all modern 2D fighting games) 'cause these games use pixel art whereby characters and most in-game elements are drawn pixel by pixel and char/sprite animations are done via the same way as GIF images that play according to button input. I'm only assuming this is still how it works today and although I think KOFXIII's pixel art is more godly  Blazblue does a great job in keeping the characters alive throughout the battle &amp; making beautiful, fun and non-distracting stages. Animations are smooth and special effects/attacks are pretty. You also get a wide variety of colour palettes when picking a character , more than most other games I've played, just remember to press start when selecting char. The UI/main menu is also very nice &amp; simple.  P.S. You can skip pretty much all loading screens - just press start - how awesome is that!   Gameplay: For those not very familiar with fighting games, one thing to note is the main difference between 3D &amp; 2D fighting games (IMO) is the pacing. Blazblue: Calamity Trigger incorporates this very well for me;  it's very fast-paced and requires almost if not constant input and quick response (in a good/hard match). The basic mechanics are very simple. Main input commands are 'weak attack', 'medium attack', 'strong attack' and 'drive' which is a special attack/ability that is unique to each character. Characters don't have a very large skill set but as with many 2D fighting games you can kinda make your own combos  as you get used to the mechanics, making efficient use of your 'drive' &amp; your position. There are  many levels of difficulty to use to your advantage ranging from 'very easy' to 'hell mode'  so you can go from absolute beginner to master I guess :D and the AI is nothing to laugh at either.  Button response has about no delay in this game and attack animations are quick  so countering and whatnot are something to look out for (I'm looking at you Hakumen).  Each character has about 2 super moves and one 'Astral' move, astral moves are highly animated finishing moves that must be unlocked for most chars and can only be used under certain circumstances, rendering you high with joy when you get to use them.   Story (mode): There is an arcade mode and a story mode, each with different endings for each character. First thing that really gave this game a unique identity to me was the  story mode, it plays out like a Visual Novel until you come across trouble and have to fight your way through. The narrative is written very well with no linguistic errors (Engrish) and all dialogue said by any character is fully voiced and it is done absolutely well! You have the option to choose b/w English and Japanese voices  and although I would normally go with Japanese,  BB's English cast seem so perfectly fit for it and do a great job . Each character has their own story which includes most of the other characters (if not all) and  there are at least 2 routes/endings to each story. There is also additional dialogue/extra sequences if you're defeated and sometimes it triggers an alternate route/ending . To reach 100% completion you have to lose &amp; win against each opponent. Tip: Basic sequence is - save game&gt;fight&gt;lose (game over)&gt;load game&gt;fight&gt;win&gt;repeat for 100% story completion. The story itself can be very confusing at first, depending on the order of characters you play in story mode, but overall I love it! Synopsis is available in game description :/  Characters: BB's weakness, as the beginning of a fighting game franchise, is the no. of available chars.  There are 12 characters readily available to play with (including the boss/es), each very unique in design and fighting styles . Overall theme is very steampunk.  The character relationships are interesting and show in-game during a fight  (through dialogue &amp; pre-battle sequences). Later installments of BB add a lot of characters as well as some additions to existing characters' attacks.  Overall, I think the characters, their backgrounds and personalities, are more interesting than the main story  and they're sorta what make it what it is.  Note: although later games have a lot more to offer, they kept changing artists for the character cards (what you see in the loading screen before a fight/the VS screen) and I think Calamity Trigger has the best artwork among all Blazblue titles. Noel Vermillion &lt;3  Chronos Phantasma is great too but Continuum Shift's art is the worst IMO, wish we could get BB:CP next :/  Music: It's Badass!  Aside from the main theme, ending credits theme ('Limited again', one of my faves), menu and whatnot, each character has their own fitting theme music  and if you set bgm to auto it will play the theme of your opponent (iirc, or the stage, I'm not too sure).  The soundtrack is essentially a great mixture of heavy metal &amp; orchestral music  and as it is downloaded with the game (in the directory), you can add it to your music library.  Extras: There's a large gallery to unlock which includes concept art, character art, arcade end scenes &amp; a few videos.  You can also unlock 'unlimited mode' versions of characters by completing arcade which is a slightly powered up version of the character that you can set when selecting characters for vs battle  (not sure about arcade battle). There is also a comedic story-like tutorial about BB's world accessible within story mode called 'Teach me miss Litchi'. BTW, I highly dislike this game's opening, mainly because the one on PSP was far better IMO.  The PSP version's opening had the same video (second video up there) but used the arcade music from the first trailer up there on the store page ('Calamity Trigger'), it was so badass and much more fitting than this song  (see on youtube)...I used to watch it everytime on PSP but I must skip it on PC.   Special element:  One of the best things about BB (IMO) is the  special element of immersion in the game, characters are lively &amp; have a lot of dialogue within a battle + unique dialogue for certain characters. There are also some special animations before a battle between some characters . This makes it more fun and interesting when you listen to their insults &amp; comments while you fight. This adds tension and/or enjoyment to the already exciting battles. The normal dialogue in a fight also adds so much more, like characters saying 'Saw that!' n 'Missed!' when you dodge/block/counter.  I just love how there's so much effort &amp; personal touches put into this intoductory title.   Peace.",

            "review_text": "If you're a fan of fighting games, you should definitely play BlazBlue series. BlazBlue is a fine series with a complicated story. Story itself is mainly told through images and voiced text, there are no 3D cutscenes or anime-style movies. The main Gameplay is very complicated and takes a long time to master, however BlazBlue Calamity Trigger is a Single-Player Only title. If you're looking for competitive multiplayer, you should buy Continuum Shift version.  I'd highly recommend Calamity Trigger to all Fighting Games fans simply because of the amazing story and intriguing gameplay. Soundtrack is one of the best too and you would be getting it for free, what a bargain!",

            "review_text": "As a fan of Arc System Works' previous Guilty Gear games, and also having watched  BlazBlue: Alter Memory  [myanimelist.net] , I've long been meaning to give BlazBlue a shot. I'm a fairly casual fighting game player and mostly play Street Fighter, but I found BlazBlue easy to get into, and I love how uniquely each character plays. Ragna feels like a pretty standard melee character and is a good way to get used to how to the game works, but then you also get characters like Nu, who doesn't play like anything I've ever seen before, with a focus on ranged attacks without the use of complex inputs. The cast is a little smaller than I'd like, but this is unavoidable due to the age of the game; unfortunately we have yet to see any PC ports past the first game.  The art and sound design are also top-notch, just as they were in Guilty Gear, though this game is considerably more modern and much prettier graphically than the even more aged Guilty Gear titles available on PC. Game runs well too, with a pretty steady 60 FPS even on my fairly weak machine. There's no online multiplayer, but for someone like me who tends to get walked all over online in fighting games by the people who play the game more seriously, that's fine by me. In addition to the arcade mode, which does have little clips of story here and there, there's also a full-fledged story mode that plays out like a visual novel and adds some content to help keep things from getting stale.  Overall BlazBlue is probably going to be my go-to fighting game going forward. It's not perfect, but I've been enjoying my time with it immensely (especially Noel's combos, my God). The only thing this game is missing as far as I'm concerned is  BANG BANG BANG BANG BA-BANG!  If that song played every Bang fight, no, every fight, no, at all times, I would be a happy man.  EDIT: So I just realized that one of Bang's specials does actually change the battle music to that song for the rest of the match. Good enough. And here I was worried it wasn't in the game because it wasn't in the soundtrack files included alongside it.",

            "review_text": "Blazblue: Calamity Trigger is the first in the trilogy, and it shows. For a proper review of Calamity TRigger, id recomend reading a different review than this one, as i will only be talking about the PC Port.  For a PC Port, Calamity Trigger does a decent job. They include some key features, such as a good amount of Resolution options, Anti Aliasing, Bloom and sound options. Its a sprite based fighting game, so there isnt really that much to change when it comes to the visual options.  The framerate is quite off though. My PC is not exactly top tier, but its definetly not low tier either. Mid tier, ive gotten drops to 45FPS which is really bad in a fighting game. Other than that, the game usually runs at a solid 60FPS.  The game also doesnt handle Alt+Tabbing out of the game that well, as ive seen the sprites bugging out by doing so. This can range from completely dissapearing or the colours being completely off.  There is no online, though i personally dont feel this matters. Calamity Trigger is an old game, and the balance is VERY off. Multiple characters has 1 hit kill combos/setups, so going online you probably wouldnt be having that much of a good time. The game does allow for Local 1v1, so if you want to play with friends, there is that option.  The Story is good. Its done in a Visual Novel style, and should take about 10-20 hours to go through, depending on how much of a completionist you are. It does have 'Supposed to lose' fights, so in a few fights you actually fail when you win. The game also has some fights which require a 'Distortion Finish' which is basically requires you to win with a Super move. Both of these got changed in the later installments of the series, except for a select few matches where distortion/Astral finish was required.  Id say, if you buy this game, dont buy it for a Fighting Game solely. Buy it if you are interrested in the story of Blazblue and possibly want to see the rest of the games ported to PC. As a fan of the series, id say its worth it. You also get the soundtrack which is amazing. Its a mix between Instrumental Rock and Vocal remixed versions of the instrumental songs(Lyrics are in Japanese).",

            "review_text": "While I've been a fan of this series ever since my friend told me about it a couple years ago, I never actually played any of the games due to not having a PS3 or an Xbox 360. I know that this game was on PC over in the UK and on GFWL and such, but I never bothered to get that since I didn't feel like it was worth it, not to mention the price. So when I saw this on steam, I jumped at the chance. I DID take a look at the steam information on this game and I still bought it. So let's get on with the good and the bad.   Pros : -  Graphics . I really like the sprites and detailed backgrounds in the stages. I'm not the sort of guy who thinks games are only as good as their graphics. Not at all. But the game's graphics is a plus for me. -  Awesome music . I think everyone already knows that pretty much every game has at least some good music. Fighting games generally have awesome music. You get the OST when you buy this game and it's so worth it. -  Length . I've played 9.6 hours as of this review, and I'm not even halfway done with the story. The story has branching paths depending on whether you win, lose, win with a distortion/astral heat, or choose different options in the story when the choice arises (There's a guide in the community hub to help you get 100% on all character's stories). There's only three characters that have an astral heat when you first start the game. To get the others, you have to beat arcade mode with the character you want the astral heat for. You can also unlock Unlimited mode for characters, which just makes them more powerful, by having more speed, power, modified distortions, etc. That also adds a bit more to the length. Beside that, there's also score attack to do and the gallery to complete if you wanted to do those things. -  Price . You get all of this for $10. I think I got like at least $20 worth from playing some of the character's stories and listening to the OST alone.   Cons : - No online play . For me, I don't really care too much that this game doesn't have online versus. I know that fighting games are really all about playing against someone else and most places don't have a local fighting scene. However I will say that online play is never recommended for top play. It's fine for beginner-intermediate play, but there's always some sort of latency that to play extremely competitively online in a fighting game is sort of absurd. But while I don't care too much that it's offline only, I still would've liked to see it have online. H2 Interactive might be able to implement it in the future. -  Bugs . This is a straight port of the GFWL version, so all the bugs on there are also on here. Sometimes your game will be locked at 30 FPS if your computer's been on for a while. This can easily be fixed with a restart. When I first started the game, the FPS was actually locked at around 17 FPS, but again restarting my computer fixed that. There's also a bug for some people where story mode does not have music at all. If you alt+tab out of the window and come back in, sometimes the characters' sprites will be invisible or have weird hitbox colors. These can usually be fixed if you alt+tab again or have the sprites change (either by hitting, getting hit, or anything else that changes the sprites). Same thing happens in story mode's cutscenes. Alt+tabbing will usually make the character completely invisible, or partly invisible, and the only way for that to be fixed is if the character moves somehow due to an event in the story. But it'll only happen for that one scene you alt+tabbed out of. It may also crash on certain parts, I've read about how some people are crashing after clearing score attack but I haven't played that mode yet. -  Controller support . Despite it saying Full controller support, it only fully supports Xbox controllers and anything using Xbox. My PS2 controller doesn't work, but my Madcatz TE Xbox 360 stick  does work . For any other controllers, you'll have to find a way to emulate the Xbox 360 controller or maybe use one of those controller mapping programs. I have no experience with those so I'm just glad I got an Xbox 360 stick instead of a PS3 one (Though I would very much like to have one still). - Not entirely beginner-friendly . There's absolutely no tutorial on what you can do. There  is  a manual if you right click the game and read it (but who really does that? I didn't even know about it until I right clicked it once). So you'll have to either go into training mode and test out your things or read a guide or something. Basically each character has a light attack, medium attack, and heavy attack, recognized as A, B, and C respectively. Each character also has a Drive attack, recognized as D. Every single attack also has a forward+ action, so if you hold forward and press A, B, C, or D, you'll do a different attack than just pressing A, B, C, or D by itself. Same thing for in the air, though I believe it depends on certain characters. Arakune, for example, has a down+A/B/C attack in the air. Pressing A+B at the same time gives you a barrier block, which is different from a normal block, obviously. There's also an instant block and instant barrier block, if you block about 8 frames before an attack connects. B+C is your grab attack. A+B+C consumes 50 heat, and allows you to cancel a move. A+B+C+D is your burst, which lets you get out of a combo. Not recommended to use early in the round, since you won't have a barrier gauge and will be in Danger status until the round ends. However, definitely recommended if you're supposed to lose in story mode to get a certain scene or path.  Overall, I would still recommend this game. If you have never played a BlazBlue game but wanted to, I'd say go for it. If you want to experience the story, go for it. If you want to get familiar with BlazBlue games, go for it (Although each new game changes something). Despite the cons, I still really enjoyed the game and will enjoy it for many more hours to come. The story and OST alone are worth the $10, I'd say.",

            "review_text": "People told me not to buy it, because it seemed horrible because of its 2D sprites and practically no one I know has heard of it. Didn't care, and I bought it.   Money was worth it.  Interface/Menu: 5/5 - The menu was original and was layed out very well. There's not much more than I can say about it, because the menu is pretty self explanatory, you've got your training button, arcade, story, exit button, score attack, and gallery. The music is very well made, thanks to Daisuke Ishiwatari. The circle layout in the select character screen fits the way the game works. I like the part where the random select is in the middle, which wasn't that self explanatory, I had to figure that out.   Gameplay: 4/5 - The gameplay is fluid and pretty simple, yet hard in some ways. You've got your weak, medium, hard, and drive attacks (A,B,C, and D), just like Injustice. Combo stringing is very open, as practically anything goes (An A,B,C will work for most characters). The mechanics are kind of hard to learn, such as the air recovery, ground recovery, barrier break, throw escapes, negative warning, and the barrier bar underneath each character's health. However, every character, except for Tager, has a double jump and air dash. This is one major part in the game, just like ground hits. There's also distortion drives and astral heats or finishes. These are moves that take 50%-100% of your heat bar. They perform stronger attacks, and your astral heat, always taking 100, will do a finisher, which is a nice touch to the game, adding some variety to the characters. For instance, with one character, you slice them with a scythe and then stab them with a sword, or on another character, you put them in an ice cage. Some characters have special distortion drives, like pushing you and your opponent, or even causing firey attacks, allowing you to go into a more powerful mode.   Story: 5/5 - The story is solid. However, in some cases, it doesn't all make sense. The stories intertwine with each others quite nicely, and even I haven't finished all of it. The cutscenes are nice, however not very fulfilling. The dialogue is very funny. Also allowing customization for the textbox is really neat.  Soundtrack/Music: 5/5 - The music is amazing, and gives BlazBlue the feeling that it needs. It's also included in the BlazBlue folder, allowing me to listen to it in the best quality.  Sprites/Animation: 3/5 - The sprites are good, and every detail is included into them, however the animation isn't all that fluid. However, it's probably the best you can get from a 2D game. However, some animations are fluid, like Rachel ducking and sitting on her cat. Don't complain people, it's the way it works.  Misc: 3/5 - To be honest, multiplayer isn't a BIG thing to me. However, it should be in some fighting games. GWFL's port of BBCT to Steam took out the multiplayer, so it's a singleplayer game, but there's still some hope that this will be added. There's some other bugs that I've heard about, like FPS locking at 30, or sprites disappearing, but it's fixable, so I wouldn't really mind.  OVERALL: 9.7/10 - This is a recommended game. You should get it. Or you can wait for a sale, because that's what I did.",

Overall, good game and good first impression of ASW.  Long story short, I'm a big fan of Arc System's works (ba dum tish) and this game is most likely my favorite. Simple yet creative character designs, great gameplay when your controller isn't broken, and an easy-to-get-into story that actually makes some sense in comparison to other games of the genre (I'm looking at you, Tekken's drawn-out dry storyline).  TL;DR: is a good game, I like",

However despite all of this the core gameplay is left unaltered and retains it's characteristics which seperate it from most other typical fighters such as the diverse character styles and wonderful soundtrack.  Personally I bought this in hopes that some of the other games will be ported considering this is one of the weaker games in the series.

There are some or... 2 .... pretty crap bosses that are pretty hard to beat just like skull girls. if u watch a lot of anime this game is great because of all the different types of characters like lolis,tsundere,and ur average protect my people kind of person. This game has a great sound track that takes up a lot of space......like..10 GB. over all this game a a few fun modes With tons of character colors and stuffs so... BUY IT NOWWW",

The art work is good, the sprites are great, music is amazing, sound/voices are great, combos are great, and unique characters. Despite being old, somewhat unbalanced, small roster, its great to go back to catch up on story, old hitboxs, and look at the changes from the games. Do I recommend it? Well if you want the soundtrack bonus and story, then yeah, get it. If not then you can get the newer ones. Still I enjoy the game, still can't beat Nu-13 without continues sadly...",

            "review_text": "Well I thought I had seen the limits of fighting games but boy was I wrong and I am so happy that I was!  This game introduces a fast paises combat system with a wide veriaty of play styles that will suit different charaters such as toukaka who is a very fast charater darting across the screen landing rapid light hits, with a great design choice by the developers (I think anyway), each and every character has different play styles that requires you to think on your feet when challenging different characters.  Gameplay is not the only thing that this game has going for it, the OST (Original Sound Track) has some just exilerating songs to not only go with the game but a copy of the OST is given with a purchus of the BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger so you can use it with other games and can even be downloaded to you audio listening device.   The Graphics are somthing that I simple just love with dynamic backrounds and amazingly detailed character sprites this game allows for a fresh new experiance that is very different from other fighters like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Guilty Gear, ETC.   This is truely an amazing Japanese Fighter with the highest difficulty being HELL you know you are in for a challenge.  Overall rateing 8.5/10",

Not a very good story but is a good button bashing controller fighting game took a while to get used to  However The final boss on this one is A Danmaku/Ranged Boss that should not of been  included just like azazel off tekken we all know how mch rage comes to us where we are fighting a ranged character with a melee character ,  if i where a dev and made a final boss for a fighting game, id make sure that they are not ranged and spam ranged attacks Whilst all the characters in the story are melee units.  2/5",
