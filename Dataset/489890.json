            "review_text": "I love puzzles, and thought I would buy this game today for those nights that I just cant sleep. I tried to play it and must say it is not what I expected. I managed to get through the first 3 very small puzzles before I shut it down. The gameplay is EXTREMELY laggy and moving the puzzle pieces is annoying to say the least. I tried to find an options tab so that I could tinker with the settings to see if I could fix it and there wasnt any options available. I would hold off on purchasing this game until the Devs work on the game a little more. If you decide to go ahead and buy it, expect to spend at least 10+ minutes putting together a 25-30 piece puzzle that would take a toddler a few minutes to assemble.  Will change rating and review if any updates are ever implimented.",
