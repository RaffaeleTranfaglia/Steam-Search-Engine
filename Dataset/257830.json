    "description": "Dragged by her parents, a young and rebellious teenage girl – Violett, moves to an old spooky house in the middle of nowhere. Forced away from her friends and life in the city; she imagines how boring life in countryside will be: spending day after day, bored in her room with absolutely nothing to do.",

            "review_text": "The graphics are fantastically pretty.  But, that's about all I can wholehearedly endorse about Violett. The best puzzle-adventure games use subtle signalling to show the user what's possible and have a sort of internal logic and consistency. Violett is not really one of these games. There were a number of really nice 'Oh hey, this situation reminds me of this thing I saw a couple rooms back maybe I can use that oh look it worked' bits, but maybe 20% of the time what you were required to do made no sense at all and it just degenerated into 'click random things on the screen until something changes.' Especially the parts where there are several on/off switches strewn about the screen and you get to guess which ones should be set which way.  They probably knew this sort of thing happened, which is why they put in the hinting system. Unfortunately, even if you take the hint for what you're supposed to do there's still no guarantee that you can actually do it: the controls are often fidgety and difficult to get to work with a mouse, something that was especially frustrating in the later parts of the game where you had to actually time actions properly. I'm guessing the controls were actually designed for a tablet of some sort.  The first part of the game is by far the most irritating, due to needing to getting used to the controls and on account of the illustration-based explanation style. Probably they did that in order to avoid needing translation, but sometimes the explanatory illustrations are as mysterious as much of the rest of the game.  Speaking of translation, they clearly didn't get anyone native to look at their English. Fortunately it's all flavor text so you can ignore it.  All that said--it's not actually  bad , so pick it up if it's on sale or something. Just expect to spend the first 30 minutes cursing.  General disclaimer: I don't generally play casual point-and-click games, which  might  account for some of the controls difficulties. I do like and play puzzle solving games.",

            "review_text": "For a point-and-click adventure, you're either going to enjoy this game or you're going to hate it. The initial premise evokes strong deja-vu of Coraline almost to the point of feeling like a blatent ripoff. You play Violett, a goth girl who moves into an old house and finds herself lost in a strange world - complete with a spider antagonist. This is where the simularities end however... as well as the depth of story. Simply put, if you're someone who prefers a heaping dose of narrative and gets annoyed when things are left vague, this game isn't for you. If you don't mind a game that gives you the breadcrumbs and encourages your own interpretations, you'll find an adventure reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland or The Neverending Story.  Each scenery you'll encounter is incredibly imaginitive, from opera singing frogs who can control the weather with their voice, to haunted teapots that torment their owners. The puzzles can be frustrating, but for the most part are never truly illogical. At least, they're generally as logical as a Wonderland-esque world ruled by the phrase 'we're all mad here' is capable of being. The overall aesthetic is unique and (I felt) fascinating. The soundtrack is alright and comes with the game automatically.  And now the bad side. First off, the controls can more often than not be frustrating to deal with, especially if you're moving between several rooms at once. I also encountered some bugs. For example, one achievement failed to pop because one of the criteria glitched and I was forced to start a new game to complete it. Another bug involved ants that forced me to exit and enter the area several times to correct. The 'boss fight' at the end is also a complete joke.  Bottom line, I would say the game is worth looking into if you're a fan of the aforementioned stories, but due to the potential problems with bugs I can't recommend paying full price. Get it during a sale.",

            "review_text": "Edit: After the new hint update, I tried giving it another shot, and it made the game much more playable. I would say it's about 50/50 whether I can recommend this game or not. If you enjoy classic style point and click adventure games, this one may strike a chord with you. However, it's also very frustrating and generally incredibly vague on what you need to do next. There's really no story associated with the game, and the only dialogue is in pictures and garbled voices, so there's no Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle style quips to keep you entertained, and no real cohesion between levels other than you're very small and in a sort of fantasy insect world.  Overall, there have been times when I've enjoyed this game, and times that I've been so frustrated that I turned it off and went and did something else. And unfortunately, the latter has been more prevalent. The graphics in the game are cool, I really like the concepts that the designers came up with. The music is very well done, but it gets a little obnoxious playing on repeat if you get stuck on a certain level for a long time. For the most part it fits in well with the game, though.  I've really enjoyed the design of some of the puzzles, like the cupboard with numbered drawers and the Mole Man water puzzle. However, a lot of the puzzles don't really seem like they're things that make you think, just things that make you click on a lot of different things or give up and use a hint. The elevator with the arrows, for example. I figured out the left and right part easily enough, but I never would have gotten the specific solution if I hadn't used a hint. And there are a lot of puzzles like this, unfortunately. With the updated hint system though, while it hurts my pride to admit defeat, I can still use a hint and get past it instead of being stuck and not being able to play the game any more.  My only compaint about the hints is that if I'm 90% through a level when I get stuck, if I haven't used any hints up to that point, it makes you use the hints in order. I have to use 4 hints just to get help with where I'm currently at. It would be nice if it would keep track of your level progress and grey out or skip hints that no longer apply to you.",

But with no real explanation of what she is actually trying to do, it's hard to figure out what you must do. When one can interact with other chracters, the goal becomes much easier. Diary pages also give hints as to what must be done.",

The controls are a bit wonky and you will have to click things more then once to get them to work sometimes. You do have to be patient with the puzzles as some took me awhile to try and figure out. I do wish there had been an end boss but with that minor detail aside I really enjoyed it. I would suggest to pick it up on sale and definitely give it a try.",

            "review_text": "The game is beautiful. But the logic behind the puzzles' is illogical. Everything is difficult, simply because the solutions are so far from any classic point n click logic, that it's very frustrating. For example, there is a puzzle which involves water and pipes. Violett must activate valves to flow water. But nowhere is there an indication where the source comes from to know which valve does what. Narrowing down what I thought would be the source pipe, turning valves in certain directions doesn't match with other combinations. I had give in and use a guide.  In a nutshell, this game is impossible without a walkthrough.  Story progression is messy and lazy. Off the start, we have no idea why Violett is in her 'Wonderland'. I almost thought I missed a cutscene. Violett meets all these characters which have no personality, and somehow as the player, you're supposed to want to solve their convoluted problems. But you don't know why they want help or have any interest. You just want to get the puzzle done to see more of the game. Then there's the completely pointless hidden object mechanic. You can locate hidden orbs throughout the game - which I'm sure do nothing except give you an achievement - no idea.  Oh yes, there's the hint system. The pathetic hint system - which is a puzzle itself trying to figure what the hand-drawn sketch mean exactly is more frustrating than rewarding. And it's timed. You'll find yourself clicking the hint button numerous times, just to get a long enough view of what the picture is supposed to represent.  Such a promising notion - a game with gorgeous visuals and abysmal logic design. As a fan of Monkey Island, Torrin's Passage, King's Quest, Grim Fandango, Toonstruck, Day of the Tentacle, etc, Violett simply sucks.  The major basic reason Violett fails as a game, is that you puzzles are neither interesting or rewarding. You just want to see get them over with to 'see' more of the game.  I couldn't finish the game. Sadly, this game has multiple bugs. I came to a part called 'Clock Tree' or 'Tree Clock', I can't remember. But the game broke. Violett is supposed to get 3 corks from a black ant. But the ant and cork have disappeared from the game. Numerous people have reported this same glitch, and supposedly a game patch came out before I purchased the game to fix this. Well, it's still broken. And since the game uses auto-save, apparently the only fix for me to restart the game. Well, that's not going to happen. I hope this review helps you avoid this broken game. ",

The games storyline is rather confusing and the puzzles do not make sense at all, I had to use a walkthrough to play this game and yet I still couldn't figure out why I had to 'do this to get that' because it didn't even make sense..  Buying this game, I feel rather regretful but I believe there's been new updates so my review should not be that accurate, I suggest buying this when it's on sale like maybe a 75% sale or something.",

Illustrations are nice but im just not a fan of 3D modelling artworks so didn't really enjoy it very much. But the lack of storyline and point to this game just really turned me off. The controls of the game is weird cause violett can use her telepathic skills on some objects but not others when its just next to it. The puzzles do not make sense, so i was just guessing everything, touching every object to see if it works or not. i just dont like puzzle games that dont make sense.   oh and also, violett's 'AHH' sound is just annoying, she makes that sound whenever you touch an object that you cant interact with.   Overall, the theme of entering a magical world with magical creatures is interesting, but the controls, weird puzzles and lack of storyline killed it for me.",
