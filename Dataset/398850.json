            "review_text": "Really, really great. It's a typing game in terms of its game mechanics, but really it has much more in common with games like Bastion. The game is a little buggy in places, but nothing game-breaking. And the gameplay is really, really fun. The story is a tad cheesy, but decent. And the voice acting is actually pretty decent, which is much more than can be said for many indie games.  But the gameplay is where this game really shines. Intuitive, addictive, and fun. I'm REALLY enjoying exploring the world.  And, bonus, it's kid-friendly, but not childish. And it looks really great.  Highly reccomend.",

            "review_text": "I bought this blindly to test out a new keyboard, so you can imagine my surprise when a 'typing game' actually turns out to be an expansive RPG with a challenging and complex battle system and a touching story. In fact, the typing-game-connotations aren't doing this game any favors, since it has more in common with Bastion, Okami or Darksiders - it has a gradually expanding overworld, themed dungeons, elemental powerups that also act as gating abilities to access certain areas, secrets and collectibles, side activities like monster-nest removal, etc. The combat tests more than just your typing skills, asking you to switch between elements on the fly (by actually typing the element's name) and using the right elements on the right targets (by judging their size, the complexity of their words, and the speed they're approaching you) in the right order. It makes for some pretty nail-biting encounters, and more than a few deaths.  I was pleasantly surprised with how the story integrates into the gameplay. The game has no cinematics, and never leaves the isometric perspective, so storytelling falls to the voice-over narration and, more importantly, the level design. The girl-riding-a-fox-and-fighting-insects fantasy plot allegorically tells the biography of a woman, and every dungeon depicts a pivotal moment in her life. E.g., the 'water temple' is a puzzle-filled greek ruin under constant threat of a flood, mirroring the woman's stressful college years. This is conveyed through visual design, subtle narration (occasionally in another voice, which always signifies the woman in question speaking outside of the fantasy plot), details like the enemies having academic terms as their 'health bars,' and that dungeon's collectibles, which together make a picture of a graduation ceremony. It's a really nice way to freshen up the classical Ocarina-of-Time level progression.",

            "review_text": "This is a gorgeous and amazing game! The animation is so creative and beautiful to look at. I also really love typing games and it is nice to see something that seems made for teens and adults to enjoy. The music is also pretty good, although it fades out a bit too much and the environmental effects become aggravating after a while. I would not recommend it for typing practice, unless you are pretty good and just want to practice speed. It probably also helps if you have a decent vocabulary. Sometimes the words get blurry and since it is better to hit them far off, knowing the word from the few letters you can see and the length helps you type it out and other times they are just very long words and being able to spell them out quickly then jump to others is a great help.  I only have two criticisms. The ice dungeon is frustrating, because for whatever reason the arrow keys don't aim well, but all the targets are very sensitive. Also, if you don't have the proper screen size the words relatively near the edge of the screen can be very hard to read, meaning that you're sometimes stuck typing at the last minute. This also is not really a criticism but I think I will have to play it again to really understand the story. It is not that complex and I think I get it, but there's a small plot hole I do not really understand. Also, the end credits song is not included in the purchaseable soundtrack for whatever reason.  It works just fine on the mac. I have a MacBook Pro 2012 and the colors looked great, framerate was good, and movement was just fine.  It is not a very long game, but it is a lot of fun. It is fun to explore and the attacks are really interesting. The idea of watching a world made out of paper folded out for you to see is wonderful.  I would recommend this for people who like typing and exploration games.",

            "review_text": "Usually, when i hear about a typing game, i'm all 'meh' about it because most of the time, there's nothing else valuable in the game than the fact that you have to type words.  Epistory is not 'meh' at all. It's really pretty and you can just walk around, appreciating the environment, listening the soft music, and just relaxing. And then comes gameplay, which can be pretty intense ! I love the fact that the game can adjust difficulty based on your keyboard mastery. For years i was trying to write without looking at my keyboard, but never found any motivation to do so. This game gave me this motivation, and will help me accomplish it, along with a significant improvement of my typing speed.  Story is nice so far, there is definitely something to learn about this world, and behind the narrator.  Another very important point : I couldn't notice any bug right now. The game runs smoothly and everything seems to work as it should. In a time where we see a lot of half-finished games sold as release versions, i think this is worth mentioning.  So, even if you don't enjoy typing games, i think this one is worth it. And if you're looking for a game to help you with your typing skill, that's even better.  P.S. Devs, thank you SO MUCH for making this game a MULTI5, and thinking about every keyboard configruation that goes with it. Just for that, i love you.",

I didn't pay much attention to the vague story, but the addicting typing battle system and the paper craft visuals kept me playing the whole afternoon until I beat it 5 hours later. When the game is finished, there is also an arena mode which gives you a leaderboard driven typing survival challenge.  It is well-worth 15 dollars if you're a fan of Typing of the Dead, looking for something mechanically straight-forward, very pretty, and aren't looking for someone to teach you how to type.",

As simple as that... initially. But once there's 20 enemies coming at you in rapid succession, that's when it gets a little more tricky, mainly when the words ramp up in difficulty as well. And to make it somewhat more difficult, you have four different spells which you need to type the word of - spark, fire, ice and wind - in order to activate them. Certain spells for certain enemies every now and then.  Furthermore, the graphics are gorgeous. Whenever you reveal a new part of the land, it looks like as if it's made out of pages from a book. In fact, everything in this game looks like that and I loved it, it's like origami. The soundtrack is relaxing and fits the game perfectly, the narrator has got the perfect (smooth) voice for the story and yeah... it's awesome.  Finally, the story... and how fun is it as a whole? The story revolves around this girl who's riding on a three-tailed fox and it follows the writing process of a writer, who's trying to complete her story. The narration is the writers thoughts as it all unfolds in front of you. And yeah, it's really freaking fun, at least if you like to type and you like adventures games.  If you find it on a sale, there's no doubt that you need to buy it. Otherwise, follow my advice (see above).",

While it may not be the most original game and it may not have the world's most amazing writing/story, the core gameplay mechanics and the visuals make this an easy game to recommend.  Of my entire steam library, this is one of the only games that has motivated me to write a review.

But not a very satisfying story.  ---  (typing review slowly, cause ow my hands are exhausted) I'm loving this game, but omg is it hard sometimes. (biggest word I've hit was: pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis) This is a pure typing game, even the controls are a bit awkward, until you learn that you can use WASD or the arrow keys to move around.  The gameplay itself is mostly you standing in a single spot and typing the words that appear next to an enemy to attack them. There are 4 elements that have different effects on the enemy, and some enemies are only hurt by a single element. This makes for a nice strategic gameplay style. The words chosen can get really long, if they want to throw a curve at you, but are all real words.  The story is... lacking. It's mostly following a young girl that I think is trying to find out where she belongs in the world. It's told in a nice storybook way, with narration, but I'm not really sure where it's all leading.  The art style is really nice, and the animations are amazing. It looks great when you unlock more land, as the pages fill in the space. Really amazing art direction.  I haven't really noticed the music, which means it's neither good nor bad.  For achievment hunters, this one is going to be a bit tough. Some of the achievements require typing at a certain speed or with extreme accuracy.  Overall, really nice game.",

There are some minor gameplay issues, mostly to do with knocking enemies so far back that their target words disappear, but on the whole the strategic facets of combat and the absolutely absurd vocabulary more than make up for them. If you're looking for a typing game that aspires to be more than simply 'type the words on the screen,' this is it. I heartily recommend Epistory for the elemental combat mechanics, and for trying to reinvent a genre that never really tried to be more than pressing buttons.  The only real negative is the story - what little there is of it. The plot is lazy and angsty, mostly boiling down to 'Oh no, I'm so lost and alone,' and the writer has definitely attended the Academy of Vague. Most every line suggests that the character is trying to do  something , but the continual lack of coherent progress kills the sense of mystery, and after a half hour or so I found myself just wanting our hero to be quiet and let me play. Alone, got it. Lost, got it. Feeling an urge to reach XYZ for no reason, got it. The ending is disappointing and offers little real resolution; unfortunately that puts it entirely on par with what you're offered on your way through the game. Still, typing, right?",

The main appeal of the game is obviously it's art style and rather rare (but not unique) gameplay - you interact with the world by typing in names of things. You need to freeze some water? Type in ICE, to swich to 'Ice Mode', then Frost, to freeze the lake and walk though. Every nearby object has something written over it - freezing the water may require yout to type in Blizzard instead, and so on. I liked the extra touch that this works even in menus, as alterantive control over mouse or moving with keyboard from button to button.  The game is mainly about exploring this dreamlike (*wink*wink*) world on the back of your three tailed fox, as a little girl - trying to find out who you are, where you came from, and what is happening around you. You bring back life to forests, hurt by fire, and I really don't want to say anything else, because the game has so little to offer but it's so wonderful to explore it. Be sure to finish every picture collection you can, there is an unexpected twist at the end, and you'll be happy you collected them - also, the game's only story comes from you, the player, trying to figure out who our little hero is by the small clues the game gives.   Summary : it's really a game for those who are open to minimalistic, artistic games, creative and rather unique gameplay you only find maybe in a couple of games, but you also have an above than average quality bar and look for little, ageless masterpieces rather than poorly executed good ideas. It lasted 4 hours for me (included ~0,5 hours having lunch), explored and collected everything I could aside from a single 'dungeon' I did not know how to access. I went far above max level, unlocked every ability - I recommend you to upgrade exploration (map) and experience/combo related abilities first, so you don't need to backtrack too much later on. There is a survival arena mode in the main menu, if you are interested, but it's recommended only after finishing the game to preserve the atmopshere of the story.

Typing to explore and attack is made all the more wonderful if you've got a high quality keyboard. It's not necessary but I'm rocking a CM Storm and it's incredibly satisfying to type a complicated word quickly, correctly and with the aural feedback of a mechanical keyboard. The downside is that I will be keeping my wife up as I clunk away into the night.  Epistory has made me realize that I'm not nearly as good of a typist as I thought I was. As soon as I'm under pressure from approaching enemies, my typing falls to pieces and I get stuck by words such as 'wee' or 'pew.' I would not survive as a 1960s secretary.  I cannot highly recommend Epistory enough. It's a genuinely fun game with no real downside.",

            "review_text": "When I watched trailers for this game for the first time, I got the impression that the writing would be very literary, very highbrow, and a central part of the game. The trailers certainly try to imply that. In actuality, the writing is not that great, and almost tumblry at times. Although I will concede, that, a lot of it being in the form of disjointed sentences makes it harder to appraise. And also, the writing coming out of the protagonist in such disjointed sentences, one at a time, makes sense in the context of the story. Speaking of which...  The plot twist at the end of the game has got to be the oldest cliché in the, ahem, book. So much so, that people are reluctant to use it nowadays, which is a good thing. So when I saw the ending of Epistory, I literally did a mental triple take:    ...Really? They actually went with it, the absolute madmen? Are you serious? No, but like... really?   Ultimately, it doesn't make the game less satisfying, but I found it disapointing. A bit. The way the initial chapters play out, I was imagining the story is about a young novelist struggling with writer's block, trying to regain her inspiration or maybe a more literal search for a missing muse. But no.  Luckily, the gameplay is solid. The adaptive difficulty does a good job of picking a difficulty level for you, or you can manually choose out of like... five, I think. The graphics are gorgeous; the origami world 'unfolding before your eyes' gimmick doesn't really get old. The audio is okay. The puzzles are so simple that at first I found them insulting, but as time went on, I warmed up to this emanation of casualness. There aren't that many typing games out there, so a new entry into the genre and as well-polished as this always makes me pleased. In terms of content it doesn't match up to the likes of The Typing of The Dead, but I don't mind.",

            "review_text": "Zelda teaches typing is the easiest way I can explain this one. If that sounds interesting and you can touch type, this is well worth a look even at full price. If you can't already touch type, it's not going to make any effort to teach you, and certain areas are almost definitely going to be impossbile unless you're *very* fast at hunting and pecking.   Gameplay consists of wondering around the world and typing words to kill or activate stuff. There are four main dungeons that add elemental powers to your typing and four sub-dungeons that offer more challenging and creative uses of the powers. Both dungeon types have fully optional image fragments to collect, which is usually fun enough to be worthwhile. There are also something like 24 Nests between the overworld and dungeons that offer a progressively more difficult rush of enemies coming from all directions. These are the hardest and most enjoyable parts of the game.  Even as someone who loves abstract stories, I found this one too abstract to be enjoyable. I think it got lost in a lot of its own metaphors and made a huge mistake in not revealing the frame until the end. It doesn't detract from the game, but I don't think it added anything.   The soundtrack is basic, but decent enough. Ambient noises are very well done. I had some seemingly arbitrary frame rate dips early on, but otherwise it performs and looks acceptable.   I've only got two real complaints: The electric chaining on the Spark power is unpredictable to the point of being useless, particularly if you want to get the no mistakes for X characters achievements. Second, the game does not check if one enemy's active word is a substring of another active word. This doesn't break the game, but it's very annoying when you start typing, for example, 'barren' only for the game to instead attack the less dangerous enemy with 'bar.' I believe the intended behavior in this instance is to shoot the shorter enemy while maintaining your progress against the other, but I had numerous cases where only the shorter enemy got shot and I had to start typing the longer word from the beginning again.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game because I’m learning BÉPO and I wanted something to practice with. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it through to the end. By far the best thing about this game is the art style and the pleasing paper effects when a new area unravels. It seems the game is somewhat inspired by Zelda-style games with a large map and several dungeons to explore. However I think this comparison sets you up for disappointment because it is lacking several elements which the real Zelda games do much better. The story begins by building up a lot of intrigue but in the end it doesn’t really seem to go anywhere and the random snippets of narration don’t really connect together. Like a Zelda game there are a few puzzle elements but in practice the puzzles are relatively easy and there are only a few different ideas which are repeated. In the dungeons you can find new magic powers and they have done a good job of making these interesting. All of them are useful in different circumstances. It would have been nice if they could have made more use of these powers in the puzzles or made the boss battles require the magic in interesting ways like when you gain a new item in Zelda. Sadly there aren’t really any bosses in Epistory and there are only a handful of different enemy types which are repeated over and over in different combinations.  I found the game relatively easy despite my typing speed still being a pitiful 20WPM. I wonder if this could be because the automatic difficulty adjustment recognised my terrible typing speed but didn’t manage to adjust as I improved. The first few nests were extremely difficult but for most of the later ones I was able to beat them on my first attempt.  Regardless of the criticism in my review I still highly recommend the game mostly because the innovative typing mechanic is such a joy to play. I hope one day they will be able to work on the idea and make an even cooler sequel.",

            "review_text": "Pros:  -Art is gorgeous, and together with the soundtrack, it provides a relaxing experience -Puzzle elements (although they are relatively easy) -Encourages exploration -Each dungeon is unique from each other -Each of the 4 elements (water, fire, wind, spark) have their advantages and disadvantages. The player can also switch the elements at any point. -Unique way to tell the story -The difficulty scales (with adaptive difficulty turned on) -Arena mode enables the player to have more practice on their typing skills  Cons:  -Sometimes the words can be blocked by the environment. For example, when playing in the labriynth arena, the words can be blocked by the trees. I feel that for a typing game, the words should always be visible, since reaction time is critical. -When clearing the corrupted nests, the narration should be paused, as the player would be too focused on the enemies to pay any attention to the story. -With that said, the story is meh. Can be improved. -Rather short (I finished it in 13 hours because I was grinding for all the achievements - the story can be completed in as little as 5 hours)  Verdict: 8/10  Conclusion:   Its mechanics and art are amazing and you don't even have to be good at typing to enjoy this game. The relaxing experience would be a good break from other hardcore games.",
