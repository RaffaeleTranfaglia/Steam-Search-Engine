            "review_text": "A hard playing absolutly fun little game. It is kind of a mashup of spyhunter, Carmageddon, and any road trip movie. Mix in a heavy dose of Fear and Lothing in Las Vesgas with rude crude humor, and you have a recipe for a good time. Easy to grasp controls mated with simple and intuitve menus quickly turn the family seadan the into a rolling mosh pit of death.  Plenty of power ups to fuel the mayhem can be had at the many roadside stops, along with various hicthhikers to fill your car with violence needed to get that mega-metal concert at roads end. Purchace items from baseball bats to flame throwers to golden concet tickets to help you to arrive on time, in style, and mostly intact.  Did I metion the humor? The game pokes fun at most everything, never has dying in a flaming car been so funny, and die you will lots. The roads many nutball factions are built to grind you to dust, and the bosses will just stop your butt into the pavement. There are no saves only continues, so there is no way to aviod your nasty un-timely demise, but you can just start again and again, wich you will due to the addicing nature of the game.  Game upsides  1. Nice to look at art work with a full range of painful gory ways to die.  2. Many ways to build up your crew with a large list of weapons and drug to boost your stats. Dont forget the quickly boost stat over the barrel of a pistiol provided you survive the encounter.  3. Lot of new buddies to share the road with you from all walks of life. Your gonna need them because the road is kinda rough and a new replacement freind is a good thing to have when bad things happen.  4. Solid gameplay that take ten to thirty minutes to play. Do note I did not say complete.  Game downsides.  1. Not a game for whiny whimps who want lots of saves.  2. Absoluty NOT for small kids to play language is harsh, and drug and booze abound.   For the money you will be forking over this game is a bargin with tons of replayabily go get it now.",

            "review_text": "I wouldn't recommend this game. - barely.  I think calling something rogue-like is a bit of a cop out when it comes to occasionally extreemely imbalanced difficulty. You can't really expect to get too far in this game at any given time. Sometimes things will go really smoothly and at others you will get crushed and will wonder exactly what you did wrong. Sometimes it's nothing, sometimes it's your fault. Most of the time it's difficult to really tell.  Occasionally the enemies will just sit there and let you soot them with ranged weapons while they sit out of range of their own flame throwers. ?!?!   Occasionally you will go from shop to shop and never get a relevant powe-up, though you desperately need them to have a chance. ?!?!  So it's really hard to say if someone will like it. I enjoy it well enough, but it can be frustrating even if you like it. Maddening if it's not your cup of tea. Many situations will probably be unwinnable and rogue like games use the term as a cop out for actual gameplay balance.  I will say that the art style is a lot of fun. It's absurd.",

At first it seemed punishing with a cheesy grating sense of humor, but I was hooked by the time I did my first sucessful run. The vehicle unlocks add a lot to the gameplay; you want to try a new run with each new vehicle just to see how it changes the way you play the game. I also appreciate the details, like how the Mad Max caricature is the only enemy to drive on the right...Honestly, I'm writing this review in the vain hope that my thumbs up will help get this game established in a wiki so I can overanalyze my choices with other obsessive fans :p",

            "review_text": "I like everything about this game...except the gameplay. It's got a Mad Max-ish aesthetic coupled with filthy humor, which I like, great graphics and an awesome punk and rock soundtrack. Cars exploding, blood and guts flying and music pumping, what's not to like?  Like I said, the gameplay! There is no flow to it at all. It starts, stops, starts, stops, starts and then stops. This game is a simplistic car combat game where the goal is to destroy one car, most of the time, and then pick your next destination by picking a highway sign. Go straight ahead to attack a neo-nazi convoy or turn right to chase down a car full of Westboro Baptist nutjobs. With each choice, there's also a bonus destination you visit before you go to the next stretch of road. It can be an event that gives you a random car, a place where you can mutate your characters or a place to upgrade your weapons. Those are rare, though, and 99% of the time, the bonus destination is a shop.  The shop is just a menu where you click on things to buy them. You can sell, but you don't really have an inventory (only what your characters can carry, which is one active and one passive item). You can upgrade your car and the characters in them, replace the characters if you find a better one, buy more weapons and find special items. These things are all great. The problem is that you also have to visit the shop, you have no choice in the matter, because you must find and buy 'tickets' that allow you to actually win if you survive the game. These tickets are completely random. In the session I just had, there had only been a single ticket for sale when I died about 70% to the goal. I needed four. Because apparently surviving wasn't difficult enough, which it is, winning has to be totally up to random chance over whether or not you find these tickets. Because that's fun.  Not only do you have to keep visiting the shop in search of tickets, you also have to find 'jobs' for your characters. That's how you make money. There are a bunch of useless ones like 'here's $50 (a miniscule amount) for managing to destroy a car without killing any of its passengers (which is hard)', and then there are the good ones like $100 for destroying a car (which is what you do on every single level, so it's $100 guaranteed unless you die) or $75 for beating a level. I think you can guess which ones are in every single shop and which ones are rare, forcing you to visit every shop you can to find them and maximize your income which in turn maximizes your killing potential through buying upgrades.  And there's the problem. You drive for 30 seconds, destroy a car, then you spend a minute looking through the menu. Drive for 20 seconds, menu for 15 seconds, drive for 10, menu for 40, drive for 20, menu for 120... See where I'm going? There's no flow! You can't just choose to have fun and destroy cars, you have to sit around and stare at a menu half the time. The only way to have uninterrupted fun with this game is if you have the enormous luck to score four good jobs and four tickets in your first four shop visits. Then, maybe, you could actually focus on driving and shooting and smashing and having fun.   As it stands, this is half an awesome and hilarious game and half a boring menu-clicking simulator. I've only played about an hour and a half, but I can't see myself going back to it.",

            "review_text": "Big fan of the game and been enjoying it thoroughly so far, but the one things I'd say is the boss enemies seem a bit uneven. In particular the sawblade groupie and the alien one. It feels like the car is always in harms way due to its size. Maybe they have really easy solutions that I haven't figured out yet, but it's always been a 'game over' situation when going up against those two, even with a decently upgraded car and passangers.  Despite that, the game is an utter blast. There's a real solid feel to all of the action and upgrading you can do and the unlockable cars add a really fun sense of replayability with each one requiring different tactics to use well. Saying that though, even the standard car can do the same. Particularly fond of going for a melee based right side with a spare gunner.  Tough game, but a lot of fun.",

            "review_text": "Death Skid Marks is an extremely challenging, but immensely fun, car based action rpg governed by a high degree of randomization mixed with an attractive and detailed retro graphic style full of extreme violence, language and dark humor. No two games will play out the same. Multiple weapons, jobs, enemy types and hard-as-s.h.i.t bosses with permadeath to really make you plan your moves out. New crew members to recruit and can upgrade their stats with drugs or dropped off to a mad scientist for experimentation. New rides, drugs, weapons and modes to unlock as you take down bosses and if you manage to make it to the concert.  You will die often but the game is meant to be replayed over and over again so dust yourself off and hit the road again :)  Surprising moment: Putting a crew member's life on the line via Russian Roulette to get 50% stat increase across ALL categories!! ;).  Highlight: Had an alien riding shotgun while FIRING a shotgun at an enemy car.... sheer brilliance in the surreality of that scenario. ;)  Didnt-see-that-coming moment: Parody guest appearances by famous movie and cartoon characters like Scooby-doo and The Terminator!   Sad moment: Losing a crew that you have gotten attached to that rode with you until the bitter(and violent) end. Hey at least we went down fighting :P   Edit: Scored lowered to a more realistic level especially after finding out that the game requires the player to be online AT ALL TIMES.  Great game just be warned about this potential annoyance.  I understand the need to protect their intellectual property but pirates always find a way to circumvent such protections and this game is no different so please do not indirectly punish legitimate customers as this would be the perfect 'on the go' game.  Thumbs up to the developers for their timely response and amendment to the store page disclosing this valuable information. :)  Now what are you waiting for? GO BUY THIS GAME AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS  8.75/10",

You're Mark Skid and your goal is to get to a concert. On your way you'll pick up hitchhikers, gear them up with weapons, upgrade your car and kill absolutely everything and everyone that gets in your way.  You can unlock a lot of different cars, each being different than the other. Some give passive bonuses/penalties, some are equipped with saws or even with a freaking rocket launcher.  You can equip your hitchhikers with melee or ranged weapons which you can buy in shops. In those shops you can also buy food to heal your characters, upgrades to your car, drugs to boost stats of your characters, repair your vehicle, all kinds of special items and of course tickets to the concert!  There are also all kind of mini-games that you can enter during your trip. There's a russian roulette mini-game where if your selected character loses he dies but if he wins his stats get boosted greatly. There's also a slot machine if you feel like gambling, workshop where you can upgrade your weapons and other stuff.  There's a decent number of bosses that you can encounter and they get randomly selected for each run. In each run you will face a total of 5 bosses, including the final one but they'll always be different (even final bosses change each time). They all of course have their own attacks and patterns that you'll have to learn if you want to beat them.  The game is pretty challenging but fun and addictive. The RNG can help or screw you over at times like in any game from this genre and I have to admit that when I started playing I thought it's unfair and impossible to win. But as I continued to play I realized that's not the case. Once you get skilled enough at the game and know how everything works you can win almost every run.",
