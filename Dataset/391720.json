The constant 'something scary is gonna happen but you don't know when and then suddenly a scream' thing is getting real old real fast, and even when they try to add atmosphere and a cryptic story it just seems like they're trying too hard.  Layers of Fear doesn't do that though. In fact, it plays off that. This is one of the few games I've played where I don't get scared out of shock, I get scared because I genuinely don't know what is coming up. It seems to know the exact moment when players expect to be scared, and then they let nothing happen, and wait until you're at you're most vulnerable state before punishing you for thinking you knew what was coming.  This is how horror should be done.",

PROS:  + flawless sound design + the game will keep on surprising you using the environments to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you + the constant dread and discomfort- you can't 'get used to' the permanent fear + heavy story themes + the more notes/family mementos you find, the more your understanding of the plot changes  CONS:  - if you don't like FPP horror walking simulators, this title will render your psyche scarred for life - arguably, a bit short(I can't imagine braving the terror any longer myself)  Layers of Fear is a horror gaming genre masterpiece. The disturbing synergy of sounds, music, visuals and unpredictable jump scares ultimately presents you with an unforgettable and traumatizing gaming experience. The most surprising element of LoF is the story and its depth. I won't spoil anything- let's just say that things aren't what they seem at the first glance. If you dig deep enough, you will uncover deeper layers shedding a bit more light on the protagonist's past. If you're okay with panic attacks and your heart skipping a beat or ten a hundred times over. I normally avoid horror titles, for obvious reasons, but this one..damn.  'FIRST STEP IS THE HARDEST.'",

            "review_text": "A must play with headphones because of the amazing sound design that is implemented in surround sound headphones and even the developers recommend it when you open up the game. The first 30 minutes of the game were very scary and I legit thought it was the scariest game I ever played. I was playing on full volume and when the first scares started happening I was jumping constantly because I didn’t know what I was getting myself into and they felt unpredictable. However the game started being less scary the more I played because that shock factor had gone. There are jumpscares every single minute to the point where I became immune to them. The game then ended up being just a barrage of loud noises coming from your headphones which is such a shame because the creativity, scary imagery and atmosphere is all there but it wasn’t paced well at all because it was happening constantly. If they made the game twice the length and put the scares once every say 3-5 minutes that scare factor that I was experiencing at the start would have went on the entire time but because it was happening constantly without a rest I couldn’t feel anything from them. The fact that there are no stakes and you can't die doesn't help the game either. It’s such a shame because the level of creativity and imagination in this game is amazing it’s just the pacing of the scares that hold it back. I can still easily recommend it because of the creativity and scary imagery alone and I am glad that I experienced the game.  7/10 (Good)",

            "review_text": "Absolutely loved this game. Did not think I would be so into it. The atmosphere and sound are top notch. playing in a dark room in the middle of the night, especially on a stormy one, you will have chills down your spine just from the sounds.   Without spoiling anything the story is weird but it fits the bill, if one would like you can take its meaning a little deeper. I think the developers left alot to the imagination on purpose because it adds your own personal level of terror to the situation.   The scares are of a psychological nature, ones that are jumpy fade in and out, you never really get a chance to get used to them or tire of them which makes playing through the entire game easy without dragging it out. Game length is perfect for the situation.   Game ran great in ultra on a AMD FX 8580 and an nvidia gtz 780. little choppy at parts and some frame lagging but otherwise perfect,   Cant wait to see what else these developers have in store for us. I'm not too keen on walking simulators but this one definitely has the ability to change my tone. give it a shot!",

            "review_text": "'Layers of Fear' is a pretty unique horror game with a very strong focus on lore and lore-exploration. You'll play an unnamed painter who's struggeling to finish his final painting...  Doesn't sound that scary, right? Well, as you can imagine, the games story gets deeper that that - You'll have to collect certain mementos (which I cannot name due to them being spoilers) to finish named painting... I can tell you, that those aren't your typical souvenirs but way more sinister objects... During your search for those you'll stumble upon more objects to pick up and collect which will involve you more with the games (by the way very well made) lore! You'll slowly uncover the secrets and make connections - eventually comming to a uncanny conclusion! The explorartion and search for those items, along with mutliple endings are a good reason to play through 'Layers of Fear' multiple times, the game is variable and there will most certainly be new paths to discover upon making different (walking-) choices... The only negative aspect I found here is, that you will not take that long to play through the game (only up to 6 hours on my first playthrough, and those due to me playing really slow and careful)... The games graphics are fairly beautiful - even at lower settings! And to me it preformed quite well, despite having a pretty old graphics card! The soundtrack stresses the atmosphere REALLY well!  Now for the horror-aspects: Aside of the games brilliant and unsetteling story, the overall horror setting is well-implemented! The atmosphere on my first playthrough was so thick, strange and tense that it took me long to finish the game, being afraid to stumble into the unnamed horrors of the protagonists past... The mansion is littered with uncanny notes and (mostly!) paintings, and there ARE enemies that will haunt you at times, resulting in sudden jumpscares if you're not careful... This creates a constant feel of dread, especially on the first playthrough, making Layers of Fear a genuinely good horror game with a strong touch of 'mystery'...  tl;dnr?: Layers of Fear is a good horror/mystery-game with multiple endings, but it's very short if you're not frightend easily it might get repetetive if you intend to get all the archievements!",

            "review_text": "Layers of Fear is one of those games that wants to tell you a story, but scare you in the process. Although many would probably dismiss the game for being simply a walking simulator with the occasional jump scare I think that is a disservice to what the game is trying to accomplish.  What makes this game work is the atmosphere and the story, but if you are looking for a fully interactive experience then you will probably be very disappointed. The game centers around exploring a run down Victorian-era mansion while you search for items that will help a painter complete his magnum opus. While you do this you will come across items that help explain who or what has driven him mad and what is tormenting him. While what is 'scary' can be very subjective, I found that even when I expected certain things to happen that it still got me most of the time.  I would say if you enjoy a good scary story with an ending that can change depending on your actions then Layers of Fear would be a good fit. If you are on the fence, but still intrigued by the premise of the game perhaps wait for a Steam sale and give it a go.",

It is more a 'journey within' that carries many elements of horror than a game centered on horror itself; that is to say that the focus lies within the story. Those who wish to scavange every nook and cranny will find the answers as to why things are, while those that simply wander through the maze that is this game can still enjoy the atmosphere.

It's a shame because the graphics are very nice and so are the audio, they also pull some amazing trippy warping of reality, that are genuinely very well done and I honestly did save quite a few screenshots. But graphics wont save you, if the story is lacklustre and scares are poor and too far in between. Furthermore the way that the route through the house is established, it completely destroys the sense of discovery and instead feels like a on-rails ride, that you are unable to divert too far from. The game is also kinda short, only lasting 3-4 hours to completion.  TL;DR If you like horror games and enjoy some nice graphics, buy it,  but only when it's on sale, otherwise give it a miss.  ",

The R9 390 is more powerfu than the GTX 970 and in some games it's on par with the GTX 980 when OC'd so there's really no excuse imo...  To the dev team: do you plan on optimizing the game at all for the new R9 radeon card drivers? I really love this game but the choppy FPS in certain parts of the game (about 30-40% of the time) really ruins the experience..and I didn't want to have to upgrade to the GTX 980Ti to have a fun time playing this just yet. Aside from that, AMAZING game. Plays stellar, great visuals, surprisingly amazing video game especially considering it's based on the Unity platform but maybe this game is just a brilliant example of what the Unity engine is capable of, gripping gameplay and just a masterful artpiece.  9.6/10",

            "review_text": "I want to start this off by saying that if psychological horror is your thing then you might like this game.  Something about psychological horror compared to other types of horror stands out to me the most. They tell you 'it's all in your head' but your reality is warped into a hellish nightmare that only you can see and feel. You're trapped in your head and everything is real to you. So real that you experience both emotional and physical pain from the things your mind has concocted. Layers of Fear is literally all of that. Your decent into madness is frightening but as you go through the game you feel compelled to push forward and gain what you can from this experience. To piece together your life that seems to have slipped between the cracks of your memories. To see what started it all.  There are three endings that you can unlock and every little thing you do to get them matters. The art and soundtrack are astounding. Even if you don't have a taste for the arts you can't help but appreciate the beauty of it all. And the attention to detail is wonderful to me. As you piece together little things about your past you start to see things that aren't mentioned in the main story. In the end, you start to wonder whether your sanity was in a state of question because of your marriage or if you'd been experiencing this sort of hell prior to it all.  The only con I can think of (at the moment at least) is that everything is quite linear. I consider it a con only if you're looking for something other than a 'walkthrough' through the game. You can't fight nor can you hide but that doesn't mean you don't have any sort of interaction. You do but not in a way some would probably hope for. I'm honestly okay with this as it works with the story but not everyone might be into this. I'm okay with it only because in actuality, if you start to lose your sense of self there is nothing you can hide from. This is your twisted mind. You go where it wants you to go and experience what it wishes you to experience and I think that was Bloober Team's intention. This is the experience they were trying to go for because this is the truth. This is something that happens.  As for the DLC, I feel like it's a hit or miss. You either like it or you don't. In Inhertiance you take on the role of the daughter and, again, you have three endings to unlock. Each ending is a different type of 'inheritance' that you receive. The gameplay is very much like the main game in the sense that the little things you do will ultimately lead you to a good, neutral or bad ending. But there are two differences between the DLC and the main game. One is that it isn't nearly as interactive as the other and two, your memories are quite skewed. As you grow older you begin to forget the things that you experienced as a child. Whether it be trauma or a good time - everything becomes either nonexistent or blurred in your mind. This is, to me, a major point to the plot and depending on which of the three paths you decide to take you begin to shape out something that may or may not be truth.  In the end, if you're looking for a horror game with an immersive story then this might be for you. I personally love it and I do recommend it to those who aren't partial to a ideal/non-ideal conclusion. Whatever sort of conclusion you may or may not hope for.",

            "review_text": "Layers of Fear is a  definite  psychological horror game with always-climbing fear and suspense that puts you in the place of an artist, who bears some mental disorder (schizophrenia?) and returns home to finish his masterpiece.  As you walk about your huge mansion, you will begin to notice very horrific changes in both the environment, scenary, and of course, the paintings themselves as you uncover the dark secret behind this artist's past and his deranged mind.   At every corner, there are jumpscares, 'should-I-go-in-there-or-not' moments, as well as persistent and ever-increasing states of fear that continue to form as you progress through both the storyline of the game and the game itself.  The game is pretty short: only 6 Chapters, but many things happen in each chapter, making the game rich of fear, yet full of anxiety and excitement to endure:D.  For the sake of achievements, there are mementos and family items that one can find in this game, further immersing oneself in the background of this mad artist, while also understanding what happened to him and his family.  Graphics are truly amazing in this game, so well established and detailed that my eyes become dragged to the screen everytime I see paint, or a chair, or pretty much anything in this game. No joke, one can observe the texture of the paintings themselves as if one was right where the artist is, and one can see the detail of the walls, plants, windows, and surrounding environment (walls, floor, furniture, etc.) [Kudos to the devs that made such an excellent game].  The music on both the starting of the game and in the game is very harmonic, in fact, brings scary ambience to the game and its own environment.  In addition, one can choose to continue along the story path or the optional route, bringing an the artist into deeper, scarier parts of his mansion to uncover either more mementos or darker secrets, providing this game with interesting opportunities as well as becoming immune to a 'path-driven' game with a dull one-route guide.  I have not much to say about this game, but will say this:  Snowy's Scorey:   10: Masterpiece, highly recommended to play   9: Truly brilliant, recommended at its best 8: Excellent, recommended 7: Awesome, recommended, but with certain limitations 6: Decent, may or may not recommend 5: Meh, some things right, some things wrong 4. Err..., not sure if this game is up for grabs 3. Not worth looking out 2. Not worth buying 1. Quarantine yourself from this game  This game is like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. One can follow his/her own path and choose whether to go along the story path or optional route, which is exactly what Layers of Fear brings. For a short game, was extremely well made, graphics are amazing, music is definitely scary, but beautiful, story can be slow, but gets faster with game progression, cool mementos and quotes to hear from the artist, and of course, all these paintings that get deformed before your very eyes are  all real paintings  (no joke!).  Is this game worth the money? Heck yes!",

Beautifully done graphics, backdrops and rooms are small masterpieces. The only complaint I might have is that the developers used some art assets again and again. While things may look different medals, books and papers etc. all just are copied into place. While it doesn't detract from the game in a terrible way, it seemed a bit lazy after they had gone to so mucxh effort otherwise. Really wanted to give this a nine out of ten graphics wise but... 8/10 due to the asset copy and paste.

The execution of every part of the game is great, meaning the seamless exploration that at times seems to be neverending. The story, albeit simple, has many leads and references around the world in which the game takes place. Reasonable replay value there.  One thing I dislike about Layers of Fear, is how the only elements to thrill the player are jump scares. I can appreciate a good story and a good atmosphere, but I do think the team could have done a lot better by coming up with some mature, well-spun horror instead of childish scares. It's sad to see such a good effort on the development side go to waste on simple shock effects.  I recommend this to players who like to immerse themselves and experience a solid, albeit shallow, horror story.  Feedback with potential spoilers below:   (1)I think letting the protagonist rely more upon the world to start with will make the its chaotic state more striking later on. (2)With so good writing, its sad that the player doesn't get to identify with the protagonist more. I think you could induce a sense of loss and helplessness if the good lives of the artists were depicted earlier on in the game. (3)The sudden changes to parts of the room briefly lost from view is excellent. If it was used less frequently, perhaps players wouldn't grow to expect it in the late parts of the game.  ",

Layers of Fear is basically a 'walking simulator'. -The ending is a little unsatisfying in my opinion. -Some 'puzzles' leave you wandering around and around. -Some parts are direct rip-offs from PT Silent Hill. -One playthrough is only 3 hours.  The early access was amazing but sadly I had high hopes for the full game. Too high.  With that said, it's still a great game. Layers of Fear is a psychological horror of stunning visuals, sounds, setting and scares. What it lacks of is the gameplay; there's almost none of it and what we get is just straight out annoying 'puzzles'. Nevertheless, still worth buying and playing if you're up for a scare. 7.5/10.",

In a market completely inundated with half-♥♥♥♥♥ survival horror titles, Layers of Fear is a gorgeous, shining example of how it should be done.  The game unfolds like a haunted house. Navigate the mansion as it changes around you. Even as you look away, doors disappear, phones fall up stairs, paintings change. It's ... crazy. Casual puzzles (find the combination, find the key) keep the action interesting as the threat of tastefully-placed jump scares heighten the tension. The attention to detail in this game is very impressive. Every corner of the game is inhabited by props and hidden goodies abound. Completionists have their work cut out for them.  While Layers of Fear does indeed rely on jump scares to keep players on their toes, they are not overdone and are always appropriate.  The game takes place over six chapters, each more disturbing and gruesome than the last. By the end of the first chapter, I thought 'this isn't that scary.' But by the end of chapter six I was having dreams about this game. And they weren't of gumdrops and junk.  I finished Layers in about 4 hours, which I felt was well spent. The ending was subtle, but not anticlimactic. It was pretty good and it left me wanting more.  Despite the really top-notch graphics, my little laptop managed to run this just fine. Framerates weren't the best, but they weren't bad enough to spoil the experience.  I've been waiting a long time for this game to get cheap or go on sale. I paid 10$ or so during the Steam summer sale. Very much worth it. Now where's some DLC? I've got my wallet out alreadyd. ",

            "review_text": "Layers of Fear came as a surprise to me. I never heard of this game before when I found it, searching through the 'horror' tags on Steam. The idea to combine psychological horror, the struggle of an artist with the disturbed mind of an alcoholic did sound intriguing.  The game is an easy going walking simulator with just a couple of puzzles. Your overall action is to walk and open doors and drawers. Though at the beginning the game claims 'with your action you tell the story', this is way too much promise! The game has three endings, but it's not really visible how you change them at all. While playing you just realize you can chose between paths sometimes. After reading a bit in the walkthrough, there seem to be crucial actions that you have do to trigger a certain ending. None of them were obvious to me. In the end, I'm fine with my outcome (the neutral ending), but I wouldn't try another run, because I don't want to use a walkthrough or fail with guessing.  What Layers of Fear does in an amazing way is visual storytelling! First I thought it's a mere 'Gone Home' clone, but the house soon turns out to be non-linear and shaping in the most amazing ways. The house becomes you, your character's psychological state of mind. The longer you play, the crazier the rooms get and really display the horror of the protagonist.  Something the story completely fails to do! I really missed a deeper relationship between the artist and his wife. The so-called psychology in this horror was mostly weeping wife and cliched crying baby in the background. 'Wife becomes annoying for the artist, because she got ugly.' Two books about marriage problems in the game and a lot of emptied wine bottles are not enough, at least for my taste and what could have been possible with all the assets. Just a couple more letters or a diary would have been amazing...With this subject and two story writers I really hoped for more than the typical annoyed husband that gets vicious over time.   What I also deeply missed in this horror game—the actual horror. Apart from a couple of jump scares you never feel thrilled at all. You simply can't die! Horror to me comes a) with fear of the unknown (totally visible puppets and characters won't do) and the possibility to die, because you are powerless. Thanks to the level design, lighting, sound and FX this game is so well crafted and thick with atmosphere, that it's a joy to just walk through the corridors excited what they have in mind after the next door.   Great experience, would love to see more like this from the studio!",

            "review_text": "  This game looks astounding and has a lot going for it. It has some well thought out jumpscares, which are usually quite unpredictable. However, the game uses them to such an extent that they become the sole things keeping this game afloat. Unsurprisingly, it all begins to sink pretty fast.    I find it quite amusing that a game that revolves around art became an exhibit of its own. A jumpscare exhibit. A vast one at that. I think this should be made clearer, because some of these Steam reviews severely understate this. So let me make this clear by saying that yes,   this game pretty much only relies on jumpscares to deliver the spooks.   It's not a bad thing, or something to be ashamed of - not at all! But bombarding the player with jumpscares nonstop is not good horror. I didn't really feel any dread or suspense at all, because they hardly gave me any breaks. There's a jumpscare in almost every single room you enter.   You are going to get used to the jumpscares  , it's just a matter of time. Of course some of them are more intense than others, but generally speaking I became numb at around the tenth one. When taking into account that the jumpscare count for this game might very well surpass 100, and that the game is around 2-3 hours long, it shouldn't come as a surprise that I didn't have the greatest of times. Most of them were not cheap, although some of them were just random books flying out from a shelf or something. There were a couple of subtle moments I really liked, but most of the jumpscares are just... loud.  This game does have some very beautiful graphics though. Very immersive! I also didn't have any performance issues or anything of the sort.  The story seemed alright. It's delivered with notes and occasional items with voice acted dialogue, which is not a way of storytelling that I particularly enjoy, since they should only ever be there as optional collectables. I can see some people being very confused with the story, because they're only getting little snippets of it at a time.  So, in short, this pretty looking game starts off solid, but unfortunately numbs down the player with continuous jumpscares with a cooldown time of just a few minutes. It desperately tried to catch me off guard by throwing varying (and sometimes quite unique) jumpscares at my face. It was almost like a jumpscare competition.   'Did you get spooked by this painting that moved behind you when you were looking away? How about these books that exploded out of the shelf next to you? No? Well, damn, because that's all I got for now. Come on over to the next room in a minute and I'll see if I can figure something out.'    But please don't be intimidated or turned off because of this one review. If you're not used to horror and you're not really familiar with the tropes, go straight on and give this game a shot! It more than deserves it. (Besides, a lot of people seemed to really like this game.) Horror connoisseurs should be wary, however. If you prefer atmosphere and tension more than anything, you probably won't find it here. This is no Silent Hill. It's more like one of those free indie horror games, but with an actual budget. And believe it or not, that almost worked.",

The fact is that you could play the chapters of this game in any order, because its just a sequence of events with little inevitability linking them together. There is some great art direction and atmosphere in this game, but it feels squandered because... well... I never really cared where I was in the story...

In case the devs are reading this LOUD NOISES=/=SCARY just because you make someone jump doesn't give the same sense of dread as having good ambient sound design.   Not to mention it was a really big pile of horror tropes from other games stitched together, erratic shifting monster? check. Victorian dolls? check. changing environment? check. and you know I was expecting it to be a little bit more of a complex story, seeing as this is just gone home with ghosts basically, but all I got was a fairly mediocre story of artist gone crazy.

You can find plenty of walkthroughs online so you can get all the collectibles and achievments and the story ends up fairly linear anyway.   There was a lot of neat detail, and the theme of rats reminded me of Coraline by Neil Gaiman. But I have to agree with reviews that say the game misses the mark. It comes so close. And then the ending is kinda 'meh' and you have a lot fo questions that aren't answered. I feel like we only got part of a story and I want to know the entire context. It makes for a big let down I feel. For a game that started out so strong, it sure ends pretty dully.   I feel there was some un explored potential. Are you mad? or is your wife mad? what happened to the kid? the dog? The wheelchair and piano are pretty darm scary.   But honestly I just dont feel like I can recomend the game based on how much of a flop the endong seems to be. You were sooo close! But dropped the ball. There are 3 different endings apparently and you'll have to replay probably to get them all.

If you get this game for maybe 10 dollars, I recommend it but at full price.... no. Overall this game is gorgeous but it lacks game play. Its puzzles are plentiful and the environment constantly changes around you but its....a walking simulator type game. You can't really die. You don't get chased by anything, you just run into them and then you progress further indicating you didn't really die, rather you went through the motions.  The game is too short for 20 dollars is mainly why I don't recommend it. Took me 3.3 hours according to my Steam hour counter to complete the bad ending. It does have a cool and more unique kind of plot to it that I haven't seen before in other horror games. Its a psychological horror game and you are in the mind of a painter trying to make the perfect painting in his eyes. Throughout the game you are collecting materials (sort of) and then putting a painting together using those materials. As you progress further into the game, so does the painting and overtime, you see it form into what he's trying to paint. Alas, you get the bad ending, they tell you the painting sucks. Spoiler Alert. Oops.  So you can't die and the game is a puzzle fest. Yet, even for puzzles, they were rather easy for me. No puzzle had me there for a half hour. It was like maybe 10 minutes max that I was stuck on one puzzle.   This game copies the Penumbra/Amnesia style of game play where you can manually open things like doors or drawers and that's about it. You can't really pick up things and move them around.   This game disappointed me. Once you figure out that you're not really in harms way, you might as well stop caring like I did. I was not scared of the game anymore and I just went through the rest of the journey until I was told that my painting sucks. Spoiler Alert again. Yeah, if its 10 dollars or less, pick it up unless you don't own Outlast. Then buy Outlast and play that instead.",

The game is just impossible to play (probably, those who recommended it have more lucky GPU configurations) and according to an official reply on the game forum the authors consider the quality acceptable and are not going to fix this issue. I will require a refund and will never buy from Bloober Team anything else. It's a shame the game was published without anti-aliasing in 2016.",

The game drops framerates constantly, has a major bug that makes it judder (framrate is choppy and camera moves all herky jerky) and it is more or less unplayable.   The worst part? The devs have completely admitted to the issue, promised for MONTHS to fix it, and now in the latest forum post have literally said that they still haven't figured out how to fix it and have more improtant projects to work on. They have abandoned it entirely. gee, can't WAIT for their next game with customer service like that!  Very sad. Avoid this mess.",

Finished the Early Access version in around 2 hours and here is why I can't recommend Layers of Fear:  The great sound coupled with the fantastic graphics make for a truly awesome atmosphere! BUT the gameplay and lack of horror left me behind bored. The gameplay consists of slowly walking around the house, opening drawers and opening previously locked doors, waiting in the room for a scripted event to happen (most of the time, paintings melt or transform into other paintings) and then opening the now unlocked door to enter the next room with a scripted event. After 1.5h i got my first jumpscare. Before that, literally NOTHING happens expcept for the repetitive waiting-for-doors-to-unlock-in-rooms. There are notes and not-so-subtle hints laying around, waiting to be read. They tell a pretty stereotypical story of a madman. Already seen this one a thousand times. After 2 hours and totally 3 jumpscares, the Early Access version of the game was finished. Me and my easily scared friend both were left behind bored.",

Unfortunately Layers of Fear overuses its ideas and incoming desensitization makes the last two hours (yes, it's short) rather boring. The setting is very interesting, but the actual story doesn't hold up to the expectations.  Bought this game on early access for half price and I can't complain about it. But I don't recommend this at full price.",

            "review_text": "A Tale of 2 games...  Simply put, the first half of the game was phenomenal. I hits the aim of P.T. perfectly, with the use of fluid transitions and a legitimately horror feel. The first half creates an incredible atomsphere of fear, lurking behind every door, every corner, and every interaction with the world...  However, the major difference is the 2nd half of the game. You can easily tell the momentum shifts dramatically and the game slows to the point of being uninteresting. The creativity found in the first half is almost non-apparent in the 2nd half. You end up feeling disappointed that the game started off so well, only to become a major let down.  I played the game during its early access and followed the forums for new updates and the impending release date. I would rather keep my memories of the early access and the first half of the game in mind, and just pretend the game never really ended with the 2nd half.  Massive disappointment. I don't recommend it.",

Well I got to the ending, and that feeling never came. The ending is so open-ended that you'll either make your own conclusions or turn to the forums for explanations.   I've chosen to do neither of those things to remind myself that I shouldn't need to.  This game could have easily divulged more information like any good story should. Everything in this game is scripted: where you go, what you see, etc. It's the perfect atmosphere for effectively telling a story because of how controlled the narrative could be. Unfortunately, the notes, documents, and audio you encounter are essentially garbage because they only serve as descriptions of the story they wanted to tell--instead of being the story itself.",
