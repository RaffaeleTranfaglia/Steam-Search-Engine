They can use more than 60 weapons to defend themselves and save as many survivors as possible. But beware – if too many rooms are thrashed, the end may be nigh-er than you originally thought.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: I was supplied with this key by the developer, this however did not affect the review. All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!   Intro My Night Job is a side-scroller beat’em up taking place in a gigantic mansion filled with a variety of different monsters. Your goal is to lead as many survivors you find throughout the mansion to evacuation points while staying alive. When too many monsters accumulate inside a room, they start stomping and damaging the mansion and the game ends when either your health bar or the mansion's health bar falls to zero.  Graphics The graphics are very old school but retain a certain charm behind them. Even with many characters on screen at once, the graphics are very smooth and you can always keep track of your character.  Gameplay Gameplay is very straightforward. You either move left or right, and you can jump, attack, or dodge. You start out only armed with your fists but there are plenty of weapons you can pick up while moving around the mansion, ranging from couches to refrigerators. All weapons either have a ammo count or limited durability forcing you to constantly be on the lookout for new weapons to pick up. You also receive bonus health or ammo depending on the numbers of survivors you lead to an evacuation point. Special survivors also grant bonus power-ups upon being rescued, giving you abilities such as revival upon death or increased melee damage.  Pros &amp; Cons  Pros: • Very easy to pick up and a single play session does not last very long. • Achievements you unlock grant you permanent bonuses such as increased speed/health but you must unlock them • from a secret room in the mansion first • Unique blend of survival horror and beat'em up  Cons: • Tutorial could be more in depth going beyond basic controls • Weapons are either really strong or weak, enemies usually die in one hit so weapons that have high splash damage • • reign supreme above others • Lack of a story  Overall Thoughts  This is a solid beat'em up game that is great for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. At the moment only single player is supported although I feel this game has great potential for supporting Co-op.
