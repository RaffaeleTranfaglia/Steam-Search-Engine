Have you ever picked up a spoon and started wacking the asphalt in an attempt to make a tunnel to china?  If you have, this game is for you. This game completely and utterly manages to recreate that feeling of hopelessness and complete frustration we all feel when we desperately try to solve at least one equation on the final math test... Bravo. I can do nothing but reccomend this game most wholeheartedly to everyone who feel they deserve a good whipping. In fact, i hereby vote that instead of penal labor, instead of grounding your kids, instead of invading terrorist countries, we enforce this game on all that has been naughty. Now that's something for santa to consider. Have a miserable experience. (After finally reaching level 2, i died within about 0.0001 seconds and realized i'm back to level one. Good luck!)",

            "review_text": "When you break down twitch games to their base elements, they tend to revolve around the same basic concepts: fast gameplay, and dodging things at high speeds. Some excel in their simplicity, like the classic flash game Vector Runner or the more recent Super Hexagon, while others add more complexity, such as Pivvot, Wave Wave, and Duet. Point is, that since the core elements are generally similar, it takes something more, something exceptional for games in the genre to stand out. Velocibox is one of those games, and it's perhaps the most addictive twitch game I've played since Super Hexagon.  Expanded and improved from an entry for the current 'Connected Worlds' Ludum Dare, Velocibox is unforgiving. In fact there aren't any checkpoints, when you fail (and you will), you start over from the first stage. Initially, I disliked this lack of checkpoints, but once I played more, I came to appreciate how the game was set up. Success relies on practice, learning the quirks and obstacles of each stage and surmounting them. It's more than twitch reflex but also adaption and gradual improvement, not just 'one more go' but 'I know these obstacles. I can do better'. It's incredibly satisfying to race through stages that had defeated you countless times before.  But what makes Velocibox exceptional, because that's a pretty strong word? Well, it's more that all the game's aspects merge into a excellent whole rather than any individual element. It's the sense of speed, the feeling of racing forward at some extreme velocity, blasting off from stage one without a moment to catch your breath. It's the gravity-defying gameplay, as you flip between floor and ceiling and ride the walls. It's how the gravity flip mechanic opens the door for a wide variety of obstacles that wouldn't be possible in other twitch games, forcing you to deftly maneuver around and across all sides of these corridors. It's the vibrant visuals and effects, the great music, the no-frills presentation that lets you jump into the action in seconds.  I've only reached stage four out of nine, and beating the initial nine stages unlocks an even more insane Super Velocibox mode, so there's a hefty amount of content here. Velocibox is an easy recommendation for fans of the genre.",

Yes, at first might seem a frustrating game, or rather a game with little chance of progressing, but nothing could be more wrong, Velocibox despite the continuous game over gives pure addiction, is one of those games that make you think 'one more turn', finally, so I can safely recommend it.",

I know there is nothing there at the end of this game. But it is something special about it. I recall my first attempts to play this game. It was horrible. It was after several hours of unsuccessful attempts and 'wtf am i doing wrong? are you telling me i cant do this?' moments that I reached level 2 and 3. And it was amazing experience. I am so glad that i kept playing it at first. The feeling I've got when I reached those new levels I thought was impossible before was absolutely worth it. I don't regret it at all. And trust me. This game will beat you to death. I like how this game messes with you and your mind. I like how the game keeps throwing stuff at you as you progress. Every new level offers nothing more but death to you. I like how there is no time to think and no room for mistakes. You have to be perfect, go ahead, plan your moves and sh#t. It is not an easy type game there's no practice mode, no easier path or smth, the game offers no helping hand for you (except that init mode which is useless). Every time you fail you'll go from the beginning even though it was only a hair from that damn obstacle or a wrong button you pressed or a millisecond delay of your thought. The game is responsive and fair. It's your fault that you can't play it. It gets very frustrating at times I admit it. But every time you fail there's nothing more to judge but you. It is about challenging yourself, progressing at it and the feeling you get then you're finally good at it.",
