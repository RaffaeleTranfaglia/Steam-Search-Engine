            "review_text": "This can be conciderd a hidden gem(?)  For the age of this simulator i am going to have to say it is actually quite realistic. You can change the difficulty from limmited ammo to your pilot getting blinded by the sun. Also the A.I are suburb. enemy pilots are quite a challenge and difficult to shoot. ships also try to avoid you when you are getting close to them! (enemy ships of course) For the flight sim fans this is a must have, get it now it is on sale!  1 thing i noticed is that the steam store tells there is no multiplayer, But according to the manual and in game options there is. But it is called Modem flight or something. Not sure how to do that. I tried to take a look but if you figure around a bit it should maybe be possible to use.",
