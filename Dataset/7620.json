If you like these tycoon games, this is definitely one to try, if for no other reason than to have tested this old classic.  The simulation is satisfactory, and buying a brand new train model and putting it to work on new laid tracks up the mountains gives a sense of achievment many new games fail to instil in the player.  A safe buy for tycoon fans, even though it's old.",

You need to make money to can get connected to another town. You need to consider what you can offer and what the other town needs. When you can't provide what the other town needs you will make no money. it's a time consuming game but i like it.",

I gave it a half hour and just couldn't keep going, compared to playing Sid Meier's Railroads!. There's some nostalgia here if you can put up with very poor graphics (for instance, train cars will 'step' up and down hills rather than rotate, and shading is done with hatching rather than alpha). It was more fun before I got spoiled on newer, better versions. I recommend Sid Meier's Railroads! instead. This isn't worth even a couple bucks.",

I was poking around with a ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to understand the interface. The ♥♥♥♥♥ was supposed to represent an upside down hammer, but it pretty much looked like a ♥♥♥♥♥! The interface and controls are also horrible. You can't move the camera with your mouse, AND you need to press a ♥♥♥♥ing button for EVERYTHING. THERE ARE NO KEYBINDINGS. You need to poke on the map with your '♥♥♥♥♥' to move around. There are also annoying popups every 15 second. This game were MAYBE good back in the days, BUT NOT TODAY. DON'T BUY IT!",

There are a variety of difficulty settings in the scenario mode so you can make the game a lot easier for yourself if you're just looking to understand the game mechanics.  There are a lot of elements to the game including: managing your business, playing the stock market, building rail, buying and maintaining locomotives and working out consists so you're supplying every industry and city with what it needs while still making money. Even though it only runs at a low resolution, the game is beautiful with its huge maps, vegetation and mountains that really give it incredible scale.  If you want to sink 30+ hours into a game, this is incredible value.",

I started a passenger/mail train running from Minneapolis to Seattle in the late 1800's. Jesse James robs the first run, I'm annoyed, but figure OK, it's a one off. The next one will surely give me the big payoff. Second run takes off, Jesse James robs it again, wondering where the US cavalry are and why they aren't protecting my assets. Third run, this one has to make it, Jesse James robs it again! Who the hell do I have to bribe in the government to get some protection here?!  Finally, the news arrives! Jesse James has been caught, yay! I will finally see that route pay off the way I expected from the start. Fourth train takes off from the station, steaming along, no Jesse James in sight, woohoo! Then Indians attack it!   10/10 Would set up the Minneapolis/Seattle run again!",
