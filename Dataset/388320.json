            "review_text": "Like most other Iranians, I get very excited about anything that has to do with us and our history, so when I heard about this game's existence I bought it right away. Now that I finished my first time playing it, as much as I hate to ruin the 69 reviews I thought I could share my thoughts:  I can't recall any other game that really focused on a historical event like this and not only told the story but also let the player become a part of it. You can make some choices that really help your character or the ones around him, or be their doom. That's already something that quite a few big game titles don't manage. But the story telling is flawed. Some characters have no personality or are so rarely there that there is really no reason to care for them, and there aren't many characters to begin with. I ended up only caring for two characters, and the second mostly just because his role just hit home for me. And just when things are really heating up, the game ends. And it's not even a big ending that really feels like one, it's more like listening to music and during the chorus your speakers just suddenly die. A lot of questions should have been answered, but aren't even mentioned again, and you simply don't get much deeper into what was happening which is a pity.  The gameplay was not that interesting for me aside from choosing what to say and occasionally how to act. What you can do most of all is looking for things and collecting them, which then give you a little insight on both what was happening during the revolution and also Iranian culture as it was back then and still is now, which is neat for those who don't know much about Iran but still perhaps too little for those who really know nothing. More important information can be collected by taking photos, and you do that in a very basic 'click at the right moment' minigame. Depending on how well the photo turns out, the more information you get. There's also everybody's favourite thing in gaming history: Quick time events! *sarcasm* Also, on two occasions I had to patch up people who were hurt and I have to say that that were just silly. Especially having to put bandages around the wounds, it looked really bad and out of place compared to the style in the rest of the game.  The game looks alright. It's rather obvious to tell which character models were worked on longer and which ones were rushed, and in just one scene, standing on one spot, I could count up to almost 10 copy-pasted NPCs. But I really did like the style they went with and enjoyed looking at the character I play. The environments were also done nicely, it really reminded me of walking down a street in Tehran.  I have the luck of rarely ever getting glitches and such in games, but there was this one point where I walked into a half circle of people in the hope that I could collect something in the middle, but then Babak closed the circle and I couldn't get out because he just wouldn't move. I had to restart the whole sequence and stay away from groups from then on which probably made me miss out on some things.  So, tl;dr: while this game is very flawed, it does go down an interesting path and I did enjoy my time playing it. It doesn't cost much, so I do recommend it as both a small 'collect stuff and achievements' game if you enjoy those and an alternative to a short and probably biased documentary.",

            "review_text": "I got this game because it seemed like a grittier, more realistic take on a Telltale-like adventure game. It's certainly more realistic, but that's simply because of the subject matter: it's historical, not using some comic book or sci-fi movie as its foundation. Indeed, the setting and the events of the time are the most interesting parts of the game. Sadly, that's not enough to make a game  good .  Just like an indie movie, the pacing struggles throughout. By far the best moments are when it picks up and you finally feel a sense of urgency. Unfortunately the same can not be said for a sense of agency. I got the impression that my choices would have very little effect on anything, and sure enough, they didn't.  The story focuses on a few different characters, but the length is so short and we know so little about them that it's hard to care aabout what happens. The culture and circumstances are also far enough away that they're difficult to relate to. And again, not having a lot of time to adjust makes it hard to immerse oneself in the world.  Every character felt like they were preaching about something - some viewpoint or moral or position. This added to a lack of emotion makes it a bit hard to stay invested and interested, as it sounds like you're just being lectured to for most of the game.  There are some neat collectibles; the photo mechanic to acquire them was fun and added to making the environments seem real. But the quick time events were annoying and not particularly well-exected. Some only flashed on the screen for a second or were hard to read while others used obscure icons with no text or explanation. Lastly, some of the collectibles were mutually exclusive with each other (for no good reason I could find) which meant having to restart a chapter to acquire them all. This was particularly frustrating because you can't skip dialogue or cutscenes and there's no sprint. In a word: slow.  The icing on the cake is an atrocious cliffhanger ending. Nothing is resolved, despite this supposedly being a full, standalone game.  This is a story worth telling, but a game might not have been the best medium for it. If you're heavily interested in the place and time then I'd probably still recommend it, but for everyone else I'd wait for an indie movie version. With a different ending it'd be worth the ticket price.",

            "review_text": "Very short(I finished it in 2 hours) but well worth the purchase as it was very well done, although the ending was rather abrupt and unexpected and didn't tie up any loose ends. I learnt quite a lot about the circumstances surrounding the Iranian revolution and the background behind the present day situation. It maintained a fairly objective stance about the revolution, even though it was told from the point of view of the revolutionaries. I also learnt quite a bit about Iranian culture and traditions. Very similar to Telltale games in structure and style, and also less buggy. I hope I see some more similar historical games from these devs as it was very enjoyable.",

Thanks goes to developers for this awesome historical adventure.",

            "review_text": "If you're looking for gameplay and length, this is not the game for you.  If you're looking for an exciting story that respectfully and accurately reflects the Iranian revolution of the late 70's, look no further.  The voice acting and dialog work well to immerse the player in the story, which itself is a careful balance between historically complex and emotional material. The characters' motives make sense in context of their experiences, and many decisions in the game that only lend themselves to bad consequences show how dire the situation really was.  It's clear that the game was made by an indie developer. Animations of extras are crude and 3d models are recycled, but this doesn't take away much from the experience and the game accomplishes everything it sets out to do very well. If you're interested in history or other cultures, you must pick this up. Hopefully, we'll see more games like this in the future.",

I can see that a lot of efford has been put into the gathering of information and research of the revolution. This game left me full of emotions and I am realy glad that games like this make it to the market. The movement of a main character is little bit clunky and be also wary that the game is relatively short, but that are my only cons. It was worth the money and I definatelly recomend this game!",

The story and the characters had 0% of development.  As a half-finished documentary is good. As a game is just not worth it.  ",

You would imagine a similar game based in my own country would be even better, and it could have been, but it wasn't.  ' Side Note ' They mentioned the political factions in Iran like, 5 seperate times, it's more of the clunky dialogue I mentioned earlier but it stands out. ",

The game opened on a really strong note, but I felt the tone slowed down, which might have been necessary to deliver more narrative, and allow for time to explore the streets and understand more about the revolution.   Game is very short, 2-3 hours. But the beauty of it is, the game designer didn't try to favor any side over the other, but rather let you live the historical conflict, and form your own difficult decisions.   One thing I truly loved about the game is the music. Enjoyed it all over.   My advise is to try this very unique kind of historic game, both as an experience, and support to encourage more future games like this.",
