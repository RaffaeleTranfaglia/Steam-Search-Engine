            "review_text": "Neat game if very short: 6 worlds which are easy to beat with the health upgrades you get after every boss fight. It's not a metroidvania, it's just pure arcade platform with no backtracking. Just levels to beat one after another.  PROS: -Nice pixel art. -Fast gameplay. -Well done boss fights. -Satisfying final battle (if tough). -Simple and effective magic system.  CONS -The main character has way much momentum in her moves. Difficult to navigate or step on small plats sometimes. -Barrier magic is unuseful. -You're likely to get hit when navigating downwards. -Way too short.  Am I seeing a sequel with tons of looting, magic and more weapons with the same arcade premise?",

            "review_text": "  Went in thinking things might get frustrating came out with the best old school experience since Shovel Knight. Controls are where I was most impressed spot on jump and combo system and you can hold to any walls making navigation pretty easy. Difficulty is being ridiculously exaggerated by some people, expect to do maybe 3-4 retrys to get through the first boss and from there it depends how good you are",

The only downside I can see to this game so far, is that the coins can sometimes get stuck in walls, which can be especically irrating when trying to escape acid and collect coins at the same time. However it takes away little from the gameplay, which is excellent. My favourtie thing about this game so far though is the animation in the game, as the fire spell and the sword slash looks pretty damn awesome.",

In my opinion this is one of the best games of this year so far that i have played. the game has tight controls, beautiful pixelart, a great soundtrack and some unique mechanics. The only problem i can really find with it at this time is that you have to use the D-Pad on the controller and no adjustible controls but its easy enough to get used to. and even if it is kinda short it still is an amazing adventure for 5 dollars. I highly reccomend this game.",
