            "review_text": "I am past day 200 in the game I am over half way, because I have 3 stars out of six, the game may start out slow when you don't know what to do next, just talk to each person and you will find the way to each step so far I have a B&amp;B getting my 4th renter on my farm, also make sure the animals are fed even though they demand such high quality stuff. I didn't feed the goat and it slowed down my progress in the game- the more you play the better it gets and its adorable and it is alot like Our love will grow 1 but with a twist - there are not alot of people here but I know them all by name- they all give clues for each step of the way- its another adorable game by John Wizard for 3.99 its worth alot more as far as creative game play- its better than the 12.99 Worlds Dawn- if John Wizard puts out more games like this even with a bigger price tag- its worth 15. compared to other game you pay more and get less- I will buy his games again! Very well designed- interesting and so addictive- Don't even listen to anyone who has not really played the game- they gave up way to soon- 6 hours into the game is to soon! I finished our love will grow-1 and this one is just as good!   Enjoy-10/10",
