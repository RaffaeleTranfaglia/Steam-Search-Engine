            "review_text": "C-RUSH is a sci-fi 2D shooter with a couple cool ideas, game gives the option to double your firing space so you can hit two enemy units at the same time, and a normal one fire shot which is more powerful. There is a blaster fuel bar, which you will have to maintain to keep it on the highest damage level by constantly recharging it with passing the special stations on the go. The controls are your old buddy WSAD or arrows and any button to shoot, but you will have to setup it first, since itâ€™s not comfortable for the user by default. You are tasked to do a normal type of fly and shoot missions with constant obstacles on the way and the epic boss at the end of it all. Might feel a bit hard at the beginning but practice do the wonders. The graphic is surprisingly high. A game will be a new addition for gamers who r into 2d shooters to test their skills, though any gamer might find in it something special for himself to enjoy.",

            "review_text": "The game looks and sounds great, but unfortunatley the controls are not that good and that makes the game unplayable.  The controls are too touchy. Navigating through the small passages without hitting the walls or trying to move around enemies without accidently touching them is very difficult. You will lose most of your lives in this game not from getting hit by enemy fire, but from accidently touching a wall or an enemy ship.  I used a controller setup with rapid fire, so anything in front of me was going to be destroyed (as long as I could line up the shot with the touchy controls). Even with that, after playing for an hour, I could not get through the first level.  I enjoy difficult games that have a learning curve, but this game is difficult for the wrong reasons.",

            "review_text": "C-RUSH is a simple arcade game where you fly around as a spaceship from a top-down view and shoot your enemies. There is no tutorial whatsoever and not even any settings at all. You can't even change the sound levels, let alone any graphics or gameplay options. Also, the controls are clunky and there is a huge black bar across the middle of the screen when playing. In this bar the level name and number is shown, but the bar never goes away. This makes playing the game very frustrating.",

Otherwise it is the most unisipred shooter I have ever seen - and that is saying a lot because I've seen a crapton of shooters.  There are two types of stage enemies not includeing bosses. The pew-pew sound effects are awful and the music was insipid.  The graphics are very shiny 3D objets that are bland beyond words. Your ship is basiclly a C with a spike sticking out of it that can turn on it's side to navigate some of the utterly repetitive tunnel sections.  Even if you bought this game for a dollar remeber you must still spend your time playing it and it's not worth it by a long shot.",

If you like SHUMPS but don't need a very good version then get this game. If you like SHUMPS and get it free in a bundle play it. If you don't care for SHUMPS, this will not make you like them.  It's not bad for a shump, so thumbs up. (Just)  ",

            "review_text": "Background: Picked up for next to nothing in a bundle  The Good: * Nice bold design work (probably due to mobile device target platform) * Initially seems interesting  The Bad: * Keyboard layout makes no sense. * Controller overrides keyboard * Shooting mechanic changes without warning * No resolution control * Predictable attack waves  Impressions: If this is a work in progress it's worth a minimal price (pennies/cents) for a side scroller with some original looking enemies attacking in generic waves.  Recommended for: Low stakes, side scrolling shooter to pass some time.  Conclusion: 3/10. Okay as a work in progress (will upgrade review if so) but worthless if this is it.",
