Randomness plays a big role in who wins, but with proper character and card selection, you can generally tip the odds in your favor against AI (at least on normal difficulty, and except for the maps that are meant to be hard). 100% OJ also has online multiplayer with easy matchmaking, so if you don’t like playing against AI getting into a game with real people is quick and easy.  Fully recommend it if you like board games or just looking for a fun casual game to play!",

I have spent most of my time trying to beat the campaign (mostly getting roflstomped by CPU) and I am impressed by the assortment of cards and characters that the game provides. All the units have their unique qualities even though they are not all born equal.   At times, I was extremely frustrated due to the RNG nature of any game that involves rolling the dice. I also experienced even more frustration at how overpowered the final boss of the game is.  Despite this, I genuinely had a good time collecting all the cards and completing specific challenges offered by the game's given achievements. Some of them were quite hard, some were tedious, and some were gained just from pure luck. This is a game that you should try to enjoy with good friends (especially if you want some of the harder achievements).  5/5 I would gladly buy a 4-pack on top of copy I already own when this game goes on sale.  Edit 1: The DLC is quite affordable and brings a good amount of content to boot!",

            "review_text": "I'm revamping this review, as my last one which I had made months ago was meant as a in-joke, which probably isn't the ideal approach. So, where do I begin?   100% Orange Juice  is a board game featuring characters across multiple games from the Japanese indie group  daidai  (who are better known as  OrangeJuice  among the populace). The game premise is to move around the board obtaining stars and/or wins from successful battles, which allow you to increase your Norma level, which in turn allows access to cards. Cards play a vast role in  100% Orange Juice  by changing the scenarios in and outside of battle. Some common examples are having access to two dice for movement, healing yourself after a battle, and setting traps which can slow down other players. Due to the versatility of cards, you will find yourself always trying out different deck creations.  The largest component is the multiplayer, which many regular players would suggest as an additional place to learn as many people will provide suggestions or solutions to what may not be visibly clear even after playing for a while. In addition, as you progress through multiplayer, you will be able to purchase new items from an in-game shop. These include card packs, additional attire colors, boards, among other goodies. Stars, the currency within are obtained upon each completed game, and you earn bonuses for fulfilling certain goals.  Now, rather than just state what has already been stated in reviews regarding how the game works... I feel that I need to put my own thoughts out. Not as a way to intice you, the reader, to buying this game. That is entirely up to your discretion. However, until  100% Orange Juice  became a common occurance for myself, and many other regular players who I've met up to this point, I don't think there was a single game I could really be satisfied with, outside of those 'in-the-moment' games such as  Mass Effect ,  Fallout: New Vegas , and  Persona 3  to name a few examples. They're all great games, but after you hit the 'end' point, that was it. I had no real desire to go back to any of them.   100% Orange Juice ... doesn't stand in that same line, for me, personally. It's one of those games I honestly cannot explain to anyone unfamilar with it in why I still enjoy playing it. I've seen so much progress and change from when I had first started up to its current iteration, that it just feels like a new game, yet also entirely familiar.  Fruitbat Factory , who has brought us this game from what was once a small project that  daidai  had moved on from beforehand, is now incredibly fleshed out. I'm not going to lie to you. If this game was sold as it was originally contrasted as; a board game with fun characters but also fairly limited in selection alongside a sparse choice of playing options, I would have suggested to move on.  This isn't the case.  100% Orange Juice , without a doubt, has enough content through free updates to make 'GOTY' rereleases look absolutely fruitless in comparison. The support and care that  Fruitbat Factory  alongside  daidai's  commitment to providing a bridge for the dedicated playerbase through additional content and supplemental changes over time is commendable.  Without making this seem like a love letter from someone who absolutely adores this game, I would like to just clear some things up on a neutral level. First of all, the DLC availiable for purchase. If you are starting out with  100% Orange Juice , due to picking it up in a sale or as a gift, then I highly urge you to play the base game first and hold off on the DLC to give yourself some room to breath. The mechanics with additional characters alongside their ambigious nature would leave a tightrope in your way, if you were to go from characters who are fairly simple in nature to ease you in, to characters made with card synergy and an outside-of-the-box approach in mind. The second part is approach. Where do you begin first? If you're looking for general gameplay tips, the Community Guides are fairly in-depth and will make what looks like a game with concise rules build a foundation where strategy plays a larger role.  Where you go from there is entirely up to you. Hopefully you'll enjoy the journey and have fun alongside others, alongside the traditional displeasure of our lord RNGesus making you fall to a boss.  As for me? I have some excess plushies that need to be picked up by my friends. Hopefully they don't mind~  Krilaisbestgirl ",

The game's assets are not triple A material by any means, but is well polished and works great. The characters, cards, maps, bgm, sound effects, etc are all endearing and very enjoyable.  I had so much fun playing this game. So so so much fun. But now all my friends are dead, or have left me in disgust. This game does terrible things to people. At first, the malice that takes root in your heart is nothing but the result of a natural competitive drive. It grows within you, and as the finish line approaches, it whispers at you words of betrayal, sabotage, and subversion. We've all felt it before, using ghosts to steal stars in a certain party game, or using blood drenched shells to topple your friends in a kart racing game... but it is nothing compared to the devilish desire for victory that 100% Orange Juice instills upon your fragile mind.  You would see your former comrades burn and wither away, just for the sake of attain glorious norma. They will cry in agony, beg and pray, to cease your ascension to the 6th level of corruption BUT NAY, YOU HEED NO WORDS OF THE PLEBEIANS WHO DARED CHALLENGE YOU AT 100% ORANGE JUICE, THEIR LAST ATTEMPTS AT APPEALING TO YOUR SENSE OF PITY LANDS NAUGHT ON YOU NOR THE RNG GODS, FOR YOU ARE A WINNER, BAKSING IN THOSE RAINBOW LETTERS, YOU CELEBRATE UPON THE CORPSES YOU'VE TRAMPLED UPON.   But only once the euphoric high wears off and your adrenaline clears... only then do you realize your mistakes. The carnage left behind. This game. It will leave your friends list empty. I have to start over from scratch now, as if I were a trasnfer student at an oriental high school. And never, will I ever recommend playing 100% Orange Juice with them.",

            "review_text": "100% Orange Juice is a board game developed by Orange Juice, starring the characters from their games (such as Sora, Suguri or QP Shooting) in one big crossover battle, with four players fighting against each other (or... avoiding confrontation to just accomplish the objective in peace while everyone else is out for blood) to complete 'normas' and gain levels until someone achieves level five and wins the game.  The players take turns to use cards, roll dice, move around the board, and either attack other players, or interact with the tile they landed on. The main goal is to complete 'normas' to level up (which gives you more stars per turn, as well as the ability to use stronger cards) via either stars or combat wins, decided whenever you level up. The main goal is to achieve norma level 5 before the other players do.  Since this is a board game, RNG has a lot of impact here, deciding everything from moving to fights. Those who aren't blessed by the Random Number God should be aware about the kind of sadistic pain this game might inflict upon you. I personally suggest not taking it too seriously - it's a party game, after all. Because of that, it's best played with friends, both for laughs and the fact that single player campaign, while having rather hilarious dialogues, feels as if the CPU players were cheating (and the final boss does actually cheat). Unfortunately you have to beat your starter's campaign to be able to gain access to majority of the other playable characters as well as other starters and their campaigns. And that's nothing in comparison to   Tomomo Hell and unlocking the playable version of the final boss.    The game also has, surprisingly, a ton of replayability. Every match with your friends is gonna look different. There are sixteen different boards to play on, and almost twenty different characters to play as (not counting the DLC characters that come out every now and then to keep the game fresh), each one possessing their own stats, strengths, weaknesses, gimmicks, and (the humanoid ones at least) their own unique Hyper card. Outside of those, there is also another forty or so different cards to use (with around ten more as DLC). While the final outcome is inevitably mostly thanks to RNG, you can vary your playstyle anywhere between passive and aggressive, as well as using character gimmicks to your advantage. Also, you gain experience and stars (currency for the in-game shop) to unlock and buy cosmetics, new characters, new cards, and other things.  In aesthetical department, all characters look different, most of them obviously swinging towards the 'cute' side. The little sprite animations they make in different situations (winning, getting KO'd etc.) are also pretty hilarious to watch. Meanwhile, the music seems to be mostly borrowed from other doujin games (I personally have recognized one piece), but it's a rather varied selection overall, with some rather catchy tunes.  Overall, the game is fun, even if frustrating at times, and is very addictive when playing together with friends or complete strangers. I can recommend it to anyone who has a thing for board games, or just having a good time with people you know.",

The art style took some getting used to, and probably deters many a would-be buyer, but as a board sim, it shines in the department of sometimes giving outgunned players a chance to turn things around unlike most popular games. This element of luck presents more than one end result to a game, letting every player taste victory at least once in a while, and keeps me from becoming 'that guy who plays too much.'",

Now you may think this is a simple fun game but trust me the RNG gods did not bless this game. During the story mode you will be screaming in frustrastion so loud that your neighbors call the police to check if everything is okay even though they know you live alone, trust me I know. I have the exp.  Now the only fun part of this is playing with your friends and the worst part is doing the story mode because you want to unlock your waifu but with each failure you really need to sit down and ask 'Is she worth it?'

I personally put of buying the game because I thought I'd need to know the characters, but after playing the game I realized that knowledge wasn't necessary.   As for the game itself, it is described by many as really hard, mainly because of how much it uses RNG to determine outcomes. I do however think that this builds into one of the game's main strengths. Because while luck is important, just as important is your ability to manipulate that luck using the cards that you're given.   And that leads me to another very interesting mechanic of the game. Because the game is also a deckbuilding game. Every player creates a deck of 10 cards, and then all the decks created are shuffled together, and it's this pile of cards the players draw from. This creates strategic choices where you have choose the cards that are good for your character, but not good for the other characters.

And you will LIKE IT! 10/10 will need rehab.  ---------------- Seriously, though, this game is amazing. While some audiences might be put off by certain aspects of this game's 'cover', the game itself is actually very fun with replay value through the roof! The game is balanced, well-developed, and surprisingly deep. While RNG elements are very prevalent in this game, there is a certain amount of skill introduced with the cards, battle system, and choosing your path on the board (ie. where to go, who to fight, and whether or not to stop at home). The battle system is simple, yet not any more or less so than necessary. The characters are all balanced and the varying stats between them is a welcome difference as compared to Mario Party. The multiplayer is only lacking because there aren't enough people playing this game yet (which needs to change). But the people there so far are amazing. I hop into the middle of a game as a spectator and made a new friends before even becoming a player (and it wasn't a random FR, for the record). Everything balances out in terms of randomness and difficulty. You'll find yourself having days where you can't win anything, and then you'll bne like me where you win 3 MP games in a row as Yuki, then come in second to Yuki on Tomomo's board, only to win against Tomomo the following round and feel like a lumberjacking boss. Anyone can win/lose to anyone else. No two games ever wind up the same, and even the DLC is balanced. More constant fun than many games give you for significantly less than any AAA title on the market.  Seriously, 10/10. Would  rage  buy agian.

            "review_text": "100% Orange Juice is a game that when you look at it, seems very similar to Mario Party. In a sense, it is. You collect Stars and cards in order to help you progress through the game. You roll a dice and move around the board and land on a space that has various effects ranging from you to collecting stars or cards, to losing stars and fighting enemies. Now, that's where the similarities end really. 100% OJ is by far more rutheless than Mario Party. Maybe it's just my luck, but even on normal the cpus are brutal and out for blood. If you make one wrong move, or if the game decides it hates you then you can very well go from a blazing lead to being in dead last within the span of a few turns. Now, despite that, the game itself is a lot of fun. Sure, it's a board game with goals that range from collecting a certain amount of stars, knocking out a certain amount of people or a combination of the both.   The game has only 3 modes really, campaign, single matches and multiplayer. Now with any board game, playing with friends is what makes it really shine a bit more. You can play with up to three other friends, using whatever characters you unlocked, making a deck of x amount of cards and then you're put into a board, fighting or running for your life (depending on your play style and character as all characters have different stats.) in order to gain first prize. Now, with all three game modes you ear stars (which are this games currency to buy items from the store.) But only in multiplayer can you gain exp to level up and unlock new items to purchase and the sort, which the game has a decent amount of. Honestly, I suggest giving the demo a try to get a feel for the game, then convince some friends to get the game as well or find some people that would want to play.

I never feel significantly handicapped by who I'm playing as, except for a few gimmicky exceptions. The card count is high enough to allow for a great number of deck configurations but low enough to be easily accessible. The AI is dumb and gets dice advantages, but the multiplayer community is active and overall very pleasant. I wish there were more boards, maybe even some sort of board-making tool, and there are some crappy ones, but overall there's a good selection. There's an occasional connection issue online, and the DX9 update seems to have caused slowdown for some, myself included, but this is pretty easy to overlook overall. Don't let the DLC scare you off. Because of the way the deck is handled, you can experience a good chunk of DLC without even realizing it, and there's really no paid advantages. Game's definitely worth the full price in my opinion, though I got it on sale. The DLC isn't any gamechanging stuff but it's good to grab on sale. I've gotten a lot of mileage out of OJ and I don't feel burnt out at all. It's a riot with friends and is just a nice experience overall. It sounds stupid, but it's good to have an enjoyable game every now and then which isn't all about blood, guts and murder. Even if the anime style throws you off a bit, as it did for me, it's still massively enjoyable. Turn off voices and you're all set.",

You play a roll your dice move your mice board game, but when you run into other players theres a short battle, sometimes you can play a modifier card before the battle to modify the chances of winning. You can also play a card before your roll at the start of your turn. Some cards can move everyone around, cause you to roll a specific value, place a trap on the board, or place a piggy bank with a bunch of stars.  Now to win the game you need to do one of two things. You need to get a lot of stars (the points or currency of the game) and keep landing on one of the home tiles, or you need to win battles against the CPU enemies, Boss CPU enemies, or your opposing players.  Now the game can be played single player with 3 CPU players or 4 player multiplayer with up to 3 of your friends (over the internet, sadly no type of couch co-op). There's also a single player story mode where you can play various boards with a loose story for why you are on specific boards, why you are playing against specific players, why the board effects are what they are... It's a wacky time, usually resulting in the persuit of pudding.  But be warned, if you don't take care this may be harder than you think, even on the NORMAL difficulty you will encounted painloops with the story, moreso if you do not go to the in game market and buy (with in game money) booster packs so you can get more cards to modify your deck. There are DLC you can buy, and I highly suggest doing so (especially if the game is on sale like it is as I write this review) as some of the DLC characters are fun to play as and the additional cards from the DLC booster packs (still gotta buy them in game with in game currency, which you only get by playing) add some extra fun when making your deck.",

            "review_text": "100% Orange Juice is a quirky board game that mixes in some RPG combat. It's a very interesting premise that could work very wel... but it doesn't. The idea is great, and it's probably enough to hold your attention for a while, but the game's execution is horribly flawed. What will end up happening most times is that all of your careful planning to get to the next level will be thwarted by rolling poorly at the wrong time, and before you get another chance at it, another poor roll will set you farther back.  Let me give you some examples of the terrible game design at work here. Let's start with the 'revive' mechanic. Now, I've never been a fan of anything that skips turns... it's not really fun for anyone. But, if you die at any point, you have to roll each turn to see if you revive (next turn). The rolls get easier with each successive failure, but in practice, I normally lost 3-4 turns each time I went down. What's worse is that you will die several times, and probably about half of your deaths will be due to plain luck.  I have another example. When you pass another player, you can stop on their square and fight them, and when you do, you get the first hit. Interesting idea. What ends up happening, though, is that the second player will try to move forward on their next turn, and then they'll get ganked again by the player in the rear, who will get the advantage again. Basically the only way for the person in front to get out of the way is to roll well, or to win their fights (by rolling well).  Another example. After you get the first level, you have to choose whether to earn the next level with currency (stars) or battle victories. Stars are easy to get, but easy to lose, and I kept losing them just in time to get back to my base and miss out an gaining a level. Battle victories are permanent, but getting in battles isn't as easy as it sounds. And then, you have to get back to a home square, which you have to land on exactly unless its your own, but I kept getting warped away from my own home tile.  Also, this game comes with no tutorial, and that's an enormous downside for me. Thankfully, the rules are not that hard, and there's a manual, so it's not a dealbreaker like it has been in other games.  Really, when it comes down to it, this game is about 80% luck with 20% skill, and for me, that's not an attractive quality in a board game.  Other than that, the game has some cute, colorful chibi art, and the game looks pretty nice, except that I found the card text to be too small on my monitor. The music is fine, and it all controls well enough with the mouse.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game at any price, really. I just didn't have any fun with it.",

            "review_text": "When I tell people about 100% Orange juice, the first reply I receive is always something along the lines of 'So it's kind of like Mario party?' and I can see why people would come to that conclusion, but in practice 100% Orange Juice is a completely different animal.  100% Orange Juice is a board-game inspired battle game in which players compete to achieve 'Norma', a series of objectives based around either defeating various critters as well as the other players in battle, or collecting a number of stars. Stars are the only currency in 100% Orange Juice, and they are used to both fufill objectives and activate abilities that come in the form of cards, and this creates a lot of tough choices, while also preventing needless complication with alternate power sources.  The game provides many (Read: nigh-endless) opportunities for a comeback from players who are trailing behind, so unlike when someone has 5 stars in mario party and the turn limit has almost been reached, in 100% Orange juice you may find yourself winning at the last minute due to smart play, luck, or poor decision making from another player.   Initially, a lot of the content is unavailable for new players, but all of it is unlocked by playing the game. All new cards are recieved by buying booster packs with stars won from playing games. The basic booster pack contains most of the cards available, but later an expansion series becomes unlocked with a different variety of cards. The rarity and randomness of the card drops is a little annoying, but once you've recieved nine of any card, you'll stop getting it, meaning that eventually you'll get every card.   The single player mode is definitely challenging, and going in to a mission without a plan can make it extremely hard. Each of the four starting characters has a seperate campaign, and by beating all of them you'll receieve a set of extra scenarios that have interesting setups to create additional challenge for more experienced players.    I'd imagine most western players wouldn't recognise the characters used to make up the playable cast, but even if that's the case, it's still a very enjoyable game. Most people I gave the game to were capable of playing decently during their first match without much more than a brief introduction to the mechanics, so needing to memorise an encyclopaedia of rules, or knowing character matchups really isn't a hinderance to getting started.   All in all, it's a very solid game. I definitely recommend you play with other people, whether they be friends or otherwise. If you're having trouble finding people to play with, the official group chat generally has people playing or people who want to play, so stop by there and say 'Hi!' if you're needing some friends to play with.   The support for this game has been pretty awesome. I normally buy doujin games expecting a somewhat finished product that won't really change much from its inital incarnation, but the patches released since 1.0 have really changed the game for the better. The character balancing and addition of playable bosses with unique mechanics gives the game a lot more longevity than was originally present. The character balance is pretty good, with the only questionable character having a toggle switch to allow them to be played in a lobby or not. Depending on who's asked, or whether a player is lucky or not, Tomomo will either be an unstoppable winning machine, or just above average with interesting drawbacks.   I don't like numeric ratings, but if I had to rate 100% Orange juice, I would give this game a 8.5/10. It's not perfect by any means, but delivers on everything I expected it to, while also providing a lot of opportunity for having a good time.  As an aside, the 4-P bundle is pretty awesome in comparison to a lot of other games, paying for a little more than two copies to get two more nearly free. Generally I'm offput by those types of deals, but if you want to get friends into the game it's a pretty good purchase.",

Nothing you do matters. Nothing you try will succeed unless the Random Number Generator wills it so. You will witness a player on full HP use their strongest cards against a player with no cards and 1 HP... and lose. You will be two spaces from winnng the game and the game board will reverse direction on you. You will be carrying 500 stars and just 'happen' to roll the exact number that will dump you on the boss NPC's tile where he will proceed to play your ♥♥♥ like a banjo before taking all of them.  Well, not  all  of your stars. You only lose half of them when you're KO'ed. But that's ok. The moment you revive some other player will swoop in like Tarzan meets Chris Brown and beat another half of your stars from you, essentially relegating you to the position of spectator while all the other players race around levelling up from their ill-gotten gains.  Does this sound fun? If so, congratulations, you are a masochist! The truth is that in 9/10 matches you play, this game is  not  fun. It's frustrating beyond all words and the only saving grace is that the one match that you win will feel like heaven for the 5 seconds you have before you crank that handle again. In the end though, it's not worth it the misery it will inflict upon you.  Save yourself. Save your genitals. Don't open the box.",

Sound: Boring sound effects and the moonspeak will cause ear bleeds.  Music: Hashed out midi tunes that seem like they are less than a minute each. Hardly any variety, and the five songs cycle through very quickly.  Controls: Everything is controlled with the left mouse button.  Did I Finish It: No.  Will I Finish It: Definitely not.

They're my thing, mainly because I get drunk all the time and when I get drunk anything else is jus too frustrating to play.  Basically, it's a board game. you roll a die, move X number of spaces, do a thing based on where you land(fight an enemy, fight a player, drop stars, gain stars, gain a card). Battles are very simplistic, you choose to defend(guarantee of losing at least one health) or evade(either take the full hit or take no damage), and then(or before that) you roll for attack. It works pretty well especially for what the game is going for.   Cards are pretty much the only area strategy really comes into play. You gain them randomly and they provide a wide range of effects. Some take stars, some give stars, some are traps you can set, some hurt other players, etc. Besides stars you have 'norma' which is how you win the game. You can either choose star normas or fighting normas. Norma basically means 'goal' at least in this game. Either choose star norma and spend the game struggling to hold onto your stars, or choose fighting normas and spend the game looking for players to kill. It all makes for a good party game.  The graphics and sound are unimpressive. The game has a cute aesthetic, which is fun, and the sounds all sound very stock.

And this is a game where the outcome is determined primarily by Random Number Generator. Yes, you have to win these games as well. And yes, these games all take about half an hour. And yes, there are four players. And yes, because you are playing offline, there is no player interaction at all. Are you starting to see the problem here?  Why the hell would you make the campaign MANDATORY when it's the game without half the elements that make it fun in the first place!?  There is NO other way to unlock these characters, and it's not just a few characters locked behind campaigns, it's  most of them . If you want these characters, you are obligated to toil endlessly against hours and hours and  hours  of RNG hell in a party game without the party. Thank Jesus Christ for Cheat Engine.

This is my first, lol  That aside, i follow the consensus that this game is similar to the 'mario party' board game style. It's cute with it's chibi style, but the game feels more like its playing itself more than i'm playing it. There is a moderate amount of luck involved -- you're rolling dice, this is expected. There are just situations where a game can drag on for what seems forever if multiple people get bad rolls in a row.   Feels like one of those games i'd play a few times, then likely never touch again. Not bad for the price, i guess? ",

Mechincally the game is sound, and it's decent fun with friends, recapturing the mario party style decently well. Unfortunately, there's a rather glaring flaw; the random number generation.   Now, normally that's not something I'd complain about, 'random' by definition can be anything, be it good or bad. The problem is that it doesn't feel random, it feels loaded. HEAVILY loaded. Playing the AI, either in free mode or the story, does not feel like a challenge, it feels like an exercise in stubborness. It's not 'Trying this will win,' It's 'Will the game let me win.' Or even worse, 'Will the game let me play,' That's not me trying to be funny. I've seen multiple games that have gone to fifty or sity turns, and one player or another has been dead for at least fourty. The distinct lack of any kind of grace mechanic to stop spite-kills (Killing someone on respawn) can result in a player being taken outright out of the game.  I've played random before. A D&amp;D session, for example, where I only roll under 10 on my D20 or 1-3 on the 6 is just written off as a bad luck session. They happen. But when this becomes the norm, it's clear you need new dice, or in this game, a fix to the code. In the game's current state, it's far from what it could be. I would gladly reccomend it for anyone wanting old style mario party, but to anyone that remembers that one kid in primary school, the one that always insisted on playing by his rules so he'd win, Yeah....Right now the game is kinda like that all over again.",

This norma makes for a lot of different playing styles, from passively collecting stars to brutaly murdering your fellow players, and anything in between. The game got a lot of good songs, one for each character, and a lighthearty but somewhat short story in its campain mode.  Its got multiple maps, and map events that you can turn on/off or even choose manualy that can change the played map hugely. Online is where this game realy shines. Its realy easy to join other players or make your own lobby for friends or random players.

You have to help your character achieve certain goals (such as collecting stars or beat an amount of enemies). The Player who achieves the goal first wins. In each turn you get to roll the dice once and depending on what square you land on different 'events' are going to happen. For example you can encounter enemies, collect stars or lose them but also find cards. There are many different cards and each has it's own effect. Plus, you are able to beat other players too. If you win the fight, you gain a specific amount of their stars. Each character has different stats (health, attack, evasion and defense) so that you can choose one that fits your current way of playing most. I had a lot of fun with 100%OJ so far but it can make me really mad at the same time. Everything in this game should happen by accident but in the 'story mode' (if you can call it that. It's actually just about pudding) you feel like you are more unlucky as usual. That's what makes me angry sometimes. It should be based on luck but here it's clearly not. However, the game would be too easy if this weren't the case. That's why I'm not completely sure wether that's a good thing or not. You can also play the game online which is the most fun. Luck isn't influenced here, you can play against actual people and also write with them.  All in all, I am having a love-hate-relationship with this game since you can be in first place and in the next turn the last. Sure, that can be annoying but that's also what makes the game exciting. You never know what happens or who is going to win. ;) But I'd say it's definately worth playing.",

I was really bad a Mario Party, so maybe I just suck at these games ;c  Pros (RNG raging fun!): -Super cheap with sales -It's a virtual board game, something you don't see everyday -Lot's of customization -The RNG can make for fun and unfun times with friends (beware the seagulls!) -You don't neccessarily have to strategize, at least I don't and I managed to beat the campaign -There's a campaign! You can play online or you can play the campaign to gain cards and characters   Cons (Things every game has, anime-style or not): -The art can put a lot of people off. I was a bit wary at first because my friends don't really care for this style of stuff and I really didn't want to try to explain it to them. Luckily no one seemed to dig deep into at and you can just call it a board game (because that IS what it is) -The RNG can be BAD at times. Lots of times in multiplayer it can be fun to watch chickens destroy your enemies, but when it happens to you it's pretty devastating -Campaign can be ridiculously hard, took about 30 hours of gameplay (I do kinda suck though) -The games are pretty long sometimes, so you might have to make about 30 minutes  Overall I like the game. Some pros can be cons and vice versa for you, but in sales its really only like $3-5 I'll give the game a 8/10 because thats how much I feel the game deserves.",
