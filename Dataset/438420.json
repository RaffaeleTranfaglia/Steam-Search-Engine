No oneiric or do-it-yourself crap. You won't need to piece the story together by yourself as if it was a swedish chair. We promise.",

            "review_text": "Pros: -Excellent humour.  Cons: -Gameplay is too linear. There is no choice in quest order as each quest literally flows into the next. -Clunky controls and mouse pointer issues. The mouse cursor is hidden and does not relate to its actual position on screen. -No tutorial to explain the control system or a pop-up help screen showing the controls. -Quirky graphic resolutions meant sometimes after entering main menu options screen the resolution changed to a small one but still windowed meaning you lost access to parts of the screen and could only be reset by restarting the game. -No in-game volume controls. -Music becomes boring and repetitive after a while. Does not change during movement or combat to emphasize the changed circumstances. -No voice acting. Voice acting would improve the delivery of the jokes.  Overall: Would not recommend to buy in its current state BUT would recommend it if it was released as a free to play concept demo. May recommend if some of the above concerns are fixed.  EDIT: Refund requested and approved.",

            "review_text": "So this game obviously is a bit rough; i will conced that... however it is crazy fun so far. I am not that far; only 1.3 hours in at the time of review... but so far i have had some really good laughs; found a few 'secrets' that were hillarious and well just had fun... actual 'fun'. I would say if you like games with easter eggs that are comedic, this is an entire basket. I am enjoying it and it is well worth the price! Now don't go in expecting super polished combat, or crazy good graphics... or voice acting. BUT do go in expecting whitty jokes and great in-jokes that really riff on popular culture.   I do wish they had some VO in game; even if was the guy that did the trailer; however i know from experience that can become really expensive. So be ready to read a lot; but what your going to be reading is going to be great and funny... if not a new york time winning novel.   I would not suggest this to the 'action packed' rpg gamer; or the 'man i wish i had a great story' gamer, but for me it hits on note; the moment i ran into the Final Fantasy adventures i almost lost it laughing! Great game so far! Thanks for the laughs!",

            "review_text": "This is Awsome. A brillant work of Imagination mixed with so much great Humor I can Promise you at one point or another you'll Laugh even if you don't want to Be Happy!!! WOW... The Graphics are amazing!! No Major tweaking has to be done and on my system thats saying alot. Combat is very very intense-I would recommend the Win then Save then save again plan. The option of using Magic or Brute Steel force is rewarding. At first to be Honest Argus's mouth is filthy-but then you'll get so emerged you can accept its his behavior and the rest of the cast Mordecai, Claude, Iris, and last but certainly the Best Alana everyone of them are Perfectly fitted into a story plot that supports every RPG fans dreams. The Game flows with a beauty that I've yet to see in any other game. What you expect to happen-well wont, just dont expect anything because the programmers have already thought way ahead of you. Zenith is one of The Best examples of Gaming Mixed with Humor and Strategy. It will sneak up on you before you know it your submerged in a rewarding Story-The type where you know you can Beat the next challenge and when you Do The programmers will reward you with exactly the equipment you need. Equip it wisely though because without Saving you'll be fraustrated at times. Stick with it and you'll be absorbed in one of The Best Games I've seen in years. Thanks for that ride Guys its been Great so far. I just saw flames come outta of cats Butt and Am waiting to see where it Lands...omg!!",

            "review_text": "A small RPG from an indie studio that shines because of its story and humour. It has a nice JRPG retro flavour, with the ways the cameras are fixed in some areas, the barrel breaking and some characters, along with many cameos and references to pop culture.   It has its share of issues, mainly the thunderous music in some areas, slightly clunky controls and combat (I played with mouse+keyboard adn it felt... disjointed) and a lack of configuration options (if that is a problem for you), but for me they where not game breaking issues.  All in all, a good experience in which the story, characters and humour make it worth it over a couple of minor problems.",
