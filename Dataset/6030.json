            "review_text": "I have not played with many Star Wars games throughout my 'gamer career' but what I do remember is the fond memories I have attached to Jedi Outcast. I believe it is supposed to be a sequel to Jedi Knight 1 which is the sequel to Dark Forces 1... all FPS games and very old now and completely missed out by myself.  In any case, Outcast is a blend of FPS and TPS genres. Both perspectives are available throughout the game and they determine the weaponry used to dispose of your enemies. Obviously, weapons such as blasters are for the FPS perspective while wielding your lightsaber is the easiest from a third person perspective.  The game has an excellent story and some recognisable faces appear here and there (strictly following the storyline of the trilogy from the '70s / '80s). Music is, of course, the good-old John Williams-composed score and since they are really good why would we need anything else?  The only issue with the game is that I remember playing it in FPS mode, at first, but once I obtained the lightsaber I finished the rest in TPS mode. I mean, if having a lightsaber is de rigueur in a Star Wars game then why would you want to switch back to the general assortment of weapons? Also, your lightsaber coupled with the many jedi powers available is the best way to play such a game.  The game can be difficult at times but allowing you to follow both paths (i.e. Light and Dark sides) it deserves a second walkthrough. Outcast runs on the Quake 3 engine which, years ago, was quite beautiful but now is somewhat of an obsolete engine. In any case, this is an all-time classic and you are to purchase it especially if you played it already 10 years ago. Collecting classics is always a good pastime!  PS: Widescreen resolutions are unavailable from the game menu - head over to  wsgf.org  to see the solution for the issue.",

            "review_text": "Probably one of the only games i'll ever write a review for but being a diehard Star Wars fan i just have to. So if you are a Star Wars fan searching for a really good game this is the one for you. Sure you'll have to glare over the not as BF1 pretty 2003 graphics but the combat system, story and even the difficulty is well worth it. I for one like a little bit of realism especially when it comes to Star Wars. (pls don't kill me for this but that's why i really like the scene in the phantom menance where Qui-Gon Jin cuts open the door) Which is totally possible in this game with a little bit of autoexec fiddling. Put your lightsaber on cut everthing mode and it finally feels satisfying when you finally slice your way through one of the enemey's shadow troopers or shadow adepts.   So to talk about some of the different aspects of the game.   The prize: If you cant find those 10 Bucks just get it on a sale. I grabbed it for 2€ and got 16 hours of gameplay out of the story alone.   Which also leads me to my next point.    The Gameplay &amp; Difficulty: What really amazed me about this game is that i didnt get bored. New games tend to loose my attention after like 1 1/2 hour but this one just grabbed me and pinned me to my seat ... for hours. Reason for this is that the difficulty is getting procedurely harder as you are getting better and more used to the game. I don't even know how often i reloaded my save after a lousy shadow adept ripped my head of, electrified my corpse and send my remains straight down a cliff. Added to that there is some thinking involved in almost all of the levels aswell which made me actually feel dumb after finally finding an exit or something comparable after 10 minutes of searching and consulting a walkthrough. So if you are looking for a challenge too, this is your game.     Story: Talking about story in the Star Wars franchise which isn't directly related to any of the movies was and is always a dangerous path with Star Wars fans. Take Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, whilst the first game is considered to have a good story but Starkiller being really overpowered, you have the second installment of the game which really lacked in quality causing Disney to pull not only the production but also the canon-plug. What i want to say is that it is really hard to create a good Star Wars story an this game certainly nailed it. You get to meet characters you know and love as it plays some time after the sixth movie. Looking at the plot retroactively you could even think that it is all canon even with the seventh movie already being out. Even though i don't know if it actually is still considered canon.   Now you're probably asking yourself how well does it run?    System Compatibilty: Which is actually pretty interesting. Since the Jedi Knight II is on Steam you threrefore shouldn't have any sytem issues but there a some things that need a manual fixing. The game comes with some wonky unusual resolution settings that noone uses anymore but you i guess we have to cut the game some slack since as i said earlier it came out in 2003. These can be adjusted through a autoexec file which can easily be created and packed with commands. On my machine the game gives my PC a spastic shock when i try to minimize it fullscreen but that could be only my issue.   I hope atleast one of you sat through my whole review and decides to give this amazing game a try after reading through that mess of fandom babbling. Wish you the best time playing and ..... Force ...... you!",

            "review_text": "A classic, is amongst my favorite games. The game has amazing lightsaber combat, some of the best sword style combat on any platform.  Jedi Outcast has great shooting mechanics as well as easy access Force powers. Being the game came out in 2003, it takes influence from many sources. It contains elements of influence from the matrix, force jump allows you to run up walls, and force speed slows all projectiles around you. The game even has the unreal Flak Cannon (called the flechette gun).   The game has an interesting online community with more than just your standard death match fare. It has a different rule set with players often taking time to duel rather than straight openly murder each other (Though some servers have different rules and contain straight death match)  It's worth taking note you can turn off your lightsaber with the 1 button, often players find the saber turned state as you being hostile.  For the cheap price of 10 bucks this game is worth it, I've spent easily over 400 hours on it. (Not the steam version but when I owned the disc)",

It's not just shooting and slashing with lightsaber ( there is a lot of that though ) but you have to think and solve some puzzles to finish the levels. This is probably the best Star Wars game I have ever played. while KOTOR was great too, it wasn't quite enjoyable as this one, this is a faster game with more dynamics.",

Complete with blocks, combos, parries and lightsabre duels, Outcast is the definitive lightsabre experience in the very long history of Star Wars titles.  Surprisingly, the game is equally good. With a very engaging single player campaign, not to mention riotously fun multiplay, this deserves to be in the collection of every gamer who ever called themselves a Star Wars fan.",

Recommend this to Star Wars fans who are up for an adventure. After going through a few puzzling missions, you'll eventually gain force powers and a lightsaber. I'm not going to go any further (spoilers). But the lightsaber battles are great and you will actually use other weapons, so ya don't have to stick with a lightsaber. You can clear enemies in your path with the force (lightning) and throw enemies of edges using force (grip). And you can swap between 1st and 3rd person(s) wielding any weapon.  Great game for Star Wars fans interested in the Expanded Universe. ",

            "review_text": "The adventures of everyone’s favorite Kyle Katarn continue in another thrilling Jedi Knight game. And who doesn’t love Kyle anyways? He’s often been referred to as the Chuck Norris of Star Wars. And to people that care about Chuck Norris that probably means something. For me personally, Kyle as seen in these games is more annoying that the Kyle you read about in many of the books.  But I’m not reviewing the latest Fate of the Jedi book, is that series still popular? I’m way behind on my Star Wars novels unfortunately. We’re here to talk about the next in the Jedi Knight series, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. This time Kyle is back, and what starts with a blue milk run quickly becomes a quest fueled by anger and revenge.  As the Wikipedia blurb said, assuming anybody actually reads those, Jedi Outcast uses the Quake III: Team Area engine. This means we are guaranteed to have a pretty good looking game, ID Tech III was first seen in Quake III Arena back in 1999. It was a beautiful game then, and personally is still a beautiful game. While there will always be things that could be picked at about the engine, and all the games that run on it, it will remain in my book as one of the best looking engines out there.  Jedi Outcast starts off kinda slow, but does pick up its pace once you get your hands on your lightsaber. Which for me took about 4 hours. I’m not going to lie, I had a really tough time with this game for some reason. I’ve played it through in the past, but long enough ago that everything was still new to me. In fact it wasn’t until I got the lightsaber that I realized that I had in fact play Jedi Outcast.  Something about the combat mechanics didn’t agree with me, and while there were some valid complaints. Things like the Imperial Officers take more damage than the Stormtroopers. Stormtroopers that are wearing armor while the Officers simply have their dress uniforms. It would appear that a cotton polyester blend can withstand blaster fire better than the standard issue plastoid armor. Someone should tell Requisitions about this, could save the Empire billions of credits.  You know that line from A New Hope? Where Ben Kenobi says that a lightsaber isn’t as clumsy or random as a blaster. Thereby implying that blasters are both clumsy and random. Well it seems like the developers took that line from the movie and placed it at the core of their combat mechanics. You could fire a blaster six times without moving the mouse and you’ll hit at six different locations. The blasters have a fan effect, one that is made worse if you use the rapid-fire.  While the previous games had a similar fanning of the blaster bolts, they also had an auto-aim that counter balanced it. You didn’t have to be a perfect shot, the blaster would make up for what you lacked in skill. Here they’ve done away with the auto-aim, but left the fanning. Personally, I don’t think Ben was being very literal when he made that statement. Not to the extent that this game makes it seem.  The story I’d call above average, but still falls to some standard video game issues. As with many games there are aspects or parts of the story that feel like they are only there for something to do. Otherwise, were it simply a written story, the segment would have been left out. But I’d can’t blame a game for these moments, as all games tend to have them. The developers want to keep the action up, or to showcase a specific feature or ability in the game, and write a level into the story just for that purpose. Its a common trait, and one that we games have gotten used to. And the better writers and developers can do this, and blend it into the story so well that we tend to not even notice it on the first pass.  Jedi Outcast has the expected character cameos of Luke Skywalker, Mon Mothma, Jan Ors, and Lando Calrissian. And best of all is that Billy Dee Williams actually voiced Lando, giving the character a little more love than the others. Although it was a pretty big coincidence that Kyle should happen to be stranded in the same place where Lando is locked up.  But convenient coincidences aside, the story holds it own with the average of today. As well as the bulk of the gameplay, controls, and puzzles have all aged well. The blasters could use a little work, and perhaps a texture update and you have something that beats a lot of today’s releases. In fact this would be a great game to get a HD remake. And there are probably a couple of other things that I just can’t think of right now, but I guess they’re not that important.",

This is the game in which you get to hang out with Lando Calrissian on the Millennium Falcon. It's also the game where you drive an AT-ST in a jungle and then get taunted by a dark Jedi with a deep voice in a temple while the throne room theme from Return of the Jedi plays.  It's a very 'Star Wars' experience - its attempts to summon nostalgia for the movies succeed much more than in its predecessors Dark Forces and Jedi Knight, or its sequel Jedi Academy. All of those are quality games in their own right, but Jedi Outcast has Lando in it. It feels effortless.  Outcast is far from perfect - its visuals and choppy lightsaber combat have aged poorly even if its blaster-blasting is still fun. Its plot, for all its Star Wars-y-ness and syruppy nostalgia, is pretty silly (a dinosaur is involved). The nineties/noughties obligatory stealth section and needless keycard hunts are a bit of a pain. But I will be god damned if Lando Calrission isn't right there sat next to you with Billy Dee Williams doing the voice and everything.  A fun adventure that gets its tone just right, while the gameplay varies. Recommended easily for fans of the films (Lando cameos btw), but for people who are after a quality shooter/platformer by modern standards, it's just a blue milk run.",

The story was interesting with a lot of familiar faces, which was exciting, the music is typical Star Wars, meaning it's good, and it's just a lot of fun to feel like an empowered bada$$ Jedi Knight. There are a slew of force powers to use on your enemies including the iconic Force Choke (called Force Grip here), Force Jump, Force Push, Force Pull, and even Force Lightning. Yeah. The lightsaber duels are also quite impressive visually, and employ an interesting mechanic that few other games incorporate. Lightsabers do a LOT of damage. A direct hit is a one-hit kill for most enemies. Some of the more powerful ones take a few more hits. That applies to your character too though. One good hit can be the difference between life and death, especially on the harder difficulties, and it gives the lightsaber combat a very frantic feel. The best thing I can really compare it to is Nidhogg, except 3d and you aren't fighting over territory. That being said the lightsaber duels can also drag on for a long period of time, and it's really, in my opinion, as often tedious as it is fun. This franchise started off as a first person shooter, but over time became more and more focused on lightsaber combat and force powers. If you played dark forces or the original Jedi Knight, you may be dissappointed with the direction this game has taken. The lightsaber and force powers have been significantly upgraded from the original Jedi Knight and completely overshadowed the shooting mechanics. The 1st person shooter mechanics are solid, but completely unnecessary. As a matter of fact it's quite likely you'll spend the whole game using your lightsaber after obtaining it and never use a blaster again. You DO have to reach a certain point in the story to unlock your lightsaber and force powers. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game.",

Now you may be asking your self... Do i really want to play this game sense it really makes you think.... yes... yes you do this game does not only have an awesome story but also a big community in guides and some awesome CC that you can use to make the game easier right from the begenning and soooo much more fun... specially the CC for mutilation... I always wanted to slice some storm troopers in 10 peices... or litearly in half lol... oops one ran their neck right into my light saber... head falls off... Luke accidentally jump on my light saber head first... had to start mission over lololol... oooh nooo storm trooper incoming.... passes right through my light saber im guessin he wont be needing those two arms... or legs... lololol.   Anyways great game, buy both JA and JO, play it JA first then JO. Both Game go for 10$ trust me money well spent, dont trust those people who say wait for it to go in sale... JA you will play over and over and over again... Been playing them sense they came out in XBOX lol.   Game Play 9: I hate using guns in a Jedi game... Theirs a way around it to use a saber from the begenning (google) ;P Puzzles: 10: frustrating but rewarding Sound 10: pew pew pew, pshhhhh slicing.... Story 10: me against the whole Empire......... I still outnumber them =)) Play it again 8: Jedi Academy takes the cake sorry lol ",

            "review_text": "   Disclaimer :  I got this game for almost nothing in some Star Wars Humble Bundle that i bought for other games a few year back, that's why i'm considering i got the game for free (probably for less than 0.25€)  I hadn't played this game for more than 10 years... A friend lent me the game back then, but i never finished it. When i noticed it in my Steam library this week-end so i decided to give it another try.   The game is a blend of FPS and third person lightsaber combat. Weapons feel responsive, sound great, and carry the nostalgia of these early-2000s Star Wars games. The graphics are not bad, they aged well in my opinion and i'm genuinely still amazed by the marks left by lightsabers on walls.  Now for the cons :  * First it's clearly not worth 10€ in 2016.  * Some game mechanics are NOT introduced, i discovered that i could use objects, after being stuck for half an hour in the only part of the game that really require using them (The nightvision goggles in the hangar level). Moreover, i only discovered during the final level that i could heal myself using a force power. (Explaining why the last levels were so hard, since medipacs were not provided anymore as i was supposed to use the force...)   * Talking about levels, they seem well designed at first glance, but they are a labyrinthic mess. Prepare to run around levels you just cleared for hours before finding out an utterly hidden ventilation grid on the ceiling of a random room that will lead to the next part of it. This happens in every level and i wasn't prepared for that. I still can't believe some levels of this game made it through QA and play-testing, as half of them require you to perform jumps that would have been considered as glitch/skips in any decently-designed game.  TL;DR : This is overall a good experience, but kinda frustrating if you are used to modern games that have corrected the youthful errors of this one over a decade.  6.5/10 ",
