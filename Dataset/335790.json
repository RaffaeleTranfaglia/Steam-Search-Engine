            "review_text": "I don't like giving 'not recommended' reviews, but technically this game has the complexity of 'TRIGGER KNIGHT' from Kongregate, except you have to type in words to do damage instead of pressing a simple button. Considering how quickly enemies attack and how often you die to give it a roguelike-but-heroprogression feel (unless you look up the anagrams on the internet in the background), typing random words hopefully 3-4-5 letters long that you hope are on the grid is the way to go. After 4 hours, I don't really want to return to it. But I did get 2 EUR worth of time out of it, I guess. I don't like the time limits on the anagram system though, who the hell thinks of words like ICARIAN, JAMDANI, APOCOPE or NONYLIC? (or my favorite that the anagram finders didn't know - SAGATHY) And if you don't, your character is dead. Didn't like that mechanic, because I'm bad at it, and it just feels unreasonable.  The problem with the game is how the letters are not organized in any reasonable shape or form on the grid, so finding words really just comes down to typing in random permutations of letters you see quickly and hope the game accepts it.  You can buy it, it's interesting at first, but it's a one-trick pony. If you want a one-trick pony that's a bit more versatile, go for either Trigger Knight, or Puzzle Quest.",

If you kill the Boss of an area you can go to the next area and fight new monsters, during your journey you will level up, add new heros to your party, buy equipment and potions, but none of this seems to be really important. I enjoyed the game and will probably continue playing until i unlock every character but this is not a game for everyone.   It is repetitive and using a lot of 3 or 4 letter words is a strategy that works throughout the whole game. I wish there was a little bit more depth to it. While the heros seems different enough, the mechanics and enemies are not. There is a lot of room for improvement because every enemy feels samey, sure they maybe have different stats but you don't have to mix it up to beat them. Other games of this genre often times use special conditions for fights, for example enemies that are immune to short words or enemies that remove some of your letters the longer a fight goes. The game also doesn't have a full screen mode...",

We looted many chests, at least as many as we could, many had locks I found nigh on unfathomable, one I opened with humor. On this noble quest of mine, I traveled many miles, finding new allies as I lost the old ones in combat, they fought valiantly and they will be missed. Nonetheless we met our end, bested by a giant fungus, it's strength unimaginable, against it my defense was untenable. It was a long bloody battle, the creature suffered many wounds before I finally succumbed to mine, and as I stared up at it it's beady eyes peering down at me sprawled across the cold muddy earth I spoke my final words before it stuck the finishing blow. I looked up at it and through gritted teeth I uttered muttered the one word I could think of to deal what damage I could to this foe before I perished. Through bated breath I looked up at the mushroom, my bitter resentment unable to be hid and simply whispered...  ' s e m e n '  10/10 would play again.",

            "review_text": "I really like this game. Recently i've been playing heaps of online scrabble and when i stumbled across Words for Evil i thought it sounded interesting and unique, plus the art is really nostalgic of a lot of older games with pretty simple and repeditive adventuring style gameplay. So in saying that, it definetly is interesting and unique. I haven't played a game like this before. The adventuring style is basically constant sidescroll running across (what seems to be) a totally randomised landscape with different kinds of actions available that you interact with using words. There's monster battles, traps, treasure chests you unlock, blacksmith, potion man, a healing well, and new party members to be found (including santa) The music and sounds are also pretty nice and relaxing. HOWEVER- one thing i do not like about this game and keeps causing me to close it in anger is the obscurity of the words sometimes used, (that you have to unscramble to make an anagram and save yourself for example). I can understand having trickier words for more dire situations but it kind of feels like the people who made this game just found an online dictionary and added the whole lot into the game, including some of the most unfair words no one would really know unless you were specifically looking up the names of certain dog muscles or what the leader of a remote african tribe is called etc.  If the game was a bit less challenging i would definetly say to keep the complex words in, because who likes it when it's not a challenge right? Monster battles would be pretty easy to anybody, you just need to include the 'special' letters to do attacks, and that means 3 letter words are OK. However sometimes because of the randomising of encounters, you really need to get into a chest to save yourself because a well just does not seem to be coming around anytime soon, and you can only carry 3 potions maximum.  Also another problem i find is that i can't understand the weapons/armour system. there is no way to tell what weapon you are weilding and im not sure if your weapons replace when you buy them or just add to your attk stat. there is also no way at all to check your armour rating apparently.  So all in all, i would say i reccomend this game to friends because it's simple, can be pretty relaxing, and fun to play when you dont have much time to commit. Just make sure you change the difficult to Zen if you're prone to frustration easily or dont have an extensive vocabulary. I also hope the developers fix the armor and weapon issue soon.",

            "review_text": "Ever since this game popped up on the main shop front page as a new game, I was curious. I love word games. Words for Evil did not disappoint at all.  It's a walker type game, and you can quit out anytime from the level and keep the progress you've made. You make your own party out of a number of unlockable heroes, including Santa Claus (who is seriously impressive in a fight)! Essentially you're given one of a number of puzzles, depending on whether you are up against a monster, a chest, or a trap, and you have to do your best at figuring them out. It stimulates the mind, and there are RPG elements as well, such as levelling up and buying gear.  I set it on the Zen difficulty and I still find it stimulating and challenging. It's the kind of game that sucks you in and, before you know it, hours have passed. It's so easy to say 'I'll just go to the next fountain' or 'I just want to do a few more battles'.  The graphics are adorable and charming, as well as in some cases quite stunning. The sense of humour in the game is welcome and pleasant. It's also noteworthy that it has a mode for those who may be colour blind or have a deficiency in distinguishing colours, so that's a really important thing.  It's a light game that doesn't take up a lot of space or demand masses of processing power, so it's the perfect game for any system. Some words you'd expect or know may not be in the game's dictionary, but that can just add a little to the challenge. Either way, it's been perfectly delightful for me, and I have no problem recommending it to anyone who likes to think as they play a game.  Charming, fun, and really absorbing, Words for Evil also has a price that can fit into most any budget. It's worth picking up and supporting. I'd love to see more games like this, and I look forward to seeing what the developer does with Words of Evil in future. ",

This will be a nice change from the usual. The characters and art are simple, but consistently nice, while the designs and worlds are quite varied. There are Shops (potions and armor), Treasure Chests, Traps, Healing Springs (and medicine makers who heal for a fee), run-ins with new potential party members, mysterious otherworldly callings... Aside from weak to strong enemy encounters, a great number of things can happen each time you press on, created by a random generator. I've personally found about 6 hours of unique content so far, though I've never finished a journey or completed the character/enemy index.  There are also lots of different ways the game executes its status as a word game. For instance, if death comes for any of your characters, they have one last chance to fight back - Just solve a difficult anagram for one of two effects: a full solve for healed revival, and a partial solve for a last resort counter-attack (I've never gotten the full solve...).   You can also start a new game with characters you've leveled up in previous runs. (Personal faves are Frost Wizard, River Spirit, and Pope IX. Storm Jarl gets honorable mention.)
