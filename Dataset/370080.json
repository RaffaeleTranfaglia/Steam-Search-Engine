There is a somewhat lack of options and in order to change resolutions you must restart the game. Your required to select a resolution size prior to launching the game. This is somewhat annoying. Considering if you don't like the selected resolution you must restart. Game interface and the level joining relatively easy no complaints. Game just needs better options.",
