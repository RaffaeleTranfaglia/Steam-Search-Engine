Also trying to min-max schedule in a limited 30-days timeframe gives moderate challenge and pressure, which is always a good thing. I think a casual gamer would easily top 15+ hours of gameplay from this.  One minor con factor are endings. I've checked 4 endings (harem ending not included, and they are all abrupt, short and not quite believable. One character's ending was merely a few lines of text that had next to 0 implications of characters' future. If you put high value to endings in dating genre, don't buy this game (or at least wait for 50% sale).",

Pretty addictive game though it isn't that complex (leave me alone I'm a SIMMER)  Positive : 1. Neat and User Friendly UI 2. Music 3. VC (it's not the best but considering the indie studio) 4. CORNELIA (this is very crucial point to the game, love her she get you paid last)  Negative : 1. Still has bugs which has to be adressed further (it'll be addressed soon)  Decent : 1. Dialogues 2. I don't understand all the joke.  VERDICT 8.5/10 Recommended Hybrid",

            "review_text": "Barely Recommended I very much enjoyed the visual novel parts of the game, including having certain events tied to certain locations and heroines. As far is a time limited visual novel where you need to raise stats to a certain level by the “end game” to not fail this would be average to above average title (B+). I found the characters, story, art, and voice acting all very enjoyable.   However, progression to success is locked behind a stat wall that could be hard to overcome. There are battle stats, money, and relationships in the game. To beat the game you need to hit non-specific thresholds for all of these. Relationships open new battle skills. Money can be used to build relationships (gift buying) or direct combat power (weapons armor).   So here is the biggest negative for me. I've save scummed more for this game than any other game I've played in the last 5 years because of failing relationship quests and combats.    Why? Relationship quests are tied to a girl, location, and sometimes an item. To complete a quest you may need a certain girl to go to a certain zone – it she doesn’t before the quest expires you fail and lose affection. Sometimes the quest is to kill XXX of some monster or collect a mob drop. Once again this is random. This means the simplest way to raise affection is to simply feed your chosen girl(s) gifts. This is boring and suffers from a poor UI, which will have you sitting in an inventory screen and reading the same “thanks for the gift” text way longer than could ever be enjoyable.    Second grievance: Combat that you aren’t prepared for can be unbeatable, and if you die you must load your last save. So save often. If you find yourself outclassed and need more money to buy better equipment your only choice is to buy “repellant” and earn money at 50% rate (which means you’ll likely never catch up to monsters level as they get harder with time). Before I got into the habit of saving before every random encounter I was about to quit the game and refund it.   To help ease the money grind (I assume) there is a special (random) item drop from mobs that sells for more money than you would ever earn by farming monsters. The item I am talking about can be given to ONE girl to raise her ONE relationship level, or you can sell it for so much money you can probably max out 2-3 girls with gifts, this just forces the player to grind the through the UI pointlessly.",

            "review_text": "This is a game that has left me very conflicted on whether or not I can recommend this game at all as there are some things that are fairly good and other aspects that are not so good. I don't expect myself to write a very long review of Just Deserts since I normaly don't play Visual Novels very often and I apparently have very bad tastes for them as well. First off, the voice acting is pretty good, especially the fact that they went as far as to give them accents for their respective nationalities. What's a bit awkward is that the voice acting sometimes does not match the text on the screen along with one or two instances where the audio bugs out a bit. For whatever reason, everytime your player name is included in the character's speech, they just stay silent and never talk in a way that they can say the same thing making the conversation feel a bit awkward, but it's possible to talk in a way where they don't have to address the player name to keep the natural flow of their speech, but they never did so there's that.  If you're expecting a deep story behind the alien attacks, you're not gonna get it since the story is just 'aliens are invading Earth, don't bother asking any questions and just go exterminate them'. With aliens in the picture, there is the combat system to go along with it, but unfortunately the combat in the game is a huge deal breaker for some people because the combat system is extremely basic, flawed, and just plain boring that feels like unnecessary padding, especially the fact that you cannot skip the combat animations and text that constanly pops up every time an action takes place. Getting equipment is outrageously overpriced compared to how much money you earn which is especially problematic in the early game where you only have a pistol and a knife, plus it's completely reliant on RNG in addition to the enemy always having the advantage over you. In fact, most of the equipment available for purchase is completely useless and a waste of money with the only weapons you will find yourself using the majority of the time is the RPG, the shotgun, the smg, and occasionally the knife for cutting though shields. During combat, you can call out for support from any of the heroines you've brought with you during your patrols, but the way it was built makes money even more of an issue since calling in support of any description will siphon a huge sum of cash out of your bank account for whatever reason. There also appears to have an initiative system for whomever has the higher speed stats gets to go first and the game does not give you any information on the enemy's statistics whatsoever other than a generic health bar so there's more RNG on top of your RNG. Lastly, the aliens themselves are not very interesting to look at because they're all just elemental polygons.  There are quests you can partake in to increase your relationship status with the other heroines, but at least half of them is completely dependant on RNG while the other half is to empty your wallets on overpriced tat like say Cornelia asks you to kill X number of X-type aliens, but you could do nothing but patrols for 3 days straight and never reach the amount of kills needed to complete the quest all because X-type aliens never spawned or don't spawn enough to get there.  At the end of the day, Just Deserts is not a bad game per say. It's a light-hearted story with light-hearted characters that apparently goes down a more serious tone when you get to know them I suppose, but then again, the tone of the writing was never consistent to begin with. There's an alien invasion, yet most of the time everything else that happens around you makes you completely forget that there is an invasion in the first place. There are multiple endings, but then you end up asking yourself if you want to deal with the monotonous combat system for several more hours just to see a different variation of the the same ending. I have no idea. Perhaps it depends on how you personaly feel about your first playthough, but if I had to describe all of the mechanics of this game in just a few words, it would be one of those games that has RNG built on top of RNG times seven. To recommend or to not recommend? That is the question I ask myself everyday when it comes down to personal enjoyment vs overall quality. If you can tolerate the questionable mechanics of Just Deserts and enjoy a light-hearted story to boot, then Just Deserts could be for you. Otherwise, I regrettably suggest you look elsewhere for something that's less frustrating to go through.",
