            "review_text": "#Edited for the first launch day#  Having played this game for 50+ hours under different conditions, difficulties and scenarious, along with getting the very first A+ score, I can safely say the following: get it. It is a 3D Faster Than Light + a few more games mixed in it (most notably Star Trek Bridge Commander) + Ironman experience. It is there to test the fans of the rogue-like hardcore genre who do not complain about losing stuff or people, getting destroyed, then learning and adapting as a result. There is no save and load function. You roll the roulette and you live with what you've gotten in a beautiful 3d FTL-Star Trek format.  FOREWORD: If someone says that the game has no replay value, they have played it way too little. Look at my play time. I rarely did the same run twice, unless trying to beat my previous score or testing new stuff.  The game is out of early access as of today, the 04.03.2015. Sadly, it already received a number of negative reviews during the years of development, so you will be looking at mixed reviews for a while. Most of it was because the devs were trying to find the reasons for the game not launching for a number of people, and those were readily cranking out the negative reviews. FYI, before I start with the good and the bad.  As usual, I will start with the good and the bad.  The absolute BEST:  The game generates meaningful stories through its gameplay, the type that make you take to the forums and share, be it for a win or a loss. How you had a great playthrough until everything started falling apart, people started dying, enemies were swarming you in throves and eventually destroyed you. Or how everything was so bleak, you were out of resources but managed to find a solitary planet where you safely did 6+ probe runs, restocked like crazy and won the game? Or how you went all out berserk and punched your way through the enemy lines like a boss? Or how a single rash decision on an away mission lost you two of your most valuable crew members and it all went downhill OR you still won nevertheless? Yep, all of this is possible. I absolutely love this about a game.  The Good: 1. Beautiful backdrops - the space, the planets and the suns look beautiful. The space must be black by default, but you are playing a game right? 2. The ship is also a looker. I personally love the way it appears on my screen with all of its flashing blue red and metal stuff. Once you start building structures, they will also appear inside it, which adds a new level of immersion. 3. Resource Management - picking what you want, what you need, when you need it might be the difference between defeat and a victory. Shortages really punish you, and even if you win, it affects your score big time. 4. You get to pick your ship parts - this allows for huge customization. You may pick a nimble ship with fewer systems but tons of cargo space, or you can make yourself a juggernaut. with less storage space and better weapons, absorption, shuttle missions, etc. All up to you. 5. Last ditch effort - this type of play really reels you in as you see the last 10 000 people of the human race die from lack of food, oxygen, killed by enemies and random events. Speaking about random events... 6. Random events are either detrimental (e.g. Alien Flu) or beneficial (Training for crewmembers). This forces you to deal with situations even more strategically, because while fighting, people still die. 7. Ironman - no going back. I love this type of play for certain games and this one is certainly worth it, just like FTL. 8. You have a decent grid size and you need to pick your way through it till you reach the end goal, dealing with hostile encounters, resource shortages, planet and object exploration, etc. 9. The combat - in FTL the combat was minimalistic. Shoot something and it will either hit or miss. Here, you need to think on your feet, use different coloured weapons and shield harmonics, defend and fire when necessary, evade shots, pause, think, and do your best. If you wish you can opt to play completely without pausing - that makes the combat extremely dynamic, but you will most likely suffer way more hits. 10. Strategy wins the game - trust me, I felt that. Making rash decisions isn't the best thing. You really need to accept the position you are in and adapt to it. Playing to the strengths of your ship and crew is key. 11. Renaming crewmembers - are you a Star Trek, Star Wars, Farscape or another franchise's fan? Or you like to use the names of your closest friends or family members? You can! 12. Like FTL, there are multiple ways to victory - at present, I would split them into sneaky, semi-sneaky, bold and reckless types of wins. 13. The game lets you do stuff on the fly. You just need to learn the mechanics. I am not going to spoil those for you. 14. Runs vary. A faster engine will get you to the end goal quicker, but a battle-hardened combat crew getting you trough 1 vs 3 encounters is a joy to behold. 15. Flying through gorgeous space. If you dont like it, it is simply not your jam. 16. Play-throughs take about 2 hours, which I find good for these types of games. 17. Scoring system that allows you to check how well you did in comparison to the others. 18. Many new features added since EA - 3 difficulty settings, ship setups, civilian management, more away missions, etc. 19. Replayability has been improved a lot since alpha, so you will be looking at a lot of different runs. While the end goal is the same, just like FTL, nobody forces you to reach it - a full exploration run (mine was the first full exploration run to date) takes about 8 hours.  Ok. Here's THE BAD.  The ABSOLUTE WORST:  You will ragequit if you hate games that punish you. Many a time. Get used to it, or don't buy the game.  To continue...  1. Steep learning curve - you need to play with ship setups for a while, learn how they work, what resources to pick at start, how long to stay at a planet, which awaymissions are easier and which ones harder, and so on. 2. NO multiplayer, like FTL. Can't be fixed. 3. Some bugs are still present, but the devs are all over the community forum, listening to the people and taking notes. Always good to see. 4. Combat - while I praised it, one can still find it minimalistic. 5. Punishing away missions since alpha. While the death to success ratio has been curbed a bit, and more choices given to the player, one should still exercise extreme caution when taking on away missions.. 6. Some players still can't launch the game. Best check the forums before buying this game. The devs are hard at work at it.  CONCLUSION:  The game is quite the looker, and has this FTL last ditch type of feeling. Up until now, the devs have been on the money with the updates, consistently adding more content - with the last patch enabling us to manage the civilian population by adding more buildings, with the option to upgrade them in the future to avoid the constant civilian problems. Whoever says this game is short... is right, but it can also be played is a plethora of ways, adding replayability. Fastest way to goal, explore the whole quadrant, go left side, go right side, be sneaky, fight a lot, try not to fight at all. Or plain handicap yourself if U R A PRO. Just try it! I know I did, with runs with as low as 575 credits. To me, this game is one huge sandbox - I get to pick my difficulty (and by that I don't mean the pre-set ones), my setup, my way to play the game and try to win. It is fun - whether you should choose to challenge yourself or just explore the vast quardant of space and enjoy the extremely atmospheric Into the Stars.",

            "review_text": "Keep in mind most of the other (negative) reviews are from early access.  Anyway, I'd give this game a buy with a caveat. If you, like me, are always searching for starship sims (less Tie Fighter more Star Trek Bridge Commander), you might enjoy this game. If you aren't, however, you probably will not like this, as it is a fairly simple, shallow experience. That experience, however, does scratch that utterly maddening starship sim itch.  This game allows you to play like you're Captain Picard or Admiral Adama, which is something a lot of us really want, but not something that's often made. Most of the games in this genre are decades old, rarely talked about or even remembered, and sometimes not even capable of being played on modern machines -- even with DosBox. This game fills that very large gap. If you are looking to sit on the bridge and take command over starship systems and crew, this is for you.  So what is the game like? It basically amounts to a series of simple mobile-like minigames superimposed over a smallish 3d open world and resource management simulator. You can pick and name your captain, crew, ship loadout (everything from weapons systems to what kind of food replicators you ship is equipped with), and starting resources. The controls are not able to be changed, but they are fine as-is and not anything that you'd worry about changing anyway. For that matter the interface is streamlined and easy to use. The mini-games are actually enjoyable, if simplistic, so the game ends up being pretty fun for the price.   The only things I dislike about the game are its lack of depth (the minigames really do feel like minigames and the away missions are just randomly generated die rolls with possible stat bonuses applied as far as I can tell) and its visual style (some may like it, but I find it a hideous mess that's aesthetically similar to the worst of bargain-bin scifi crap--lots of glowing neon, random hexes getting in the way of everything, plastic-looking textures, hideous ship design, etc). These may be deal breakers for some, but I'm willing to put up with it because A) It's cheap and B) it exists in a genre that's very rarely explored.   tl;dr It's a simpler FTL in first person, except you feel more attached to your crew and ship",

            "review_text": "I've just finished my first walkthrough and the game definitely gave the Battlestar Galactica / FTL feeling, especially in the very end where my ship had only 3HP left, all oxygen and fuel just gone as I entered into the last sector, my crew and civilians started to suffocate and the ship basically was dead, drifted into the finish line, to Titus Nova in the very last moment.  But the journey wasn't uneventful either. On the very first away mission I lost my pilot immediately due to surface radiation. So I needed to find a replacement for her. Around the middle of the game finally I had an elite pilot with a skill of 99, who, surprise, surprise, was eaten by some sort of seemingly peaceful alien during one of the away missions. After that I needed to find another replacement pilot who should control the mining rig as I was short on supplies. Of course the rookie pilot (Who was by the way a veteran commander with a stat of 75+) accidentaly crashed with my elite miner onboard, killing both of them on the very next day. So basically even my elite main characters acted like red shirts, and lost three officers within two days. And the game is cruel, as you definitely feel the loss of your experienced crew. So for the rest of the journey I needed to use my rookie officers to somehow survive and reach Titus Nova, and make them to worthy officers. In the end the four remaining officers became a pretty veteran crew.  While the Early Access was very-very unbalanced, for the final release the game has a really enjoyable balance. So thank you for this great game. My only problem is that some of the achievements didn't unlock, regardless I did them. But beyond that, the game has a fantastic atmosphere where you truly need to watch for many things to survive and you really have to consider what your next step should be.  So thank you! And whoever liked Battlestar Galactica and FTL, give this game a try. You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "When I reviewed this game it was quite a bit different. I like a lot of the changes they have made with being able to actually have small interactions with the civilians on the ship and able to impact their growth more directly. The combat is also a lot better now that you're not guaranteed to be destroyed in combat. I also like how they simplified your ship options and you no longer have to pick your rations which was incredibly difficult to figure out the proper proportions. This game is definitely moving in the correct direction. I know I was incredibly late on rereviewing this game but I had issues with steam allowing the game to launch, probably a problem on my end. It's far from perfect but it's making strives in the correct direction which is good enough for me.",

While the visuals were good and overall mechanics solid, there was a definitive lack of action diversity in the game. What I mean by this is that it felt almost like an enhanced clicker game with how I kept repeating the same actions over and over. Ultimatly, there was not a great deal to do despite the games outward large-sized scope.   It could use a good dozen additional components and mechanics to give it a better run. For example it should have more frequent encounters with NPC ships that offer more options beside mere trade. Additional options upon reaching a planet would have been appreciated as well.  Good marks on effort - ultimatly lacking on its delivery. Not recomended.",
