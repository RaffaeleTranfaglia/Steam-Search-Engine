I was also able to play it with gamepad, which was a little bit tricky at the beginning but when you find out which button is which and how to handle the user interface it's easy to play. There are two modes available, Fractions and classic risk, you can also turn off detailed war scenes and play it like classic risk with only dice roll. I didnt go further and try other features, I liked it so far.",

            "review_text": "I personally enjoy this game on a scale of 7.5/10 . I say this because I played the board game; and what is RISK Factions but RISK with animations, automated setups (Rather helpful), and if you have a laptop you can carry this as well as other games around. But why did I take off the other 3.5? Well one pro about it being electronic is the AI, but after a while the AI becomes predictable (Such as going back for their capital at all costs), but the one major con I have with this game that is unless you're playing hotseat (but if you have actual RISK you can play it, just there is no animations, however either way there is problems with both, such as the board getting shook or water spilling) or a have a few willing friends is that multiplayer is basically a useless feature. The one way I've seen Multiplayer used to it's capibilaty is over state lines or even overseas. Well all in all, either way the way this game could grow in a major way is either fixing some of its bugs, or extending the campaign and give it more of a story, or somehow by improving Multiplayer. Well I still like the game. Well, if you like RISK, try the game, if not then either way you should give it a shot, Steam gives refunds ya know. Well again. I still like the game besides all its flaws and I still reccomend giving it a shot.",

It was a better game in every way. AND it's 10 years older... Risk Factions is a waste of money.",

I don't know if the game is broken or what going on but the AI seem to control luck.  also no one uses multiplayer  despite the game advertisting each character having different abilitys I've yet to see it... and have no idea what the abilities are because there is no way find so in the game....  Positive: I like the added characters, it's rewarding to conquer the world as a cat dictator  The added cities,capitals extra create a put a new twist on risk   overall I'm still not sure about this game... it's extrmely addictive at times while frustrating at other times... it's still better then playing risk with online websites that often take hours to find a match.",

            "review_text": "This game is so bad. Better said, this game has one of the worst rng factors I've ever stumbled across. Yeah I know, happens in real life risk too, but no one plays the game online anymore, so you'll only have the AI to play against. And this is where the ridiculous rng happens. Ever lost with 15 units against 1 pc unit rolling 10x 6 in a row? Yeah that's fun! Another example: I just lost a game because of only getting 1 card set done (right in the beginning for 6 units) the three AI enemies could each complete a card set every three turns two times in a row. It ended with me having 4 countries 3 units each against AI opponents each controlling a continent. But they didn't decide to weaken each other to deny their continent bonuses, but somehow they decided to crush themselves in North America. In the end I managed to conquer South America and then suddenly they decided to deny my bonuses.  TL;DR: Everytime you get realistic chances at winning the game, all AI opponents will leap on you together. When done, they will continue doing their thing. + bad rng dice rolls  If some of you are interested in my rolls:  1: 854 2: 849 3: 827 4: 803 5: 826 6: 769  1:6 deviation: +9%, 2:5 deviation: -10%, 3:4 deviation: -10,3% After this amount of rolls it should start to get to zero deviation, but no.",

At this price, I feel this game is very much worth it. However, I feel at the cost of $9.99, the game is overpriced. It provides interesting gameplay that is fun with friends, however the AI in the game could use some balancing. EX: Battles are often favored towards the AI, and the AI usually chooses to attack you and not other AI. The concept itself is great, but more develop and more effor would make this game much better.",
