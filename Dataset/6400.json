            "review_text": "I love this game. It's still kind of topical, but I don't play it for the politics. The graphics are nice, the missions are fun, and there's a lot of replayability because if something doesn't work, back up a little and try a different approach. Sometimes the AI is a bit wonky, especially when in vehicles, but overall the controls are smooth and intuitive. I like that you have to pay attention to how much money you have and that you can't rely on just endlessly churning out or requisitioining equipment, supplies, and soldiers.. It makes you play smart with what you have.",

            "review_text": "Lots of potential buried under poor design decisions. I remember when this first came out way back when, I was really excited for it and then incredibly disappointed by the ending. That feeling more or less holds up now - the first couple of missions are great, with a cool 'international peacekeepers' concept that's pretty unique, but then the story very quickly departs from that and becomes a convoluted mess that never makes any sense and ends on a sequel hook cliffhanger with no real explanation of anything that's going on. The game was a bomb and a sequel never got made, so the story ends up feeling like complete nonsense. It feels like the game went through several rewrites and the different plots ended up being sloppily patched together to make missions fit in the end.   Speaking of missions, they become unbearably boring and articifially difficult about halfway through, making the game an overlong slog that's absolutely full of padding. The unit variety makes tic-tac-toe seem deep, with every unit in the game introduced within the first few missions, and the AI spamming forces of roughly 80% anti-aircraft units in the late game in order to render all of your air support completely useless (and thereby upping the difficulty considerably, since not only do you effectively lose air support, but the enemy's AA is also great anti-infantry and decent anti-armor.) This is made even worse by the terrible AI - poor pathfinding is more or less expected in RTS games, but Joint Task Force has painfully bad and often harmful pathfinding, with units running themselves repeatedly into obstacles and getting stuck or directly into the enemy and getting destroyed, even when a shorter, simpler, and safer route is available. Combined with the fact that your units will often refuse to perform automatic reactions like they're supposed to, such as firing on nearby enemies or healing injured allies, and the game just becomes a micromanagement nightmare that's not worth the effort.",

At least update the description to reflect this. Also had to install an outdated 'Legacy' driver for physx to get it to work at all.",
