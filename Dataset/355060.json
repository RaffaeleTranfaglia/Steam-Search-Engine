            "review_text": " Do I recommended this game for you? No Never. Even not after the awfull patch after 2 months     Introduction    Dear Milestone,  I am very surprised by your work. You've as company improved a lot from WRC 1 2 3 and 4. It is not in the class of Dirt Rally, but it's a huge improvement over these previous games. There are some remarkable things to see; like tracks, cars, graphics, skytexures, and more.   I am glad to give you the important points I've found in your game. If you can fix this you can perhaps stand proudly next to Dirt Rally; this means you can challenge each other to be become better over the years.   Competition is what we need as customers, as gamers, as rally-enthusiasts, and more. I hope you do something with my feedback and not neglect to support the game. Good luck!   The bugs and design choices; highlighted the most important   -  No auto-center-steering when restart/reset.   -   I am using a TX servo base, default 900 degrees, in-game automatic, etc. There is no steering for like 180 degrees from the center, so 90 left, 90 right.    - 900 degrees feels like 1800, 540 like 900, etc etc. (Mostly on FWD and RWD)  - Old FWD / RWD / AWD feels ackward compared to Modern AWD cars  - Can't make tiny corrections while steering. Steering is very rude.   - Cars are too tame; RWD's too planted, can throttle 100% out of corners, etc.   - Concrete bushes, pole, trash bins and more. No 'rag-doll'  - When rolling on the roof you can see though the road  -  Pause button can't be remapped.    -   No subtitles for in video's   -   No fov adjustement for triple screen    -  Very understeery   - Setup slots are shared slots for all cars.   - Texture pop-ups, like fences, trees etc.   -  No real damage. Damage is set to heavy, but nothing happens. Only visual. Seems to be very random   - Little to no punctures/flatties; Too robust, but it can happen.  -   No multiply devices support; means a different wheel and different pedals will not work together (as example T300 + Fanatec pedals will not work. In other 'sims' they will)    - Bugged keybindingmapping  - Tracks too wide, but that's probably a good things with the awful steering on a lot of cars.    - Wheel calibration must show the actual wheel degrees; when you go to the right you must have 900% when using 900% degrees. Now you don't know what wheel degrees you will have when you must calibrate to the right which results in incorrect input.     What I like   - Cars; I want to tame all the FWD's that Dirt Rally has &lt;3  - Tracks; they remind me of RBR vanilla. Which are awesome too.   - Graphics  - Sky-textures  - Overall presentation; Menu, Loeb experience.  - Triple screen.  - Force Feedback, also when lost a tyre.    Below the changelog:   - Support 21:9 - Good, but no fov-adjustement - Fix Saves - Good - Support Triple-monitor - Good, but no fov adjustement - Fixed Logitech wheels minor issues - Don't have a logitech - Fixed Time Upload issues - Good - Minor Fixes - No idea what they have fixed.    Conclusion     The steering is still awfull as before the patch. It's the same as before... but with triple screen support.    Next time when you release Loeb Evo 2 or any other rally-game please consider the help of Early Access. All your problems could have been solved by Early-Access or experienced Beta-testers.   Have a fine day.  Ivy.    Tips for the stubborn people; Don't calibrate your wheel. Set pacenotes on early or so and steer a lot of meters in advance. use gloves to prevent blisters, cause you need to rotate the wheel a lot due poor steering/handling [/b[ Tested with a Thrustmaster TX, T3PA-Pro's, Heusinkveld Seq Shifter, Th8A ",

EDIT: I CANNOT EVEN EDIT FREAKING KEYBORD CONTROLS ON THIS STEAMING PILE OF...  I HAVE TO HIT F2 TO GO INTO ADVANCED WHEEL SETTINGS TO EVEN BACK OUT OF CONTROL CONFIG BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY KEY ANYWHERE THAT WORKS IF YOU HIT THE ENTER KEY TO CHANGE A CONTROL?  It doesn't recognise my pedals. I literally CANNOT remap this game to make it recognise anything..........   I can't comment on the game itself. I've yet to test it. :S   DO NOT. I REPEAT.

            "review_text": "THE DEMO DOES NOT DO THIS GAME JUSTICE!   It's running a old build of the game, the full game i had a +50% performance increase from about 50-55 FPS to +100 now. I don't know what Milestone was thinking but that is the reality.   +Many different cars to choose from from different eras of rally +Real stages +Rallycross +Other fun modes +Good pacenotes no robotic sound like WRC5, they are simple to understand +A campaign mode that is a lot more expansive than in Dirt Rally +Also a second campaign mode where you experience Seb Loeb's career as a rally driver +Good handling (not simulator, but not arcade either. Kind of a middle thing) +Steering wheel support for many different brands. +Online multiplayer with leaderboards + PVP +More than 300KM of road.   -Sounds are very 'meh' -Damage is wierd and random. Sometimes window smashes for unknown reasons -Milestone still insists on using their horrible launcher -Lacking in graphic options. It's not entirely bad but could be alot better! -No triple screen support -No support for individual componements (if i have a different shifter for G27 it wont work. Even WRC5 has support for this!! Come on Milestone)  Still a very good rally game, and definetely worth picking up for retail or discount price.",

            "review_text": "From videos I didn't like the game, but I gave it a go with demo version and I got surprised. The game is actually quite good. The physics are OK, way better than any game from WRC series.  PROs: Insane fun Career more of Forza style, not like DiRT Rally so it's everytime something diferrent. Rallycross and Pikes Peak with any car Great graphics As only game has Group S Real Rallycross tracks (rally tracks are not real) Having your own team Loeb Experience - you can live Seb's life You buy cars, instead of winning them.  CONs: Milestone doesn't know how to support low-end PCs (I use 720p on 1080p monitor - 30fps) expensive DLCs and Season Pass 6 Rallycross tracks (more than DiRT Rally has, but still...) Event cars with no purpose. They are just the same as normal rallycars, but they are ugly, you can't change their livery and all windows except front windshield are blacked out, so you can't see a thing  !!!! YOU NEED TO SKIP TUTORIAL AND THAN CHANGE SETTINGS. FIRST YOU NEED TO RESET THEM (F1), THAN YOU CAN SET THEM UP. Otherwise there would be no way for you to drive or even pause the game. You can do the tutorial again afterwards by going to garage and clicking tutorial.",

The tracks are great, the Career mode is varied, nice content to keep you busy. It is much better than expected, and much better than the demo. Don't trust the negative reviews, as currently all of them (except one from RacingIvysaur) are from people with a playtime less than 2h. This game is a lot of fun! ",

Car details more better then DIRT Rally, physics are very interesting and tons of cars. Stages are really nice. So detailed! But u need to understand game is looks more like beta, Bugs, fails - here it is.  Overall i think game is good as rally sim. Depend on me exp in real life (Celica ST185), RBR and DIRT rally i think it good. Really good, just need more time and patches. Hope mil's dont give up on this game and SL Rally EVO will shine.",

I've apparently spent a whole hour trying to play this game, and in all that time all I've done is seen the main menu once. Account for about 5 minutes spent customizing a player and team that I'll never ♥♥♥♥ing use, that's 55 minutes spent waiting for something that shouldn't even take a hundredth of that time.  On top of that, to close the game I've had to turn my whole PC off, since Task Manager can't even close it fully, rather leaving it to just cause periodic lag that lasts for about a minute across the whole computer, further demonstrating what a cancer this game is.  The demo somehow worked better than the original game, but it's still appalling. Never ever buy this game.  EDIT: oh yeah, forgot to say: buy DiRT Rally. It's probably cheaper and insanely more rewarding, because Codemasters actually know what they're doing.",

Steering is good to very good - Do people even adjust wheel settings? FFB is pretty good (I'm very picky) Physics are good to very good.  Some complain about input lag. I play on a good Desktop and alittle 'lesser' laptop. NO input lag on desktop but have some on laptop. However i do on other games as well when using laptop - I have a long HDMI into TV.  There are a few minor bugs as per most new games, but game has been very stable from day 1  Desktop - GTX 670, 6 core AMD 16 gig ram Win 7 Laptop - GTX 675m, I7, 12 gigs ram",

            "review_text": "Updated: Aftwe Three Days: * It would be nice if when you closed the app that it let Steam know so I didn't have to kill that process to close my computer. * It would be nice if when you opened the app you actually remembered that I use a wheel, not a keyboard. You certainly seem to remember all the settings. Just not that I use it. * It would be nice if I didn't have to set my language options to English-UK (rule britania!) instead of English-whatever so that my save files don't corrupt and at least I have my races. * It would be nice to know where the config file resides so I can back it up because I don't trust your program anymore. I don't feel I should play it until I know I won't have to restart again. For the third time. * It would be nice if the DLC cars you give a purchaser for free actually showed in the garage instead of making us wait 60 to 80 seconds for the process to buy it for free. For each car. * It would be nice if your menu didn't take 30 seconds to load a simple menu UI every freaking time. * It would be nice if you responded to the community.  After Two Days: Wow, there is a lot of borked stuff here. Time updates. Save files, Processes getting stuck so that you have to kill the process for Steam to restart the game. Pretty bad. Can only recommend for the really PC technically-minded.   After One Day: Well, I got it on sale last night and the 'Loeb Experience' videos are probably worth the price of the game. Even with out driving any cars. But I am a fan of the man.  The physics - as many before me have pointed out - are lacking. Or you could say, old. They work fine, just not up to the standards that were set by others while this was still in development. Frame rates and the system in general is stable for me (16gb ram, i5, 640gx) so I have no complaints in that area.  Car modifications are reasonable, except for paint which looks more like it was half don and then dropped for some reason. Not much there.   Sounds are decent. meh  THe worst part is the fact that something less than stellar has Mssr Loeb's name on it. Just erks me.",
