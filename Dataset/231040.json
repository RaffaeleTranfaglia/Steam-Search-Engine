They just become part of the challenge and I feel you can master them without being too irritated about it. The pure fun and enjoyment of simple but groovy gameplay is all worth it though and the puzzles do progress the further you go. I've been playing this game with my projector on a 100 inch scale and the visuals and detail in the art are mind-blowing. At times it's like an lsd-trip.  This game was completely worth it for me.  If you're not sure, just get it in a sale, you won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "Although lots of people think this puzzle game isn't hard at all and the music sometimes just become annoying while players stay in a scene for a long time, I would still recommend this game. First of all, with the beat music here, I say the developer team has a good intention to make the undersea lively and they succeed. The scenes of undersea here aren't dark and quiet but lively and bright. The design of the stages with the concept of the beat sound from objects which are interative and those which aren't have their own styles. Second, the puzzles here are simple. However, the standard about difficulty of puzzles is different based on players' different gaming experience and the experience they're seeking from thie game. To me, puzzle games don't have to be hard to challenge but simple to relax myself.So, in my opinion, if you don't want to beat it one day after playing several hours but just relax yourself by playing games, it's good for you, too. Last but not least, the game will be around 2 bucks on sale, which is pretty cheap to get. If you're pretty sure that this game is your type or at least you won't hate this game, I would say it's worth the price with the hours you spend enjoying youself.",

The environment is beautiful and feels so alive since it is always a part of the music, which, is outstanding in itself as well as the way it fits the game.

            "review_text": "Pretty cool game. Plays like a puzzle platformer but without the platforming, since you swim about freely. Kind of like a simpler Aquaria without the Metroid structure.  While a lot of the gameplay is governed by the rhythm of the music, I don't find that this sets the game terribly much apart from platformers with timing-heavy challenges, such as Donkey Kong Country. Rather, the main draw here is Beatbuddy's personality and soundtrack: every time a character speaks, the text box is backgrounded by a different beatboxing track, and, as you move through the stages, the music changes in complexity depending upon what's happening around you.  This sense that features of the level design are actually creating the music doesn't seem as potent or as 1:1 as in some other games that have done similar, most notably 140, but the music itself is good. Beatbuddy isn't going to blow your mind, but it's an enjoyable experience overall and well worth picking up at a sale price.",

The story is really engaging due to how your actions affect the world. The game is extremely linear, but you really do feel like what you do in each level is determining your progression—uuuuuuuuuup until the game's climax, which was really unsatisfying.

Cons: - Game is actually short. I don't know how long it takes to finish the game, but after you did you feel unpleased. - Controls. I think best controls are with mouse only if your keyboard can't stand ghosting (for this game you often need to click 3 buttons at once). Mouse isn't great either, especially when you have to pick/drop an object... - Big SnareMonsters or whatever they're called. Just hate those things. I got bumped by it many times by them.

Beat is a cute character, and the art style is vibrant and visually pleasing. The art is pretty, and the underwater theme is rather well executed.

You can pick chapters within each level, which would be great, if it would actually count each chapter's collections seperately, but as it is, if you want to collect all beat points in a level, you must play through the entire level.

The presentation is really creative, and the art original. The worlds are varied (with the exception of enemies only two in the entire game...) the Musc is very enjoyable and the fact that it builds up as you explore further gives a really gratifying feeling.  However while the artsy part of the game is great, the 'Game' part really doesn't keep up. For starters the narator has a tendency to mimic DJ scratching when he speaks. While it is a very interesting idea the result of it are cutscenes that are painfully long because of him, delaying any sense of conclusion at each and every sentence. Thank god they appear only rarely in the game. The whole game is underwater which makes it impossible to have granular control. You'll often find yourself restarting mutiple times parts where very precise tasks are required to be done in very little time. Furthermore as you don't gain short invulnerability when hit and enemies love to push you around when they hit you  will  find yourself being bounced about to your inevitable death. This happenning quite often it is one of the main reason while you will start cursing the game for not being forgiving. Level design is not very well thought out either, you will often find yourself trying to find out why you can't go there, if you are actually supposed to be there and stuck because you went somewhere you weren't supposed to be. All these issues lead to a hot mess of frustration and anger, powerless against a game that punishes you for being to curious. And it really is a shame that the actual gameplay is the worst part of the game, leaving what otherwise would've been a enjoyable experiment.  Even though BeatBuddy has the looks of a fun rythm/exploration game, it's faulty game mechanics and ill conceived levels put an swift end to any enjoyable experience. Therefore I cannot recommend this game.",

The puzzles are bland and after the first fifteen times you bounce off plants after aligning a couple drum-things, it gets rather boring. Plus I encountered game breaking bugs like when, during a chase scene in Chapter Two, I could not shoot through the pillars to escape the giant fish head. There was also the time my character disappeared from the screen entirely, and I had to restart the game. It does have a nice feature where, if your computer has changeable colored lights on the front, they will pulse and change color with the music and environment.  I did not finish this game, as I could not proceed past the aforementioned bug, and it was getting repetitive. Maybe the puzzles (and music) get more varied as you go on, but I don't feel compelled enough to find out.  C- I felt this game had some interesting mechanics, but they weren't fleshed out enough. Plus, game stopping bugs.",

The controls felt really weird through out the game and I never got the hang of driving the vehicle. I just rammed through everything. Few bugs here and there and bad design choises overall gave a bad impression. The art was okay mostly, but didn't strike as something I would remember. Though sometimes the art cluttered the screen so that I didn't see anything I was doing. Too much stuff going on on the screen. Characters were good, but not used much, so the story was very thin. Most of the time I wasn't sure what was going on. Level design didn't help when I was just pushing one way without knowing what I'm supposed to do next or where I'm going. The game just wasn't fun to play and the beat/music part felt sometimes superimposed. The soundtrack was good though. ",
