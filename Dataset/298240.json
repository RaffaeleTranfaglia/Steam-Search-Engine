            "review_text": "Alot of people have said this, but this game is a pay-to-win game. I have been playing since the beginning of Rc2 in 2013. The game was okay, obivously the game in that state of time wasn't the best. Overtime Rc2 became better, becoming the game I would spend most of my time playing. Then RCF came around and everything change. I'm assuming RGS were determine to make money of this version of the game. So they added War chests, Legendary chests, new weapons every week. In the past (Rc2), you normally got what you pay for. Like for instance, Gold weapons cost 1000 coins. That's about $30. With the introduction of War chests, I lost over $500 dollars, but I know what you're probaly thinking. It's risky but we're talking ten year olds kids steling money from their parents, just to get this some 'special' gun. I know, I've been there. I don't recommend anyone to this game because RGS don't care about the fans, they f___ing care about making easy money. Thank you if you spend 5 minutes of your day to view this.",

Bad graphics: This looks like its played on a play station 2 or original xbox. 2. Bad controls: They seem weird and clunky. 3. God awful voice acting: I think I've only hear 2 voices the entire game: The very unitimidating drill sargeant, and the guy who says something like 'whe'll get em next time' when you lose a game. Your soldiers don't say anything, so it makes the battle boring. 4. Bad sound: The guns sound like ♥♥♥.  This could be a good game, but it's very underdeveloped.",

I wish this game had VR because it would like being in the battlefield itself.  The sound is ultra good also. Every gun makes noise! The voice acting is top notch too, who ever the actor was that voiced the line 'enemy down' should win an award.  Gameplay wise you cannot beat this game. The controls are super tight.

It is very p2w but I haven't encountered anyone yet who completely dominated the game since their items were so powerful. I haven't spent a cent on this game and still manage to get about a 2 kdr every round, so this game is not awfully unbalanced. I enjoy infantry combat over vehicular and play infantry only much more, so I can't make any remarks on the vehicles. I encourage anyone who actually read my review to at least give the game a try, and uninstall it if its not appealing to you.",

There empty, boring, and a pain to traverse.   *There is a lack of maps and two of them are the same exact one except one has snow.  *the graphics are ♥♥♥♥ even for a free to play game.  *the combat itself is mindless, not even call of duty mindless where you atleast get some satisfaction from killing something. The guns make no noise, have no recoil, and when the bullets hit someone the character dosent flinch and when you do get shot at, you dont even realize it since you have no reaction. No jam on the screen,no slowing down, nothing.  *the community sucks.... period  *with the big maps the game has veichles, like... two... maybe three. And they suck too. no weight, slow or slippery, and the combat is exactly like the gunplay. mindless and unsatifying.  *GLITCHY AS BALLS, terrain disapering, geting stuck in objects.

Has many gun selections  (THERE's a bad side tro this though.....greedy devs' have REDICULOUS PRICES for their guns/vehicles: which some are released even though they are bugged or broken.)   Now that we got the good out of the way here is  Hackers heaven, devs do nothing about it or respond really late to it.  Bugged out game.....SO MANY Bugs it ain't even funny, you'd think they would have like a time-frame of trying to fix  them little by little. BUT NO! they instead just keep releasing more guns and vehicles to sell and leave ♥♥♥♥ as broken as it is.  No Team BALANCING. Players who do spend money and buy this premium weapons often STACK on one team and ♥♥♥♥ all the free play players. WHY, easy in game currency points. Yep aside from gold coins you buy, you can also stack up on0 'Honor Points' the in game currency. Players often find ways of farming this be it losing on purpose or stacking one team side and make it be 9 vs 3 -_-. So fair suuuure.   Horrible Community players are rude, rude spoken, disrespectful, insulting. Also rarely anyone speaks english and no voice chat (&lt;- but I htink thats a good thing there's no voice.)  Games been out for ages and is currently being revamped to new UNITY 5 coding but the same problems if not more exist. In meantime as I said the devs communicate poorly to the community. Just about the more communication they do is to PROMOTE THE NEW WEAPON or VEHICLE they have for sale.   I'll leave it at this...because this game has left such a bad taste in my mouth after years of playing believing it would get better, but DEVS let you down once again...you'd think they would consider changing the prices of things to make it better for others to aquire just as good weapons too but nope.   PLAY SOMETHING else theres tons better free to play shooters that are more balanced, better maintained, less hackers and better community.",
