            "review_text": "It's not a terribly difficult game, and you'll probably finish it before all the cards drop, but there are certainly worse ways to spend a buck or less if it's on sale. It's a capable platformer that controls well and plays well. The only real complaint I had was the enemies that shoot things randomly, I died a few times just by being unlucky, whereas if they had an actual pattern, it would be a bit less cheap. But it didn't happen often enough to make the game unenjoyable. Certainly worth picking up.",
