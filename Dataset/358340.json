    "description": "Word Rescue is an incredible adventure for kids who want to rescue all the stolen words from the mean ol' Gruzzles. The Gruzzles can't read, and they don't want anyone else to read. So, they've stolen the words out of all of our books! Benny Bookworm needs your help to stop the Gruzzles.",

            "review_text": "This game is much harder than I remember, and I played it on the highest difficulty. I picked this up in the Apogee pack, most of which I had as shareware when I was a child. I am of course much older than the demographic audience now, and I had a blast with this game when I was a kid. It's still a very challenging platformer at higher difficulty because the game has quite a bit of depth for players who which to go for the perfect run, The RNG can be a bit unfair at times and the nature of the monsters not moving off screen seems unfair at first, but this can be used to your own advantage when you are out of ammunition. Matching images while spelling out words (much like spelling out NUKEM in Duke Nukem 1&amp;2, it must be in order) still trips me up from time to time. So the game gives you a good amount to keep track of at a higher difficultly. The music is pleasant, and none of it is phoned in. My only complaint is that 'Orange', because of the EGA pallet, appears red. Definitly a buy for a young child, and a welcome addition if you are looking for something to trip you up mentally as you try to remember where NOT to drop into a mismatching image, which spoils your run, wastes you ammo, and potentially can kill you.",
