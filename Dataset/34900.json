            "review_text": "I was tempted to roundly deride Bat Rats: the Rats' Revenge. Among it's various sins include blatant typos, unclear measurement units, terrible grammar, and awful physics that ruin the very heart of the game itself. I mean, what kind of physics-based puzzle game do you have when the physics malfunction half of the time? Balls flying out into an unneccessary third dimension, assuming you even correctly triggered your first step with your rat set at 38 Rat Angular Units to go after 40 Rat Time Units.   But I digress, the game is flawed, to be sure. In fact as I was churning my way through this game, the livestream audience goading me on as though demons with lashes made of fire and thorns, I began to see this game for what it was; Divine retribution. After thirty maps or so, when blood from my very eyes began to splatter my keyboard, I truly understood why Bad Rats was put on this planet.  Initially, I began to lose faith. As would any man, I questioned many things during this trial. 'Why would God do this to me? Why would a God of 'Good' let a game such as 'Bad Rats' Ever be created?' And on and on I questioned. I questioned God's purpose, my purpose, and the purpose of the tormentor who had begun to work my fingers to the very bone.   Finally, it dawned on me.  A game of such pure agony, such pure punishment, could never have been crafted by mortal hands. At last I realized that the only reason God would allow such a travesty as Bad Rats into this world is to be an obstacle to overcome to understand that truly he exists. To be sure, Bad Rats may have been programmed by 'imagine4' but the developer was none other than Christ Jesus. How else would such a perfect trial have been crafted but through the intervention of the only being that could craft the cosmos into the reality that you and I enjoy every day? That is the power that was put into Bad Rats. That is the power that has turned this game into an engine of languish.   I highly reccomend Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge, but know that you should not accept such a task lightly. You may experience Bad Rats different from the way I did, but nonetheless you will emerge from it a changed person.",

This game helped me get through school with straight As. It also gave me super powers. People who downvote this game clearly don't know what they're talking about. This is the future.

When most people think of perfect games they think of the classics like Call of Duty: Ghosts and The Order 1886, but this is better then both of those combined by far.  If you love yourself enough to not want to end it all on a daily basis, then you should buy this game, I'm not sure why it is so cheap all the time though, I'd happily pay $70 for this experience.",

I didn't want to tell my mother because they always said that it was a sin and I would never be allowed back home if I was gay. I kept this a secret for five whole years, and I tried my best not to get off with gay stuff. I tried and tried to make myself straight, but I couldn't. I don't have a job and they are paying for my college education. I felt scared because I can't find a job anywhere and I don't want to lose my college education.  So this evening my worst fear came true. I was visiting them and my mom came across my journal and read something I wrote when I was 14 or so. She banged on the door of my room and barged in. At this point, I could no longer hide the truth from her. I finally told her I was gay and I couldn't help it. She was scared, and she said 'You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'. I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could tell that this cab was rare but I thought now 'Forget it. Yo Holmes, to Bel Air!' I pulled up to the house at around 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo Holmes, smell ya later!' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to sit on the throne as the prince of Bel Air.",

It's not just the phenomenal animmation or the fantastical gameplay or the stunning models or the musical score so soaked in post-modern existentialist dubstep remixes of popular 1990's children's cartoons that you will ♥♥♥♥ yourself in auditory delight or the Stevie Wonder-making 2d sprites; no, there is something so magically right with this game that it can only be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest game developers in history and gave them all the task of creating a film as magnificent as this, not one of them, with all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be considered as a contender. Not one 24fps 900p rendered Ellen Page hair would rival any painstakingly hand-animated by third-world children pixel in Bad Rats.  The centerpiece of this eureka-inducing Tom Hanks spasm is the Fat Rat. Without it, this would still be the best game ever made, but with it Bad Rats is the greatest best most amazing lifestyle (not a game, mom) ever made. The Fat Rat has been described as a diabetic hippie, a Croatian velociraptor, possibly from Norway, clearly a product of Usimare Ramesses III and Alexander the Great's illigetimate love affair, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these things are true at any one moment (except for the diabetes). It is a tantalizing mystery stuffed inside an enigma wrapped in fur and smothered in pixels. You will fall in love with this rat even as you are repelled by it from the first moment it steps into the game on level 4 with its wide John Candy style love handles and thick bulbous shoulders packed into an oddly fitting 40-polygon model, and its jagged .jpg destroyed texture. The Fat Rat looks out of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been anything else like it. Nor will there ever be.  Play this game at all costs. Play it twice. Or three times. Or as one grizzled war veteran that I met from Milwaukee has, 12 times! See it until you can recite every precious level password this  game  masterpiece of modern art has to offer. Let Bad Rats become your new religion and the Fat Rat your prophet preaching the gospel according to Papa John.  My dream is to someday buy an arcade with machines that play nothing but Bad Rats 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until the nearby town disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream as well.

With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning. Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame. He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at himself, a minstrel man, burntcorked, in the mirror. Later, going to sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles, in the dark. It never went away, that. smile, it never ever went away, as long as he remembered. He hung up his black-beetle-coloured helmet and shined it, he hung his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered luxuriously, and then, whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of the fire station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a squeaking halt, the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs. He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward the subway where the silent, air-propelled train slid soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a great puff of warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the suburb. Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He walked toward the comer, thinking little at all about nothing in particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name. The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment before his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a person's standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant.",

Bad Rats borrows gameplay aspects from Fez, Gone Home, and even GoGo Nippon. The story was deep, almost too deep it got to moments where it made me ♥♥♥♥ myself just from how funny the jokes were and when    the main charecter Victor's sister dies it made me think about all the passed ones in my life.

He actually bought it for all of his friends, but ended up not buying it for himself. I guess he ran out of money, being generous, after buying it for five of his friends.  Now before I get too far into my opinion of the actual game itself, I'd just like to say I have played only the first level. During the first level, however, I was tested and challenged far beyond my ability to comprehend physics and such. I mean, they went through the time to perfect just that part of the game; the physics, and that's what really matters. The artstyle is also very unique; I've honestly never seen such a smooth, beautiful style in any game ever, besides maybe Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which, by the way, is a very great RTS game, and you should check it out.  Anyways, onto just the first level. In the first level, you are tasked to kill a cat with nothing but a Rat holding a baseball bat, a crate, a barrel, a wooden plank, and a baseball, which is already placed on the screen for you. You are challenged to set the pieces you get correctly so that the Rat will hit the falling baseball with his bat, sending it up the ramp you made with the board, crate, and barrel, hit the safe with the ball, sending it falling down onto the defenseless cat.  The animation is just perfect, especially the blood and gore that is produced from said cat after being smashed by the safe. Trust me, eyeballs and brains being thrown yards away from a cat is just glorious.  Enough about that, though. What really matters is that you are forced to use your brain in this game. Think about this for a second. You are forced to use your brain in this game.  That's what really makes the game special.    However, if you wanted to use your brain in a game you'd just go play Battlefield or Roblox or something.  TL;DR : You have to use your brain, but the gameplay and graphics are immensely unique. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys the First Person Shooter genre, as well as anything that might be considered 'kawaii' or 'sugoi'.",

Back in 1776 when our glorious country was founded. Our forefathers had a few ideals in mind for basic rights every U.S.A citizen was entitled to: Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Obviously, they were referring to Bad Rats. Bad Rats grants life to new born babies. Every time this holy game is opened, a baby is born and his life is amazing because he's part Bad Rats. Bad Rats grants liberty, demonstrating that you MUST rebel against your overlords (the cats) by throwing balls at chainsaws to kill your foes in comical and poorly animated ways. It is a game with many unique metaphors and representations to truly drive the point of Liberty (and freedom) across to all who play it. And as for the pursuit of happiness, I can say that I have never smiled more than when I played this game. Seeing a baby kitten has nothing on the smile this game will create for you. In short, Bad Rats is the holiest of games founded by our forefathers. If you do not play the greatest game ever made, then you are worse than a terrorist and are NOT welcome in our country. Praise 'Murica 12/10. There is no light in the world that compares to the glorious, shining star that is Bad Rats.",

Sure, it throws you in with a M16A4, B92 and M9 but there are so much interesting features it's not the same mindless killing such as which is depicted in Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises. There are many interesting in-depth features such as chambering rounds, crafting, and dynamic destruction (miles better than the gimmick of 'levolution'). It's a breath of fresh air and playing it, I haven't left with a bitter taste in my mouth, but rather as if I've dined in a fine restaurant. All the game mechanics all click together and work together like a well-oiled machine. The gunplay is satisfying and doesn't wear out, the maps are designed intricately and encourages team-play that usually won't be found in Battlefield. Overall I think this is the best game I've ever played.  You should buy this game if you want a breath of fresh air from the crowded and oversaturated genre of 'modern military shooters'. I have played this game on and off for several years, and never would I tire. I still linger on playing this game once in a while.    FINAL REVIEW SCORE        3/10     ",

This game literally changed my outlook on life, made me question issues that never came to my mind, forget Gone Home, Bioshock Infinite, and The Last of Us, Bad Rats truly deserved game of the year 2013. After playing this game, I literally had to sit down and take a deep mental reflection on who I was, this game made me question things like who I really was and what I believed in like never before. This is the game designed for men with MIT degrees and hardcore philosophers to play and discuss. Truly, this game is the pinnacle of human creation.  So lets get started on what makes such a god-like game:  The Soundtrack: The soundtrack can't simply be described with words, it rivals the work of nobles, gods, even. As soon as I started up the game and the intro theme filled my ears I was left stunned; I never knew audio could come in such stunning quality, it was like I was getting the music played to me LIVE. Still, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing and words won't do it much justice, it's just something you'll have to experience for yourself  The Gameplay: The gameplay seems simple at first, each level is a puzzle, use a preset pool of items and use it to murder a cat. Seems simple, right? No. The puzzle building and the physics engine is so intricate it would feel like you're building a lean, mean, cat-killing machine all with your mouse. You feel like a god, building up contraptions from nearly nothing, and destroying anything you feel like, even the protagonists, the rats. Seeing those puzzles you've solved in motion just brings enough joy and excitement to bring tears to your eyes. You are a god in this game, merciful or brutal, the choice is up to you.  The Art Style: This game looks at modern gaming, and looks at it's bland super-realistic, bland, and 'omg its just like one of my japanese hentays' type artstyles, and spits on them all, without even trying. The game uses simple models and shading, because it wants to remind us of our roots, where gaming used to be, when we didn't have such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ industry like we do now. It's simplicity and beauty is what brings joy to my heart, a savior in gaming art styles.  The Story: Rats &gt; Cats   Overall (tl;dr): This game made me cry This game made me reconsider my life This game is... something",

One team is made up of 4 BaddleRats and the other is made up of depressed cats who really don't want to fight anymore but the rats are uner the regime of a rat who can be compared to Adolf Hitler. Hitler Rat is known for building a large cat concentration camp called Moushwitz. The Baddlerats kill and capture the depressed cats.

Bad Rats did not receive any critic review to be aggregated on Metacritic,[1] and, according to Kotaku, is a 'putridly awkward', 'nearly universally reviled' game.[2] However, its appearance on the Steam marketplace in 2009, at a time when that platform was relatively tightly curated for quality, caused it to stand out as an oddity. It attracted a community of followers still active in 2015, six years after its release. Bad Rats received a majority of positive user reviews, possibly beginning the Steam trend of users jokingly giving over-the-top positive reviews to bad games, and became a popular gift to troll other players with.[2] Rock, Paper, Shotgun described it as 'the gaming equivalent of neckties with kooky prints or fart-scented soap'.[3]  Sequel[edit] A sequel to Bad Rats, titled Bad Rats Show, was released on 20 July 2016.[3]  External links[edit] Official website References[edit] Jump up ^ 'Bad Rats: The Rats Revenge Critic Reviews for PC'.

Suddenly, my eye wandered over to the 'Recommended for You' section of the catalog during my innocent browsing period filled to the brim with anticipation for a new game. As I slowly looked up and down the list, I stumbled upon the final item in the list. 'Bad Rats,' I mouthed the title of the curious game out silently. Almost immediately after whispering the name I heard something ring from the inside of my head. A scream. One of pain, suffering, and pure malice.  '...Bad Rats,' I uttered again, being accompanied by a cacophony of fearful sobbing and agonizing shrieks, ones only I was seemingly capable of hearing.  Shaking off that feeling, I took a quick glimpse at the price. Only a meager 19 cents, no doubt due to one of Steam's signature sale periods, leaving this game at a whopping 81% off! I looked at my Steam wallet as I clicked on the game's full page. I had around 24 cents at that time. My curious eyes widened as I read the description. Realistic physics? Puzzles? Fun? This game seemed right up my alley. Seeing as how my mere 24 cents weren't going to be put to use in another way, I quickly pressed the 'Add to Cart' button, but maybe a bit  too  quickly, as what happened next was beyond my expectations. My vision was obstructed by an image constructed by my vast, everexpanding mind. As I recall, it was not a pretty sight, because legs are not supposed to bend the way they were bending in the picture, for humans, anyway. These were my first signs that something behind this title screen was truly sinister. Like an oaf, though, I chose to blame my tiredness from school earlier in the day about these visions. After purchasing the game, it downloaded within around 3 minutes and I launched the game. And then it happened. My eyes were assaulted. My body froze up. My mouth hung open as a quiet groan surfaced from below. The things I saw. The things I heard. The things I felt inside. Incomprehensible among words. There were no screams. There was no time. There was only rats. And then, nothing. This game has consumed me. It is now a part of me, as much as I am a part of it. There is no escaping the rats. There is no remorse, no mercy, no nothing. It has sucked the life out of me, leaving me as an empty husk of a human, as I twitched and teared up. The rats have taken me with them, and I cannot escape. I'll never forget what I saw, those images have been burned into my mind for the remainder of my poor life. What's left of my heart goes out to those who suffered my same fate, and will never be the same again.",

However, the true genius of Bad Rats is in it's intricately woven storyline, something that many developers in the industry today should take note of. While the game may state toherwise, I can confirm that the protagonist is actually a cat. 'So what?' you may ask, puzzled at the seeming absence of significance to this tidbit. Well, think about who you are killing throught the entire game. Cats, of course. You are being held captive by your worst enemies, forced to slaughter your loved ones (the cats have identical markings, perhaps a family trait) in unspeakably cruel ways. With this revelation, the enigma that is Bad Rats unravels. The game is TRYING to make you hate it. Poor level design, inconsistent mechanics, near nonexistant graphical configuration, it's all a ploy. They want to to despise your actions, your forced genocide. Bad Rats is a masterpiece of clnadestine storytelling, perhaps even surpassing the likes of From Software and Telltale Interactive. I implore Invent4 to create another Bad Rats, so that more can experience their finely tuned skills.  10/10  DAE BAD RATS?",

My mom hated me, for what I wanted to do with my life. Everyday I sat on my $4500 Rig playing everything from nintendo to sega games, I was happy but my mom wasn't, she called me everything under the sun: Nerd, Lazy, dissapointment. I loved that woman, she was the only person, who had utter Disdain for me, and it made me so horny, and happy. That was... untill it all boiled down on one day. I was playing Minecraft with my invisable friend: Oswald. and she came home, drunk, angry. She came into my room, and said to me: 'Son, I was wrong all my life, I will support you in anything you want to do, starting with this. I am so sorry, if I hurt you.' At that point, something in my head snapped. I grapped my knife on the table, and sharpened a small twig, and stabbed her in the heart, lungs, and ♥♥♥♥, twenty four and a half times. I was only four at the time when my mom died from sudden stab wounds. I was horrified, I swore to myself to find the person that killed my mother, and stole my gaming rig.   Thirty five years passed, and I never found anything... it seems as if everything was hopeless, like nothing mattered, and it was true, until I found this game Bad Rats for the Xbox one, the moment I started up the game, it felt as if God himself brushed his hand against my cheek, and said 'Blesst, be thy face... ♥♥♥♥♥.' I found reason to live again, I even forgot my mother's name, if anything I don't even think I had a mother. But it didn't matter, because at the end I had Bad(TM) Rats(TM) for the Xbox(TM) One(TM)... I was 18 now, old enough to smoke weeeeeeed and have sexual intercourse. I found and married this man, named Ryanski Eppleustus, after thirty years, he had begat seven children, and I forced them all to play Bad Rats. Thus giving me the idea, I must spread the word of Bad Rats, that all may hear it's glory. I went to The Reddits, and made Subsidal Reddits(TM) about Bad Rats, It gathered people rapidly, as all of United States, but not any other places heard the wonders of Bad Rats. Two days later, seven hundred thousand people came to my home in South Dakota, and looked upon me, as their leader. We went and formed cities, and colonized the Bermuda Triangle. The year was 2574 Bad Rats, when the great transcendance came. It swept through the nations of the world, burning all the heathens, and unbelievers. The Bad Rat formally known as God, came down to the burning earth and saved all the people of my nation, and we lived in heaven forever and ever, and every one, who hadn't played Bad Rats for the Xbox One, suffered for eternity. Amen.  4/10",

It's the classic underdog story: finally sick of the cats' tyranny and domination of their species, the rats rise up in a gruesome rebellion to see them crowned king of the animal kingdom. The plot reminds me of Half Life 2, except Bad Rats pulls it off in a much more successful fashion.  The gameplay is puzzle based. You are presented with a scenario in which a cat needs to be murdered, and you are tasked with using a variety of objects to activate some sort of murder weapon (bomb, microwave, etc.). For example, you have to place a 'Batter Rat' such that a ball will fall in its path. The Rat swings the bat to send the ball flying into a bomb, which falls and explodes on a cat. The strategy and depth knows no bounds, and among the greatest and most intellectually stimulating games of all time, Bad Rats stands alone.  Not only is Bad Rats the best game ever created, it truly is the best work ever produced by humanity. The pinnacles of art, science, literature, engineering and medicine fall well short of the sheer perfection that is Bad Rats. I feel truly blessed to be born in the same era as this unrivaled perfection.  4 stars / 5",

            "review_text": "Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] ( listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer ('leader') of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was a central figure of the Holocaust.  Hitler was born in Austria, then part of Austria-Hungary, and raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party, the precursor of the NSDAP, in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ('My Struggle'). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.  By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, which led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans—actions which gave him significant popular support.  Hitler sought Lebensraum ('living space') for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned.  Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen ('sub-humans') and socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare, and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history.",

            "review_text": "Bad Rats is a 1941 American drama game produced by, co-written by, directed by and starring Orson Welles. The picture was Welles's first feature game. The game was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories; it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles. Considered by many critics, game makers, and fans to be the greatest game ever made, Bad Rats was voted the greatest game of all time in five consecutive Sight &amp; Sound 's polls of critics, until it was displaced by Vertigo in the 2012 poll. It topped the American game Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as AFI's 2007 update. Bad Rats is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, and narrative structure, which were innovative for its time. The story is a game à clef that examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, and aspects of Welles's own life. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the game in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is told through the research of a newsreel reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: 'Rosebud'. After the Broadway successes of Welles's Mercury Theatre and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast 'The War of the Worlds' on The Mercury Theatre on the Air, Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939. Unusual for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have final cut privilege. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for Bad Rats, collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the game received its American release in 1941. While a critical success, Bad Rats failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The game faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as André Bazin and given an American revival in 1956. The game was released on Blu-ray Disc on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition. ",

            "review_text": "You may be asking yourself 'What the flying ♥♥♥♥ is this game?' I'm here to awnser that question. Bad Rats is the underrated gem of the underground gaming scene. Bad Rat's has captivated players like me with it's revolutionary realistic physics. For example, If you set up your Rats in a specific way and play it, it won't be the same the next time you start your puzzle! Even if you didn't even change anything and that really stops it from getting stale! The game also has 3-dimensional physics which is extremely innovative since the game is 2.5 D, Which means randomly the characters will spaz the ♥♥♥♥ and go forward outside of the puzzle area. The game also features creative and fun way's to murder cats because they killed your parents or something. The only downside of Bad Rat's is the story. It is terribly written and the voice acting is worse than 4kids anime dub. But the addictive and innovative gameplay keep the game fresh throughout the entire campaign. In an era in video games where 1 million First-Person shooters come out every month, Bad Rats is an extremely refreshing experiance.  If you need a fun game to keep you entertained for hours and hours, buy bad rats. Oh make sure you buy it for your friends, They will thank and worship you for permenantly imprinting this game in their steam library.  Final Verdict  11/10 its a masterpiece that noone should miss. A must have. Also like skyrim with guns.",

            "review_text": "William Henry 'Bill' Cosby Jr. (born July 12, 1937) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and activist.  Cosby's start in stand-up comedy began at the hungry i in San Francisco, followed by landing a starring role in the 1960s television show I Spy. During its first two seasons, he was also a regular on the children's television series The Electric Company.  Using the Fat Albert character developed during his stand-up routines, Cosby created, produced, and hosted the animated comedy television series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, a show centered on a group of young friends growing up in an urban area that ran from 1972 until 1985. Throughout the 1970s, Cosby starred in a number of films, occasionally returning to film later in his career. In 1976, Cosby earned a Doctor of Education degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His dissertation discussed the use of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids as a teaching tool in elementary schools.  Beginning in the 1980s, Cosby produced and starred in a television sitcom, The Cosby Show; the show aired from 1984 to 1992 and was rated as the number one show in America for five years, 1984 through 1989.[2] The sitcom highlighted the experiences and growth of an affluent African-American family. Cosby produced the Cosby Show spin-off sitcom A Different World, which aired from 1987 to 1993; starred in the sitcom Cosby from 1996 to 2000; and hosted Kids Say the Darndest Things for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000.

As a student, he described himself as a class clown. Cosby was the captain of both the baseball team and the track and field team at Mary Channing Wister Public School in Philadelphia, as well as the class president.[6] Early on, though, teachers noted his propensity for clowning around rather than studying.[7] At FitzSimons Junior High School, Cosby began acting in plays as well as CONTINUING his devotion to playing sports.[8] He went on to Philadelphia's Central High School, a magnet and university prep school.[8] In addition, Cosby was working before and after school, selling produce, shining shoes, and stocking shelves at a supermarket to help out the family.[8] He transferred to Germantown High School, but failed the tenth grade.[9] Instead of repeating, he got a job as an apprentice at a shoe repair shop, which he liked, but could not see himself doing the rest of his life.[8] Subsequently, he joined the Navy, serving at the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland and at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland.[10] During his four years in the Navy, Cosby served as a Hospital Corpsman working in PHYSICAL THERAPY with Navy and Marine Corps personnel injured during the Korean War.[10]  He finished his equivalency diploma via correspondence courses[11] and was awarded a track and field SCHOLARSHIP to Philadelphia's Temple University in 1961.[12] There, he studied physical education while running track and playing fullback on the university's football team.[citation needed]  As Cosby progressed through his undergraduate studies, he CONTINUED to hone his talent for humor, joking with fellow enlistees in the service and then with college friends. When he began bartending at a Philadelphia club to earn money, he became more aware of his ability to make people laugh. After using humor on his customers and seeing his tips increase, he then took his talent to the stage.[13]  Stand-up career Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy, lining up standup jobs at clubs first in Philadelphia and then in New York City, where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1962.[8] He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.. He received national exposure on NBC's The Tonight Show in the summer of 1963. This led to a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, who, in 1964, released his debut LP Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!, the first of a series of comedy albums.[citation needed]  While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore material that was controversial and sometimes risqué, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, 'A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? So I figure this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.'[14]  Younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld have credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of the genre of standup comedy, but also as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television. Seinfeld said of Cosby: 'He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote 'comic' and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see onstage.'[15] Comedian Larry Wilmore also saw a connection between Cosby's standup, in the concert film Bill Cosby: Himself, and the later success of the The Cosby Show, saying: 'It's clear that the concert is the template for The Cosby Show.'[15]  Cosby remains an actively touring stand-up comedian, performing at theaters throughout the United States. He performed his first TV standup special in 30 years, Bill Cosby: Far From Finished, on Comedy Central on November 23, 2013.[16]  Acting career  This section of a biographical article needs additional citations for verification.

(December 2014) I Spy In 1965, Cosby was cast alongside Robert Culp in the I Spy espionage adventure series on NBC. I Spy became the first weekly dramatic television series to feature an African American in a starring role.[17] At first Cosby and NBC executives were concerned that some affiliates might be unwilling to carry the series. At the beginning of the 1965 season, four stations declined the show; they were in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.[18] Viewers were taken with the show's exotic locales and the authentic chemistry between the stars, and it became one of the ratings hits of that television season. I Spy finished among the twenty most-watched shows that year, and Cosby would be honored with three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[19] When accepting his third Emmy for the show, Cosby told the audience: “Let the message be known to bigots and racists that they don’t count!”[19] ",

Gameplay The gameplay is astonishing, and has a flawless non-laggy object system in which you click &amp; drag said objects to use them on the 3D scene. It runs at a smooth 35 FPS and is suitable for numerous Windows versions, meaning the young ones who get a hold on this game can play it on the computers (if any) in their schools. I don't think it could've been done better. 10/10   2. Graphics The graphics are so realistic and can easily smash GTA 5 on ultra, along with one of my personal favorites, Minecraft, with shaders on. Compared to top titles like Metal Gear Solid 5, Call of Duty Black ops 3, and Fallout 4 Bad Rats might as well have graphics made centuries in the future, pre-apocalyptic events. Getting in the subject of the character models, I have to say my favorite rat is the bomber-rat. He is well-crafted and seems like money was sent into the creation of him, funded by ISIS. But all the rats are magnificent, and I better not dip down into character development. Speaking of, next topic.   Story/Character Development The story is interesting, and has very strong messages on racism, homophobia, and lung cancer. You specialize in an elite team of rats to eviscerate the enemy, the cat. You have taken the cat hostage, and his fellow beasts havn't payed the ransom for him. All of the rat superiors conclude that the only way to affect the cats is by executing one, so you have to come up with logical methods of killing the cat to show the other beasts what tactical capability Rat Team 6 has. I've completed the game, but I don't want to have spoilers for those who want to get invested into this gem. Anyway, all the rats actions, dialogue, &amp; relationships are amazingly executed, and couldn't be done better. I have to give this section of the game 10/10   3. Cons (if any are plausible) I have a list of cons to this game that I have to share, so here they are. The first one is that the game is way too short, if you're a hardcore birds-eye view shooter like I am. I wish for additional capabilities to difficulty to further lenghten the re-playability of the game. Another con I have is the cats don't have many death animations, and I have a fetish for dead cats developed from this game despite the fact I'm not a furry nor necrophillic.   4. Conclusion  In summary, I have to give this game a 9/10. If you have the low price of 50c or $1, please pick this puppy up from Amazon/Ebay using code Sick Reviews not plugging that company just saying.",

            "review_text": "I woke up this morning, fresh as my mother was before she bore me, and I headed to the kitchen as usual to have my morning cup of cold unfiltered water, then I proceeded to head for the bathroom to brush my teeth for once. Afterwards I returned back to my desk, where you would find my rig, so I proceeded to press the on button as usual.  After a few seconds of waiting; I entered my password (don't tell anyone but it's GabenLife3) and after logging in successfully I clicked on the Steam icon that was pinned on my taskbar and waited for it to load up.  As always, after logging into Steam I always check the store for sales, then it struck me hard in the crevices of my scrotum, I remembered that today was the start of the Winter sale! So since I was a broke ♥♥♥ cunt, I checked to see all the games that were under £4, and I decided to order it from lowest price up. And there I saw it. The legendary Bad Rats, so I thought 'heck, what's with all this commotion with this lil Bad rats dealio?' So I read some reviews but ignored them completely and bought it anyway  because I could .  I let it install. It was a moderate download size of just over 200MB and I downloaded it in no time, so after it was done, I clicked the shiny blue 'Play' button and proceeded to try out the game.  The game is so much fun.  When I saw that sub-480p intro screen I knew that this was going to be a fantastic AAA title. and then the menu screen, oh the menu screen,  oo0ooooooooooo0o0o0o00o0o0o0o0o0o0o0ooo0oo0o00oohhhh the menu screen , It's design was so sleek, it consisted of a what I presume is a pre rendered video of a gangster alleyway with a beautifully rendered feline cat kept in a bird cage, and there were rodents that were trying to pursue the said feline cat with a whole host of different equipment, such as a rat-sized tractor, rat-sized umbrellas, rat-sized vacuum cleaners and rat-sized vest bombs which are based around suicidal terrorist vest which the al qaeda use. All of that really hyped me up to play the game, which I then proceeded to in the very originally designed menu layout which used the background graffiti as the buttons, which also made me even more excited.  When you start the actual game, you are a trancended third person entity that telekinetically picks up objects spawned in for you in order to complete one task, and that task is to kill the possessed demon cat that has stiff joints and randomly laughs in his captivity prison and is consisted of low resolution textures and no more than 80 polygons (Such a monster must be banished immediately). The items that are given to you consist primarily of plywood and terrorists.   You try to lead a football to lightly touch an &lt;object&gt; which in turn kills the demonized cat. The way you do it is by strategically aligning specialized rodents and an assortment of other props and objects and  hopefully  lead the said football to the said killing &lt;object&gt;.  Why did I say hopefully? Well my brethren, I haven't even touched on the perfect physics of this simulator, It's so well implemented that every time you try the same configuration, it ends differently! Just as the laws of physics would work in real life. Definately a 10/10 for that aspect.  Sadly though, I wasn't able to fully explore the entirety of this game as while I was playing I contracted prostate cancer (how strange, not like it's anything to do with this great masterpiece) and now I'm bed ridden and unable to continue my quest in completing this game.    Just kidding, here's how you actually play the game:  -Buy it on sale -Install it -Run it -Alt-Tab out -Wait a while, take a relaxing shower or something -Come back and be delighted that your 3 trading cards have dropped in -Close the game -Uninstall it -Sell off the trading cards for more than what you bought it for -??? -Profit",

            "review_text": "Like all physics-based games, this one is HIGHLY annoying.  But I doubt it's deserving of its unofficial title of 'worst game on steam'. (IDRK at the moment what  my  nomination would be, but it can't be  this .) It's not even close to the worst game, in a technical sense -- there are some games that don't even boot, or are inescapably bug-ridden and crashy. Playing this game for ~2 hrs, I found at least one bug but the key point is that I was  playing  the game for 2 hours -- not every steam game can even boast that much.  BTW I'm a quake fan, hard-core. And some of the cat death animations have this particle blood that goes flying when u kill them which tbh reminds me of quake. So, there u have it: how the 'worst game on steam' manages to associate itself -- in a manner, however tenuous -- with the best game of all time. Seriously. The game without which, steam, or  any of this , might not even be here. There are plenty questionable-quality games on steam which can not make this 'it has this split-second moment where it's a little teeny-weeny eensy-weensy bit like quake' boast, and thus, all other things being equal, are implicitly inferior to Bad Rats. ;P [/srs]  And BTW, lots of the other animations -- like a lot of aspects of this game, arguably -- are in the 'so bad it's good' category (as well as the 'we  all  have bad ideas, but these guys actually went through with theirs; you just have to see it!' category), and I would not be at all surprised to find there is a contingent of people who worship this as the  best  game on steam.  Do I recommend this game? Sorry, but for 10¢ how can I not?  Disclaimer: I'm not a proponent of the animal cruelty, but that's just one of many embarassing political concerns this game would have to deal with if it was ever trying to run for public office. This game has enough going against it; in my review, I'm giving it a pass on all its moral issues. :P  P.S. You (yes, even you!) can get 100% achievements on this game pretty easy. What's not to like, there? :P",

After watching videos of the game 'Air Control', I wasn't sure what to expect. I received the game, then quickly downloaded it.  After half an hour of playing it... I discovered something frightening... I liked it?  So to break it down, this game came out in 2009. Now, my first thought was 'This looks like it came out in 1995.' But to my surprise, it is QUITE a recent title. The framerate is capped at 35fps, and there are extremely limited graphics options as well as almost no resolution options. Will I excuse this? No. Does it completely ruin the game? No, but it's just EXTREMELY dated looking in multiple ways. The person who gifted the game to me also mentioned constant crashing, but that wasn't an issue for me I might add.  The gameplay... Okay, I like it. The different options for creating a working physics contraption are fun. The puzzles are solved in clever, satisfying ways that aren't extremely easy nor really difficult. It's a decent balance. The cat's deaths are also creative, and range from simply being shot, all the way to being microwaved alive. Now that's pretty violent, so your point of view may differ from mine. If you're easily offended by violence, well maybe this isn't for you..  To say the least, the game works. It's not some random unfinished mess of a game that bears to be unplayable. Liking the concept from the start, I came into this game optimistically, and left satisfied.  Now, would I buy this game for the original five dollar price tag it had? Probably not; there are a lot of better five dollar games out there. Do I think it's worth just one dollar? Yeah, perhaps! Maybe if I were really curious, I'd sell Steam inventory items to get the change to buy it.  It's a small, fun, basic game that's probably what you'd expect by looking at it in the Steam store page. Don't be too quick on joining the band wagon.",

But nothing compares to Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge, which cannot be fairly called a game, but rather a portal to another universe. I felt myself immersed in another world, and it's name was Bad Ratia.  When I first stumbled upon the game, I was curious. The graphics were so vivid and lifelike that I often was confused which reality was real. The logo was spoke of a tale of rebellion, of a time where people had to 'stick it to the man' as it were. I knew this would be an instant favorite.  I navigated to my Steam Library and clicked on the ominous looking title, Bad Rats. Excitedly I hurriedly pressed the play button, but I had no idea what I had just set into motion. Immediately my monitor turned black, signaling that the game was about to start. I saw the familiar Bad Rats logo and waited eagerly to play the game. All of a sudden these skulls started appearing, which I assumed was the loading bar, but really represented something deeper. In this harsh world of Bad Ratia, blood covered the streets, and as each skull lit up, I felt myself edging closer to what I assume is death.   Then it happened.  Immediately the beautiful colors of Bad Ratia came into sight, and I knew I was in the game. But what I hadn't realized was that I was IN the game. Yes, the atmosphere, the characters, the story, immediately gripped me. As I played more I felt for the troubles of the Rat and how he struggled to fight the great evil, and how the Rat started a civil war, hoping for better times. Things changed later on when the Rat failed to complete one of the Cats' maniacal puzzles, and he died. I immediately remembered the time my pet rock died, and cried profusely. That's how powerful this game is. Though, Bad Rats isn't all about the struggles of the Rat people, but it also tells a story of redemption and liberty, because even though his life was taken away, another Rat took the lead and replaced him. What a powerful game!   I believe that Bad Rats is the most game in history. Shockingly, Bad Rats tells the story of America and the civil war, but rather comically uses animals to represent the two opponents. And what animals they were! The evil dictators of our world are like the Cats. We can learn a lot from this 'game', oh let me just say what it really is, and that's art. I highly anticipate the sequel of Bad Rats, and anyone wanting to experience, nay, LIVE a story that is worth more than all the money in the world, should buy this piece of art immediately.",

            "review_text": "Bad Rats : the Rats' Revenge, a game often viewed by others as a shallow and tedious. They consider that the game just presents itself as it is; there is no underlying meaning to it, and the lack of depth and devotion necessary to play this game clearly drives many players away.  Indeed, superfically, Bad Rats : the Rats' Revenge seemingly caters to the most lowly and destitute indiviuals; as such, this game is frequently given as a 'troll' gift to many, the giver deciding that it would be fitting to inflict such perceived torture to his/her acquaintance. However, the recipient of the copy of Bad Rats should, in fact, be fairly grateful towards his/her compatriot, if the former does possess a shred of common education. This is because Bad Rats : the Rat's Revenge is, in actuality, a classical demonstration of a gem, a chef-d'oeuvre, a masterpiece shining in a million different colours, buried under a rather large accumulation of unfounded criticism, an ugly, profound shade of coal black.  Although highly debated over its moral concepts, and rightly so, the fundamental insight this game provides to the human nature is astounding and explores many intresting faucets, viewpoints and opinions on society. On closer inspection, then, Bad Rats creates an articfical atmosphere, an euphemistic world where any objects or actions we take are simply metaphors for its psycholoanalysis of the human nature.  George Orwell, the author of 1984, had once depicted a real-life situation that he wished to mock through the use of animals; this came to be his book Animal Farm, a short novel parodying the Russian Revolution. Invent4 Entertainment, the developer of this game, seems to be doing likewise. Although the astheic aspect of Bad Rats seems unrefined, it is undisputable that this is does not interfere with the implicit meaning of this game.  I will not pander my desires to enlighten you on this implicit 'meaning', simply because that there are different interpretations for everyone. Nonetheless, the very fact that you, the player, acting for the rats, have to massacre cats that you have caught as prisoners (as a form of 'revenge') in highly contrived levels should give you a general psychological idea of this game. There are many questions to be asked when confronted with the many situations that you will encounter in Bad Rats, but in all in all, the stark contrast between the cats and rats is surely something to be noted. In our world today as we know it, is it not the cat that hunts the rats? The governement who controls the people? Why is it that Invent4 Entertainment has chosen to show us a seemingly chaotic society where a rebellion was held?  Jean de la Fontaine once said, 'A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it'. The very fact that Bad Rats : the Rats' Revenge depicts cats in cages leads me to wonder : what had the cats done before (if not for the obvious reason of killing the rats), and what is the certain underlying message behind all this? In their question for retribution, the rats show no fear in tactfully harming their own to attain their goals. What could have driven them to such a level of anger that they would kill their own species to harm another? Would that not defeat the very purpose?  In the end, there will always be many irrefutable masterpieces in gaming, such as The Witcher 3, Skyrim, Dark Souls, Half Life, Bioshock, and many, many, many more. Bad Rats : the Rats' Revenge will unfortunately not be part of this elite; perhaps it's meaning was shrouded by the horrible gameplay and unappealing visuals, but for the few that stay to enjoy the philosophical and intellectual discussion that this game provokes, Bad Rats will always have a place underground, a buried gem in our hearts.",

            "review_text": "  The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a double membrane-bound organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms, although some cells in some organisms may lack them (e.g. Red blood cells). A number of organisms have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures.[1] To date, only one eukaryote is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.[2] The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek μίτος, mitos, i.e. 'thread', and χονδρίον—, chondrion, i.e. 'granule'[3] or 'grain-like'. Mitochondria have been described as 'the powerhouse of the cell' because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.[4]  Mitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3μm in diameter[5] but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth.[6] Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes.[7][8] Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders,[9] cardiac dysfunction,[10] heart failure[11] and autism.[12]  The number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. For instance, red blood cells have no mitochondria, whereas liver cells can have more than 2000.[13][14] The organelle is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, the intermembrane space, the inner membrane, and the cristae and matrix. Mitochondrial proteins vary depending on the tissue and the species. In humans, 615 distinct types of protein have been identified from cardiac mitochondria,[15] whereas in rats, 940 proteins have been reported.[16] The mitochondrial proteome is thought to be dynamically regulated.[17] Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own independent genome that shows substantial similarity to bacterial genomes.[18]  The first observations of intracellular structures that probably represented mitochondria were published in the 1840s.[19] Richard Altmann, in 1890, established them as cell organelles and called them 'bioblasts'.[20][19] The term 'mitochondria' was coined by Carl Benda in 1898.[21][19] Leonor Michaelis discovered that Janus green can be used as a supravital stain for mitochondria in 1900. In 1904, Friedrich Meves, made the first recorded observation of mitochondria in plants in cells of the white waterlily, Nymphaea alba[19][22] and in 1908, along with Claudius Regaud, suggested that they contain proteins and lipids. Benjamin F. Kingsbury, in 1912, first related them with cell respiration, but almost exclusively based on morphological observations.[19] In 1913, particles from extracts of guinea-pig liver were linked to respiration by Otto Heinrich Warburg, which he called 'grana'. Warburg and Heinrich Otto Wieland, who had also postulated a similar particle mechanism, disagreed on the chemical nature of the respiration. It was not until 1925, when David Keilin discovered cytochromes, that the respiratory chain was described.[19]  In 1939, experiments using minced muscle cells demonstrated that cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, the concept of the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known.[19] The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.[19]  The first high-resolution electron micrographs appeared in 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the mitochondria.[19] This led to a more detailed analysis of the structure of the mitochondria, including confirmation that they were surrounded by a membrane. It also showed a second membrane inside the mitochondria that folded up in ridges dividing up the inner chamber and that the size and shape of the mitochondria varied from cell to cell.  The popular term 'powerhouse of the cell' was coined by Philip Siekevitz in 1957.[23]  In 1967, it was discovered that mitochondria contained ribosomes.[24] In 1968, methods were developed for mapping the mitochondrial genes, with the genetic and physical map of yeast mitochondrial DNA being completed in 1976.[19]  There are two hypotheses about the origin of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote.[25] In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the most accredited theory at present is endosymbiosis.[25][26]  A mitochondrion contains DNA, which is organized as several copies of a single, circular chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, such as those of the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia.[27] However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.[28]  A recent study[29] by researchers of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the Oregon State University indicates that the SAR11 clade of bacteria shares a relatively recent common ancestor with the mitochondria existing in most eukaryotic cells.  The ribosomes coded for by the mitochondrial DNA are similar to those from bacteria in size and structure.[31] They closely resemble the bacterial 70S ribosome and not the 80S cytoplasmic ribosomes, which are coded for by nuclear DNA.  The endosymbiotic relationship of mitochondria with their host cells was popularized by Lynn Margulis.[32] The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria descended from bacteria that somehow survived endocytosis by another cell, and became incorporated into the cytoplasm. The ability of these bacteria to conduct respiration in host cells that had relied on glycolysis and fermentation would have provided a considerable evolutionary advantage. This symbiotic relationship probably developed 1.7[33] to 2[34] billion years ago.  A few groups of unicellular eukaryotes have only vestigial mitochondria or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae.[35] These groups appear as the most primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA",

            "review_text": "Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio[1] (/dᵻˈkæpri.oʊ/; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor and film producer. In the early 1990s, DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials, after which he had recurring roles in TV series such as the soap opera Santa Barbara and the sitcom, Growing Pains. In 1993, DiCaprio began his film career by starring as Josh in Critters 3, before starring in the film adaptation of the memoir This Boy's Life (1993) alongside Robert De Niro. DiCaprio was praised for his supporting role in the drama What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), and gained public recognition with leading roles in the drama The Basketball Diaries (1995), and the romantic drama Romeo + Juliet (1996), before achieving international fame with James Cameron's epic romance Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing film to that point.  Since 2000, DiCaprio has received critical acclaim for his work in a wide range of film genres. DiCaprio's subsequent films include, The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can (2002), and the epic historical drama Gangs of New York (2002), which also marked his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio was also acclaimed for his performances in the political war thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the neo-noir crime drama The Departed (2006), the espionage thriller Body of Lies (2008), the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the biographical film J. Edgar (2011), the western Django Unchained (2012), and the period drama The Great Gatsby (2013).  DiCaprio's portrayals of Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and Hugh Glass in The Revenant (2015) won him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and his role as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) won him the award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. DiCaprio won his first BAFTA award for Best Actor for The Revenant. DiCaprio has been nominated for six Academy Awards—five for acting and one for producing—and in 2016, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for The Revenant.  In addition to acting, DiCaprio is the founder of his own production company, named Appian Way Productions. DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist.   DiCaprio was born in Hollywood, California,[2] the only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken), a German-born legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comics artist and producer and distributor of comic books.[3] DiCaprio's father is of half Italian (from the Naples area) and half German (from Bavaria) descent.[4][5][6] DiCaprio's maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German.[7] His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken (1915–2008),[8] a German citizen, was born as Yelena Smirnova in Russia.[9][10] In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as 'half Russian' and said that two of his late grandparents were Russians.[11]  DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to Los Angeles.[4] He was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in a museum in Italy when DiCaprio first kicked.[12] His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly with his mother.[13] The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park, and at 1874 Hillhurst Avenue in the Los Feliz district (which was later converted into a local public library), while his mother worked several jobs to support them.[4] He attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years.[14] However, he dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED).[15][16] DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He speaks a little German and Italian.[17][18][19]",

            "review_text": "Simply put, the greatest Smiths album. Locating Morrissey at the peak of his game, with his players surprisingly flexible, The Queen Is Dead did not disappoint when it was finally issued in summer 1986, after a legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed its release from the start of the year.  From the excitement and rush of the title track, which was the Smiths' utmost combination of garage rock assault and music hall to the closing “Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others”, this was the Smiths working tightly as a unit, breaking new ground, with Morrissey taking his moment in the full glare of the limelight to act up accordingly, with puns ever more daring, sexual politics ever more ambivalent, his heart and his art on his sleeve. Johnny Marr obsessively worked on the sound and texture of the music. Together, it proves an irresistible combination.  It’s got hits – “Bigmouth Strikes Again”, “The Boy With The Thorn In His Side”; maudlin ruminations: “I Know It’s Over” (with the line: ‘Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head’); “Never Had No One Ever”; witty interludes “Frankly Mr Shankly” and “Cemetery Gates”. It also contains “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out”, Morrissey’s most poignant lyric, matched superbly by the deftness of the musicianship.  Biographer Johnny Rogan said that with The Queen Is Dead, Morrissey emerged as ‘the most interesting songwriter of his generation’, and it is absolutely true. Few people can switch between high- and low-brow, vulgar comedy and poignant self doubt so convincingly and rapidly over 36 minutes.",

I, quite honestly, don't mind it.  Yes, the game could be improved in quite literally *every* aspect, but I wouldn't want it to. I started off playing this game as a joke, and now I'm addicted to a quality puzzle game.

She was Serenity Serentiy Rider of Flesh towerGlorifica   she was born under the shady dark red moon of the last oktober of the second millenium after the Great ♥♥♥♥.   Her father was the king of all the lands of our kingdom from the Beyond. Her mother was born of the Ferry of Wisdom and Beauty.  Every day Clarisse ware the most beautyfil outfits the worlds have ever seen. Her favourte is a fetishincandesent blue jacket that reaches down to her angles and is decorated with signs of insignia. Clarisse takes long walks at the kingdoms dark forrest where Clarisse is acoompanied by her faithful Jortföljitr (A/N: I got that name after I watched Thor!), her faithful companion ferral dire lionworf.  But one day Clarisse was walking down the beach and then Clarisse saw a great dark light appearing in the middle of the beach. It was great and dark and was everywhere but especially the middle where it was the greatest and darkest of all.   Oh faithful Jortfulljitar! Clarisse said!  Jortfalhitr looked at Clarisse with his great dark eyes and snuffled up to Clarisse in fear and comfort. And growled at the grat Black and Dark lgith. Jortfialjiral was a great and vicious beast Clarisse evaganlised in her head. But Clarisse must have said it out loud because behind her a mysterious voice said Thats indeed a great and vicious beast you have there.  It was Bomber Rat!  Clarisse had heard of Bomber Rat all this time but she had never met his! Clarisse wouldn't have dreamed to actually see that he existed in this dimension! Her father is the king of all the realms and dimensions and he had known that Bomber Rat lived in one of his rears and but it was quite exciting.   But Clarisse cared for none of that. Because when Clarisse saw Bomber Rat, Clarisse was burning in his the great round orbs of his soul that was embedded deeply wthin his head.  After what seemed like many eternitys we were awoken from our mutational dream we were having together. Because.......!! Eyjafjallajökul groelwd once more at the great black thing (it was sort of like a swirly thing, but sworly doesn't quite sound epic so i didn't describe it as swirly. But it knid of is)... and it rapped open!  From within the deepest and darkest earas of the realsm Clarisse saw forthcoming a beast of greatness. It's evilness was radiating from the skins of other beings that it wore and swriwling around its head ( Clarisse thinks it was its head) came forth the souls of the beings that had suffered while it atea them.  Clarisse was flabbergasted. Clarisse reached out from her blue jacket and Clarisse held before more the AllDUst that her mother had enstruated to me so long ago. Clarisse held it before me and spoke the words in the acient Furry Langugae that her mother had taught to me as her mother had taught it to her and hers mother had taught it to her after she had won those words from the Great Dragon JarriJalleJar!  JortFullJarriJalle was a great evil beast that had tomented the lands of her father and her father couln't do anything about it because he was yet still a small child of a boy (her father is really old you see, like the Doctor!)  --- Meanwhile, Bomber Rats mind was wondered back to the past.  It was Bad Cats easter party, which everyone was invited too. The party was awesome as always, because was hosting it.  Bomber Rat was pretty drunk that day.  If Bomber Rat was honest, He couldn't remember much that happened.  Only something about a banana,a rabbi and a traffic cone.  There was one thing that stuck in Him mind though. Something He would never forget. Archer Rat. Archer Rat was wearing a Rocket Rat mask that night   Everyone had come as something or someone else.   ROCKET RAT was dressed as ARCHER RAT. ARCHER RAT was dressed as .  was dressed as Bomber Rat. Bomber Rat was dressed as Bad Cat. And Bad Cat was dressed as a brief history of time by steven hawking.   Bomber Rat was instantly attracted to Archer Rat in Her costume. The way She moved. The way She talked.The way She flicked Her hair. Archer Rat was doing a Karaoke number.  It was '99 red balloons'. And She was awesome. She sung like a true seductor.The audience was miasmarised by Archer Rat.  Underwear was chucked at Archer Rat. Bomber Rat was soooo turned on. (and He didn't need that underwear anyway) Bomber Rat got up and sang too. When Archer Rat was singing 99 red balloons it was like the words spoke to Him. Archer Rat seemed to be addressing each word of the song just to Him. The room faded away and it was just the two of them. No one else in the world. They gazed into eachother eyes as Archer Rat spoke the last lyric. Then silence.  Suddenly, Bomber Rat was woken out of the flashback by the present --- A/N I got bord of writing the fanfic as it was so I decided to change things around. I hope u guys like it!!  She was as of yet the most beautifyl thingy in the whole of Earth, Bomber Rat believed her to be. As she ♥♥♥♥jt the great villianness Bad Cat, her Big boppers bobbed up and down consistantly like someone making love in a car. She swipped sexlyat the Bad Cat and was more than anything Bomber Rat had seen before. Her beatiful feistful pressure shocked Bad Cat's henchmen into copulating before her.   Clarisse, take my sword! said Bomber Rat, and give it to the greatness before us. She will need our legendary sword in order to defeat the great uber-Bad Cat  And lo! Clarisse did so and the maginificent great mysterious woman took the sword and stabbed Bad Cat.  She was defeated. But was Bad Cat? Because as Bomber Rat ran towards the mysterious strange beauty of his draems and was about to share the greatest kiss he(and more) had ever given to someomne in the history of mankind, Bad Cat rose up and fled! --- The next time they saw eachother Archer Rat winked at Bomber Rat, remembering what happened at the party.Bomber Rat blushed. Some of the others giggled. Did they know? Bomber Rat didn't care. ---- --- Bomber Rat had some time before he had to do anything, so He decided to have another flashback.  It was just after the Karaoke. They had stepped of the stage to loud applause and were now looking at eachother. 'Hi' Bomber Rat said, meekly. 'Hay' Archer Rat said, also meekly. Their confidence from moments ago had evaporated like alcohol. 'Do you want too...' 'maybe..' 'ok then.' So they walked to the cloakroom. It wasn't long before their lips were together. Bomber Rat couldn't remember who made the first move.  He did remember the taste though. The taste of Archer Rat. Archer Rat tasted like loquat on a autumn noon. Refreshing and salty but also a bit sour. What had they been eating? Bomber Rat tried to work out it. It took much tung work. After a few minutes mouth to mouth pot holing, Archer Rat guessed what Bomber Rat was doing.  'I had salal berry for lunch.' 'oh' 'you dont have to stop though' 'oh. Good!' Bomber Rat said, with great relief. They finally drew away after what seemed a whole september but was only mere minutes.  The taste of Archer Rat's lips (and other things) still lingered in Bomber Rat's mouth as they finally looked upon each other with new eyes. Relieved sighs came from both of them as both embraced, Archer Rat snuggling against Bomber Rat's neck as he snuggled upto Archer Rat's torso.    Archer Rat went further by clutching Bomber Rat with his fingers, pulling at the fabric of His slacks to feel what was underneath.  The telltale shape in His leggings stood out between them, especially with the weight it had against Bomber Rat's thigh.  Archer Rat moved over Bomber Rat's body like a serpent and lovenly nuzzled at a peaked abbs. Bomber Rat liked this a lot and started making a lot of noise. Archer Rat joined in. 'Owwww...Ahhh...MAHAhhhEEkkk...aakk' It got pretty noisy from that point on. Both of them had a lot of fun and made a lot of noise!. Bomber Rat sounded like Bus ! Archer Rat sounded like a heard of Birdss on drugs.",

It hurt me last year, but I am a stronger person about it. It might be that the person who is doing the cyber-bullying is a 25-year-old man who is living in the basement of his mommies house, or a computer genuis, but if it is either one, they should know that it hurt people. Not only the person who the bullying is for, but others aswell. There are laws about this and the law says that cyber-bullying is jail-time up to 10 years and $5000 fine, plus a record that will live through your life. It is not fully endorsed because it is hard to proof who is doing the cyber-bullying. It is not that hard because of the IP number each computer leaves. Computers are just like thumb prints.

This is not including games I own from other services, console games I currently own, and games owned in the past that are no longer in my posession. I have played thousands of games over the years, and let me tell you something.  Bad Rats is, without a doubt, the single greatest video game I have ever played. Now, I was only able to play for a total of 32 minutes, but those were the best 32 minutes of my entire life. Better than losing my virginity. Better than the first time I ever got intoxicated. Better than the first time I ever fell in love. Better than that time I found Jesus. No sir. In fact, if you took every achievement in human history and combined them together, they would still only measure up to a small fraction of the excellence that is Bad Rats.  It is with great sorrow that I can never play Bad Rats again, for it is so amazing in it's execution that mortal eyes can only behold it's magnificence for so long. It's much like an Elder Scroll, or the Ark of the Covenant. To stare directly at it for too long can only be met with death. This game was touched by God himself, and it shows in the expertly crafted gameplay and amazing audio that only the divine could hope to achieve.  If you do not have Bad Rats forever linked to your Steam account then I am sorry . . .But you are not a real gamer. Nay, I say, you are not even a real human. You have not fully lived until you direct your army of brave mouse warriors to slay the evil cat plague through a series of convoluted death traps. In fact, you should be sacrificing your own children to the Elder God's RIGHT NOW as thanks for this monumental game.  I give this game my full endorsement, now and always. 11/10. Monumental game. So good, much nice. ",

I've only played the first couple of levels, so I dont know whats in store after level 4. But it is really challenging. I give it a 6/10. It could have done much better if graphics were improved, physics tweked here and there, the plan (which you can turn on and off during the game) just LITERALLY tells you what to do. They tell you to be creative. Now I've only played up to level 4 on easy, but if the harder difficulty's allow you to use the plan then damn. What's the point in telling the person playing your game to be creative. Your holding there through the entire game. Now it does get some things right, with the blood, and crude humor.

Bad rats has a amazing range of characters.  Like Rat, and the very malicious. Cat, with these dynamic characters, you've got yourself a fantastic story with endless possiblities.   Bad Rats has a unique chat system, talk to the Cat and convince him to kill himself, but little did you know the reaper implants made him turn into a robotic nightmare. And that was a great plot twist.  This is one of my favourite BioWare games, I think they completely nailed the level design, characters, and the dark and compelling plot.  Let me go over the plot quickly.  So in 1942 a Rat spy spied on the Cat agency in America. The cats were up to something, something to do with cats, and all that good stuff. The rat got flashbacks to when the cats ripped one of his toes off, and hatred was in his eyes.   He went behind the cat and sliced his throat, and then the kitty war began.  Hello Kitty fans and all came along and united to take down the rats. But the rats sent them into a trap, the Hello Kitty fans were tied up into cages put in awkward spots and the rats tried to torture them, and that's where the story stops for now, in the game you torture the Hello Kitty fans.  And with the sequal right around the corner, this is the best time to pick up this 2009 classic!  A must buy!",

Once this occours you can easily make profit from playing the best game imaginable.  BAD Rats is the first ever true multi-genre game on the steam market, being a survival horror, third person shooter, historical, space simulation, RTS, MOBA, Christian Educational Game.  The games plot revolves around trying to teach the consumer about the misconceptions of ebola. Before i played this game i was under the impression that ebola wasn't in my country but i now know that it in fact has infected the global population through airborne transfer. It also teaches you that you can cure ebola by bathing in honey and then applying peanut butter. Fantastic  Pros- -Amazing Graphics -Revolutionairy Mechanics -Outstanding PVP gamemodes -Servers have 100% uptime. This game has the best co-op imaginable  Cons- -Some levels where co-designed by the anti-christ and are impossible to beat without a walkthrough -Completely unoriginal concept clearly stolen from the groundbreaking game DOTA 2 -Character progression has too many items and is therefore impossible to understand -Some graphics stolen from well known games such as pong and realm of the mad god -The 'bad rats puzzle gun' is actually just a rat that uses the portal gun from the famous game portal 2 and the mechanic is glitchy -The tutorial is absolute crap (actually tho) it doesn't teach you 99% of the game mechanics. -In the credits they leave out the obvious inspiration from star wars episode 3, a new home.  So, i was going to give this game a healthy 9/11 but then i realized the absolute misfourtune of this game. After you have played this game you will lose the ability to play any game besides bad rats. Due to this unfortunate compulsion I will have to rate this game 0/10 while i go ddos the multiplayer servers to save the poor souls suffering from christian educational game addiction.   I hope this review was helpful and please click the yes if you liked it :)",

Even restarting a level, doing the same thing you did before restarting said level, will result in a different outcome. The game becomes more trial and error than solving actual puzzles or understanding the game's logic.  Aside from the gameplay, I can also not recommend this game based on the music (which, for me, gets annoying and repetitive like a midi loop), as well as the inclusion of some offensive stereotypes on the rats to tell what their effects are. The most notable being the bomb rat that blows itself up.  All around the game is not an enjoyable experience, and not worth the dollar.",

I'm pretty sure anyone who played this game had at least 10 problems with it.  With that in mind, let's talk about why Bad Rats sucks. Just like everyone else.  For one, the sound effects are terrible. They sound like sound bites taken off of someone's website for free. And the constant metallic guitar playing over the gameplay, forced me to turn the game on mute, and play some Queen over it.  But that didn't stop the graphics from looking damned horrid. These graphics are early 2000's levels of quality. And that wouldn't bother me as much, if the poor textures and coloring looked like someone just vomited ugly colors are the characters and backgrounds.  The game is around getting a ball to a trap (which varies between six different types of traps) that a cat has always conveniently positioned themselves under. But... why a ball? A rat could easily walk up to the doohickey and activate it. Why a ball?  Along with that, the game is based around momentum and gravity puzzles, but because the physics are so poorly integrated, you'll often have to restart your test, in case the ball didn't land where it was supposed to. And it's hard to tell when you've messed up or when the game messed up. So, I'll just call it a draw, and say that the developers messed up.  I'd actually say that the game is elevated to a 'good bad game'. Manhunter is still my #1 good bad game, but Bad Rats really takes the cake, taking what could be really monotonous gameplay, and makes it some of the stupidest sh** you've ever seen. Whether a rocket rat hits and offensive Muslim stereotype rat and they explode, or one rat will just keep hitting the wall with his bat.  It's ESPECIALLY hilarious, when you see how the developers designed the be all end all solution to the puzzle, and it fails spectacularly because the game's physics are so crappy.   I'm not recommending this game to anyone out there wanting a quality game. Just look at the reviews. Look at the advertizing. It's garbage. Don't buy it. However, I'm giving it a soft recommend to anyone looking to play a good bad game. I'd consider Manhunter to be something like 'The Room', but Bad Rats is the insane nonsensical equal to 'Baby Geniuses'. I'm giving this game a well-deserved 2/10.",

It is, however, 79p at full price. You can't make that back in cards unless you get really lucky.  Let me start by saying that being released in 2009 is no excuse for a game as poor as this. Command &amp; Conquer: Generals was released in 2003, 6 years before Bad Rats, and had far better sound and graphics. This says a lot about the game. The sounds are just extremely annoying, with a few that are even as painful as scratching nails along a blackboard. The physics on dismembered limbs goes haywire, sending them pinging off or spinning endlessly on the spot, as though on wet ice. The animation is also somewhat poor, with the looped animations for non-moving entities being jerky at the end of each loop, as well as being hyper-exaggerated.  The gameplay is not enjoyable. It's a mindnumbing game that bores the hell out of you. The cat's death at the end of a run, while meant to be the moment where you say 'that was worth the effort' is, most certainly, not worth the effort. The sheer awfulness of this game is only funny for half an hour at most before it becomes a drag. The way in which you get each rat or object is sub-par, with you having to pan down to a very narrow area at the bottom of the screen where everything is. There are only two difficulty levels, though they are misnamed. I'll give you the more accurate names: Lazy - it shows you where you need to put everything. It literally takes the game away from you by showing you how to solve the puzzle for every level the moment you open it. Confusing - no more guidance with the ol' spoilers from them, but you get every object available. You can imagine how much of a cluster**** it is down there.  Please, for the sake of keeping games good, spend your 79p elsewhere.",

The game plot is centered on the player, a rat, making a 'Rube Goldberg' machine to kill the enemies, the cats.  The game looks like it was made in the 1990's, which for this type of game is not a problem, but it seems more like laziness on the developers part rather than a nod to nostalgia. Performance wise, the entire game runs like it is underwater. Everything is slow and slower.   To sum it up, I feel like I am playing the first draft of a five year old's first design on a point and click game-maker program.  Being buggy, ugly and slow give this a 1 out of 10.  If you want a good 'Rube Goldberg' machine type of game, spend your money on 'The Incredible Machine' line of games and you will have a much better experience.",

Without changing any of the setup, simply clicking the play button twice in a row produces different results, and in some cases the 'original solution' fails to work.  I really liked the concept, it seemed at first to be well thought out (mechanics wise, the cartoon violence against the cat seemed out of place) but the glitches pile up quickly. Working with the plank becomes a nightmare and, in a very poor design choice, the game will not let you have an object in a 'bad position' as it calls it. I obviously understand a plank or barrel can't be clipping upon starting the level, but there were instances where I could not complete my initial design simply because I could not find a way to negotiate the wooden plank into position. Let the items be in a bad position and only preform the check upon me clicking the play button so I can get the item close, then turn / reposition to not clip.   Overall, this game had potential, but a host of bugs make it nearly if not completely unplayable at the higher levels. I only recommend this if it goes on super sale again (less than $.20 USD) purely because you can turn a profit by idiling it, but that's about it.",

While conceptually this game has strong merit, it falls apart entirely in execution. Bat Rats very much gets to the point of 'I don't know how to do this', but not in the ways a puzzle game should. The challenge is not in the puzzles themselves, but in the execution, of which the players has some control, but not enough. There is a '3rd' dimension of kinds in this 2D puzzle scape, which the player can not effect, but the main piece of every puzzle, the ball, can roll in and out of. This makes for a frustrating game for all the wrong reasons. I would call this 'fake difficulty' created by unfun and unpredictable attributes. This game does not have any saving graces in the graphics department either. The models are of very low quality, and the textures are little to none. Objects, even still ones, clip through each other and the background. It's not much to look at. There isn't much to say achievement-wise either. The goals are lack-luster, though they all do focus on actual gameplay, which is something I'm grateful for when I see it in a game. Over-all, I would not recommend spending 99 cents on this game unless frustration and irritability are what you're looking for. Go buy some Steam Cards instead, you crazy kid!",

            "review_text": "Do you know that moment, when a Steam Holiday Sale is going on and your shopping cart is just 1-2 Euros away from getting you an additional trading card and you don't want it go to waste and are in search for a cheap, funny game, just for the sake of this card. Well, that's the reason for me why I have this failure of code in my library. Bad Rats is a game about Rats who finally taking revenge on their mortal enemies, Cats.  Gameplay  The Game consists of thirty levels where you need to construct a Rube-Goldberg-Mashine for just frying a cat in a microwave. The gameplay is quite similar to the crazy mashines series. Your Construction Material consists of several rats with different abilities, some platforms, and a few grates and tank as basis for the platforms. The rats uses baseball bats, circus cannons, smoak from cigarettes, and one is even dressed as suicide bomber. With that collection of wierdiness you try to put your physics lessons from school into something useful. And that brings me to the major problem of this game. Physics. Broken. Completely. Well, most of the time simple things, like hitting a baseball, will work, but the bigger constructs get some serious problems with it. This is a game, not real life, so you expect that your construction will yield the same results everytime you start it, as long as you don't change anything. Well, not here my friend. Usually, the result (and even some stuff in the middle of the construct) will be different, and sometimes completely unexpected. For Example, your ball can, with not enough motion, decide to just stop and roll on a z-axis right over the 4th wall, wich is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t since such a movement isn't used anywhere else and the ball could slowly roll to it's destination. Especially frustrating if you try to follow a walkthrough. But not only that, I have seen steam pipes, which are set by the game itself, that get activated at different times on each try, screwing up your entire construction. But, oh well, you somehow get used to it, smashing your head on the desk and try it again. Take a look at the video from Pode's Video and see what I mean.
