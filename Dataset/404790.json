            "review_text": "I've using Godot for months, for prototyping or finish the game, it's definitely the great tool to use.  However, the user interface need time to get used to, and the interface was actually changed much since 1.1, if you're a new user, you're lucky as the current interface is more user friendly.  This Engine should be in your Steam database, as one day you suddenly want to make a game, this is a completely free and powerful tool worth a try.",

To say it's easy to use would do the software an inustice, but it is intuitive and easy to get to grips with on a basic level. It's nodes utility runs as if you are using Unreal or Unity, and there is roo for coding, as long as you can utilize python, which to all intents and purposes is a simple language to get used to. If you want drag and drop with minumnm coding, yeah it can do that but don't expect the best game ever without a little effort. It ranks as a very powerful tool, and really pushed my descion making into upgrading fro RPGMaker MV to Gamemaker. Godot Engine won me over, and best of all, it was free to purchase. With a little more work and learning I pray I can make the best adventure for you in my upcoming game in progress, Subworld.",
