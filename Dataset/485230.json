            "review_text": "After playing with it and reading some other's posts, the room-scale issue I originally complained about is mainly fixed with recentering. For the Vive it is supposed to be the grip buttons, but I could not get that to work. I used a gamepad to do it, even though a gamepad is not listed on the store page as being supported.  Also, the left and right hand switch when entering the game, which is not good. Tried it several times and rebooted my system, and every time it switched hands. It's a little unnerving when your thumbs are pointing the wrong way!  Graphics are amazing, however, so I really hope they fix the issues and if it becomes more polished, this will absolutely be a recommended game.",
