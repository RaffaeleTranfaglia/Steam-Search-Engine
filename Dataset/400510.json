Why doesn't she leave when she sees the first monster? Or, hell, when she sees the hospital is outright creepy and abandoned?   Why does the male protagonist look at a camera through a camera?   Whilst I don't think the voice acting is bad, it is out of place.   Pros :   Cool first chapter, but... (see cons)   Interesting overall ambiance   2$   Cons :   Too short (Half an hour)   Too easy   Pretty lazy, one enemy per level, and they will follow you everywhere   Poor sound effect variation   Poor man's Slender Man (but much less challenging)   Story  ",

            "review_text": " The Final Take  is a very short survival horror game that borrows elements from the found footage film genre. It follows the story of a young girl that arrives at an empty, abandoned hospital for a job interview. There she finds a television set and VCR which then continues the story through a flashback.   While the overall presentation is inspired by horror flicks such as  The Blair Witch Project  and  V/H/S , the VCR tracking effect is very overwhelming with a light tint barely lighting the gameplays darkness. With grain and static scrolling through your screen, it's all very rough on the eyes and at times disorienting. I personally own hundreds of VHS tapes, and none look this bad. Also, considering the gameplay asks players to run around open environments looking for pictures while a wailing ghost follows, it all becomes very cheap, very fast.  For about two dollars  The Final Take  isn't too much of a loss. It has it's own achievements and trading cards, but other than that, it is simply another indie dud.",

I finished chapter 1 in around 5-10 minutes and this is all the game had to offer me:  -very cheap jumpscares -annoying crawling monster with bad AI chasing me(very slowly, wasn't even a challenge evading it) -almost no sound effects (all I could hear was my running and THAT didn't even work at points!) -cliche hospital setting, I cannot tell you how many indie horrors use this  Steer clear of this one, unless you want the generic crappy indie horror experience, except your paying for this one. Don't take it as I'm saying 'all indie horror games are bad', this one is just a perfect example of what not to do when making one.  It's a shame, I truly love horror games, and wanted to love this one, but was able to make my decision within 10 minutes. Quite sad and disappointing...",

Remings of all the found footage movies and even a little bit of escape rooms experiences.   It will suck you in and you'll probably finish it in one go... it's not the longest one, but for less then $2 it's definitely worth every single penny!",
