            "review_text": "When I first heard of Garden Rescue, I got excited as I love Tower Defence games. However, I was quickly disapointed when I found out Garden Rescue brings no new aspects to the Tower Defence Genre with 90% of its features/ideas/towers etc seeming as though they were stolen from Plants vs Zombies. Hence, I can't really recommend buying and playing this game and I will let you know fully why I can’t via the detailed pros and cons below.  Pros: ♦ Graphics and style of the game is awesome ♦ Sound effects are great ♦ Each level has a unique path  ♦ Good number of upgrades for progressing throughout the game (This keeps the game interesting) ♦ Easy Achievements with a little bit of Grinding (Easy game to 100%)  ♦ Awesomely detailed book about the Towers, Bugs (Enemies) and Levels ♦ Probably get your money’s worth (I say probably as it's fairly long, though read my con about game length) ♦ Three Star Concept is great ♦ Cheap   Cons: ♦ Repetitive (Gets to a certain point and it's just the same thing over and over again) ♦ Doesn't bring anything new to the Tower Defence Genre ♦ Feels as though the Devs just played Plants vs Zombies and copied most of its key aspects with changing Zombies to Bugs and making the game Path Based (This is evident such as Lawn Mower concept being the same as PvsZ, Plants giving coins is the same as Sunflowers giving Sun in PvsZ, Towers having 3 upgrades which is the same as PvsZ, the first tower you get directly copies the PvsZ PeaShooter, the level where you don't need coins to buy towers and randomly get given a tower is the same as one of PvsZ minigame level. There are many many more examples of how they copied PvsZ but there are too many too list.) ♦ The levels/the rate the enemies come out feels really slow even when you press the 3x speed button (This is really annoying as you sit there with nothing to do just waiting which bored me in some levels) ♦ Variety of Towers could have been better (Too many Ground Towers, not enough Air Towers and the Harden/Defence Tower was useless) ♦ Game offers Tips, however it seems to only have one tip which keeps appearing unless you turn them off (This is annoying as I personally think if there is a tip system there should be more than one tip...) ♦ When the level is paused, upgrade icons don’t go away from certain plants (This is annoying if you pause the game and then upgrade something before unpausing some plants upgrade indicator don't disappear) ♦ No incentive to play on Harder Difficulties (There are three difficulties and no matter which one you use they all feel the same, except there may be slightly more health on the Bugs and there is nothing really unique about each difficulty to make you want to play the game on a Harder or Easier Difficulty)  ♦ The last level seems stupid (The Devs seemingly have just spammed bosses into one annoying level making it near impossible to 3 Star compared to any other level in the game which was quite easy to 3 Star) ♦ No Storyline (This is terrible as it gives you even less incentive to play on as there is no aspect of wanting to know what happens next. Also when you finish the game on any difficulty it just shows credits which annoyed me as the last level is ridiculous in difficulty compared to the others) ♦ No replay value (I say this as there is only 30 levels and once you beat them there is no incentive to do them on different difficulties except one achievement and there is no new worlds, minigames or anything unlocked for beating the game to give it more replay value and make you want to keep playing the game) ♦ Could easily find a Tower Defence of this Calibre for free on Miniclip or a Flash Game Website   On a whole there are way more negatives than positives and as the game feels as though the Devs ripped off 80% of the games aspects/content from Plants vs Zombies without bringing anything new to the Tower Defence Genre and also having no replay value whilst feeling like a free flash game from Miniclip means I can’t really recommend for anyone to buy this game even though it is cheap, works and you will get a few grinding hours out of it. Thus, I also wouldn't recommend this game if you are looking for a Unique Tower Defence that brings something different to the Genre with high replay value as this has none of those aspects as it’s all been done before. Lastly, IMO this game was a boring, slow grind to get to the end just to get 100% of the achievements as you need to 3 star all the levels to get 100%.  *Note: The only reason I’d recommend buying this game would be if you want a quick (3 hours is what it took me… which is quicker than most games), easy game to get 100% of the Achievements to help boost your Steam Profile*",

            "review_text": "Why is it that every time developers make games, they make it fun and playable for the first few levels and then after that throw you straight in to the deep end of hardcore gaming, which I am not a fan of. Also, how the hell do you upgrade anything, at the end of levels, it says an upgrade is available, but I have found no way to actually do an upgrade!!!",

            "review_text": "Yet another tower defence game, this time it's called 'Garden Rescue'.  I can't help but notice the game must be inspired by 'Plants vs. Zombies', but instead of zombies you're battling bugs.  Garden Rescue looks cute and is fun to play, it basically does everything right being a tower-defence game... but it also does not bring anything new to the table. The game is cheap, but then again there are a lot of free browser tower-defence games that offer the same.   It's a fun game but based on those facts, I cannot recommend it...",
