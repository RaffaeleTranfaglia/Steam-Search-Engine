            "review_text": "I HIGHLY recommended Gemini Rue for anyone who's looking for an old fashioned point and click adventure, with challenging but fair puzzles, and a fantastic story.  Everything about the game's presentation is absorbing. It has an old film noir, Sci-Fi Blade Runner feel to it with gorgeous artwork that feels retro and fresh at the same time. The premise and feel reminds me of a story straight out of Cowboy Bebop, with twists that anyone paying attention to should enjoy. Voice acting and music (very moody and dark ambiance), was also spot on.  I really found the puzzles engaging as well. A lot of point and click adventure games I have trouble getting into simply because their 'gameplay' is either much too easy or just too vague in telling me what I am exactly supposed to be doing. I didn't think Gemini Rue had this problem. There were puzzles that were easy solve, and others I had to think about for long minutes before coming up with an answer. The Easter Eggs and achievements spread throughout the game was also a plus for me.  The only problem I had with the game was the fact that it felt too short, and that after all is said and done, the characters are technically confined to two basic areas throughout the whole game when I wished there had been more to explore... But honestly the game did take me quite a bit of time to beat, and as for the lack of a wider world, I just enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end. ",

The non-linear gameplay, while understanding it's purpose, is not my cup of tea - I simply played the section I was on until the game swapped me to the next segment. I enjoyed this game, it's my favourite genre and reminded me of the old school Lucasarts games that I grew up with (especially Beneath a Steel Sky) so it had a nostalgic feel. However I do have one huge gripe - name me another pointandclick with a combat system? ... Can't think of one? There's a *reason* for that - because it doesn't work! The combat is annoying, ungainly, ruins the atmosphere and adds nothing to the overarching themes of identity and what makes us who we are. If you are looking for an original adventure with a good story, try this one but do yourself a favour and put the combat on easy to save yourself a headache.",

For good because it stylistically fits right beside games like Rise of the Dragon, Dreamweb and Beneath a Steel Sky. It’s nice to see the style be kept alive.  Unfortunately the game also plays like a 90s adventure game. The controls and interactions are clunky, with none of the streamlining you’d see in newer games. Something as simple as getting up on a box and climbing a ladder involves 4 clicks and 2 keyboard commands, sometimes even more.  The story almost pulls off what it’s trying to do. In terms of mood there’s nothing wrong with it. The music, sound and visuals work together well. The problem lies with the dialog, which especially towards the end don’t deliver as strongly as it needed to. It’s so close, just another few editing passes might have done it. It doesn’t ruin it, it just stumbles across the finish line. I thought the conceit of the story was done ok. It’s not the best take on the concept, as I thought Dollhouse for example did it much better. But I thought it was alright for what it is.  The game isn’t a must play. It's good, but not as brilliant as it could have been. But if you feel like playing something that's 90s style, this will deliver, pixel hunting and all.",

Fans of old Sierra and Lucasarts games will feel right at home.  The atmosphere can be summed up in one word: oppressive. Rarely have I felt so unwelcome - which is good! The music and sound design are top-notch. However, the voice acting sometimes seems to be a bit flat. The pixelated (but by no means ugly) graphics definitely are a throwback to the 'golden age' of adventure games. Don't let them discourage you, the visuals aren't everything. The combat is clunky, but generally not a huge bother.  It's the puzzles that make an adventure game. In Gemini Rue they're very intuitive and neither too easy nor too hard. Some of them can even be solved in multiple ways, which I felt was a nice touch and shows how much thought was put into making this game. A developer commentary is included, giving further insight into the authors' minds. There are some visual bugs, but nothing gamebreaking.  Overall a very enjoyable game, even if you're not a fan of the genre. Definitely worth the price tag.",

Very Beneath a Steel Sky-esque, with a hint of Full Throttle (I'm not even sure why, but some parts of GR reminded me of some parts of FT). I really liked Gemini Rue.  It is not exempt from a few shortcomings: the controls and interface kinda suck, combat is God awful (not even sure why they felt the need to include combat at all: it really feels out of place), everyone relevant lives in the same one condo, there are not that many locations in the game.  But the good stuff vastly surpasses those. The atmosphere is just great, the visual design is excellent (hand-drawn, visible sketch lines, watercolour-y backdrops, big pixels for character sprints), the story flows well and the dialogue is quite well-written. The plot 'twist' is introduced/hinted decently, and the 'converging stories' device is also used fairly well. The music and voice acting also are top notch.  Overall, Gemini Rue feels old school as ♥♥♥♥, in every respect: it is a greatly atmospheric and utterly enjoyable game that would have worked perfectly in 1994 as it does now. ",

Storywise it's up there with the very best of sci-fi gaming, with plenty of mystery, intrigue and plot twists where you least expect them. It's very beautiful to look at, in a VGA sort of way....and the sound design is top notch too. I know some people didn't care for the voice acting but it seemed fine to me. Even if the 'grizzled hardboiled' protagonist sounds like Harvey Fierstein imitating Marlon Brando :D  Unfortunately the interface is needlessly cumbersome. Rather than, say, left-click to look and right-click to use like the aforementioned Sky which they so liberally borrow from, you have to right-click, choose which part of your body you want to use to interact with an item and then click on it. It gets even more complicated when you gain a sidekick and have to drag them around in the same way. If you come across a ladder, do you use your foot or your hand on it? Actually, either works, but why give us the choice? 'Use' really should be context-appropriate nowadays as most of the choices the player is given are either stupid (You're not going to use your mouth on the ladder) or don't matter (hand or foot works)....  Oh, points also deducted for introducing a needless real-time combat system. Adventure games don't need real-time combat. I thought we learned this with Harvester, Blade Runner, Maddog Williams....at least Full Throttle let you skip the arcade sections if you didn't want to do them....",

As it is expected, you explore the environment and interact with people and objects in order to solve puzzles and eventually proceed. There is also an item called the communicator which lets you communicate with various characters throughout the game but also provides you with all the necessary information and mission status.  You play the role of a man named Azriel who was an ex assassin but now has left his past behind him and works as an officer against the organized crime which is run by a mafia-like group called the Boryokudan. Your formal mission is to aid a man who later helps you on your true mission which is to acquire information about your lost brother Daniel. After infiltrating the Boryokudans and reaviling that there is a secret facility where people are sent there to have their memory whipped out and re-trained to become criminals and that your brother was sent there, you gather your crew and set a new mission, rescuing your brother.   The storyline despite being short is quite compelling and there are nice twists at the end as expected. The overall theme of the game is nicely expressed through the art style with retro like graphics and atmospheric music. However, I would really prefer it if instead the 16 bit overlay the visuals were a little more detailed. In comparison, the audio quality is really impressive for being an indie game. The audio logs are rich and clearly there was put a lot of effort into it. So, the audio and visuals are not side by side in my opinion.   All in all, Gemini Rue is a solid adventure game following the steps of the classic ones, yet it feels fresh and modernized. All friends of the adventure genre should definitely try out this game.",

For a game that makes a big deal about free will, it's kind of ironic that there are literally no choices to be made, no story branches, nothing that you can do that will affect the plot in the slightest. At least most of the visuals are nice.   The puzzles are mostly pretty straightforward once you acquire the necessary items and information, but there's a lot of plodding around just picking up random crap wondering where it will come in handy. There are maps of a city that you're in for much of the game, but you can't even explore most of what it shows- you're a cop chasing leads, and literally everyone lives in TWO apartment buildings.  The game is also plagued by some serious bugs, which for some users could prevent them from running it at all, or cause crashes that prevent further progress. It took me quite a bit of research just to get it running, and then a lot of trial and error to get past one such bug, but I did manage to make it to the end. Not particularly glad I did.

Also do not use the high quality sprite shading, it scales the sprites to a resolution that doesn't match the surrounding environment and it looks out of place.  Tip two: make sure to check every detail in a scene when you're stuck, usually the clue is right there.",

Other issues are the typical point&amp;click issues like cryptic riddles or random combination of item, or the random order of actions which have to take place, which is luckily not thaaaat bad in GR, but still annoying.

            "review_text": " Gemini Rue is an old-school point and click adventure game with some action elements. The game has an involving story and unusually good use of pixelated retro graphics but is somewhat on the easy side.  The game is set in a dystopian future and features a story that starts our mysterious and gradually reveals more about what is going on. The story has philosophical aspects touching on the relationship between memories and personal identity although it doesn't really explore the subjects in any great detail. The story is the best aspect of the game and is helped by the fact that there are two branches of the story unravelling at the same, the two of which later converge. I found the story very appealing and it kept me wanting to keep playing to find out what would happen.  The pixelated graphics suit the atmosphere of the game very well and the visuals are nicely done. I think pixelated graphics have been overused in recent times, but here they are used to good effect.  Sound effects are adequate but nothing special, voice acting on the other hand is considerably above average and matches the personalities of the characters well.  The actual gameplay is the weakest aspect of the game. Puzzles are somewhat bland, not all that creative and mostly a bit too easy. The action sequences are nothing special and don't add much to the game. You could perhaps argue that in a strongly story driven game like this, having easy puzzles may be a good thing, as harder puzzles would only be frustrating when you want to make progress to find out how the story continues. Whether or not you accept that arugment I think that the somewhat lackluster gameplay pulls the game down a bit and keeps it from being the really great game that it could have been.  All in all this is a highly recommended game for all point and click adventure enthusiasts, ar least if you think a good well-told story is at least as important as good gameplay.",

As with any adventure game worth its salt, the game draws you in with an engaging story, a rich cyberpunk atmosphere, and a fitting Bladerunner/Noir-style soundtrack. The game play is your typical point and click with puzzles that compliment the story instead of just being obtuse puzzles for the sake of having puzzles. The user interface and inventory management is very user friendly and doesn't require copious amounts of mouse waving and clicking. The game will roughly last you 4-6 hours depending on how puzzle-saavy you are.  If you do plan of purchasing Gemini Rue, I highly reccomend you play with the voices turned off your first time through. Some characters can come off as very stilted and cheesey and can take away from an otherwise immersive experience. Unless you absolutely cannot stand reading in games, the voices are best left to the imagination.",

The best part is that I could play the game with only using a few hints - usually I can't finish adventure games without using a ton of hints or a walkthrough and that ruins the experience for me.  The only downside is that it's not a very long game, this game leaves me wanting more...  I have two tips for any new players. Tip one: play this game using the highest Nearest Neighbor scaling that supports your monitor resolution, to keep the blocky pixelated look. Also do not use the high quality sprite shading, it scales the sprites to a resolution that doesn't match the surrounding environment and it looks out of place.  Tip two: make sure to check every detail in a scene when you're stuck, usually the clue is right there.",

The second part is the well executed conclusion of both of those stories.  The setting and ambience fit the overall theme very nicely, and the game does well in making you care for what happens to the characters.  The rare combat sequences are fun and don't feel, as one might fear in a point &amp; click adventure, out of place at all. The soundtrack and voice acting is great too.

The puzzles are easy, the combat is quite thrilling for a point-and-click, and the art style is basic - though it performs admirably.  This is one of the better games of recent times that has had puzzle elements and exploration, and its narrative was deserving of a $60 Triple-A title.  I highly encourage anyone who can look past the basic graphics to enjoy the game! Enjoy a world of sci-fi through a personal adventure of characters Azriel Odin and the unfortunate Delta-Six both. Explore a world of advanced technology that drives one to question humanity and experience.

What caught my eye in the trailer for it was a very atmospheric and cinematic game. Despite some bugs that may take some googling to get around, the game seems to deliver on those advertised aspects. I'm suprised at how engaging the voice acting can be and the general moodiness it puts you in.   The gun combat isn't that great, and in some stealth scenarios it's not very intuitive that the enemy could see you from such a distance, but I think the game allows for enough trial-and-error that it doesn't get in the way of the better parts of the experience.  The writing and atmosphere of the game are great. The graphics are a little dated, but that might be the aesthetic the devs were going for. Higher resolution options would have been a welcome addition. The game's story is interesting and engaging. Some of the game interactions may be a bit buggy or unintuitive for today's audiences, but gamers that are very familiar with the quirks of point-and-click adventure games will feel right at home.",
