It really needs a big update. I don't recommend it in a current state.",

            "review_text": "Yury is not game for everyone who doesn't like a hardcore difficult platformer games. At first time, I want to cry &amp; become rage because of death so many times. And the worst part are sloopy control, that can make slip out the platform easily. But if you can managed the control, its become playable. Well, the control is not one of the hardest part. The other one is the first phase of the game.  From my experience, this game can be divided become 3 phase :  Phase 1 (Journey from the surface to the bottom of the planet underground)  This phase can make people anger &amp; rage quit because it's very difficult. Yury can't kill the alien, only jump &amp; dodge the trap and reach the other platform. And be wary of spike trap. When you touch it, you lose the oxygen and then you can die. The only way to finish this phase is going down to the bottom. In my first playthrough, I'll death 250 times in this phase.  Phase 2 (The Action Time)  Once you get the bottom, and got the weapon. The game become easy, but not an easy enough. Yury can shoot the enemy and kill it with one bullet. In this phase, the gameplay become enjoyable and fun. There is no hardcore platforming trap &amp; jump like the first phase that can make you die a lot. And at the final of this phase, you meet the boss. Its easy enough to kill if you learn the pattern. Btw, in my first playthrough I'll death 50 times in this phase.  Phase 3 (Going Surface &amp; Escape The Planet)  When you managed kill the boss. The gravity of this planet become low. This can make you jump higher &amp; higher. And this phase is the easiest part of the game. The only mission is going to surface and find what he looking for before going home. In this phase, I'll death 4 times in my first playthrough.  PROS   + hardcore gameplay + soundtrack + game design &amp; concept is good as the retro game + old-school retro &amp; minimalist graphic + the game becoming more fun if you managed got the weapon  CONS  - control are teribble - sloopy platform   Well, Yury is the hardcore dificult platformer with sloopy control that you can hate or enjoy. I'll recomend this game if you want a real challange &amp; love the old-school games.",

            "review_text": "Just because you're hitting a lot of failure states doesn't mean the game is difficult. Here to demonstrate is  Yury . Abhorrent physics, extremely dodgy collision detection, and constant leaps of faith ensure that you will die many times over the course of this game, and yet very few of those deaths will actually be your fault. Top that with grating, repetitive music, bland 'retro' graphics, and a hideous scanline filter, and you have a game that is most assuredly not worth two dollars.",

The game has various sections where you jump platforms, avoid enemies and traps, shoot, or do all the same time! It has a well made level design. The retro soundtrack is also great and suits the game!  Yury is an exercise of patience and dedication: you must learn the patterns of the areas and the behavior of the enemies, and mainly learn to control the character. His movements are slippery and hard to control, and most of the time you have to do precise and fast jumps.   The character will die a lot, in many ways, and it's very frustrating sometimes, but you need to be persistent! I must say that every time you reach a checkpoint you feel a combination of joy and relief!   If you are searching for a challenge, give this game a try!   Review em português:  Yury é um jogo interessante, um ótimo game retrô hardcore de plataforma!  O jogo tem várias seções onde você deve pular plataformas, evitar inimigos e armadilhas, atirar, ou fazer tudo ao mesmo tempo! Ele tem um 'level design' bem feito. A trilha sonora retrô também é ótima e combina com o jogo!  Yury é um exercício de paciência e dedicação: você deve aprender os padrões das áreas e o comportamento dos inimigos e, principalmente, aprender a controlar o personagem. Seus movimentos são escorregadios e difíceis de controlar, e na maioria das vezes você terá que dar saltos precisos e rápidos.   Seu personagem irá morrer muito, de muitas maneiras, e isso é muito frustrante algumas vezes, mas você precisa ser persistente! Devo dizer que toda vez que você chegar a um checkpoint, você sentirá uma combinação de alegria e alívio!  Se você está à procura de um desafio, tente este game!",

Every progress you made here is not due to your skill but how lucky you get because of really bad controlls. This game tries to feel like retro game but I just don't get it. If you wanted to buy this game to test yourself on some hard platformer challenge then give up. There are more games than enough like that.",

            "review_text": " Yury  is a superb specimen of the neoretro platformer genre, and it stands a very good chance of becoming a perfect one if Cubic Pie continues tweaking it. The game possesses all the qualities of any hardcore 8-bit classic: high difficulty which emphasizes skill instead of grinding or hoarding items, diverse and thoughtfully designed obstacles, and short length. Because  Yury  is hard and brief, it tempts you to assay it over and over again to see just how efficient you can get. Highly recommended, especially at this absurdly low price!",
