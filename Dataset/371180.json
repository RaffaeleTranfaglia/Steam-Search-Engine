Wolfenstein 3D is still one of my favorite games, so I was excited to have a chance to play another game that used its engine. Its goofy novelty may wear off soon for some of you, but I really enjoy it. If you want an old shooter but need guns, you can always try the fine Blake Stone series as well.  The only cons of the game are the weapons that obscure the screeen and the repetition of the enemies. For some reason it is more pronounced than Wolf3D (I could buy the armies of Nazi soldiers all looking the same) but for a game that offers biblical quiz sections, it's odd seeing hundreds of one type of animal.",

S3DNA is a Wolfenstein 3D clone, and before I say anything more, I feel like I should start with:  it's actually not bad . In fact, it's pretty decent. If you like Wolfenstein 3D, that is. And I do! Very much.  All the animals on the ark have grown roudy. As Noah, it's up to you to feed them all (or as many as you have to until you've beaten the six bosses, anyways) so that they'll go to sleep. In order to streamline this process, you'll be shooting the feed at their faces using various slingshots and what-have-you. Basically, what we have here, is a kid-friendly Wolfenstein 3D.  Now, you've probably mostly all seen the Angry Video Game Nerd's review of the original Super Nintendo game. The one that came in a jank bootleg cartridge that required you to plug another game into the top of it because Nintendo never gave the game their approval.

Things are quiet aboard the Ark... too quiet... when treachery strikes! The Goat from below the darkest depths compels his minions, who have covertly possessed various animals onboard, to ingnite a rebellion. The demonic animals are loose, and out for blood. It's up to you to put. them. down... to sleep! For only then may the taint be ripped from their souls! Armed with with various... um... arms, and a whole lot of the body of Christ, your high seas crusade begins!  With the best graphics and mechanics this side of 1992, I highly recommend this gritty reimagining of one of the most important moments in biblical history.  For the ultimate experience mute the game's soundtrack and play some metal instead.",

Do you value narrative, kinaesthetic resonance, and the disassembly of the current gamer culture over all else in your interactive media? With Super 3-D Noah's Ark, you'll find a wealth of artistic treaure. Originally released as 'Noah no Daibouken: Kokoro Shimapan' for the Japan-only FM Towns Marty, S3DNA is revolutionary for it's time in it's portrayal (and subsequent deconstruction) of the Catholic faith. Over 5 hand-crafted worlds, you'll experience the highs and lows of this classic character's plight to save not only mankind, but art as well. My one complaint would have to be the exclusion of VR support - a world this lovingly sculpted deserves to be experienced to the fullest my human senses will allow.",

The goal of the game is to bed each of them, you do this through a combination of charm, gifts, and various drugs that make them have less judgement. There's Cuntosan the sleazy one, Whoroso the sleazebag, and Mittens, the one who is not a neko/human, but actually just a cat in disguise. Should you manage to accomplish your mission, the game ends with one great orgy on a boat consisting of two of every animal... wait... what game was this again?",
