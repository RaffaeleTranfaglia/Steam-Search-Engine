Eons ago, these were the boulevards and squares of a great necropolis built to house the bones of the races who had fallen to the Necrons, and ultimately were where the Necrons themselves retire to...",

My wife left me 3 weeks ago because I became engulfed by the need to purge the enemies of the imperium. This game destroyed my life, and I would do it again if I could. This game is like heroin. The more you take, the more you need to survive. I have lost 7 pounds in a week because of this game, much like heroin. The difference between heroin and this game is that you only buy this game once and it's legal. Don't do drugs. Drugs are bad. Like heroin or a pineapple pizza.",

(I am also a die-hard 40k fan, so I am also a little bias in the review, you have been warned)  This game however far out-classes all before it (and to an extent after it).  The addition of two new playable factions, those being the Tau (Space commies with Mech suits and angry rooster people) and my personal favorite faction in all of 40k, The Necrons (Spooky scary skeleton robots), of course all the previous factions return with a new unit or two (Imperial guard get weapon teams, Chaos now lets you turn your lord into a daemon prince, etc)  This game also adds a new between-battle map screen where you can upgrade your commader, train an honor guard, reniforce captured provinces and, of course, attack your enemy. Most of the battles are just basic multiplayer style skirmishs against the computer (with the exception of some missions that give you a space port or a daemons fury) but, in the heart of the enemy lines, there is a more mission based level, much like the previous games, that if you can conquer, that faction will be removed from the game, an you'll most likly get a wargear out of it too.  Out of all the 40k games I have played, this is probably the best and most lore faithful (with the exception of the necron/human mix the Parias, they're gone now), sure it plays nothing like the table-top game, but lets be honest here. If it did play like 40k table top, the game would be alot slower and several hundred dollars more costly (But no less awsome)  8.5/10",

Everything is balanced out very well in comparison to the original and the first expansion Winter Assault.   The game offers you and you the possibility to have a more diverse army and not rely solely on the top tier units such as Terminators, Possesed Squad or Warp Spiders.   The Campaign is also fantastic and has an allure of a classic 40K tabletop game.  ",

The campaign is structured in a more non-linear way, allowing you to choose what areas you attack, whether you want to defend an area yourself or let the computer figure out what happens. It's like they spliced in elements of Risk, while maintaining the base building and combat mechanics you've come to expect from Dawn of War.   One thing to note is that you should save often, because if you screw up a mission you'll lose your turn. Also, when attacking an area build the best base and defenses you can because if that area comes under attack by an enemy you automatically start off with all your structures.   This would have been nice to know at the start, as I've pretty much screwed myself over and have to wait a few turns to build resources. Prepare for a little less forgiving experience, and a little more strategy in your attacks. Anyway, it's still Dawn of War and that means it's good.",

It was ok, I guess, but at first, I had trouble keeping enemies at bay and keeping my strategic points. Heck, I didn't even know I could add squad members until about 2 months ago.   I hold a victory celebration after every major victory. A major victory is taking out a faction completely, though a minor victory is taking a certain region.   I suggest you get this. 10/10.

As you conquer more maps, you upgrade the armor and weapons of your main commander making him that much more powerfull and dangerous. You also gain all kind of bonuses to beat the remaining oponents more easily.  There are a lot of factions to choose (8+) and each one play very differently (except the space marine and chaos marines, which are very similar because the chaos marines are space marines converted to the chaos side). The necron for example have very slow ground units so you must build them in big waves and then you send them slowly grinding your ennemies! They are quite resilient but you ain't going to zerg the ennemy with them. And once you get your citadel flying, then boom! nuclear attack all the time on the ennemy! hehehe  The ai is pretty rough even at normal difficulty. Prepare to be zerged fast in the maps you choose! Also, i noticed that the number on the map which is supposed to give you an overall difficulty factor for taking that territory is pointless. I've taken big number territory with ease and been destroyed in an instant on territory with a one difficulty rating! So i would not give too much importance to that number. From what i've seen of the factions, the chaos and space marine seem to be the toughest to beat. They are fast even with their infantry, they got troops that can fly and bypass all your defense while striking in your backline and they are tought. A bit unfair for the other factions tought.",

The campaign takes place on this portion to the game.All the races from DoW 1 + winter assault are included + 2 more. Each race has a strong hold on the map and in order to eliminate that race from the meta map you have to take their strong hold.Story is pretty decent and the gameplay is more polished than in Winter Assault.

Dawn of War Dark Crusade is an expansion to Relic's real time strategy game Dawn of War, which is set in the Warhammer 40, 000 universe of table top wargames. I highly recommend it to any real time stategy fan who loves the grittines and toughness of battles which are primarily set in a distopian future where every alien you meet wants to kill you and eat you for jujubes :D, and that's not all; Your government, which is the Grand Imperium of Man, constantly drafts new recruits in the billions in order to sacrifice to The Emeperor, who uses His powerful psychic mind in order to stave the forces of Super Hell (or Chaos for short) which constantly gobbles up any known dangerous substances in order to get high for the dark gods. The 7 major races are The Blood Ravens; The Emperor's own space marines who came to the planet Kronus to search for the secrets of their lost history. The Ork's or should I say 'Da Orks', only come for the tendency of following their Ork Chieftains for the sake of the Waaaagh!!!! in order to satuate their cravings for constant battle. The Eldar, a mysterious alien race which are a splinters of their former empire 10, 000 years prior to the 41st millenium, have come to Kronus in order to stop their ancient enemies, known as the Necrons, from rising from their tomb worlds and purging the galaxy clean of all sentient life. The Necrons were metallic warriors who slumbered eons ago iduring the aftermath, which in Eldar legend was in the aftermath of the so called 'War in Heaven'. Then there are the imperial guard, chaos and the tau (my favourite), and for that YOU can explore for yourself. For the 4 races I've mentioned there is a ton of lore to explore and unfortunately I cannot tell you all of it. If you think Halo, Startrek and Starwars had tons of lore, you have never read the Lore of 40k, it is just a massive game world that you need to delve into. As for this game I give a solid 9/10.

If you enjoy games like Company of Heroes and Starcraft then this is a can't miss title.  The game is set on the planet Kronus where the Imperial Guard rule in the name of the Emperor but all is not well on Kronus. The Ork invasion has begun anew on this planet and with all the fighting above the ancient killing machines known as the Necron have awaken which in turn has caused the Tau to appear on the planet in an effort to stop them from annihilating all life on the planet. Of course all this extra violence has attracted the attention of the Blood God of Chaos attention and brought the Chaos Marines onto Kronus. And with the Chaos Marines the Eldar quickly came in tow to stop them from ressurecting more demons and overtaking more planets. The Space Marines (namely the Blood Ravens) are ordered to cleanse the planet now for it is considered overrun with the Alien, the Unclean, and the Heretic. Upon their arrival on the planet they are told their are precious artifacts on Kronus that must be reclaimed at all costs and thus order the Imperial Guard to evacuate from Kronus in order for them to purge Kronus and reclaim the artifacts. The Guard promptly refuses and sparks an intense war with the Blood Ravens. This all quickly turns into a nasty open war. How this war plays out however is solely up to you however. The game gives you a decent background for each race and the events leading to the war but it has not true canon story beyond that. Your campaign mode consists of picking 1 of several races (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Marines, Tau, or Necrons) and then using them to conquer the entire map. The campaign starts off on the world screen where you can reinforce your territories launch attacks or upgrade your Honor Guard, which are essentially free beefed up versions of your basic units, as well as upgrade your commander unit with Wargear, items that add health attack or other bonus abilities to your commander unit. Each race has its own Stronghold which if taken will kick them from the game for that campaign. Capture all strongholds to win. All in all the game looks great despite some age, it sounds great and has a decent soundtrack and its positively steeped in lore for every race. Theres dozens of novels written on this series. I highly recommend this game to any and all fans of RTS games. Gotta cut this one short since Steam wont let me write any more about this game! For the Emperor!",

The new campaign is really amazing and more strategic than before. It can take many hours and yet you want to play more.  So in a very quick summary of the races: - Space Marines: Mostly the basic one to understand the game mechanics. Really nice. - Chaos Space Marines: Almost the same as the one before. - Imperial Guard: A little bit more weak but depends more of their numbers. Many of them can be a pain. - Orks: A basic one yet a really powerful army based on numbers. - Eldar: I hate them. Always based on stealth most of the time. - Tau Empire: These guys are a bit interesting, it's like a mix of Space Marines with Eldar, pretty fun units. - Necrons: Pretty heavy and a bit hard to learn but they can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ if you are against someone.
