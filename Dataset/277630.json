            "review_text": "Good game,but too simply in comparison with Panzer corps or the old Dos based Panzer General series. The different types of the units arent useful because the only different because of them is that the modern ones better in all way (except price)the older one. So u will always use the moderner types of the units. The missions have also not really challenge cos there are only a few missions in all campaign and the missions are linear,there is not difference if u win or lose (if lose game is over)-except 1-2 bonus mission-but in comparison with Panzer General series (from the 1990's) there is much fewer missions and units. It would be better to create a game with only one side of the fighting forces (allies/axis/russia/japs) but with more interesting and bigger numbered campaigns and more different units. I also didn't like the game cartoon-style graphics and I missed some WWII picture /movie in game to increase its entertaining value for a WWII fan. In all,the game is not bad,the main feature of it is the generals,but after you ended a campaign you wont want start the next,cos it became soon boring.",

If you ever played panzer General 2 then you will certainly enjoy this game.. It lacks a few things yes, for one , the AI could be stronger, otherwise I enjoy this game and am sure you will too.",
