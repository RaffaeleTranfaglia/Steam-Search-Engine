            "review_text": "Played about 30+ mins before bed, the game drops you right in to a fight,with no real instruction, i read the controls from the pause menu option though and found it much easier with my controller. Fighting seems good, though the mancer is a tad too slow in my opinion. Had fun playing, love the mechanics and the aesthetic, beautiful art design, definitely plan on playing more later!! Worth the price and more",
