            "review_text": "Big Action Mega Fight! is a classic beat 'em up game with cartoon style, what first been released for a mobile devices, but now comes to PC also.  The story of the game you´ll probably seeing in other similar games, the bad guys kidnapped your friend, you try to help escape...   The gameplay is simple enough, here you will find a leves what you should complete, you will find here two level types, ones is time based and the other, is to beat all enemies. Also you will find here a 5 different enemies, for each one you should use a bit different tactic and combat, your charter also can use a some special skills. While you are completing a leves, you can pick up a coins, what you can spend later to upgrade your health, damage, boost drop, special skill . Beating the levels shouldn´t take to much time from you, avarege you can complete each one in a 3 minute and because this a game enough short, but can be addicting.  The game graphic is cartoon styled and looks nice. The sound are nice and a music well bring a 90s atmosphere.  So my verdict:  +nice music +steam cards and achievements +addicting gameplay +good controls  -short -no coop -only two game modes  So i think this game really can bring for you a couple hours fun if you play it, however you can complete a game enough fast. The biggest minus of the game that: you will not find here coop or leaderboard feature, it really can be a good addition for a game. Anyway i think if you like this kind of games you should try this out, especially if its get a bigger discount .",

            "review_text": "One of the better 'Beat'em up' games I've played. Crisp cartoon'y graphics with well-designed characters. The reward/upgrade/challenge ramp feels about right, with many different items to upgrade. The stages change quickly enough to stay fresh and the little bit of story doesn't drag on, but rather adds short humorous banter between stages for a few seconds.  On the down-side, I'm missing two things I enjoy about this genre:   Bosses: While some harder enemies are introduced every couple stages, and usually first show up as the last enemy of a stage, they don't feel very epic or boss'y. I've probably only progressed through half the story progression, but in that time, there were no comic-style intros or large health bars, arising out of the explosion that brought a huge boss onto the battlefield. None of that stuff, but maybe the games saves boss stuff for the end?  Interactive Environments: Sure, there's the generic stuff: trash cans, barricades, mall kiosks, cars... but they're all a single frame images, outlined with a black line, as if to say 'destroy me for a couple coins'. If items could be damaged (3 - 6 frames) or used on the battlefield (i.e. projectiles to hit towards enemies), that would add a lot of fun to this game. There's just not a lot to do, other than 'Beat 'em up', whereas games like Turtles in Time and the SNES Bevis and Butthead game (among dozens of other good examples, I'm sure) had plenty of fun things to play with while you were doing the beating up.  Overall, a fun game which I'll probably put another couple hours into, to complete and three-star all the levels. (which makes me want to add 'too easy?')",

The only thing I don't like is it's singal player and thats kinda a no-no when it comes to beat um ups. Also level system is set up like a tablet game short levels and star based rating system .,.I just personally don't like when games are set up that way .  ",
