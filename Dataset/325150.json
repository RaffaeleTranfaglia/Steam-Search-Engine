            "review_text": "Run or Die is a very addictive game, in a good way. The game's simple enough to drag you in, and more than challenging enough to keep your attention for a long time.   The game art is very well done and if you're not careful you'll be spending more time looking at the scenery than looking at what's in front of you. Thankfully the music is very relaxed and is a joy to listen to while getting sliced into small bits because of LASERS. I HATE THEM SO MUCH!  All in all, it's a great game and it's more than worth its fair price!",

            "review_text": "I'm not necessarily in for Endless runners, or at least usually... However the atmosphere of the game - brought to life with both the graphics and the simple, yet amazing soundtrack - is just overwhelming.  Remember the feeling when you get home from school/work/everyday tiring life event, wanting to do something, but lack any capability to do so?  This game just changed that. Even if you fail spectacularly in-game(Like I did more than I could count), the music combined with the aesthetics will keep you running!  All in all: It is WELL worth the price, and whoever you may be, if you buy this you'll be in for a treat :)  ",

            "review_text": "If you like platformers then this is definitely worth the 5$ and the reasons being that the art style is phenomenal, the music is amazing and does not get repetitive or annoying, the characters have emotions, the idea for the characters and powers all comes together very nicely. Also you can see that the developers had some fun creating the game (the secret achievement) I bought the game and only played 2 hours of it so far (planning to play some more) but i would say you would get at least 5 hours if you complete easy and normal challenges on 1 star, do a little bit of training, play the intro, play some endless mode. If you do end up getting the game press backspace on the keyboard when you die so that you respawn quicker because that seems to annoy some people a LOT and you can save 2-3 seconds this way. Also in my opinion it is nice that they took the anime genre in a different direction from dating sim visual novel, 2d fighter, jrpgs or bullet hell to something new.  All in all it's a very good game that did not recieve as much credit as it should have. Also note i said at LEAST 5 hours. Completing a lot of the game, achievements, community levels, time spent on endless mode vary from person to person which means if you want to complete the game (or get close to) you can get well over 15 hours.",

The only negative I can really think of is that the game comes with a fairly high frustration factor, but that's to be expected given the genre.",
