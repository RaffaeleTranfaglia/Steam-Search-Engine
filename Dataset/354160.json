            "review_text": "First of all, if you are looking for a rally sim, this game is not for you. I really wonder why Kylotonn Racing Games says that this game is a simulator, because it's not. Not even close, to be honest. And it's not a bad thing. Not for me, at least. Of course that it's a very negative aspect of the game, given the fact that the fans were waiting for an officially-licensed WRC simulator for ages. Unfortunately, they will need to wait a bit more. Even if it's not realistic, playing it is quite enjoyable: it makes you feel like a professional rally driver, nailing all the corners and flying through the straights. It's one of the most rewarding feelings while playing a rally game, of course. And you do not even need to practice a lot to be able to reach that level of 'skill', which makes it suitable for rally lovers without too much spare time. And, even if pretty easy, nailing the stages is rewarding. Just like it would be at a simulator, but effortlessly.   'Why are all the reviews negative, then?'. That's something worth questioning. And it's clearly noticeable after 30 minutes into it: it's a massive step back from WRC 4, graphically, content-wise and physically. And it wasn't even a great rally game back in the days, because Milestone (old developer) wasn't able to leave the comfort zone and make something different. From WRC '1' (2010) to WRC 4 (2013), nothing changed at all, with a few exceptions (career mode was slightly improved after WRC 3, bringing classic cars and new categories). Anyway, small changes end up equalling to nothing. Mostly when pretty much everything looks the same. This is exactly why Kylotonn ended up holding the license, with a simple mission: develop the best WRC game ever made. I don't even need to mention that they failed miserably.  WRC 5 is not bad. It's far away from it. The negative results are simply the reflex of disappointing the WRC fans. They were expecting a simulator, with great graphics, close to real-life stages, realistic engine sounds, convincing physics and top-notch content overall. What they got, though, was 'more of the same': the only thing that they could consider as new were the updated cars, drivers and stages. Everything else, from gameplay to career mode, was the same. Nothing innovative, nothing exceptional. Just the usual. How could they expect their fans to react nicely?  The cars are considerably beautiful (given the limitations), and so are the stages. It's really fun to drive fast through every country, nailing every single piece of it and feeling like the ultimate king of WRC. It's more than fun, honestly. It's amazing. That's where WRC 5 shines. The career mode is great, extremely immersive and rewarding but kinda empty at the same time. Maybe because it's exactly like every single career mode that the franchise had before. Innovations could and would be great. Why not to make something different like character customization, press conferences, etc...? Is it that hard to do? I don't think so. Kylotonn had to dig deeper and bring something jaw-dropping, but they decided to not take any risks and brought something that the players were used to. It's an arrow in the knee, considering that career mode is usually what most of the players are looking for (and multiplayer, of course).  If you are a huge fan of the onboard cam, this game is going to disappoint you a little bit. It felt just like being shot from behind when I took the Lancer Evolution X to a ride through Mexico and noticed something quite unusual about the interior: believe it or not, it was the Impreza's. Yes, a Mitsubishi with a Subaru interior. This evidences how much research were done in order to bring the best WRC experience that you could ever ask for.  There are lots of positive aspects, though. The cars have different liveries for each and every rally, with the respective logo (ADAC, RACC, Neste Oil Finland, etc). It's a small detail that makes a lot of difference. DiRT Rally, on the other hand, has the same sticker for each and every stage. Would be even better if it was actually an innovation, but the old Milestone titles had it as well. Same for the custom name on the window (which is incredibly immersive and extremely cool, and I am glad that Kylotonn 'copied' this). Two little details that end up counting a lot.  Regarding wheel support, this game is a joke. The actual list of supported wheels has less than 7 different models if I am not wrong. It's unacceptable for a 2015 game, and the devs promised a fix one year ago. Nothing yet. Continuous support is really important if you actually want your game to be popular and loved by the players.   If you are just a casual looking for fun, dust and high speeds, this game is definitely worth a try. Do not pay full-price for it, though. Kylotonn is asking way too much for what the game actually offers. Wait for a sale and then buy it, download it and play it. If you are a rally lover like me, you are going to enjoy this game a lot (as long as you do not expect it to be a simulator, and also ignore the negative aspects).",

            "review_text": "I like it.  The stage design is good, the handling is decent, the graphics are average and the audio is mediocre.  The handling is quite forgiving and easy to get the hang of, but there's room to better yourself through practice.  There are 65 different stages ranging from 2 to 12 km spread across 13 locations.  The stage design itself is quite good, but the road surfaces themselves could use more bumps and camber changes.  The visuals aren't too impressive, but there are a lot of nice visual details around and being able to choose time of day and weather for any track is great. The car models and damage look pretty good too.  The audio isn't too impressive either and while the co-driver is functional, they sound pretty robotic.  They have handled the service-park repairs well, with partial repairs being an option and some components being completely replaced.  Overall I thoroughly enjoy the game and would recommend it if you're a fan of the WRC and Rally games.  I think WRC 5 is a commendable effort by Kylotonn and I look forward to the sequel should they make one, this game is a solid foundation for the next.",

I try to configure my video settings and I have a high performance video card (Nvidia) with 4 Gb dedicated and well dont like at all this. In the scale from 0-10 I give a 7 I was expecting a better gameplay and graphics but in my opinion it does not have it .....but for the price is ok. I probably buy other game related to RALLY as is Dirty Rally.  But please dont take it in a bad way is just I like it but not in the way that it supposed to be.  OK Enjoy it.  Well here is my update .....I finished the career mode at junior WRC and after that, the game itself turns pretty cool for me.....so, I like it for sure. I think that the best improvements could be the animation and steering control, or what do you think?",

But if you want a funny and easy-to-learn simcade (mixture between pure arcade like in Need for Speed and simulation like in Dirt Rally or Richard Burns Rally) title, you will have fun with it :)  Graphics and sound are only mediocre, but drifting around is a lot of fun, even with a keyboard. Unlike Dirt Rally, this game forgives errors and one small mistake doesn't mean you have to restart the stage. The variety of tracks and cars is great, unfortunately there are no classic rally cars (e.g. group B). The weather effects can create an amazing athmosphere, driving through sweden at night while it snows is something very different compared to the same stage at daylight with sunshine.  Some players have reported performance problems. For me, they are gone since update 1.09 and the new 'Option A' for Vsync.",
