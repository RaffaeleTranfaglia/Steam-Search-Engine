            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game. It's silly, it has a Tommy Wiseau pigeon, and it costs $1. But some things are just broken.  The entire game consists of flying left or right and pressing space to poop on things. Sometimes the things move, and sometimes there is wind, so your poop moves. The dialogue between levels is in broken English that is usually understandable if you take an extra second or two. All of that is fine. It's funny, simple, and endearing.  The problem is the one difficulty mechanic (admittedly I didn't get very far) is wind. Wind makes your poop move, and wind changes direction, except it doesn't. Currently there's a wind indicator that shows you whether wind is blowing left or right. Wind always blows right, even if the indicator says it's blowing left.  Also apparently it's just a browser game, because every time I hit F12 to take a screenshot (the default keybind in Steam) a Chrome debugger window pops up over the game.  On one hand it's $1 and it's entertaining enough that I kind of don't care. On the other hand I just paid $1 for a browser game with one mechanic that doesn't even work.",

Pretty fun and challenging game where the levels require you to be precise with your ♥♥♥♥ accuracy as well as little room for error (I mean it!). One problem is the fact that the language options are limited to either English or Russian. Lemme tell ya, the english ain't that good, but it still perfectly portrays the way Tommy Wiseau would speak so all is well.   I'd give it a 6.5/10 (noting the fact that it's cost is 1$, I didn't expect much)",
