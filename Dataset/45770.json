            "review_text": "Dead Rising 2: Off The Record is a hard game to judge. Dead Rising 2 was a good game, the problem with Dead Rising 2 is that it's the same game. By that I don't mean 'Oh they reused the assets' or 'They used the same map'. Both of those are acceptable. No Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, literally did a character swap and changed less than a third of the story.   To be honest, this should not have been it's own game. This is almost DLC masquerading as a full release. There is some other changes (a few more survivors, a few changes to survivors, I think a few new psychopaths) but if you've played Dead Rising 2 right before this game, this is going to be like a second playthrough of Dead Rising.   As for the story, there's really two major changes that I noticed. Instead of Chuck being blamed for releasing zombies, another person is blamed. (A character that appears in the original game). And the ending. The final boss, (literally the final scene) is different, with a significantly change to the ending.   There is one new (and rather large) area that is added to the game, that is a nice addition, but it's just that, an addition, not a whole new world.   Other than that, the game, majority of psychopathes and majority of the mall is the same. You're seeing similar people doing similar things, and fighting similar enemies.   So there's really three ways to look at it.   If you played Dead Rising 1 and want to play Dead Rising 2, I would recommend Off The Record, over Dead Rising 2.  If you played Dead Rising 2, you likely will not want to play Off The Record.  If you played Dead Rising 2 but the whole time thought 'I want to play as Frank West' Then Dead Rising 2 Off the Record is for you.   It's not a BAD game, it's fully functional, vastly improves on Dead Rising 2 (You don't have to stand still to talk to Otis, who is not in this version, you get a really functional ear piece as well). The achievements are better as well, the game works well, and you don't have to constantly return to the hideout to give Zombrex to Katie (what an awful gameplay element that was).   If you don't have Dead Rising 2, this is the better version. If you do... I find it hard to recommend this version as you already have a working game. It's not a bad, and I can't not recommend Dead Rising 2: Off the Record because it does nothing wrong. But it is quite a bit of a cash grab for Capcom, and honestly they could have told an all new story. A shame, because this is a rather fun series.   Still I had a blast replaying Dead Rising 2 as I played it when it first came out, and for that. Off the Record delivered exactly what it promised. A retelling of Dead Rising 2 with a new main character.",

The story mode is the exact same from the original Dead Rising 2, just with some minor differences, like the intro, rather than having Frank competing in TIR in the slicycle challenge, you're competing in a wrestling minigame which teaches you the basics of the game and other dialouge in cutscenes.   A great change though is the co-op mode.  In the original Dead Rising 2, if you had someone join, there would be 2 Chuck Greene's.  In DR2 Off the Record, player one is Frank West, player 2 is Chuck Greene and like in Case West, they don't get on well on at all.  Example. Frank tries on a new outfit 'I look hot' and if Chuck is nearby 'You look stupid'.    I'd highly recommend it with a friend.   ",

            "review_text": "He's covered wars y'know? Frank West is back, and he is fatter and more out of shape than ever! This game takes the prestine gameplay of Dead Rising 2, and spices it up with a bit of Frank West. In this game, you play in an alternate 'what if' version of Dead Rising 2, where you play as everyones favorite fighting (ex-)photojournalist Frank West. It depicts Frank after the Willimette mall incident, having become overweight and bankrupt, due to the overexposure to the limelight. He is participating in the Terror Is Reality zombie killing game show, in order to net some cash, and get himself back on the map. Unfortunately, there seems to be trouble brewing in the bowels of Fortune City, as Frank finds himself in the middle of another Zombie outbreak. It is up to you, as Frank, to find the truth, and save as many survivors as you can. The gameplay is identical to that of Dead Rising 2, with a few improvements to animation, as well as more missions, bosses, and ways to kill. There is nothing but praise I can give to this game, try it out for yourself, you won't regret it. Dead Rising 2: Off The Record gets an 8.5/10. This game lost a point due to a few side missions that glitched for me, making them unplayable.",

Gameplay is more fun because of the bigger variety in weapons, the combat feels less clunky overall, the game has a better setting making it more fun to explore the area and there is more variety to the environments visually and there is a much higher level of interaction with the world with just more items to interact with in general. The survivors ai is by far the biggest improvement, it’s actually good. They follow you pretty well and their pathfinding is pretty good too. I hated Frank West in the original but In this game he is far less annoying and cringe worthy making him at least bearable. The dialogue, voiceacting and plot is also now bearable which it wasn’t in the original for me. It’s not a good story by any means but it is far better than the original. I think this is a good and very fun zombie game. It’s one of those sequels that does exactly what sequels should do which is improve on every aspect of the original.  7/10 (Good)",

The transition didn't do much aside from add achievements and break multiplayer (me and many others haven't gotten it to work at all since the update). The save transfer tool (which took Capcom months to actually release) doesn't work either.    Basically it's an alright game to get if you dont have Dead Rising 2 already. The added sandbox mode with no time limit is a great option to have if you just wanna mess around killing stuff and leveling up. Not really too much to say to be honest, but it's quite fun.",

When Dead Rising 2 came out, a part of me was sad that Frank wasn't in it, but Chuck Greene was a great protaganist also. When I heard that they made a Dead Rising 2 with Frank West as the protagnist, I thought Capcom was high on something tropical.   The game itself is Dead Rising 2 with small changes and fixes and all new kinky Alien amusement park. Frank is now your protagnist, with Chuck being your co-op partner and having a part in a side-mission as well. Certian Characters have changed roles but in all much hasn't changed. You can still tell its Dead Rising 2 but enough has changed to keep you going.  The game is great if you wanted more slapping zombies with adult toys and wanting to take pictures of you throwing said adult toys at a midget clown on stilts.  The game is great if you don't care for Dead Rising 3 all that much but don't want to keep playing Dead Rising 2.",

No hiccups despite tons of zombies, and environments looked fine.. Netplay handled lag quite well. Controls are slightly weird and can't be rebound but the defaults were not troublesome enough to make me gripe.  The game does a good job of giving you pacing with optional quests to save survivors. You dont have a moment to easily breathe unless you are okay with letting a survivor die or missing a bossfight (but they are only worth EXP, so not completely necessary).

Makes it really fun and relaxing to just explore and kill zombies for an hour here, or an hour there, and watch as your kill count goes higher and higher without having to worry about starting a new game every five minutes like in the other dead rising games.",

(That will say 50 euro)  With only some added weapons, some new features and completely having broken and porely edited some boss fights that obviously tried to kill you because you were before Chuck Greene who was believed to have started the zombie outbreak. Since you aren't Chuck Greene and neither you or him started the outbreak this time you'll get some horribly edited boss fights.   Some pros with the game though is that they've fixed alot of things, such as  -Checkpoints when you leave to a new area -More weapons and items -Free roam mode - Go free in fortune city with no timer, no quests, no need for zombrex and just kill alot of zombies and complete challenges for medal, money and PP earned in Free roam will also be shared with your story character. -Doesn't run on that ♥♥♥♥ing horrible Microsoft Live crap that some games used.  If you have to pick from one of the two Dead Rising 2 games, pick this one.",

Frank West is such a different character that it gives the game the right amount of new and old. I would definitely recommend picking this game up on a sale.",

If you like zombie games this is the game for you. However, there is a game breaking bug in this version that makes it unbeatable. At about 85% through the main story, there is an infinite loading screen that keeps you from continuing. No fixes I have seen work, even though people report online that it does fix the issue. I highly recommend this game as it is probably my favorite co-op game out there, however do not get it on steam.",

There is a sort of story more, but most of the game you are forced to rush past stuff you'd rather stop to look at otherwise the quest timers run out. You can let the quest timers run out if you want to, except for the main case quests. Managed to complete the first 4 case quests and then gave up since it just was not fun to rush around any more.  I got to level 5 (pretty much nothing), and my coop partner reached a staggering level 4 since her character was not saved when we reached checkpoints, and the game crashed when she got to level 4 and forced us to reconnect.  All in all, it's probably a decent game if you like the time limited quests mentioned above, but I just can't recommend the game because of this.",

I played as the guest (I didn't host the session), I experienced some issues after cutscenes when the host was able to save the game, my game crashed and had to perform a restart of the games. I therefore lost all my character progression, which was very annoying.   I also didn't like the timer we've got on all our missions. I really like to walk around exploring the stores and ambient, but this caused us til eventually save the game, and not having time to finish the mission. We basically ended in an evil loop.   The mechanics feels like, as way too many games today are, that it's portet from console.   I didn't finish the game and don't feel like the story was good enough to make me want to try the game again.",
