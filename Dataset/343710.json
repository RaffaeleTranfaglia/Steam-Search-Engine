You have to use map and a compass and to me it was something new and after hours of playing I still like it.  - It's boring. I haven't played this game in a week and not like I missed it much. I just remember that to collect the rest of the papers I'll have to spend hours just wandering in the woods and then replaying bc I get caught up by an enemy again and again and again.. - Too difficult (сложна :'0 ). There's not way to contrattack enemies, they move quite fast and in dark/unknown areas you easily get lost and caught. Game saves in camps or on the last note point and sometimes you gotta make long way to the place where you stopped before. - Monsters. Design is okay but after SO many encounters they don't scare at all.  - Navigation.. Yeah, it's good but I wish there was some kind of hint to help when you're completely lost. Doesn't has to be a huge neon arrow but some noticeable objects could help.  - No explanation on what to do. In game you have quite useless info and you gotta figure out yourself the heck is going on.  Kholat is like a candy that looks really nice but tastes like a potato. I made many pretty screenshots and loved the work on the visual part but this game gives me no desire to finish it which I think speaks for itself.",

            "review_text": "This game is beautiful and haunting. Between the music, the scenery, feeling truly lost, and constantly feeling watched wherever you go, this game is immersive and atmospheric in the absolute best way. This game is horror done right. While there was only one time that nearly gave me a heart attack, every moment of gameplay was tense and uneasy.  Throughout the first hour or so, I honestly had no idea how to navigate. I had no idea where to start or what to look for. But slowly, the game allowed me to learn naturally instead of forcing a tutorial down my throat. Needless to say, by the end of my time on Kholat Syakhl I was an expert navigator. The sense of accomplishment from that alone was extremely satisfying.  In terms of graphical fidelity, this game is very impressive. The textures especially were simply gorgeous. They all look like you could reach out and just feel the bumpiness of the rocks or the grit of the dirt. The mountains give you beautiful snowy forest vistas, while the caves are cold and damp, literally dripping with ambiance.  The soundtrack is quite good, although it's not necessarily one I'd listen to outside of actual gameplay. A couple tracks are sweeping and nice to listen to, but by and large the soundtrack is full of gripping drums and blaring low horns. It does a great job of keeping you always looking over your shoulder. There are some vocal tracks, and they are used appropriately. One at the beginning, one towards the end that fits well with a note you find just before you get a story beat, and one in the credits that, in my opinion, was maybe the weakest of the vocal tracks.  Pros: Beautiful graphics Simple controls that do only what you need Rewarding navigation difficulty curve (maybe a negative for you - YMMV) Interesting story that ends in such a way to keep you guessing and speculating Pretty good soundtrack Top notch voice acting A lot of content and scenery to discover  Cons: I might've liked a few more graphical options Stamina mechanic (though this is just a personal dislike in games, and a minor gripe at worst) If you're a seasoned horror vet as I am, you won't be scared out of your mind constantly. Look elsewhere if you want that No manual saving  All in all, this game is an 8/10 from me. Or a must buy. Whatever scoring appeals to you, it's worth a buy, even at full price. This is by far one of the best horror games to hit steam in recent memory, and from an indie studio no less. Thank you, IMGN.PRO, for such an engrossing experience!",

The amount of time I spent just wandering is unimaginable.   The enemies aren't really enemies, since they never seem to do anything but walk really slowly and look spooky. I didn't even realise they were actually bad guys until the middle of the game when I walked directly into one because I wanted a closer look. Avoiding them after that was effortless. Not very scary.  The story is kind of interesting when you read all the pages and stuff, but it's hard to kind of fit it in with why you're just wandering around on a mountain and who left all these pages all over the place.  100% achievements isn't too hard, just try not to die and finish the game, it's a lot of walking. You can return to the menu in the middle of your dying animation so it's not too difficult.",

            "review_text": "My Overall rating for KHOLAT: 80/100  Kholat is a survival atmospheric horror game, where you should do two things. Both finding the clues and enjoying the atmosphere of rough Russian mountain country. Produced by Polish developers, game was supposed to rely more on visuals and this should intense the story, mysterious and creepy in its very nature. Lets see in details on the aspects of the game.  GAMEPLAY  + Open world + Impressive atmosphere + Useful devices - a map and a flashlight + Accesible notes + Main anomalies + Nice story about speculative incident o Map orientation - Inability to jump  Gameplay is decent, and it reminded me another game designed in this way (The Vanishing of Ethan Carter). What I evaluate as the most positive, is open world and atmosphere. You are able to explore the world as you wish and the night at Russian mountain accompanied by perfect soundtrack. Yes, you have to seek for notes and clues behind the Dyatlov Pass Incident, but you can give yourself a beautiful time just walking around and enjoying the sceneries.  Also, the story is perfectly designed, it does not show the only right possibilities, but it lets you have your own theory by giving another point of view, which you can live through the notes and environment.  It is a great idea to use only map and compass for orientation, furthermore, you have to rely on your memory, because there is no 'GPS' to show, what your current position is. But, there is one confusion, though the North is on the lower side of the map, when you are going north, you are approaching the upper side. After realising this, the orientation is a piece of cake. And there needs to be mentioned, that compass and flashlight are going nuts, when anomalies approach, so you know you have to walk away swiftly.  The most negative was the inability to jump. Seriously, one rock and your progress is delayed, until you find a route around, what may disguise players from playing this game.  CHARACTERS  + Beautiful voice acting + Sean Bean narration + Believable settings + Mixing with other event even beyond Soviet Union o Mystery behind our hero  I like Sean Bean's reading of some notes and telling the crucial points. Even the voice of the female student is perfect, you can see, as the events went from paradise to complete horror. Settings were believable, everything is messed with another events, which are transcending even the existence of Soviet Union.  What confused me is our role, but the end was really creepy and shocking, I recommend to collect all notes to reveal it, you will be shocked. I did not know until the last moment, what might discourage people from playing the game.  VISUALS  + Perfect sceneries - Tree glitches and resolution  Sceneries are awesome, it can be called 'Scenery Porn', they are really enjoyable, each screenshot can serve as wallpaper. But the resolution is not very well adapted for 1920x1080 screen, it is well compensated while playing, but after recording, you can see, that it is a bit lower, and I can not help myself, that nowadays, 1080p is a standard in gaming industry. I have encountered few glitches, when snow was 'dancing' on the trees. Just details.  SOUNDTRACK  + Well set according to the situation + Beautiful vocals  Soundtrack has no mistake, if you like the game music, it has a reasonable prize, for buying. It enhances the atmosphere and serves as a well designed addition to the game. Brilliant.  CONCLUSION  Kholat is a specific genre of game, very often named also as 'walking simulator'. I have to admit, that not everyone should like the game, but if you seek something, that will give you a decent story, stunning environment and some amount of creepiness, you will be pleasured. I also think, that even players outside this genre might be pleased.  So in the end, even despite some scars on the game, as inability to jump or confusing orientation in the beginning, I can recommend the game and soundtrack as well.   Go to the Russian wilderness and seek out the truth! Strongly recommended.",

Well yeah, if you're not willing to look for any ♥♥♥♥ing clues whatsoever.  This is a game where you create your own way to play. This is literally the same as how you would act if this really happened to you. So this game is realistic as hell!. And that cinematic tho.  No, i haven't played a lot, yet. This game is better than the thumbs and reviews say. The ones that are giving thumbs down, are the ones that don't have a clue at all about what to do. And some don't even try.

Let me just say this: the mixed review rating is definitely deserved.  The majority of the game is wandering around with your compass or map out and avoiding a monster that teleports every time you turn around. As a result, if you keep running while he’s behind you, he’ll stay behind you. Once you figure this out a lot of the horror aspect is lost and it basically becomes a walking simulator where you try to get from one point of interest to the other. The story and atmosphere are…okay until you realize that you’ll be wandering around for 10-15 minutes in between anything interesting happening.  I was fortunate enough to only spend about $6 on this title, and there is no way I could justify that (let alone the base price of $20!) Just watch a longplay on youtube with the lights turned out instead, you’ll get the same experience.  ",

Then fell through broken ground , ending up with a white screen while battling a blizzard - going straight was getting me nowhere so looking down on the ground showed how little progress I had made, as my footprints were going in cute little circles and not in a straight line at all. Then I saw it - a camp, as I ventured forth I entered the tent and got 2 items that are as useful as 2 chocolate tea pots, A compass that is useless as north seems to be south and visa versa . A Map that does not indicate where I am , and only shows items found , certain areas in world will have coordinates to where items are - not much use since the compass is messed up. There is no auto save in this game and it really needs one, there is a checkpoint system that saves the game once you find an item. After finding 3 items I was quite happy , I proceeded across a lot of the world finding more coordinates and then they appeared - firey footprints - what the heck? I backed off and then sprinted , my character gasping for air after the fourth step - really? Then the firey footprint owner caught up with me and killed me. So I started to play again and was spawned at the place I had found the third item. I decided to take another route and within seconds torch man got me again. I had hoped to have liked this game , my interest in the real story wanting to know what had happened to those poor souls in 1959 was why I bought the game, but if the devs think adding some firey entity as the answer then shame on them.

            "review_text": "Kholat is a horror game developed by IMGN.PRO. The game is based on the true-event known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. In Kholat players take on the role of some person walking through the mountains and collecting notes and avoiding some teleporting/slow-moving entity (very similar to Slender) all while being narrated by the ever-famous, man who always dies, Sean Bean. The notes you are collecting are supposed to reveal the story and events around the Dyatlov Pass Incident but there really doesn’t seem to be much of a story present in Kholat and it feels more like the developers didn’t exactly know what they were doing and decided to just adopt the tired, and stale Slender formula we’ve been seeing in indie-horror titles as of late, which is a huge bummer coming from Kholat.  Basing a game around the events of the Dyatlov Pass Incident should be a solid premise, and make an amazing horror game but that doesn’t exactly happen when you dip into Kholat. Instead you get a pretty boring, and frustrating game that feels like a chore to progress through, and doesn’t offer much in terms of excitement or enjoyment. You’re thrown into an ‘open-world’ environment that looks gorgeous, I won’t deny that. Kholat is one damn good looking game, thanks to Unreal Engine 4 and the amazing environmental work that was done on the game. The mountains look foreboding, and unnerving especially when I came across two giant skulls carved into the face of a cliff. Sadly, that’s about all that Kholat really offers in term of a horror experience. Through-out my time spent with the game I really only found myself feeling creeped out by certain parts of the environment. The enemies weren’t exactly terrifying, and were more so frustrating, or downright annoying to deal with. They work pretty similar to how Slenderman works. A slow-moving, possible teleporting (it seems like they can teleport in front of you which is downright annoying) entity that stalks you the entire time while you collect notes. Seem familiar? That’s the core concept of Kholat in a nut-shell. Explore a creepy environment, collect notes, and avoid the entity that is stalking you. Even the entity seems to be confused during the game as well. I often found myself watching the entity stop chasing me and just stand still, or change direction and start walking away from me. Where’s the fear in that? And you’re most likely to be killed by the environment, which offers no sort of warning when you could die. It’s more like a random, gotcha sort of incident which is horrible. Kholat doesn’t exactly bring anything fresh, or new to the table in terms of an experience, which again is a bummer considering how good Kholat could of been.  The game also allows you to fast-travel at campsites that you discover which is a glorious feature that I’m glad was implemented due to how agonizing, and boring it is to traverse the environment after a while. This mainly stems from doing a ton of backtracking, and walking in circles. Then again, this could be intentional due to the disorienting environment and this could possible be what the victims of the real-life incident felt before their untimely demise. Sadly, it doesn’t work and just makes the game boring and again, feel like more of a chore to play. That and the entire movement system in the game is pretty godawful. You can sprint for what is maybe a few seconds before tiring out and moving at an extremely sluggish pace and it takes a fair bit of time to be able to sprint again. It makes the moments where you need to run-away from the entities, and the “orange fog” that tends to chase you to be frustrating. It feels like this was intended to make players feel tense and scared but all I felt was severe annoyance, which isn’t a good thing. You want players to have fun, and feel terrified. Not annoyed, and angry at poorly designed mechanics.  I’ve only put around 3 hours into Kholat and I can tell I’m nearing the end-game area. The story seems to be expanding, but is still extremely convoluted with no real direction. What am I doing in the mountain? Why did I decide to come here? Who the hell are these entities walking around? The game offers really no explanation for anything, and even Sean Bean seems like he didn’t want to be there, and maybe even he too was confused by the entire ordeal.  In the end, would I recommend Kholat? That depends. At $21.99 (currently on sale for $19.79) I wouldn’t. Maybe if the game were to drop to around $10 I’d be happy telling people to pick it up, but I don’t feel comfortable recommending a bare and a non-enjoyable experience like this for that kind of a price-point. Kholat had a solid premise, and some unique concepts but it sort of failed to deliver. It has amazing visuals, and the setting is great but it really just falls flat on delivery. Pros   Awesome setting, and based off of a spooky real-life event with the Dyatlov Pass Incident.  Gorgeous visuals, and at times can feel really uneasy while traversing through the snow-ridden, blizzard like environments.  Sandbox-ish?  Cons   Not much meat to the game. More of a Slender clone by walking around, gathering notes, and avoiding some slow-walking/teleporting entity.  Sean Bean’s narration feels a tad phoned in.  The story is extremely convoluted, and the game doesn’t really have any sense of direction.  The game is more frustrating then it is fun. The deaths you experience are more so random, and put on a more luck-based feel. Maybe you’ll randomly get killed by the environment with no warning.  Doesn’t exactly feel like a horror game, and more so feels like an adventure narrative sort of experience in the veins of Dear Esther.  Sadly, Kholat just isn’t all that great of a game and for that price-point I’d recommend you check it out if it gets a price drop. I was really excited for Kholat as I’m super into the Dyatlov Pass Incident, but the game didn’t fully utilize what it could of with these events and sort of just falls flat.",

In summary this game basically expects you to devote HOURS trying to understand what it wants.  I wanna reiterate - I do 'get' what they wanted to do with this game - make it a true survival experience where you have to chart out a map and handle a compass and record coordinates and stuff but in practice all of that frustration effectively butchers the immersion.  My 30 minutes - booted up the game, cool intro with Sean Bean narration, and then they put you in some town with no objective/direction/context. I wandered around until I found a path that I went down, the game put some white-wash 'blizzard' screen effect on but it didn't go away properly so after 5 or so minutes of holding 'W' I rebooted it. Now the effect went away, I wandered around some more, saw a little orangey black thing that I figured was a clue so I went to check it out. It stood there, wiggled back and forth, ran away then ran back then walked up to me, threw a limpdick slap in my direction and the game coughed up a 'game over' screen. Waste of a dollar, even if Humble Bundle gave half to charity.",

The story has weight, the pacing is very well done and the environment is beautiful yet terrifying all at the same time. Taking the time to absorb the environment is probably one of the best ways to adjust to the time between the vital points of the game. I found myself just wandering and getting lost because I was so entranced by the scenery... and then I nearly have a heart attack because the anomally pops up in front of me.   Summing up, if you enjoy a game that has pride in its ability to pull you away from the thought of being scared while being a horror game Kholat is a very good choice. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of psychological horror games and I would say a good way to play this game is in longer sessions.  I hope to see more games coming from IMGN.PRO and hope they continue in the same style as Kholat.",

A bunch o' stupid college kids went runnin' ALL over Siberia just throwin' their diary pages all over the damn place, and now YOU gotta pick it up ... slowly. In a blizzard. Oh, and some science-y investigator type did it to.  You can read all that stuff if you want. It tells some kinda story.  Oh, and there are some creepy orange dudes running around. What a mind job.

This game is VERY atmospheric, and I felt it conveyed a sense of tragedy and underlying terror very well.  I made fun of the notes, but the notes and journals were, honestly: THE GAME. The whole story is in there, and piecing it together was fun for me.  So, I'm sorry I'm making stupid jokes, but here's the truth: you walk, in the snow, in a barren landscape, picking up the pieces of a tragedy that happened years ago, while something sinister stalks you. It's creepy. It's sad. It's bleak.  But it was thoroughly enjoyable for me. No, it's not a game everybody will like. Yes: I highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "If the graphics was the only thing that mattered, then Kholat would be a tremendous success. Seriously the game looks beautiful (especially for an indie open world game). But the most important thing is the gameplay and this game is sadly severely lacking in content. The world is absolutely barren, there is nothing but you and the ocasional shadowy figure which kills you instantly if you come too close. You are no fighter, you even lack the ability to jump, which prevents you from entering areas, which any normal human being should be able to access. The only thing you are allowed to do is collecting diary pages and notes, which gradually unveils the story. Collecting notes is also one of two ways to save the game (the other is fast travel), so it is entirely possible to scout out a large portion of the map without saving only to die and have to do it all over again. Combine this with an absolutely dreadful map system and you have a very irritating game. Yes, you have a map, but it's inefficient at best. It doesn't show your position and you cannot put any notes on it (missed opportunity). Sometimes you find coordinates, which tells you your position. But all this effort just isn't worth it, I ditched the map very quickly and managed relatively fine, I mean the world isn't that big. Way to make a big portion of the game irrelevant.  Running is as you might have already figured out your main activity in this game. But your stamina is very very low, run for too long and your wision becomes blurry, which forces you to stop. So learning how to sprint in short bursts becomes essential. Let's return to the shadows/ghosts or whatever they are. They are very easy to see, because they leave behind bright orange footsteps. But sneaking around them can be tricky because there is no stealth system, one time I've been hidden in a bush and was detected, other time I stood in plain sight an wasn't detected. So the only thing that triggers their AI is proximity. Keep your distance and they will never be a threat to you. But if you trigger them, you can run away from them, if you react quickly. Hovewer, this usually involves running away from the direction you were going, and you might end up in a completely different area then you wanted to. This is probably the only time, where the coordinates scatered throughout the world will actually come in handy.  So, we've established that this game doesn't offer too much in the gameplay area, the main focus must be the story. The story, which is told throughout the notes, it ranges from diary pages of the Dyatlov expedition, to insane ramblings which make everything more confusing. Instead of bringing answers, everything you read/witness raises more questions. It does hovewer a decent job describing the Dyatlov incident at the beginning.  Let's sum this up- this game lacks in gameplay, lacks in storytelling, the map system is tedious, the world looks nice but is completely empty. You have to ask yourself, is that worth the asking price?",

It's not going to be around much longer (victory is near!). I've gotten alot of notes, reports and journals but might finish the game with a few missed, although I think I've gotten enough out of the story. Also have all but one tent location it seems. Anyways, time for a review!   This is a pretty solid survival/adventure game. Kholat is somewhat creepy, tense and grinding because of the atmosphere, constant snow and chase sequences. It does have a couple of good jumps and a few areas are downright intense because you're racing against time to keep out of the clutches of an instant death mist that's chasing you. So the gist of the gameplay is that you're running around on a snow-covered mountain where things aren't as they seem and a bunch of supernatural goings on are occuring trying to piece the a story together by collecting as much written information as you can. The last folks that traversed this mountainous impasse didn't make it back alive to tell their story.   The game isn't flawless that's for sure, but I enjoyed alot of it. It's like a point and click adventure with light elements of Amnesia and Outlast, because you can die and you will die as you trial n' error your way to each key location. The game is immersive enough that you really feel like you're lost in the mountains, freezing to death and all around completely ******. After some frustration I was able to successfully use the map to figure out where I was at and where I needed to go. You basically gather your bearings at different base camps before setting out on the next hunt for reports, diaries and journals. Along the way you will traverse mountains, valleys, forests, stumble on a few signs of where life once was and encounter numerous one hit obstacles that will render you dead,   The graphics and atmosphere are great. This game grinds in much of the way that the highly underrated Cursed Mountain did and feels a bit like John Carpenter's The Thing. The landscapes are beautiful to behold and even though the map is not quite as huge and daunting as you initially think, there's a good sense of vastness and scope that really puts you into the heart of adventure. The story unfolds in semi-confusing bits of prose narrated by Sean Bean, a female actor and yourself. Due to the difficulty of travel, there is a sense of accomplishment when you successfully reach new locations and landmarks, and even though the pace is a ruthless slow burn, it's dangerous and fun. The map/compass system is challenging. As a dogged old school gamer I figured it out with no videos, walkthroughs or otherwise and it took me time. This game makes you feel lost, isolated and generally f*cked but the more you play and discover things, the more the map fills in and becomes easier to navigate.   Sound design deserves a special mention here because it's probably creepier than the actual evil spirits you're up against. You will hear different cues providing clues to what situations, discoveries and key locations are nearby. As I first played the game I found myself running everytime I heard one of these sounds thinking I was about to be attacked. Eventually, I figured out that these were things I was supposed to stop and take notice of, so keep your ears open while playing this one (not just for monsters!). Never before in a game did I get friggen excited over the sound of a rustling piece of paper, but Kholat makes you yearn for minute pleasures. These cues also provide the location of game saving tents and I had no crashes or problems in terms of saving (knock on wood) 5 hours into the game thus far. Though glitches do occur.   Unfortunately, Kholat is not without its negatives. While the save system wasn't a problem for me and was just spaced out enough for my liking, prepare for some cheap deaths. As an adventurer, I think it was a little bit silly that you couldn't jump. I do understand that not being able to jump made travel more difficult, but it was somewhat nagging when you couldn't hurdle a two foot ledge. I died a decent amount during Kholat. Sometimes warranted and sometimes very cheaply. I stepped on a ghosts head that was stuck in the ground because of a glitch, died descending ledges that the game didn't want you to go down and ended up dead because the game would be playing smoothly one minute with alot going on and lagging like hellfire the next. Though I never lost large amounts of progress, there are certainly some ludicrous things that will kill you, so prepare to do things over a few times even if the cause of your demise was completely out of your control.   Though some runs for key story pages are tense and exciting (the forest), the enemies are kinda stupid. There is no stealth system whatsoever to avoid them. They killed me far away and out of sight, chased me to the ends of areas and other irritating stuff. You can stun them with your flashlight, but it's never worth it. The spirits don't provide too many problems and can be easily avoided the majority of the time, yet other times you will die at their hands while cursing the very mountain you're climbing. They weren't a particularly interesting opponent either and sometimes were so stupid they wouldn't bother you if you walked by them right in their field of view. The whole system was somewhat poorly implemented in my opinion and definitely a major buzzkill on the tension. A few other cheap one hit kills will take you down. For example, I got hit by the same falling rock 3 times a row, and whether I'd wait, rush or run, the game would lag up and I'd get killed. I passed that part by luck and luck alone. Thankfully, none of this stuff puts you so far backwards that it's game-breaking, just rather cheap, laggy and poorly conceived.   The story is solidly narrated but is mostly confusing. Those hammy diatribes and goofy bits of poetry don't make much sense even if Bean did a good job with the narration. It just doesn't make alot of sense and I found myself less involved with what was going on with each passing journal page instead of becoming more intensely engrossed. Despite the story being rather overblown and not so well-written, the desire to push on and see what location is ahead more than made up for the yarn not pulling the gamer in as much as it should.   Overall, Kholat has been an enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to wrapping it up either later tonight or tomorrow. I don't think the couple of things left to do would change my score drastically, because I know endings are not usually all they're cracked up to be and it's the gameplay itself that concerns me. Did I have fun playing Kholat? Yes. Was it a perfect game? No. Will I pick it up a second time fro the beginning? No. But do I regret spending the money? No, not at all! A good horror themed game for players that would rather the scares come from the atmosphere than a bunch of silly jump-gimmicks. Pure adventure fans might find it worth a look as well.   Here's the breakdown:   Pros:   -Excellent graphics -Sound design is not only top-notch but important for gameplay -Solid voice acting -Overbearing sense of dread and isolation like a good horror flick -Exploration is mostly fun -Cool compass/map system (You really do feel like you're lost and trying to find your way) -Some solid set-pieces and chase sequences  Cons -Laggy gameplay can lead to cheap deaths -Boring enemies with awful AI will either stupidly ignore you or murder you ruthlessly -Muddled story -Could use more actions (jump, climb) -Limited tasks/objectives leads to some tedium late game -No stealth system when stealth is part of your mission  Overal rating: 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "Kholat is a great horror game at heart, although most of the time is spent wondering around, when the horror kicks in it can be genuinely scary especially when played in the dark with a headset. I imagine it would be a game better spent with VR but that goes for a lot of walking simulator/horror games. It can be frustrating though as most of the time spent playing your trying to find the next location to carry on the story, this is caused by annoying game mechanics. The only way to open the map is by finding a tent when it would have been much easier to just open it up at any time while your wondering around. Tha game would probably have took half the time to complete if you could open the map whenever you wanted. The story is good, the narration is great and the visuals and sound design are also very good. It's well worth playing if your into horror games but it does require some patience to complete the story.",
