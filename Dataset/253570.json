            "review_text": "I felt the need to review this game, because I bought this in a bundle, read the (strongly negative) reviews, and played it anyways.  I had two friends over and fired this up with me on the laptop, a logitech controller, and a wireless keyboard for our mixed controllers. And you know what?  We had a lot of fun.  No online multiplayer and no bots- these are two very common complaints. Having played the game, though, I realize that neither is a good fit for the game. It's too quick and frantic for bots, and being killed by bots would be infuriating. It would be like playing Mario Party with bots- not really fun, just annoying no matter what level they're on. Online multiplayer could work, but it's more of that 'party game' feel, where yelling at your friends and swearing is a huge part of the fun.  The only other complaints I've heard are these:  Not a lot of variety- True. It doesn't have the variety of gameplay that Super Smash Brothers might, but it's also much less expensive. You won't clock in as many hours here, but you'll get a couple.  No Quit Button- legitimate complaint, but is fixed now.  Conclusion- I got this in a bundle, and it easily was the best game of the bunch. If you like local multiplayer and frantic gameplay, this one's worth buying on a sale or in a bundle, and even full price, I doubt you'll be disappointed. Get some USB controllers and a couple friends that you don't mind swearing like a sailor with.",
