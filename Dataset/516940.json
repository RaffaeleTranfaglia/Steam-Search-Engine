            "review_text": "Definitely needs polishing, but it's good and simple. I love the controller models, they're perfect and add a nice touch of immersion. The assets are nice and it runs exactly how minesweeper should, this was a perfect game to bring to VR.  Things I would change about this:  Despawn the debris when you start a new game, or lock the axis of the board pieces. The debris will actually move around the board pieces when starting a new round, so the player will have to keep starting over until the debris is out of the way.  UI. Navigating through the barebones UI is terribly confusing and could be solved with a simple point and click menu. You shouldn't have to make use of every single button to start a game. Also, a quick restart button would be nice.  Simple hovering text over buttons whilst on a menu screen would make learning the controls 10 times easier. A player shouldn't have to take of their headset in order to re-read control schemes.  Also, check your GUI layers. Several textboxes are on a layer above the gameobjects.",
