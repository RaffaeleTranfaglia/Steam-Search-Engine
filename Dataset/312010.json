All you have to do is revenge the murder of your father, killed by a psychopathic ostrich. During the game you can get new rifles and shotguns, more and more powerful (it's even possible to purchase a minigun!), leading an incredible bird hunt. Shoot pigeons, ducks, cormorants, hens, turkeys, kamikaze birds, owls and ostrichs until you don't get to your main prey.  Well, the finale is predictable, isn't it? You manage to avenge your father, yahoo!, now he can rest in peace etc.  So, if you want to play it, I suggest you to eliminate save data, or you'll get bored very soon.",
