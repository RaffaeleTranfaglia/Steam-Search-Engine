Having to look up how to develop film comes to mind. If you want to play one of the grandfthers of Cthulhu Mythos Games, this is it, besides the OG Alone in the Dark. There are a lot worse things to spend 6 bucks on, just try not to take it as seriously as it tries to present itself. It's a tad too silly to take seriouslyat times, such as literally flying. I'll let you decide WHICH time Parker flies I'm talking about.  Seriously, though, Steam, the guy's name is 'Parker'.",
