            "review_text": "I had high expectations for Nicole after reading the positive reviews on it. However, I was highly disappointed within the first 5 minutes of playing it. The writing is extremely cheesy, like a middle-school girl writing fanfiction. I did my best to overlook it and continued playing through 3 of the 4 character routes. It's very obvious in the beginning who the culprit is, and each character has a stereotypical personality. The only one I particularly liked throughout the progression was Ted and maybe Darren. It was very difficult to find Jeff or Kurt appealing. The story is brief and non-engaging, and I felt like there wasn't much to explore, even with the dialogue options. It was very linear and tedious, what with the last month having nothing to do but gather clues and randomly clicking activities just to get the days over with. It was such a pain to go through that since there were no more stories or events going on for that whole month. Even the ending was quick and unsatisfying. Another problem was that the characters all pretty much looked the same aside from Darren. And Nicole? She's really pretty but her personality just made me cringe half the time.  Aside from that, I found myself enjoying it when I went through Darren's route and Ted's. I was just irritated that the story halted for that month as if they ran out of ideas. The game seemed very half-♥♥♥♥♥, and the after school 'activities' were horribly boring.  On a good note, I enjoyed the art, and the story wasn't too bad. The music was nice and set up a pleasant ambience, though I don't particulary pay any attention to that for more than a few seconds. All in all, Nicole is a very lacking game that is definitely not worth $20. I have quite a bit of regret spending that much on such a short game with little to do aside from clicking what stat you want to raise. Over. And over. And over.  If it ever drops to at most 10 bucks, I'd recommend it then.",

            "review_text": "The writing is *painful*. The primary appeal of this genre is in the writing and development of different plot threads. I understand that college is an awkward experience for many people, especially women, who have to deal with misogyny, sexual violence, and any number of other threats. But nothing is *this* awkward.  I look forward to the developer trying again.",

            "review_text": "I've finished the game for all normal, special, and other endings - takes about 15 hours. Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I thought the writing was great. Nicole seemed like your modern day college student. Her wit was memorable, and I'm pleased that she had faults as well, giving her a more well-rounded personality.  The mystery was not particularly difficult to figure out, but seeing how each romance dealt with it was entertaining. There were some creepy moments throughout the game - nothing scary, but it was still well done.  I suppose if I had to change something about the game, it would be less repitition. Your entire semester is identical for each path, so you start to skip the dialogues and scenes. Short of zeroing in on one of the boys' paths, there was no deviation. I felt like that may have been the intention at one point during development (Nicole breaks the fourth wall and tells you who one of the characters are - but you already know this because you've been forced to play those scenes already).  I also would have preferred more choices. It's a massive grind to get your clues and primary stat up, and I think more dialogue choices would have helped with that. Overall though, I really liked playing it and would recommend it to others interested in visual novels.",

Pros:   -Unique premise (solving a mystery whilst looking for love) -Great background art -Characters have multiple outfits for different occasions   Cons:   -Overly snarky, unlikable characters ( especially  the MC) -Painfully obvious mystery (you'll know as soon as you meet him which guy is the kidnapper) -Cheesy dialogue filled with lame pop culture references (eg.  Marble Hornets  is called 'Rock Wasps') -Monotonous stat raising  -Generic music  For just under twenty dollars, there are way better otome games you can find on Steam.",

            "review_text": "A fun game if you don't mind some stat building along with your storylines. I liked the art and generally liked the characters and text. The main character was better than many. I agree with the review that said this is a solid addition to any otome collection. It gets a little repetitive while trying to get all the endings, but the different scenes for each storyline are worth it and you can save partway through so that you don't have to necessarily go back to Day 1 every time.  One important comment... I did get some glitches with the game endings. As somebody else said, you have to be a bit careful about getting the stats and relationships to the right levels at the right times (which I gather may be a platform issue, but I'm not sure). That happened to me and was frustrating, but I did get it work so that my subsequent playthroughs were no problem. I'm surprised there weren't more comments on that problem in the Steam discussion forum for the game.  Overall, I'd say content was good, art was good; a solid 8/10 for me (I had fun playing). Music was generally appropriate and added to the game.",
