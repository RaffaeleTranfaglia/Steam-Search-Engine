            "review_text": "Oh man, Payday: The Heist... This game carries so many memories for me. I know it's old, and the community isn't really all that active anymore, but this game still kicks ♥♥♥. Now, this isn't PAYDAY 2. You won't spend very much time devising plans or sneaking around (more on that later), but instead, you have a clear objective, and then you let all hell loose with some kickass weapons. So, is this game for you? But isn't PAYDAY 2 so much better? Well, let me break this down.  In general, PAYDAY 2 has a more 'realistic' feel, with your characters movement and weapons being a little less arcadey, and more down to earth. Payday: The Heist is exactly the opposite, and it's still great. Characters are fast, weapons have dead point accuracy (most of the time, not always) and in general it's trying to make you feel as little vulnerability as possible. And although you could argue about which is better, there's no denying it feels pretty badass.  Another key difference is that one of PAYDAY 2's main selling points is that things within the heists switch around, making things more unique. The original lacks this in every single heist but one (which is my favourite, personally) and it does definitely wear on you after a while, however if your anything like me you'll play them again just because it's fun.  I'm almost done with comparisons! Another big one is that outside of the beggining of two heists, there's no stealth, only guns blazing. So if your really into stealth, you'll probably prefer PAYDAY 2.  And finally, the upgrade system. In PAYDAY 2, upgrading is quite complex. You have skill trees, even skill decks for bonuses, individual weapon upgrades, etc, making a very deep (albeit sometimes confusing) way to make your character powerful. The original streamlines this: All you have to do is pick which tree to advance in, and as you level up you get things from that tree (like weapons, perks, bonuses, etc.), with you being able to switch between trees at any time.  So that's it with comparisons. So how's the actualy game itself?  It's fast, furious, difficult, and just plain amazing. Assuming you get the Wolfpack DLC (which I highly reccomend) you have 4 skill trees, 9 heists, and all in all a ton of fun. I only have ONE WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ALONE! The AI is so stupid it's embarrasing. You can do it for bragging rights, or for practice, but this game needs to be played with other people, so get a team.  Regarding the community, outside of Europe not that many people play it, so I suggest getting a 4-pack and playing it with friends.  And that's my review! Hopefully you now understand which PAYDAY game is for you! (I reccomend getting both, if you can)  FINAL SUMMARY: This game, and it's sequel, are amazing. Fantastic gameplay, great dev's, and hours upon hours of fun. Just don't do it alone!",

            "review_text": "When I got PAYDAY 1 on a steam sale, I didn't play it till my friends got it. And now it's one of my favorite games. Even though PAYDAY 2 is out and I find that game really fun, I still come back to this game because the 2 games have 2 different play styles. PAYDAY 2 is more realisic and strategic, while PAYDAY 1 feels like it's more Left 4 Dead or Mass Effect 3 multiplyer. It also feels more fast paced, sending larger waves of enemies in maps that offer poor cover causing the player to use their unlimited sprint, and 0 reduction on your speed due to the armor you must wear to survive, to dodge and return fire on maps that contain both close and long range encounters. Both of the PAYDAY games are on my list of best games I've ever played.  I highly recommend these games.",

            "review_text": "Imagine Left 4 Dead except you're shooting cops instead of zombies.  There's a level progression system in the game just like in the sequel, but you don't have to worry about any of the RPG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t elements, just level up and spend points. Imagine more like Killing Floor where playing the game gives you progress on each class. You can grind it out to get there faster, but that'll go against what the game's pushing you towards.  People say it's comparable to Payday 2 in that they're the same characters and world, etc. They're wrong. The game is paced completely differently: heists aren't meant to be quick in-and-out situations, they're long, gruelling marathons you have to push through. They also don't function on an 'all or nothing' reward system. If you fail right at the end, that's okay, you still get money (experience) for every objective you completed along the way. It's not as rage inducing as ♥♥♥♥ing up a Big Bank stealth right as you're opening the vault, then having to run and get the god damn drill because alarms went off.  That's another thing, there's not really stealth save for one or two missions. Don't be a ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥. When you ask yourself 'Are we rushin' in, or are we goin in sneakypeaky like?', the answer should always be the former. Stealth in this game is a lot harder, and it's more of a dickwaving contest kind of situation when you can stealth the few maps, rather than being the optimal strategy necessarily.  Overall, it's worth picking up even if you have Payday 2. It's not like the Left 4 Dead series in the regards that L4D2 replaces the 1st in every way, they're just completely different games with different mechanics.",

Concept  Pros  Cons    Stealth  Progressing stealth wise removes steps you would have to take otherwise in order to complete the mission, which means that going stealth at first is always worth trying  Everyone has a heart monitor, so even killing a single person will alert the cops    Leveling up!   No need for +1 mushrooms, or investing wisely, you can simply level everything up!       Challenge Yourself   Challenges that help you level up and gain money, which encourages trying different game play styles to be well rounded   They didn't continue this idea in payday 2 (odd to put this as a con here)    To Reset or ...  Single Player there is a reset button  There is no choice in multiplayer, you need to go back to lobby, only singleplayer oddly has a quick reset button     DLC   There is a total of 1 DLC and a soundtrack  No DLC to make stealth viable for a noob like me...         Gameplay  Pros  Cons    Stealth  Stealth is challenging  Being spotted by a guard means you instantly lose at stealth regardless of how you react    Aim for the Stars  The guns accuracy seems really good when your shooting from hip   I looked at my accuracy and was horrified    Revive!  Either dash to revive a teammate or take a hostage and trade them, really adds usefulness to hostages  Anytime I take out my flip phone to talk to the cops for the trade, the hostages laugh at me, so i end up shooting them...     Interact-able Objectives  Taking drills and blowing vaults open, throwing down sentries, or answering phone calls, there is always something to mess u...with  When your the person who lets go of the button or dies before it can complete the process    ",

I remember buying it because of one thing, dynamics. The conditions in a heist, will change. From small things like location of items or chance of extra loot to spawn, to something larger like an entire room full of cash. The feel of the game is there and the change in the game itself make it feel fresh, even after dozens of play troughs. Also, there are different forms of 'heists' in the game. Most are simply 'go in and grab money/items' but others are 'escort person from A to B', but don't let that 'A to B' analogy fool you in thinking it it easy *cough* Green Bridge *cough*.  Anyway, this is just a great game to play either solo or with friends. The only down side would be that the number of people playing it, has gone down but it is a tough yet entertaining game. There are a few minor features here and there that are a pain, and are improved in Payday 2, but the vast majority of the game features, are all here. Even the DLC is very well done and I HIGHLY recommend buying it as well.",

However, once you've put in some time and level up, you become better able to survive and succeed. The game's general tempo is great, you're running around on this map constantly under pressure from the police, and periodically they'll send in tougher waves with special enemies like the 'Bulldozer' (a super-armored SWAT trooper), 'Shield' (a trooper with a riot shield, naturally), and 'Cloaker' (a stealthy spec-ops type). There are three 'classes' in the game: assault, sharpshooter, and support. While the difference between them is at first only the guns they use, as you complete missions you'll level up each class and earn more benefits. However, there's not really a system where you pick and choose your benefits: it's straight up 'higher level = better', with no balances at all. One major aspect of the game's 'crime' theme is the hostage concept. Civilians litter each level; shooting them causes police to act more aggressively, but they can be shouted down and zip tied to be used as hostages. If a player-character is caught by the police, they can be traded for a hostage, so in a sense hostages act as 'extra lives'. However, the police will also be trying to rescue the hostages, so maintaining control of them is critical. ",

There are no micro-payments, no skins. Just you, your buddies and your gun. Also, the difficulty is much higher, you actually have to be good at the game to play on Overkill difficulty! And no OP DLC will help you overcome that problem. Speaking of DLC. there is only one availible, and it adds much more than so called 'DLC's' or money grabs in PD2. It adds 2 new heists, new unlocks, new weapons and the best part is that if your friends don't have the DLC maps they can still play with you if one player has the DLC! The levels are challenging and fun, the gameplay feels more tactical and Co-Op focused. I strongly reccomend this game over the 'sequel'.",

It is much more loud oriented and doesn't have much stealth in it, but makes working with your teammates to complete tough missions more satisfying.  Final Grade: 7 / 10 jammed drills",

There is frequently a feeling of 'what do I do next?” with inadequate guidance from the game. It helps to play with experienced players, but when you do, you're dragging your team down because you don't have all the levelling perks that they do.  There also seem to be many ways to game each level. Beating levels seems to be less about adapting on the fly, and more about knowing exactly where to hide out while you're waiting for events to happen. And you do spend a lot of time in this game waiting for stuff to happen.  But past the flaws, Payday is a game with a cheap $20 price tag. There is a certain breeziness to the gameplay that's just a rollicking good time. The harder difficulty levels require teamwork and planning, which I appreciate. Payday delivers a satisfying co-op experience, of which there are too few today. Really – if judged solely for its “co-op-iness”, this game is top-flight… playing on a well-coordinated team is a great experience.  I want to mention that you kill a lot of cops in Payday. A lot. There's no stealth element here. Through the years, shooters have given us a variety of enemies to gun down of increasingly human-like appearance: Aliens, robots, zombies, soldiers. Criminals occasionally appeared, especially mobsters. But cops? These aren't even 'corrupt cops.” Call me squeamish, but I find this ... distasteful.  All in all, Payday is a good game, even if it’s a bit rough around the edges. The soon-to-be-released sequel appears to be a much more ambitious effort. I hope the developers will be able to apply what they’ve learned from this game to the new one. ",

Only buy this if you love fixing Drills for days!  Overall I recommened you buy this even if you don't like FPS's because you'll love this and I'll tell you why in the pros and cons:  Pros: ♦ AI that seem to just work (This makes for an epic single player experience) ♦ Huge amount of challenges, upgrades and unlockables (This is awesome for replay abilities) ♦ Amazing Achievements (These are the right balance of difficulty and help keep the game fresh) ♦ Graphics seem okay (Graphics could be slightly better, but for what they are, they are pretty good and suit the game) ♦ Voice Acting that's on point (Heaps of games lack voice acting but this one has everything voice acted to a T which enhances every heist that little bit more) ♦ Nice number of Masks and Playable Characters ♦ Only 2 paid DLC not 10 million like Payday 2 (Payday 2 has way too much pointless DLC) ♦ DLC that isn't just Skins (This is awesome as most paid DLC these days for games are just skins and not actual content, but this DLC expands the game and is well worth buying) ♦ Multiplayer server and hosting that just works (One of the best servers I've played on in terms of being able to host and have people play with little to no lag) ♦ Ingame Microphone (Every multiplayer game should have one of these, being able to rage at peole for dying is soo good) ♦ Awesome number of difficulties (Overkill is a bit exessive but it's worth the challenge for us pros) ♦ Good amount of Missions/Objectives per Heist (Isn't too many and isn't too few, just a great balanced amount)  Cons: ♦ Not many Heist Maps (This isn't really a problem due to the number of achievements, challenges and unlockables each map has... But after you do each heist map it can feel repetitive eventually due to the lack of Heist Maps to grind on) ♦ Eventually it turns into a grind (Once you've got the initial achievements and challenges it turns into a grind of doing the same heist over and over again just to unlock that next challenge, upgrade, unlockable or the next achievement) ♦ No tutorial to explain what is going on (It is pretty easy to pick up, but for a first timer it can be pretty daunting, I didn't know we could switch classes by tab until way into playing for example) ♦ Restoring Power within 5 seconds to get the achievement on No Mercy too hard (This seems almost impossible as you never know which power switch you have to press to turn back on and some are ages away...)  Overall, if you like Drill Fixing Simulators I suggest you buy this now, don't hesitate. But in all honesty there are way more Pros than Cons and the cons aren't even that bad. So, if you like FPS's that have a huge amount of challenges, upgrades, unlockables, achievements that you can play both online with friends and offline by yourself with epic AI this is for you,,, even if you don't, I'm sure this game will make you enjoy FPS's.   I give this a 9/10 (If you ignore the slight grinding once you get to a certain point, lack of tutorial and the fact there are not many Heist Maps... then it'd be a solid 10/10).",

I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out. Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. When a Rambo tries to run into the open, and play the bad-♥♥♥, they end up getting horribly ♥♥♥♥♥, arrested, and then left behind as his teammates progress through the stage. The game just has a really intense feel as you yell at civilians to drop to the floor and shoot out surveillance cameras in preparation for police arrival. I have seen quite a few complaints about the AI being 'too sentry,' but imo, it is very realistic. The task force units feel professional and trained as I would expect any officer charging into a bank heist, or general hostage situation, would be. However, they are quite careless about shooting around civilians and you will often find yourself feeling like you are trying to save innocents from a reckless police riot. This game is made to be a Pure Teamwork Tactic and it's very important to make strategy and then excecute the plan, overall. Don't buy this game if you don't have friends to play with, sincerely you'll face having a hard time in heist. I recommend you should play in Co-op with your friends because of the needs to stick together, tactics and teamwork.  Rated: 9.4/10 ",

If you like a fast-paced, first person, team based game that relies heavy on team work (rambos need not apply), then I suggest giving this game a try. The devs are in the Steam forums always getting community feedback and supporting their game and even recently added more free content -a new map/mission that they did with Valve (No Mercy- L4D level done the payday way ;) ).   I love great games like these, (I've never had a bug) that are released and not abandoned by the developer shortly after release. This one is still getting the love.

            "review_text": "HANDS UP! ON THE GROUND!   PAYDAY: The Heist is one of the best co-op experiences I've had in my life. Even though it has a very limited amount of heists to perform, it has a great value of re-playability. Many of the primary events in each heist are randomized to make each game different.  Regarding the engine, it is superb. Loads really fast, looks good, and feels great. It may have some bugs but considering this was all done by an indie company this is an outstanding job.   The concept behind the game is simple, yet never seen before-- I can't believe they never made a game like this one. There are different heists, one at a bank, with a lot of shootout, other in a secret vault raid in the middle of the night, which has to be silent without setting off alarms, and so on. Each one is played in a different setting.  It also has a great deal of collectibles; there are several masks which can be unlocked throughout the game by doing stuff like reaching a level, finishing a mission, completing a challenge, or finding an Easter egg or a secret.  What's the best about this game? The Easter eggs and references to other elements in pop culture. The first mission is like the movie 'Heat', there are other elements which remind you of 'The Dark Knight'; but the most remarkable of them is the joint operation done by OVERKILL with VALVe to bring a mission set in Left 4 Dead's Mercy Hospital, which hints the beginning of the zombie outbreak.  OVERKILL also designed many Alternate Reality Games inside the game. For instance, the PAYDAY Secret, also known as OVERDRILL, was one of the most important events in the game so far; and the rewarding feeling that many players had while unraveling the secret, is now paid by OVERKILL with a commemorative plaque inside the so called Overvault, with the names of the people who first discovered the secret.  Overall, and even though the game is short and maybe not graphically perfect-- yet it looks very good--, this game is an excellent game and a must have. And if you get the Wolf Pack DLC it's even better, because it expands the game with two more missions and a whole new class to level up, as well as 48 new levels.  Go and grab it on my mark...

Although a great game, it is quite difficult to play on higher difficulties with the team A.I., who possess about as much intelligence as a Call of Duty 10 year old. Due to this, PLAY THIS GAME WITH FRIENDS!    The skill trees are also quite simple, requiring only that you pick one of four and level up while it is selected. As far as enemies go, this game is like Left 4 Dead with hordes of gun toting police rather than zombies. There are even four types of special enemies too, that are just as much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ as the special infected are in Left 4 Dead. There is not much of a story other than staging and pulling off large heists, but the heists are nonetheless quite rewarding and satisfying to pull off.   Overall, this is a great game marred slightly by extremely poor A.I. I would highly recommend this game to anyone wanting an 'arcadey' shooter that is enjoyable with friends. Finally, as I have stated before, if you want to play on higher difficulties with greater ease (or at all, in some cases), PLAY WITH FRIENDS!   P.S.: Unlike Payday 2, Overkill did not go overkill (hah!) on the random dlcs and constant, slow updates. You shall have no fear of crashing during the tail end of a three day heist for weeks on end due to a poor update for a dlc containing useless, overpriced trinkets.

Ammo is limited, targeting is shakey and inconsistent, and as if those weren't enough, pressing F to get people to move on this game, is probably one of the most annoying things I've ever experienced in a video game.

It doesn't even feel like a proper heist game anymore, if anything, it's like Left 4 Dead 2 with cops at this point with an obvious homage to classic heist films.   The combat and premise is rather generic at this point, but the game as a whole has a certain charm to it that makes it special. Maybe it's the music, maybe it's the cheesy dialogue, or maybe its the memorable missions. Regardless, this game is outstanding.  TL;DR While it may not be as polished by today's standards, this charming little game is still worth the money to this day.

However, if you want to play online with other people this is not your game. So many people have left this game for payday 2 so there are little to no players hosting a game. However, if your a person who likes to 100% complete game achievements, this is your game this game offers the hardest achievements to unlock( In my opinion) but when done brings a lot of satisfaction to one self. Take it from me i recommend this game to anyone looking to play with friends on game night or just spending some time killing off waves of AI. Just keep in mind online gameplay isn't the strong suit of this game anymore but out of everything i give it a 8/10 for 2016.",

It has been destroyed by DLC and micro-transactions, the community is almost worse than CS:GO, and you will spend A LOT of pointless monies on it.  Buy Payday: The Heist instead. Even though it features a much smaller community, there is only one DLC. That may sound underwhelming, but it packs on everything the original game was missing, the little it was.   Payday: The Heist is much more challenging, but in a very good way. It adds to the entertainment value, and the replayability. The 9 heists (7 without DLC) are varied and throw many curveballs, but not to the point of redundancy. It succeeds at every facet that Payday 2 failed.  My verdict: Just buy this game. You will not be dissapointed.",

While it has less jobs to do and less weapons to use, it has a good amount of fun in it, a large variety of heists and amazing fun with friends. AI actually works in this one, unlike Payday 2's abysmal attempt at it. This game was free for a day a while ago and when on sale is usually knocked off to about £1.09, which is literally a robbery (see what I did there)  Graphics are great, soundtrack is brilliant and the voice acting is good. Only complaint I really have is the damned invisible snipers that seem to be able to see you from the other side of the map, through a wall. Another problem I have is heists can be a little repetitive, especially the one where you have to find the prisoner in the four trucks. Very difficult to do without friends as the AI will keep clear of you. However, I heartily reccomend this game, because it's just a stupid amount of fun.",

The AI is also very well done, simulating other patients waiting with you. Largely they do absolutely nothing at all, which means they did a great job at those people.

It only has 6 levels (9 if u add the DLCs) but they are really fun and sometimes, you feel like robbing some money and shooting people in the face. (not in real life though xD) If you were thinking of buying Payday 2, DON'T GET PAYDAY 2. PAYDAY THE HEIST!!! This is because Payday 2 is just grind, grind and guess what? Grind. Its just kill, drill, kill, drill, kill and then put you're money in the van.

            "review_text": "Today a friend of mine contacted me. He said that Payday was free. I immediately became hungry. Because Payday is the name of a candy bar. A bunch of sticky sugary peanuts held together by some brown sweet sweet candy like substance. It comes out looking the same as it went in: nutty and firm. Maybe not as tasty anymore though. I like Paydays. They're tasty before your body processes them.  Now this friend wasn't talking about the candybar. He was talking about the game Payday. VERY disappointed. The worst thing that's happened in my miserable life.  So I started to play this free game. Payday is very topical! I wound up joining a game where I was in a hospital. Hospitals are in the news! They keep taking in people infected with ebola, a virus, prescribe them antibiotics, medicine that won't work on viruses, then let them go out into the wild maybe even giving them a free plane ticket and a brocure to some place to ensure the maximum exposure and travel of the disease. Think of all the sick people it would make! Its a diabolical plan to make hospitals rich.  So I find myself in a hopsital with my bros. We have to get blood. This stage is totally about ebola. And then I realized: what am I getting this blood for? Clearly. CLEARLY its to get senpai to notice me. So how do I go about getting this blood? Simple. I grab a purple stuffed bunny (donkey?) and use its vaagina to saw through a door. The door must be made out of ♥♥♥♥ing adumantium, because the saw takes like 10 god damn minutes to cut through.  BAM! We bust through the door and... what the hell kind of hospital uses metal shutters for doors? So of course, we go looking for ebola-chan by sawing through MORE doors made out of the strongest material ever using the crappiest drill ever. But success! We find the infected pastry and extract his sweet sweet jelly filling. Time to  le...oh?  what's that? we can't leave? We have to put the blood in a centerfuge for no good reason? Well, ok. I guess.  I'll have you know I took quantitative analysis in college. I used a centerfuge there. I worked in a hospital. I used centerfuges there as well. It doesn't take long for the actual erythrocytes to separate from the blood plasma. In Payday? It takes like 30 minutes to do this.  ebola must be some crazy ♥♥♥♥ to do that to blood.  What happens next? I don't know. My team and I were killed by the surviving members of the abnormally large army of 53594 armed guards, cops, plainclothes cops, SWAT, bomb squad members, disgruntled TSA employees, NIS, ATF agents, tazer toting mercs from Army of Two, MiB. Not shiatting. Each stage in Payday pits you against an army of angry cops and feds whose numbers are roughly the same as a modern town. Literally 20 cops are pouring out of every air duct in this hospital to get us. I can swear every time I peek around a corner and drop a few, they immediately respawn by the time I finish reloading a peek back around the corner.  Amurkastan. Its a hell of a town. Accurately portrays the police state its turning into.  Sooner or later, Payday. I will get my ebola. And senpai will be pleased enough to take notice of me. And he will wake me up in the morning and call me onii-chan and I will be late for school and run to school still putting on my shoes and with a piece of toast hanging out of my mouth. Just you wait, Payday. Just you wait. I will make you come out the same way you went in.",

            "review_text": "I'll admit, I bought PAYDAY on a whim not expecting that much at it's release. The game sounded interesting, but it was coming from a studio I've not heard from before and while I love some of what SOE's done, they aren't really that well known for retail games. I started up PAYDAY, and started piddling around like I always do.  Originally PAYDAY was kind of a mess. Stability issues were extremely common, leading to frustrating multiplayer experiences along with limited video options available to the player. This felt like a frustrating console port that really didn't play to the PC's strengths and had issues just running in the first place. It was enough for me to shelve it for awhile.  What about now? Well, six months later (yes, I know it's been longer.. shut up) the game has shaped up significantly. More options were exposed to the user including control toggles for movement, the use of sights and an even more awesome and exceedingly well done implementation of Field of View options. While it's difficult to remember just how limited the options were, it's great to see that we have antialiasing, vsync, and detail options that all give a sense of being able to tweak the game to compromise performance and quality based on your own preferences. What's even better is that after this six month simmer period, the game runs beautifully. It's smooth, silky smooth. No hardware replacements on my end, it's just plain awesome. I'm not fighting framerate drops even during the busiest moments and I don't feel like the controls are my enemy as a result.  While most people compare PAYDAY to Left 4 Dead, I find it hard to make that comparison beyond the fact that it shares some gameplay elements. Squad of four, special 'infected' or Police units really is the extent of the similarities (barring any hint at zombie involvement after this review). The game is much more about control of key areas, as far as I've experienced, and less about just simply running and gunning. Sure there's 'Heat Street' which does kind of push for running and gunning, but at the same time the 'weight' of various mechanics just change your mindset to seeking and staying in cover and making a move when you know you won't take much flak for it.  One thing I've always liked about Payday is it's over-the-top response by Law Enforcement. Even with my first experience back in October on First World Bank, I remember staring out the front doors of the bank after finding the last pesky camera to see NYPD squad cars slide in to view with officers jumping out. I recall seeing police officers running by the bullet-proof glass as they made their way to various entrances and I recall the almost perfect escalation of force that was so appropriate for the level.  There are a LOT of little details that make you smile after having seen some of the movies in which the game takes a good deal from, but it's not just animations, style, or heists that borrow from that. There's even a neat-o filter that changes the color palette based on whatever you happen to choose. From movies such as Black Hawk Down all the way to The Matrix, it really can add more to the game's presentation if you let it. Amusingly enough OVERKILL saw fit to add even a few nods at the industry's habits with filters such as 'NextGen Brown' which add a hefty amount of brown as a nod to the Call of Duty, Battlefield, Gears of War, and other modern shooters.  The game isn't perfect, but as a start, it bodes well for OVERKILL. The amount of suggestions and feedback acted on by the developers has shown that not only have they learned a great deal, that they're truly trying to make games that are enjoyable within the scope of what they're aiming for. PAYDAY: The Heist is a great game and for $20, you would have a hard time finding better.",

I admit I find it boring playing the same levels OVER and OVER, but to some it may be enjoyable. Also I don't like the feel of the guns. I admit I am 'picky' with the feel of my guns, they need to have weight behind them, and with PAYDAY most guns don't have that. Unloading my rifle feels like shooting a NERF gun. The shotgun feels like getting the last bit of catsup out of the bottle. All other guns are the same except for maybe the AK (Wolfpack DLC only) and the Bronco/revolver.

Some of the things in game to help make it a challange is the limited ammo and health making the game more intense and still allowing a surviving challenge while playing. The campaign map also changes certain elements randomly so there's always a replay value along with the game making it even more fun and focing you to change up your tactics each time. I also think that in the next payday they will do more to make the game story a little more intersting. As of now its pretty basic and bland but with all the Leveling of Rep for new items and the changing game play makes up for the lack of storyline involed in the game. I suggest getting this game and playing it then when the next one comes out GRAB IT, you will want to. I am looking forward on seeing the more detailed storyline in the next one so we all learn a little more about the 'eye in the sky' who is helping these guys. :)",

There are very few multiplayer games that are fun to play by themselves and sadly Payday are one of those games. Despite that it is fun to play with friends.  8/10 A fun co-operative shooter with fun missions, good quality gameplay, and a unique setting to fix that heist itch.

These cop zombies however get dropped down with helicopters, use vents or 6 conveniently placed elevators to pop up right besides or even right on top of you. Then they usually drop a smoke and about 50-100 cops will come at you. Just simply overpowering you with numbers. Even battle tactics get lost in here.  Then there is the leveling system which is just very vague. Everyone at level 1 starts out with the same setup, but you will level up with the class you have selected and can get the set bonusus when you reach a certain level within that class. It just doesn't work that well, you cant really create your own class. It would have been much better and clearer if they would simply have gone with the talent/skill trees you see in most games.  It had some potential, but it just never fullfilled it. Atleast this game helped them finance the game they ACTUALLY wanted to make. They never planned to make Payday the way this game is made. They just simply didnt had the means to do what they wanted, so they went with a simple game. And whats more simply to just throw hoards of cops at players? But I've heard Payday 2 is a lot better, so really... dont waste your time on this one! If you want to rob banks take a look at Payday 2 instead, I've heard its pretty good.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

In the spirit of any Valve game worth its salt (although the game itself is NOT made by Valve), you have a decently sized arsenal of weapons and equipment that hold distinct purposes for different situations, and the various enemy types are distinct from one another that you can identify them at a glance. The level up system is fun if a bit grindy and until you get to Reputation 145, everyone's builds will be vastly different.  The most negative part of this game is that (aside from being inferior to its sequel in basically every regard; again, much like Left 4 Dead to its sequel.) the level grinding will overstay its welcome, and unless you're a diehard player, you won't get your character to Reputation 145. The stealth aspect of the Diamond Heist is also a bit dodgy, which is infuriating when you're trying to grab all the sapphires and go for the Big Diamond, the latter of which has an RNG element even on the higher difficulties, which is a cardinal sin.   That being said, if you're looking for a robust shooter or just a big fan of Ocean's Eleven, then this game (and more specifically its sequel) will satisfy.",

Besides Payday 1 needs more players, too often I have to wait 15 minutes for 1 person to join lobby. Sorry for bad english ~Ryba",

At the end I bought it, because a friend had it and he said it was a good game. OH MY GOD, after I played it an hour I realized how awesome this game is. The idea of doing heists is just a very good idea for a game. Fortunately, there is an AI-Director like in l4d2, that means that every time, the situation will be different (for example the bank manager will be at another place etc.) Also, if you kill civilians, more cops will come (and stronger types of cops, such as SWAT or special units). That means that the heists will never get boring. The game play is exactly what you want from a FPS, the weapons feel great and the controls are precise. There are also level ups (you can unlock weapons, perks etc), some kind of perks (you can choose between ammo bag or health bag or you can choose between having more ammo or being stronger for example). This class thing is also important, since you really need to work together and have a good plan. The game is quite challenging, so coop teamwork is essential. Because you have to work together its very fun and tactical, especially if you play with friends. The best thing is, that it only costs 20 bucks. The only contract thing I have is, that the upgrade stuff isn't explain very good (you have to press tab while in the game, and choose the class you want to upgrade in the next level up). The graphics aren't exactly crisis, but they look good (in my opinion). Finally I can only say, if you are tired of all these military FPS or just want to experience something unique in FPS or love movies like heat or the town or just want to play a great game, then go and buy payday.",

Its so unique that it has gained a huge following, a sequel that takes the game to a whole new level, and awesome characters. The series even has its own festival, Crimefest. Can that explain the game?  I first started playing the game on a laptop back in 2012, when it was free on the weekend. And when I bought it, I didnt remember how much I played, so I was surprised that I was rank 25. I got that high in two days. Talk about fun, that is what games are supposed to be. But so many new games are so repetitive, this one is also that sometimes, and doesnt come with anything new. But Payday sure does. Crime has never been so fun.",

            "review_text": "Title:  'Payday: The Heist'  Developer(s)/publisher(s):  Overkill Software/Sony Online Entertainment  Genre(s):  First-person shooter, Co-op  Mode(s):  Single-player, Co-op  General info:  Payday: The Heist is a 2011 downloadable cooperative first-person shooter video game, that runs on a modified Diesel game engine. It contains seven different missions (including the free 'No Mercy' downloadable content, released on 25 July 2012), with each mission containing random elements which alter the gameplay in subtle ways with the aim of enhancing replayability. On August 7, 2012, the 'Wolf Pack' DLC was released on PS3 and PC. This DLC added two new heists, additional weapons, and a new player upgrade tree.   Gameplay:  In each heist, players are required to complete objectives, usually in an effort to steal cash or valuables. The police will attempt to stop them, but players are expected to fight through them with firearms, except in the case of the mission called 'Diamond Heist', where players can slip past guards unnoticed and acquire diamonds to complete the mission.  The game plays from the first person perspective, but offers a few twists on the standard FPS formula.  Killing civilians is punished, instead players may take a limited number as hostages by intimidating and binding their hands. Should any player get arrested (after taking enough damage and not being 'revived' in time) during the heist, one of the other teammates may release a hostage, allowing a trade to take place which allows this player to be released.  While playing the levels, players will notice a lot of variation in a single level, as there are often a large number of random events programmed in. An example of this is the location of the bank manager in the mission 'First World Bank'. The game features an automated leveling-system, with four different classes/skill trees.  Experience points are earned through completing objectives and lead to leveling up, which in turn lets the player aqquire 1 out of four different skills each level. These skills improve hit accuracy, armor, crowd control or unlocks new weapons and equipment.  The maximum level - which was raised with the DLC Wolf Pack - is 145.  There are five different difficulty options in the game; Easy, Normal, Hard, Overkill and Overkill 145+ (which can only be attempted after reaching the 145:th level).   Story:  Although Payday: The Heist does not focus on any significant single-player plot, the characters and missions do have some backstory.  The game focuses on a four man team of bankrobbers - code-named 'Dallas', 'Hoxton', 'Chains', and 'Wolf' - who team up due to their different skills. They all dress up in suits (or ballistic armor depending on their mission) and don Clown-like masks to hide their appearance.  What they all have in common are troubled lives, monetary debts and bad memories. As the 'Payday-crew', they join up for a criminal spree, looking to be 'set for life'.  Chronologically, the team's first heist took place at the First World Bank, where they entered a vault by using thermite hidden inside the bank by an insideman and stole a large amount of money before blasting a hole through a wall and escaping through the neighbouring building.  Working for a mysterious criminal hacker codenamed 'Bane', whom they receive orders and directions from, they are given different kinds of missions. These missions are generally centered on robbery, kidnapping, and occassionally assassination.   My opinions:  I first discovered this game in March 2012, about half a year after it's release here on Steam. I heard about it from a friend, who had bought it earlier and he recommended it to me (Thx a lot for that, Max!).  I bought it a while later and we started playing together (although my friend soon got way ahead of me level-wise).  Payday: The Heist may have been developed by a studio that was quite small at the time of it's release, but that only makes it even more impressing.  I really enjoy this game, although I play it's sequel ('Payday 2') a lot more these days.  Still, in my opinion Payday: The Heist offers harder challenges than it's sequel in terms of missions and the game's achievements are worth the time it may take to accomplish them!  It's a definitive must buy, although the standard price of 14,99 euro might be a little high - waiting for a sale is the best option.  I recommend this game to all people who love FPS co-op or simply want to don a Clown-mask and rob some banks.   Buy this game, and remember; 'Keep those helmets flying!'",

The game as itself, is a 4 player co-op or single player, where you play as criminals who rob banks, escort convicts, do drug deals, to a big planned heist hard to pull off.

Also extra perks, and things like ammo bags, doctor bags, and trip mines. There is online gameplay where you connect from people close, far, or worldwide from you.

You can't really have a unique loadout of guns because you will have to level up alot 4. Without great teamwork, you can't really win except maybe on the first mission, the bank mission  Final Verdict: 7/10 ***really unqiue game, but is really hard to have custimization with not alot of guns or special abilities.***  Still a great co-op game though.

Luckily you have some guns to shoot back with, but you can also deploy a bag which contains ammo or health - very hand when you're in a tight situation. Also, if one of your team gets captured by the police then you can take a hostage and exchange them instead of waiting for their respawn timer. Payday also uses leveling so as you play more you earn money which means better accuracy, more ammo, new weapons, etc.  Payday is not as polished as L4D2, and has no versus, but don't let that put you off - this game is a load of fun if you have three friends.

The engine isn't being used by anyone else these days. The models, while nice, could use some work to be prettier. Sometimes enemies can glitch around and pop through collision walls.

A lot of the replayability comes from the unlock system, constantly improving your loadouts through three skill trees. The gunplay is good enough that it doesn't get too stale too quickly, and ammo is scarce enough relative to enemies that the missions usually feel tense and exciting. The game isn't without frustrations - gameplay feels almost unreasonably hard before the unlocks get going, and stealth isn't really an option, even in missions that suggest it.  Overall recommendation: if you've got some buddies to play it with, and don't mind a bit of repetition, there's some good times to be had in this one. Pick it up on sale.",

The community is safe for new players which is nice. You can't take advantage of all the features when playing with AI but the AI is intelligent enough to make single player mode playable.  Lots to unlock, and items/targets vary in location with each play so there is some replayability. The menu and leveling system could be a bit more intuitive but it's not horrible.

Pros:    Interesting heists, mixed up with a lack of objectives and scenery   Decent levelling-up system which clearly was inspiration for the second game   More realistic and - in my opinion - more difficult than the second game   Long, difficult standoffs often lasting upwards of 30 minutes    Cons:    Missing the wide diversity of weapons, tools and characters in PAYDAY 2   Sound and visual could be described as 'meh' at best, even for 2011 (remember that this was the year Battlefield 3 came out)   Stealth in this game is almost non-existant in every heist except for Diamond Heist   Controls and gunplay are a little finicy at times   Guns are mostly boring to use, compared to the roaring weapons of PAYDAY 2   All in all, PAYDAY: The Heist is the game which gave PAYDAY 2 all of it's interesting ideas and success. It's interesting to see where Overkill started with the series, but in comparison PAYDAY 2 is still better.   My rating: 8/10 ",

The enemies in this game carry GUNS which completely changes the way you need to think about handling the situation. The game requires some level of pre-planing before each heist to be successful, a team running around with 4 medi-bags is going to find themselves hurting for ammo very soon. The few issues I have with this game is that there are only 6 heist and many of them involve defending a point for a set amount of time. Also with the inclusion of a Rep system newer players may find themselves getting kicked from many lobbies.",

            "review_text": "PAYDAY: The Heist is a great game, but the thing is that it gets repetitive really quickly. PAYDAY 2 also suffers the same fate. PAYDAY: The Heist is a great game to play with friends and a bit mediocre when playing with random people on the internet.  PAYDAY: The Heist is about four heisters, all with unique stories which is great, that get involved in various heists such as a bank heist, diamond heist, drug house bust and taking money from a counterfeit money creator. Dallas is the main heister as he is the leader. Dallas is American, Hoxton is British, Wolf is Swedish and Chains is African-American.  PAYDAY: The Heist's guns don't feel very good for me as the animation makes it seem that the guns are simple toy guns and have no recoil. It just doesn't feel good when you get a kill or even just shoot it normally. Combat is also pretty much Left 4 Dead with cops, as many people have already stated. PAYDAY 2 improved on that as it added stealth and less extreme waves of police enforcers.  One of the best things about PAYDAY: The Heist is it's heists. They are all very unique, have fun and unique objectives (Except for waiting for drills) and all make you feel accomplished when you successfully finish it.  I am not saying that PAYDAY: The Heist is necessarily a bad game, but it can get repetitive very quickly, even if you are playing with friends. If you buy this game, do not expect to be playing it for very long. At least you can enjoy the amount of time where you are not bored with your friends.  3/5.",

Nix getting killed outside the bank vault over and over again, exchanging my first hostage for a teammate, Ben Dickens and I massacring a SWAT team while monitoring the second floor of a drug den -- this game turned the IGN office into a screaming match. PayDay: The Heist is stiff and unintuitive in spots, but the overall package is a fun and a welcome addition to the PlayStation Network.   PayDay: The Heist Video Review If you've seen Point Break or played Left 4 Dead, wrapping your head around PayDay: The Heist is easy. A cooperative first-person shooter, PayDay casts you and three bots or online friends as thieves and gives you six different jobs to go out on. Missions range from a bank heist to breaking out a prisoner to getting away from a job gone wrong, and enemy tactics change depending on how you're tackling a job.  When I first started playing, I assumed these situations would get stale as the mission objectives don't change -- you're always doing the same action in the same place -- but PayDay keeps it interesting with its dynamic leveling system. Your character evolves as you play and that tweaks the game's various heists. Each time you level up, you unlock a new weapon, item or bonus from the experience tree you have active. See, there are three trees and you can switch between them at any time. This is important to point out in the review because PayDay never explains this system in the game. I had to call the folks behind PayDay to get an explanation of how the trees work. PayDay's menus tend to just throw text at you and leave you to figure it out. I'm sure most people will do just that, but I know some folks will just walk away in frustration.  That's a shame because the skill trees are worth getting to the bottom of -- there are more than 140 levels to achieve. Once you get an established crew together, you can build teams where everyone has a specialized function. You can have a medic, an ammo man, a dude whose sole job is to handcuff hostages; it all depends on which tree a given player has been investing in. That kind of role-playing is great for people who want to nerd out and plan missions.  Playing heists over and over again is the point of PayDay. Each time I started a job, I was out to do better than the time before. I'd warn new teammates about faulty drills, coordinate taking out security cameras, and call out cops that needed to be wiped out. It was actually a bit creepy (yet thrilling) how well my friends and I transitioned into the role of criminals. We'd pull our guns, put on our clown masks, and begin working as a unit. Cue the in-office screaming and me loving the atmosphere.   Get off my roof.  But make no mistake about it, the 'we' was a big part of the good time. PayDay: The Heist packs a single-player option that pairs you with AI teammates, but it's only good for getting to know the maps and working on leveling up. The game shines when you play it with friends using headsets, and even then, dumb enemies and stiff gunplay can spoil some people's good time.  PayDay really stumbles when it comes to presentation and polish. Objectives populate every map and change as the job progresses (go here, bomb this, capture that). However, the game doesn't bother explaining them all that well. There's a part in the first mission where you have to wait for a fire to eat through a bank vault's ceiling, and every time someone new played with me, they'd think we missed something or screwed something up as the fire just burns and burns and burns. There's no countdown, and the majority of the references to the process are in-game audio lines that get lost when players are jabbering at each other.  The game just feels clunky at times whether it's an enemy spawning from thin air or someone clipping through a wall.  THE VERDICT If you're looking for fun co-op multiplayer on the cheap, PayDay: The Heist fits the bill at $20. I enjoyed my time with it and want to play more with my friends. Working together to get the loot and the insanity of trying to get out alive are tense, enjoyable experiences. Issues like the clipping and generally 'blah' presentation keep PayDay from being an amazing experience, but they don't stop it from being a good time.",

Even the AI is better. So, robbing banks is your thing. Great, because heists are AWESOME. With friends. Really, if you're a kind of solo player, like me, then this isn't the game for you. The AI is so frustrating in how it can't do 'player-only' things. In the sequel, it's worse. In case you're wondering, the sequel is really bad. But this game is fantastic, being so intense. Unfortunately, there's not much stealth. I played most of the heists, and stopped because it got so tiring with only one of me, and there was only one where you could stealth a section of it. That was the start, and you could even mess that up. So, as a solo player, I think you should avoid this, but with 2-4 people, these things are super fun, since the objectives also go twice as fast with two players. I recommend, even though I didn't experience online, since with friends, this becomes fun.",

PayDay 1 puts you in a crime group tha goes around and pulls off heists while trying not to get killed/arrested by the police.  You can play as either Chains, Hoxton, Wolf or Dallas. Each Character has a unique personality to them so they dont get boring after playing for a while.  The Game offers 6 different heists in the base game while the DLC adds another 2-3 heists. You can rob a bank, pull off a diamond heist, etc.   Reputation levels is the XP system in the game, you gain Reputation by completing objectives during heists, picking up small money bundles in the heists, completing challenges and finishing heists. Each time you level your Rep you gain upgrades to weapons, upgrades to your characters health, and a variety of other rewards that can be used to benefit you in the heist.  The guns are very well balanced and different from each other so no weapon is better than the other. however the number of guns in the game are a tad low its not something that bothers me because each weapon is good at something. You a good sharpshooter? Grab the M308 and pick off Police Snipers at longe ranges. You like to run and gun? Grab either the AMCAR Assault rifle or the Reinback Shotgun and annahilate the police forces. You more of a support player? Grab the Brenner LMG and cover your teammates as they complete objectives. Or maybe you want to blow things up? Get the Wolf Pack DLC and you can get the GL40 Grenade Launcher which is perfect for clearing civilain free rooms filled with cops.    Different Types of Police Units:    - Guards : these are your basic enemies. they are only armed with pistols and easy to take down. - Police Officers : Another basic enemy but this time they can be armed with not only pistols but also shotguns making them deadly at close ranges. - FBI Agents : Another basic Enemy that is only armed with Pistols but has light body armour. - S.W.A.T : SWAT Officers are a little tougher because they have light armour and can carry SMGs which makes them an annoyance at medium range combat. - Heavy S.W.A.T : These guys are tough. They have heavy armour and can carry either Shotguns, SMGs or Assault Rifles. - Police Snipers : These guys hide on rooftops and other high places to try and pick your team off from long ranges. These guys hit hard so be careful when these guys show up.    Special Police Units   - Shields : These guys are Heavy SWAT officers that carry a bullet proof shield into combat that will make it tough for you to kill not only them but the other police units. You can tell when a Shield is near because he bangs on his shield a couple times - Tasers : Taser Officers can be a really pain the butt. These guys will tase you till you are incapped or until a teammate shoots them or you shoot the taser. You can tell when a Taser is in the area by hearing him charge up his taser and by the Yellow Shoulder Plates on the officers Armour. - Cloakers : Cloakers are a huge threat to heists because of their speed and instant incap if you let them get to close. The only way to tell if a cloaker is near is by his Green light on his Nightvision goggles other than that they are silent strikers. Be on your toes. - The Bulldozer : The Bulldozer is an officer in really heavy body armour and a bullet resistant helmet. These guys are armed with Shotguns and arent afraid to waltz right in on your team and ruin the WHOLE heist in a matter of seconds.  Overrall this game is an amazing game. The Gameplay is very good and doesnt get boring after a while. The variety of guns and enemies make the heists a challenge at several points. Playing with Friends makes the game 100 times more fun. I Highly Suggest you buy this game over Payday 2.   I give this game a 9.5 out of 10",

In my mind, GOTY 2011. Worth every cent. Also pick up Wolfpack and The soundtrack! All of them good investments!",

Preferably get this on a sale but it is good yet little game with people still playing, 8.5/10.",

Payday 2 was so much better than Payday: The Heist when it first came out, but after the first DLC on Payday 2 it all started going downhill.
