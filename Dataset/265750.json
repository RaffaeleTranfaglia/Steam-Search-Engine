I have tons on fun with it, and I can see many others sharing the same feeling. However, its small playerbase has kept it from becoming something amazing. Now would be the best time to play, as the more people play, the more the devs will add to the game. Great game to play with friends. Hell, hit me up if you need someone to play with.",

The game is in a catch 22 situation, because people aren't playing because of the low player base, but the reason there's a low player base is because people aren't playing. It's a cicle that will continue unless it's interupted, it isn't going to sort itself.   Don't buy, because I heavily doubt that a couple more players will save this game's population.

Aside from my personal issues with framerate and overall pacing, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and am now getting romped in Ranked. I would very much like to play this with a friend or two and develop strategies to execute in game.  Overall, the better the community for this game, the better it will become.

Very rewarding for skilled players Cons -Hard to get a vote for the play modes i want -I love the graphics but my rig can run with with two eyes closed, i wish there was an ultra graphics option. -Limited soundtrack  This game is going to take off and for the 50% off weekend you cant lose!

You have different characters to choose and fighting goes far beyond 'right click aim left click shoot': Each has a 'move' list like you'd see in a fighting game like Tekken or something that allows you to do all sorts of neat crap on top of pumping other gangsters full of lead. It's a game that just takes raw skill, but there's no reason to be intimidated: It's an easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master sort of game. Note that the different characters also have 'Difficulty' ratings and there are plenty that are welcoming to new players (And seriously, none of them are overpowered. More often than not low difficulty characters tend to be irritatingly common to find and hard to beat, but that's not the case here) and man this game is just fun. I highly reccommend it on sale and it's definitely worth it at full price.",

As an Early Access, this would get a solid 9/10 from me, but as a game that's being presented as a final product, I can't give it such a high score.   Some game mechanics are unbalanced and bugged (like The Killer's knife, which can fly over a cover and hit a target hiding behind that cover, or Phantom's whip, that can be seen by opponent even without clear visual on covering Phantom, therefore rendering any cover for sneaking totally useless with whip equipped), there are typos and misspelling in achievements and moveset descriptions, hitboxes sometimes behave way too odd, and connecting to a match (even if we don't count the matchmaking system, which is sometimes quite unballanced) is a pain in about one fifth of all 1v1 cases - if the opponent doesn't load the match, you get stuck on the match loading screen (which is just a blank screen with crow wallpaper - no indication if you are still loading or waiting for an opponent). The only way out is to force quit the game, which then causes a -300 $ Bounty drop every time.  This game certainly got my attention and I will definitely consider purchasing it in the future, if the issues will get solved. The atmosphere of spaghetti westerns, the music, the design and both single and multiplayer gameplay (if we ignore all the negative stuff I wrote above) are quite good and original. However at this state, I'm not going to spend my money on a product that needs fixing.",

This does make the character unique but it really takes away the balance in the 1v1 scenario, I can see how she can get destroyed in 2v2 and 3v3.

And to be honest? This game is great. Really great actually. The gameplay itself is a top down shooter but in a MOBA themed arena - 2vs2. You choose a character, add a few stats and that is it - you are good to go! Well..no, unfortunately. Why? Because no one seems to be playing the game. Seriously! I was waiting for a few minutes in a lobby, until 2 more people joined. The last and 4th person didn't join after a while, so I left and tried again a few minutes later, after I played a round with the AI. What happened? The same two people.

            "review_text": "A consoel port. Absolutely not recommended for PC gamers with even light quality standards.  The control scheme is utterly unintuitive, because the devs decided not to bother to create a proper PC control scheme and instead simply rebound the functions to the keyboard and mouse keys.  Animations constantly seize up, causing terrible visuals such as your character sliding around along the ground with legs paralyzed in a static position while reloading.  Actions don't have a fluidity/queue system implemented, meaning that chaining different actions together is unnecessarily rough, and this was in single player -- I can only imagine how bad it would be in multiplayer with even moderate latency.  And overall production quality is nothing to brag about either.  Yes, this is an indie game, but there is never, ever an excuse for not implementing a proper PC control scheme.  Cheap console ports are always unacceptable, regardless of any circumstances.  Couple that with lazy production efforts, and you get a mediocre game that controls awkwardly and lacks the depth to keep people playing even if everything else were polished.",

First of all they advertise this game as a game of skill , where every shot counts. well that is false,  All the game ends up is either both teams charging at each other every match , or one team that just runs the entire match , but mostly it is just run towards each other and and smother , and it never changes , gets old real quick , its like counter strike , but not near as good , and counter strike is not good. Just two teams running at each other, And far as the skills go , well you have around 3 of those and get old real quick. And as far as a persons 'skill' affecting the game? Not really , pretty much charge and button mash will do , thats what pretty much everyone does.  Another thing i found that i did not like is , after just a couple hours of play your toon has to move to ranked play. You dont even have time to get a feel for your toon and your playing ranked, its just silly , Overall , the graphics i did like , something different and kinda cool. But game play is a big fat thumbs down , skill to play , very little , time before realize it is not worth what you paid , not quick enough to get money back unfortantly , but wont take a day. 12 hours tops. Keep in mind , you get what you pay for , least that applies to this game.",

A large part of this game is about teaming up with other online players and kicking ♥♥♥♥ out of them. The main issue is that the menu/navigation screen/online group selection etc is so badly made. I have been playing this game on and off. Usually I play for about 15 minutes with my friends until we give up trying to connect or we have been thrown out of the group because of an unknown reason. Matchmaking with friends put you with randoms and not friends. This free week is supposed to boost the game yet it still doesn't work? I guess the devs are just after the money if they don't change it... Pity. This has the potential to be VERY good.  These are bugs that NEED! to be fixed. The developers are killing their own game off if they do not resolve this issue.  Other than this the game is amazing and I have recommended this to multiple people however all of us want to get a spade and hit the developers on the head for making this teaser.

            "review_text": "Secret Ponchos is an amazingly fresh and beautiful take on the twitch fighting genre. The developers have put together a very tight package where the artwork, style, learning curve, controls, music, environments, etc. are all extremely well considered, put together and complimentary. The minute you open the game, you notice the artwork and the design, and then as you play, you are happy to notice that the mechanics and gameplay hold pace and do not disappoint.   It's hard to classify this game in comparison to other games because it's not like much else I've ever played, but if I had to pull from other games I would say that it shares: - Twitch style controlling of a Street Fighter game (unless you're a button masher). It's not a point and unload your clip kind of game. Every shot is a skilled considered button push and can combo out with your other 'moves' and every movement of your character is a considered move in relation to the positioning of your opponents and the map. - MOBA style arena. Not in that you have a set spawn point and half the map is kind of yours, but pretty much only in the way that you have an isometric viewpoint and there is a large arena where two teams battle (unless you're in free-for-all mode).   Throw those elements into a fast paced beautiful spaghetti western environment and you've got yourself Secret Ponchos.   As for the game play: There are 10 characters to choose from and they all cater to different play styles and learning curves. Unlike street fighter, there is not a dozen or more moves to master. Each character has about 4-5 unique moves that can also potentially combo for devastating effects. But these moves are very nuanced in their execution and very reactive to the conditions around you. You never feel at a lack of moves/attacks to use when playing a specific character.   Some characters you can jump right into and expect a couple kills per match, others you will need to master. All characters though - as I have experienced first hand - can be very deadly in professional hands. And this is the good thing: every character, and the game itself, have a high ceiling in terms of skill. Even the characters that are easy to immediately play with have a lot of subtle nuance that takes a long time to perfect. And how you play according to your environment and your opponents/teammates takes a long time to even begin to master.  This does create a skill deferential between the pros and the newcomers, but a rookie lobby, a supportive community, and an intelligent progression system (explained below) all help the fact that a relative rookie still has a decent chance at gunning down a pro a couple times per match (and it's not like a pro/rookie skill differential has prevented people from playing other games such as COD).  The manner in which your character progresses is one of my favourite aspects of this game. As opposed to an empty and overused 'Experience Points = Level Up' sort of structure, the developers have gone with something that suits the genre and the vibe of a Wild West setting. Instead of collecting experience, you collect notoriety. And much like the real world, notoriety can come and go; you play very well and you gain notoriety, but if you play poorly, you will lose notoriety. For me this is a welcome change, and something I have been secretly desiring out of more games of late. No more players who don't cooperate with their team because they want to get the 'throw back grenade achievement' (I'm looking at you COD Black Ops).   Everyone feels like their neck is on the line and it makes the game play riveting and exhilarating. The important thing here too is that it's well balanced. A loss will never strip away so much notoriety that you will feel devastated and ready to quit the game. And for rookies starting out, each match calculates your odds of doing well, and the notoriety you gain/lose is in relation to those odds. So if you play a group of pros, you can still gain notoriety if you lost but still successfully dealt some damage or made some kills. TO NOTE: this progression is specific to each of your characters, so if you want to try out a new character or a new play style, you can do so without influencing the notoriety of your star player.   As you do gain notoriety, you get to drop a couple points into various skills (damage, reload, health, speed, etc). These points don't come often though and are well balanced so that the differences it creates between a rookie character and a pro character is noticeable but not so distancing that there is no competition between the two.   Everything in this game (the setting, progression system, matches, etc.) leads to a very strong and cohesive immersive, addictive, fast paced game where you can really feel your character gaining notoriety, and feel your skills improve. On top of that it's fun!  I would strongly recommend trying this title out as it's a wonderfully styled and scored adrenalin rush to play! And to top it off, there is a strong dev team that play the game and consider and respond daily to issues, ideas and concerns that the community has. Their supportive and friendly attitude seems to trickle down into the community, forming a supportive and friendly player base.   And to those curious about the community of this pvp-only game: since launch it has been growing steadily and I have found no dead times where I couldn't find a match. I only see it getting better and I am looking forward to a growing strong and friendly player base!",

I would no doubt recommend this game to anyone, it has alot of depth, the matches are intense and the skill ceiling on this game is high as balls. I heard about the competitive side of Secret Ponchos had an astonishing potential and I kinda doubted it. Well it has. If you like the amazing aesthetic this has to offer, old wild west appeals to you you should get this game for some Outlaw intense experience matches.  Now I wish everything in this review was positive, I really really did because the game blew me away in surprise and sucked me in. But there is a big negative here and it is the community. People here are the friendliest I've ever seen in any game in years, but it is really really small.. If you are a late night time player, the sad truth at the moment is that you might not get any matches at all.. It takes sometimes a really long time to find a match, fortunatly because of this people tend to stick with each other after the match, so in my experience when you find one you are pretty much set and the next matches will be quick if not instant since the game gives you a rematch option.  It boggles my mind how the player base is so small for this amazing game, it really really REALLY deserves so much more. I could honestly see this game with a strong viewership on twitch for example it has that potential. I'd say this happened because of the poor advertising and proprer word spreading of the game. From my understanding this game has been in early acess for at least an year I think? And I've never heard of it. Ever. I can't see any place other than a very very small percentage of youtubers that make a few videos here and there to Secret Ponchos where I would find this game.  Now I've been going to forums and the developers are aware and are going to implement features, possibly changing the 'rules' for a bigger player base so there is hope since the developers are actually pretty active with the community it seems.  So honestly, I wish I could be a ♥♥♥♥ and not say this negative side just so more people would buy and the playerbase to grow, but I can't be that ♥♥♥♥. Would and do I still recommend it? YES. When you get a match is amazing, and since the game is NOT abandoned by any means witha ctive developers announcing they are going to further look and fix this issue I would say it is still a relative safe bet. Because honestly I know the developers know they made an amazing game. I know it is an amazing game and the fault I would put in very poor advertising. This game is a hidden gem, you just don't hear it anywhere. If you like it get it, contribute to the playerbase, and rest assured the developers are here and not abandoning ship!
