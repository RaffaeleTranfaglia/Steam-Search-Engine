            "review_text": "I've played this game before on Xbox Live, simply bought it out of respect I have for it.  This is probably THE best Indie game I played on Xbox Live (though their tags for that are shoveling all the 'indie' into the crap little-no effort aisle). Otherwise I quite like this game, though I dislike they apparently made updated Melee to be weaker at some point, which seems unnecessary (especially since HP for Zombies weren't compensated it looks like).  Thank you for those who found this 'helpful' vague, unhelpful as it is, but I'm glad some people found it funny! It's a simple game that does its job well, and the desired experience of a zombie apolcaypse seems to be fully represented in all its mechanics.  Anyway, its worth the $3.   EDIT to the Steam Committee who wants to know this:  It Fulfills the 'Test of Time', as its simple nature allows for replayability, with it always a challenge on 'Hardest', Achievements for some that tempt you to do things a little differently in a given run, as well as it's a decent casual game to play with a friend for Couch-Co-Op. So long as it exists, it won't really stop being fun, and can always go back to play again.",

            "review_text": "Dead Pixels is a 'Grindhouse' side-scrolling zombie shooter with some survival elements planted in it, as well as RNG. Dead pixels is your typical zombie survival shooter, but does it VERY well for the price.  DP has you running from one end of the street to the other, killing zombies, looting some houses for items/weapons/ammo, trading with merchants, and trying not to die. The number of streets you must traverse all depends on what difficulty you choose or what gamemode. You have 3 different gamemodes. You have a 'Story' mode that consists of you getting to the end to escape the city and win, a survival mode, and a time attack mode. All will pit you against the hoards of zombies which vary from the common slow moving zombs, to acid spitting, to commando zombs, to mutant zombs, and the rare chance of 'Boss' zombies.  Don't fret though, as you also get a large arsenal to help you. The most common weapons you will find are shotguns, rifles, and pistols. The farther you get in the game (and the harder difficulties,) you will find more powerful weaponry, such as flamethrowers, mini guns, plasma rifles, freeze rays, and even chainsaws. You will also get an assortment of throwing items, like frag grenades, pipe bombs, molotovs, flairs, TNT, and much more. Don't forget about the med kits!  Aside from the items, you can also upgrade your character with the money the zombies drop. You can upgrade your max health, run speed, gun skills, melee skills, carrying capacity, bargaining skill, and luck. This adds in the slight RPG aspect to the game which is nice. In the 'Original' story mode your character starts with nothing for stats, but in 'The Solution' story, it has all pre-set characters that have different stats and different starting gear.  This game presents it's self like an old retro 'Grindhouse' movie game, and using old pixel style graphics to give it the old school look. All the graphics look great and all feel like they belong in the game, and fit in very well. Each type of zombie all have their own look, the backgrounds look good, and the blood all looks good.  There is a few glaring issues though with this game. The biggest one being it has Coop, but it's local coop only. As someone that doesn't have friends, I didn't have anyone to try and complete the game in coop with. I tried to do it myself, but I wasn't very coordinated to do it. The other big problem is Melee. I found once you maxed out the melee skill, you can cake walk the entire game without having to shoot one bullet. I beat the hardest difficulty with no effort because of this.   Pros: - Lots of content for the price. - Easy to pick up and play. - Simple Pixel art. - Good music/sounds. - Not much story, but doesn't really need it. - Lots of items/weapons to pick up. - Lots of different zombies and bosses. - Cheap price. - Achievements.  Cons: - Can be very repetitive. - Some may not like the old pixel style graphics. - All menus are text based and don't have any graphics/images with them. - Music may get repetitive. - Melee is stupid OP. - Local Coop only. - No Steam Cards.  For a $3 game it's a hell of a deal! Lots of bang for you $. If you are just looking for a fun Indi game look no further! I will always recommend this game to everyone.",

It's not bad for a side scrolling, 8-bit, Zombie killing game.  The mouse cursor doesn't aim your gun, just points your character in which way he should face. Everything seems overly expensive, even on easy. There isn't enough ammo even if you spend all your money on it. So you end up just running past everything. I got half way through the game on easy, just running past everything when it decided to crash.  If you stand and fight you will quickly find ourself low on ammo. THe game could easily run two players LAN or Internet, but refuses to do so. Local Co-op only. Which is better then nothing. It might be fun to grab a friend and hook up a controler for him, keyboard for you, and see how far you can get.   If you can pick this game up on sale, it will give you an hour or two of fun. But I'd avoid this game otherwise.",

            "review_text": "Get ready gang its time for another zombie apocalypse and this time, Dead Pixels brings guns and strategy to a belt scrolling beat em up that has you alone or with a friend for some local cooperative action. You walk through through the streets, gunning down randomized waves of zombies and using currency they drop to purchase weapons, upgrades and ammunition. The ammunition is life, because each street crescendos with thicker waves of zombies so they can overwhelm you.  On the surface, Dead Pixels looks like a blend between a pixelated throw back to the late 80s and a grind house cinema with its intentional film grain. It even starts like an old movie complete with the countdown of 4, 3, 2, 1 and now for our feature presentation. Both of which alienate it from its 8-bit style. In the game it looks like a cross between old school retro themed charm and cheap with its red lines painted on walls.  The objective is to make your way through dozens of streets to the end in three campaigns. There are unimpressive boss fights here and there. They tend to feel like standard enemies that look special. The issue with the bosses is that they take damage and draw in other zombies to attack you. Every so often you get a change of scenery, but its a long wait before you see something different.  Your character moves a tad bit faster than zombies and you can still dodge them in even great numbers, but the screen can fill with the green undead. Even after you've cleared an area, if you backtrack, there will always be more zombies waiting for you so you need to pick a direction and stick with it.  Shooting zombies in the face looks good, but its a step down from the diversity of beating people up with punches, kicks and fancy moves. That's why this game fits in more with strategy than a cold beat'em up. The brawler genre wears thin on me after a short while and that's why so many of them are short. Dead Pixels with its three campaigns is a good long game.  Even with guns, its a tough game, but any game that requires you to grind for more cash in order to upgrade will always be an uphill battle. You need to use strategy to determine if a zombie is worth the ammunition spent killing it. Weapons have penetration, damage, firing speed and range. They come in three types: rifles, shotguns and short range that fire quick, but do small damage.  The controls are set up beautiful and it recommends to use a controller. Left trigger and bumper to shoot or throw a projectile to the left and the right trigger and bumper to do the same thing to the right. This allows you to run left while shooting right. The left stick controls, the directional pad switches between weapons, items and throwables. Otherwise, you can hop in the menu to select something.  As you go through the game, you'll encounter a lot of doors, most of which have been spray painted over to mark that there's nothing inside. Other doors you can enter to collect random loot. Searching these areas is like looting a treasure chest. With everything that you collect, it increases your weight and in some rare cases, you can become over encumbered and move slower. To counteract this, you need to go into the menu and start dropping things and its always guns that have the most weight. Once something is dropped, its gone for good. Its always good to have only the best weapon for each type of bullet. Otherwise you can quick change to something weak and suffer wasted ammunition.  For everything extra that you have, there are shops about one per street that you can sell to. These shops have a lot of depth. They offer things for you to buy, sell you upgrades, save your game and they even want specific things that they're willing to pay big money for. If you have something they want, sell it to them. If you find it later, it will only cost more ammunition to go back and sell it to them.  So why is ammunition so valuable? You can find it in rooms, but other than that, you need to buy it and the problem is that once you buy it, then its gone. You need to keep pushing forward to find more ammunition and stores that sell it. That's why its best to have a weapon for each of the three types of ammunition. Sure you can melee enemies, but you can die trying too. Its best to keep zombies as far away as possible.  If you have big money, buy upgrades. They come in the form of more maximum health, more weapon damage, more melee damage, more luck, more speed, better bargaining at shops and more strength to carry more. I recommend better bargaining over everything else. Then more weapons to keep enemies at bay. After you've upgraded yourself into a supreme being, you can take out eight zombies with a single shotgun blast and become all powerful, yet still succumb to a lack of ammunition.  The game offers a diverse array of zombies with different characteristics. Standard zombies will get alert and give quicker pace. Elderly zombies that are slower. Smaller zombies that spot you from far away and charge at you. These are the ones that you'll need to shoot rather than dodge. Spitters launch a stream of green glowing goo. Soldiers can take a lot of damage and so on. They're all divvied out slow so you need to wade through a lot of streets before the game starts to ramp up the diversity.  In terms of cash and fun, you can get a kill combo going. The problem is you still need to collect the cash... before it disappears. So taking down a flood of enemies becomes meaningless if you never charge in risking your health for the coin. If you're at the top or bottom of the screen zombies can pin you, and they wait for others to hurt you. There's no way to shoot them, because you can only shoot left and right rather than north or south.  There are plenty of med kits to restore your health. Some zombies drop antidotes to poison. Adrenaline makes you go faster. You'll get grenades and incendiaries to light a pack of zombies on fire. Fire crackers can be thrown to distract the enemies if you ever need to, but its just easier to walk around the undead.  Dying kicks you back to the main menu where you can either load a save for an auto save of the street you were on. It would have streamlined things just to have you chose rather than kicking you back to a menu. With a game that can box you in, its good to have a save in addition to your auto save. Since enemies are randomized there's always still a chance you'll make it through no matter how the odds are stacked.  Dead Pixels is well worth its dirt cheap price, even if you take a risk on a game that's a grind. There's a lot here, but its slow progress.",

It has really good controller and local co-op support that was a ton of fun for my friend and I to play (Him on a PS3 controller and me on a 360 controller). Dead Pixels has a good amount of content with a story and survival mode, that is fairly challenging and is surprisingly addictive. For a $1.01 it is surprisingly polished and has a pretty hilarious storyline. There is a large variety of zombies that all have different amounts of health and abilities. Also throughout the game you'll find many buildings to loot and traders to buy weapons and ammo, and sell valuables.  There are simple RPG elements throughout the game that allow you to upgrade your player with enhancments such as; Run Speed, Weapon Damage, Health, Melee and Strength. These upgrades all cost a pretty penny though, and I guarentee you'll be running low on money the first couple hours you play, just because of the mass amount of junk there is to buy. I find myself overencumbered all the time just because I feel like I'll use some items eventually, even though I usually don't.  The wide variety of weapons is also a really interesting mechanic especially since there limit to how much you can carry, also there isn't one dominate weapon for there is a down side to every weapons strengths. For example, the Chainsaw can shred zombies up but you need to get close and there is a limited amount of gasoline you can carry. The Burton assault rifle has really good range and damage, but blows through ammo ridiculously fast.   In the end Dead Pixels deserves a 9/10, It's a solid Indie game with no real downside except for the lack of online Co-Op. There is also no way to change options unless you quit to the launcher which got pretty annoying while setting up a keyboard and mouse, which most people won't have to do.",

The gameplay itself is fun even though it tends to get repetitive about halfway through each of the story modes. This is not due to a lack of weapons and items.

There are some slight RPG elements too like upgradable stats, weapons, and items to distract/destroy the zombies.

Don't bother playing on anything above easy or normal though because the difficulty curve is not a curve but a brick wall upon selecting anything above normal. On hard it's impossible to upgrade your weapons because you won't have any money and you won't have any money because you spent it all buying ammo and you spent it all buying ammo because it takes upwards of 5 shots to kill even the starting enemies and it takes upwards of 5 shots to kill even the starting enemies because it's impossible upgrade your weapons. Notice the circle there. Not to mention that if you try to loot too much stuff to sell later you will get weighted down and can't move fast and mobility is a crucial part of strategy in this game.  For all it's faults though, there is some joy to be had here. So, get a buddy to play with and keep the game on easy and the two of you can blast the day away in massive spurts of pixilated blood.

It's rather different. It blends certain RPG elements with a myriad of weapons and a beat-em-up map layout.  The object of the game is to cross several streets littered with the walking dead in order to reach the survivors after a zombie epidemic plagues the city. Along the way you can loot buildings, trade supplies and save at shops, and, of course, kill the undead. The enemy variety is neat too. You get several different classes of zombies with different amounts of health, damage outputs, and attack styles. For the most part you get ones that walk towards you and attack. Eventually you reach spitter-like enemies that fire green globs. Considering each direct hit takes away 20 hitpoints (You start out with 200), I'd suggest dodging those. You also have a couple zombie bosses.  Overall it's a fun game to burn time on. You have different gamemodes and if you have friends around you can join up on LAN and fight zombies together. Although online capability would really be the best over anything. So, if you have a few dollars to spend, I'd recommend picking this little gem up.",

            "review_text": "The Basics: Retro Art zombie survival with RPG elements Previous Time Spent: 10 minutes Expectation of learning Curve: low Why I bought this: 2011 zombie craze?  First Impressions: This game is in love with a sort of grindhouse aesthetic, and opens with a film-grainy, retro looking production company logo, before settling into a sort of top down, zombie shooting/beating action rpg. This was clearly released at the height of the low-res/retro indie craze of the early 2010s, so all of the zombies and the main character have a blocky vibe remniscent of something from the NES. And my first 10 minutes gave me a sense of comforting, gory and fairly stupid fun.    My 3 hours: I played through the intro campaign for my 3 hour test-run with the game, consisting of 20 levels in a forgotten and zombie plagued US city in the 80s or 90s. It opens with a standard-issue b-movie explanation for the zombie apocalypse and gives the main character a clear goal, reaching an encampment of survivors who are 20 streets away. In the parlance of the game, a street is a level, which appears to take up some 5 or 6 city blocks , and includes a slowly escalating zombie threat, houses to loot, and a trader who sells weapons, ammo and medical supplies. Additionally, the trader seems to be the only place you can save, so reaching the trader in each level feels like a bit of a milestone.  The main challenge in the game comes from resource management and crisis aversion. Much of the time, you'll be encountering small groups of zombies, but as levels go on, they form larger and more dangerous mobs. Knowing when to slowly take them out with melee attacks, and when to use firearms to take out larger groups more quickly seems to be the key to success here, and it provides a pretty satisfying sense of continuity to the longer campaign. I found myself constantly tempted to use melee, and by the end of the game had a crazy stockpile of ammunition (but had taken a pretty large number of hits). I think there are probably other legitimate strategies to be used.   Character advancement adds an additional layer here, and allows you to figure out styles that work fairly well for you over time. Based on my playthrough, a player earns enough points to upgrade several, but not all skills up to their maximum. The upgrades that I took early on significantly changed the way I played the game, allowing me to be quicker, and better at melee takedowns. When I reached the waves of zombies in the final level, I felt like I had earned the ability to blast my way through hordes of zombies and reach my eventual goal.    High My Highlight: The game really came together for me when I had a huge stockpile of ammo, the ability to move quickly, and a shotgun with a high rate of fire. Being able to decide to shred my way through hordes of the undead and then mop up with melee felt pretty satisfying.   My Verdict: This is pretty satisfying for mostly shutting down the brain and getting out some violent urges in a cutesy retro world, so I'd recommend it for a steam sale purchase.  Next post will be on September 4th, covering Divinity: Original Sin",

            "review_text": "Dead Pixels is a fun little gem for fans of zombies, or the NES era. This game gives you the story in three segments, each giving you the option to play solo or local co-op. They are Dead Pixels, The Solution, and Last Stand.   Dead Pixels is the main campaign, in which you go from street to street, blasting zombies, collecting loot, and visiting stores, all in search of escape. The number of streets you have to traverse, depends on which difficulty you select.  The Solution is very similar, except it's more of a get in/get out scenario. This time you play as one of several convicts, each with unique, non-upgradeable stats.  Last Stand is more of a survival mode, where you see how many waves of the undead you can endure.  Now, onto the main components of the game.  Graphics- The character sprites borrow their style from the first six Mega Man games, so there's no shortage of charm there. The level of detail is on par with plenty of late 80's/early 90's NES games(Most notably Mega Man and River City Ransom). There's also this neat film grain effect to make it feel like a classic Romero zombie flick.  Sound- Not too much to say here. A few metal tracks, some spooky prologue music, and a loungey elevator tune account for the whole soundtrack. The sound effects include chomps, groans, gunshots, explosions, and cash registers. Nothing crazy, but it does the job just fine. Though there is this popping and crackling sound that gives the effect of a damaged film reel, that adds to the cinematic feel.  Gameplay- Though it's not exactly a beat 'em up, it's set up like one. The game draws heavy inspiration from River City Ransom. When you kill zombies, they drop cash that you can spend on weapons/items/stat upgrades at the nearest shop. You can also loot empty buildings. Some loot is useful, while other loot only exists to be flipped for some quick cash. Another point of interest is the encumberment system. Your character has a weight limit. IIf you pick up one too many items, you'll begin to move slower. The more you exceed that limit, the slower you move, which forces you to manage your inventory. The analog stick moves your character, while the triggers allow you to shoot left or right. Shoulder button tosses grenades, while the face buttons are your melee attacks, and menu navigation. The gameplay is simple, yet addictive....like an arcade game with some RPG elements.  Overall, this is a great game, with lots of little references to iconic works of zombie fiction thrown in for good measure. If this sounds like your bag, I'd strongly suggest giving it a try.",
