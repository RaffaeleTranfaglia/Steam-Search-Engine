            "review_text": "Fantastic game. Has enough similar to the old Far Cry games to feel like part of the series, but it's different enough to feel fresh. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the combat is solid, the arrows hitting flesh is satisfying, and the beast mastering is an interesting twist on a great game. The crafting and upgrading is a pretty neat adition to the series as well.   There are a couple downsides:  The repetitive quests. They're similar to Far Cry 3 and 4 in that it's mostly 'Kill everyone in this outpost'.  The story is pretty lackluster. I think it's missing that insane main villian like Vaas and Pagan Min. It's not a bad story, it's just not great.  Overall, I give the game 8/10.",

            "review_text": "So much hate in the reviews and to some degree I can understand. It's so familiar - there's very little unique about Far Cry Primal compaired to the last Far Cry game. It's extremely familiar, but obviously more limiting in your arsenal... in a kinda good way too.  Regardless, I loved it. Great large open sandbox world that was very unforgiving when I first started, but as I leveled up was far more manageable. The landscape was fun to engage, the creatures and chaos fun to defeat (more as I leveled up though), and the storyline interesting and unique.  Aside from the similarity to the game's previous titles I'm actually a little shocked and confused as to where the hate comes from and why there are so many bad reviews. My guess is just a general hate for the larger companies creating games built from their existing engines to save some cash, which this game is probably guilty of, but still does well with... it's still totally worth the price in comparison to the other games in the market.  Summing it up I'd say it wasn't as amazing as the last Far Cry, but it was still a great game and totally worth the price (to me). On top of that I love their creativity to think outside the box and go back in time like that - creativity like that is very risky business and always worth thanking when done well.",

            "review_text": "As an anthropologist this game is pure joy. I just wish one of the parts of the mechanics was to unlock flint-knapping skills. I also wish you could cave paint, though I am glad it plays a small part in the game.  Totally a Far Cry game. Outposts, side quests, collectable hunts, crafting. If you are tired of that move on. If you like that it is here.  There is no over the top Vaas-like villain here, and for some that is clearly disappointing. I could care less. I for one don't play open world games for the story, I play for the world interactions. I guess if you don't read books then you may want more story here. For myself I find the narrative pieces and missions often the most frustrating parts of this whole genre.  In this game the crafting is more integrated than ever before. The materials hunt is meaningful to the gameplay and you use it to replenish your weapons and supplies to the very end of the game.  It is not a caveman sim. It is a Beast-master fable set in a late ice age world. The animal control is key part of the tactics of the game and serve to allow some of the mayhem type of action that was so much fun in FC3 and FC4.  The map textures are familiar. The way you move around on foot is familiar (I never drove that much in the FC games after FC2). Many say the map is reused from FC4, but I never once felt like I was in that map. It is a Far Cry map to be sure, but it still felt fresh to me.  I don't regret a single cent that I spent on this. This is one of the first Ubi-soft games that I actually have managed to get all of the achievements and pick up all of the collectables and enjoyed the process from beginning to end. I love it.  Totally fun.",

This looked like a cheap Copy and paste job. Man was I wrong...I can tell what happened. I feel like this was orginally going to be a 30 dollar release like Blood Dragon but then it ended up just being too good to not make a full release. There are alot of reused assets from FC4 and 3 but it just works so well. In fact the primal setting may make this one the best Far Cry games ever. I am loving every second of it. The soundtrack is also phenominal. The game runs great and looks even better then FC4. The story is very minimilist and works great for thje franchise. 9/10 pick this one up for sure.",

I mainly just wanted to throw spears at people. If you're on the fence, pass. If you really just want to screw around and burn time, buy it.",

But as shown, it's a game that takes place 10 000 years before our time. So it's not supposed to have that. The game offers great graphics and animations (this includes the huge world everything takes place in), a wide variety of creatures to both hunt and tame, many skills to learn, a great amount of different weapons and tools, many ways of combat, and last but not least: missions and quests. The storyline is amazing; and depending on what type of gamemode you choose when you start your new game, the game itself gives you a 'cave-man' feeling. It's definitely an entertaining game with plenty of stuff to keep you busy. I think this is a great game for those interested in the concept.  Recommended? Well the only thing I can say is: Although it's not a cheap game to buy at the moment, I don't regret buying it, at all! So yes, I highly recommend it for those interested in these kind of games. Also, I've never played the older Far Cry games, but I'm sure those of you who played them will like this one too.",

Here are my reasons why:  + Interesting combat by replacing the usual guns + rocket launchers (boring...) with a focus on CQC and stealth which makes it more skillful.  + Graphics are amazing and gives the environment life.  + You (Humans) are not the strongest or smartest hunters around, making you respect your prey and use the environment + tactics to defeat Bears, Tigers, Wolves, etc.  + It's a fun game that encourages you to explore.  + Taming animals is sweet!  - Some quests are repitive (but you are in the Stone Age! you're trying to survive and get by from day to day, not worrying about your Wifi not working or stressing over what to buy your girlfriend for her birthday...)

The NPC's (people) each have their own characteristics and personalities which I think is well thought through and well done. The NPC's (animals) are realistic and awesome to hunt and tame. ( I especially like to shoot at prey, and wait for them to die while runnig away...:P) The Map is GIGANTIC I have played for idk how many hours but still havn't seen HALF of the map, which is, if one might add, also very detailed and realistic! I am having a problem though, that I can't save my progress anymore and every time I quit and restart I have to do the same main quest again, as if I never played. Right now idk how to fix that. Other than that thumbs up and buy it if you like first-person survival and life in a world that is 10,000 years old ;)",

Overall this game does what I want: a cave man style FPS/Hunting/Resource Gathering. The story is minimal, which for me is a big plus. There's lots of stuff to upgrade and a huge map to explore and lots of stuff to scratch your collection itches.  All and all I can fully reccomend this game so someone who wants a game where the focus is really on just hunting and fighting in a primal setting.

Hand-to-hand combat is quick, viscious, and brutal. Bows and spears function well, and having to constantly hunt in order to heal seems very fitting to the period. Being only 2 hours into the game, I've barely made it out of the prologue, so I can't comment on story as yet. But so far so good. This game gets the peroid feel down, and I have to hand it to a corporate publisher like Ubi to allow their team the creative freedom they obviously needed for this game. I'll update this review as needed, but I am very much enjoying this game. That hinges on appreciating it for what it is- escapist FPS with a unique setting. Far Cry games aren't the Cohen brothers and Fargo. They're Michael Mann and Heat, and that's perfectly fine.",

From what i have seen, a lot of the poor reviews are from people that are having problems due to their own computer issues and thus it is often easier to just blame the game. I struggle to see why fans of the Far Cry series would not like this game. It is stunning in every way.  I have played all of the Far Cry series and after playing just 2.9 hours of this one so far, i am completely blown away and addicted. Graphics are breathtaking and i have had no issues at all so far. Game is being played with all settings maxed out (Ultra) @ 1920x1200 and it is smooth as silk (i7 4790K @4GHz OC'd to 4.7, 16GB Memory, R9 390 @8Gb). In the 3 hours i have played, i still havent even hit 4% of the game yet. The map is massive and the beauty of it compels you to explore and take in the scenery and explore some more. Easier to give you an example of what i mean. I was wondering across the mountains and decided to find a nice spot and sit and wait for some birds to fly across with Bow and Arrows at the ready. To my left, a huge Elk came wandering by. Me being a bit itchy fingered i drew back the bow and fired an arrow into the Elk. Unsurprisingly it ran away and so i continued in wait to line a good shot up on some birds. 5 Minutes later, i received a pair of huge Elk Antlers up my back side. It had circled and flanked me and attacked me savagely. While i was trying to back away and react, a Wolf jumped on the Elk and tore it to shreds. I waited till the Elk was dead and then killed the wolf and skinned them both. Then i continued on with my bird hunt and eventually got a couple. At this rate i am going to have many hours of breathtaking fun. Money well spent and anyther great Far Cry game. Possibly even the best of the series.  That is what Far Cry Primal brings you. Unique experiences, beauty and complete freedom. Would definitely recommend. Abolutely love the game.",

            "review_text": "First off, I've only played 3 Ubisoft games including this one, so this won't be a biased opinion. I am neither a fanboy nor a hater, so I will give credit where it's due.  My first reaction to launching the story was 'These graphics are beautiful, and it really suits the era they were going with' and that it runs smoothly on high settings for my out of date PC (r9 270x, AMD FX 6300 6-core processor (I think that's my processor, can't remember) and 8 gb of ram) I was always able to get 50-60 fps, with some dips to the 30's every once in a while. So far, I've only had 1 crash and that was because I had 2 games open without noticing. Don't ask how I didn't notice.  I've always been a fan of the primal era with crude tools and this really makes me feel giddy when I play. So far, the only complaint I have is the melee system. It's really simple. Go up to someone, bash their head in, repeat. The ranged system is spot on.  Now let's talk about taming and animals in general. Taming seems too easy. To tame an animal, just walk up to the animal, throw bait, hold e. It really should be a little harder. Like the great beast taming. Those are a challenge and they feel rewarding.  Once you get a saber, you really don't need any other animal. The saber has a great mix of strength, stealth and speed. It feels rather OP. The jaguar is extremely useful for taking over bases. I use the owl (which is a great replacement for binoculars btw), tag all the enemies, drop some rot fumes on the strong guys to make them attack their own kind, and send in my jaguar to clear the guards where I can then move in and start sniping people with my longbow as the jaguar takes down anyone that notices. And if I get noticed, then I call in my saber or bear to wreak havoc.  The hitboxes for enemies are great. I never get an issue where it shows I hit them, but it doesn't do damage. I'm able to easily get headshots even with no reticle.  The story is actually pretty great. It is comical, intense, and has some emotion to it. Some games make it so you feel nothing towards the main protagonists. But this game makes you hate them with your guts, where you WANT to kill them. But then with Ull's death, you feel something for him. You kind of feel sad for him. I won't say why to avoid spoilers, but you feel like he was actually human instead of a ruthless cannibal.  The characters are great and you feel emotion towards some of them. Like when you get a mission notification from someone, I felt like saying 'HELL YEAH ANOTHER MISSION FROM YOU' and some of the deaths towards the people in your tribe actually made you feel emotion towards them. They had a good buildup to a lot of characters.  Even walking around the wilderness with your minimap off is a blast. You never know what you'll expect. Whether it's a group of sabers, or a random camp or fun side mission. You never know what to expect! After I beat the story and tamed all the beasts, I turned off my minimap and just started walking around.  Yes, it used the map from Far Cry 4, but they used it as a template. The terrain is absolutely nothing alike, and this concept has been used in gaming for years, and it will be continued to be used.   All in all, I recommend this game 100%. Most of the negative reviews are just Ubisoft haters that didn't give the game a chance, or just have an error when trying to launch the game which will get fixed eventually. If you like the primal setting in games, you will love this game.   That's the end of my opinion. I will update it if I think of more to add or if my opinion of it changes.",

Some have commented that this game feels too simalar in style to the previous two games, and in some ways that is true. However, its not a bad thing. The Far Cry theme fits very well with this time period. In fact, it feels more realistic and on edge knowing that at any moment you could be attacked by a gang of cannibals or a sabertooth tigher. The gameplay, once you get it down, is really fun and brutal. If you like melee and traditional forms of combat, you will probably enjoy this. The graphics are also very nice, even on low settings the game is stunning. The combat upgrades, control over various animals, and the village building system all give Far Cry Primal a unique feeling. Definitely worth a try for those of you that are skeptical.",

Did I meantion you can also ride some of them? Or they are complaining about crashes or glitches etc. I have put about 15 hours in of actual gameplay. I have not yet experienced anything gamebreaking or that is annoying. Once The game was lagging and I just had to restart it and it was working fine afterwards. This game is great, It is so much fun, the graphics are beautiful and I just cannot keep from playing it. However my only problem with the game, not sure if it's a glitch or what, but if you tame a Cave Bear, you cannot mount it. But the cave bear out puts a lot of damage and can take a lot of hits. But I would like it if we could ride the Cave Bear instead of just a regular bear, because I mean you can ride a mammoth, So we should be able to mount it. But overall this is my favorite Far Cry game. I enjoy the different weapons, Like there are three types of bows, Just a regular Bow, then you have the longbow, and my personal favorite is the Double Bow where you shoot two arrows at once. Did I mention you can ride a Mammoth. This game is so much fun, sometiems it does seem repetitive, for example, the Bonfires/Outpost, but so were the towers in Far Cry 3. You ran up a tower, and you got a piece of the map. Kinda the same except you have to kill some enemies then light the bonfire. But other than that the missions are fun. I would defintley but this game, I'm not even halfway through the game and i've got 16 hours in it.",

Being able to absolutely customize the controls per my gaming mouse (Naga Epic) is absolutely fantastic. The graphics are solid. The combat is fluid and honestly terrifying at certain points on the harder difficulties. Being able to dive bomb the enemies to allow for more stealth related camp takes is amazing. I personally prefer the Jaguar for stealth and Brown Bear for pure force so far, while using the White Wolf to travel. The sheer terror of a competent AI (in most situations) is something I love in a game. The fact that enemy archers can shoot you while zig zagging kind of sucks, but it makes it more challenging :D The bombs and traps are fantastic and ridiculously fun to use. Taming can be a bit of a pain until you get the hang of it.  The worst thing in the world is making a tactical retreat from about 10 enemies only to get mauled by a leopard. lol  Honestly I'm finding it hard to find much of anything wrong with the game. The anti-stealth tactics are somewhat a little too skyrim like in the fact that I feel like they could care less when their friends get an arrow to the face, but other than that, I'm thoroughly enjoying the game so far.

            "review_text": "To preface; I will say that this is not a full review of Far Cry Primal, rather this is an overview. I am doing this because.. I feel that too many people are giving this game a negative review wihout much or any substance objectively. That and in the three or three and a half hours of plaaytime, I found this to be a very fun game, it is exciting and it is entralling. I would aactually like to see Ubisoft experrment more with different time periods, eras. And I feel that people who on the fence should know that this is worth the $60 price tag. I'll update this after I have completed the game, as some things may change. I'm sure I will develop criticisms over the course of the game, etc.. I will not mention anything about the story yet, because I have not progressed far enough into the story. The character animations and VO work that I have experienced so far is convincing and is outstanding work.  So, what makes Primal so captivating, I'll tell you. The setting in itself is one of the major reasons. The world of Oros is beautiful, full of life and is a sensory overload when it comes to the audio; a good thing. Teaming with wildlife and, yes other cavemen. Depite its beauty, this world that has been created is dangerous. You can find yourself into some serious trouble in Oros very quickly! The weapons are primitive and they do lack complex or cool looking animations, but you're a caveman, you're just trying to survive. When attacked and under stress, with your aderline pumping, and a lack of formal training, you are going to swing your club as wildly as possible, and a spear is a thrusting weapon, not a slashing weapon. You're not a highly-trained martial-artist wielding a staff or or a sword. With that said the combat is brutal and fun! That's what matters! It is satisfying to throw a spear into a mans face as it is into an animal, same thing with clubing someone to death. The hunting is great fun! I enjoy the fact how I have to track whatever game I have shot with my bow or thrown spear, because as someone who actually hunts, animals don't just drop dead on the spot most of the time. It's a nice change to see in a game. Many have complained of the partially made up language. Ubisoft did work with experts to craft a language that would be believable, though not 100% accurate. You can hear the emotions converyed through the voice actors and I appluad this apporach. The subtitles do not bother and it adds another layer of immserion to a game that very atmospheric. There is no other game, that I know of that has a wrold like Oros. It is unique in that regard, even if Ark has a world similar. In Ark you have firearms, which to me would detract from the experience overall.  I will recommend to everyone to play on 'expert' difficulty and to turn most, if not all of your HUD elements off. You'll rely pretty much solely on audio cues and it'll take a while, but you will feel scared and you should feel that thrill, that anxiety. Of both being scared and exploring a land you know nothing of. Get out there and get lost, feel the experience and bask in the atmosphere! You are not at the top of the food-chain, you're far from it. I find myself, especailly at night, which is so much different from the dynamics of daytime play, always being cautious and listening very carefully to sounds. As well as hunting for animals that appear at night only. I am having as close to a caveman experience as I think we may ever get in a AAA title. And this experience feels authentic, as far as video games go. This game as is so far in my experience gets a solid recommendation.  EDIT: Having played more of the game, I feel that the story is good enough so far. It's not top tier, it is not The Witcher 3 calibre of story-telling; but it is not a bad story. What is most important that I've realized is that now that I have tamed most of the beasts, and have uncovered aa good portion of the map. The game has become highly addicting! I am about 11 percent complete with the game. My one major complaint is that night cycles should really last longer; as well as the frustration of losing a rare beast because it died. I like the mechanic on paper. It's more immersive, but it isn't fun to try to track down another rare black leopard.",

You knew what you were getting into.  I have had 2 crashes in 14 hours of game play its a new game ♥♥♥♥ happens. Had a brief issue with Uplay but that resolved in around 10 mins on Uplay's end. ♥♥♥♥ happens.  For those complaining that the map is recycled I suggest to you that Oros is Kryat in prehistory. The work they did on making a 'living world' is well worth looking at a similar map as the one for Kryat. I'm gestimating that the full Oros map is at least 50% larger than Farcry 4 just from what I've seen so far.   The story is fine. Hasn't hooked me like FC3 but I really liked the story for 3. But makes sense and is coherent   Graphics are beutiful on my system. Definately an improvement over FC4. For those having issues I suggest upgrading.  At the end of the day Far Cry Primal is a unique title covering a period that isnt often addressed in video games and is well worth a look.",

            "review_text": "Personally, I love far cry primal.I LOVE primitive or medieval gameplay and I think this game was more tailored to people that enjoy that, versus gunplay and explosives, which was what far cry was about before. The game FEELS like far cry 4, you can definitely tell it's the same engine. There is also a lot of the same ideas you're used to from far cry 3 and 4, such as hunting for crafting upgrades, capturing towers, i mean bonfires/outposts, but there's just enough that's unique to make is work perfectly, unlike between for far cry 4 (for me personally at least).   There is just something 'primal' and savage about bashing some dudes face in with a fiery club, or watching your arrow sink into someone's eye socket as they rush you with a spear. Or speaking of Spears, watching your freakishly strong arm ragdoll them back when you throw your spear into their gut is also quite satisfying, I swear I'm not a serial killer... There's numerous upgrades for most of the weapons and inventory types, probably due to the fact there is not a huge selection. Your primary weapons are the bow (of which there are 3 I've found so far, the fast beginning bow, a slow, powerful longbow, and a double arrow bow with aim assist), the spear, three club types (regular, Apex club, and two-handed), shards, which are throwing knives, and thats about it aside from traps, and a sling that makes your distraction rocks lethal. Despite the limited arsenal, it is extremely satisfying to use, at least for ranged weapons. The longbow is especially op due to the extra range and power. However, melee just lacks interaction in my opinion. You basically just sit there and swing and hear impacts, but don't really feel it, the fight doesn't really have a ton of immersion I guess and feels like hack and slash but without satisfying kills. However, with how great ranged is you won't really notice it, especially as you upgrade takedowns and unlock more bows. You can clear a squad in two seconds from a distance or surprising them.  The story is not really what I would call enthralling, but moreso the world that you are in is and makes you interested in what's going on. The non-spoiler version from what I've seen so far (I've mostly done all the side/crafting quests for the village) the Udam are a cannibalistic tribe attacking you initially, and the other people that are blue which haven't been introduced as in conflict with the Wenja yet, but they're the ruling southern tribe, whereas Udam are northern, and you're ♥♥♥♥♥ from both directions in the middle xD You have to swell your tribe after you find the first crazy Wenja and keep them safe from the neighboring tribes while you swell your territory. More population provides extra bonuses like; the passive resources you receive each day increases, you unlock upgrades for structures which in turn unlocks new quests, skills, and items/weapons, and at higher population an xp bonus ( as by the time you have like 80 population you should probably have most of the weapons and tools unlocked so skills are your main grind left to you)  Minor complaint but I would say the world kind of blends together at times due to how prevalent earth tones from the era, which forces you to use hunter vision for everything, which wouldn'y be that bad if it wasn't a hideous low res matte, yellow overlay on anything important, but is necessary when your'e sniping archers in bushes and dark huts. However, I also am playing with only the reticle on for immersion, which I would reccomend because the game is gorgeous.  I'll update as I actually get into the story but as long as you can run the game, you're off to an amazing start. Also since I've seen people complain about the Division, I played the beta with no issues, no crashes, and on ultra, basically the exact same experience I'm having with Primal right now... You can look at my specs on my profile (although I have 10 now not Windows 7) and how they match up with yours, anything similar to mine shouldn't have any issues, although I cant help you with your firewall, only apologize you're missing out on some fantastic, primitive badassery.   My opinion: 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "The badger is a phoenix 10/10  Legitimately though:  Simply, this game is phenomenal.  There are very few games I would list as 'Masterpeices', by which I mean that they not only define but alos entirely a genre or theme. To this date my only other 'Masterpiece' is Red Dead Redemption. This game is exactly everything you could ever want from a game about the struggles of primitive man. The prevelent themes of which I mean the importance of the alliance between Man and animals (primarily man and wolf but thats less important given story elements), the presence of Neanderthals in the evolution of man (their defeat/ultimate integration) and the importance of religion in the development of mankind. I'll admit I have a level of bias given my personal preferance to the major themes and their design choice of trying to adhere to history (or prehistory as it might be) as much as possible for example referring to linguistics professionals for the language and likewise for how weapons and clothings and such resembled what they had back then. So as to be expected the plot is simple though it is more than enough fleshed out by the backstory of the cultures involved and as such I found it very fulfilling (despite and including the nuances) in the plot department.  That being said (spoiler warning kinda) there are only three catagories of weapons the Club, the Bow and the Spear though all three of which are versatile and varied enough to be satisfing in their own way. Clubbing someone and wantching them ragdoll away is just as satisfying as watching someone cop an arrow to the face and collapse to the ground. And that all separate from watching the tamed animal takedowns or the owl kill people.  If your looking for Far Cry 4 then perhaps look elsewhere as more than a few people have mentioned the lack of weapons and vehicles make them unhappy, though riding animals was more than an adequate replacement and the weapon variations was more than enough to keep my attention and interest. If you want as accurate an experience as you'll ever get to an engaging experience of what it was like to be primitive man then this is exactly what you should buy. Personally, the weapons, gameplay, mission and animals were all very exciting and fulfilling including the very tongue in cheek character Urki. That all being said its very much a Far Cry game, if you like pulling your thumb back in place then with a satisfying snap and pop or a varied cast of weird and interesting characters and their subsequent development then you'll be more than pleased.  I could not speak enough about how much I enjoyed this game and I have waited since it was announced as DLC for Far Cry 3. I'm not even a Far Cry fanboy, I have yet to even buy number 4 and this game blew me away. Please buy this game!!!!!!  In regards to other reviews about the game, my firewall and computer never had a single iota of issue with the game. My comp is an average gaming rig from 2008 and it runs it almost perfectly on High (aside from a second or two of lag as I spawn in) and it looks superb! Breathtaking even if you take the time to just look around at the gorgeous scenery.  Legitimate rating: 10/10",

Started as a normal play through, but restarted after downloading the survivor mode yesterday. FC3 and FC4 were by far the best when modded and with all the HUD junk turned down/off. In the same way, FCP is best played in the new survivor mode - with no minimap and pretty well nearly everything else turned off. Like FC2, in survivor mode this game is really immersive. It takes some of the repetitiveness out of quests. You need to be well prepared (i.e., arrows stocked up etc.) before attacking an outpost, or hunting a bear. They've finally got the immersiveness worked out - took heaps of modding of FC3 and FC4 to get the point across to the devs how it should be done and how [some] people want to play. I wouldn't recommend playing it any other way, unless you want a faster, run-and-gun walkthrough, and that being the case you probably won't like it. The weaponry/lack of it adds to the immersiveness and I actually think it's done well (I think poison blow darts to mimic sniping would have been a good addition though). The bee bombs are a really nice take on grenades. This is clearly a FC game (as the name suggests) with many of the standard mechanics from FC3, FCBD and FC4, but these mechanics were great and what made those games so enjoyable. But there are some new mechanics, such as the owl and the use of pets (showed up in FC4 - Shangri La, only). And sure the quests and other related scripted events are 'reskins' of those in FC4 (and FC4 from FC3), but that's why this game comes out within a reasonable period of time following FC4. It's kind of sad (in the sense that it'll turn off people who probably otherwise would enjoy the game) to see such well-presented (on my GTX980 on Ultra it looks beautiful, and I haven't even installed the 4K texture pack yet - some FPS issues every now and then (I caught it momentarily dropping to 30 or 40 FPS), but generally running at or above 60 FPS) game receive so many thumbs down. I think if you liked the immersiveness of FC2 (such as the jamming guns and malaria, and not having a minimap) or you liked turning down the HUD on FC3 and FC4 and carefully planning stealthy outpost attacks, and you have a lot of time on your hands, then you'll like FCP on survivor mode.",

I will say that I encountered nothing ground breaking in this game.  Criticism...... 1. Crafting is less than impressive. I'm a fan of the RPG games where it takes a lot of effort and time to get to a weapon than can dominate anything. By leveling the spear to max, I was easily able to dispatch the enemy with a single throw, (FYI....the Spear is a bad ♥♥♥ weapon!!) 2. The village crafting is incredibly simplified and anti-climatic. After you build the first hut for each member, the majority fo them provide no more than exp points. 3. Not a lot of content.  Awesomeness.... 1. Graphics! Fantastic. 2. The combat is pretty cool. Actually requires some technique when engaging groups.  3. I'm a fan of the concept. I think they could have gone deeper though. Not impressed with the story line nor the side missions.  summary. The game is entertaining. If you're looking for a classic Far Cry game set in the stone age, maybe not your cup of tea. You will get more content with 3 or 4.

During the first quarter of the game it was on normal till I realized I could change it to expert. At that point the game came alive for me. I had a lot of fun with the hunting and some of the boss fights. Even on expert some of it was fairly easy to me. Only a few boss fights were rough. I stayed with only 4 health bars I never did up those. I got all the crafting I could done before I started on the missions. Which, you can get most of it done early which is probably why I felt that not to much was challenging. Also as soon as I could tame a beast I went straight for the sabertooth and both rare lion/jaguar. Then on the path to the bloodfang sabertooth.   The game to me was exciting and thrilling. I really enjoyed it but would of rather payed $40 for it since it is the shortest game I have played in years. I'll probably replay the game at a later date. Unlike FC 3&amp;4 I enojyed this one to the end. I did not explore the caves or get all the trophy pick up things.   Take Down Chains are OP. I was expecting a more stealth game. An it can be but I had a hard time making that play style work. Probably cuz I tend to suck. Spear and dual arrow bow are lots of fun. For the most part I just charged into bases throwing the spear, sling shots and shards to quickly one shot everything. Just remember run over the bodies to get your spears back.

Graphics setup are low, normal, high and ultra high and saves are done by way of the 'check point' system. I built a new high spec PC in December 2015, so it should run this game with little to no problems, but one hour in on Ultra High settings the cpu shot up to 60c which is very hot, after reducing the graphic setting to Normal and setting up a profile for the cpu fan to start at 75% and go up from there, the issue is all but solved. With all that said, for me the game is a blast, you play the role of hunter, gather, working your way through the map via points of intrest and in doing so earn XP and skill points that increase your characters abilities. For now it is a single player experience only, Co-Op would be awesome and is probabley down the road in the form of DLC.",

Also you may have heard the map uses the same shape as the previous game only redone and has a different look........yea so? Does that make it not fun? Its been smooth sailing and tons of fun for me so far. Im glad they went a different route with this game and didnt make another modern day Farcry shooter as we have already had 4 of those. If you like large land masses, different biomes, different dangerous tribes, taming a massive cave bear only to send him to eat a caveman, and a large collection and variety of prehistoric beasts and killing said beasts with primitive weapons then this game is for you.

            "review_text": "I'm going to start by saying that if you have played Far Cry 3 or 4, and expect the same sort of experience with Primal, don't. FCP is a wonderful, beautiful open-world game, but it strays away from the expected storylines of the previous games. Before, there was a clear main antagonist that you had to overcome, a bad guy that was wrecking your world. In FCP, the bad guy is nature. After playing for a little while I was suddenly hit with 'I'm no longer at the top of the food chain.'. When sabretooth tigers appeared, I ran. When Mammoths or Rhinos started to get frisky, I ran. Even when I encountered a pack of wolves, I ran. And I loved it. The thrill of whats around the next bend, of seeing the eyes of wolves glowing at the edge of your torchlight, waiting for it to go out, crouching in bushes, of finally bringing down your first mammoth, all are what keep me playing. FCP is a game about survival in a harsh, beautiful world.  Pros: +Beautiful scenery +The spear is spectacularly done +The fire aspects are very well done +The UI and HUD are well balanced and easy to access mid-battle  Cons: -Combat is pretty repetetive -Urki  Other: I very much enjoy the man-vs-beast aspect of this game, maybe even more so than man-vs-man of the others games. While it still does retain two human 'enemies', they do not feel like the focus of the game at all. However this feature could swing either way for other people. It's a game about survival, and I think it hits that nail on the head pretty well. Plus, the massive trees, frigid tundras, grassy plains, and shining marshes are amazing to wander through.",

            "review_text": "Overall rating- 8/10  after sinking in 8 hours on the release day i had noticed a lot of small problems. First of all, most short and basic animations are extremely pour, lets start off with the search animation. Upon killing an enemy you can hold down E to loot them, the animation is you put your hand on their body for one and a half seconds and Whala youve just got 2 logs of wood. Now, i won't go off naming all the animations which i thought they could've done a much better job, especially Ubisoft. When i watched the trailer and found out you could tame beasts I immediately got super hyped and expected this game to be the best in the franchise yet, however the taming concept of the game is extremely pour. Throwing a piece of bait, an animal approaches, you crouch up to the animal hold down E and thats it. What does make it somewhat ok is you need to invest your skill points which you acquire via leveling up which is done by completing missions, events and so on. One thing they did an amazing job on though was keeping me lost in the game, i never wanted to stop playing for everytime a got a new beast or crafted a new weapon i got a amusing sensation which no other Far Cry game pleased me so much with. The crafting aspect of this game is decent, compared to Far Cry 4 is much better. In the previous game crafting was only done by skinning animals, Far Cry Primal includes skinning animals and gathering resources including, different types of wood, different types of stone, slate, reeds and much more. Overall the cinematic captures this game offers are fascinating including the opening scene really got my heart racing. One thing which was quite annoying was the map. The landscape was done well however, the texture was all the same, from the snow to the forest the ground all looked like the same texture. To conclude, Far Cry Primal was a good game which i am still happy with, i will most likely having over one hundred hours on this game hence it is still amazing even though it has a couple ups and downs.",

I saw another later on that had war paint on a nipple. I really don't care what you think about me, a game like this should have exposed breasts... my pet wolf stopped to take a ♥♥♥♥... pets stop to eat the things they have killed. This is a game that tries very hard to give you a world as real as posible and it does.  I have had no technical issues with the game. I always loved bow combat in other Far Cry games. I was walking down a bath and there are butterflies and other random bits of things blowing in the wind. I was literally eaten by a saber tooth tiger!  I find it funny that people give a Far Cry game a bad review because it is like a Far Cry game. Do you buy football games and get mad because it has the same throwing mechanic as the last game?  I also find it funny that people say the game is short... Its an open world game. The point is to explore it. I'm 11 hours in and 12% done and I bring this up because of a review I read where the person was 2 hours in and 10% done. There is a reason this game is tagged as 'open world.' I expect to get between 30 and 60 hours out of this game simply because I don't treat missions as a race I have to get through asap.  I get what they are doing with the voice acting...

So I decided to remove that review since a lot of people were upset. So here is my quick breakdown of this game  Optimization: I run a GTX 970 AMD 4300 Quad Core and the game runs... Ok. Not AMAZING but Ok, I do go above 60fps and stay there for a bit of time and then the frames tend to drop to around 40-50. This is on High settings, either way I feel that it should be running a lot smoother than this but either way the port is OK.  Graphics: Awesome. Very nice to look at and very detailed. From the grass, trees, sun glare and even the character models. the only fault would be the water textures which are really odd looking. but overall it really is a beautiful game to look at.  Gameplay: Combat is instantly familier to the old Far Cry games and nothing has really changed much. There is a new beastmater mode where you can call apon a compainion to fight with you in the wild which is pretty cool. So far I have a White Wolf and I love sneaking into camps and ordering my wolf to take out 1 enemy then I jump on another. Instead of guns its clubs and spears, And of course a bow. But combat overall in the game is fun but for anyone who is looking for something diffrent to the previous Far Cry games, you will be disappointed.  The World and Objectives: So the world is pretty big but sadly not as big as FC4 &amp; FC3. The objectives are rather copy and paste from previous games. Bonfires act as signal towers to reveal new areas of the map, and enemy camps which you can take out and claim new land. There is a little meta game at the side which is to build your village. Pretty simplistic but still a fun little scavenge mission for you to run around and find the parts needed to build new structures.  Final Verdict: Far Cry Primal (PC) Still has the look and feel of a good Far Cry game. The combat is fun,the graphics are nice and the beastmaster system is fun to play around with and try out new beasts to fight along side you. But for some it will feel TOO familier to previous games, like a copy paste Far Cry with Spears and Clubs replacing Guns. Same with the objectives. And also to add that there is no co-op is really sad since that feature was a cool addition to FC4.  Score-7/10",

I especially appreciate the game supporting multiple monitor setups. It works flawlessly and adds that much more to the beauty of the game.  As for the game itself, right now I am amazed at how much fun it is to be in such a primitive time. People say its just a reskin of far cry, and yes it is slightly a reskin. But for every one thing they reskinned, they added 10 things that aren't reskinned. So far an amazing game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves open world games and looking for something new.",

One hit from a Saber Tooth, Bear or Elk and you're dead. The pet companions definitely add a great touch, and nothing is more satisfying than spearing an enemy off a cliff. If you enjoy the hunting, crafting, upgrading, and intense environments common to the Far Cry series, I would highly recommend buying. It's worth the full price; however, if you tend to care mostly about the storyline in this series, I would definitely recommend holding off until a price drop. The story isn't the most engaging (mainly due to the language barrier). I mostly enjoy hunting, crafting, and outposts in this series so I would recommend buying.",

            "review_text": "This game is weird. It actually feels like the Far Cry 3 DLC Blood Dragon, in a way; it's Far Cry, yet it's not. For the most part, it's pretty good. It's fun, the mechanics are familiar, the world is beautiful. It feels like it hand-holds a little less than the previous titles, so if you haven't played any, it may be a little tricky to start, but it's nothing mind-boggling.   However, I am glad I waited for a sale, because it certainly doesn't measure up to a mainline title in terms of value. The writing in Far Cry has never been good, but at least it was memorable and often funny; here, it's BORING and completely forgetable. This is made worse by the fact that everyone speaks in fakey caveman speak with subtitles. In a real foreign language one doesn't speak, the inflection and finer points still come through, but in a fake language, it has all the subtelty of children speaking (especially being cavemen who ARE practically children). Blah blah ME MAD NOW blah blah. I can't name a single character in this game except Dah, because duh, and nothing has made me laugh at all in this game, no Vaas, no Pagan Min, no Huxley, no tongue-in-cheek item descriptions (they did have a cameo of an established character that is actually a little amusing, but I won't ruin it). In fact, there are no descriptions of practically anything, you find a new place and it's just there. Why? What for? Who built it? What's it's purpose? Nothing, no emotional investment at all. And some of the scenes make the previous games look genius by comparison; I could understand those protagonists trying not to immediately kill everyone they see, but this guy is a warrior caveman, why is he bumbling into traps and letting tiny ladies push him around? The setting is just cavemen tribes at war. Your tribe is no better than the others, but hey, they wear green and your evil enemies wear red and blue, clearly you deserve to win. Also, the collectibles? No explanation. Literally, there's not even flavor-text for ANY of them.  As for gameplay, it's mostly okay, but it's obvious they rejiggered their existing system to fit the new setting and it's not quite right. Stealth is harder; tagging is harder and not even available for a while, it's harder to see even when you do tag (the shadows or outlines are far less noticeable), and the natural setting makes sneaking around generally very difficult (fewer corners and buildings and more randomness). Also, of course, there is no sniping, and your only consistent long-range weapon is the bow, which has never been that great either. This makes most combat into melee contests, which is a bit hard in first person, losing sight of the enemy, getting turned around, etc. There are only a handful of weapons; you can 'craft' upgrades to them, there's alot of crafting in this game, but they don't feel meaningful, it just makes your club hit harder. It's really shallow with limited choice. Your other main weapon are animals; for one, you get an owl. You can 'look through his eyes', so to speak, to survey the area, which is great, but you can also divebomb and kill enemies with 100% accuracy. Yes. To get that stealth bonus, just keep summoning your owl and insta-killing everything but heavies. There's a cool down, but it's less than I've spent in previous games lining up shots with a .50. Otherwise, you can tame animals to fight with you. The system is easy and there are several animals. Oddly enough though, you start with a mid-range choice, instead of at the bottom of the ladder. And it's easy to quickly get the best generic companions (there are a few quest-specific recruits as well). There seems like depth to the system, but no, get a Sabretooth and never look back. Your companion is immortal, although he can be laid out temporarily, and you can order them to attack, to stay, to sneak, even to sneak attack sometimes. It's cool, but like the rest of the combat, you quickly realize that this is it. Also, there's a...well, detective vision from the Arkham Batman games here, where everything is portrayed in a washed-out, high-contrast view where everything you can interact with (vines to climb, treasure, enemies) glow yellow. It's really annoying and ugly, but you'll probably use it all the time because it's just so useful, and sometimes literally required.  So how does the game play overall? It's okay, mostly running around the map taking out guys either by animal or by running up and clubbing them to a pulp. There's just less emotion, less fun, fewer options. You can craft alot more upgrades, but they are still mostly just 'carry more spears, carry more arrows'. Not having the gun system, where you had to carefully weigh and balance your load out, makes the game really shallow; you can sleep in a tent located every 500 feet, so you literally never feel like you never have to go back to camp, never sell any inventory (there is no such inventory, no money, no trade), never buy ammo, nothing. You get into a groove early on and it never changes with new weapons or new enemy types. The characters, the quests, the collectables, the plot, the locations, the animals, NONE of them have any meaning or even humor. You learn how to kill things then you just keep killing things, there's not even a central narrative, just fight the bad guys. It's fine for what it is, a game where you run around and beat things to death, and sometimes ride a mammoth into battle, it has that awesome 80's feel like (as I mentioned) Blood Dragon did, if not so overt, but it's really very shallow and lacks any kind of replayability or even different play styles, unless you count 'a little stealth' and 'no stealth' as different enough. I've played the previous games several times; I don't think I will ever again play this game after I wrap it up in a day or two, because it basically feels like one 40-hour DLC. I'd say it was over-priced, in the end, probably worth about $40. Oh, and the DLC for it? Completely not worth it. Seriously. One group of people I would recommend this game for are the hardcore gamers who like challenges; you can turn off all the help this game has, make your character far easier to kill, and even activate a perma-death option. If you thought beating Devil May Cry without ever getting hit was fun, well, here you go. All in all, it's a fun game to play once, but I'd wait for a sale.  Edit: I completely forgot to talk about the leveling in this game. It's actually better than previous games, I think, at least it makes more sense, with different people teaching you different skills (the hunter, the fighter, the inventor, etc). There are more trees, so you don't feel locked into learning useless low level skills to get to the good ones quite so often. What I don't like, however, is that you stop earning experience when you need about 35 more points to max out the skill tree. Why? Because the rest of the points are rewards from quests. But not story quests, or quests for your characters, or anything with a purpose, no, these are just completely random people you stumble across who go 'Go save some people from that camp over there!' and you kill a few mooks, done. And there are several DOZEN of these. All of the game's other quests, as well as the randomly spawning events (like in Far Cry 4), are already kind of repetitive, now they want you to do dozens of utterly meaningless kill-quests just to finish leveling up. This is just a lazy way to add more content and try to incentivize you to do it. Fortunately, there are several skills you can ignore without even feeling it, so I didn't actually care when this happened to me and I figured out what they expected me to do. What a cop-out.",

The stealth in the game IMO kinda sucks. The Black Jaguar description states that it sneaks up on unsuspecting enemies and kills them, This is wrong it growls at the person before attacking every time and the dude turns around and freaks out alerting the whole camp.   I have yet to find a real use for most of the animals, the Sabertooth is pretty much all I ever use, with the occasional Cave Bear. This doesn't mean the other animals are not badass, they each have their own epic set of takedown animations that never get old, they just get rekt so easily in battle that it gets annoying having to heal them every 5 seconds.

And honestly I love it, they really changed up the game with beasts and made each fight special. Also it isent to easy, you only have so many spears and arrows, so each fight have to be carefully planned.  The graphics is great, it builds on the same engine as FC4 so thats what you can expect, the map is fairly simular to FC4 as well, but since FC4 engine is solid it isent a problem.  basicly, its a great challanging game with some new thinking! Many hours to enjoy if you like the FC series!",

But little did i know, i was being stalked myself by the worst of of them, a damn sabertooth !!! It was the longest and most frightening experience ive ever had in any game... for 20 minutes atleast i was running for my life from this Hungry cat and finally got lucky (kinda) running into a pack of mammoths that eventually killed the sabertooth... but for some reason they turned their attention to me and now i was being chased by 3 very angry Mammoths...

The crafting system was nice and all but way too easy access to stuff, just by those 4h I played alloweded me to upgrade weapons and the base buildings way too far for the % I played.   Pro - Stealth combat op - Pets - Pets vs wild animal status (if your pet is stronger than the wild one, they will not attack you due to its presence)  Cons - Stealth combat op, there is really nothing else to play but archer. - Pets, you have to fully heal your pet before you are able to mount it, even if it misses 1 hp. - 'Same' map as Farcry 4. Outlines are 99% the same - Materials are waay too easy to access. - As a stealth player, pets block superhard and pull aggro when you dispatch em.  Reasons to buy: - You have money to spend and need your daily fix injected. - You actually want the game, go ahead, you'll get some good hours. - I sound like a BabyRage in your ears.

So Im getting a refund and May buy later when fixed, This issue is just like Batman AK.",

This game is extremely immersive and the hunting is one of the strongest parts of all the far cry games, the controls are great ans so are the graphics. But what lets this game down outway the things that are good about this game, such as the feeling of similarity since far cry 3, but if your new to the franchise and have not played far cry 4 or 3 you may think that it does not involve you, but it does. The past three games are so simular its just, kill, craft, kill, hunt, but the formular was good, but its now old, i loved far cry 3 and 4, my fave games of all time. I would let it slide if it wasnt for poor linea story, i did like 3 hours of missions and had unlocked the last 2 missions, like wtf, i know your surposed to 'prepare' yourself, so thats what i did, and i did it so well that the missions wasn't hard. If you want a good far cry game, just play far cry 4, even if you played it, its still more fun than this one.",

I dont really care about the game itself. I bought this game only because the store page says that the game contains 17 languages including simplified chinese, and then when I entered the game I couldnt find simplified chinese anywhere in the menu, WTF??? Ubisoft, seriously?? Thats how you treat the players from an uprising country in steam?",
