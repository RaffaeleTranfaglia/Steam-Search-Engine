One down side is the co-op screen when set to 'dynamic' sometimes messes around with the screen and gets disoriented on which charcter am I playing. Above all great game! I played local co-op to finish the game and looking forward to make it 100%. Would love to see a Workshop edition come to the game with extra maps and puzzles  10/10  ",

            "review_text": "It is a okay game. I recommend it, but you have to know that its the same old Lego formula with no innovation whatsoever.  Pros:  + runs super smooth + great controller layout + pretty lenghty game (a little bit too stretched out at times) + easy to understand even for younger kids + beautiful graphics + love for detail, the world is filled with easter eggs and little nods to the Jurassic Park universe + local coop + all Jurassic Park movies were recreated + various characters that have different abilities, even the smallest staff member is in here + they didnt just recreate scenes from the movies, they actually thought out clever new levels, sceneres and additional paths for the heroes to go through, along with a faithful Lego recreation of the beloved movies + in the german dub, many voice actors from the original movie reprised their roles, which is fantastic + Nvidia 3D TV Play looks awesome. Like its meant to be played in stereoscopic 3D (even cutscenes are 3D) + create-your-own-dinosaur + replayability if you want all the characters and collectibles  Cons:  - unfortunatley its the same old formula that is being used for EVERY Lego game, destroy everything, pick up coins, build something to unlock new path and repeat, it gets old pretty fast. I was disappointed to see that they didnt even try something new - picking up coins is a chore, its not particulary neccessary but you still kinda want to see what you can unlock, picking coins up stretches the games lenght by a lot and is just tedious - breaking all the stuff breaks immersion a little bit, a character is in danger and you gotta hurry, but instead you search slowly through the level what to break to get all the coins.....it slows down the games action scenes by a lot - coop partners still can hurt each  other.....why?  there is no reason why you could hit each other in these type of games. Especially when you are playing with a younger kid that smashes the punch button to break all the blocks in the level, comboing the partner to death....its not really coop friendly - they approached a new open world feel, but ultimatley I whished they would have gone back to a simple level select screen, its tedious to get to the next location and its not clear where you can buy or unlock new things - the DLCs are terrible! Absolutley cosmetic, but the text makes you belive you get to be a tourist in Jurassic World, but its just a usless skin, the same goes for vehicles, every car feels the same  Overall its a Lego game. Can be fun in coop and looks beautiful. Personally I get tired of the same game with different license, but if you like that definitley get this one too. Its faithful to the movies and universe. A fun ride to enjoy. ",

I had so many fun hours filled with pretty great characters and dinosaurs from all of the 4 films, even SPOILER ALERT: Steven Spielberg and Mr. DNA, from the first film, and the fourth film as a cameo and all 2 of the islands: Isla Nublar, Jurassic Park and Jurassic World variations, and Isla Sorna, The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III variations, all packed in ones huge game.

The first lego game I have played on a keyboard (as I played all the others on the Xbox 360), but configured the buttons to my liking. Though I felt the game was a bit short, finding all the collectables adds onto the amount of playability. I heard there were some glitches in the game, but luckily I played through the whole game without any problems and still haven't found any after completing it (maybe they fixed them?)   One thing I wish would be added in lego games is the ability for online co-op, as I personally think this would be a great feature for friends who own the game and want to play co-op from the comfort of their own homes.  Overall a great game, the humor was good, the dialogue was interesting and the fact they added in audio from the films makes it that bit better, and was a bargain considering I bought it when it was £18.50 on sale. A definite must have for all lego fans! A neat 9.5/10, the .5 being the game feeling a bit short, but a definite must-buy otherwise.  *EDIT* Completed the game to 100% and I only found 1 issue, which was during the bonus level where you chase the gyrosphere as the I-REX, the dino spawned at the end of the level instead of behind the gyrosphere (which is what is supposed to happen). Also for people struggling to find the last gold brick, I found my last one in JP1 in the dilophosauras pen, which there are 3 acid fruits on trees you have to shoot/spit down. For some reason, even before I finally found the brick all the map hubs said I had full bricks on each one so try there first if you are struggling.",

Only things I have to say are bad, and this is extereme nit picking, are the following.   The voices of the main characters are just clips from the movies. So they dont sound as clear or crisp as you would hope.   Also, even though they had to change some scenes to make this game kid friendly (which is understandable) they slightly moved around some scenes. For example, the scene when the kids meet Hammond on the stairs is moved from inside the Centre, to the Raptor cage; which being a big fan of the franchise kinda kinda peeved me off a little.  Ran into a bug where after the T-Rex paddock scene, my game went into a loading screen halfway through the cutscene, while the cutscene was still going, and just stayed like that for awhile; the solution being to get Steam to verify the game cache.   Though I am nit picking EXTREMELY hard; those are the only things wrong I had found.  Definately worth playing if you are a huge fan of th Jurassic Park series, LEGO, a kid or young at heart.",

The first issue came when I couldn't even enter the main menu due to the game not registering any keys or mouse clicks to enter. After ctrl-alt-deleting to exit and then restarting the game, it allowed me to enter. From this point on EVERY one of the dozen or so times I tried to start the game required a failed attempt into a restart to be able to play.   Once I got into the game it was fun, though simplistic. I paused it for a moment, and when I tried to unpause it was frozen again. Restart, play, freeze, restart, play, freeze. I did it on purpose a few times just to see if what I thought was happening was happening: you've got about a 50% chance of the game freezing up on you whenever you pause it. Then it takes two more restarts to get back in. And the cutscenes weren't skipabble either, though this may've been because the game was counting this as my 'first time through' because it didn't autosave. I finally made it to a save point (do games even still have these?) and, just like on the pause menu, it crashed.   Not only this, but nowhere does the game state that it has absolutely NO mouse support. It's a simplistic enough game, but not being able to implement such an easily accessible and vital feature reeks of either laziness or incompetence. It's prety much a direct console port with little to no care put into it.   It was a mistake buying this on release, I really should've waited for a sale a couple months from now, but my excitement really got the better of me. I'm going to be refunding Jurassic World immediately.",

Lego Marvel was lacking a lot of the classic lego slapstick, this has brought it back. Characters do silly things, there are plenty of visual gags to laugh at.  You get to play as dinosaurs (some of them, see cons for an explaination)    Cons: Let's get the big one out of the way, it's glitchy. This is the glitchiest Lego game I've ever played. There are puzzles that require raptors to jump on certain things. I believe there are 5 times you have to do this in the story. Of the 5 times I tried it, 4 had the raptors getting stuck in midair. Waiting about 30 seconds finished the animation and I thankfully didn't have to restart any of the levels, but I was dreading each time I'd have to do the raptor jump to progress the game. I've also had issues with characters getting stuck on objects, compies not being able to get out of tubes, animations glitching out. It's a glitchy game. I personally didn't have any gamebreaking glitches, but the ones I experienced certainly had the potential to be gamebreaking.  The voice acting. This is a problem I've had with every lego game since they started with it in Lego Lord of the Rings. I don't like the voice acting in lego games to begin with, it works much better in games like Lego Star Wars where the stories are told purely visually. Lego Jurassic World is the worst of the worst when it comes to voice acting. Like in the lord of the rings, they decided to use clips of audio taken directly from the movies. I'm not sure if they were aware of this while making hte game, but sound quality in movies from the 1990s wasn't exactly very good. It's even more apparent when there are background npcs that have freshly recorded lines form the 2010s. The difference is instantly noticable, and it's really really badly done.   Strangly anti-death. In a video game series full of comedic violence and cartoonish death scenes, it's strange to see the lego games go so anti-death with Jurassic Park. No one dies in the game. All the people that get eaten don't actually die. They either get tickled by raptors, or if they do get eaten by a T-Rex, they are vomited out by the end, totally unharmed. It's very unusually that they'd be this anti-death with such a death filled movie in a series of games that has never been shy about death. Very strange.  Honestly, it's kind of boring. The other lego games typically had action based characters, Jedi, Super heroes, Indiana Jones, Magic. Characters that get into combat based situations, that have special powers, interesting things like this. Jurassic Park consists of people running away and screaming. Aside from the main characters, no one is really memorable. There are a ton of characters to unlock, and only about 15 that you'll actually know. The unique and cool 'powers' these characters have consist of screaming to break glass, but only sometimes, and that's really about it. All of the other powers have already been explored in other lego games, girls jump higher (which makes no sense but whatever), kids can climb in ducts, people with guns can shoot things, ect.     Lego Jurassic World may well be the first lego game that I have no interest in 100%ing. I've beaten the story and it's honestly too boring to bother getting the minikits, gold bricks, red bricks and unlocking the other characters. The level structure, not to mention the hub world, are so either dull or poorly made that I just don't want to bother.",

We have gotten stuck in certain areas where we could not move the characters and had to start over. It has been very frustrating for my ten year old son who really just wanted the free play mode and the ability to do stuff with the dinosaurs. The fact that you have to solve the whole game to do that is too daunting for him as there are basically no tips or clues for how to get unstuck in PC mode. Yes we have seen walk throughs for each part (mostly with the Xbox) and there aren't really any tips specific to the PC and how to really get the charcters to get through each area. If there were no cheats this would virtually take forever to figure stuff out. Maybe some gamers want that but it was just too frustraing for us.

            "review_text": "TL;DR  Recommend cause: - It's LEGO - It includes all 4 Jurassic Park movies - You do not get (too many) spoilers, so you can even enjoy the movies after playing the game first - Collectibles and Replayability (like any LEGO game :P) - You can play as a Dinosaur xD   Like any LEGO game, I can only recommend it (okay, I admit, I wasn't too pleased with LEGO Marvel Heroes... somehow that game was more of a... drag... than enjoyment, at least for me xD).  Playing through all 4 Jurassic Park movies was pretty awesome and that combined with the typcial LEGO game humor was really fun. Though I found that 5 level per movie cut it a bit short, at first I was a bit disappointed how fast I played through a movie story, but after playing it a 2nd time, I relized it just had the right length.  Also, because of the LEGO humor they add and how the stories are cut, you can experience a basic of the Jurassic Park movies without actually getting too many spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen the movies yet, and watching them will still excite you.  The voice acting from 1-3 sounds like it was directly cut out of the movies and inserted into the game, which was a bit strange at first, but I actually like that.   They fixed some things which annoyed and frustrated me in the other LEGO games, like jumping on a small pillar to reach another point... how often I fell off and had to run up against cause my character just didn't land EXACTLY on the spot which the game wanted you or cause the camera wasn't in a good position.  Now you just have to press the jump button and the character hops from one pillar to the next, making it quite easy (some might say too easy...) but a lot less frustrating.  They added some others things which became frustrating to me at some points - like turning a handle via the analog stick on your controler (not sure what that would be like on keyboard :S). It's just unresponsive at times and even if you're circling your analog stick perfectly, it sometimes dropped the progress and you had to start again... it felt like I had to figure out a pace for each handle in which the analog stick was supposed to be turned. Some handles wanted veeeery slow circles, others you could do normally, that was very annoying.  And like any other LEGO game you have your lil glitches, which can be frustrating, but not game ruining. For example, one worker and some gold bricks were not shown on the map area to collect, in the first HUB (1st Jurassic Park).  I thought the game glitched (like in LEGO LotR) and I had to restart everything to get 100%... which I did and then I came accross that worker in my 2nd playthrough and saw it wasn't displayed on the map. Went back to my old save and look there... he was there, including 2 gold bricks. Got 100% then -.-  But like any other LEGO game from TT Games, you can expect that it will never get a patch and you just gotta live with with. (thanks TT for taking good care of your games after release... maybe something to invest money it from all the DLCs? hmmm)  Anyways, the game is still good and fun and the price okay. I just wish they'd add an online Co-op at one point, cause none of my friends play these games... they even flatout refuse to play them with me, lol",

Some improvements have been made since Marvel. (I haven't played Batman and refuse to play Hobbit since it is unfinished, so I can't really comment on any improvements regarding those titles.) Many stages allow loads of backtracking and in Free Play you can start from any checkpoint, which is HUGE when trying to find those last pesky minikits. Also The Hub is interesting and well thought.   In the end it is basically the same concept as any other lego game. But that is not a bad thing in my book.  Just be aware that people are reporting bugs. In my 100% playthrough I once fell through the world (but respawned quickly after that) and once a character just kept running to a wall and did not respond to the controls.

I know a lot of people who have these problems that own this game.  This is a fun game so far but the game either crashes when you start it up or in game. I highly enjoy this game and i would highly enjoy if the Developers fixed these issues so everyone can move on and enjoy it!",

Pros: - The game looks more polished than previous LEGO games. - Dinosaurs - 100+ LEGO figurines to collect - 20+ cars to unlock - Dinosaurs - Handles the deaths of the characters in a very child friendly way. - LEGO humor EVERYWHERE - Did I say dinosaurs?  Cons - Jump cuts from the movies arn't very fluent - Some users find many bugs, but I did not find any.  This review is pretty half baked, but I would reccomend this to anybody interested to dinosaurs and LEGO games.",

Lego Lord of the Rings and Lego the Hobbit were pushing it, I started getting annoyed at the minikits and gold bricks. Lego Movie, I just want to complete it to see how the story ends. This game? I'm pushing myself for every inch of ground, every level that goes past, just trying to get to the end so I can do free play and explore as whoever I want. It's so aggravating! QTEs that punish you for even a millisecond's hesitation, but mix the buttons up so to pass them you have to pause the game repeatedly - which ruins the animation. Wandering around aimlessly for level after level trying to figure out what it wants you to do, only to find it was that one little thing tucked in a corner. Running and driving away from dinosaurs without the slightest hint of how to avoid getting hit - turns out you have to shoot chickens into their mouths when they roar. Which means you have to switch the second it looks like they're about to roar. I can honestly say I hate lego games right now. I hope the endgame is worth it, because I'm seven hours in, two and a quarter movies down and I don't want to finish the last two. Half an hour in the last week gives you a hint at how much I really don't want to play the poorly designed story missions. And if the end of this is one massive open world where you just constantly run around looking for secrets and amber I'm going to quit Lego games forever.",

You get to relive scenes from the first movie! Besides hitting us in the nostalgia though, I get irked by how the map in this game works. They don't make it clear, in my opinion, where your goal actually is. Compared to the Jurassic World portions of the game, the Jurassic Park portion definitely feels slapped together when your eyes aren't blinded with nostalgia. 3/5 for me.",

For an open world sort of thing its pretty big and full of content, granted its a LOT easier than in the old games. It seems the more games lego pumps out the easier they get, less puzzles more cutscenes. Still got the lego game humor albeit a little TOO much at times. This may be just because I am not a kid anymore but it would be nice to see it a little more serious. Even lego star wars was more serious than this and the jurassic series has giant lizard birds eating people but they censor it too death for kids even though lego star wars had implied decapitations and people getting blown apart or shot to death.",

She was really into SNES and Genesis as a kid all the way until Halo on the original XBox, but since then she sort of backed out of gaming. We are both huge Jurassic Park fans and I thought this would be a fun game to play together. So glad I got it. It's been a while since I have been able to play a game with my wife where we lose track of time and need to make ourselves turn it off.  The game is surprisingly all movies in the franchise. In the begenning you get to play wither Jurassic Park 1 or Jurassic World. After beating JP1, you unlock JP2! Very excited when that happened!   The game plays like most Lego games, and borrows all audio from the movies (at least in the cases of JP1 &amp; JP2) and for a huge JP fan, this is actually a plus. They stick the films rather well and but with a light hearted twist. You'll see what I mean during the 'SHOOT HER!!' scene.  I have no problem buying this at full price. I have nearly every Lego game on steam and wouldn't pay more than 10 for all the others. This is the best Lego game I have played so far.",
