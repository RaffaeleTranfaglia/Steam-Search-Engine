The most similar game I can think of is probably Castlevania 2 on the NES, only better and in a world that feels much bigger. Get it only if you are a true retrogamer and like that kind of gameplay, you aren't going to be disappointed.",

Everything about it says 'good start and then rushed out' which is disappointing, especially for such a high price tag.",
