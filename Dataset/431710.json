These charming games provide just the right level of engagement when you're looking for a relaxing adventure, and want to play something that can be finished in a few hours. I've already started on Episode III, and I will definitely be picking up each installment of the series!",

            "review_text": "This is the second installment of the Space Pilgrim adventure.  It occurs a year after the first chapter.  Some changes have obviously taken place seeing how quite a bit of time has passed.  Some of the characters' past interactions have lead to the blooming of a friendship, and this is depicted in this second chapter of the SP saga.  One of the passengers from back then grew closer to protagonist Gail Pilgrim (the pilot of starship 'Quicksilver' - where most of the scenarios take place in the former chapter).  This friendship blossomed to such an extent that the former passenger now co-manages the starship with Gail. The character in question is also intermittently playable (which allows for a bit of variation &amp; excitement). Meaning, the player is handed control over Gail first &amp; then her friend when the story calls for it.  In this chapter there is yet another handful of passengers on board (and some of these turn out to be allies, and others turn out to be antagonists), as was the case in SP1.  The starship serves as both a passenger &amp; cargo ship (meaning it transports people but also goods). And there's more of an emphasis on the latter in chapter II.  And just like chapter I, the game is divided into 3 main acts, which each focus on a specific issue.  The story now contains elements of one (playable) flashback (which is totally awesome and revolves around a trained individual who was meant to serve as a soldier, but somehow ended up as a fugitive).  How this happened is explained &amp; depicted as you play.  It's interesting to note that the starship still looks the same as before and this chapter feels like a plausible sequel to the former (meaning the story makes sense and does unfold logically).  The dialogue system has been expanded as well (i.e. more questions to ask).  And I appreciate that very much :).  NB: this game contains some brash language &amp; risqu√© jokes at times (you've been warned!)  Trivia:  In the former chapter, there was mention of a particular organization (the J.A.C.) which was only named by it's abbreviated form.  In the second chapter the role of said organization is clarified (i.e. full name is revealed) and further expounded, to such an extent where the subject becomes of great interest to the crew (and story in general).",

            "review_text": "Improves upon the first game, though works well as a stand alone product. The narrative is stronger than the first, with the character development of Sabina and Gail working well. The scattered references to the first game were a nice touch, and once again the humour remains a strong part of the dialouge.  For the price, it's well worth giving it a go. Again, immediately bought the third game following it's completion. Looking forward to see which direction the story heads in.",
