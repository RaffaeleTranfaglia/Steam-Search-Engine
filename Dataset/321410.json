            "review_text": "This game is complex, has a steep learning curve and is a niche game, but if you want to understand the evolution of moden naval warfare - there is no better choice in any form of media. There are lots of online video tutorials to help with the learning curve. It is a virtual naval war college and it is managed by a team that is dedicated to its constant improvement (I've never seen such dedication to supporting any game in my 25 years of playing them). They have improved the game non-stop over the last year, It is insightful, flexible, versatile, and has a database that rivals the most expensive reference books like Combat Fleets or Janes. I served in the USN for 24 years, and I can tell you that this game is priceless for understanding how navies operate and how modern air/naval warfare works. It is the best simulation I have seen in or out of the service - and a useful tool for taxpayers who want to understand where their hard earned money goes. It gives you 65 years of naval warfare across the entire globe with a multitude of realistic and challenging scenarios, and a scenario editor that is relatively easy to use and which has generated an impressive amount of user content. If you have any interest in naval warfare you should buy it - I doubt we will ever see a game this good on naval warfare for the foreseeable future. Hope you give it a try....  Mark",

            "review_text": "I know I have, at this point, only scratched the surface. Or, rather, gently rubbed at the surface, but I wish to state now that I thoroughly reccommend that you buy this game. There is one cabveat though. The price is very high. I admit this and I will say that I got it during the 50% off special sale here on Steam. I have been wanting to get CMANO since it was first released but just could not justify the cost.  Anyway, what is so special? I played a game called Harpoon many years ago. I played each version as it came out. This is the spiritual successor to Harpoon. There are even the same people who were so influencial in Harpoon 2 and 3 working on this version. For example Ragnar Emsoy.   What do you get for your money then? Flashy graphics with amazing 3d models of the ships and aircraft you control? No Great voice acting? No Great big explosions when your weapons hit an airfield? No A game of such depth and interest that it will keep you playing for years? Hell yes!!! A developer who is always looking for new additions to the game? Yes A developer who adds these new additions regularly? Yes A developer who fixes bugs quickly? Yes! Large community who can help you get started? Yes The ability to create your own scenarios? Yes The ability to modify platforms with new weapons? Yes  The maps are basic, but then this is the point of the game. You are controlling groups and platforms from a command centre. you are not looking down on the world seeing Intruders and prowlers flying over mountains. You have NTDS symbols that move across the map following your flight plan.   When creating scenarios you don't just have two sides to play with. Create multiple sides with different postures between various factions. No longer red vs blue. Want red vs blue with green who are neutral to blue but also are unfriendly to red? Easy to set this up.  This is not an easy game. If you want a game that you manually fly your intruder into Hanoi airspace during the Vietnam war, expect to destroy a missile park, (yeah, I've read 'flight of the Intruder' lots!), and fly out again this is not for you. If you want to plan full alpha strikes and set up ingress and egress points yourself with iron hand missions going in first then this is for you. But this is not just a game set in the past. The platforms include the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, not yet in service. There are two databases available for the game, the cold war database and DB3000. This give you the choice of so many platforms with DB3000 giving platforms from 1980 to 2015 onwards. This is so brilliant!!!  Personally I think that I may as well remove most of my other games from my downloads as they will not get played a lot now.   I will stop here as I have been writing this while waiting for my Seawolf to creep around an island looking for 2 Nampo frigates that are there somewhere. :-)",

I purchased the Command, Northern Inferno package to see if it was comparable in realism to Harpoon. It took one scenario to see that it was far more advanced and realistic. I immediately bought the main Command Naval wargame. If you are a naval historian or inthusiest this is a gamers wet dream. Even if you dont play the game, the data base is worth many times the cost of the simulator. James Warships and weapons references are all here for the relevant time envelope. The very best feature in this simulator is that there are no built in rules. outcomes are entirely dependant on your imagination and the platform capabilities. You can develop very advanced tactics with only practical limitations. I can truly recommend this product for serious naval war fans.",

War in the East by Matrix Games in one such game/simulation. DCS World is another. Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations is almost one too. I have to be honest though, when I got it I was pretty much able to get a game going rather quickly thanks to right-click menus and some quick reading of the manual. But to truly master it will take years. Command, or CMANO, is nothing short of an ops room simulation.   Equipped with a database containing a mass of platforms spanning from the 50’s up until the near future is a sandbox within which the player can explore a multitude of historical and speculative scenarios. It is relatively scaled back in terms of visuals and sound, NATO symbology representing the various ships and aircraft in any given scenario, the playground is spread across the globe with audible warnings of hostile weapons releases and the roar of missile launches being the peak of the audio experience. This is a hardcore simulation. A simulation that turns into a sandbox for all those what-if’s or for recreating history. It’s an impressive achievement by the developers. Highly recommended for the Harpoon crowd. ",

            "review_text": "It's really, really good. It's got enough stats to make the nerd in you smile contentedly and enough complexity for real Simmers to enjoy meddling until their hearts content - yet it remains totally accessible to plebs like me, who really would love to know how to play a game like this properly, but haven't the patience to learn it.  Just a few re-runs of the tutorials, then dipping my toe in the Scenarios and I'm already comfortable enough to fly a sortie or two, travel undetected through enemy waters in a Sub or activate a Battle Fleet for full on Naval warfare. I've even been launching Tankers for refuelling and electronic surveillance planes for better Radar. That kind of logistical detail is the stuff I usually get lost with.  The best thing about the game is once you know the interface and the main enablers to get your icons rolling into the sky or out into the sea, the AI does allow for micro managers to step in or out of the action. I'm not a great micro manager so I just oversee them (to make sure the odd unit doesn't go off on it's own doing something weird, which has happened occasionally - turns out that's my dodgy Doctrine settings!). But the beauty is, you can take control at any time if it's a part of the battle you want to get 'on the ground' with.  I love this. The Database alone is worth the money if you like reading technical stats (which I do) but the gameplay, despite the standard UI's attempt to prove otherwise, is fully engaging and absorbing. I hate losing planes or ships to enemy fire and when they go down, you feel it. There's a level and depth of realism you wouldn't expect from symbols on a chart.  10/10 for me - specialist game for sure, but if you do like this kind of sim to begin with, then you'll want for nothing from this package.",

            "review_text": "First, I purchased this game from Matrix. I realize that my review will not count toward Command's overall rating. Steam might think that makes me a fan somehow, but not at all.  Is it a good game?  The bottom line is NO. It's painful to play. Others might have you believe it's complicated and difficult. It's not at all--although looking at a database table or spreadsheet might seem disorienting at first.  This product, however, is simply and poorly designed.  I personally don't care about the windows interface or freely available NASA map (with ugly NATO icons), but simple player tasks are difficult/awkward and the responsiveness overall is choppy. Even simple map panning is awkward. The devs clearly bring the intricacies of the database to the forefront at the expensive of usability and realism.  How could realism suffer in such a 'hardcore' game?  Because it is solely focused on equipment and technology (their beloved database/OOB), so the realism (and fun) of how strategy, operational art, and tactics synchronize is totally missing from the game.  The front end of the game provides no realistic (or intuitive) simulation of the needed tools and controls. The 'mission editor' is about as close as they get, but even that comes off poorly considering other games.  Want to fight a modern Korean War in a theater-level air/sea campaign? You can't.  Want to implement your own Silent Hawk helicopter into a special ops raid scenario? No. You can't touch the locked database without making an approved, licensed, paid, DLC product for them.  Add to that, every single unit in the game acts with the same level of morale, surprise, training, competence, leadership, etc. The devs focus entirely on a tech database which works exclusively to model equipment traits via connected tables.  If 2 Greek F-16 Falcons go up against 2 Turkish F-16 Falcons, the outcome is a roll of the dice.  Want to setup waypoints/steerpoint for your aircraft with timing, altitude and posture settings. How about an ATO with packages and supporting flights? There is nothing like that is in this game. You can only set a reference point(s) on the ground for a unit to move to or to define an area -- in the same way you can in any simple rts. That's nowhere near professional quality planning and control for a sophisticated wargame.  The game actually plays like a really bad rts game; that has terrible mouse and keyboard commands. At this point, rts player control is ubiquitous. The devs could have at least followed the best practices already established by those folks.  Despite a basic 25-year old windows interface, you can't remap a single hotkey. They think they know best for you.  What's the real deal with this game?  As you are fighting the game's controls instead of focused on your opponent, you can be confident that the jumbled icons on the map are meticulously replicating minuscule radar band calculations for you.  To be blunt, I see a group of Harpoon modders who focus almost exclusively on milking the old Harpoon game's database with their changes. Meanwhile, they lock their database version down so that someone else can't do the same thing they did -- without working licensed/paid content through them. Their Inferno and LIVE products are proof of this strategy. Yes, you can hobble together a scenario, but only given strict areas of control and extremely limited scope... a single battle with no external influencers.   When asked by a new player just a few days ago (on the Matrix forum) about modding, Sunburn (listed as a dev) responded with one line only, 'Will you pay for this?'  Interesting and telling response from a group of Harpoon hackers.  For $80 you should expect a lot more from a GAME you plan to play, particularly one that released beta tester created scenarios as paid content. Moments after I purchased the game, I made the mistake of pressing the Campaign button at the top of the opening menu screen. I was greeted with an advertisement to buy some more content. My verbal response to that would violate Steam's terms.   I think these guys are a lot better at business development than game development.",
