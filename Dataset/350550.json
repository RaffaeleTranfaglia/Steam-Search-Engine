            "review_text": "Before getting Area-X, I had heard lots of good reviews on it so I was very happy when I finally got the chance to play it for myself. Without a doubt, it is one of the best visual novels to come out ever. Where do I start?  For those familiar with X-Note, Area-X is the second game in the series. It could be considered either a prequel or sequel, depending on how one looks at the storyline. Basically, you take on the role of Elcia, who is from the Future and has the capability of traveling to different time dimensions via the use of a time machine. Although others do have this ability, Elcia can use it more. I won't go into spoilers as to how since that should be reserved for the true path. ;)  Basically, Elcia travels to different time dimensions originally with the goal of negotiating for natural resources since in the Future, these are lacking. However, events take a turn for the worse...Without giving away spoilers, I won't reveal what they are. Buy the game if you wish to know what happens. XD  There are a total of five guys in the associated time dimensions that you can pursue although at the start, you're only given two of these guys. As you complete paths, you'll be given letters to assemble passwords so you can unlock more paths. Basically, you should play for both good and bad endings to get access to passwords to unlock more paths. Now some might say that this is a bit inconvenient although I can understand the developer's intent. If one were to get access to all of the paths early on, it would be spoiling the story and personally, I prefer to unlock paths as I go so I can learn more of the story. ^^  Aside from the story, the gameplay is pretty standard. There are puzzles to solve and some of them are challenging. In addition, the art is absolutely stunning. I think it's a great improvement from X-Note, and I loved that game. The music is fitting as well and I found myself crying a bit as I got near the end of the true path so yeah, I think this game is beautiful.  Overall, I'd totally recommend getting it and it's interesting to see how elements from X-Note are implemented in Area-X. I'm excited to find out that there will eventually be a sequel although we shouldn't expect it any time soon. Still, I can't wait and again, I recommend getting Area-X, especially if you're a fan of VNs. ^^",
