            "review_text": "Dead Space 2 is amazing. It takes everything the original put into the series, and enhances it. The controls are more precise, smooth and convenient (with the addition of a single button health and stasis refill system), the visuals are even more detailed and gritty, the sound is as creepy as ever, and the story remains intriguing and intense. You must work to unravel the truth behind the Sprawl (the game's setting), Unitology and Necromorphs, as well as battling (literally) horrific hallucinations and delusions from an alien form of dementia. If you are a fan of the first, then you will definitely enjoy this.  While the base game mechanics are not terribly different from many over-the-shoulder style third person shooters, several aspects are worth mentioning. One of the hallmarks of Dead Space 2 is that it forces players to use weapons to defeat enemies in a different way. In a time when headshots are the gold standard for 99% of games, Dead Space 2 requires players to sever limbs in order to defeat enemies--well-placed head shots will get you nowhere. This is a refreshing change of pace, as the dismemberment strategy will change based on enemy type (there are several), and thus every battle becomes much more tactical. There are also a wide variety of unique weapons to choose from, and each weapon will serve a different purpose in your arsenal, depending on how you want to fine tune your Necromorph killing strategy. Puzzles are frequent enough to serve as welcome breaks from the tense action, but not too frequent to become annoying.  Atmosphere was my main draw to DS1 and now DS2. Visceral Games has managed to create this incredibly immersive environment that manages to literally keep me trying to be prepared for what they may throw at me next. In my opinion, the number one contributor to creating such an unrivaled level of atmosphere is the sound design. Anyone who plays this game owes it to themselves to have it on a good home theater system or at least some good quality headphones. The surround sound not only adds to the spookiness of the game, but delivers vital information of approaching creatures. Even in areas with no baddies to kill, the sounds of metallic creaks, cracks and scrapes in the Sprawl's ventilation system let you know you're never safe. Indeed DS2 has some cheap scares, but they're so well timed and not always predictable that I have a hard time believing someone who says they never jumped during a play through.  The music is well composed, and only adds to the atmosphere. The music is also well timed and sometimes gives you the impression that something large is coming. Sometimes it never happens, while other times it does. It manages to build levels of tension and keep you on your toes, never taking for granted the next dark hallway, for a necro is commonly waiting in unseen corners.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Dead Space 2. One does not have to be familiar with the first to enjoy this, as there is a 'Previous on Dead Space' menu option available to bring newcomers up to par; however, to get the most from the story, I would highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Dead Space™ 2 feels and behaves like the first Dead Space™ installment, but adds more monsters and continues with Isaac's story. I must say that I liked this one a little better in some parts, although most of the horror from the first game is gone (some jumpscares here and there but overall the fear element is removed, which is good because nothing can surprise us now after the first time).  The Steam version has all the DLC bundled, and has all the goodies unlocked, so you'll just grab one or two suits along the game and that's it, you won't be too tempted with the schematics. You can disable this though, or just ignore the suits, if you want to have a bigger challenge.  The story is superb and the gameplay is really good. Graphically speaking is the same as many 2010s games, and has a lot of atmosphere, lens flares and all that stuff EA loves.",

Dead Space 2 continues the story of Dead Space 1 except Isac Clark not stranded on a ship anymore he's stranded on a space station instead. Even better he suffers from a form of dementia plaguing his mind and threatens to kill him in the form of his old wife Nicole (Lovely isn't it). New characters are introduced in Dead Space 2 Nolan Stose who suffers from the same syptoms and dementia Isacc does, Tidman who is a complete dumbass, and Ellie who could be a better waifu for Isacc than Nicole. The horror and gameplay in Dead Space 2 has improved and is much better compared to the original with more horror( especially scences where Isac's mind interfers and displays Nicole), more action, and more Oh ♥♥♥♥ moments. There are more suits and more weapons in Dead Space 2 giving players more stuff to experiment and play with. The suits now have special attributes tied to them like 10% more health recieved from health kits and 15% percent more damage with certain weapons. There are even more different kinds of necromorphs to kill and loot from them is obtained by stomping and smashing them (because who dosen't like that). The religous group in Dead Space 1 makes a return here with thier own church on the space station and so does the government with their government sector. Dead Space 2 is a better version of the orignal and is a must own for people who have played Dead Space 1. I do not recommend buying this on its own, instead buy the Dead Space 1 &amp; 2 bundle and experience the best of both worlds.",

            "review_text": "Dead Space 2 is a gigantic, flying leap over Dead Space 1 in many ways.  Pros:      Dozens of gameplay refinements from Dead Space 1: Issac moves much easier and aims much faster, with animations getting almost complete overhaul ( for example, Issac's badass backhand is now replaced with a much faster punch, and his stomp comes out way faster and is much easier to spam). You can now pick up Necromorph blades or rods and shoot them into enemies, allowing you to deal with individual foes much easier and save ammo. New enemy types keep combat fresh, like introducing the long-range debuffing Puker or the agile Stalker to keep the player on their toes. New weapons make for a much more interesting combat experience, with interesting ideas like the Javelin Gun or the Detonator alongside classics like the Plasma Cutter, Line Gun and Pulse Rifle.     Beautiful graphics and sound: The game, while showing it's currently five year old age in a hell of a lot of places (like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM, and long distance objects looking like crap) has some absolutely beautiful locations- standouts include the Government Sector, the Unitologist Church/Residence and more. Lighting effects are at their prime here, with detailed, colourful mood lighting that adds to the setpieces: having the only light be Issac's helmet glow is an effect that REALLY should have been used more often as it simply looks beautiful.     Good Story: Having Issac be voiced is a contentious decision, but I think it works. It helps that his voice acting is pretty good, and the story is much more engaging with him being voiced. Issac being mute in the last game was something I disliked, so it's nice to see him express himself here. The story is much more personal and cinematic this time around, and it has a good resolution at the end.    Replayability: Don't let my 7-ish hours ingame fool you- i've beaten DSII at least 4 times- 3 on PS3 and once on PC and   it's still a blast!  The myriad of weapons, unique combat encounters and wide tools almost demand multiple playthroughs, and the new game plus of this game is on the same tier of Resident Evil 4- just as fun as the first time through, though way easier. My total time with this game has been at least 23 hours total across all the playthroughs, and i've only spent about $20 on this game across buying it twice. It's got a lot of content.   Cons:  Too much action: The unfortunate side of things is that DSII is rarely scary. While DSI wasn't too scary either, it at least tried. DSII is full on action from start to finish, like Alien to Aliens. However, the truly spooky parts, like the first encounter with the stalkers in the church or the appearance of an old pal from DSI towards the end of the game are very memorable. It's a shame that the relentless action kinda ruins the atmosphere, because the creepy atmosphere in many locations can make your skin crawl.    Horrible Install: Despite running very well, the setup process for this game can be a real pain in the ♥♥♥. Seriously, it took me at least half an hour to get it working, and that's with no issues on my end.   Overall: An excellent action horror experience- by cutting off the fluff and refining the core of Dead Space combat, a truly great game was made. A classic everyone should try.",

            "review_text": "After completing it a second time I believe I can fully review this now.  I'll start off by not mentioning the horror, But the story. Coming form Dead space 1 to this the stroy flows through really nicely. Its a great story and like number 1 you find a lot of backstory about whats happening throughout.   The horror. Well In the begining its fantastic. A few nicely put jump scare moments and some really scary mecromorhps get your heart going and you find yourself scouring and survivng the best you can. As a con however near the end the horror looses its edge as it become more action non stop style. But its the end and its expected. The anticipation for the end of the story covers it nicely however and you dont really miss the horror at the end.  The comabt mechanics are spot on. All i can recommend is try using different weapons as much as possible. A lot of people say you will only use the pulse rifle and plasma cutter. But if you buy the other weapons you can have much more fun &amp; they are more effective. Such as the javelin gun (A personal favorite).  Overall Its a 9.5/10 for me.  Highly Recommened.",

The environments were far more varied than they were in the first game's depressing series of hulls &amp; hallways &amp; creaking pipes, w/ nurseries &amp; homes &amp; districts full of stores every which way. The cinematic feel was a lot more developed than the first, &amp; I personally love those touches, where control of the protagonist seemlessly disappears or lessens w/ you hardly noticing as the train ye're on comes to a crash or a Space Helicopter™ springs up out of nowheres poppin' caps in ♥♥♥♥♥es' asses.

            "review_text": "Dead Space 2 is a great horror game and a brilliant sequel to the another great horror game.  Set, I believe, three years after the events of the first game, Isaac Clarke wakes up in a psych ward in a hospital in a space station, just as the infection that wreaked havoc on the Ishimura (space ship) from the first game breaks out on this space station. Clarke makes his escape while having hallucinations but is also guided by a stranger. This is where the story really kicks off. Because I'm going to avoid giving away any spoilers, I'm just going to say that the person you hallucinate throughout the game is Nicole, Isaac's former love interest from the first game.  The brilliance of the horror elements in this game is that it isn't a jump scare type of game. It's genuinely terrifying because of the extent of damage done to this space station due to a breakout in the disease that transforms the people into these abominations of creatures. The most memorable part is, arguably, when you're in a nursery and you see a woman, still alive, trying to cradle her baby, who has visibly transformed. Well, the baby has a yellow, soft belly and if you've played the first game, you'll remember that the yellow areas are weak points prone to explode. You can probably guess what happens to the woman.  The soundtrack is nice but the game really shines when there isn't any music at all. Just the vast void of sound is so profound and the slightest creak will catch you off guard. The sound mixing in this game is done expertly. The graphics are stellar. I mean, I can tell it came out in 2011, but the lighting is so great and the textures on the walls and characters are generally fantastic. All around splendid job on graphics. The level design is done well enough where each chapter has a varied design. I especially loved the zero gravity flying around in space. The vastness of it, and being able to see Saturn in the distance (I'm pretty sure it's Saturn) is just so unique.  Anyway, I feel like I've said enough. Really, fantastic game.

            "review_text": "Dead Space 2 is a great survival horror experience that I feel like I should recommend to my gamer friends, but why do I say so?  First of all, it's a survival horror, which is quite a rare genre these days, but that doesn't influence my recommendation, I am merely stating this fact for you to keep in mind if you were searching something like this.  I finished the game in roughly 14 hours or so, with a good pace, exploring everything and playing at the survivalist difficulty, which is one grade higher than normal, as I saw in the forums, it is the best difficulty for someone wanting a challenge, instead of the highest which is zealot and is recommended for new game+.  The challenge was good, I was tense most of the time, never mind the jump scares, the ammo was pretty scarce and the enemies needed only two or three hits to take you down, and all this considering careful ammo and inventory management. I did end up with a surplus of health kits that I saved in my safe and sold all the stasis packs, but the ammo, I had to buy some of those. The gameplay is smoother from the first Dead Space, the character controls well and behaves like he should, which means you're not agile but you're not clunky either, it is a fine balance, although sometimes I wish I could roll out of the way I admit (which is not possible for the record). The horror part and the environment were pretty well done, I never did scream or anything, it wasn't that terrifying, but I was tense most of the time and the occasional 'F*ck' did come out of my mouth when confronted with jump scares or close encounters with numerous enemies. Which reminds me, most of the time I was collected and my aim was good, but the game did drive me in some corners where I panicked, which is definitely a plus in this genre. The only reasons I would not recommend this game are mainly two design flaws : 1.) No more than two bodies stay in the room, at the third body, the latest despawns, but what does this mean? It means that you need to stomp or otherwise damage enemies on the floor to get your drop (ammo, health, credits) and when the enemy despawns, so does the loot. Annoying to say the least. 2.) Death is mostly harmless with no repercussions to the player, hell it is even advantageous at some points. When you die, you get back at the checkpoint, so if you had full health at a check point and, for example, fell into a stupid trap that reduced your health to red, you can just die and retry again with full health again and no other penalty (Of course this doesn't apply to hard core mode, a mode you unlock when you finish the game that allows only 3 saves and forces you to reload when you die). Lastly I would like to talk about about the story in a short paragraph. The story continues from the first Dead Space of course, which I recommend to play too, but don't feel compelled to, everything is explained rather well I think. It's a good story, it has it's own charms, maybe a plot hole? Not sure. The good thing is I was genuinely surprised, not once but twice! The twist and turns were well done, it's not like I was looking forward to it, but it's definitely a plus when it's not reduced to a clichè and I didn't know what to expect.  I think I covered everything, the graphics were good, the music almost non-existant, the multiplayer was pretty fun and original, but anyways it's a pretty cool survival horror, those who like the genre should definitely play it, besides, you'll probably get it for spare change like me during sales, I think I paid 2 euros or something, definitely worth it.",

Isaac's inner struggle in the tense setting of 'Sprawl' provides an unforgettable atomsphere, making Dead Space 2 one of the most terrifying and unmissable horror games this generation and the benchmark for others to follow.Dead Space 2 is a more than worthy successor to the original, adding plenty of oomph to the series and a solid multiplayer experience to boot. We would have preferred more puzzles and a little less linearity, but that doesn't stop us wanting a third Isaac outing.",

Well, from the VERY BEGINNING of the game, you have access to many different weapons (and I think even armor suits) that you normally would not. Not to mention, it's all completely free.  Now, this is just me, but personally, I do not like having all this extra crap available to me because it really hurts the whole 'resource management' aspect of the game. And the survival horror aspect in general. The game is simply easier with the ability to get all of these different guns for free.  At least at one point, there was a means (albeit convoluted) of removing the DLC from the game, but it meant reverting to a previous version of the game with less updates/patches. I think that's just stupid. You should be able to disable the DLC prior to starting a new campaign game.  But despite that, this game still gets a 'thumbs up' because it's just that good. A great sequel to the first.",

I was always on the edge of my seat determined to get through as many chapters as possible in DS2. There were more interesting things in DS2 game than the typical cliche, predictable jump scares from DS1. Dead Space 2 added more life to the necromorphs and made them even more insanely disturbing than just alien zombies. Necromorphs are after all the basis of the Dead Space series. DS2 is when they turned from being random zombies to being very interesting, I begun to see all of their habits, predatory strategies and beyond. Another major difference I felt between the two games was how I felt unstoppable with my guns in DS1 and how I felt everything was turning out to a repetitive shooting gallery. I never felt the same way in DS2 since the the necromorphs were pretty powerful and aggressive even to the end of the game; I never felt overpowered, and always in danger.     In all, DS1 was a glorifed shoot zombies on spaceship game with spooky halls. You would face pretty much the same type of necromorphs, tactics and predictable, 'oh, ♥♥♥♥, someone got lazy and the ishimarua isn't working again-hold on for 30 minutes while you get swarmed by zombies and have to burn up all your ammo.' Now granted DS2 does have some of that very same action in comparison to DS1 there is more variety with the game. There are things like the tormentor, ubermorph, exploding door panels, the segment with the train, nolan stross, fleeing civilians, and tideman to ♥♥♥♥ up everything in your way forcing you to do things like repairing solar panels; all of these components make DS2 not seem as boring as DS1, and keep you interested in the 'background'. These things are all CONSTANT and remind you that your threat is not ONLY the necromorphs and brings you a sense the environment is alive.    This is a better game than DS2 and 1,3. After DS2 is when Dead Space started go downhill.",

With the eeire atmosphere of the Sprawl being conveyed brilliantly in conjunction with the stellar audio presentation to make the Sprawl a consistantly engaging setting. There are issues with the game certainly, such as the over-reliance on cheap jump scares rather than building its horror to truely terrify the player. Also the story could have been so much more with Issac barely given a personality other than 'Bland everyman' and the human antagonist is barely seen only having 2-3 scenes in the whole game before the final encounter.

The gameplay is largely unchanged, but retains all of the great qualities of its predecessor, dismembering old and new alien-varieties feels as satisfying and brutal as ever. It starts off really well with some interesting surroundings on Titan Station and some tense moments, but towards the end devolves into a mindless shooting gallery that pits you against never ending waves of enemies. The flashback-sequences are mostly well-done and pretty interesting as it gives you more insight into Isaac's personality and history, but the rest of the story and dialogue is painfully average and rather forgettable. Isaac also has a voice now, though it turns out he's just a generic action-hero after all.  The horror elements sometimes build some tension, but more often than not the ubiquitous jumpscares and laughably animated bodies being pulled into vents are either more funny than scary or just plain annoying because they happen over and over again. Coupled with the fact that the story is performed so straight-faced the unintentionally funny scares stick out like a sore thumb. However, some of the new alien designs are very cool to look at and manage to be frightening without just being amorphous piles of decaying flesh.  Generally I found it a bit underwhelming since it doesn't feel as fresh as Dead Space 1 was yet it doesn't distance itself very much from it either, mostly sticking to the tried and true methods of the first game and polishing them up a little. The last few chapters also felt very padded with a flood of enemies and almost non-stop shooting, which I felt pushed the game a bit too far into run-and-gun-territory. But underneath it all it's still a very competent game that delivers more Dead Space, so if that's what you're after, you probably won't be disappointed.",

I tell you this actually...i'm glad that Isaac Clarke (the protagonist of the game) was given a voice this time, cos he was mute in the first one. It's weird because they make the character mute usually so it will feel more immersive for the player, except it has the opposite effect on me, for example when the npc's talk to your character and he just blanks them it's annoying! like in half life 2 they actually have Alyx say ' the quiet type huh' after Gordon doesn't respond.   There are a few new monsters in this that weren't in the first like these raptoresque ones that hide behind crates and then charge at you. They only appear in rooms with big crates in them, so that's a bit formulaic, i mean it detracts from scariness if you know what the monster will be when you enter a room just by the way it's set out. Oh also that motherf*cking unkillable one that regenerates is back but only appears at the end so it's not too bad. I hate that one, it's cheap having an unkillable enemy, it's not scary but frustrating, stop it!.  I preferred the ending to the first game more than this when you go down to the planet on that one, but without spoiling it i did like how the very ending of this one has a nice well not twist but like... play on how the first one ended, made me smile anyway.",

            "review_text": "Originally posted Feb 4 2011  gameaday-ish.blogspot.com   Many, many games make me wish for a “sigh” button, for a variety of reasons. Dead Space 2 makes me wish for a “sigh of despair” button.  Thrown into a startling and thrilling opening sequence, Isaac Clarke returns from Dead Space to once again dismember and destroy necromorphs. Arming himself in a plot-driven and organic way, Isaac also finds his voice, something that was missing in the first game. Spectacularly well written and well-acted, Isaac is no longer a silent avatar for the player, but a fully formed character whose destiny is to be plagued by waking nightmares.  Like a futuristic John Mclane, Isaac finds himself in a horribly familiar situation: running and fighting for his life through an industrial space maze, guided by remote voices. Unlike the errand missions and unending jump scares of the first game, DS 2 makes ironic meat of the first game’s formula with a half-way point reveal that is delicious. Replete with actual mood and atmosphere, DS 2 does have more than its fair share of jump scares, but makes up for it by honing tension to a bright gleaming point.  A few mid-to-late game set pieces tread dangerously close to vomiting all over the concept of over-the-top bad taste, but like any great horror experience makes the viewer squirm.   Caveats are few and far between, but like the overuse of jump-scares, DS 2 does milk its formula too much. Vacillating between random encounters against one or two enemies and endless swarms, DS 2 also swings heavily in difficulty level, especially in the late game. Combat and movement have been tweaked just enough to make the action quick and responsive, unlike the tank controls of the first game. While this makes the game move faster and become slightly more of an action-shooter, it makes the difficulty spikes more egregious as the need for accuracy ramps up beyond the speed of the controls.  Following the first game, DS 2 allows for a New Game+ mode, allowing the player to carry over any upgraded equipment from the 1st playthough, lowering the difficulty and increasing replayibility.   Satisfying in its resolution, DS 2 raises the bar beyond survival horror to become a truly cinematic horror experience and I can’t wait to play it again.  ",

Dead Space 2 continues the first game's story.Let me also first say,that this game is amazing.I bought it back in 2012,february (1 year after it's initial release) because i upgraded my pc and thought i should give it a go.DAmn,the game was well optimised.Not a single time,i experienced issues.None of them.And my PC was not a beast at that time,but the game worked perfectly on medium 1024x768 (i rarely play on high resolutions old habit because of goldsrc games like Half-Life 1,Counter-Strike 1.6 etc.). In this new installment some big changes have been introduced and they are all welcome in my opinion except one which i will say by the end of the review (haha). Firstly,Isaac Clarke now has a personality.He talks now.He doesn't feel like a puppet in the first game.And boy is he a true badasssss.Like for real...Really welcomed that.Gunner Wright (actor who portrayed Isaac both physically and by voice) did an outsanding job,and not only him,like everybody involved in that department.Top notch. We also got introduced by some new weapons,although not by to many since it would kinda...it's just...to many weapons i don't think belong to a Dead Space game (Well,they scruwed that up in the third game.JEsus Christ.).They work really good and are nice and satisfying to use. (Good Javelin Gun :D) We also got introduced to new enemies which is very well done.They tried to kinda make something new but stay true to the first game and to not shift to dramatically which is awesome considering it is made by EA. Atmosphere.Yes,it got changed.It has less horror than in the first game, but it still has spooky moments.This is more a...thriller...'psychological' thriller,since we learn that Isaac has dementia.It is a bit philosophical and requires you to think a bit about it in order to understand the horror Isaac goes through.Like a badaaasssss. Soundtrack or should i say the orchestra is very well executed,like they made compositions for a movie,top quality indeed. Now,the only thing i didn't like.They changed how the laser for the guns works compared to the first game which is a shame (Dead Space fans know what i talk about).It is not that you should worry to much about it. So...if i had to compare Dead Space 1 to Dead Space 2 i will just say this: Dead Space 1 is like Alien 1 movie. Dead Space 2 is like Aliens (Second movie in alien franchise). There you go.I'm serious.That is how i see it.And yes i am a huge fan of both games...and i like the second one a bit more,because did i mention that Isaac is a true badaaassss? :D :D :D IT also has multipayer which is ok,but it is primarely a singleplayer focused game,so you can give multiplayer a try but it was more oriented for console players if you ask me...which is not a huge bad thing,but i don't think that the player base is populated as before...but you can expect your first game against high level oponnents...which is...hard. In the end,Dead Space 2 is a sequel done right.There is no excuse that if you own a PC to not give a try this game.It is the last good game made by EA before EA went totally nuts.Amazing game.Definetely will remember it for a long time. Thank you for reading my review.  ",

At this point it feels as if they're intentionally holding pieces of the story out for other media [Comics or movies] in order to milk more money out of this.   In a confusing turn, they gave you the ability to buy multiple suits and variatons on weapons, which felt like they artifically padded out the list of useless weapons [Can beat the game fine with just Plasma Cutter, I've done it with both games] and suits so they could use them for a bullet point on the back of the box.  tl;dr - kind of fun to play, completely fails in every way as a horror and/or story driven game.

I remember the turret segments, which should have been awesome, were ruined by the atrocious controls, and I remember the two other people with Isaac being unlikeable jackasses. I haven't played Dead Space 3, and I really don't want to. Now, Dead Space 2 takes a cue from Empire Strikes Back and attempts to be better than the first game, which it manages to both succeed and fail at. The Sprawl is a great location to play through, being far more spacious and varied than the Ishimura, and we get a few glimpses of everyday life on the Sprawl. Isaac himself actually has characterization this time, albeit fairly clichéd, and most of the characters we interact with have different and compelling personalities, especially newcomer Ellie. Ellie and Isaac play off one another in ways that are both hilarious and heartbreaking, and it overall makes for better immersion.  Unfortunately, that's all I have to say that's positive. The biggest, most glaring problem is: this game is basically Dead Space 1 with a new paint job and a camper attached. Most of the enemies are copy-pasted from the first game, including the 'elite' recolors, gameplay is identical, the plot amounts to 'Dead Space 1, but on a space station,' the wide array of weapons is, again, completely pointless since the plasma cutter is all you really need, Isaac is lead along by a female character who betrays him in sight of the oh-so-special Marker, (two this time!), and the monsters keep jumping out of the exact same 'vent' (it doesn't actually go anywhere) as the first game. Oh, but wait! Now, there's extra varieties of incredibly obvious panels the monsters could be behind! Yahoo!  Now, onto the series' bread and butter; the gore and body horror. They're there and they're certainly creative, but they start losing what edge they might have had when they're in your face (literally) from the start of the game right up to the end. Much of the game's gore allowance was lavishly slapped onto Isaac's numerous death scenes...which you'll likely never see if you play at all competently.  In conclusion, Dead Space 1 is boring, Dead Space 2 is better but still boring, and Dead Space 3 doesn't look like it's worth the money spent.",

After all, that Marker is quite the mastermind coveted artifact of the franchise isn't?  What can I say about DS2...  Well, it is fairly longer than DS1, has 15 chapters total. I had previously played the game a few times already on the PlayStation 3 (didn't Platinum the game as the Hard Core mode is a real ♥♥♥♥♥!) and this was my first playthrough on the PC. I can honestly say that my overall experience was much better on PC as the controls (MOUSE + KEYBOARD) are very tight in this game. The aiming is topnotch while on the PS3, it was wonky.  I really liked that game and maybe even a bit more than DS1. Fantastic sequel with new RIGs and weapons, it is an outstanding sequel.  PROS: -For a console port, I'd say the graphical PC options are great (but no DX11 great though). -WORKING PORT! I haven't experienced any gamebreaking bugs like invisible walls nor V-Sync issues. The game works superb! (Probably that is got patched along the way though!). -Excellent atmosphere, sounds. -Isaac Clarke speaks! -Interesting Zero-G mechanic used in levels. -Scary new Necromorphs monsters. -Excellent pacing and intense action. -Impressive presentation and visuals. -New emotional depth (Isaac's went to the coocoo's nest!).  CONS: -Multiplayer modes IS tacked on and really unnecessary. -AI can be a little cheap at times. (Enemies spawning all around you and all run at you... which one to pick first as the others will hit you?) -Running back and forth to a Save Station and the Store booths is annoying.  Loved Dead Space 1? GET THIS SEQUEL! Haven't played any Dead Space yet and you dig sci-fi / horror games? What are you waiting for??? GET 'EM NOW! (when their on deals that is!).

I have thoroughly enjoyed every second of this game, from the intro sequence to the runthrough of hardcore mode. There were no limbs left unsevered, no body left unstomped, and most of all, no room left unlooted! If you're a fan of action-survival horror, this is certainly the way to go, with it incorporating a fluid fighting system, a properly chilling atmosphere, and a spectacular story to boot! In short, Dead Space 2 has been the greatest highlight of my venture into the horror genre, and any fan of the horror feel would be remiss to not give this a try.",

You're got used to things getting jacked up to 11 while running through the corridors of the Ishimura. You're wrong. Because for the entirety of your life, you misunderstood how numbers work. What you thought was an eleven was actually a three. Dead Space 2? It teaches you about 11. You'll understand it all too well, before the end.  Continuing after the first installment, Dead Space 2 is a loveable mixture of Silent Hill and Mass Effect. To call it a third person 'corridor shooter' would do it an injustice, as the dev team did an excellent job of making the environments feel lived in and plausible. When you stop to reflect on the sheer amount of locales present in the sequel--mental wards, shopping malls, apartment complexes and mining facilities (to name a few)--you could be forgiven for thinking that Dead Space 2 is a long, hard grind. Except that it doesn't feel that way. You're fighting for your life--frequently running away, screaming--and you never have enough ammunition, health, or power nodes.  As an added bonus for purchasing the game on Steam, you'll have access to every weapon and most sets of armor as soon as you have access to your first in-game store kiosk. Even better, these items are free of charge, allowing you to save your money on upgrades, extra fuel for your flamethrower, and precious, precious medical attention. The action is considerably more fluid this time around, the pacing is excellent, there are memorable characters trying to survive alongside you and --  . . .  The light bulb across the room burnt out. Logically, I know it has nothing whatsoever to do with a marker (or necromorphs). And yet, I had to stop myself to formulate that sentence--such is the grip of Dead Space 2. You feel present in this nightmare vision of humanity's future that you are honestly jumpy when an incandescent bulb near you radiates its last lumens.  The replacement bulb is downstairs.  That's a long way in the dark.",

Graphics and level design has gotten a huge facelift. Massive details and larges levels to explore.  One thing I have to mention is that medium difficulty will give you a bit of a challenge. Unlike DS1 medium difficulty felt like veryt easy difficulty. DS2 medium difficulty feels just right or half way to hard. The AI is amazing and well scripted. You WILL die.

Knowing that I can gun down any enemy at any moment while taking minimal damage just takes away from what made Dead Space such a great game. In the original I was scared to turn every corner and was constantly turning around to check for enemies. In DS2 I can just run around shooting things as they pop out without worrying about it too much.  The mechanics of this one work the same as the original, which didn't need to be changed anyways. The old weapons are so good that you won't even use the new ones. The only difference is a continued story(which is awesome) and more enemies.

Like the previous game, the setting is dark and scary, and the enemies must be dismembered to kill them.  Pros: Unlike the previous game, the balance feels really good to me. You still have to manage your resources carefully, but it never slows down the action. The enviroment and atmosphere are top notch. Like before the game menus are done in-game and in real time never breaking your immersion. There are some really good scripted sequences in this one and new enemies to fight. There seems to be even more ways Isaac can die in this game and dying can actually be quite fun to watch. The story is done really well. There are some characters you really will feel for as the game progresses.  Cons: The only big con I have with this game is that it is too short. I was having so much fun playing the game that I wished there was more. You can beat the game in about 12 to 16 hours or less if you play on an easier difficulty. There was one area that needed a little balance as it was a lot harder than the rest of the game. This, however, is a minor issue and wasn't game breaking.  Conclusion: If you liked the first game, you will love this. This game is a better more polished experience than the first. If you're looking for a great survival horror game to play I highly recommend this one.  Score: 9.6 / 10",

In DS1 Isaac never spoke, it made it feel like the NPC's were talking directly to you, the player, it put you fully in his shoes, YOU were the character. For me that was what made the original Dead Space so immersive and so f***ing terrifying - that and the horrifying man in the wall monsters.  They threw that out of the window in this one by having Isaac talk, sure it makes sense from a story point of view but it takes you out of his shoes and completely detaches you, makes you an outsider looking in, like any other game.  That gripe aside this is still an awesome game, graphically a lot better than the first, hacking up necromorphs and impaling them with their own limbs is still as satisfyingly gruesome, and the stomping has been improved, now instead of one thud at a time you can keep on mashing that stomp until Isaac gets all angry and swears at the gloopy corpse under his feet. Another big improvement over the first is the zero G sections, where in the first game you'd have to slowly jump from point to point, in DS2 you now have full 360 degree flight with reaction thrusters on your suit, and this has been incorporated into some great puzzles involving the stasis module, pipes and fans.  It still has its spooky moments and unexpected googlieman surprises but they lack the impact of the first game, and after an hour of playing you'll be completely desensitized to it. Well most of it, that man in the wall monster is back in this one too and he is still f***ing terrifying.  Absolutely worth the buy.",

The story was solid, with characters you liked,hated and rooted for only later to loathe them for their actions. A direct continuation from the first, this builds further on the franchise deepening the plot and bringing it to an amazing head. The atmosphere was completely immersive and, kept you hooked with its gorgeous use of graphical fidelity. Couldn't help but feeling creeped out and sometimes just waiting for something to jump out at me from every turn at times, which happens just enough to make you cautious to borderline paranoid. As a hardcore fan of early resident evil games, it is good to see another franchise that completely captures the survival horror genre and nails it in aces.",

This simple mechanic thanks to kinesis from the original brings a little spice in combat - something that, if I were to be really nitpicky about, grew slightly tedious as DS 1 progressed. My final comment is that I have not encountered any possibly game-breaking bugs like I had with the predecessor. I did not need to tinker around my in-game settings or graphics control panel to alleviate something that should not have posed as a problem in the first place.

The story is consistanly good as well, with afew great twists and turns. The horror is used fantastically! Narrow corridors give you a sense of inevitable doom and terror, as you are always a hair away from danger. Gameplay is satisfying as weapons seem powerful while blowing away necromorphs. The only downside I could give this game is the online aspect. Its goes for the Left 4 Dead Versus formula, but doesn't really pull it off well.

Enemy designs are also worth a mention, since the Necromorph (alien/ human hybrids) are all creepy and haunting, to say the least. Not to mention, there are a lot of varying enemy types to fight against, each requiring different ways to cleanly kill them to preserve ammo and slow them down. Just like Dead Space 1, dismemberment is crucial to progression in harder difficulties, since you need to learn how to quickly kill certain enemies before they rip you apart.  The story is interesting, but without going into spoiler region, I can safely say it's quite forgetable ina lot of parts, but is strong with it's backstory. I always wanted to listen to audiologs or read articles about the lore, since it differs greatly from other horror games, adding a sci fi mix to the genre. It's best you make your own decision, but I mainly played for the experience.  There is a large amount of upgrades to acquire, as well as weapons that can be upgraded. Multiple playthroughs are to be expected to futher strengthen your arsenal and character (Isaac Clarke). Overall, this game is a lot of fun (when it works) and is definitely worth a play.
