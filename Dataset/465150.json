            "review_text": "I bought this game because of my intrests in astronomy. It met some of my expectations but there are few things that could be improved. I like the game mechanics but it feels like a game made for children. There is no proper excitment. The most fun part about it was (spoilers) driving the tiny rover. It ended too quickly for me but I like the fact that you can travel to previous visited places. I don't think it's fully ready yet so I will not recommend this. I'm sorry to say this, but it does have some potential. I'm gonna keep it for the time being and let's see where this goes.",
