Obviously this is a straight port from the arcade to Steam. But I'm not complaining. It's still addicting as heck. Who could not enjoy gobbling up Pac-Dots, Fruits, and the main course, the Ghosts.  Even if you're not born from the 80's, you can discover the true origins of how Pac-Man became a classic hit just by playing the game.",

(Need to Alt+F4 or end process) -No key mapping -No Fullscreen option (have to use Alt+Enter) -No 360 arcade stick support (Mad Catz stick vetical axis is flipped, PS3 one works perfectly) -Analog Stick deadzone is awful, often moves left while entering no input -Needlessly massive downloads for such small games (800mb+)  Game's themselves are fine, but these shells they are in are atrocious. Some very basic functions have been missed and basic input support has not been offered. Unless these aren't fixed quickly, then I would suggest avoiding these or getting a refund if you have already purchased them.",
