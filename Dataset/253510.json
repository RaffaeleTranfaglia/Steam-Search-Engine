            "review_text": "Tl;dr If you like turn-based games, have the patience to get into the game and it is OK for you to overlook a number of flaws, then you should try this rather unique game.  Longer version: Overall, this game is hard to rate and I certainly would not recommend it to everyone as it has several issues: - The game was released too early. This resulted in lots of bad reviews and is the reason for a second major problem: lack of players. - as very few people seem to be playing the game, it‘s really hard to find an opponent in multiplayer. Out of the 80 h of time Steam says I spent with this game, probably 20 h I was waiting for a game.  - not only the waiting time for a game is really long, but a match (at least at 50 pts. level) is a serious time commitment. This also applies for singleplayer: you cannot save during campaign battles, if you do not have the time to finish a level, you need to start over.  - the AI is really bad - not really a downside, but the game has a steep learning curve (including getting used to a rather clunky interface) and the AI is not helpful in improving.  Still I think this is a good game and has lots of potential. - actually I liked the single player campaign. I am not sure what people expect from a Kickstarter game regarding cut scenes (a complaint in many reviews), but I think they worked quite well in telling the story. While the story is certainly not extraordinary, it kept me playing from one level to the next and I really liked the diversity of the maps. As the enemies in the individual levels are scripted, the dumb AI is not that much of an issue. - Overall, I think this game is quite unique in bringing a tabletop game to the PC. It may be described as a mash-up of XCOM (turn-based tactics elements), Bloodbowl (positioning your units; not to hide the ball, but your warcaster), and Warhammer (regarding colorful fantasy setting; I have to admit I did not know Warmachine before). Even though the developers are relatively slow in improving the game, they have been committed to making it better for quite some time and I think they improved it already quite a bit. Overall, I think this game is a solid 7.5/10 with lots of potential.",

            "review_text": "Warmachine Tactics has a lot going for it, and a lot holding it back.  First, the negative: production values are inconsistent. A lot of still portraits, and in many cases, still models in cutscenes whose mouth's don't move while they talk. Various UI glitches that may force you to skip unit activations. Scripted events throughout the campaign make it less about tactics, and more about just getting through the mission. No saving mid-level (this means if you don't have at least an hour or so each mission, you are likely to lose a lot of progress if you have to stop playing).  Despite all of that, there are a lot of good things about Warmachine Tactics. A unique world, setting and units based on the award winning tabletop game: WARMACHINE. The rules and interactions are very deep with many different things to consider throughout a match. There is an unlimited amount of replayability as unit selection and opponent choices make it so no two matches are exactly alike.  If you are willing to look past various annoyances in the production of the game, this title has a lot of excellent tactical wargaming to be had. Anyone who is a fan of grid-based strategy games would be remiss to not give this game a chance.  7/10 'Good'",

            "review_text": "I only Played the Demo so I don't really know much more about this game. I'll start with some of the things I liked before I get into any of the bad things.   1. The character artwork is great! I saw images of some of the mechs on zbrush central and I started looking for this game right away.   2.Controlling and allocating focus to warjacks was an interesting take on a turn based tactical game like this.  3. I enjoyed the combat and gameplay mechanics. There are many games with these mechanics but the theme was very interesting and exciting for me.  Now I'll go into some of the things that i don't like and again please understand that I only played the demo so my experience is only limited to the 3 missions in the demo.  1. The camera is messed up in the city levels. Every time I would do an attack the camera would start rotating or something around the two characters fighting and the camera would go behind the wall and I would not see the attack or how much damage i did or if i missed.  2. The dialgue was really lame. and to top it off the characters apear to not have any facial rigs. When your in a cutscene with two characters talking the mouths don't move and the camera moves around like its supposed to be a movie or something. I feel they should have gone to text because it threw me off so much that their mouths were not moving. It made it look like some college students last minute project where they had a scene and characters and only had to deal with camera angles. It was so annoying because the camera would even cut to the person talking but all that was happening was the audio but nothing else. I don't know maybe its just a thing that gets on my nerves personally. it doesn't change the outcome of the game in the end so i guess it doesn't matter.  I don't want to put a recommendation out because I haven't played the full game. I will however say that I will not buy this game enless its like 10 dollars. I am interested and I want to play the rest of the game, but based on some of the issues I pointed out i feel it was slapped together at some points and the Camera issues I had in the city level were unbearable. I can't wait till i goes on sale though I really want to see the rest of the Warjacks and character art. ",

It may take a few games for someone completely new to the setting to get used to but there are very comprehensive tutorials so it shouldn't take anyone long.   For the rest I like the single player campaign. I think that the story is well narrated and enjoyable. Yes there are a few areas that need more work but for the rest there is nothing broken that makes the game unplayable.  Game-play is easy to understand, good graphics on both units and environment, nice combat and spell animations.  Multiplayer is where this game truly shines not just because of the things I mentioned above but also because of the really great community playing it.   Lastly, I am really happy with the close interaction between the community and the developers. WMD is very active on the forums and truly listen to players advice which is awesome.",

            "review_text": "Okay, to start with, I'll point out that there was a very small review (archived at the bottom of this one) that was essentially a complaint about how the game lacks a save system. Well, less than a week later the Dev's implimented a save function to single player. Clearly they read the old review and terrified by the thought of annoying me as they had, they fixed it as soon as they could. (I don't actually mean that. That was a joke.)  Oh, and I'll also mention I've never tried the multiplayer mode, so I can't comment on how popular it is or how easy it is to get pick up matches or suchlike. If that's your thing you'll probably want to check the discussion forums for that.  Right, so.... actual review time now. Where to start? Well, the game looks rather spectacular. They went all out on the graphics, that much is obvious. Everything looks nice and crisp and all the animations move smoothly. More often than not when a game developed like this puts that much focus on graphics it tends to suffer in other areas like performance, but I can't say that's true here. When I bought this my PC was chugging along with an absolutely shameful amount of RAM that meant that most toasters had more processing power than it did, and there was no lag in combat or movement. The closest things I can think of that some people might consider to be issues here are the cutscenes, which are voiced but not animated (You get still images of the people involved in dramatic poses while the lines are spoken) and the way corpses can pile up - if you kill enough people in one small area the bodies tend to stack up and get a bit weirdly floppy and wave limbs wildly and suchlike. Neither thing is an actual game breaking issues though, just something people might not like.  TL;DR: Graphics good and shiny nice.  What next? Gameplay. Well, the UI can be a touch fiddly in a few cases - if a unit gets extra movement, say from a skill that lets it shuffle about a bit after killing someone you need to actually click on the YES I'M DONE WITH THIS UNIT button which caught me out a few times and made me think the game had broken the first time it happened, but once you get used to it it certainly isn't the worst UI I've ever dealt with.  There's a thing called confirmation bias, where people have a tendency to only remember the things they want to be able to use as proof of something, so take this bit with a grain of salt, but I suspect the RNG is stacked in the AI's favour - I definately think I've missed more hits than I should have, and damage rolls have consistently been on the low end. That might just be me though, or it might be a hidden behind the scenes thing to give some much needed help to the AI. The enemy AI isn't amazing. It's functional, but it will never end up giving you one of those stories you can talk about where it did something totally unexpected and wrecked you with a flank attack or something. It's all 'hail diddle diddle, straight down the middle'.   TL;DR: UI slightly fiddly, AI Functional, not amazing.   Ultimately there's a fairly solid little middle of the road game here. It isn't incredible and it wont blow your mind, but what is here isn't bad - they could have scraped together some crappy mobile game and paid a Korean coding sweatshop to port it over later or hired some random developer to vomit up something for whatever number the xbox or playstation is up to this month, but they didn't, they got someone to put together a nice little PC game that is still being patched and worked on regularly, and that should count for something.  All told I'm going to have to quietly change my recommendation to a yes.  Oh, and Glory to Khador! Glory to the motherland!                     Ye Olde Reviewe:  The game doesn't have a save function. It's 2016 and there's a game here without the ability to record your progress. I kinda feel like the explorers in those old 'Lost Valley of the Dinosaurs' type movies. I've found something that should have stopped existing long, long, long ago.",

            "review_text": "This is probably the most effectively done video game version of a miniature tabletop wargame I have ever seen.  Miniature tabletop wargames have grown in popularity over the years. Miniature tabletop wargames are games in which players can assemble and paint real life, scale miniature figures representing soldiers, creatures and vehicles of war and conduct army battles with them. The best known example of this genre is probably Warhammer 40K. Warmachine is a rising competitor to 40K, based upon warfare set in a steampunk fantasy world.   For many people the time and cost involved provides a significant barrier to entry to the genre. Warmachine: Tactics represents a well executed video game realization of the miniature tabletop wargame on your computer, bypassing many of these difficulties.  It will be interesting to see how this game develops as additional factions and campaigns are added in the future. Hopefully this will also act as an effective springboard for people who want to give the real life game a try!",

            "review_text": "First off, DO NOT pay $40 for this game. Given its current state, it still feels like a Beta version.  That said, the gameplay is actually fun, and the story is pretty good. It's a decent digital version of the tabletop game. It's not an exact port, but the changes work quite well for a video game format.  The major problems with the game are technical, and those can (hopefully) be fixed. The UI is clunky and unforgiving. It's not terrible, but there are certainly times you find yourself cursing the game because you committed to an action, only to find that you what you did isn't what you really wanted to do. In a game with no mid-game saves, those mistakes can be lethal. (Note, I'm not talking about tactical errors, but those times where the UI gives you a false perspective of what will happen.)  The graphics can be a problem, especially on snowy maps, where you can't even see where your units can move. You spend a lot of time squinting at the screen, moving the camera for better angles, and ultimately guessing that where you click will actually work as you intend (even with the grid on).  It's also sub-optimized, so the game takes up way more space and memory than I think it should, compared to similar games. This is another reason why I avoid kickstarter or early access for video games. When the money is collected before the product is finished, there's less emphasis on creating a fantastic game and then putting it to market, but rather trying to release an acceptable product and pocketing whatever's left over.  Overall, though, I'm enjoying the game. The developers are still working on it, too. Hopefully they'll finish cleaning up the bugs, graphics, and UI problems before they decide it's not worth the added expense. In the meantime, though, don't pay full price; its just not worth it right now.",

I see complaints about UI and all sorts of bugs, I got this game, created a unit list, and started playing quickmatch and figured it out in about 5 minutes. The game is lacking in unit rosters but has enough variability for each race that you can build your battlegroup any way you want to play. It isnt the most emmersive or the most well-toned game but for a digital tabletop this game is fantastic considering it isnt a AAA title.

In some ways, I really feel like it does capture the tabletop experience. Here's the problem: even at full commercial release, it still feels like a beta, perhaps even a fairly early beta. The UI is quite clunky, and I don't even want to talk about the problems I have sometimes trying to adjust a unit's facing. Framerates can also be quite terrible, doesn't work at all on my Macbook, only my dedicated gaming PC. Finally, the 'cutscenes' are frankly unprofessional. Using a model of a character and having it remain static while narrative audio plays is...well, something not really acceptable in 2014. Maybe in the 90s you could have done something like that, but not now. I could tolerate the cutscene issue if everything else was superlative, but the clunky controls are really what are killing me.   Ultimately, playing the pc game made me want to pull my minis back out and finish painting my pikemen. They at least got the atmosphere and the theme right.

The camera pans around and there is voice over but that is it. -The UI, all of it... -Buggy cursor registration -Completion of unit action phases is buggy, sometimes not completing properly and other times getting extra 'outside of action activity' -Tiny mini-map with no configuration. -Whenever voice-over text or instructions are displayed, all UI elements are disabled -You cannot return to menu during a cinematic, you can quit the game though.   --- I have friends who play the tabletop version and I was interested but didn't have the time or money to get into it. That said, they were excited about it so I backed the kickstarter for this game.   I finally ended up getting my Steam key last week because I noticed the game was on sale and I still hadn't even gotten my backer key yet. The turnaround was fairly fast from contacting them to getting my key but I still wasn't impressed that I never got a notice or key when the game was released in the first place.  --- Update:  I wasn't able to get powers and abilities hover information to work previously, even waiting 15 seconds while hovering over different areas. I was able to get these to work today after Eyl's comment stating that they were working for him. My problem last time could have been related to crash issues and forced process termination. The problem still remains though that there is no visual differentiation between what are section names, weapon names, abilities, special abilities. It is all in list format with no standard in font sizing or type.   For example:  Weapon name has a smaller font size than weapon damage/range information. Weapon damage/range information is the same font size as the 'Melee Weapons' or 'Ranged Weapons' headings. Shadowing on the fonts is random and appears to be a problem with it not being toggled on/off properly as it isnt standard across units or even in ability listings on a single unit.   Even if that was fixed right now the game still wouldnt be worth the $40 price tag. If they fixed all of the ui issues, cursor registration, buggy animations ( units turn backwards and then forwards upon completion of a move action ), and put actual cinematics or even comic style cinematics into the game I would consider looking at it again. However as the game currently stands I feel ripped off even at the backer price.",

            "review_text": "The big problem with Warmachine Tactics is that I kept finding myself ask 'who thought this bit was a good idea?' while playing it. While there's a whole host of performance and mechanical issues with the game, the reason why I keep uninstalling it is because far too many design choices are simply self-defeating.  Here's a few of them: -No saving in single player missions. -seemingly unskippable cutscenes (which can easily last 5 minutes, making replaying a mission truly obnoxious). -no way to leave multiplayer quick match without force quitting. - the utterly bizarre decision to fill cutscenes with frozen characters. Descends into farce when the camera zooms into motionless characters' faces when delivering exposition. -The conversion of the Warmachine ruleset into something where it feels like absurd effort has thrown at the simplest of enemies.  None of these seem to be design features that should have escaped QC, let alone early access. In particular, the unskippable, farcical cut-scenes smacks of a hole in the budget that got filled in an 'arty' fashion. Game balance feels truly out the window, simply because everything feels extraordinarily pillow-fisted, so massive effort has to be hurled at largely inconsequencial enemies.  The main gameplay feels like a kludgy, sticky mess where you often feel like you're fighting the controls more than the enemy. The AI is pants-on-head dumb, making Skirmish mode some what akin to shooting fish in a barrel. The conversion of the Warmachine ruleset often feels extraordinary restrictive and often poorly signalled (it is often hard to tell a unit's facing, which makes the facing rules a frequent pain). Knowledge of the tabletop game feels essential to making the game playable, yet the game doesn't clue you into the changes it's made to units' abilities so even that knowledge is often wrong. Mechanics and effects often feel wonky or unpredictable (I've watched an electro-leap leap to an enemy a screen away, which basically the opposite of what it's supposed to do). It often feels like the camera is deliberately annoying you, hiding itself behind terrain when you're trying to see what's going on.  Multiplayer feels extraordinarily hampered by a limited pallette of options as well as the aforementioned Quick Match issue. Frankly, I've gotten one game of multiplayer in the year I've owned the game. Apparently, multiplayer missions have flags and killboxes, but I've no idea what either looks like because the game doesn't seem to show them.  The core campaign is little better. It's your bog-standard 'discover macguffin, fight to macguffin, fight off people who want it, then destroy it' plot that seems to be the default RTS plot design and Sturgis might as well be called 'Arthas' for the originality in his contribution. Due to Jakes being as pillow-fisted as the rest of the units, the missions often feel like they've got a reversed difficulty level, with some of the toughest missions coming at the start and the late game missions feeling much easier. Again, the AI is dumb as a box of bricks, often letting you dictate the pace of missions because enemies often won't activate until you attack them (the sterling winner has to be a late mission, where the Butcher will gleefully run around in front of your guns like a headless chicken). Mission design itself often feels profoundly unfun, with many missions with multiple fronts, something that just doesn't work with the Warmachine game mechanics. The game often doesn't signal the arrival of enemy reinforcements, leading to you often just spotting reinforcements by accident halfway through a turn. I shouldn't have to play 'hunt the mechanithrall' at the start of the turn, but there's no better way to check you know what's going on. Missions often require you to keep a number of character units alive, but this often causes auto-wipes half-way through missions as they're profoundly squishy. Special marks have to go to the second longest running character in the campaign, known either as Sarge or 'Trencher Sergeant'. Looking identical to his fellow Trenchers, he's easy to lose to enemy attacks and suffers the indignity of never being given an actual name.  The unit selection feels a lot like someone went through the minature game, picked their favourite models and stuck them in. In particular, once you've unlocked Jakes' feat, it really doesn't feel like it works well with the rest of the Cygnaran army. It's a close combat buff, but there's only two melee infantry available and one of them already has all the buffs she hands out. There's also a paucity of repair units, which only makes the campaign harder. The 'alternate weapon' variants of infantry (like the Trencher Grenadier and Winter Guard Rocketeer) have almost identical (if there is a difference, I haven't noticed it) appearances, which means you often have no idea what the enemy troops are armed with until they fire it at you.  So the big question is 'can this be fixed?' I really don't think so. The game cries out for a complete overhaul of the mechanics, but that'll take ages and if it hasn't been done yet, I doubt it's ever going to happen. Fixing the awful cutscenes would cost a ton. Realistically, the only things that can be overhauled are the array of bugs and poor design choices. An option to save during missions and skip cutscenes would be a nice start to making this a lot more user friendly.  So in the end do I recommend this game? No. It simply never feels fun to play. While it has a few bright spots (a late game stealth mission is surprisingly fun for a stealth mission) the single player has a difficulty curve more akin to a roller-coaster, terrible cut-scenes and profoundly bad mission design. Skirmish mode is as challenging as beating a puppy and just as much fun. Multiplayer seems to be completely dead. It's a shame, but that's the truth.",

Units will face the wrong direction even when you tell it to change facing. This leads to two different units with their backs touching but they are swinging swords at each other?? Colors for walk/run/control area are very hard to see in the background colors of the boards and you cannot adjust them.

They made a great blend from the table-top game into a playable PC version. You really do feel like you're playing the table-top game in a new, dynamic way. That being said, the execution of idea hasn't been the best.  My last point, and this is my biggest issue with the game: $40 price tag?! For the quality of this game, that's way too high.

If you are looking for turn-based tactical squad combat, you are better off going to play XCOM, this game is poorly optimized, still buggy, and interactions within the game are not well explained.  The price and volume of microtransactions make this game an even worse buy.  I was hopeful for this game, but they strayed too far from the original mechanics, devoted a larger percentage of their time to modeling than they probably should have while under optimizing it, and even cut core concepts.  I have not yet finished the campaign, but so far it feels far too much on rails and forced, what they want to happen will happen regardless of what you try to do to stop it (for story reasons). You get the units they give you, and must play according to what you are given to succeed. They don't explain things you are shown until they feel you need to know, in an early mission you are shown in-game cut-scenes of someone running around at least 2-3 times before they tell you anything about what you are seeing and why it is relevant and potentially too late for you to react. It feels like all of the events that occur are just sitting waiting for a certain turn number before it tells you about it, I was stuck on one mission waiting for a thing to occur because I'd done too well the turns before. The leveling mechanic was a great idea, but also felt very generic. I would have enjoyed earning experience on unit types and being able to customize my forces.  Overall, it feels like this was wasted potential. There was a lot of money and support behind the game, but it feels like the developers went over budget in some early areas and were forced to cut back on concepts that they could no longer afford to develop, specifically lack of units, number of models on the board, size of the board and the campaign. At least I hope that is the case, because if the current product what the developers intended to make, I feel like that was not well communicated during the inital backing process.",

The gameplay itself is mediocre; activating units is clunky and the selection of units is unintuitive even after the (poor) tutorial at the beginning. After 5 missions, I finally realized I could just click on a portrait to activate a unit.   The objectives aren't always clearly defined as far as exactly what you need to do to complete them. The worst part of the missions is that the camera will instantly cut to an objective and then instantly back to a unit, leaving you no idea where the objective was on the map. Panning the camera there and back would be a huge improvement to give a sense of direction.  A few of the levels have impossible terrain to see what the hell is going on as far as the lines drawn on the ground for movement/spells/etc because the light blue or yellow lines aren't visible whatsoever upon the white snowcovered ground. Also, it's hard to tell where the mission is trying to have you escape to at times because there's nothing differentiating the escape point from any other hard edge of the map. Beacons would go a long ways in a few of the maps.  It's also super frustrating when you go 98% through an hour long mission just to have one of the characters die at the end to cause mission failure and require you to play through the whole thing again (and again, and again, and again) because they don't allow saves in the middle of missions. It makes gameplay feel like a torturuous chore and that they're punishing you for trying.  If you're a fan of the tabletop game (like myself) and you want to know the fluff behind Jakes then you have to suffer through this game. I've heard it's making strides in the right directions and I honestly think there's potential here but it's not polished enough yet to recommend and unless you love the backstory of the Iron Kingdoms I would wait for this game to get another 6-8 months of patches and fixes in before you play it because it's going to leave a bad taste in your mouth.",

And then they said 'now make a list of everything we could do better using a computer than a table top game'. and then they took those lists, and put them into one list and said 'don't put any of these things in the final game'.  They have masterfully combined a tabletop game with a computer game and somehow managed to take only the worst aspects of both, carefully dodging any positive aspect they might have accidentally picked up. In fact, they did such a good job making the game terrible I think they might have gone the extra mile and made lists of everything they could make worse from the table top game.

Having good graphics and smooth animations might allow players to become immersed in the game. This way is much better, there is almost no chance players will feel any excitement during a battle'  Tim: 'exactly! It is definitely best to avoid capitalizing on the fact that since this is a computer game we could actually render out the battles instead of having the players imagine them like in the mini war game'  Bob: 'oh hey guys, I just wanted to share my idea that for the opening cinematic we could have the characters talk about really exciting battles and interesting plot events'  Greg: 'I dunno Bob, that sounds a little to interesting for what we are trying to make here'  Bob: ' but thats just it, we wont ever actually show what they are talking about. It will be a huge entirely empty room in which two characters discuss interesting events that the player doesnt ever get shown'  Tim: 'good idea Bob, we could even go a step further by not bothering to animate the characters mouths and not giving them any interesting body anguage at all'  Greg: 'If we play this right we can take something that might have once been interesting and gotten the players excited to play our game and instead make it into a boring lecture that feels like it lasts for years'  Tim: 'hey bob, this is a turn-based skirmish level tactical strategy game which is almost exactly the same as the table top game, even using almost the same dice system'  Bob: 'yeah...'

By default the graphics are set to 'medium' or something, which means all characters, the terrain and the characters' portraits are extremely blurry which stands in stark contrast with the pixel-crisp GUI. The game was probably optimized for tiny screens, like 640x480 or something, as on my 1920x1080 the GUI elements are tiny and are scattered in the edges of the screen. The level minimap, for example, is smaller than a single soldier when viewed from max zoom out.   Even after I set all graphical settings to maximum and restarted the game, everything was still blurry. There might be something wrong in their shaders code or whatever, but all objects are too glossy and too bright, with large spots of plain white on many objects. The tutorial text is written in huge blurry font. Tutorial messages tell about what on-screen buttons do but at the same time the whole GUI is hidden, so you don't know what they are talking about. You will stop understanding the explained game mechanics about 1/3 into the tutorial. After that you will keep clicking the highlighted areas/buttons with no clue what's going on. Obviously the developers never tested the tutorial on anyone except themselves. The cutscenes are ugly and some of them can't be skipped. E.g. I wanted to exit the game during an endless cutscene, and the dialog to confirm exiting was there, but when you press 'Yes' (yes, please exit) it just hangs. This was the last straw for me.  My guess is that 90% of people who try the demo will exit it and uninstall it right after the tutorial stops showing its messages and lets you finish the first mission by yourself. Or rather, most will exit even before the tutorial shows anything, after seeing the super-blurry font.  All that said, the combat system seems to be pretty interesting (from what I could understand) and feels like something between XCOM Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga.

For now, if you want a great tatical game, pick up the tabletop version.",

The RNG system is so broken it makes a joke of the real game's balanced system. Things that shouldn't miss miss turn after turn and people that should not be able to kill warjacks can crit them into the ground. This game just leaves me with a very bitter taste in my mouth after it lured me in with hopes of being able to play warmachine.

Then this game is for you. Maybe you don't have acces to a decent gaming community.  I kickstarter this game because I was originally under the impress this was going to be something a little different. Maybe a little Company of Heroes, or Dawn of War 2 mixed with what we got set in the Warmachine Universe.  Since I play a very focused warcaster, (Captain Caine's Sons of the Tempest Tier List) that I can even field within the game I also end up feeling very limited in my options.  So, What's all this mean? Keep these things in mind. If you have never played Warmachine, but are interested. This is a decent introduction, gives you an idea of the scope (from the minutae of the individual character dramas to the grand scale of the nation conflicts) If you are fan of Warmachine as a whole, this if a fairly faithful reproduction of the the tabletop experience (and I guarentee you won't have terrain like this on your tabletop unless you are mad ballin') If you a very Caster or faction focused Caveat Emptor. Your options might be very limited or might not exist at all (yet?)",

I love the tabletop game and I was very excited about a computer version. Sadly, the only thing that really makes it worth playing is the single player storyline, which is decent, and the atmosphere. The game mechanics have been redone to the point where it's a completely different game system - so different that my interest in the multiplayer is quickly dying. It's not a game for WM/H gamers, it's a generic computer game based on Privateer Press IP, and it's not a very good one.  For people who aren't into the tabletop game, there is little point in buying this. I enjoy it mostly because of my love for the setting, I doubt I'd have played more than a few missions otherwise. The camera is annoying and takes a lot of work, the interface is clunky and inelegant, the game is riddled with bugs (including crash-bugs and bugs that allow both the player and the computer to do things like walking through walls), there are still minor problems that should have been gone long before launch (like the colour of various important lines and markers being too light to see on snow, or disappearing under landscape features), the default settings for sound and graphics are way off (I had to reduce the music volume to 2/10 to hear voices), you can't skip cut-scenes (adding to the irritation when you have to restart a mission - there is no option for saving during missions)... the list goes on forever.  In short, this game had a lot of potential, but it is so far away from being what it could that no amount of patching can fix it. I regret buying it at full price, and would caution others against doing the same.",

I really enjoyed the first dawn of war game and the second was... Fine i guess, but I had really gotten into the Iron Kingdoms, so this was it, my chance to play some Warmachine. The first issue arose immediately, the price, a kickstarter game should not be so ridiculously expensive, but that was OK, I'd just wait for a steam sale like I usually do and play some of the demo while I waited. The second issue peaked it's ugly head above water while playing the demo, the gameplay was an entire city constructed primarily of klunk and the unit selection was puny, but it was only a free demo so I just (incorrectly) assumed that there was a veritable cornucopia of content just behind the locked door, what a fool I was. Even with access to the full game the unit selection was pitiful and the klunk city limits stretched into the horizon, but maybe patches will fix it, thought I, which is where the third issue burst forth from the ground like some horrible cyclopean beast, the same beast which has strangled so many potentially great titles in their cribs, I speak of course of DLC. As other reviewers have no doubt mentioned the DLC is overpriced, even with the newly announced 'price cut' each clocks in at $10 and while this may not be as egregious for the Mercs or Retribution bundles (it still is) the Warcaster and Jack bundles are simply ludicrous, 4 units for $10? I would rather not sell my home, but thank you for the kind offer.  So the question still remains, is it good? Is it worth my hard earned dollars/pounds/euro/whatever? The answer, in my opinion is an emphatic but remorseful no. If this game wants to be anything other than a floundering, half funtional cash grab it needs a lot of work, the klunkiness needs to be reduced considerably, the factions need to be expanded and the DLC needs to be added as regular content available upon purchase and expanded as well. If they do enact these changes I truely believe we will have a game which both promotes its source material and allows enthusiasts without an outlet (such as myself) to experiance the world of the Iron Kingdoms. Until then keep an eye on the reviews, you never know, the creators may decide that they don't need to bleed their creation for every cent and give us the game we crave and deserve.",

It is set on the lowest possible video setings and all my other games play just fine. There are no crash logs for this event. It crashes on the enimies turn when it switches to the next in line. I have only attempted the single player mode because I don't want to put anyone through me spending more time attempting to get the camera to look at what I need to see than actualy playing the game.   Bad on you WhiteMoon Dreams for realeasing this as 'ready.' I can play a game that is in alpha or beta, expect this type of experience and be okay with it. This is unacceptable.  So if you are as excited about this game as I was, DO NOT BUY IT, wait for them to finish it or lower the price to about $15.",
