            "review_text": "Caster is an average third person shooter that does not contain any notable qualities, aside from the ability to destroy terrain and perform ridiculous map-crossing leaps.  Your objective in each level is to either kill every enemy or do a generic fetch quest (there are a few other missions with different objectives but they're uninteresting, for example; shoot a tree). Every level is incredibly short, and even on my first time, each one averaged no longer than a minute. Speaking of game length, the entire thing isn't longer than an hour. The game abruptly ends with a 'To Be Continued...', and despite being released in 2009, there has been no continuation, and it seems the website does not hint at anything of the sort either.  Enemies are all very generic, and each one of their attacks can be easily avoided by just sprinting around or jumping. Even if they do manage to hit you, they deal hardly any damage, and they are easily dispatched; even more so with the weapon upgrades.   The story is uninspired, and unless you've never heard or seen the 'It's humans against aliens, you're our only hope!' plot, then I doubt you'll be interested. As I stated earlier, the game ends at a very unexpected random point with sequel bait.   A map editor is available, but I did not use it or download custom maps, so I cannot comment on that.  I did not find Caster to be particularly interesting in any way. Terrain destruction and super speed can be fun and worth it if you paid 0.14 cents, but beyond that, there's not much else that the game offers.",

Casters, having vast amount of magical energies can run fast, kill Flanx with lasers, and restore trees to their natural beauty. Now its up to one caster to defeat the Flanx and restore the land.

            "review_text": "Let's say something honest about this game.  This game makes me sad. Not because it is mediocre (just mediocre though, not utterly shameful), but because it tries and fails.  Caster has a few features which got me entertained for some time despite the poor overall quality of the game. The character movements are well-done and it's pleasant to jump n' run around with actually quite much fluidity. The entire terrain deformation feature also made me have a bunch of fun at it's well-included in the level design (I'd even say this is pretty much the only thing that keeps the lev-des acceptable along with the variety of the environnements).   BUT.   The first thing which will strike you is the graphics. Jesus. I know it's Elecorn's first game, but the game came out in 2009 and I felt like I was playing an early PS2 game. The textures are low-res (giving by the way to your character the face of an eternal suffering) and the models are quite polygonal.  While I'm at it with the general graphics, the particle and pyrotechnic effects are horrendous. When you cast an attack, you really don't have a feel of empowerment because they just look so weak and unimpressive. Some fire and explosions would be welcome in order to take these pew-pews to the next level. Even the attacks from your ennemies are looking unthreatening, while they in fact at medium defficulty deal a good bunch of punch. This seems like a detail, but that will make the boredom come at you in an even shorter time.  Now 'bout the the gameplay. Like I said, there are a few interesting things which brings some spice to your adventure. But the gameplay is seriously too repetitive. There are tens of levels and the objective is always the same. Either kill all the ennemies, pick up some energy balls or make a dead tree come back to life. And it's a shame, because this game has potential. There could've been much more things to do, especially with the pleasant movement system and the different attacks to gather along the game.  Oh, yes, the attacks. There's a total of six attacks which are, like I said, pretty unimpressive, but fun to use for a little time. You have a basic pulse laser attack, a charged blast attack which deals great damage to both the ennemies and the environnement, an ability to raise the level of the ground, seeking missiles, stunning lasers and a (quite useless) shield.  Not only they look pitiful, but their upgrade system is too classical and bulky, and you just gather these attacks by approaching spheres which are spread in the in-game world. You don't acquire them by defeating bosses or gathering an out-of-the-ordinary object, nah. You just encounter 'dem spheres and yoohoo, magical attack learning. That is and will remain too simplistic and it totally does not give any feeling of accomplishment.  I could bash this game for a longer time, but this is just sad to look at. There's been effort and you can feel it. And I don't want to be too harsh on somthing that's been the output of many hours of work. So I just hope Elecorn will learn from its failures of the past and make us a neat Caster 2 in the future. Because they really seem to have good ideas, and good ideas leads to potential.  C'mon. You can do it, guys.",

This game was released 6 years ago and there's about 2 hours worth of play currently. This game is due for a major update or at least a well-rounded sequel, complete with an actual story-line, explanations as to what the hell you're doing and why, and some variation to gameplay other than 'hold down mouse button, run fast, collect orbs.'  This game looks ♥♥♥♥ing neat. It looks like it should be amazing. I REALLY want to like this game. But I can't honestly say I'm thrilled with it. For it's cheap price, it's totaly worth it.

Upon playing it, I was pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is simple but very fun. It's a third person run and gun action game that puts you in arenas of varying sizes, each with a simple task to complete. There isn't a lot of variety in these tasks, it's either collect orbs, destroy monsters or a boss, or shoot a tree... it makes sense in context. The game isn't very challenging or long, I beat all the currently available missions within three hours and a good chunk of that time was just faffing about running and jumping for fun. The mobility in this game is what makes it so fun. Running and high jumping all over the map kept me amused and entertained throughout the whole game. There's also an arsenal of weapons that range from rapid fire homing bolts to terrain morphing blasts that make the gameplay more unique. The art and design style leaves a lot to be desired. Everything is blocky and unpolished. It looks like an early PS1 game in alpha. Still, it doesn't really affect gameplay so it's not a big deal. There hasn't been many updates to this game even though it's pretty old so don't expect new content. There are community mods, however, so you're not limited to the main game. Even then, this game is reasonably priced so you're not getting ripped off if there aren't any more updates. I'd say, give it a try. It's far from perfect but for what it is, it's fun. Plus, it'll kill a couple hours if you're bored.",

There was a couple of times where I kinda dicked around a lot, but it was fun. Cons: -The levels/worlds are not very expansive, it can take anyone not even 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other. -The games levels also kind of seem unfinished, they made landscaping where they wanted you to go. Only one level was actually good, it was kind of a swampy level. -Small variety in enemies. Over all, this game was a bit rushed, or it was someones first project, I have no clue.

Once I opened the game it just looked like another generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low-priced videogame that people buy because profit, but just for good measure I started playing it. I was shocked because of all the options it has, quite impressed to be honest that in a game like this you can change the depth of field, resolution, shadows and so on and so forth.  The gameplay is actually pretty well designed, the combat is a little bit repetitive not going to lie but you do have a quite variety of weapons to chose from if you so desire, even though the balance in this game is ABSOLUTELY disgusting. You can kill the final boss of the first campaign just by freezing the damn thing and shooting it with your basic attack. The dash ability is ridiculously Overpowered as well as the super jump which at this rate might as well be called flying because that's exactly what you end up doing, flying through half of the map, stay on the ground for a few seconds and then take off to get to the other side of the map. Another thing that bothers me is the fact that the game doesn't actually encourage you to complete all of the stages without taking any damage other than the 2,000 bonus credits you get that are incredibly useless once you are fully upgraded (at last in the part of the game I stopped playing). Guns are too powerful, enemies are the same and predictable and the game is way too easy, I literally just finished the first campaign using two weapons and the others just to pick up the Energy Orbs when needed. Nice game it is worth the price just needs more attention on the balance side of things.",

Spoiler 5. Upgrading system was a pretty thing to add in the game.  Debuffs! 1. Character models look wierd as hell. 2.Not like a long story I could possibly beat this game less in 2 hours heck 1. 3.They just had area block off like a big wall not like a certain area sealed off.  Not much for the debuffs.  One thing I was ok with! The game was really slow in the start but becomes really fast paced later on.",

You have 6 different weapons (that you collect as you progress) with which you can kill/stun your enemies, but the enemy variety is little, and basically it's always a question of running around the enemies to avoid being hit and shoot them until they die. Levels are really small, and with the instructions + map it's very easy to finish them.  Sound effects are basic, and there's no story to get involved with. A plus of the game is the options' menu, very rich, but all in all I simply wouldn't recommend playing the game. Pick it up only if it's heavily discounted.  One final thing: on Mac, this game crashed once while I was playing, and once it failed to launch.",

I first played Caster when it first came out on the IOS in 2009. I had a fun time, but was dissipointed when I got a 'To be Continued' screen. Imagine my excitement now in 2015 when I could pick up the game again 6 years later! Sadly, it did not hold up in the years. No progress has been made to the game whatsoever. I checked the guys website and while this is a side project, he seems to have started working on other things. I found 2 'update' posts on updating caster in the past 3 years, but so far nothing has changed. I feel like the person who made this game just wants to move on and this game will never be finished.  Story wise it's meh. You are a Caster which are people who fight against creatures called the Flux. You are coming out to be a prodigy, and are a great asset to the Caster Community with your help in the research of Nega Orbs. That's where it ends because the game isn't finished. It's an interesting concept, but it's not execute to its full potential. 3/10  Graphics wise, its decent. The enviroments are nice considering its very basic. A few issues I had are mostly with the main character. He looks horrible. While from behind it's ok, his face is terrifying I couldn't help but be pulled away from the experience everytime I saw his messed up eyes and weird smile. I really would want to change it. Also his animation cycles are also meh. With his run and jump being but faster or holding it, I feel it could have been approached diffrently. 5/10  Music is pretty good. Honestly if it wasn't for the music, this game would be way more lacking. It's good electronic for the setting. Nothing else to really say about it. 7.5/10  Gameplay is mixed. At first, you start off pathetically weak as the first 2-3 missions are a challenge. But then Early Mid game becomes fun as you level up your abilties. You actually feel very powerful with the destruction of the envirmont, almost godlike. However, later on the game falls off. Missions are repeated, just in diffrent stages. Enemies either take way to many hits for the 'powerful' feeling. Or they are impossible to hit like the flys. No joke, I spent a good 10 minutes trying to kill a group of flys, because the only way to hit them is with the seeker power, and even that it's almost impossible. Creature design was pretty fun, I especially like the battle with the flux that would grab you and slow you down, but most of the enemies are boring. The one's that really do shine are the bosses and the creatures with abilities like yours. The game also moves to fast for it's own good. I had a hard time being able to hit enemies because I had to run at max speed dodging bullets while I tried my best to charge and fire my shots. Also most of the abilities are kinda worthless. The blue laser, the seeker and the land destory abilites are the only real abilities you should put into besides one mission were you need to use the land build up to move a orb to the other end. 5/10  Final Verdict 5.5/10. It's a fun game that you can play to burn up an hour or so. But I can't recommend getting this game at the full $3. It's a bit weird and won't keep you invested and finally, you will never see this game finished most likely.",

You are put into the shoes of a young Caster who is tasked with defeating the evil Flanx and restoring peace to the realm of Middon. Did I mention that you also get to go fast like Sanic? Yes, you heard me right, in this game, you GOTTA GO FAST! The controls are a little wonky, but it's not anything that bad, even when you are blazing along at tremendous speed. You also have six attacks at your disposal. Each attack serves its purpose, and you will find yourself using each attack equally as much, which is a sign of good balancing. The enemies, however, are bullet sponges, which can be frustrating at times. The greatest thing about the combat is how you can manipulate the terrain; not many games allow you to do this. The graphics in this game look like something from 1995, but this is the game's artstyle. It is meant to harken back to a time with simpler graphics. The graphics don't detrimentally affect the game at all. The game runs at 60 FPS, so you can smoothly sanic without worrying.

This is not because I don't like old games, it is simply that this game isn't the most 'feature-ful' of higher priced games. In this game you shoot things with six different attacks (one making the game far more interesting and fun by raising the ground where it hits) and you collect generic orbs of light.

Funnily enough, you can normally dash up vertical inclines; the level 'Treacherous Tower' allows you to dash straight up to the exit and skip the level. Pretty generic action shooter, there isn't really a story. Levels aren't really too varied in objectives or visuals. The only things that exist in this world are you, enemies, trees and the terrain. There are several varied types of weapons and shooting the terrain can change it (usually lower/raise). You don't really use the terrain until the second chapter (currently 'To Be Continued'), where one unique level requires you 'escort' a ball to the exit point by raising the terrain in front of it to remove the acid.  I first upgraded Dash and Pulse and could skip enemies, collect orbs, and skip through the levels. You don't need to fight enemies in most levels. After upgrades, you have pretty good mobility to run around, shoot things and collect orbs which is the whole game (or run around, avoid things and collect orbs like me).  If you don't care about graphics or story and just want to run around shooting random things and collect orbs, then you might like this game. This seems more fit as a decent 3rd-party game for the N64. It's not a terrible game, but there doesn't seem to be a point to continue playing except if you like the combat for mindless fun.",
