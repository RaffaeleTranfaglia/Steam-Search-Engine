However, one of my friends just got some dollar from doing sick GFX and wanted to buy a game.  At first, he wanted Lego ♥♥♥♥ing Batman (Yes, I know) but he remembered this amazing game, this pinnacle of game design. So, he bought 4 copies of this game (1 for myself, himself, and two other friends), and we began to play.  I downloaded and launched the game, and imediatly I was engulfed in lovely fapping sounds. I fell in love. We began to play, I could feel the inner mount coming out from deep inside of me. It was a good feeling.  I love this game, it truely is amazing. Thank you creator, thank you so so much.",

            "review_text": "There isn't much to Mount your Friends. It's a quirky competitive game where you use physics and sticky hands and feet to climb and fling yourself to the top of the tower made up of all the other players. Every player mounting the tower makes it taller until eventually someone wins. It's really simple, well polished, but really fun to play with friends.  Solo content is available but it's not too interesting and without enemy AI, it's mostly challenges such as climb one of several given obstacle courses. Multiplayer is the preferred choice if you can grab some friends to play with. You'll be hard pressed at times to find anyone else hosting a public game. Customization is also an option, you can use some of the preset stuff to customize your team or import your own images for the body and head. This is a really cool feature that me and my friends have been abusing to import ridiculous looking characters into our game. The downside is they don't work in multiplayer, only you can see them unless you share the exact same picture with everyone else you're playing with. I'm hoping the devs patch something in to fix this but until then, the best solution is packing everything all your friends are using into a zip file on dropbox and just pass it around to all your friends.  Multiplayer has 2 Gameplay modes and 2 Variable Weather Effects that change the gameplay. Vertical climb is a simple climb to the top of the growing tower of friends. Horizontal is the same but the tower must extend to the right of the screen instead of the top. These two games modes are accompanied by Space and Storm weather effects which change the physics somewhat to challenge you. Space gives you low gravity, which makes jumping and flinging yourself around easier, but also more dangerous. Flinging yourself too far on Horizontal can lead to falling into the pit below and instantly losing, while in Vertical, you can accidentally fling yourself off the tower which spells doom for most situation. Storm halts your progress by always pushing you to the left in a windy storm. This makes it hard for everyone to move or climb and flinging yourself is a lot harder.  Overall it's quick and easy fun, you can kill time playing it or have a game night with friends, flinging off of Bill Nye in a Bra to achieve your victory. While the Single player content is lacklustre, Multiplayer is fun and worth the money if you have friends to play it with.   At £4 it's an easy purchase, unless you really need that £3.99 Whopper Meal.  You fat monster",

Look at the pictures on the store page, now imagine those gentlemens' packages swinging independently as they climb up towers of other gentlemen and try not to laugh. If that doesn't make you laugh, you probably don't enjoy fun. And if it does, buy this game.  It's a fantastic addition to a same-screen competitive game collection and a definite winner at game nights. I wouldn't bother if you only like solo games, but playing this against someone else is guaranteed to generate some laughs.  One thing I didn't realize when I bought the game is that there are multiple game modes, and some of them are a ton of fun too. Another point for Mount Your Friends.",

This game is great for the family. The characters of which people will create are prime examples, teaching our children who to trust when they come out of school.  Ive enjoyed alot of time on this game flinging my carcass around on my friends bodys.  This game really shows what the gymnists that dont make it to the Olympics look forward to as they seem to be the only people who can bend in these ways.   I have been inspired though and every day I throw my self from my second floor balcony with the hopes of breaking my fall with my donger on someones head.  My only complaint is the obvious feminism going on there, not once have I seen a Lady Friend with Tig Ole Bittes flinging her carass at me. No, all I get are dongers, and it goes to show you how opressive even the simpliest of games like this can be.",

I received this game as a gift and I did not want to even install it. However, this would have made me an a**hole for not accepting my friends gift. Three of us played together for a few hours the first night, and I will say that I was laughing so hard at certain points that tears were pouring out of my eyes and it became difficult for me to focus on the screen. And the laughter is not just from the swinging ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In fact, the ♥♥♥♥♥ is forgotten about pretty quickly. What is amazing about this game is, seeing someone smoothly walk up to the goat for the first time. Or when you see someone perfom a quadruple flip from the bottom of the pile to the top and grab the piles peak in a smooth, swift, and sexy motion.  In a game where everything is filled with such frustrating and awkward movements, seeing someone accomplish something that appears to be a well timed and coordinated move is simply amazing. It is awe inspiring. And it motivates me to want to be better at it. I want to learn how to walk. That sounds so crazy to say, but in all seriousness, the ability to walk fluidly from your spawn to the goats rear end is a skill possessed by gods.  As difficult as a simple task such as walking may be, the controls are intuitive and allows a person to start playing immediately (side note: I am playing this on a X360 controller and imagine a keyboard would be more difficult.)  I definitely encourage every one to buy and play this with friends. It is a great time. I have since purchased 2 gifts for other friends, and I will probably buy more.",
