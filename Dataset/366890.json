Polishing/Effort: 1/10. When minimized, the window title is 'Application 1'. That's bad. Overall: 1/10. Can't imagine how this made it onto Steam and got cards, no less.",

            "review_text": "Nothing doesn't mean nothing. Turns out, nothing means Hulk Hogan. Somebody get BAD NEWS BROWN on the blower to break it to him. I warned alllllll of you since the Pontiac Silverdome. Hulk Hogan is a TOILET MAN.  Hogan, I may be a ghost now, talkin' from the tombstones, but I've still got my ear to this grape vine and I've been hearing some DIABOLICAL WHISPERS about your behavior. Now, if I am one thing other than the greatest wrestler to ever dominate the squared circle it is a good judge of character.  I knew you were trouble from the moment you first ran in on my match with Brutus the Barber Beefcake with a chair. People thought you were a real abolitionist but it turns out the only thing you were interested in abolishing was the Mega Powers with your treacherous tricks.  I am ROYALLY VINDICATED.  Brothers? Ohhhhhh YEEEEEEEAH! Rap-talkin', daughter-touchin', no sideways-caps-allowin' Hulksters want to talk about brothers.  Let me tell you what a brother doesn't do in the Macho Man book by Macho Man Randy Savage. A brother doesn't sell his friend out to Ted DiBiase. A brother doesn't put Miss Elizabeth in DANGER. A brother doesn't do somethin' so heinous that my feud with him gets deleted from the WWE website. Macho Man didn't do nothing. I'm still a legend. But I'm COLLATERAL DAMAGE on Hulk Hogan's ROAD TO RUINS. I'm like Bubba the Love Sponge's marriage. I'm like a video on Gawker, getting SCRUBBED AND RUBBED.  Let me drop some more DYLANN TRUTH on you, Hogan. I am better than everyone in the World Wresting Federation, Hogan, but I learned that in the ring, not WEARING A HOOD and reading Mein Kampf from the library. Morgan Freeman says they track who checks that out, BROTHER, so you better watch yourself. Because at this point, he could beat you from one side of Royal Rumble to the other.  I may look like Crypt Keeper with a painted-on hobo beard, but you're looking like a Costco chicken that would get winded from a CHEST SLAP. And you're still signin' them tweets HH.  Hulk Hogan may not want Booker T back in chains, but he has nothing against running into the ring on WCW Monday Nitro and putting him through a table. Using two chairs and tagging in half the NWO. Yeah, pure athlete Booker T would do a flying scissors kick or the Bookend. Meanwhile OLD MAN HOGAN would showboat for a LEG DROP. It's RAW HATE FEELINGS like that why I joined up with Zeus at Summer Slam only to lose once again to Hogan treachery.  It's a record more broken than a Brooke Hogan CD lost in a trucker's seat cushion. Every time anyone trusts this WICKED WARRIOR they are sure to be burned like a cross at a Hogan family pasta pool party. This is as DEVIOUS as it is DISGUSTING.  It turns out the REAL HULKAMANIA is lack of empathy for the struggle of others growing up in a diverse nation like ours. So put down the REBEL FLAG, Hogan, and pick up the Stars and Stripes. It's time to take down the Hogan flying over the capital D for DIPWAD.",

            "review_text": "This is quite possibly one of the worst games on Steam at the moment. While Steam Greenlight can occasionally let players get access to a gem of an indie game that they might have otherwise missed, Zombie Zoeds is the sort of game that makes it abundantly clear that Greenlight is more often an over-abused program that lets scamware slip through the cracks.  First off, Zombie Zoeds feels like the sort of game that you should be able to play for free on a dodgy flash website. You know the sort, right? The kind that clutters up the browser window with malicious ads that attempt to install spyware onto your computer.  Don't let the trailer video fool you, because the music in this game is non-existant, and the sound effects and animations are minimal. There's some ambient sound in the early part of the game, in the form of chirping crickets, but it seems to cut out randomly. The controls are extraordinarily awkward, instructions on keybindings are completely absent, and when you die the game simply cuts back to the title screen without any sort of 'Game Over' screen. There's a basic scoring mechanic, but it's entirely meaningless and your score only resets when you exit and restart the program, rather than when you die and start a new game.  The game is missing very basic functions, such as an options screen, a volume slider, and the ability to run the game in windowed mode. On top of that, it quickly becomes obvious that the developers are native to Europe, and that they couldn't even be bothered to do some very basic translation work ('Patrons' instead of 'Ammo', 'Lazer' instead of 'Laser').  Even ignoring that, the developers in this case have been dodgy since day one. They originally offered the game as part of a bundle, under the title 'Zombie Zoids'. In an apparent attempt to avoid this obligation, they changed the title by one letter to 'Zombie Zoeds'. When they finally owned up and distributed the game to everyone who had payed for it, the game was missing it's primary executable file and could not be played - and when they actually DID include one, it registered on some virus scanners as a potential backdoor virus.  Even now the Steam page is rife with lies, promising Steam Achievements (absent), Steam Cloud Support (absent), and Steam Workshop (absent). The only saving grace is that the game DOES have Steam Cards enabled, so if you got the game at a deep enough discount you may be able to make your money back by farming the cards.  But honestly, if you're after cards, then you'd probably be better off just buying booster packs on the Steam Market rather than cluttering up your playlist with this mess.",

I got this game gifted to me by a friend, decided to give it a shot.  Since i kinda suck at writing reviews i'm gonna keep this simple.  Even IF you like shooting zombies, don't get it.  The Graphics look like they were made using MSPAINT by a toddler. The Spelling of almost every word inside the game is wrong. The game has a loading option in the menu (Load game i assume)  but it does not have a way to save the game (as far as i know)  My gameplay experience: Started up the game, Menu screen looked like crap, not even an indication that you are mousing over the text. Decided to click New game since it was my first time and after a few seconds a game screen comes up with a blue bloblike figure that looks like it's holding a grey stick. Decide to move up and i see an EXACT copy of the Menu screen on the ground of the playing field. Zombies attack me and i have to kite them in lanes to be able to line up a shot. (Your character shoots in the direction you are moving, not where your mouse is pointing)  Zombies trap me between themselves and the hitbox of one of the gazillion trees (that ALL look the same i might add) and end up killing me.  Decided to exit out of the game by opening up a menu of sorts, there is none! no way to exit the game (i thought) no way to save my game? So i decide to press ALT+F4....  Last thing i see before the game closes is the game in my taskbar named as 'Application 1'.  Small summary:  Pro: - Played to short to find any good points, But it has blob shaped things the developer calls Zombies i guess  Cons: - Horrible Artwork - Horrible Grammar - Horrible Hitboxes - Horrible AI - Horrible Controls - No In-game menu's - No Tutorials - No In-game directions - Everything looks the same (Zombies, Trees, landscape)  More or less stated this before: If you are still debating to get this game because it's only 99 cents, Go to McDonalds and get you something to eat for that 1 cent extra, you will enjoy it more!",
