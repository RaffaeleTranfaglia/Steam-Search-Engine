Recomended, but only if you are willing to look past flaws in the graphics and A.I. A flawed but still enjoyable gem, in my humble opinion.",

I remember when this game first came out, the reviewers slammed it for some reason - while I had one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life. No - it's not Half-Life 2 - but it's a GREAT game with a lot of original ideas and classic gaming moments.",

Tons of Enemies to kill and A story that makes you think.and if you get bored of using a musket?Why not mow down everybody in the Civil war with an AR155 instead?  10/10 would go back in time and quickscope again.",

            "review_text": "Good concept marred by merely servicable plot and execution. The rules about what affects time and what doesn't is really wonky as well. It does get points for using battles (Antienum and Tanneburg) that aren't used much in games.  The section of the game in Pompeii feels horribly unbalanced and even nonsensicle. There is also the problem that you get a massive chunk of plot dopped on your head in a single ending cutscene with the vague promise of a sequel to resolve it.",

This game is glichty as all Hell, runs like crap and looks like crap. but for some reason i still love it. I dont know why, maybe its the feeling of mowing down civil war soldiers with a future machine gun, or burning poor Romans with a flamethrower. This game says its about time travel but you'll be spending most of your time in the Civil War and WW1 with a few missions outside of those. For a FPS this game has Alot of actors on screen at one time, ~300, and the moments where you're standing in close order drill in the civil war is just loads of fun. For me the WW1 era missions are really hit and miss and the 3 or 4 other missions in the game are great. The story overall is Meh. This game has its moments so ill recommend, but really look into it if you want to buy it. Id get it on a sale if you're unsure. Its a bad game, but for me a lovable one. Some parts are pure magic, others are that one zepplin mission.... Seriously.... ♥♥♥♥ YOU ZEP.",

For me personally it has an exciting story line where you really can't guess what while happen next. The theme of tipping ancient times and time travel is always interesting to see and be a part of in a virtual experience.  With an enemy you won't see coming and a vareity of weapons to tip the balance, it's not something you see everyday in games set in the past and it brings a new experience to the action.  For me it was a great game and I would recommened this to people who love shooter games with sci-fi or time travel elements.",

If you like history and single player only first person shooter story driven games I definately recommend this. The only thing this game is missing is high quality production values.  The A.I. appear in vast numbers but are really dumb, characters look like clones and glitch through scenery whilst the games campaign lasts around 8 hours.   In short its a budget game made special by its original concept.  If any shooter deserves a high quality well made sequel or spiritual successor its Darkest of Days.... We can only hope.",

            "review_text": "My take on the Game  + explores two eras that have been left behind in the gaming industry (US civil war and World War One) + gun upgrade system related to ingame performance (and guns change visually to some upgrades) + good maps (very open; much happens in multiple areas and sidepaths which allows for some replayability, ...) + NPC's use languages according to nationality (German NPC soldiers in ww1 speak german most of the time, ...) + graphics were good for their time  - story leaves you with quite a cliffhanger yet no sequel can be expected - characters are sometimes dull - NPC's, like in many other games, spam 'battle cries' - even though NPC's use the language according to their nationality the translations and voices themselves are frankly poorly made (german NPC soldiers in ww1 sometimes speak like some english dude tried to speak german or something that isn't even german, ...) - AI is sometimes not all that intelligent - logical errors (you change history yet people from the future somehow still remember how history was supposed to go down, ...) - only story- and some kind of skirmish-mode  ---------------------------------------------  In Deutsch:    Was ich vom Game halte:  + Erkundet zwei Ären welche von der Spieleindustrie vernachlässigt werden (den US Bürgerkrieg und den Ersten Weltkrieg) + Waffenupgradesystem verbunden mit der Performance des Spielers (ebenfalls verändern sich die Waffen nach einigen Upgrades visuell) + Gute Karten (sehr offen, vieles passiert in mehreren Arealen und Alternativrouten was etwas Wiederspielwert gibt, ...) + NPC's benutzen die Sprache ihres Landes (Deutsche NPC im Ersten Weltkrieg reden meistens Deutsch, ...) + Graphik war gut für ihre Zeit  - Die Geschichte lässt einen mit einem Cliffhanger zurück und es kann kein zweiter Teil erwartet werden - Charaktere sind manchmal langweilig - NPC's spammen Schlachtrufe wieder und wieder - Auch wenn die NPC Wahrheitsgetreue Sprachen sprechen sind die Übersetzungen und Stimmen selber manchmal einfach nur schlecht (Deutsche Soldaten im Ersten Weltkrieg sprechen manchmal so, als ob ein Engländer Deutsch zu sprechen versuchte oder sogar etwas, das nicht einmal Deutsch ist, ...) - Die AI ist manchmal nicht ganz helle - Logische Fehler (Man verändert die Geschichte aber die Leute aus der Zukunft scheinen die Geschichte noch immer so zu kennen wie sie eigentlich ablief, ...) - nur Story- und Plänkelei-Modus",
