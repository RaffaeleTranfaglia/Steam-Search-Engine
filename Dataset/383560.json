            "review_text": "First Impressions: Mix between Minecraft, Terarria and Realm of the Mad God. They say inspired by Terarria, but I think it's mostly like ROTMG. Not as fast pace as I wished it to be, but non the less it was fun for the little time I spent making a video on it.  I missed a whole bunch of times, which I will most likely come to figure out, but as of now, I don't know why I miss.  I would recommend this game to all, mostly to the ROTMG fans that would like a singleplayer experience.  10/10  PS: To the people who think these devs will get sued for taking ROTMG sprites, they wont. ROTMG doesn't own them, you can buy the graphics online for $25.",

            "review_text": "Played for a good amount of time. I don't have a lot of survival game exposure, but I do prefer 2D over 3D environments when available, so I looked for something like this when I wanted to check out survival games. I've yet to get Terraria, but this would probably be my follow-up after I get finished playing around with this game.  I've had to dump a lot of collected gear and I mostly dump them into treasure chests and leave them at my shelter, old shelter or at cave entrance 'shrines' I'd create to make the cave entrances more visible on the map. The underworld is full of torches I place around as I investigate for ore, treasure and experience heavy monsters.  Spoiler: Collect bones from skeletons to make a powerful sword that moves the game forward a lot faster. I found skeletons on the first and second levels of the underworld and I assume the deeper I go, the more powerful the monsters may grow.  My problems with the game are the large mobs of wizards that control strongholds throughout the surface area. However, I've taken it as a challenge to grow powerful enough to take on and wipe out these strongholds. I hope these structures are defeatable with a computer as powerful as mine. As noted in a prior review, these wizard mobs tend to spam attack and lag the game for me, which is frustrating and prevents effective skirmish assaults to pick off these fools.  There does seem to be a lot more to discover in this game and I see myself putting at least another score of play hours into this game. I hope the developers return to this game and enhance it into popularity. Finally, Realm of the Mad God wasn't appealing to me as I wasn't looking for another MMO and as someone who has contributed some minor pixel art and effort into a game (The Mana World), I know I'd be honored to have many games use my art. I hope that more of this style of art is developed and used by Squarelands or a sequel to it and grow the play factor by leaps and bounds. So instead of backing away from these graphics, double down and be proud to use them.",

            "review_text": "If this were an early access game, I'd say that it was a fun little prototype with tons of potential. However, this is considered to be the finished product and I just can't recommend it. In short, it's very buggy, very unbalanced, and very light on content. You'll be ridiculously overpowered after 10 minutes, and you'll have seen everything that the game has to offer after about an hour or so.  It's such a shame because the whole top down mining game concept works really well, playing this game can be addictive, fun and relaxing but you're just constantly reminded of how much better it could be with more time and effort spent.  If I were the dev, I'd pull this and either go into early access or work on it for a year or two until it's ready.",

            "review_text": "This game is full of bugs. First thing I noticed is that i cannot actually change my Class or the Sex of my character. 'Alright, maybe you just need to unlock the other classes' I thought, so I started the game as an Archer. Hmm. I have to stretch all the way over to the 'I' key to open my Inventory and Crafting menu?? Oh wait! I remember reading that the keys were completely rebindable! Awesome!! I went to change my Inventory button to Tab, which worked just fine. But what do you know? The Tab button also changes the minimap size/turns it off.. okay, no worries, i'll change that to M for 'Map'.. Nope! you're not allowed!? Whatever.. I'll deal with it.  Alright, so I'm an Archer and I need a Bow and some Arrows or i'm not going to last very long out here! I opened my crafting menu (and simultaneously close my minimap) and craft a bow. Neat! Now lets get a TON of wood so i can make a hefty supply of ammo. Hmm.. I guess i'll start off with 50 Arrows, that sounds like a nice round number. Crap! i clicked 51 times by accident. that's okay, but wait.. i apparently didn't have enough wood to make 51 arrows so I ended up clicking on the next craftable recipe in the list, which happened to be a wooden wand. 'Oh, neat, i'll try out this wand, and it if it doesn't cut it, i'll just use all those arrows I made'.. but nope! all my arrows were gone. This was just the last straw. I just grew more and more frustrated as i tried to play this game. I wasn't going to wait any longer to find out that there were multiple other bugs this game had to offer me, I immediately closed it out and asked for a refund. Yes, i only played for 13 minutes, but I found 3 bugs that just completely ruined the game for me within that time. I can't imagine what else i would have encountered if I had continued playing. And i wasn't going to waste my time or my money doing so.  This game looked really awesome and I sat on my hands for a few days deciding whether or not to buy it. I waited for more reviews to roll in and today I finally said 'What the hell!' but now i'm left here saying 'What the hell??'  Proceed at your own risk.",
