Every level is unique and brings a new qwirk to play on, from deathballs that follow you around to cameras constantly changing direction. The game also has a great sense of humor, and the text that guides you through the levels is never not funny. The controls are tight and never feel like a burden. Overall you should at least play the game once, it is highly recommended.",

I reccommend not watching any gameplay as it will give away some of the jokes and surprises. If you like puzzels and whitey/sarcastic humor this is a game for you.  P.S If you try to 100% this game you will lose your sanity due to the challenge...just a quick warning  ",

The game, as well as it's messages throughout the game, are plainly punishing and insulting. Usually I don't play into the cards of dickish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by reacting to their BS but you can't always be silent about such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or else these mofos think they've won.   The game itself is moderately challenging, up to the extent of demanding close to perfect mastering/exploiting the mechanics when it comes to getting all stars on the time attack tracks. The mechanics during regular levels range from simple over ♥♥♥♥ move to clever. It's like putting gummibears, toblerone and good old guano in a blender serving it with spoons made from razor blades while offering you some fresh squeezed lemon juice which you have to do on your own.   tl;dr: steer clear of this BS and watch a playthrough instead, get the entertainment for free without being taunted for buying/playing their game. Seriously, playing with these balls yourself isn't all it's cracked up to be.",

The design is simple, but slick and every level introduces new elements or uses the traps and obstacles in a different way.  If you don't care about completion or speedrunning, the main campaign isn't that long, but there is an level editor included. The soundtrack is fitting and at least some of the jokes were quite funny.  If you are likely to be only interested in the main campaign, I would recommend waiting for a discount though.  ",
