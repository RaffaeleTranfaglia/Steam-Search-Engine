            "review_text": "One of many Pajama Sam games I never played as a child.  This was lacking a few things: same bgm alternations throughout the game--pretty lack-a-daisy, the voice casting for lightning was a bit disappointing than what I imagined, game didn't feel that all engaging overall unlike the first one. Title was a bit misleading along with the prologue, thought it was to go against Thunder and LIghtning, like going after Darkness in the first game, not help them... then again...  Still, that's just minor things, and I'm being a bit nit-picky.  Still a good game for kids; they may not get much of the jokes or references right off the bat. Learn a few things about weather and how it works, along with a bit of economics... although that's very boring stuff so leave that to the carrot and the board of directors to discuss amongst themselves.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish.",

            "review_text": "If you would dare to look at Pajama Sam 2 and say to yourself, 'Well, it's a sequel, it can't be quite as good,' you need to immediately rethink all of your life decisions and then play Pajama Sam 2. While there are some slight changes here and there to keep the game feeling fresh, Pajama Sam 2 is packed with all the distinct features that made the first game so amazing: more pointing and clicking, more item collecting and more existential journeys of self-discovery. Instead of collecting socks, Sam collects a large variety of puzzle pieces, which is likely symbolic of the courage and morality he must piece together in order to confront his crippling fear of thunder and lightning. Speaking of puzzles, Pajama Sam 2 is like a puzzle with every piece in its proper place: with its moving story, well-crafted characters and exciting gameplay, this game feels incredibly polished and complete. Throughout its development, the geniuses at Humongous Entertainment must have known they had a masterpiece on their hands.  If I had to give this game a score, I would give it a 10/10 with a complimentary smiley face.  ",

In order to accomplish his goal he goes to his attic to 'visit' the weather company high up in the clouds. Upon his visit, he accidently causes all of the weather machines to malfunction and the fate of the weather conditions of the world rests upon Sam. Like the first game, it's a simple point and click adventure that is very easy to navigate. The characters in this installment are very lively and very appealing to look at. I can just imagine the creative process for these games. The jokes are very clever and will guarantee that you will laugh at least once upon one playthrough. While there's plenty of areas to click on to entertain you for hours. If you love the first game, then this one is a must buy. Kids as well as adults will favor this game as a great sequal to one of Humongous Entertainment's most popular characters.",
