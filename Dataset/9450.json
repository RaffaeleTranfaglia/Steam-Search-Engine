            "review_text": "I wont discuss the mechanics or the diversity. Look to the other comments for that ♥♥♥♥. I am simply giving a story and some true as Khorne is bloodthirsty observations. As I begin remember that in the future, there is only war. One must choose his battlecry well. For the Greater Good.  One of the best RTS games out there. Nothing quite beats some of the moments the game brings on. The following is a part of a game I did (in skirmish) against the ai with 6 bots vs just my ai partner and I:  As I looked at my minimap, I realized my buddy's base was quickly getting overwhelmed. His outer defenses were obliterated not a few minutes ago, and yet the enemy was closing in around his HQ. He was building guardsmen as quickly as he could but the onslaught of orks, chaos space marines, and necrons were too much. His commander made a valiant last stand, but it was in vain...I was then alone.  I scrutinized my defenses and realized I was lacking. I quickly built many turrets as my first line of defense with some space marines around a pass that funneled the enemy forces down and caused them to lose some of the advantage of numbers. My second line were multiple heavy tanks with melee infantry further behind the pass. The purpose of this line was a bullet magnet while my base spit out as many units as I could for a heroic last stand. The third line was whoever else was left at the time the other two lines fell. As I checked my units upgrades and made sure they had all they could have, then I saw a red tide on the minimap. I realized the Emperor would be seeing us soon in the next life.  As the enemy forces through themselves at the turrets, I couldn't help but realize the corpses of the dead. The game has an option that leaves almost all the corpses on the field, and I recommend to turn it on to the max as it adds satisfaction to the price your men are paying. The turrets and supporting infantry could only hold on for so long. Before the line was breached I was in about a 7:1 kd ratio. After the line was broken, it became a 1:1. I zoomed in close for a final look at these men, and I grinned for I knew we would all be joining him soon. The second line held for about half the time. The third and final line consisted of my commander and everyone else that had not died. I waited until the enemy was within weapon's range, then I lit them up with artillery, orbital strikes, and the last two flyers I had. Then, my men charged. They went down valiantly with many enemies dead in the process.   I knew there was no chance for victory from the very beginning, but I watched as my commander made his final defiant yell, I was sad there was never a chance. I was fighting for time, and I got a lot of time. We fought until the final drop of blood was spilt, until the final breath was exhaled, until the fat ♥♥♥ ho sang, until the bitter end.   These are the moments that define gaming, not the scripted ones that everyone encounters, but the ones that are player-made. The game modes where the goal is to kill the enemy commander, and you are completely surrounded on all sides and you make a final charge to kill him to gain victory, and you see your numbers fall from 30 to 23 to 14 to 6 until all you have left is two guardsmen (they die sooooooo easily) and a tank that has a third of its health left and you win. You win against all the odds, and you smirk at the trail of the men that died for victory. I cannot tell you of all the awesomeness that is this game. Go get it.  IN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FAR FUTURE THERE IS ONLY WAR. AND A METRIC ♥♥♥♥ TON (THAT IS A ♥♥♥♥ING MEASUREMENT) OF ENEMY INFANTRY.",

            "review_text": "Do you know when you truly love a game?  When almost 12 years after it's launch, the giddy excitement of running home from work to play it never actually wore off.   Don't let my playtime fool you, I owned the boxed versions of these games loooong before they were in my Steam account and have invested literally THOUSANDS of hours into this game. I was always kind of interested in 40K, having roomates who played the tabletop when I was younger and reading the odd comic here and there, but THIS was the game that turned me into a 40K fanboy and opened me up to the whole universe.  Now before I go any further, if you want the definitive version of Dawn of War for its best balance in both mutliplayer and a better designed single player campaign then buy Dark Crusade. It was the pinnacle of the series.  There are two reasons why I play Soulstorm more than Dark Crusade, the first is that the multiplayer community seems to be much more active on SS than it is on DC, the second and infinitely more important reason is what the games community simply refers to by two letters......UA.  The 'Ultimate Apocalypse' mod for Soul Storm or 'UA' for short, has become the absolute best Warhammer 40k game ever made.   The following are just the things that I personally like about the mod, but doesn't even tip the iceburg for what it encompasses : -expands the maps and removes level caps so the truly epic 40K battles can expand in scope -introduces new races including Inquisition, Chaos Daemons, Tyranids and more... -introduced tons of new untis for exsiting races -new buildings, superweapons and tech trees to explore for all races -better balancing than vanilla for multiplayer -constant updates and new content all the time and of course...... TITANS!!!!  The only thing I can hope for (because lets not kid ourselves, Relic is working on DoW 3) is that they make the next game much more like UA in design and get away from the smaller tactical stuff they did with DoW 2.  All in all this is my favorite game of all time and the first and to date ONLY time I will score a game with a perfect 10/10.   Bravo Relic and the UA team, everyone's got a fave....and you made mine.",

            "review_text": "Compared to Dawn of War - Dark Crusade: + it has two more factions to play as (Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar) + it adds an air unit to all existing factions + it's the latest Dawn of War game, so it comes with the most up to date 'balance patch' for multiplayer - pretty much everything else  The main issue with Soulstorm is, that the developers basically copied the successful campaign mode from Dark Crusade and only made it worse (I assume they didn't spend too much money on this installment anymore). The new commanders, their writing and voice acting is horrible compared to Dark Crusade. I mean the Necron Lord not only *talks* (whereas in DC, the talking was done cleverly by a humanoid hybrid Pariah, the other Necron units remaining almost always silent), he talks like he's got lung cancer. The Space Marines' Boreale lacked so much charisma that they had him canonically killed off after this game. All the other new commanders are basically just copied but worse versions of their Dark Crusade equivalents. The only two exceptions are - the Imperial Guard commander, Vance Stubbs, who's still worse than Alexander from Dark Crusade (especially in terms of voice acting), but at least he's got some character of his own - and the Ork commander, Warboss Gorgutz, because he's the only one returning from Dark Crusade.  But even writing/character/likability/voice acting aside, the campaign is worse in gameplay aspects as well. For some reason, the developers felt the need to 'rebalance' the gameplay portion of the campaign, even though it's single player only. That means that everything got toned down - almost all of the Commanders' best upgrades got nerfed. As if that wasn't enough, defense missions are also extremely painful now. Why? Because in Dark Crusade, all sturctures that you've built in a mission would remain on the map the next time you play. That was mostly to compensate for the fact that you don't start out with your Commander/Honor Guard as you would normally when attacking. In Soulstorm, they removed that, so every single time, all the structures you've built magically disappear from the map after you win. Having to play the same two-three maps over and over and over again on the enemy's turn when he's attacking you, always starting from just your HQ and your stationed units there is incredibly boring and time consuming. And to top it all off, they also nerfed the bonuses you get - there are no longer any specials 'out there' on the map for you to get, only Honor Guard. Some tiny production bonuses are also scattered around the map, but they're not even worth the time, really. Instead, every faction starts with its own special bonus that the others get after conquering their HQ. That sounds like nice balance on paper, but it's not really, since many of the factions start with useless arbirtrary stuff (Tau, Necrons), absolutely worthless stuff (Chaos), while the downright overpowered specials, of course, belong to the Eldar and the Sisters of Battle.  Overall, a good game for what it is, and if you want to play the multiplayer, but if you're looking for a nice single player campaign experience, I'd recommend Dark Crusade instead.",

But as said before, those minor bugs don't affect the gameplay -The Multiplayer is alive, there are more players on this game then on other games of this franchise -The game is repetitive, I have passed couple of campaigns before I have gotten the game on Steam  CONS -Campaign is a bit too hard if you are new to RTS -When you conquer a teritorry, the base you have built does not stay and if you get attacked you will have to expand and upgrade your base again. The basic base buildings will only stay if you have ability Forward Base  I recommend this game. 9/10 would subjugate Kaurava System again!",

            "review_text": "I've played all the Dawn of War expansions and I think this is my favourite. There's two new races (Sisters of Battle and Derk Eldar), and all the exisiting races get an air unit. The use of a conquest campaign (like in Dark Crusade) also help the replayability! I did get the impression that the campaign wasn't as polished (not as many cutscenes) as Dark Crusade but it was still better, largely due to the additional races and more territories.  I'm not a tabletop Warhammer fan, and Dawn of War: Dark Crusade was my first look into the 40k universe, so I don't know how well displayed the races are or anything like that, but as a RTS game this is brilliant. Dark Crusade was so good I went and got the Dawn of War and Dawn of War: Winter Assault on Steam. However, Dark Crusade was my favourite of the three, and Soulstorm is more in the Dark Crusade vein. You have to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of your race and decide what your best tactic is for fighting each different race. So to a degree you have to keep changing up your tactic to suit the battle; I play as the Imperial Guard and my preferred tactic (from Dark Crusade's Annilation maps) is to dig in at first, build up my army and once I've tanks, artillery and infantry, push out and steamroll the enemy. In some maps, you need to take over 50% of the critical locations so I had to adapt my strategy.  All in all, the new races are a fun addition. The air support also lends another depth to the game, while still keeping the Dark Crusade style intact. The conquest campaign with multiple planets also made the grand strategy more important to your conquest plan. I'd definitely reccommend this game, even if you already have Dark Crusade. Also, it's standalone, so even if you don't have any Dawn of War games you can still play it - so get it either way!!  Also, check out  moddb.com  for the Strongholds mod, which lets you play all of the stronghold missions from Dark Crusade and Soulstorm as any race, against any race!",

I had this game on DVD, but now I bought it on steam for 2,49€ which is very cheap, but buying it for a full price here on steam is not something I would recommend you.  Pros: Great gameplay with huge armies No DLC crap Mods  Cons: Graphics feels little outdated  For the best vanilla gameplay experience, a most have mod is 'Soulstorm Bugfix Mod' , this is a small 50mb mod which acts like unofficial patch, no new units or models, it only has bugs fixes and improved AI.

The story might not be as thrilling or entertaining as other RTS games, but who plays RTS games for the cutscenes?  Dawn of War (all of them, but Soulstorm is more worth getting as it has all the races) is definitely the best RTS game i've played, bringing in new aspects of gaining resources and building armies that are absolutely great. Maps are awesome and designed very well, and the units and special abilities will satisfy you greatly. Dawn of War's races can vary very much, with some races such as the Necrons or Dark Eldar having special aspects that are completely alien compared to the other 7 races, so it has a good choice of the style of play that will keep you entertained for hours.   After playing this game for long enough, you'll find yourself quoting the phrases the units say all the time - by far the best being 'WIIIIITNEEEESSS EEYOUR DOOOOOOOMMMMMEE!!!'

I love how the combat is so full on when soldiers are executed outright and your army of Grey Knights take on a squad of Chaos Marines. It really details the sides of 'Good' and 'Evil'. Remarkably the game gives this sense of always being against the odds. I love the feeling of being in a last stand effort to hold the line as you would say, as it really demonstrates how the Human Race is fighting for every planet to the very last man. The game appeals to 'nerds' and even people who have never been into the lore behind most Sci-Fi games. I also like how the game presents the view that in the 40000th century nothing is pleasant and that their is only war for all races in the Warhammer Universe.  The game is diverse, unique in races as well as the units you can fight with and has a great campaign and I advise you to buy the entire Warhammer package that comes with all of the expansions.   9/10. Buy this game for the introduction to a totally new and dystopian universe.",

If you know how to handle yourself and are happy to jump through a few hoops, Install Titanium Wars, If your looking for a ezy install mod go do Ultimate Apocolypse. I won't be reviewing the game itself, there are other reviews for that, and my opinion is frank, Its the best RTS out there next to Starcraft, and not as outragously competative. What I will be doing is compairing the two top teir mods for the game. Ultimate Apocolypse;  Races it adds; Tyranids, Deamons, Ordo malleus Stuff it fixes; Not much (as far as I can see) For unit comparisons I will be using Space Marines, For easy refrence. Apocolypse adds in a selection of units from table top, as well as 2 titans and fair selection of the bigger tanks. However it feels like things are missing For example, specalised heavy weapons squads along with Dreadnaught Mortis. Notes; it is easy to install however it feels like a somewhat paired down version of Titanium Wars Titanium Wars; Races Added; Tyranids, Administratum, Ordo Malleus, Wictch Hunters (Semi-conversion of the Sisters Of Battle to bring them on level) Stuff it Fixes; Removal of unbalanced Air units, AI pathing, Donatioins, and High speed calculations put in, AI is also capable of using the new units to their fullest.  Unit Comparison;  Almost every unit from table top, However against Apoc it only adds 1 titan for balanceing reasons. However it does allow for thing such as thunderhawk deployment of super heavy tanks alongside far more unit customization. Notes; Administratum and Ordo Malleus are huge, they feel like they should and have unique units to themselves, The voice acting isn't amazing (the mod-maker is russian) and installing it is a pain due to a complicated series of events that involved a spat between mod makers.   Conclusion, I would go for Titanium wars, mainly because it has a larger selection of units and it makes some armies playable in multiplayer, However if you are not after balanced and just want to feild the largest army imagenable and do silly things. go for Apocolypse.   In short; Get the game. For The Emperor, For the Dark gods, For the Greater Good, whatever battle cry you so choose, but mod it. get a few friends together, get them the game, get them the mods and proceed to smash titans against each other.",

A new player could dominate with the Space Marines, but it takes true micro and macro mastery to properly handle the Eldar. I find this to be a bonus, since you can pick a weaker race when showing your friends the ropes.   Certain races are excellent counters against others. So DoW lends itself best towards massive team battles between multiple players. Thought 1v1 tends is thrilling, when playing with somone you know well, you will probably both Random. Since your opponent can't see what you have randomed until they scout you. Meaning they can't preempt and counter your most efficient strategy.

Also You would think the Battle Sisters would start on the Chaos/Dark Eldar planet and they shouldn't be fighting the imperial guard because the imperial governer replaced the last one. So the Imperial guard's admistration is competly replaced. These three factions figting each other is illogical. But however the Battle Sisters are extreme religious miltants that kill anyone who isn't a follower of the emperor in their eyes. People would say that they are fighting for the entire system. In the other dlc's and differnt games such as Space Marine the Space Marines and Imperial Guard are always allies unless they are corrupt. But remember the imperial guard Governer has been replaced since the oringnal lost the system to xenos and chaos.   Second con is the difficutly setting on custom battles. On medium the other players are too fast and on easy they are too slow.   Execpt those two negatives I recommend this game, It is very fun and challeging.

The ability to reinforce squads in the field is something I wish more RTS games would use (looking at you Command and Conquer) but alas Relic seem to be the only ones ( that I know of) that understand the iritation of not being able to bring a squad back up to full size without running back to base. 14 bucks for a game that gave me 200+ hours of 60 fps RTS gold. Not bad.",

And in all fairness, if there was one thing I would critique Soulstorm for other than lack of polish, it is occasionally train-wreck level off-kilter VA work.  However, occasional VA disaster aside, I would consider Soulstorm a flawed, yet still highly interesting gem. The campaign system, while no larger than Dark Crusade's, is deeper from the introduction of Webway travel and a better slew of racial bonuses on the campaign map (no more Necrons with Fury nonsense on Turn 1, looking at you, DC) and both the new races are at the least of a different variety to the others in the game with viable differing strategies. The introduction of flyers adds at least in part another element of power-play to the game by acting as an extra combat element on the attack and the defence.   Would I recommend Soulstorm for £40? No. But for the asking price offered, I would absolutely encourage people to round out the DoW 1 collection and see what Soulstorm has to offer. You might be as surprised as me.",

            "review_text": "I've decided to combine the reviews for Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 1, as well as the 3 DLCs: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade and Soulstorm into one macro-review since they all contribute to the tapestry of the Warhammer 40K RTS universe. Because Soulstorm has the most mods available, the most traffic and the most inherent races/features, I will include the Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 1 review within Soulstorm. Please note that my hours on Steam are not indicative of my gameplay hours in DoW 1 (Dawn of War), as I own the retail copies of the main game, as well as all the DLCs. Within the Gamespy network, I logged well over 1250 hours and I was also active within the modding community, working with modders like Thudmeizer on occasion, on mods like Dark Angels, Thousand Sons, Sired by Slaanesh and Minerva Guard. With that said, DoW 1 is an excellent game and a must-have for any Warhammer 40K fan.  If you ask me, however, about what the finest example of real-time strategy (RTS) excellence is, I will quickly and emphatically answer Starcraft 1. That RTS was the first title to introduce a polished, well-designed and properly executed combat system where various races could play asymetrically in a framework of throughtful balance and strategy/tactics. Starcraft 1 had a massive modding community and a dedicated and professional-level competitive ladder. The game had a strong single-player campaign and interesting races that seemed to touch upon all the core tropes of a standard science fiction variety. And yet, despite my rational appreciation for Starcraft 1, my favorite RTS has been and will always be Relic's Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 1.  Apart from having a universe that Blizzard drew from heavily, a cosmic mythos that is inarguably deeper and more detailed than anything Blizzard could offer, Warhammer 40K/DoW 1 also introduced a series of gameplay innovations that produced a paradigm shift that profoundly altered the landscape RTS games. Playing very similarly to Starcraft 1, DoW revolved around the creation and protection of a base and the harvesting of two resource currencies: requisition and energy/power. Much in this way, DoW operates similarly to Starcraft 1 in that a player must create and marshall armies and explore the map that is covered with a fog of war. Once the player has explored the map and assessed all threats, he/she must utilize sound strategies/tactics to destroy/undermine all opponent(s), while simultaneously developing the base and ascending the technology/upgrade ladder.  However, while DoW 1 and Starcraft 1 share common spiritual underpinnings, their similarities end there. Unlike Starcraft 1, DoW 1 has a series of additions that allow it to shine and assume its own unique identity. To begin with, units don't simply mine minerals on deposits around the map but, instead, must capture strategic/valuable points that confer requisition and currency to expand the war machine. These strategic points may often be reinforced but usually exist within hotly-contested, strategically valuable locations and, therefore, the game requires players to not simply build multiple bases, racing wildly to produce the most units and spam a rush but, instead, DoW 1 mandates an adaptive, consistent response to promote success and survival.   In this way, DoW 1 promotes a nuanced and deep gameplay style that encourages the adoption of subterfuge, traps, killzones, turtling and more. Because so many buildings in DoW 1 can be garrisoned or reinforced, base defense is a complex affair that requires forethought and planning. Apart from base building and resource gathering, DoW 1 also adapts the concept of squads. Within Starcraft 1, a player will create 10 units and select them all, thereby creating a squad, wherein he/she can then assign orders to the entire grouping. Within DoW 1, most infantry units already spawn as a member of a squad, consisting of 2-6 units. Squads can be modified, enhanced, upgraded en masse and even reinforced. This paradigm introduces an interesting element where units are thought of members of a cohesive team and where upgrades can be very detailed and nuanced. A single squad may be comprised of various identical units, upgraded in very tactically disimilar ways.  Much like every member of a military platoon will not look identically and carry the same weapon, DoW 1 provides the opportunity to truly customize each member of a squad. Another innovation deals with not only the use of line-of-sight mechanics but also passive cover systems, where units may use the environment to gain bonuses to resist or dodge specific weaponry. Not all weapons are affected by cover and such weapons (like a flamer), may shine in circumstances where an opponent is cowering within a crater, behind a pile of rubble or within a burned-out building. The use of cover is an essential concept within DoW 1 and can produce victory from even the most tactically disparate scenarios, if employed correctly. The use of cover systems also promotes the necessity for melee combat. While many other RTS games, like Starcraft 1, only confer melee capabilities to some units, all non-vehicle units within DoW 1 posses hand-to-hand combat skills.   The importance of 'pinning' and engaging a strong-ranged/weak-melee squad within hand-to-hand combat is an essential concept within DoW 1. Therefore, knowing about your squads and being aware of how they are upgraded is enormously important in order to ensure that all your units are being used to maximal effect. The issue isn't simply that a unit may be 'weak' against melee but that, in fact, they may be substantially, proportionally weaker vs melee units when locked into close-combat. Units that are pinned in close-combat will lose morale and, should their morale break, will flee the battle scene/lose combat effectiveness at best...or simply get slaughtered at worst. Dealing with all of these factors, including squads, cover, melee and morale add a tremendously rich and satisfying layer to traditional RTS gameplay.  As a whole, the DoW 1 games are well, if unspectacularly scripted, and possess extremely competent graphics, combined with wonderful audio elements. Explosions and sprays of gore abound as squads of units smash into one another, desperately attempting to secure a contested spot that will produce the necessary requesition to further their military cause. Death animations are elaborate and further the notion that your armies aren't simply disposable paper dolls but limited...finite champions. However, despite the satisfactory single-player campaigns, DoW 1 really shines during multiplayer, where a variety of modes like annihilation, assassinate, timer, and more allow players to constantly nutate their strategies/tactics.  Unlike most RTSes, DoW 1 has a staggering 9 races to play, ranging from righteous Space Marines from a variety of chapters, diabolical Chaos Space equivalents, the loyal Imperial Guard (human servants of the Emperor), mysterious Eldar, cruel Dark Eldar, feral Orks, the robotic zombie Necrons, japanese-themed Tau and the Adeptas Sororitas: battle nuns. While the theming may seem all over the place, a few minutes at the Warhammer 40K online encyclopedia: Lexicanum will assure almost any discerning gamer about the unbelievable breadth and depth of this venerable franchise's awesome universe. While game balance is good but isn't perfect (Necrons wreck IG too easily for instance), the mod scene for DoW 1 is unbelievably strong and still active 10 years after the initial game's release. And with over 50 amazing mods to choose from, DoW 1 provides almost unending value after a quick trip to the Relic Forums or Moddb. Modders have produced an almost undending variety of new races, AI additions, environmental effects, incredible graphical upgrades and complete gameplay overhauls. Truly, the game value is astronomical.  For WH40K/RTS fans: 9.5/10 and 9/10 for everyone else.",
