            "review_text": "Very nice combination of Terraria and Lemmings. I definitely recommend, it's very casual, relaxing and enjoyable game with nice graphics, sounds and music.  Cons: - AI need some work, the way how AI select which dwarf do what is crappy, very annoying thing is to order dwarves to attack enemy, seems AI just remember the destination and until dwarves reach it, they ignore anything (aka other enemies on the way, or even that enemy if he moves, dwarves just keep running &gt;&lt;); - Some things are not easy to discover and they definitely needs to be in tutorial with a good explanation: deconstructing, farm + trap, comfort level, professions... - AI basic control of dwarves is not the best one, it would be much better to select dwarf and give him an order (or even set of orders), portal spell is a good way to set priority (because dwarves always choose the job close to stock and portal 'move' that point to stock in reachability). - Some predefinition are wrong or missing clear hints: level at which tree grows, at which snow falls, at which anything grows in cave. Digging one tile lower and suggenly you have no more resource (as wood or grown food) to replenish. E.g. different earth color placed by player could indicate that. - Grow rate is broken and annoying: tree may keep instantly grow at place where previous one was chopped, preventing that peace from digging, there must be a delay at given tile after removing resource from it, will it be a tree, bush, mushroom, crystal, etc. - Teleport spell should cost 1 mana and last longer, this is the only right way in the game to travel. On large map it become very annoying to move dwarves back/forth (it take too long to travel), elevator is bugged, train is not reliable and required investments (inculuding time), which not worth it. - Even after finishing game I have NO CLUE how many resources can one dwarf pick up or what 100 archery does. Tooltip and ingame help is way too casual. - Balance issue (archery is the only way to go, melee makes health management more intense, while magic is simply not reliable), swarms of enemies required escaping until tesla tech, then BAM, they are not a problem anymore at all suddenly and further gameplay become less intense (and more boring).  Pros: - It's simply beauteful game with variaty of activities. - Company, while consists from only 4 maps is in fact quite a long journey: every map is different, brings something new and each map took for me 30+ hours (!) to finish.",

Then its back to square one more or less because there is no save function!!  Fix a saving option!  Still recommended though because it IS great fun and has potential.",

The AI is pretty good, and they usually do a great job going where you tell them to, and taking the best routes. They're very responsive too.   There are a ton of things to craft and learn how to build, along with a ton of materials to discover. The enemies can be very dangerous at times ( e.g. during waves).   The controls are not very intuitive at first, but once you catch on it's pretty easy.",

For anyone who is thinking about buying it but still is kind of wondering what its about and what the game will bring, let me give you a basic rundown of my experiance with the game. I am currently 46 hours and 23 minutes in and im just beggining to bring my world to life. There is endless amounts of things to do and in this game no matter what you do theres always a way to expand onto what you already did. The monsters are very creative and at 46 hours and 23 minutes in they are not to be taken lightly. So really to anyone thinking of buying it, it is well worth the 19 dollars or however much it is when you are reading this.",

One of my all time favorite games.. Serioulsy. Probably the best $18.99 i have spent on an early access game. Highly reccomended for people who enjoy bossing little people around.

I have very few complaints about this game but here they are: - Gnomes sometimes fall through the floor if you are changing the shape of a wall piece they are standing on and they are unable to path their way out ofthe hole, you have to take control of that dwarfand jump out, quickly fix the hole and hope that another dwarf doesnt find his way in there while you are switching the block (pausing works but takes just as long to pause the game as it does to fix the hole) - Playing without the tech tree can leave you without some of the basic crafted materials until late in the game. I didnt get the recipe for clay untill after my dwarfs were decked out in silver armor and weapons. - There does not seem to be enough ore to go around in the small worlds, I found myself mining huge swaths of the underground to find a few pieces of iron or silver to finish an item  On the plus side, this game was worth every cent og the $18.99 I paid for it. Craft the world fits every expectation I have for a crafting/simulation game and it stands strong where others have fallen short.  - The game play is easy to learn and the in game tutorials hold your hand at the begining but then let you run free when you are ready  - The Gnomes do a great job of collecting every single piece of material left behind, sometimes it takes a while if you have dug a huge hole, cut down a bunch of trees, and purchased some stuff from the shop. The dwarf's carrying capacity is very limited and carrying 3 leaves is the same to them as carrying 3 chunks of stone but they get the job done eventually. Sometimes you just have to sit back and watch them scurry around or use one of the magic spells to help them along. The portal and imp spells work great for gathering large amounts of material left in one place.",

You take charge of a growing squad of dwarves, and give them tasks as needed, in order to make the world a nice place for a clan of dwarves to settle. But enemies will also come for your kingdom, so take the time to prepare. You can either just give orders and sit back, or you can get your own hands dirty by taking control of any individual dwarf for certain tasks.  The game has a lot of replay value. The first campaign, at a fairly normal pace but trying to explore most of the world, took about 25 to 30 hours. Graphics are simple and cutesy, but still quite pretty and functional for what the game is trying to do. The crafting tree is robust, with a lot of functional and cosmetic items. Though, even cosmetic items are functional in a way, given how the dwarves' resting mechanic works.  The only real drawback to this game comes when you gather quite the party of dwarves (over 10). Then, the dwarven AI individually tends to compete, and they start to derp in frustrating ways. You'll see 2 or 3 dwarves competing for a single task and getting waylaid on the other side of portals if you don't micromanage certain tasks. Too, sometimes dwarves will fail their tasks for no apparent reason, or plain not recognize their task. Fortunately, you can (usually) clear this problem by taking control of a dwarf and/or immediately releasing him.   All in all, the game is fully worth the $20 it was at regular price. If you catch it on a Steam sale, you'll do even better. For lovers of simpler real-time strategy, with mining/crafting elements, building, and some battling!",

Some thoughts:  Good AI on the dwarfs, 90% did what I expected when I expected it.  UI could do with some work. Grindy tech tree. Drags a little near the end of the first map, need virtually EVERY resource available to complete the map. Some resources are finite so dont go crazy making more than you need. Using the healing pots in combat is a pain ( open equip window, scroll thro all dwarfs to see injuries, rclick health pot, use, repeat up to 3 times per dwarf. Repeat every 10-15 seconds depending on armor equipped). Satisfying gaining, building and then using tech. (elevators, mine trucks, lightning towers) Not satisfying realising the tech is pretty obselete with the spells you have... (teleport, fireballs etc)  I managed to snag it 50% off, but it would have been a bargain regardless. Happy to recommend.",

I really enjoy commanding dwarves to carve out through the depths of the underground. After I first bought the game, my first reactions were 'This looks so very nice!', 'Wait... There are only    three    worlds?' and 'Holy crap this tech tree!' After my first 5+ hours I started to understand the games mechanics. Really easy to download and play, plus there is a tutorial, that is skippable when you start a new world. Now the problems I have with the game. Right around the middle of the tech tree, I find myself having to grind along. Most of that is because of a need for wool. The developers remedied this by adding traps and farms to maintain sheep. Unfortunately, both the farm fences and the trap require rope, which is made with wool, to make. Also, the AI for the dwarves still needs a little work. Often they will not pick up the resources I need and instead gather around tables for chats. That being said, the AI is not bad by any means. Recently there was an update that did help fix this. I have had a problems with occasional minor lag spikes and my saves corrupting if my computer bluescreens, which is not the developers fault. The fault lies with GeForce producing terrible cards ( and Nvidia producing updated ♥♥♥♥ drivers for older cards. Definitely worth $20. I would buy it again at that price, and an even better value if bought cheaper.   Pros: -The games art style -Large tech tree -Large maps -Personally control one dwarf at a time -Wide spectrum of enemies  Cons: -Grind, grind, grind -minor lag spikes  Bottom line: I would definitely buy this again and I would completely recommend this game for any of my friends.",

The second stage is markedly more difficult but you do get new recipes that you did not get in stage one.

            "review_text": "I reccomend this game but only in some circumstances.  It's a fine game, its well made, the art is nice, graphics are vibrant and the gameplay and crafting systems are pretty in depth. The crafting system is especially well made and is probably the highlight. I've seen some people say its hard to control the Dwarfs and it is and isn't at the same time. Early game its easy to get your dwarfs moving in one direction. Late game once you get vast chasms of mines and tunnels you'll be tearing your hair out when goblins suddenly spawn next to your house while all your dwarfs but 2 or 3 are away in the tunnels. There are some useful presets you can give to your dwarfs to perform certain jobs, the lite RPG elements are neat and give serious benefits to highly leveld dwarfs for their jobs but it becomes damn near impossible to keep track of everything and keep all your dwarfs on the same page after your population hits 20 or 30.   The crafting is neat. You start you gathering resources and clearing tunnels and land. You develop a nice plot to place a house on and keep your dwarfs slept and fed and then you go from there progressively upgrading and improving your tools, armor, weapons and workbenches. The crafting system has a fairly deep system but it still didn't seem deep enough to keep me interested late game. After so long it became more of a stalemate and i couldn't keep up nor could i dig far enough and build enough ladders to get to the best ores. At this point i lost interest since i was more or less in a slogging grind and was making little to no progress. To some that may be part of the fun, and it is for me usually, but the crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me grinding. Since crafting is one of the main, if not the main, selling points of this game that can be a hit or miss depending on who you are or what you like. I'd recommend it to people who can get this game on the cheap and enjoy cartoony games with lots of charm and a neat little twist on the craft/survive genre.   Its got a bit of Minecraft, Terraria and a bit of RTS-RPG like Warcraft 3. It has good charm from your dwarfs and some of the enemies you battle. It has vibrant colors with clean, well made graphics that fit the atmosphere and gameplay perfectly. And finally the sound design and quality are pretty top notch for an indie game or Mobile port (not sure if this is a mobile port but it seems like one).   Pros  -Vibrant Colors and Graphics. Very clean and pretty. -Nice sounds and music. Helps keep the charm of the game up during play. -Charm. This game has a good amount of charm, atleast to me. -RPG elements. It has several layers and types of RPG elements -Crafting system. Its fairly easy to understand, a bit convoluted but has decent depth. -RTS elements with individual characters having their own equipment slots. -Many different jobs and noticable changes to productivity from job skills leveling up.  Cons -Turns into a grind late game. -Crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me interested late game or long term. -Some enemies seem very annoying, the goblins especially. -The game is good in many different facets but doesn't really excell at any one in specific. -Somewhat convoluted design to mages and some crafting recipes. -A slight learning curve, especially for those new to the genre. -Some of the items and furniture seem useless and arbitrary.  Thats about it. Its good little game. I feel it was worth the price. I think i payed $7.50 or $10 for it and i got a nice, enjoyable 10 hours out of it. I'll probably come back a few months down the line to give it another play through because the game does have a lot of charm to me despite its flaws. Its a, for the most part, technically solid game that was better than i'd expected. I think it deserves a buy if you're into Terraria/Starcraft, Minecraft and other games of that ilk. I wouldn't reccomend it on its RPG-RTS elements alone but they blend together well with the survival/craft elements to make a rather enjoyable and worthwhile game, even if its worth wasn't that long for this one guy.",

There are a lot of items available to craft and different types of materials that can be used to build shelter. You can build traps and automated turrets, equip your dwarves with different weapons and teach them different skills using books. The goal of the game is to kill 5 guardians and rebuild the portal to the next world. There are 3 different worlds available (normal, ice, desert) with different creatures, weathers, resources and a few specific items available only in this world.  After 30 hours of gameplay on a larger size map the game becomes a bit boring. Dwarves move slowly, mana regenerates slowly (so you cannot be using portal spell too often), maximum speed of the game is x2 (I play on max speed 95% of time). There are a few minor bugs, but they don't prevent from enjoying the game - sometimes item cannot be removed from a quick access bar or dwarves behave as if their IQ dropped to one digit number. Quick access bar at the beginning seems quite small but you get used to it (and there is another one available by pressing ctrl). There is no loading a save game - game autosaves, so when you exit you come back to what you built, hence it is not possible to undo mistakes (other than to copy save files to another directory and then bring them back).  I don't remember a game released in the past few years which would be so cheap and which I would play so long - this game is definitely worth this £14.00.  I am looking forward to see some other means of transport like horses, increased maximum game speed to x5 or x10 and normal game save/load system.",

You create everything from armour, weapons, furniture, food and potions with the ultimate goal of opening a portal to the next level. The game worlds are not as large as Terraria and the limited metals make it impossible to fully equip your dwarves in the best armour and equipment except on the larger maps.   Unlike Terraria you don’t directly control a single character but instead issue commands which the dwarves then carry out, this allows you to queue large construction projects or mine huge areas and simply sit back and watch the dwarves complete the tasks. You can construct various defences which allow you to automate your defence, I found this part of the game the most enjoyable as your hard mining and crafting is eventually awarded with a base your enemies can’t breech.   On the negative side the game suffers from strange path finding issues, sometimes dwarves stand motionless with an icon above their head indicating that they can’t find a way to get to a location. It’s understandable when the location is miles away but as you mine and create complex tunnel systems they become more frequently lost even when going a short distance. It’s also a shame that nothing carries over to the next level. You open a portal to the next map but you start that map with nothing. ",

The tutorial (missing in other things I've tried and given up on) was just right to get me going on how the concept works.    I love how the night brings in monsters to combat - but not so severe as you die on night one! I can feel myself getting better and better at crafting the right tools and arming my little guys ready for the onslaught (love the countdown to the hoard of nasties). Sometimes my little guys ddon't go the way I want and manual control is a bit tedious - but to be able to control my whole game just with a single point and click device means I can keep 3 limbs under a winter blanket and play whilst snuggled up.   As a starter game this has been great and I can see how there is potential to up my skill and get more out of the game as an advancing player. Nothing negative to say about it really - can't wait to see what the future updates bring.",

It's an interesting amalgam of the two games, though not nearly in-depth and strategic as DF, and lacking the insane quantity of content of Terraria. If the developer maintains a level of involvement half that of the Terraria dev, this game has huge potential.   As it stands right now, early game discovery is a superb experience. Mid-game, you focus on building yourself up and reaching higher tech levels. I haven't made it to end-game content yet, but I hear it's lacking.  Bottom line, do I recommend it? Hellz yeah. And $10 is an excellent price point for this game. In hindsight I would have purchased it at full price, but I had no idea it would be this good.",

Is there going to be a similar update for ios? Soon?? I do also have some suggestions and critisisms for this game.   The AI/pathing needs some serious attention. Giving more control over the dwarves. I find it frustratingly difficult to get them to do what i want. I get the concept of not having direct control or having to micro manage the dwarves, but I want more control. Don't let this concept get in the way of developing a great game that people want to keep playing. I want to be a god not an annoying arrow pointer that tries to direct the path. If you need more money to develop, I would not be opposed to buying cheap dlc for new worlds with quircky little themed challenges. Bring em on (ipad)! Or even a world editor/creator.  The market could also use some updating. maybe trading with other worlds that we have created. I spend too much time mining gold coins to buy health potions so i can survive each wave. I like the challenge of the waves and i like the countdown timer so i can prepare.  I also find the traps and farming aspects of the game specifically ineffective, boring and useless. Herding sheep for wool, however is useful, but too time consuming. We should also be able to herd other beasts for meat and hides relatively easier. Traps are useless and non existent in my strategies to defend against the waves. Once i finally get the dwarves to place the trap it is destroyed before it even does anything and i have to wait and hopefully survive the wave before i can regather the trap then place them all again...it was a frustrating and useless strategy...please fix that. I like the concept of the tesla thing but it needs to be more powerfull, and maybe an ice or fire cannon or something. Amp up the tower defence aspect of the game a little.  I am not by any means trying to discourage people from getting this game. You should definately get it. Support the developers, because they are on to something with this game. It takes almost all of my favorite game genres and puts them all into one promising game! Overall this game is great, but it could be awesome if the developers keep going with it...on ipad especially!",

On one side, the fundamental gameplay just keeps on giving. The core design of this game really shines for the management genre.  Then there are three 'turn-offs' on the opposite side:  1. Bugs, pre-and-post patches. 2. Gameplay does not scale well with play time. 3. Lack of attachment.   Replayability:  Believe it or not, this is where both the blessing and the curse begins...  The replay value is really high, extremely so.  But every time when I start a new game, I fear I will feel the same emptiness upon reaching certain play time.  Then I tell myself, that, I will just start a new game upon feeling the same emptiness...",

There is more then meets the eye here and planning your shelter and redesign it as you progress is both fun and rewarding. I only played custom games so far and even if the endgame tend to drag out a bit on large maps I didn't feel like it was to bad and never lacked resources for long. (Lucky perhaps?)  What could be improved is the AI that can from time to time drive you nuts when the dwarfs do one stupid thing after another, there could be improvements to be made with tooltips and make it more obvious what armor stats your dwarfs have when you equip better gear. Other thing is that the tech tree could be tuned a bit to make it a bit more interesting and some techs should be moved to a earlier spot in the tech tree to match your progress as you need to expand and go further away from the shelter (elevator, secondary storages and railtracks for example) .   I would also love to see some more options for defending your shelter, like more turrets, burning oil, perhaps a drawbridge.   If you are into sandbox games and enjoy perfecting your castle and exploring the landscape around it you should be quite happy with this game, it got much to offer even though there are room for improvements.",

You may get very frustrated with it, though, depending on your preferred style of play.    I'm not fond of playing castle defense games, probably because I get easily flustered under time pressure. When I first tried the campaign in Craft the World, I nearly deleted it in frustration: the waves of enemies never gave me enough time to learn how to play the game.   Luckily, you can control the difficulty (and number of waves) in a sandbox game. So for those who are more casual players, who like to dig deep into how a game works, or who aren't used to castle defense games, Craft the World still has lots of fun to offer.   The developers have put a lot of effort into the game: the graphics, sound, and music are polished, the monsters are interesting and varied, the items/recipes are extensive (and frequently even logical), and they've clearly devoted a lot of time to the dwarf AI.   The dwarf AI quality is mixed: On the one hand, the dwarves have some stupid behaviors, and don't handle large amounts of commands well. On the other hand, when I took the time to learn the ins and outs of how they act, I found their behavior predictable, and could usually find a game mechanic that would allow me to control the behaviors I didn't want.",

            "review_text": "So I picked this game up in the Steam Summer Sale a week-ish ago and I've played almost a full day of it as I'm writing this review. This game is really addicting if you ever enjoyed things like Dwarf Fortress, or other village builder games such as Rim World, the controls are pretty hands off for most tasks, click a block and a dwarf will wander over and mine it, click an enemy and your colony will rush over and bash, slash, hack, and shoot it until it dies or they get too low on health and have to run away. If you want a ton of fine tuned controls and exceptional AI then this is not the game for you, however.  For the full run down here we go Pros   Dwarves   Decent structure building   AI is usually smart enough to have your dwarves get out of fatal situations   Once you craft an item once you can quick craft it by just clicking at the bottom of the interface   The Totem and dwarves finally tell you how in the heck to make a structure be valid housing for dwarves as of the update this morning (I had a lot of issues my first game because dwarves refuse to sleep in beds and heal if the structure isn't complete)   Enemy variety is surprisingly good, compared to something like Minecraft where you have 5 passive creatures, and maybe 7 hostile ones that aren't bosses and the number of enemy types in this game are astounding, I already have 40 pages in my bestiary and I've only played the first level and run through Biomes   Multiplayer can be great fun, but even the co-op mode isn't really working in tandem most of the time  Cons   Dwarves are notoriously bad swimmers, this can lead to them drowning at random if it rains for too long in the game, shut your doors during storms or you may have a bad time   The actual tutorial in the game doesn't tell you much at all beyond basic controls and how to access menus, with a brief dip into crafting, I've played almost an entire 24 hours and I still can't figure out how to make a farmhouse actually do anything and planting crops is a task you can get within the first hour of playing   Speaking of tasks, it tells you almost nothing about how to complete them most of the time, it gives you a general idea of what you need to do and no actual steps with a few of them being exceptions outside of the ones tied to the tech tree   Dwarves are ocassionally dumber than a box of rocks, trapping themselves on ladders, refusing to go through doors, and sometimes being fatally stupid and standing completely still while being shot with arrows and magic and they don't even have the will to die fighting and at least shoot back   Fall damage is very unforgiving and with early tech levels nearly impossible to prevent as the early bridge that you get access to they can still fall off of, this has caused a handful of deaths so far by just watching dwarf after dwarf try to walk across the flat bridge and plummet to their deaths... I don't even have alcohol for them yet, come on game   Multiplayer just feels like a resource grab*   Dwarves dying in the multiplayer due to a poor generation causes them to still be dead in your singleplayer world, and they cannot take any gear whatsoever with them to the multiplayer session, so sometimes you just get all your dwarves rolled because you get a really low resource start and they get out-geared by the enemies and your high level dwarves are sometimes just gone, nothing you can say or do about it without being really far into the tech tree   The DLC that just came out, Sisters in Arms, is a ton of Quality of Life changes, and giving you dwarves that have a bit less HP, but a lot more speed, then it adds in a few new items, namely shields   A player with the DLC and a player without the DLC seem to have issues with multiplayer as since this morning any time I've spent in multiplayer if the other person has had female dwarves the game inevitably loses connection within a couple minutes   The inventory can sometimes become really clogged since (as far as I know) you can't sell or trash unwanted items, this has lead me to have a stockpile of 12 wooden clubs laying around 'just in case' while my dwarves are armed and armored to the teeth in silver and gold gear  *This is getting rather long now, but this section is going to be devoted entirely to the multiplayer portion of the game, so if you don't care about that then skip this and read the last words on the game.  The multiplayer game mode is not at all what I was expecting from a survival/town builder style game, in fact large portions of it don't make any sense at all. Your two modes are PvP and Co-operative, only support for two players regardless of mode, the goal of PvP is kill the other person's dwarves, the goal of Co-operative is... well I'd love to tell you, but it fluctuates based on the biome and sometimes seems like it has no real goal, it just ends when it feels like it.   In the cons earlier one of them was that multiplayer feels like a resource grab and well, at least with the co-operative mode that's all it is. You go to a world where all of the techs are unlocked, resources are all over the place, and the end goal in theory is to kill a big bad boss somewhere deep underground. I say in theory because you never actually have to kill the thing in the standard biome, you can just sneak into its lair and break the loot chest and without another word the session just ends, it totals up the score of the players and you go back to your world. One of the biomes has a bunch of goblin tribes, you'd think that the goal is wiping out all the goblins and taking the loot, but in reality the game can end as soon as a player destroys just a single building and picks up the rewards, leaving sometimes 3/4 of the map completely untouched and a ton more tribes left to raid, but again it just... ends. Other than one game that I played with my girlfriend I've had a grand total of one game where the other player actually even acknowledged my existence, and it was to say a bunch in Russian (I think, it looked like Russian characters, but I don't actually know Russian, so I could be very wrong) then ask me repeatedly for iron. The co-operative mode is less 'work together to overcome a challenge' and more 'hoard as many loose resources as you can while still completing the objective well enough to take it all back with you because anything crafted gets left behind'. The PvP mode also seems like a really bad idea to even attempt because if your dwarves die they're dead, they're just gone unless your singleplayer world is far enough in that you can create the soul catcher and consistently make ressurection potions to keep your high level combat oriented dwarves alive.  If this was purely a review about the multiplayer then I would say not recommended in a heartbeat, the multiplayer is confusing, it effectively just splits the map in half and wants you to ravage the landscape for as much as you can get before the game either ends at random because the other player killed/looted the right thing, or you got bored and killed/looted the right thing. You take any and all basic crafting materials with you, as well as any proper money, and it just drops you back in singleplayer more often than not with a new pile of resources that you probably don't have the tech to use, because the first 1/4 of the tech tree doesn't even get you past using iron, and it suggests that you play the multiplayer (Where literally every item in the game is unlocked mind you) within the first hour or two of playing if you follow the tutorial, which is before you even start farming and fishing, let alone trying to use gold, silver, mithril, and sulphur.    I put recommended because yes, the singleplayer can be very fun, the multiplayer can be too, but the two of them together does cause some discord. I bought the game for less than 4$ but the game is easily worth the 19$ if you like city management/survival games. DLC is questionable.  ",

            "review_text": "tl;dr - Craft the World is a well-put-together game with lots to do and many ways to play. You may get very frustrated with it, though, depending on your preferred style of play.    I'm not fond of playing castle defense games, probably because I get easily flustered under time pressure. When I first tried the campaign in Craft the World, I nearly deleted it in frustration: the waves of enemies never gave me enough time to learn how to play the game.   Luckily, you can control the difficulty (and number of waves) in a sandbox game. So for those who are more casual players, who like to dig deep into how a game works, or who aren't used to castle defense games, Craft the World still has lots of fun to offer.   The developers have put a lot of effort into the game: the graphics, sound, and music are polished, the monsters are interesting and varied, the items/recipes are extensive (and frequently even logical), and they've clearly devoted a lot of time to the dwarf AI.   The dwarf AI quality is mixed: On the one hand, the dwarves have some stupid behaviors, and don't handle large amounts of commands well. On the other hand, when I took the time to learn the ins and outs of how they act, I found their behavior predictable, and could usually find a game mechanic that would allow me to control the behaviors I didn't want.",

I rarely had to budget my resources, which actually detracted from the game. In short, the game needs balancing.  With tha being said, I beat all four levels of the game and really enjoyed myself right up to the end. I found the graphics enjoyable as well as the crafting system--though it is very linear.

The game itself feels looks alot like Terraria but plays alot differently. The best way I would describe it is that Terraria is an RPG where you level up and improve your character as you explore, mine, gather and build, whereas this game is more like an RTS where you control multiple dwarves to mine, gather and build. As you level up in Craft the World you get an additional dwarf that can carry out commands, as well as use equipment to increase his armor, damage, gathering speed and some other abilities as well. The more dwarves you have the faster you will be able to build, mine, gather and defend your base. Base defense is important as every 45 minutes monster portals will spawn somewhere outside and nearby your home which will pour monsters into the world for the remainder of the night (the portal always opens at the beginning of a night) to cause havoc for your dwarves and the fortress you're building for them. The game also offers many different monsters which you'll find in the world, from Goblins to Guardians, that will make you scour your world and fill it with an intricate series of tunnels and mineshafts.  I would like to share some suggestions to improve this game to make it a 5/5: -Add a way to break down items for materials, more crafting recipes that use them, or a way to delete items; inventory in the late game is cluttered with early items you have no use for -Add improved bow towers that use second and third level bows, and have stone and iron bodies that also improve their durability -Add more shops to the worlds which may be harder to find but sell items like equipment, and maybe some unique items that can't be crafted.  -Add a third level portal as a final-tier tech that you allows you to build multiple portals that your dwarves can teleport between -Some way for dwarves to fly short distances, perhaps a helicopter backpack as a late game tech, I think that would look awesome :P",

Lack of fast shafting options and progressive mining. You can't order your dwarfs to dig down and also set up a ladder on the way. Having this feature would've been really practical as it would speed up management. It would also be nice to have the opportunity to mine out from the ground layer by layer vertically to avoid having to set up platforms to make it faster.    The 'Sisters in Arms'-DLC is sort of a slap in the face. It would be nice to have a game where women can exist without having to pay extra. I get that the devs need some way of supporting themselves, but it would be nice if their additional funding didn't involve them literally selling access to digital women in a game (that also have different stats than their male counterparts!).    The crafting system is pretty lame. There's no production line that has to be managed, only potentially creating of tools. To craft things, you open up a Minecraft-like crafting window, drop things in and them you'll be able to skip that process for subsequent crafts by auto-inserting items. This also means that crafts are instant the moment you have the resources in the stockpile.    Dwarves falling off platforms for no apparent reason.    How food works in this game still eludes me.

I really like the base mechanics of the game. You don't control your people individually, but rather tell them what to do and they'll get to it eventually. This can lead to annoyance as things can become high priority to you and your people continue to do the other 'housekeeping' tasks you've set. I could be wrong, but as far as I know, there's no way to increase priority of tasks. That's definitely a problem.  The other thing is that even on the 'fastest' setting, the game gets boring waiting for your dwarves to complete their tasks (even if they immediately jump on them), especially early on when you only have 1-2 dwarves and basic equipment. I know it's kind of supposed to feel like that early on, but this is too much. I'm just staring at the screen waiting far too often.  Also, there is a time box constantly counting down. Every 30 or so minutes (15 I think on the fastest setting), a large group of mobs attack your people. They aren't generally too difficult to defeat, but it does absolutely require your attention. I like the feature, but not ALL the time. This is a crafting game, primarily, and the demographic that likes crafting and building usually doesn't like constant distractions. We want to build our giant god damn usless-but-purty constructions and landscapes.  Lastly, the non-sandbox modes are brutal. Even if you have the materials to craft something, you can't craft it until you reach enough experience in the prerequisit tech tree research. I find myself crafting 14 'dyes' or 8 diving helmets or whatnot just to get enough experience in that tech to be able to craft further. It's infuriating at times. The crafting isn't all that streamlined either. Everytime you craft something new you must drag each ingredient from your inventory to its proper place. That would be forgivable IF you weren't required to craft nearly 100% of what's possible to craft to get to the end of the tech tree. One or the other. Absolutely not both.   Like I said, this game has so much potential, and as it is, it was still fairly fun for me for at least the first time through. However, now when I play I just end up frustrated every time. It's like the designers are too concerned with 'what makes sense?' and not enough with 'what is fun?'. Streamline menus, find a new crafting/tech system, speed the game up, realtime 'increase priority of task', and don't have the mob attack timer on constantly. Maybe a mob attacks only when you steal a rune or something underground so you can choose the time.  It's mostly a solid game, and I'm sure some people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

            "review_text": "While the concept of this game is cool, the execution is terrible. For a fortress management game, Craft the World is severely lacking in tools that enable the player to manage their little dwarf colony.  Basically the way dwarves are managed is that you assign tasks by clicking on objects/tiles to harvest or creatures to kill, assigning things to be crafted, and for objects to be placed. Along with these tasks, there is also the generic task of picking up objects that are dropped when resources are harvested. The dwarves themselves decided which of the above tasks they will do, and in what order. From what I've seen, unless one of their skills correlates to one of the jobs (more on that later), they will simply do whatever task is quickest to complete. The only exception to this is when selecting an enemy to attack. In this pretty much all dwarves will drop what they are doing to attack the enemy.  There is no way for the player to prioritize tasks or to restrict dwarves to only do certain tasks. This means that trying to multitask is pretty much impossible as dwarves focus on tasks closest to the stockpile because they are the quickest to complete, ignoring tasks further away even if the further ones are more important. As a result things take forever to complete. This is made even worse when you take the pathfinding into account, expecially when it comes to gathering resources. When a dwarf is gathering resources it tries to fill its inventory before dropping things off at the stockpile. This means that if its inventory space is 3, and it is holding 2 objects while next to the stockpile and there is group resource across the map, the dwarf will walk all the way over to the distant pile, pick up one object, then walk all the way back to the stockpile to drop the objects off when clearly it'd be more efficient to drop off what it has, then go pickup 3 objects from the distant pile.  The only real management tools the player has is a portal and the mostly worthless skills mechanic. The portal spell opens a temporary shortcut between a tile on the map and a the stockpile. These portals are taken into account when calculating the speed at which a task can be completed, artficially giving distant tasks a higher 'priority' in the dwarves todo list. However, in order to keep the piority of distant tasks high the player must constantly open up new portals near distant tasks as the tasks closest to the old portal gets completed, as the further a task is from a portal, the lower its priority is.  Along with the portals, each can also have up to 3 skills that can influence which types of jobs it takes. For example, a dwarf with the mining skill will try to mine blocks before it tries to cut down trees, even if the trees are a quicker task to complete. Unfortunately this mechanic is almost completely worthless as each dwarf only starts with one skill, and what that skill they start with is competely worthless. This means that you'll most likely start with a bunch of dwarves that are skilled in worthless stuff like swimming and milling, when you really need things like mining, logging, carpentry and smithing at the start of the game. Furthermore, the only way to get new skills for a dwarf is by applying skill books to a dwarf. These books are rare drops that you get sometimes after harvesting a resource. Unfortunately what skills these books teach are also completely random, meaning that you might go an hour before a book drops with a skill that you need.  Overall the gameplay is excrutatingly slow and tedious. As far as I can tell the 'Campaign' of the game is just a sequence of randomly generating maps where in each one you have to build a portal in order to reach the next map. The portal pieces are hidden in secret rooms underground that you have to find. As levels progress the maps slowly get bigger and the difficulty gets higher. There are no special scenarios or win conditions for any of the maps as far as I can tell, making the Campaign feel extremely boring and repetitive after the first level.  In short, do not buy this game.",

While not game-breaking, the flaws make you realize you are playing an unfinished shell of a game that is simply wasting your time attempting to compensate for those flaws.   Pros ++ Polished Artwork and original style + Little to no bugs or game-breaking errors  Cons -- Bad AI for Dwarves and Monsters -- Very Small Worlds  -- No Campaign or Plot - Very limited bestiary - Constant and predictable monster waves - Boring/slow crafting system - No autofill for recipes - Lots of pointless click and drag - Limited in-game resources prohibit creativity  Ex. The player controlled spells like the Portal Spell are merely tricks that lets you bypass the slow gameplay and clunky AI of your minions.",

In adition to that, I can seem to get my Dwarfs so sleep or eat no mather what I do, and the game give so hint to what to do, many people in the forums seems to have the same issue.

You start out the game with nothing and you dont even have the recipes to build a house. But guess what you need a house in order to heal your people and keep them safe. By the time i was level 9 i still did not have the recipes to construct a house(had doors,locks, dec but no walls). Its like playing a RNG or a lottery trying to find the recipes you need. I had recipes for things that required other recipes that i did not have or the workbench to make either of them. In the end all my dwarfs were just about killed because i couldnt buy materials for a house or find the recipes to make one because they were so beaten from monsters to the point that, all they do is run away constantly, ingoring all your commands.Fk this game, save your money for a 2 year old coder trying to print a line statement for your entertainment.",

            "review_text": "'YOUR BRAIN IS BROKEN!'  This is last help tip review I'm writing. As a gamer for over 25 years or more , I've seen one bad game after another, with so many poor issue's one after another. This would be alright if it was a patch issue or a small fix but most are just poor designers game flaws that are part of the game and only could be fix with a complete over haul.  This game is no exception it has such good features yet playing the game is flawed with poor ideas that make it no fun. I'm not going to throw perils to the swine any more, just keep doing what you're doing and figure it out your self's . Here it is playing one world and leveling all the way up and beating the first world just to repeat the same leveling up from the start in the next world and having to play it at a harder level is a joke. Talk about a waste of time and game play and talking about another thing most of the items are useless to even have to make and objects just to be repeated. Like the title, DID YOUR MOMMA DROP YOU ON YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU WAS A BABY, because your brain must be broken, that's all I've got to say...  This game definitely needs an over haul...    Why are you a lieing a@#@# and say this game is like mine craft and Terraria and what ever, its nothing like it , I'm sick of game designers and false advertisements. The characters you can not contorl them this is dksjfgiojfds. Another good idea that took away from cool features and add some cool things but lost the control and freedom fun movement and play as did mine craft... I'm only keeping this game because my sons what to try it or it would be another flush it game. The cool run and build it no longer an ability in this game, its slow action workers is so boring it makes me what to throw up in a piece of tin foil and eat it would be better then this f#^&amp;%$ up game. Another game with more time waisted figuring out how to and why for and what ever... Just stop making games that work like sh@$ all ready. Hint! Try designing a game with new items and armor to build and stronger creatures, that should of been a no brainer.... Why dont you give me a job i'm a writer a expeirence gamer also an artist....7thSojurn Just now  I would have to say after 25 to 30 years of gaming not much has changed in impoving customers service in fact it may of gotton worse....  All gaming sites should have a person like me to test them and give the right review needed to stop robbing the customer of his heard earned money, like thats going to happen, ha ha ha aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.............I'm tired of buying games with a site that clearly seen how short of time its been played my kids all 5 of them tryed it thats why it seems like its been played a lot in fact all of them feel this game is a poor designed game that was nothing like the videos tryed to say another ripp off tactic that ♥♥♥♥ gets old... ask for refund never seen it. I wish they would hire me to review there games before putting them out that would be a good idea... no they will fine a kiss ♥♥♥ to do that...",

Sometimes dwarves can do things, sometimes they can't for no reason. -The game is really never updated with much content into free play mode. -You have to invidually put item by item, even if it's the same, into a crafting menu to craft things. -Some craftables take time, some don't, it's really random in what takes time and what doesn't. A salad takes time to make 3 while you can make plenty of DOORS and LOCKS in an instant. -Monsters do loads of damage. (ones in waves anyway), and can overpower you easily as they come in groups and never seperate. -Dwarves will fall when climbing for no reason. No explanation.

The tech tree resets and you lose all the equipment you've spent 4/5+ hours crafting and creating. That destroyed it for me as the only thing keeping you playing is a few minor changes from the world and the aestheics.  If the tech tree progressed as you went through the game then fair enough but its basically just a reset everytime you change world for £5 you'd get a decent review but for nearly £15 it's not worth it unless you like replaying levels with snow instead of forest etc.",
