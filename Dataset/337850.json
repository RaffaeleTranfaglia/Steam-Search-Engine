            "review_text": "I'm a long time Spiderweb fan and, as such, I'll just start by getting the obvious out of the way: this is a massive game with tons to do that improves on 'Escape from the Pit' in many aspects, not the least of which is storyline (which is much more sprawling and epic than EFTP's was). I enjoyed it immensely and if you at all like Spiderweb games or turn based RPGs in the tradition of Ultima, then you should buy this now.   That said, it is slightly disappointing at times just how little is improved upon from EFTP to A2:CS and how, in other aspects, the game takes a few step backwards. A2:CS fixes none of the glaring interface issues from EFTP. While the terrible pathfinding can perhaps be given a pass (as it would most likely require significant rewriting of the engine), other minor problems are less excusable: the right mouse button still cannot be mapped to actions (no scroll wheel either), the buttons that open the inventory still do not also close them, and despite the MASSIVE amount of screen space provided, you can still only map 4 spells/Battle Disciplines to the interface hotkeys.  Combat also remains a slog at times, with tons of trash mob fights that can get incredibly tedious, especially toward the end of the game when leveling slows down and experience starts to mean less. Many dungeons have large groups of enemies in every room, which often kills the fun of exploration and means lots of back tracking to towns to heal (especially since energy elixirs are a bit rarer than they were in EFTP).  In terms of steps backward, its boss battles are, by and large, pretty forgettable. Most Avernums, and EFTP was no exception, tend to throw in a few gimmicky or puzzle like boss battles to keep things interesting and make you change strategies from fight to fight. But A2:CS pretty much sticks to the tried and true, 'Dude with tons of hitpoints attacks hard and summons waves of minions as you reduce his health.' It does introduce more area of effect mechanics (such as bosses who cover the floor in fire or ice damage), but it uses them sparingly, and apart from one notable exception, most bosses are susceptible to most types of damage.  That said, I don't mean to give a bad impression of the game from harping on all its negative points without listing its positives (which are myriad). So I’ll end with a random list of the game’s delights:  -Maxing out Pole Arms and Hardiness on Mages and Priests to create invincible damage dealing tanks with adrenaline rush (i.e. the ability to attack 3 times in one turn). You aren’t really playing until your Priest can take 5 polearms to the face and live to cast level 3 “Divine Retribution” 4 times in one turn.  -Doomguard fights  -Random 90s sitcom references (“Absolutely Fabulous,” anyone?)  -Doomguard fights on speed (and also on speed in the game)  -Buying 2 levels of gymnastics for everyone endgame just to scratch an OCD itch in your brain  -Leaving a bottle of Almarian wine in an empty room in a Dharmon Inn for your hommies who have gone before",

            "review_text": "Avernum 2: Crystal Souls is a modern remake of their earlier game, Exile 2: Chystal Souls.  While I have found it to be an enjoyable game, it is worth noting that in spite of the graphical improvements, there are a few things that were cut back.  1. You now control a smaller party of four adventuriors, where in the past you could field as many as six. That's right, you used to be able to change your party size. You could even take the crazy route and try to solo the game. Not anymore.  2. Food. In the past you needed food in order to survive, needing to either stock up or forage as you go in order to not die of starvation. Now, food is just a weak healing item.  3. Spells have been completely revamped. One noticable absence being persistant area effect attacks. You could, for example, lay a field of ice shards that damages any who enter or remain in the field, creating an artificial barrier as it were. Most of the spell effects seem to be copy pasta from their other games... Fire bolts, buffs and the like.  It isn't a bad game. Far from it. It is just somewhat sad to see it scaled down to fit in a more modern game engine.",

I played the original (Avernum 2, not Exile 2, its predecessor), and like the remake a lot. So much I played it 2x; 1x w/ the default party (a solid choice), and a 2nd time w/ a custom party.  Lots of good advice over at the Spidweb boards for newcomers to the game. I also took copious notes, as there's a lot to keep track of.  Now I'm going to try a custom party w/ Avernum: Escape From The Pit, which I played a few years back (default party). Good times.",

Something I like about this game is the existance of the heros you played in the last game being throughout this game. You get to speak to and see all kinds of people you dealt with in the first game. This is truly a continuance of Escape From The Pit. Can't beat it.",

Compare to its original version, Exile 2, the original Avernum 2 is more streamlined version in a better way. But this version of Avernum (Avernum 2: Crystal Souls) is dumbed down: the skill system is skill tree without any good reason, lack of skills, the food management aspect is very stupid (you use food to resurrect characters in resting areas like campfires), poor weapon variation (no one handed spear, no rock throwing, no arrows, no clubs, no two-handed swords, lack of darts), less spells, you cannot bash doors and no recruitable NPCs. Also, death has no consequences because your dead party members will always revive when you enter a friendly town for free unlike in the original Avernum 2 and Exile 2 where you had to pay a priest to revive them for a huge sum of money. Just play the original Avernum 2 - you can still get it on GOG in a package called Avernum: The Complete Saga.",
