Simple pleasant background 3d environment with Pamela Possum strolling (without any imput from the player) from point to point and (somewhat educational) real paintings to assemble from national arts museum. I can't say anything more, but I can't say anything bad about it as well.  Got the key from a giveaway site, probably from the recent bundle, so if you want a jigsaw game for you and your kid, especially if it's in a bundle, I recommend it.",
