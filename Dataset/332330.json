            "review_text": "Probably the nicest surprise of this year's sales. I got PixelJunk Shooter first, and liked it so much I had to get this edition too.  The Ultimate edition was well worth getting as well. Much improved graphics (to they extent that I can only play the new version on my PC; too much work for the GTX870M in my laptop) extra-decent sound track, and the same great gameplay as the original with more levels.  The excellent physics for fluids/gasses are used effectively and interestingly.  This game is 30% twin-stick shooter, 30% puzzle, 30% exploration/collecting, 30% speed runner and 20% indication that maths graduates really  can't  add up.",
