            "review_text": "Meh. It is OK for a HOG, but it is a bit clunky in terms of puzzle mechanics, and the acting is TERRible. I never use hints in HO scenes or puzzles (I do play a lot of HOGs), but with this one, I had to just to figure out what I needed to do. It is trying for different kinds of puzzles, and I do appreciate that, but mostly this is a miss. If you are itching for a HOG and this is the only option, then hey, if it's on sale, go for it. Otherwise, I would move on. FYI, if the game is not properly full-screening for you, you should still be able to select options and then switch off the full screen mode. Your screen will flicker a bit, but for me, it all came back in just fine.",
