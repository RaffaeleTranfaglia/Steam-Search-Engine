            "review_text": "Ballad of Solar is a very simple game with very simple mechanics, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to play. Ballad of Solar is an epic of a pampered prince who is trying to save his girl from the evil's of a wizard. The gameplay consists of 2 or 3 maps per level. Each map is a static board that has roads leading to objectives. Each objective is blocked by trees and rocks and holes. You need to manage resources to preform the task of clearing each object. More simply put, you click stuff on the map to clear it, then you move on to the next map. It's nearly imposible to lose a level, the storyline is all but annoying, and the voice acting is horrendous. However, the game has just enough fun to keep you ocupied. I am an achievement hound; I don't normally play games unless there's some achievements to unlock. I played this game to the end despite that fact. I picked this title up for $2 and at that price it's well worth it. I definately recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for a casual playthrough that requires little to no effort.",

You don't die and there isn't much machanics to the fights. More of a collect stuff and conquer to play through the levels. There is a time limit and the only way for losing in this game is not finishing everything before the time runs out.  I would give this game about a 5 out of 10. If you have children that play on the computer this game would be good for them... :)",

The design is gorgeous and atractive and the story is cute but very common. I took around 5 hours to finish the game. It's worth.",
