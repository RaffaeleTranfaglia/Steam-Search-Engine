None of that is a real negative, but it might take some people a bit by surprise. In terms of general atmosphere, it feels like the sort of game that's typically longer than that, which might take some players by surprise.  For a short game, there are a lot of good things to say! The atmosphere is unique and compelling. The story is interesting. As exploration games go, this one is unusually well-crafted: exploration is outright the entire game.  I haven't personally tried this game on a VR set et, but I suspect it would only improve the experience. Go for it!",
