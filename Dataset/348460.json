All of your macthes are going to be nothing but the free class (Raider). This means after one match it gets silly and repetitive.   Horrible choice for the business model.",

The game has ping issues at the time of this review's creation, so matchmaking can be troublesome. It is an easy 100% game, though. However, some of them are grindy.  The graphics and animation of this game remind me of Ubisoft's 'Mighty Quest for Epic Loot', not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but Huntress has a great ♥♥♥. So they have that going for them.   PROS:  Achievements Decent concept (I hear some compare this to rugby or football, which I know nothing about) Trailer animation looks good  CONS:  Pay for the other 4 classes Limited gameplay Kinda' boring  If you want something truly fun, you might want to look elsewhere. I can't see myself coming back to this game for any reason other than if new achievements were given to it.  3/10",

I didn't find the game interesting of funny, the sound was awful (99% of it was screaming lady with 'a-a-a-a') and all looked very outdated. Main screen is unfriendly.  Maybe someone pays for new chars but I didn't find it usefull to spend even the traffic to download the game.",

SO you gave a team with the only two classes avalible. and if the other team has oh i don't know ANY other class your team is basicly f#ckt. this would be a great game if not for the class payment that makes it a total pay 2 win.  if they gonna change it i would gladly play it but if not.... you can buy the medic and rek any 'free to play team'   3/10 -could be good but they f#ckt it up",

This is back word logic. The game over all is some what fun even though its bugg to all ♥♥♥♥. The style just makes me want to play Happy wars some more... I'm going to go do that instead.   Not worth the down load time due to the pay to win. Think tf2 is it only gave you the demo man and scout with free hats but no way to unlock the other classes unless you paid $5.99 for them. Its still a good game because free hats? -not really.-",

If you haven’t figured out by now, the whole thing is a really silly take on the Vikings with probably all possible stereotypes. The whole craziness was why I installed it in the first place but soon realised that things aren't as great as they may look after watching the trailer: The game unfortunately is standing with one foot in the grave.

The ROcket League have one too and look at it. If you want to play free Rocket League with wikings epic graphic and funny gameplay play this game. Yea you have only two characters but you can level them up and they will give you epic equipment.  Its really funn just try it. Because beer and sheeps and wikings in one game ? sounds crazy but its way better than you think. Hope the studio will continue in development and start fixing bugs and optimisation.",

First thing you will notice is that classes are locked behind a paywall what makes the base already in it's core pay2win.  Secondly, the graphic even on 'Epic' is lower mid of mobile gaming port. The textures are muddy and realy look like a very upscaled mobile tables game.",
