Source engine has done it again releasing a title that has given me hours of pleasure to play. Everything from the shooting aspect, to reloading, to the gaining of skills (and luck) makes this game extremely rewarding when you walk away from the gunfights alive. In short, a Source engine made western shooter with realistic reload times, shooting aspects, and whiskey (very important) makes for a challenging yet awesome experience that keeps me coming back for more.  A true must have with no excuse, whatsoever, for one to not at least try it out.",

The game is small and uses source engine so it should run easy on most modern pc's. The chaos that is a team shootout can be a lot of fun, or if you prefer to solo it in a free for all you can have that as well. Team play involves picking one of 4 choosable teams, the rangers, banditos, vigilantes, and desperados. Once the match starts bodys start flying. Overall the game has a good amount of weapon choices but few maps and mechanics however simplicity is not a bad thing, especially for a free game. I recommend you try Fistful of Frags yourself, you might have as much fun as I did!",

Here's what this game is, pardner: A mod of the Source Engine that plays out as a medium-paced, close-range arena shooter. You create a loadout of Wild West-style weaponry and go into battle with a pack of curly wolves not unlike your-rough-cut-self. The primary combat mode is free-for-all: Indeed, the close-range combat and synchopated flow of action work well with its 'battle royale' style.  Pony up.  The game's overall feel is not unlike Quake, with lots of hitscan twitch-aiming and weapon-swapping. By the time you've made a frag or two, you've gone through your whole loadout twice--and that's great. Every choice matters and there is no single option that beats the bunch. The game encourages smart ambushes, with split-second decision-making to augment the coordination needed to score kills. It's a game of big set-ups, big pay-offs, and big losses. The winnin'-est cowboy knows when to play to the gallery, and when to skedaddle, to avoid lookin' the blowhard.  Don't put a spoke in the wheel like a thoroughbred just yet, though. Not everything is in apple pie order, nor is it as fine as cream gravy, buttered grits, or roast Arbuckle's. Bend an elbow, and read the goods 'ccordin' to Hoyle:  The gameplay featured in Fistful of Frags can be as repetetive as it is fun. It's simple, enjoyable, exciting, and--paradoxically--mesmerizingly dull after you've played each map for an hour or two. A few friends can help liven the game up, for sure. Being as stool-trippin'-ly roosted as the posse in-game can do wonders too. You high-falutin' nancy.  Shut yer damn bazoo.  Don't take this flannel mouth's gab for nothin', though, lessin' you try the game yerself. When you're feelin' like a bona fide coffee boiler, saddle up to a server on Fistful of Frags and send some sorry shave-tails to the ol' bone orchard. Shoot or give up the gun already, Lukey-boy ye damn varmit! Also, fasten on your best bib and tucker, before you have a hog-killin'-esque alright time of it. Y'here.  7.1 / passthewhisky.",

            "review_text": "In short:  Pros - Quality maps, good learning curve, kicking mechanic, notoriety system, balanced combat (including an emphasis on melee), incredibly funny (you drink whiskey to regain health, among other things), plenty of servers, nice community (so far), all content completely free, continued contributions and dedication by developers.  Cons - Occasional bugs. Timing is somewhat important when trying to find a well populated server.  In detail:  FoF is a multiplayer-only wild-west themed first person shooter. Combat ranges from fast-paced but vulnerable deadly melee and bow loadouts to the slower black powder guns that pack a punch. When spawning in DM, players can chose one main weapon, two side weapons, and the choice of selecting a dominant hand or going ambidextrous.   The loadout you select sets the pace on how a player should move through the map. For example, selecting the ax as the main weapon allows the player to move through the map more quickly than any other weapon, but leaves you more vulnerable in open spaces. These players tend to quickly move through tighter spaces and catch enemies off guard. Some weapons, such as the Sheffield, are most effective at medium range and can be dual wielded. Combat is intense both at medium and short ranges until a lengthy reload is needed. Others, such as the Carbine, are the best bet for those with a steady hand, keen eye, and low ping.  The deadliness of the weapon, or course, depends on how effectively the play moves through the map. Players with the ax will 9/10 times be obliterated when running straight at a gun-wielding foe. Players often chose to remain in combat with awful odds of success rather than running around a corner to ambush later or to the nearest bottle of whiskey. Often times, switching to melee and running while health is low can be a legitimately good strategy, as the opposing player will usually chase with a weapon out, making them noticeably slower and allowing the player to run to safety and health.  Reloading can be frustrating for those not used to it. In many games, reloading can be a trivial factor, as it takes nearly no time. In FoF, many of the guns don't hold many rounds, making reloading at the right time crucial. There will often be times when switching out the gun for a melee weapon to take care of a close enemy is the better option. Most weapons are loaded one round at a time, allowing for a quick shot if the player doesn't have the time to reload all rounds at once.   One mechanic all players have is the ability to kick. Base damage for a kick is 20/100, and sends the kicked player backwards if successful, but leaves the kicker standing still for a short amount of time. Kicking can lead to other damage types, such as kicking players off a ledge or into a prop for extra damage. Also, in sending the kicked player straight backwards, it can allow the kicker to line up a clean shot. Often times, kicks are followed by easy shots.  Side arms are incredibly important. Knives can be thrown and used for melee. Brass knuckles do slightly more damage than base fists, but can disarm a player with a lucky hit. Dynamite can be cooked before being thrown. The gentleman and gun throw option are incredibly more difficult to use effectively, but have drastically higher point payouts if utilized correctly.   Regaining health is the funniest aspect of this game. Players must drink bottles of whiskey (25 per bottle) to regain health. This throws the player's aim off, accuracy still depends on a player's movement. If a player is not moving and shoots the gun while incredibly drunk, the bullet will still have the same chance of hitting where the crosshair was; the crosshair just changes position until the effects wear off. Players also regain health with no ill effects by opening a gold chest.  Overall, FoF has a more than fair amount of content for a free game. Those who aren't familiar with FPS-ers can still jump on and have a good time with starting weapons, while more experienced players will have fun learning in depth how to use some of the weapons geared towards a specific combat type. Players often win matches using bows, axes, deringers, and other weapons that need some practice to use effectively. There are also more than enough taunts, so players can say what they want!  So, give FoF a try! It's free, fun, and funny! There's nothing to lose! Andėle! And pass the whiskey!",

            "review_text": "Fistful of frags;  Fistful is a wonderful first person shooter game utilizing an old version of the source engine and a western based theme. The game consists of a few different maps, lots of different weapons, and four main teams; Banditos, rangers, vigilantes and desperados. The weapons are also correct of that period, the 1861 navy revolver for example; its a real gun! As are all the guns in fistful.(watch all the clint eastwood westerns youre sure to spot a few)  Tactics;  Now this is where it gets fun. So youre in this game, in your cowboy outfit shooting your guns, but theres a lot of ways to do that. You can 'run and gun', grab a revolver and shoot at people! Or, you can grab a ranged weapon, and get some distance between you and your targets. However, due to recent game changes, the rifles are exceedingly more difficult to use than the single handed weapons; more on that later.  The in game scoring system is reffered to as 'notoriety', again fitting the cowboy/western theme. The guns all posess a base notoriety, that increases incrementally with enlarging killstreak. More powerful weapons have lower base notoriety, so the sharps rifle has a base score of 4 points per kill, while the volcanic pistol has a base score of 10 notoriety points. This means that the easiness of killing a person with a powerful gun is offset by a low scoring bonus and vice versa.  Due to the placement of explosive barrels around the map (lol), it is wise to shoot them when enemies are near, this brings a large point bonus. There are also parts of the maps that you can shoot through with more powerful weapons. Arguably the most powerful weapon in the game is the sharps rifle, which has a large magnifying scope that allows the user to see cross-map and accurately pick off targets. The trade off to all this power, is that there is a large smoke cloud infront of the user after shooting, and ofcourse also the loud crack of a rifle blast; both affecting the visability of the user.  Pistols and rifles;  Recently again, there has been a lot of change in fistful. The ranged weapons are the victims of recurring 'nerfs', such as the smith rifle, losing its accuracy and gaining a damage penalty. The schofield revolver however, seems to have as much or more range than the smith rifle. After all the rifle is for sniping, the pistol for medium to short range combat; Is it correct to have it this way?  Im sure that these nerfs are there for a reason, and im not here to question that. Im here to review the game, so now ill start talking a little more that way.  My personal opinion;  I love this game. Its fun to play for many different people, with many different play styles. Such a simple idea, and simple mechanic come together to make a game as fun as anything else ive played recently. It can make you laugh, and it can make you rage (due to the lack of cheat protection). But thats another reason to love this game, its soo course that you can use it how you want to.  If you want a good fps with a cowboy theme then this is for you. It will push all your buttons and tickle all your funny spots. However, if youre going to try to dominate, then it wont be so much fun. Ive been there.  To sum up, i enjoy playing this game a lot, and recommend it to anyone who wants to try it/ loves fps games.  Thanks for reading my review, have a nice day.  ~CB.",

First, the hit detection system really sucks ♥♥♥. Most of the time 3/10 headshots and 1/10 body shots don't register at all. Also axe, knife and machete can hit from 10 meters away or not at all. I have read that this is the case for all games with Source engine. I have a good internet connection and ping around 50ms so I don't think it is to blame.   Second, there could be more weapon damage. Why does it take at least 3 body shots or 2 headshots for most weapons to kill someone? Every gameplay balancing update seems to lower the weapon damage even more.  These two flaws ruin the otherwise awesome game at least for me. I hope the damage system will be changed and the hit detection system improved.   I recommend this game for everyone who can live with these problems.

There also includes many new models and characters, not related to Half-Life 2 at all (it seems that HL2 mods are disliked usually for the fact that they use many of the same models as the original game).  Everything gameplay related is great. But sadly the only bad part of Fistful of Frags is it's unfriendly community. I can safely say that this community is nearly equal to the typical CoD community. Swearing, unforgiving, annoying, and tryharding are some traits that you will often meet on every server. No 'gg's', no compliments, I could even say 'every man for himself' in this situation. Maybe this type of community will flush out eventually, but unfortunatly at the moment all we have are imbeciles running around in the old west.

The game has this intensity very few games have due to your weapons that fire slow and reload slow compared to the 'modern warfare' boner trend that's been going on.

The vast amount of maps is another amazing part about this game. If you get bored after playing a bit, just search for another map/server. I could go on for hours saying good things about this game. But now I'll point out a few things that I find personally annoying. First of all, the games controls are kinda floaty, making it hard to do parkour and to get head shots let alone any shot. The accuracy system is a good idea but hard to deal with when moving around and you are stuck with 1%. There's a couple more minor things to point out but, after all. It is a free game.

But it also happens the other way around, so it washes out in the end. The 'Break-Bad' mode is the most fun for me. Great players and most are nice. In that mode, you can disarm yourself - which can be strategic because if someone shoots you, they are 'jailed' for one minute. Watch out for those who are disarmed! (Their hands are down at their sides.) Drinking whiskey is your health - this is wicked funny. If you drink too many whiskeys too fast, your screen gets greenish and wobbly because you are 'drunk' for 30 seconds. Hilarious because you can still shoot people. You can actually earn one of the achievements for enough drunk frags. The characters say funny things - which makes me lol too.",

I have grown to love this delightfully crafted game (That fels like a cross between an indie FPS, CSS, and Red Dead Redemption. It is a very light game, with no storyline. Despite this, it offers hours of fun, and stupidity. Since the firearms in this game are not very precise, slow firing, and slow reloading; many battles end up being intense Meele fights between many players. Overall I think this is a Charming, Fun, And downright LOL game. I personally plan on playing this game ALOT more on this account. (I have like 20~ hours on my non-main account)",

He's just jealous of my devotion for Fistful of Frags. I called him a ♥♥♥♥. He slaps me and sends me to sleep. I'm crying now, and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Fistful of Frags. I am so happy. He whispers in my ear 'This is my game' He grabs me with his powerful western hands and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my ********* for Fistful of Frags. He penetrates my ******** It hurts so much, but I do it for Fistful of Frags. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Fistful of Frags. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Fistful of Frags looks him straight in the eyes and says, 'its all frags now' Fistful of Frags leaves through my window. Fistful of Frags is love, Fistful of Frags is life     On a Serious note, This game is amazing.",

I sometimes forget how really fun this game can get when I stop playing it for a while. It feels way less of a mod, and more of a stand alone game which is great. Its free so you have no excuse not to alteast try it and see if it is way more fun than cs.",

This game is just so well made, fun, and can entertain you for a long time.  All of this for free!  There is a decent amount of weapons, perks and weapons 'skills' and maps.  Currently there are 2 game modes: Team Deathmatch and Deatchmatch.  However, you can play TDM in up to 4 teams! Not just two!  You can choose your equipment based on how you would like to play, and if you get tired of those weapons, take a look in these boxes around the maps!  There are three boxes: Blue (Includes basic wepaons, that can be used in dual wield, and a hatchet) Red: Includes better weapons, like Winchester lever rifle, and Golden: Includes weapons like powerfull shotgun!  But be carefull, once you die, you will loose it, and your opponent might steal it!  The devs are planning to add more content, like maps, game modes, and possibly weapons.  If you are looking for a great FPS shooter, with a Western theme, you should play this one! Its just awesome!

First of all I would like to mention that you cannot critisize a free game without any exclusive content. Of course it might not be perfect, but you can easily see how much work has been going into it. The little details, like the horses that kill you if you shoot them in the back, the soundtracks and the brilliant animations are great example for this. As the graphics certainly are not the game's big strength, the gameplay is for sure. Playing FoF requires the player to keep calm, land every shot perfectly and to decide whether to stand still, to fan or to try getting that whiskey next to the watermelon in the safe. On the opposite site there is much more that can be improved, too. For example: more gamemodes could be added and more maps could be designed. But at the end of the day I can still say that this game is defenitely worth downloading, playing and supporting and I am glad to be able to play Counterstrike 19th century style.",

Once you're past that, you'll spend a period of time getting used to shotgun snipers, drooling hatchet scum, and a variety of hellspawn alike.  One of the few tips I'd say comes in handy are;  -aim for the head -don't bother shooting in melee range -don't reload until you've checked the area (the game doesn't easily let you stop halfway) -pick up loaded weapons instead of reloading your own  Other than that, I'd just recommend not spending too much time on it. There is a supposed competitve scene, but from what I know it's really not big enough to be worth mentioning, and being the one overplayed N/L on a pub should hardly be your goal. Dunno, I'd say play counter strike or tf2 if you're actually looking to get serious in this type of thing.",

            "review_text": " Fistful of Frags  is the full release re-imagining of the popular Western FPS mod for  Half Life 2  originally developed in 2007. The game features skill based gunplay inspired by popular spaghetti western films like the 1964 film “Fistful of Dollars” which inspired the name. Players assume the identities of outlaws, lawmen and banditos and may fight in team based or free-for-all game modes.  As far as your shooting options go, there are plenty. Dual derringers, smith carbines, colt navy revolvers, volcanic repeaters, sawed-off shotguns, and even a bow and arrow.  Fistful of Frags  is also the rare game where you can hold your gun in whichever hand you like (why don't more games do this, anyway?). Just click the mouse wheel and you'll swap your gun between hands. Some servers even let you specify which hand you're a better shot with.  But forget about shooting for a minute. Instead of using a Mare's Leg to kill your opponents, use your own leg. Have you ever wanted to kick a cowboy to death? You can do that, and you'll, and sometimes massive kick-fights will break out on a map which is one of the funnier events to witness and participate in. Double-handed fisticuffs are on the menu, too, with bare fists or knuckle dusters, which let you punch someone so hard they'll drop their gun. Did they even have brass knuckles in the old west? Again, it doesn't matter, as long as cowboys die comically.  Unlike other shooters which require running and gunning, this one dictates that you stand still and aim properly so that your rewarded with greater accuracy. It also authenticates the guns of the old, by making them weak, slow and rather heavy slowing down your speed.    Fistful of Frags Key Features:    Down that Whiskey  – the game is very lighthearted, much like Team Fortress, with elements like drinking whiskey as health potions.  Friggin' Hard to Aim  – players must stand still to accurately hit their targets. This makes for entertaining gameplay, as it is both frustrating and amusing.  Fun Team PvP Modes  – from the common team deathmatch to unique modes like Break Bad (where it can be free-for-all), there are plenty of game modes.  Quick Matches  – hop from one game to the next, solo or with friends, and enjoy quick matches filled with a ton of action.  Variety of Weapons  – from brass knuckles to classic revolvers to bows, FoF has a ton of weapons for players to pick up and master.  A unique FPS with a truly original idea. This is the only Western Deathmatch shooter out there, so give it a try. The original mod and the Steam version are both free to play.  The main developer has hinted that there are new player models and animations soon to be introduced in the not so distant future. There has also been a large amount of chatter in regards to steam workshop compatibility, Steam inventory drop items and a co-operative mode against a constant wave of enemies. It's the developers dedication to his product and his listening ear to his fans that makes this completely free to play game worthy of a slot in your library.  A pleasant surprise. If you like westerns and you want to try something simple and fast,  Fistful of Frags  is surprisingly good. It's fast, it's hectic, it's funny, and even elderly PCs can easily handle running it. And frankly, it's just a joy to turn off your brain for a while and start blasting away.",

The shooting works as it should: You point a gun at people and people die; the guns feel somewhat genuinely true to the time period, but not enough so to make using them unfun; the game gets constant updates, and there's still a decent amount of people playing still.   It also heartens me that it's a no-catch , full F2P that the developers seem to still be putting their heart and soul into, constantly improving and fine-tuning the game to make it a better experience for everyone.

Running on the Source Engine it is a game whose matches often swivel into anarchy at its fullest form. It was originally a mod for HL2 in 2006 but has been remade as an absolutely AWESOME f2p game. The ideas are simple: pick your loadout of a primary weapon, a secondary item/weapon and your choice of handgun skill (this is how the weapon functions and changes accuracy and other attributes).  Graphics-wise, it's the same as HL2 but the scenery, at times, is a beauty and it's highly possible somebody will make new shaders for it some time else. It's frantic, it's hilarious, it's fun and at the same time it can be strategic. This game is a gem.",

I'm honestly not that big of a first person shooter guy, but this is my go to. The main thing that attracted me to this game was the weaponly. There are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 750 rpm (rounds per minute) 30 clip sized bearly any recoil 3 shot killing assult rifles/smgs. All weapons require some kind of skill to use, even the more 'unskilled' kind, like the shotguns. Not only that, but because the average dps of the guns are lower then a modern fps game, they give you more time to think. THINK! thinking in a first person shooter?!? I'm a big turn based rpg guy, with multiple final fantasies, indie rpgs, and Atlas titles (for my 3ds), so a first person shooter that accually favors thinking is a godsend. Granted, in reality, it's not much time at all to think, but it's there. The heavy use of enviroment, situation awareness, and favoring of taking time to aim properly (even the weakest of guns are 2 shot kills to the head at optimal ranges, and many are insta kills.) Also, the hp system is an acual hp bar at 100. So you can think in terms of percentage on how much you did. Also, there is no regen, if you get hit, you keep that damage, so taging someone for 80% and telling your teammate does do something.  Dam, I could talk about this alot more. But the fact that I love this game more then Shin Megami Tensei 4 (my second favorate of 2015), undertale, LISA, Darkest Dungeon, pokemon omega ruby, and many other turn based rpgs says alot about this game.",

            "review_text": "John Felix Anthony Cena Jr. (born April 23, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, rapper, actor and reality television show host signed to WWE. Cena has been credited by WWE as the public face of that organization, and has served as its franchise player since 2005. Cena is the host of American Grit on FOX.  Cena started his pro wrestling career in 1999 with Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), and won the UPW Heavyweight Championship the following year. Cena signed a developmental contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later renamed to WWE) in 2001, debuting on the WWE main roster in 2002. From a generic character in 2002, Cena morphed into an arrogant and edgy rapper for the time period of 2002-2003. Cena later transitioned to his current character, which he describes as a 'goody-two shoes Superman'. However, Cena has been labeled as the 'most polarizing pro wrestler ever' as his character has many supporters and many detractors.  So far, Cena has won 24 championships, with 15 reigns as a world champion (12 times as WWE Champion/WWE World Heavyweight Champion and three times as World Heavyweight Champion), five reigns as United States Champion and four reigns as world tag team champion (two World Tag Team and two WWE Tag Team). Furthermore, he is a 2012 Money in the Bank ladder match winner, a two-time Royal Rumble winner (2008, 2013), and a three-time Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner (2009, 2010, 2012). Cena has the fourth-highest number of combined days as WWE World Heavyweight Champion, behind Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, and Hulk Hogan. He has also headlined WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, on five different occasions (WrestleManias 22, 23, XXVII, XXVIII, and 29) over the course of his career.  Outside of wrestling, Cena has released the rap album You Can't See Me, which debuted at No. 15 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and starred in the feature films The Marine (2006), 12 Rounds (2009), Legendary (2010), The Reunion (2011), Trainwreck (2015), and Sisters (2015).[19] Cena has also made appearances on television shows including Manhunt, Deal or No Deal, MADtv, Saturday Night Live, Punk'd, Psych, and Parks and Recreation. He was also a contestant on Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race, where he made it to the final round before being eliminated, placing third in the overall competition.  Cena is involved in numerous philanthropic causes; most notably with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He has granted the most wishes in Make-A-Wish history.",

Add the butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut it all together until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the prepared pan and bake until golden around the edges, about 20 minutes.  3. For the filling: Stir together the sugar and flour. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.  4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours, then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.  (Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)",

I just have to give it a bad review for the anger it has caused me from these common issues that I struggle with alot, and there's no way that I'm alone.  1. You have to switch to another weapon to stop a reload 2. You cannot kick while reloading, you have to switch to another weapon 3. You walk insanely slower while reloading and after being shot, which makes a bad day for you if they happen together 4. There's no way to tell where you're team is unless you search, but with the tiny maps, you'll run into several enemies before that happens 5. Throwing knives is WAAAY to slow, especially for close-encounters 6. To shoot somewhat accurately, you have to stand COMPLETELY STILL 7. You can get blocked from escape by other players, which is a douchey thing to do when you have to reload, but they have a hatchet ready 8. When holding right-click with most weapons (activating a 'rapid fire mode'), accuracy drops/rises to about 50% before you even shoot 9. You move SUPER SLOWLY while crouching (I wish it was just a tiny bit faster) 10. Once you open the Team Change menu, it cannot be closed until you die or change teams 11. This one is a little silly, but an arrow appears on the screen in red when you get shot, but points the opposite way than the shooter. This just gets a little annoying when you are low on health and have to fight back.  All in all, the concept is great and I LOVE IT, yet these issues surely make more people than just me angry. If these problems were adjusted or fixed, I would definitely change this review!",

Sure you can say I am just a non-skilled/bad/sucky player at the game, but even I am new to the game and it isn't that fun to just keep dying and having to find weapons when you have none to begin with. The starting weapon is usualy the fist, and against someone with a gun or a knife. You will have to keep finding crates rated at High-Medium-Low meaning you could find crappy or good weapons and when you die, you would lose them. And trying to heal, you need to drink booze, or whiskey, or moonshine, The point is that when you need to heal you drink it, and when you drink it, you will get a little drunk and that can mess up the game.

I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.   Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.  Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:  10/10 BUY THIS GAME.",

That's another thing: Why are there four teams? I keep mixing up the Banditos and the Desparados up with each other, the Rangers can basically hide in shadows with little effort, and the guns seem a BIT unbalanced; long-ranged special guns almost guarantee a one-hit kill, but the shotgun at point-blank won't.

Movement seems strange from a start but after a while you get the hang of it. The weapons are 'wild west' - pistols, rifles, dynamites, knifes (which can be thrown), but also you have a bow and an axe (tomahawk I guess) which is really cool. At the start of the rounds you can grab some perks - you want to be ambidextrous or maybe be better with one specific hand, do you want to have a hard boots to be able to kick your enemies in the butt or crotch more stronger?  Unfortunately the games only mods now implemented are deathmatch and team deathmatch (which are called shootout), but there will be more ported to standalone version - Fistful of Dollars/Few Dollar, bank robbery, pistol duels , etc. Killing enemies gives you not only frags, but also notoriety level. The harder to kill with the weapon (that contains your fists and might boot) the more notoriety you gain.  The game is 100 % free. I really recommend it to everybody who likes wild west or maybe just something different from main shooters. I am also waiting with joy for more maps and more game play modes.

Honestly, if your a fan of Team Fortress 2 I feel you will really enjoy this game. It does have a few gameplay quirks that become increasingly irratating like the fact that when you don't hold a weapon and are disarmed you walk slower. Then when your timer runs out tons of people with guns are surrounding you waiting for it to forcefully arm you again. This sucks because when you play Break Bad (One of the gamemodes) you try to sell weapons you picked up from dead enemies to get points for your teams. Theirs 4 teams and everytime you spawn you are disarmed. When you are disarmed no one will try to hurt you, usually, as they will be jailed for hurting a disarmed. But, when you sell your guns, are jailed, or missed the buy period and must stay diasrmed, people can just wait for the timer to run down and then kill you with no chance of survival. And, because you are slower you can't escape the people as they follow you around the map. I just find it dumb because it would take very little time to fix this in the code. Just change the speed at which disarmed move. It would make the game much less rage inducing. But, overall the game quirks shouldn't stop anyone from trying the game. It generally is good and can keep me playing for a couple hours at a time.",

While you're in a heated battle with a guy who jumps around as if he's playing a very buggy version of Mario, you accidently press the taunt button. You're suddenly overwhelmed with joy, even though you were smashed in the crotch by a strange man with long hair and a trenchcoat, as you discover the way of shouting 'PASS THE WHISKEY!!!'. Finding this amazing, you decide to spam the 'PASS THE WHISKEY' button, until someone (who is either wearing a top hat, or a shady trenchcoat) decides to have a vote to kick you. Eventually, everyone agrees and you get kicked, you're virtual high is over, or is it? The answer is NO, you're virtual high has just begun...  You come back the next day more determined and more patient than ever before! You join a server and you're again transported to a strange map that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. You do the same thing over and over again, until you find another weird thing in the game, kicking. You check the controls, get your phone, search up '300 this is Sparta 1 hour edition' and put a weight on the voice chat button (k). The same thing happens with kicking as it did with 'PASSING THE WHISKEY' and you kicked off the server, you crawl up into a ball wondering why your not funny. big number/10 ING Hexagon and gamespit- Would be Leonidas again.",

I like FPS games to begin with. A free game? Why the heck not. It's fun to get drunk in this game. I find it clever and comical that you have to drink whiskey in order to obtain health, whilst achieving a blurry drunken state of being for a short period of time, which makes it difficult to shoot straight.  I would like to see gatling guns and cannons added to this game. The ability to kick while moving would be cool. More maps would be nice.  Overall the game is fun. I've already posted 100+ hours into this game and don't regret that at all. It's a fun game, especially since it's free. The only complaint I have is I wish there were more achievements to unlock, more maps, and more weapons. Hopefully in the future this game will have all of those!

What do you have to lose if it's free, it's not thirty dollars, not 5 dollars, hell not even 99 cents. Yet people have immediately dropped the game like it was the Black Plague because of ONE 'helpful' negative review just one. I don't see why they can't download the game and judge it themselves instead of looking on the outside. Gamers like SeaNanners, Star, Muselk, Jerma and Totalbiscuit have said that this game is great. Overall this game is great, it has weapons that feel good and mechanics that punish you for being maniac on drugs shooting people with no pants. From 14 hours I played no bugs have broken the game like a leg after a 20 ft drop. I hope the developer keeps on going, he just recently added a new weapon being the Yellowboy and I hope he can add more content to keep a beautiful western game going.

Easy to learn controlls (dunno what all the rage in the negitive comments is about), a shooting mechanic thats simple yet hard to master and most importantly no regenerating health. Thats a big thing for me in multiplayer games. I hate when I clip a guy for half of his health with a sniper fifle and he pops back out of cover without fear a few seconds later because his bullet wound magicly cured itself. The only way to get health back is with medkits in the form of moonshine. And even then they are spaced out pretty sparingly in most maps. Your lucky if you get more than two in a room. Some people have also complained about the movement speed. I woulden't mind if the characters moved a little faster but I never feel slow. The community for the most part is fairly supportive and tolerant of newcomers (ie more lambs to the derringer slaughter.) So yeah. Get this game. Its free, its fun, and its got the longest reload times out of any fps ive played.  EDIT: So some stuff happened. The main dev banned a guy for hacking when he wasnt and then got even more angry when that same dude posted a review telling everyone what had happened. Since this incident he has released a statement saying he will no longer be creating content for the game, simply doing bug fixes and adding community maps. He quit developing this game because of a single review. If he hadn't recieved so many requests from people who wanted to see this game stay alive he probobly would have just left forever. FOF is still an awsome western source game but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if its dev dosen't have skin made of rice paper.",

The game is multiplayer only unless you want to play against bots which i dont reccomend. The game is fun, and i feel it is a unique FPS you will not get to experience anywhere else. However, the game can be very cruel in the way that it has a high difficulty curve, you dont get to play against people of your level, there isnt levels. Its you against everyone who is in a server, regardless of skill. The weapons are very difficult to master, and if you play modern era games then this....you will really be in for a bad time. The guns are very slow firing, or needing very reduced accuracy to fire fast as the revolvers follow that. I reccomend this for the special qualities of this game.",

On May 9th this year, my friend recommended me the mod, so I installed it right from my Steam Game Library. I played about 15 minutes of it and left the game alone for awhile... which I am full of regret. I was going to play at least five more hours of the game before posting this review but after playing a few matches, I have to share my review to everyone.   First things first; the game has comedy that is both funny and stupid. (which I think it was intentional) From the corny western voice acting to the ground breaking bugs (I'll get to that later) I love this game. Especially the line; 'Pass the whiskey,' which I died in laughter over. So much I now spam that voice command through out matches, which I hear other people repeat me. The art style is quite confusing what the the Developers were aiming for. Semi-realistc with a mix of the Team Fortress 2 artstyle? I have no idea, but overall this style is interesting. Speaking of which the mod's graphics look very decent, not the best however. This is on Ultra settings and I can still see some 'low-res' textures, which sets the bar for this mod's graphics to not age well. Even Half Life 2 has this same issue, but I am not here to complain; 'OMG THE GRAPHICS ARE BAD!!!11!!1'   Gameplay is solid, four teams, client eastwood style teams, wild western maps, items, and more. I do however have some issues with the gameplay. One thing I have to highlight on is the more weapons you have, the slower you get. It is not like Counter Strike where if you have your knife out you run faster. You always run the same paste, unless you are Shift walking or using your iron-sights. Guns feel pointless just carrying around, as I just mention. I found myself getting more kills by using my throwing knifes and fists.   There was some animation glitches and bugs, such as when reloading a gun at the end of a match my character will spaze out, or this funny glitch where I would jump off stairs and just kill myself, without playing an animation. (Like DayZ lol) There's more bugs, but don't allow that to stop you. Since this game is being updated up the @55 (that's a good thing) hopefully these bugs will be fixed.  In conclusion, I recommended getting this mod. It is a ton of fun to play and it is free! That's right; no “pay to win” bull♥♥♥♥, no micro transactions, and no common trends! I would recommend this to a friend, kind of like my friend did to me. That is all for today, goodbye!",

Oh....and most of the maps are horrible and you can't run.......hey it's free right but it's just a waste of my time I tried to get attached ,but the only way your gonna have much fun is in shootout and I would recommend you may like shootout if you like free-for-all but if not then just don't get this pile of ♥♥♥♥",

Also, sprinting is replaced with kicking, which acts like the Pyro's airblast - this is a good design choice as most of the weapons in this game are most effective at close range (those being shotguns, melee etc.). Further more, aiming is somewhat different in this game as it is about deciding whether to walk, aim accurately at a cost of higher vunerability or runnining which makes your aim poor in exchange for more evasiveness.",

The game is basically a Western Counter Strike. But it's not as hard to get good at. In this game you just have to find the gun your good with and stick with it. Different people use different guns because each gun in this game requires different skill. Some people use the hatchet others use the sniper, becuase that is what skill they have. None of the guns are overpowered. Some people may argue but they are wrong. If you play this game you'll know that you can play with any gun but none of which are OP. The only thing they need to fix in this game is the spawning. It's always a gamble when you spawn. You could be safe or in the middle of 8 enemies. It's completely random.

This is a deathmatch gamemode, so you will respawn.   The great part of this game is that it is so slow moving that it's easy for everyone to learn this game and get decent. This is also a game where you do not depend on a great team. The fact that there are three teams makes it a lot of fun.  Pros:  - Easy to learn. You can catch up with this game quickly if you try.  - Diffrent weapons with diffrent playstyles.  - Diffrent traits.  - Easy to dodge if you aren't reloading or heavy loaded.  - Focused on points and not deaths.  - Weaponcrates around the map.  - Short respawn time.  - Runs on Mac and Linux :D  Cons:  - Sometimes hard to find server with players on.  - Few good gamemodes.

There are boots, which increase speed, guns, which kill things, and melee weapons, which are faster and more accurate than guns.   2-24 players run around in tight-closed maps (which allow for fast paced gameplay a la Unreal Tournament) and shoot at eachother with a whole host of Wild West guns. The real innovation here comes from the right mouse button (respectively), as it can be used for fanning the trigger, ironsights, and dual-barrel firing. There is a kick which can be used during reloading, and a fast switch to bare knuckles when you need them.   The gameplay is exciting, and fast paced, with a very short learning curve. At first, you're figuring out which guns you like best, and before you know it, you're shooting people in the hat for style points. Lots of fun for fans of TF2, Killing Floor, Counter Strike, etc.",

Alright review time, Fistful of Frags is a pure F2P game (meaning no micro transactions) and its gameplay reminds me of CS (regarding the aiming system and hp system) and CoD (regarding its game modes) with a little bit of TF2 sprinkles (Health Packs) and a classic shooters (bigger weapons on the map). Now at first, this game may seem hard to play due to its accuracy system and hp system being similar to CS however it soon becomes clear that this game is a fair bit easier than that game. A small tip is when aiming try to go off and on from walking and crouching, if done correctly, you'll mow down your opponent with perfect accuracy. All the weapons in this game feel balanced and only 2 can one shot to the body at full hp. The health packs, in the form of whiskey, are a risk vs reward senario because once you drink it, your vision starts getting wobbly for a few seconds and worsens with continuous drinks. Overall fabulously fun game 10/10 VOLCANIC PISTOL FTW!",

You can use a revolver in classic cowboy fashion, or if you had a bad day and want to blow off some steam, can pick up a hatchet and throw it at people. Or you could pick up and explosive barrel and run at people with it, hoping they shoot the barrel and not your feet or face. You can kick people into collapsable fencing to send them plummeting to their doom. However, no game is without it's... own issues. For one, the game can be horrifically unbalanced to the point of breaking. There are three chests of differing colors scattered all over the map. The blue chest is the most common, allowing you to pick from a few items you can spawn with. The red chest, which is the middle child, holds slightly more powerful variations of the spawn weapons like the devestating Coach Gun, or my personal favorite, the Peacemaker. The gold chest, which is where the heart of this issue lies, is the biggest chest of them all, and holds the greatest loot. Three weapons can be found here, the Pump Action Shotgun, the Colt Walker Revolver, and the Sharps Rifle. These three weapons are the most powerful in the game, and all pack a punch at their own respective ranges. However, it becomes very easy on some maps for an entire group of people to simply horde all the weapons and camp the one room. This is not as much of a problem in free for all modes, but is a problem in team modes. But nothing a good stick of dynamite can't fix, after all, it wouldn't be the Wild West without dynamite too. However, I fear dynamite is the worst offender of the unbalanced weapons. The item feels like it has no weight, despite the fact that it takes quite a long time to light, and throws a very poor distance. It won't kill a full health player unless they are standing right on it, and even if it is lit there is still that chance that you'll fail to kill them. A unique feature of the dynamite is that after it has been thrown, enemy players can pick it up? What? Pick up and extinguish live dynamite? Despite these glaring issues, the game is very fun. It becomes difficult to knock players off of their high score charts in the late game, but in the beginning anything can happen. The score chart constantly changes with who is where and what rank. I once won a whole round by stealing kills by punching people. Very fun game, and it didn't cost me a dime. It really is a must own.",

            "review_text": "Fistful of Frags is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Following initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more susceptible to common infections like tuberculosis, as well as opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. The late symptoms of the infection are referred to as FFoF, a type of cancer known as Kaposi's sarcoma, or other FFoF-defining conditions.  Fistful of Frags is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit FFoF. Common methods of FFoF prevention include encouraging safe sex, needle-exchange programs, and treating those who are infected. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with FFoF is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the GPU subtype.  Since its discovery, Fistful of Frags has caused an estimated 36 million deaths worldwide (as of 2012). In 2013 it resulted in about 1.34 million deaths. As of 2012, approximately 35.3 million people are living with FFoF globally. Fistful of Frags is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. Genetic research indicates that HIV originated in west-central Africa during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. FFoF was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—GPU meltdown—was identified in the early part of the decade.  Fistful of Frags has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has significant economic impacts. There are many misconceptions about Fistful of Frags such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.",

The only con that I would see is the accuracy (or lack thereof). I pushed that aside because after all, this is a Wild West shooter and the weapons werent very accurate. Other than that, this game is awesome and I recommend it.",
