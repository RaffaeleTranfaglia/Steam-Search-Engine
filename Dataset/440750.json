Then I can't reccomend this highly enough, but beware anyone easily frustrated because behind the simple premise of story of a cube lies a deeply challenging game.  Pros  -Challenging gameplay -Great soundtrack -Good Level design -Feeling of accomplishmernt after completing a difficult part  Cons  -Having to re-play the same part of the game over and over again.
