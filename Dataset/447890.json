The cat doesn't even move, you have to cut wooden blocks to make him fall into the cookie jar, so he can eat his stupid cookies. To prove he's so lazy, if you watch the cookie jar in world 1, there are less cookies in each level. This game is good if you just want to get something for 5 bucks. ",

            "review_text": "You play as an invisible force whose task is to help a cat who is too fat to be able to move to get into the cookie jar on each level, and optionally catch muffins along the way, by breaking wooden boards, using magnets to yank around metal objects, making him travel through baskets etc. Simple enough, easy to get into.  Despite the fact that its core mechanics are not that sophisticated and there are similar free flash games on the Internet, I would still recommend you to pick it up if you like puzzle games involving terrain manipulation. The cat is cute, the graphics are quite nice for a game like this, and while completing the levels isn't usually hard (with a few exceptions), the two additional challenges you get on each level (complete the level with a given amount of clicks, and get all the floating muffins around the map) are hard enough to entertain you for a while.  If nothing else, get it on sale - it is almost free that way.",
