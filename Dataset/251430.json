            "review_text": "A quirky cartoonish adventure game in the classic adventure game style.  Backgrounds are lovely, Character Art is cartoonish but nice. Voice Acting is great and generally Sound is good. Writing is interesting and the dialogue is delightfully 'oddball'.   Keep in mind the bizarre nature of the puzzles will require equally bizarre solutions. 'Pixel hunt' &amp; 'Item Clutter' is never really an issue (hold Spacebar for hotspots). So yeah, you can brute force your way through quite a bit. The hint system is good because it will give you clues (more specific each subsequent time when used on the same puzzle), and doesn't just hand out answers.  This is a quality game at a reasonable price. What isn't to love about this?",

            "review_text": "I've played the first 2 deponia series and also Broken Age. Now onto the inner world and i found this game so much more enjoyable than the deponia series. I also preferred this game over broken age. Eventhough broken age has better graphics and illusration but I was more captivated in this game than broken age. I guess its cause broken age has more of a serious tone? Inner world was funnier and quirkier, therefore i never found any part of the game boring.   The storyline is good, i enjoyed clicking on all the speech bubbles to hear more about the story. Puzzles were logical and understandable not weird and random (unlike some other puzzle games where u randomly just put things together hoping it'll work) Illustration is simple yet attractive, alot of different scenes. The game lasted quite long hence i felt like it was value for money. Overall, if u like funny, cute adventure games with a cute storyline (and cute characters! e.g. gorf &amp; tumblemouse!) then try out this game! i rly enjoyed it!!",
