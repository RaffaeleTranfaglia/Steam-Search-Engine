            "review_text": "Charming and enjoyable. Pretty funny with SFW humor (and appropriate for little kids). The controls are a bit clunky but it's one-of-a-kind within its genre, it's worth trying at least - there's a free demo available that will help you decide. Besides goal-oriented item finding you have a variety of puzzles in every level, from your regular jigsaw to more complex timed or action-based puzzles, all of which you can skip if you want or need to. Very cute graphics.  Give the demo a try, if you are looking for a kids game or if you are a kid at heart, it's likely to get to you. I estimate you will very likely get at least 4-5 hours of gameplay, quite possibly more if you're not aiming to get gold medals in all the levels and skipping everything, so I think the price is pretty acceptable. You should grab it in a heartbeat within a bundle!",

            "review_text": "I am a hardcore strategy gamer. Sometimes I play adventure or even hidden object for a few minutes, but get pretty sick of them. But this one I will keep coming back to until I finish. The 'puzzles' (such as they are) are cute and a bit clever. The cartoonish hidden objects are just enough of a challenge (IMO). The story is pretty funny. It is totally silly, but that is probably actually a 'realism' improvement over most such games ('I desperately need to get through that locked internal wooden door, so naturally I hunt for a key in the cluttered bathroom rather than just breaking it down.')   I would have to say this is the most fun of the adventure-lite/hidden-object genre I have tried.",

            "review_text": "Sweet and Family-Friendly  This casual, hidden-object, point-and-click puzzler is a good choice as an alternative to the 2D hidden object games out there. It's all in 3D modeling, with everything modeled in the same cartoonish fashion so there are no jarring discrepanices. There are a variety of small puzzles and mini-games. The colors are bright and crisp, making the graphics a stand-out. The only drawbacks so far have been an occasional missing menu graphic causing you to wonder what you may have just pushed, and the ever so slightly clunky controls. The plusses outweigh the minuses by far.",

            "review_text": "This game isn't an outright stinker, but it's really not very good. It's an ambitious attempt to make a hidden-object game in a 3D environment, which doesn't entirely fail, but demonstrates that, really, the traditional image-based approach to hidden objects works better.  It wasn't particularly challenging, even on the higher difficulty setting. It might serve better as a kids' game than for adults, but children would probably find a few of the minigames tricky.",
