            "review_text": "Roundabout is one of those games that isn't easy to classify, let alone review. Your friends may also consider you crazy if you describe it to them: 'Well, you're literally spinning around the city in a limo, hitting pedestrians, jumping on rooftops, and blowing ♥♥♥♥ up' - they would probably give you a weird look or two after that.  If we boil it down to the core gameplay, then Roundabout is first and foremost a puzzle game. In fact, the main game mechanic here is inspired by a lesser-known Japanese puzzle game Kuru Kuru Kururin, which is more than 15 years old at this point. But it would be a gross oversimplification just to label Roundabout as a puzzle game, since its much more than that.  Gameplay-wise, you move around the map in a constantly revolving limousine, which is challenge in and of itself, since there are plenty of tight turns and obstacles or hazards in your way, that you'll need to manoeuvre around and avoid respectively, since it takes just three collisions for your limousine to blow up as though it was packed to the brim with explosives. So, timing and precise movement are key here, but you shouldn't really sweat it, since this game is pretty forgiving - blowing up usually isn't that big of deal. You don't really lose when blowing up, outside of various challenges and side-missions.  So why is Roundabout more than just a puzzle game? Mostly because of its story, style and setting. Everything is presented in a style of a 70s B-Movie, with the appropriate story, style of graphics and music — and there's also FMV! It's one of those rare times when cheesy green-screen FMV really feels at home, and having a just a few actors for all of those roles makes it even better. There are also various side-missions and challenges available in Roundabout, usually centered around endurance, collectables for you to find on a pretty big 'open world' map, upgrades and customization options which you unlock (both visual and technical), property aquisition, etc. All of this greatly increases the overall scope of the game, providing a sometimes needed distraction.  With all that, Roundabout creates a very fun and relaxing puzzle game experience, which are pretty rare on the market. It's just the type of game that you need when you want to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Most people probably didn't understand this game, with SteamSpy estimating sales just at 38K copies at the time of this review, but I think you should give it a chance.  P.S.

            "review_text": "TL;DR +Revolving Limousine +Jeffery The Skeleton +FMV +Collectibles +Wicked Sense Of Humor -Technical Issues 10/10  Seriously one of the best games of the year. You play as Geogrio Manos, the world's first revolving limousine driver. The game seems pretty simple until you get into it, because the car will never stop revolving, and you have to manuver through the crazy ♥♥♥♥ this game has lined up for you.   Just to get the negatives out of the way, the game doesn't run great (my computer is garbage), so that's just a problem on my end. Also, whenever I change resolutionsettings, the next itme I start up the game, it's a black screen, so I have to delete the resolution settings EVERY TIME I play the game. I hope that gets fixed.  Now for the long list of positives. The FMV is brilliant. Even in games that I get invested into the story, I usually do skip a cutscene or too if they go on too long or if I just don't care. I've never skipped a cutscene in this game because it's just so funnnnny. The acting in this is really entertaining to watch. The gameplay itself is great. Navigating the maze-like Roundabout City is made difficult when your car continuously revolves, so you have to move quickly and accurately to not go up in flames. The missions are great fun to play, which are always sandwiched between beautiful cutscenes. The story is absurd, and everything about it is just so entertaining. This game is also funnier than most games. The stereotypical characters you pick up in the game are so damn funny, and even the horns, hats, and paint colors even have funny names. You can customize your limousine to have a different paint job, and roof ornament (hats), and to have a different horn (I go with the sleek Hyphen paint job, which makes the entire limo green). The game might be really short if you do nothing but missions, but if you try to get all the collectibles, and do the challenges, then you're gonna have a fun time.  If you think there's a game that is better than this game this year, just think if it has FMV. If it doesn't have FMV, it isn't better than Roundabout.",

Once you start getting into the controls (which can be frustrating a first, but how often do you drive a spinning car?) you can pull off some really neat tricks that leave you grinning.  If No Goblin keeps making games like this, they'll have a customer in me for a long time.  EDIT: Also, I'd really like to say how much I enjoyed the native PS4 controller support.

The presentation is charming and silly, in a harmless, lo-fi, FMV, 'were they all high while making this game?' sort of way. It takes the Kuru Kuru Kururin (google it) gameplay concept of guiding a rotating object (in this case a limousine) across an obstacle course within a time limit and gives this woefully underused old premise an open-world, FMV, funky, cartoonish twist. The result is about just as crazy as it sounds.   The FMV video footage is deliberately cheesy and funny, and it mostly works. The basic gameplay mechanic is solid (as it always has been) and well-implemented in an open-world setting. The whole city turns into a big circus for your freaky car acrobatics! You also learn how to jump! JUMP! The game world is pretty big and sprawling, with multiple unlockable areas, minigames, collectibles and bonuses. Unfortunately the main missions can be played through faster than you can spin your car ten times, but for HC spinning afficionados there are plenty of fun bonuses to unlock to make the most of your time there. I didn't feel compelled to go back after finishing the main story, but I enjoyed my short time with it.  Rating: 8/10",

That, in combination with the odd cutscenes which is all 70's B-movie, makes this a game worth its own weight in gold.  Keep in mind though, this game's weight isn't very high. At least if you just want to play through the storyline and then leave everything to be... then you'll probably complete the game within two hours.

Once I bought it, I played it quite a bit. 'How did I not find this quicker!? This is AMAZING!' I do have one complaint about the game, but I think it's my laptop instead. Whenever I open the game, I hear the words 'No Goblin' and then I get a black screen until I tab out and force close the game using Task Manager. Usualy after about 5-8 goes (some of the later times I see a flicker of blue and hear Disco Inferno, the main menu music) it works but appears as a box in the bottom-middle-right until I set the resolution to Windowed Mode, then Fullscreen (Bordered) and finally Fullscreen (Legacy Mode) otherwise I get the black screen again and have to repeat the process. Despite this, this is one of my favourite games on Steam, no doubt and I would DEFINITELY give this game 5/5 if I didn't have the start-up problems. As for the FMV cutscenes, they are HILARIOUS I definitely reccommend this game, even if you do experiance another 'What The F***!?' moment in your life when you meet Jeffrey The Skeleton. Probably anyone who has unlocked this mission will agree, and when asked will say 'Yeah... That was a weird moment in this game...' I definitely reccommend this game. Nice work guys!",

Your limo will start a mission with a different rotation depending on when you started it, missions that depend on pedestrians or a field of crops will not repopulate those when you restart, the camera will not immediately snap back to the mission start area, sometimes your limo will spawn sunken in the ground or in the air and exploding (EVERY TIME during map transitions), and a few other problems.  Other things that really reduced my enjoyment of the game include colliding with the slope the limo is sitting on, the limo sinking into the ground and colliding with a cliff I drove off because it starts falling when the center of the limo is off the ground, and cutscenes playing on mission restart and sometimes being unskippable. Also, some things stopped working until I restarted the game - missions would stop registering that I completed them with a continuous streak, and once, the menu stopped allowing me to choose anything.

The gimmick of this game is that you are a limousine driver who is constantly rotating. Thankfully, in the town of Roundabout, all roads, cars, and other obstacles are laid out just perfectly for you to snake around to get people to their destinations. The game is as casual or as serious as you want it to be. There are lofty objectives and super-pro highscore boards, but if you explode in a fiery wreck, you'll start back up nearby in a jiffy. Additional mechanics and challenge are layered on slowly, and getting through the game I feel is pretty attainable.  The characters and video are the real delight of this game, though. Taking place in the 1970s, various employees of the developer's company don silly costumes and deliver so-bad-it's-good lines of dialog. Of note is that the player plays Georgio Manos, a silent protagonist whose primary role in the game is turning (with slight variation) from the steering wheel to see who hopped in her car. Yet she is still very compelling!  Hammy? Yep. Self-aware? Oh yeah. Hilarious? Georgio gets caught up in dark alleyway billionaire deals, a fierce rotating limo rivalry, budding love, and drug addiction, among many other weird scenarios. That's a yes.  If you're up for a laugh in the B-movie style, I highly recommend Roundabout.",

You'll take role of Georgio Manos (Kate Welch) who just got her licence to drive a limo... in a new way (because normal driving is too mainstream).  Gameplay is all about driving a limo that's constantly spinning. I hope you haven't even expected some realistic play, because there isn't any - it's made to be entertaining and hard by its own way. You don't control the car from the position of the driver, you just choose the direction it should drive. That doesn't mean it's easy, it's actually pretty hard, the game will lead you to many puzzling situations where you'll have to use proper timing for all driving. To help that, you can use several skills like time slow down.  While the story is linear, between mission it's all about your driving in the open world (cities). Mission selection is based on driving (well, spinning) to specific place - that usually makes you stop at many places nearby, doing side missions and challenges.   What's outstanding, are the cutscenes. They are made in 70s style with a lot of silly and funny dialogues, it doesn't even take itself much seriously. And neither you will take it seriously, considering there's nothing normal in the game - all you'll do is watching great cutscenes, spinning through the checkpoints, running over people and jumping.   And that's what, in the end, made me disappointed. While I love the acting and whole sillyness, after about half an hour the gameplay feels too much boring and frustrating. I'd like to see this gameplay in some other (bigger) game as a funny minigame but building around this mechanism a whole game isn't something I could appreciate.  What's also a big disappointment is the length of the game. If you won't hunt for highscores and achievements, you can expect less than 3 hours of gameplay. ( I haven't finished it as I asked for refund, but you can check other reviews and howlongtobeat for this piece of information. )  Some people might be surprised by the hardware requirements in compare to other casual games. I haven't got much performance problems overall but there were places with bigger amount of light effects which sucked most of my FPS (and it couldn't get turned off in the settings).  I understand why so many people like this game, though I haven't got the same impression. I feel like I would rather watch all those cutscenes made into a silly 'Roundabout: The Movie' than to play it with gameplay that spins me round and round... which is not entertaining for a long time.",
