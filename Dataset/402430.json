            "review_text": "I've now put quite a few hours into OOTP 17 now since buying it in July so I can now fairly give a review and also compare to last years OOTP 16. First thing I noticed different from last year was the design and colors of the screens. Much better imo and easier to read. Something else that is much improved over last years game is the trading. You can actually now make a list of needs you are wanting so the computer makes more offers to you making the game more realistic in that area. Now I'm not saying the trades are easier to make, I still always get the they want two five star players for their 4 star and 3 star thing happening but overall this new function really adds to the game.   Now to just go over the game in general and not comparing to last years game. If you like baseball and sims you will absolutley LOVE this game. The options to starting leagues are never ending. There is almost nothing you can't make your league into with all the options given. You can base a league on current MLB seasons, historical MLB seasons. You can dump all the MLB players into a pool and draft them into new teams. You can start fictional leagues. You can decide on whether its an offensive league, pitching league or neutral league. You can start foreign leagues. It's endless.  The interface can be a bit tricky to learn to start but after a bit it starts to fall into place for you as things are designed well for the most part. My biggest complaint about the game is when setting individual player game strategies you can't always see all the players stats needed to adjust you strategies. Otherwise they have done a great job on making sure you can almost always find what you are looking for easily after a bit of practice.  I highly recommend this game to baseball fans and sim fans, you can't do any better than this game. If you are wanting to learn more about basebal I also recommend this game as well, so much can be learned while playing the game, it won't take long before you know you've improved your baseball IQ.",

Also auto-post game wrteups is reat and it makes everything go smoother. And the 3D animations that move while the games are being simmed are a nice touch too.

If you want to play out the current season to see if you can do better than your team's management, you can do that. If you want to experience the likes of Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig and Ducky Medwick, you can do that. Play out the 1919 world series and see if the Reds can pull off the win without the Black Sox selling out. You can even see how JR Richard, Steve Carlton, Roy Halladay, and Bob Gibson would fair against Ruth, Gehrig and Williams.   If you just like the idea of managing your own dynasty and writing your own history you can create your own fictional baseball universe where only you get to know the players.   You can do all this in a solo game but you can take it to the next level by either starting your own or joining one of the many online leagues where you can compete against other baseball geeks.   It's your game and you play it however you wish. Besides the intricacies and nuances of the game you get every player that has played in the MLB along with over 150,000 real minor league players and they all come with the game, no season's to buy. Best sports simulation that I have ever played from a small company dedicated to making it the best that it can be. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

            "review_text": "There's no deeper baseball simulation out there today unless you manage to get a job in a MLB front office. I've been mildly addicted to the franchise for years and this is another great outing but where it really excels is how the customization options allow for the creation of fantastic stories. The forum on the OOTP website is awash with stories of baseball leagues incorporating the fiction of Fallout(complete with occasional deaths from radiation, drug addiction, and deathclaws), Tolkien(orcs make surprisingly good catchers), Star Wars(Wookie umpires, don't argue with them), or spurring users to create totally new(though probably derivative) fictional universes. If that appeals to you check it out, I can almost guarantee it'll be money well spent for a baseball fan. What follows is a brief story from my first OOTP 17 game. Relatively brief anyway. The universe is mostly ours but the major pro baseball league is the United Nations Baseball League featuring 32 teams, 16 in the Americas(North American Pro League-DH), 16 in the Pacific Rim(Pan-Asian Super League-No DH) each league features four divisions of four teams each, division winners make the playoffs. No interleague play because well the travel would be sort of ridiculous.  I started with an opening draft where I'll be guiding my Perth Koalas as GM so I'm relying on the AI to handle the gameday management under manager Shugo Endo. Notable players include local boy Adrian Wall(1B), power hitting Jordan Najera(C), the 22 million dollar man Jesus Suarez(CF), the all-around excellent Alex Ozeguera(RF), and team leader Andy Varner(OF). Despite all those position players the real power is on the mound, where I spent our first three picks on starters Rickey O'Dowd, Mike Davis, and the great Canadian hope Willard Hayward, we also have one of the best closers in the league in Jose Reyes a 21 year old fireballer out of Cuba and a top notch setup guy in Ryan Nance. So that team sounds pretty good, what's the problem? Glad you asked.  For starters this GM does not like his manager and most of these players have their own fatal flaws, such as defense Wall, Suarez and Najera would all be better suited to DH work, the guys I have to play defense to shore up these niggling issues like Varner cannot hit period. One of the great things about OOTP(sorry this probably belonged up top) is that you'll see two sets of players ratings, one regarding the view of the league at large and one for your scout's opinion, those two will start to converge, but with that opening draft I'll find myself wondering how much to trust my scout and how much his opinion differs from that of the league in general and I'll be repeating the process in amateur drafts. This is a problem for my Perth Koalas because Varner, our shortstop Davon Jones, and outfield prospect Freddie Kozak are among many players where my scout thinks they are way better than the league does.  Luckily pitching cures a lot of ills and with 4 of our top 6 draft picks in the rotation O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Darren Fyfe are cleaning up while fifth starter Frank Rosales is performing above expectations, it helps that Reyes is mostly unhittable and Suarez is playing like the best outfielder on our side of the Pacific. There are injuries to deal with but the first two months of the season sees us pulling away from our division rivals the Melbourne Emus, Brisbane Dragoons, and Taipei Liberty, competing with the Beijing Reds(amusingly because of the name the Reds initially were setup to play in the Great American Ballpark) for the best record in the PASL. Injuries popped up from time to time, but mostly involved our mediocre left field situation(starter Nick Bailey has a .302 OBP and his backup Kenichi Takeuchi hits .217) until the chaos started. A few relievers started to get hurt, annoying but something I can work around as long as the rest of the staff is healthy. The biggest issue was losing talented middle reliever Soetsu Tanaka for the season, but hey at least he isn't Nance or Reyes. Then Reyes blows out his arm, he'll need Tommy John surgery and the man had a 0.99 ERA at the time. Okay, going into June without 2 of our top 3 relievers, As long as Nance is still around and the rotation's intact. We keep on plowing through the PASL, seven all-stars O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward Suarez, Najera, Wall and our third baseman Johnathan Lugo. Our lead in the division is from 15-20 games for months, we are dominant. How dominant, well aside from the massive divisional lead for almost a month Najera and Suarez were in the top five in the league in homers. What I'm saying is that things are good Nance is filling in admirably for Reyes, my biggest problem is that my potential free agents want to be paid and for some reason they want to be paid in American dollars not Australian ones. Najera, leading the league in homers- 20 mil(currently making 10) Aaron Biles(2B) leading the team in average and OBP- 10 mil(currently making 1.4) Suarez(CF) best all around player and fastest man around- not interested doesn't like manager Shugo Endo Then actual problems started. In late July we lose O'Dowd, down for the O'Season. Which means I need more starters and Frank Rosales the initial 5 starter has been traded away because his personality description is literally 'Clubhouse cancer. The kind that gets managers fired' I'm not a fan of Endo, but with Suarez wanting out of Australia I need this clubhouse functional, this may very well be our best shot for a championship for years. The only counter to Rosales' disruptive influence is Varner and he's hovering around or below .200, so I shipped out Rosales for reliever Hideki Sato in early June.  Now O'Dowd's gone and I could really have used Rosales right about now instead of an expendable middle reliever. Luckily the lead we've built up is so massive that it won't matter in the division, but in the postseason I wanted to be able to line up O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Fyfe, now it's Davis, Hayward, Fyfe, and some random dude. That's an issue and it's late July so I have five days to look into a replacement. Nobody's available for a reasonable price, so I figure you can win with two and a half dominant pitchers, especially as long as Nance's healthy. In mid-September(after we clinched) Nance goes down for the season. Sato, that guy I got for Rosales in early June is our new closer and he has about a week to settle into it before the playoffs. We win the division with 93 wins, ending the season on a 7 game losing streak and in the process lose Nick Bailey the good left fielder and Ozeguera(RF hitting .298) picks up a nagging back injury that'll last a couple of weeks. Ozeguera can play but he'll be hampered.  So we start the playoffs against the 92 win Yokohama Anglers without our best left fielder, best starter, 3 of our top 4 relievers, and with our right fielder constantly complaining about tightness in his back. This isn't ideal. To digress a little this is one of the things that makes OOTP great, in a game like XCOM if you lost that many major soldiers going into the endgame you might reload an earlier save or just start a new game, in OOTP you keep going because there's always another season and maybe just maybe our leadership crew of Varner(hitting .188), Sato(new to closing), and Endo(despised by our star CF) can hold it together and pull off a Grand Championship Series win. Davis starts game one and we immediately hand him a three-run lead, then the offense stops. Yokohama scores one in the seventh, eighth and ninth to tie. Sato's first save chance is also his first blown save. Unfortunately Endo has pulled Suarez, Wall, Ozeguera, and Najera so we don't have any offense left. In the eleventh both teams score two. It goes to the fifteenth before we win on a walkoff slam from Lugo(3B). Only 11 wins to go. If you read through all of this, sorry it's longer than I thought it would be, but I think you get what I'm saying.",

I like that both the authentic emblems and the authentic major and minor league system rosters are intact. The simulation between days or games is a quick process. What I would like for the game is the upgrade in ball placement around the field. The statistics for defense should be more of an accurate read on the game. And, the 3d view should show more of an detailed improvement. Overall I think this game is a good buy both for those baseball fans who love moding their teams from top to bottom and casual fans who like to have fun as a GM, Manager or both.",

It required far more time and patience than I was willing to give it, and after 7h, I was still unable to figure out the results of most of my choices. Feedback is very weak. Both the games I played through, I was stopped because my team had weak leadership and I couldn't figure out how to resolve it. Leadership is not a stat which was ever presented to me. After some Googling, you're apparently supposed to look through players bios to see who likes to play pranks, because they're leaders and prevent bad team chemistry. ??? Bad feedback systems.  Actual baseball games lack any excitement, which is about how I remember real baseball (this is probably a factor worth considering in this review - I'm not the target demo!). You're there to improve averages, so games don't count for much given how many there are (the primary benefit of micromanaging games is it sort of helps you understand how numbers translate to play - but again, feedback is very weak), and once they're boiled down to a fatalist game of probabilities, it feels particularly hollow.  I've never encountered a game demanding I do so much observing and testing for such great lengths of time for so little mechanical information. -But it's the best sports simulator I've played, by far, and it reminded me a lot of the fun I had when I was using NREL's System Advisor Model, given they have a near-identical GUI.",
