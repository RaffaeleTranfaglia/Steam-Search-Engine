            "review_text": "I played the Yawhg a couple of times, and I must say it is quite an amusing game. It's all pretty straight-forward: you and/or your friends each choose a character (you can also choose characters yourself and play the game on your own) and choose a location you wish to go to. Each location has a couple of options on actions you can perform, such as cutting wood, tending to patients, and yes, even getting drunk! But beware: each choice you make might positively or negatively affect your stats. After a couple of turns, the mysterious Yawhg happens and each person will have to choose a role which fits their character's stats best (or you can do the opposite, and watch the outcome!), after which you'll get to know whether your town survived, and -more importantly- how your characters pick up their life again afterwards.  The Yawhg is a funny little game which you can play with friends. The graphics are all really fitting and nice, the music is simple, yet suits the game and the absolute highlight of the game is the amount of choices you can make, and the randomnized events you'll encounter. However, the game is VERY short. Almost too short. And that, in my humble opinion, is the only thing where it falls short, for me personally. However, the replay value is very big.   Get it during a sale, or if you like experimental choice-heavy little games like this one.  All in all, 7/10",

I, personally, go to games based on their stories. Seeing this one tagged 'Story Rich' caught my attention, and I figured, 'Hey, why not give it a go?'. I was extremely disappointed.. It was not at all exciting. Overall, it just felt flat and boring. The only things I really felt were at all worth it about this game were the music and the art style. The compositions were impressive, but that was the extent of my satisfaction with the game. I suppose this game could be fun if you invited over a couple of friends and played it drunk with people, but still, I would not recommend investing the $10 on this game... It's just not worth it.",

            "review_text": "I've played The Yawhg twice on my own and twice with a friend and had a blast every time! It's a really simple concept: something bad's going to happen in six weeks, but you're not going to worry about that, there's hunting to do in the forest, patients to tend at the hospital, and malicious hedges to confront! You play a minimum of two characters (up to four) playing with friends is as easy as passing the keyboard (or controller) back and forth. Gameplay is simple, you choose an area of the city that you want to spend your week at, and then you choose what you want to do at that location. For instance, at the palace, you can choose to do administration work or attend a ball. Each activity will raise different stats (physique, finesse, charm, mind, magic, wealth). Random events at each location will also raise or lower certain stats, often, you will be asked to make a choice during these events. Whether you pass or fail seems to depend on stats some of the time and on random rolls other times. The game mixes comedy and horror in a way that reminds me of Welcome to Night Vale with a pinch of Princess Maker 2 and the art style of Don't Starve or a Roald Dahl book. It's funny, dark, and at times very disturbing, and it frequently flip flops between funny and horrifying moments in the space of seconds (the endings are particularly prone to this). Yes, The Yawhg is pretty short, a single playthrough can take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes (or longer if you're playing with friends) and you will be seeing repeat events quite often, but the game has a ton of different endings, and each playthrough tells a different story.  In short, if you like interactive fiction, a bit of comedy with your horror, or maybe you're just looking for something unique, The Yawhg is well worth the full price.",

Are they kidding? What on EARTH makes them think a random game with little gameplay involved is going to be worth 10 dollars?  Here's the game. You pick anywhere from 1-4 characters. You send them to a random location, get a random stat increase, which, considering there is no battle system whatsoever, is merely to decide how successful you are at future random stat increases... then 6 turns later, you choose a profession for your character(s), and the game decides if you were lucky enough to merit a happy or sad ending. Pretty lame, huh? Control wise? If you alt tab out of the game to lower the volume because the music gets really dull after awhile, the game crashes. And there is no option to mute in game. In fact, no option menu at ALL! You can play it, or play something else. This game doesn't WANT to be muted or windowed or any of that. That is frankly, an insult to gamers. I should be able to reduce the loud volume of your game. That's just standard practice, you terrible programmers you.  Look, for further reasons not to get this game? Zoe Quinn is listed in their thank you section when you complete the game. If that isn't a reason to run far the hell away from this game, I don't know what is. Don't even bother to wait for a sale, no amount of money makes this worth a look. Even at a 90% discount, you're still looking at a buck for this, and a buck is like 99 cents too expensive for a 10 minute reading exercise. It's not even worth the trading cards.

            "review_text": "This game is a great example of how there are no true quality metrics in video game design. Graphics? This game is entirely un-animated and the still images consist completely of low-res cartoons. Gameplay? You pick options off a menu. Music? One guitar. Story? You will finish it in less than a half hour.  And yet The Yawhg is probably worth twice its $10 asking price. In a market saturated with 'gameplay advancements,' '4K resolution,' 'roleplaying elements,' and hundred-hour lengths, very few game developers stop to ask themselves whether they are using these tools to do something worth doing. The Yawhg does something worth doing and does not need any of these tools to do it.  To nitpick the game's description, The Yawhg is not a 'Choose Your Own Adventure.' Choose Your Own Adventure books very rarely had multiple main characters or stats to track. The Yawhg is a /Gamebook,/ and while these were great fun in the 80s before we had real branching-path video games, today this is the best possible format for the medium. The Yawhg is a perfect example of the synergy of right tools and right task, and it is worth the time of anyone who enjoys a good interactive story. I suppose you might call this a visual novel -- I don't know, really, I feel like genre has become largely irrelevant in describing video games.  The story of The Yawhg is different every time you play it, so I can't comment on its quality universally, but if you find yourself telling a story you don't care for, it will only last for 20 more minutes. Suck it up and then start a new one. I still recommend you finish the playthrough, however, because what comes to pass may surprise you.  More like this, please, industry. More like this.",

            "review_text": "Initially, when I first heard of this game, I just figured, 'hey, this looks kinda neat but I'm not paying $10 for it becuase I'm a lousy cheap-â™¥â™¥â™¥.' It looked like a cool concept to me and if it looks like a cool concept to you, then you're perhaps in for something of a treat.  Now, when I first played it on my own, I wasn't particularly entertained. I mean, yes, the different story paths were somewhat interesting and the various different endings were kinda cool but I wasn't really absorbed into it. It was just something I used to make a good 45 minutes pass by one day when I was feeling bored. Then, while with some friends the other night, I decided to pull it out because we all needed a game to play and this just so happened to be multiplayer and seemed like a nice change of pace from the usual stuff we always tend to play (e.g. Genital Jousting, Jackbox Party Pack, etc.) What I didn't expect was for us to keep playing over and over again for several more hours, as we found ourselves unusually entertained by this strange little game.  This is because where The Yawhg shines is in its multiplayer gameplay. As you each play through the runs as your individual character, you become attached to the story and are actually quite affected by the events that happen to you. Trying not to spoil any of the specific events as that would take away from your game experience overall, I will say that each event is quite interesting when it first happens. You feel fear, shock, and surprise as you're faced with various choices, unsure of their meaning or where they lead but finding yourself satisfied by the game's clever use of various fantasy cliches to create a coherent story for your character. But it's in this that the game's largest flaw lies. See, there's only a limited number of events that occur, and, though the game is likely designed to be played in sets of multiple consecutive runs, after a few playthroughs you start to see events repeat and they lose the impact that they originally had on the player. No longer does the story really have any sort of impact, and instead you begin picking choices just to try to get a different ending and experimenting, skipping through the game's incredibly creative dialogue and just rushing through each run. It's still enjoyable in a way, but it's a much less interesting experience as the game goes on and on which I was disappointed by to some extent.  The gameplay itself is quite simple. The game is more or less a choose-your-own-adventure book, and thus you play it by simply making choices on where to go, what to do, and how to react to the random event that always occurs. The gameplay is there to simply give the player choice, immersing them in the story that the game crafts and presents, and in that regard it succeeds. I truly don't think this game is for everyone, and if you're the type of person who's driven by a 'win-lose' sort of mindset then this game might not necessarily appeal to you in terms of how it plays, because the enjoyment is not through feeling as though you 'won' the game. It's through that feeling of autonomy and choice, the decision it grants that makes the player feel unique and able. It does, essentially, what it's supposed to do. The characters will recieved stat boosts that affect their decisions throughout the course of each run, and once you learn what different actions give you then there is some thinking that may go into character building in whatnot, but it's really not sophisticated enough to become the main draw of the game.  Graphically the game is quite appealing. The art is drawn cute but not excessively so, and the visuals are primarily presented in a still-painting format that simply serves to accompany the text as opposed to distracting from it, which I thought was a good design decision. The art style is haunting in a way, matching the somber yet somehow mildly humorous nature of this game. Truly, The Yawhg is not a particularly happy game, and it may give you chills if you're not ready for some of what it presents, and the art style adds greatly to this. Musically, the game has a very relaxing, quiet soundtrack, but I was bothered by the fact that often times it consisted of little 6-second loops playing over and over again as the players went through their days. It accompanies the game well enough but the fact that I could hear it looping was quite bothersome. However, there is a full track that plays at the end and beginning of every run that is so intensely haunting and emotional that my friends and I all found ourselves quite affected by it playing.  Essentially, the Yawhg is not a game that you'll find yourself playing very often if you do decide to buy it, which is something that you probably should keep in mind when making your purchase. Rather, it's a game that you'll pull out from time to time when you have enough time to forget many of the random events and are able to experience them fully again. Also, it's WAY better with friends. Trust me.",

The problem is that this really shouldn't be a paid product. The Yawhg feels and plays like a free flash game, and ironicly is no where near as good as other Flash games of this type.   Unlike the interactive fiction games you find on Kongrigate The Yawhg isn't really a single player game, rather is basicly a digital Cards vs. Humanity type experience (i hope that makes sense). The Yawhg is turnbased, with each turn repersenting a week Players take turns selecting what they will do on any given week, after 7 weeks a great disaster (the titualr Yawhg) will befall the city and using the skills you've learned throughout the last 7 weeks will try to repair the town in the best way you can. the idea being that the event's pre-Yawhg will be so wacky that players will be able to laugh and have a good time and all the post-Yawhg stuff will be really sad and dramatic. In practice though it's horibly broken, the way the game is structured with it's stat system means that after about one playthrough you'll have no problem easily maxing out a stat to win at the end. This would be fine if the random events at the core of the game kept you guessing, but they don't. Not because there bad or anything but because there are so few of them. I bet that if you played the game with four players one you would see everything this game had to offer. So in other words the game has no replay value what so ever and in the end for a game that costs $10 that's unacceptable.  It may sound like The Yawhg is the worst thing ever but it's not. It clear that the developers put a lot more heart and soul into it then... other games *cough* Call of Duty *cough* and i would love to see a game like this with a lot more random events. But The Yawhg just feels unfinished, both as a regular video game and as the party based experience it WANT'S to be. Meaning i can't recomend playing 10 or even 1 dollers on The Yawhg, becing as it clearly shouldn't be a paid product.  Nice art though.",

There you will get a random event with two choices, which will have a certain effect on the character that can increase or decrease stats. At the end of the game, the last choice you make is weighed against the stats to see what happens.  Where this game shines however is in how everything interacts. The choices are fairy-tale like whimsical, and as you play it you realise everything interconnects, so you are actually building a short but internally coherent story, that can be different every time.  The game also has a really beautiful and fitting soundtrack. It is not offered on Steam alas, but you can find it on Bandcamp. I definitely recommend picking it up, too.  HOWEVER, and it's potentially big problem for the full price -- the game is short. You will have seen almost all it has to offer in four or five ten-minute playthroughs.

However, the game is less interested in providing a compelling story than it is in demonstrating how the choices we make in life accumulate and ultimately create a story for us that makes sense only in retrospect. The relative meaninglessness of the stats in the game reflects the meaninglessness of our 'stats' in our lives. At the end of the day, our lives are equally defined by choices and events beyond our control, and these both with have impacts on our lives and also the life of the community we inhabit.

The game instead focuses heavily on the story and world interactions your choices create. The in depth details in The Yawhg are astounding with many in-game events big and small, hidden in obscure event pathways, based entirely on the skills you have bult up for your characters. But because of skill and day limitations it may become extremely tiresome for many players to try and see some of the Yawhgs more inner secrets, as they may accidentally trigger a event to occur earlier than they wished, or even a different event than what is wished for to occur. The main thing to keep in mind though when purchasing this game is this: Do you have any friends who live near you? If yes then The Yawhg is a great game to play as its couch co-op focus can make for a fun and eventful time. If not and you also have no means of streaming events to friends and playing that way, you will find yourself playing a game for four on your ownsome, and as fun as the game can be, playing it by yourself can be a very tiresome experience.

What your character becomes is a reflection of how you play it, and trust me, there's some really great twists and turns to the game.  My favourite part is that what one player does directly influences what happens to the other, thus making it a team game.

The game is essentially for 1-4 players, each taking their turn of where to go during the week, what to do at said location, and how you respond to a random event. This process lasts for several weeks, around 6 or 8 I believe, before the 'Yawhg' comes. After the Yawhg comes, the game sums up your ending randomly. While fun, witty, and comedic, the 'adventure' that players go through is drastically short and is merely based on week to week events rather than the accumulative story. For $9.99 I would say the game is extremely short (lasting around 5-15 minutes depending on how fast you can read) and I would recommend it as a nice steam summer sale pick up. Other positive notes include pretty artwork, interesting scenarios, and a short-lived entertaining adventure game. I would give it a 5 out of 10.",

A concept that could easily be poorly done, boring, uninspiring. But The Yawhg is none of those things. Each game session is short - about ten minutes - a length that feels right, yet also leaves you (me) wanting more. So I play it again, this time making different decisions. And then again. And again. Were I to classify this game, it would be interactive fiction, or rather, interactive storytelling. Storytelling, to me, isn't as detached as 'fiction.' A storyteller is there, talking to you, weaving a story, involving you in a different way than fiction (and I mean reading fiction when I say fiction). Both inspire your imagination and involve you in the story, but one - to me - is more personal, one makes you feel more like you helped tell the story. Thus why I think interactive storytelling is more fitting. The gameplay is sort of like ... simulation games that involve making a choice of what you do that week from various tasks, each one of them raising certaain stats . Princess Maker 2, Long Live the Queen, Spirited Heart -- games that have similar gameplay in that regard - but The Yawhg is not like any of those games in other respects. Just the mechanic of picking an activity that raises (or lowers sometimes) stats.  At the end of the game, depending on the events that happened, you find out what your choices ultilmately lead to. What consequences or benefits they had. And you're told about the effects on the individual characters as well.  That's a pretty rough descripton of the The Yawhg. Not because I described it poorly, but no decritption can convey the experience of this game. I loved the art style and find it very fitting for the themes and story. I loved he writing, which this focusing on story telling, that's a good thing to love. Every aspect is equal in quality and the quality is outstanding. I'm stating this so it's clear I am not intending to say anyone is more responsible for The Yawhg being the work of art that it is. I love music. Music is key for me when it comes to developing atmosphere and evoking emotions. So with that in mind, the music of The Yawhg is so well done. I loved everything about the score (and the game, like I said, I'm music oriented, so think of this is being for all those people who thrive off music. I know people who thrive off writing in the same way I thrive off music, and I can tell you every aspect of this game is in harmony and I hope if the deveopers were to read this, that it wouldn't come across as me downplaying all the oher aspects of the game. Super important to me, obviously, which is why I keep restating it.)  The song that plays during the end sequence is ... I can't imagine a song that would sound more fitting. It's a beautiful song and ...   All I can say is, if you like storytelling and interactive fiction/storytelling, and can enjoy a game that is short (but has a lot of replayability), I recommend this game with every recommending bone (it's a thing..) in my body. It's a work of art and everyone who worked on this -- I thank you for making this and giving it (releasing) to the world to experience and enjoy and if all of you decide to colloborate again - I'll buy whatever you make. And I'll be watching out for projects in general that involve any of the developers/etc that worked on this game.   IN SHORT, I give this the highest recommendation I can.",

The characters are unaware that the Yawhg, a fabled source of great destruction, is coming their way. The players get to decide how these unsuspecting characters spend their last six weeks: select one of eight locations and one of two actions for that character to take part in during that week. The chosen action, along with random events that might trigger, will alter the character's stats. One characters' actions might trigger or help explain events encountered by other characters; they might even begin a questline that can be followed or ignored.  The game has multiple endings based on all of these factors. Although there are a limited number of permutations, enough can happen that no single playthrough has felt the same as another.

It's playable by anybody, has a strong narrative, delightful consequences, and a solid ending all in a short session. While the first time is always the best, it does have some replayability.  If the premise tempts you at all, go for it. If you need more specifics, it's a collaborative short story of small choices that build individual character stats and the groups overall stats affect the resolution of the narrative. No reflex based game play, just menu choices for each player. The game shines with how the narratives collaborate and how some choices come back to haunt everyone.  Grab four controllers and play up the dramatic sense of impending doom for best effect.",

You have 6 turns to live your life before the disaster of the YAWGH hits and you choose your role to rebuild the city.  Last time i played one of the players got bite by a vampire became the town drunk and built a vampire cult under the city.  The gameplay there is none really expect choice on where to go and what to do. it's a nice little game but if your a big into gameplay or combat games you may not like this.",

            "review_text": "When I'm over at a friend's house and i introduce this game, friends tend to be very reluctant. 'The Yog? Th fuq is dis shet?' but after convincing and non-consensual involvement in gameplay, there is always laughter and merriment to ensue.   The Yawhg is a fantastic game for up to four friends. Sometimes you start to notice some repetition but there is plenty of variation available. It is very simple to follow and good way to get people in a good mood or distracted from their bad mood.   I personally love the game because I like to watch my friends interact in the this unique world set in a pre-apocolyptic short adventure while I narrate and voice the various characters.   The game itself is basically the backstory for your character that effects the various character traits (charisma, mind, wealth, ect.) that help play your roll after the Yawhg arrives, a all-destroying natural disaster in which you and few others survive. the end of the games tells you how you fair after the distruction settles. Good or bad, it is painted on a canvas with light-heartedness that kind makes you say 'well alrighty then.'  It's a small game great for passing time with friends but its not a 7-hour-plus rpg. games last between 5-20 mins. One thing is for sure, the writers wanted you to be surprised around every corner so don't expect a boring game... beacuse... well, you won't get one...  I really should have thought through this ending here... well... bye  ",

            "review_text": "This is an unique kind of party game that you don't find anywhere else. Rather than a party game where you have mindless fun and game, this is a game where you and your friends take on a role and roleplay together. As such, it is a really good roleplay game, where all of the actions have direct or/and indirect consequences and changes the outcome of the game. With every playthrough, every decision and consequences differs, and so every playthrough is unique in it's own way. The art-style is nice, the music (albeit repetitive) suits the mood, the gameplay is simple and engaging, and when played with friends, i have no doubt that it'll be a fun party game, possibly even better when drunk.  As a single player game however, it completely lacks any kind of weight. This is the reason why i cannot recommend this to anyone who does not have a friend to play couch co-op with, because that is the only way this game is meant to be played. 0.2 hours is all that it takes for me to finish one playthrough, and that's with me reading every single text. It's really short, really shallow as well, and does not leave a lasting impression. Like i mentioned before, this game is meant to be played with other people, who will contribute their own depths to the story. Playing it alone however, means that there's nothing much to do, except absentmindedly pick choices and read the consequences, alone.  I want to love this game, because this kind of game with choices, branching story, consequences that impacts the story, and character building, but there's not enough for me to love about this game  TL;DR if you have someone to go couch co-op with, i would recommend buying it. If you don't have, don't buy this.",
