You are on a quest to gather riches, and to find a suitable final resting place for the king. Beautiful graphics also make this game a high reccomendation :) You can also grab a player 2 to join you and help you gather more precious jewels *I have yet to know how I can rate 2 player games* But I bet it would be great! Excellent game :)   CONTROLLER HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!! :)",

It turned out to be really fun to play and had the right amount of challenge (and yelling at your co-op partner when doing the optional tricky treasure hunts). I've only played co-op and I didn't finish the whole game yet so I can't answer for singleplayer, but the gameplay is pretty straightforward. It's a physics puzzle game built around pulling a cart with a rope or two. You can unlock stuff inbetween stages when you find the parts for it in the levels and collect enough treasure. The levels are quite big and the artstyle is cute. Not sure how long the game is but we did everything we could find in each level so far and I think it took about 40 minutes or more per stage. I'm happy I bought it in any case!",

There are hints flashed on the screen while a level is loading, I can't read a complete sentence in one second, how about leaving them on the screen a bit longer.   I'm sure I could have figured out all the rules of the game, but gameplay is so mediocre I didn't feel motivated to do so.",
