Can't wait to continue blasting my way through this one. Very appreciative of all the save points throughout the level, kinda disappointed leaving the game means starting over at the beginning of the level though ... Took a while to get used to the keyboard controls ... haven't tried it on an xBox 360 controller yet ... interested in hearing how people enjoy this great platformer with that (standard) controller.",

            "review_text": "I'll admit I bought this game because I'm a fool for retro-ish commercials and it was only $1.69. I love the videos on the game's store page. It's like I'm back in the early 90s again. But I can't give a very in-depth review since I haven't played long but thought I'd give a small criticism since it's still fresh in my mind. One issue with this game and some retro-ish games is that the distinciton between passive/background elements and active/foreground elements isn't always very distinguished so sometimes when playing, as a new player, I don't always know what blocks or objects I can interact with and what I can't. But other than that, unless I edit this review later, I recommend this game if you're looking for a simple, fun, retro-style game and have a few bucks to spare.",

            "review_text": "Old-school style platformers seem to be all the rage with indie devs. They don't require massive teams of people to create and their low CPU usage results in a wider audience getting to experience the game. Sometimes, though, you just have to wonder if going retro was the best choice.  With Terrian Saga: KR-17, there doesn't seem to be any real defining feature. This is a game based on the likes of MegaMan or old Apogee MS-DOS titles. It's an action platformer with a greater emphasis on platforming. These levels will require you to search for keys to progress; just like the good-old-days.  Still, there really isn't much to it. You find keys, shoot enemies and progress. The game routinely stops to give you frustratingly difficult boss battles, but even those end up being too short. The game breezes by without much of a care.  I suppose that could be noted as a plus, but I never felt invested in this game. The sprite work is fantastic, but the art style puts me off. It looks like a 5 year old's drawings of a 'cool' robot he saw. This is almost like if Wall-E got fed up with cleaning the Earth.  The choice of weapons is almost entirely moot, too. While you have access to a bomb, a remote bomb, a claymore and flamethrower, you really only ever need the bomb. It has the most use, deals the most damage and can be lobbed a great distance. Nothing else really matters, apart from a failed attempt at diversity.  Your core blaster even works quite well against every enemy. One foe requires you to dodge when shooting it, but you could take advantage of the invincibility frames and mutilate him. Nearly all the adversaries are the same, too. Just shoot, shoot and shoot some more.  Do I really find the game that unenjoyable? No, honestly. The music is excellent and the level design, itself, is solid. I love old-school style games that require you to remember routes and plan out a perfect path. KR-17 has that in spades. I just wish they lasted longer.  I would also like it if the game would play by it's own rules. In most levels, you have access to a dash ability. Sometimes, within the same section of levels, you lose that ability. You also get a jetpack that carries over into some levels, but not all of them. It becomes confusing and infuriating when you go to dash and then fall into an acid pit.  I also have to take points off for the lame final boss and horrendous cliff-hanger ending. I'm not certain that a sequel will be inevitable, but to end your first title on what basically is a 'To Be Continued' screen is just mean.  Still, for $5, you could do worse. Honestly, I'd just check out some of the other retro style platformers on Steam. This one doesn't do much that would differentiate it from the pack.  6/10",

            "review_text": "Recommendation: Yes, but this game needs some more improvements though.  Pros:  - Nails the 16-bit era graphics and feel right proper.  - Good and solid platforming! (Maybe a little too much platforming in some parts)  - Well done spritework and music.  Cons:  - Unable to rebind the movement keys. I feel incredibly awkward playing this game without being able to rebind the movement keys from the arrows to a WASD format.  - Controls somewhat clunky. A prime and infuriating example is how the dash is to double tap. Works in theory, but attempting to stay onto a box as it moves without accidentally dashing off of it and landing into the water is a frustrating endeavor. A better way of going about this is to have a button that one can press to dash in the direction the robot is facing, or holding down a button and moving either way to dash.  - Some minor graphical errors here and there, such as the tops of trees inexplicably hovering above parts of buildings (Not game-breaking, just strange), and some platforming issues with the box jumping area within Valiant Forest (The part where you have to jump from moving box to box along the water), as some of the boxes are spread out a little too far to actually make the jump.  Conclusion: Get the game, it's a nice little indie title and worth the cash, just don't expect it to be perfect. Voting up as this game has alot of promise to it! Keep up the good work guys, looking forward to seeing where this little gem goes in terms of updates!",
