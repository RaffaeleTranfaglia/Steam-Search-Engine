            "review_text": "For me, Hacker Evolution turned out to be a rather frustrating experience. There is a trace meter that tracks your trace level and when it gets to 100, you lose. The biggest problem is that you get penalized for successful cracks and decryptions which means the trace level increases even when you are doing things the right way. And the only way to decrease your trace level is through money, but they are pretty stingy on making that readily available. Not to mention they dangle a bunch of system upgrades that aren't cheap which gives a false impression that there is a lot of cash to be obtained in the game. So if you spend money on these upgrades, you end up with no money left to decrease your trace level and ultimately get stuck because you can't reduce your trace level. The manual even states, 'Important: Don't rush to upgrade your hardware as soon as you have money. Having the best hardware is not the main objective of the game. Carefully make your decision, and only upgrade your hardware when necessary. Money is not abundant in the game, and its main purpose is to reduce your trace time.' That key piece of information is not found anywhere in the game; you have to read it from the manual. Now why they decided to design a game that revolves around money, yet not make it abundant is not clear to me.  They don't even grant you rewards for completing missions (a little money would be nice). Instead they give you a score (why?). But the real kicker is your trace level carries over from the previous mission, so if it was high and you don't have any money, you're ♥♥♥♥ed on the next mission. What this ultimately means is you must follow a very specific path on the early missions to be able to survive the later missions. So after I figured this out, the game quickly lost any open world feel of being able to solve missions in different ways. Plus you never really know if you didn't do something right until you are stuck on a later mission with no money.  I did like the graphical interface, although the actual command execution was a bit oversimplified. It was fun for a few hours, but ultimately it was the lack of a proper reward system that really turned me away from progressing further with this game. If the simulated world of Hacker Evolution sounds interesting to you, go buy Uplink. It offers a much better gaming experience.",

            "review_text": "There are a lot of negative reviews about this game which I think is unfair. It's a misunderstood game, I wouldn't call it puzzle because that's misleading, but it is supposed to be a hacker simulator and nothing more than that.  My idea of a hacker simulator (before I decided to play any, that is) is something which can be periodically frustrating as you figure out (for yourself!) what to do next. It should require thinking skills, not just point and click with a hand-holding guide. A clear set of objectives and a list of commands so you know what to type and when, and when you finally do input the right code after trying time and time again, there should be a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.  Hacker Evolution does not let me down on my expectations of a hacker simulator, it is exactly what ti should be. It is unforgiving if you don't do things perfectly, but because the levels themselves would actually be quite SMALL if it weren't for all the try/fail/try/fail/try/succeed that goes into it, it is supposed to be difficult! So that you're not just breezing through it, because that would be completely unrealistic. I'm not saying that it is so amazing that it is like a hacker's version of say... Microsoft Flight Simulator where all the controls that would be in an actual aircraft are available to you. Because that would mean you would have to actually learn a programming language in order to play the game. It can't be 100% realistic because no one would play it, because the only people who could actually play it would be out hacking/ cracking real computers.   In saying that, it is an exciting game with a very simple, user friendly interface. The tutorial gives you enough information to learn the mere basics, it's not there to hold your hand and coddle you when you get frustrated and tell you that it loves you like in a lot of games. As far as I can see so far there's no ability to save your progress, you just have to start the level over from scratch, which isn't that big of a deal because you can generally remember what you need to do, and when you do things right in this game, it doesn't take very long to complete the levels.   Overall I'm very glad I didn't listen to a lot of these reviews which almost made me not buy the game (which is currently $2.99 on bundlestars for the ENTIRE Hackers Evolution games!). My actual point is, if you can't be bothered thinking for yourself, or feel you will have to resort to walkthroughs, then avoid this game like the plague because you won't find it very fun, because the AIM and the FUN of the game is to actually think for yourself!  8.5/10 - Gameplay; fun, simple to use once you get the jist of it. Helpful tutorial, but not too helpful so that it makes the game too easy.  7/10 - Music; the techno music is a bit of a stereotype, but it works well in the game and intensifies at just the right points which adds some nice suspense. 7/10 - Graphics; this game isn't about graphics, but they look fancier than what I imagine real hackers/ crackers work with. Kind of like a CTU interface from 24. 7.5/10 - Overall rating.",

            "review_text": "I received a copy of Hacker evolution as a gift from a friend and the game seemed like fun to me so i decided to give it a shot. First off I'd like to start on the negative points of the game. What really annoyed me is that you take your progress along every level, the amount of money you have and your 'global trace%'. So basically because I did something stupid in the second level of the game i had to completely restart the game in the late stage because I simply lacked the recources needed because of an earlier failure. Also I have an IT (wireless) networking background and you can tell the makers of the game did some homework, but not all of it if you have an IT background like me some little strange things can annoy you. I also understand people lacking an IT background may find this game very difficult.  In the end I did enjoy the game though there are definitely more than enough positive points to cover up the negative ones. The interface itself is really simple you may say it makes the game lack a nice graphical view, but that's not what it's made for. The interface is really overviewable and helps you especially in the early stages to pick up the game as soon as possible. I like the idea of the game, it's not really a hacking simulator offcourse it reminded me more of (very) basic scripting, but as a puzzle game it's well thought out and designed. The game offers for me a right amount of content. This isn't a game that should be 200 hours long as it would only be frustrating if you don't do any screwups like me expect somewhere between 8 - 12 hours of gameplay, depending on how quickly you pick the game up. The (included) expansion pack offers another hour of gameplay. I also like the puzzles themselves, the solution isn't often easily given, but unlike some other puzzle games I didn't run into random puzzle where you're more based on guesswork than logical thinking. Sometimes it can be a bit rough to find the answer to your question, but all puzzles have a logical and explainable solution.  So the game definitely has it flaws, but for me the positive points outweigh the negative points. It's not the best game ever made, but I enjoyed the experience of it in the end. If you enjoy this kind of genre and don't give up easily this would definitely nice for you to pick up. I'd rate it 7/10 in the end.",
