            "review_text": "Whatever the reason, be it the sense of the unknown, the dulling of the sense we tend to rely on most, or some other more inherent instinct, at some point we've probably all shared a fear of the dark and what might be lurking in it. My solution to this was pulling the covers over my head and sleeping with the lights on, but I suppose I didn't have a surreal world living in my closet like Pajama Sam so I couldn't very well head out and attempt to capture darkness in my lunchbox.  Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside is the blanket garbed, flashlight wielding protagonist's debut and one of the few Humongous games I never got a chance to play as a kid. And that's a bit of a shame as it might possibly be the best written, most logical and entertaining series the studio put out in their edutainment boom.  Characters are lively and over the top, with clever writing and a lighthearted sense of humor that makes them delightful to interact with. The twisting art is somewhere between a haunted house and an Escher painting and still looks fantastic even with the original low resolution, clearly distinguishing between items you can pickup and packing a lot of charming little touches into almost every nook and cranny.  This certainly isn't the most challenging (or possessing any challenge whatsoever for that matter), but its simple puzzles are no less fun to solve and helping Sam and his friends overcome their feels is all kinds of heartwarming. Perhaps I'm simply biased toward all of Humongous's catalog, even those I never played, but whatever the case the hour or so I spent with NNtHWIDO (oof, that's some acronym) was a rather surprisingly entertaining bit of breezy adventure gaming, and I'm now eager to see what Sam's future endeavors have to offer.",

            "review_text": "Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside is a point and click adventure game for kids with a few educational aspects thrown in. The plot is based on a comic that the main character, Pajama Sam, reads. He is on a mission to venture into his closet and defeat darkness so he won't have to be afraid of the dark anymore. You mainly click around to go to different screens and explore. You can talk to other characters, pick up items, and click on various parts of the environments as well for reactions or clues. And key locations of items are changed between playthroughs, giving it a few different ways to play. There's a lot of voicework in the game, with many characters having multiple dialogues for continued clicks. There's also a good amound of music and lots of sound effects to help go along with the colorful, cartoon style. You'll need to use a bit of problem solving for getting items and figuring out where to use them. There are even a few minigames to try out. Plus, there's a side quest for the more adventurous players to try and collect 10 pairs of socks. The socks are hidden throughout the game so you'll have 20 to try and spot as you search the screens of the game. It's a nice little touch for some extra challenge. Oh, and some of the humor is actually pretty good.  However, there are problems with this game. While there are many things to click on in any given location, a majority of them are simply there as goofy asides. There are typically a variety of different reactions for each item, but all they do is distract you from the main game. They don't really add much atmosphere, instead generally being there to keep kids entertained. It makes sense, sure, but it's not really something I'd call good game design, regardless of the target audience. There are even a few parts that don't have any real point to them, depending on which random set of circumstances the game gives you on your playthrough. Sometimes areas will have things to interact with but no reason to do so. Not that the extra bits aren't nice for a little more world there, or possibly an area to house a sock or two, but they don't feel necessary enough to include without looking at it as padding just a little bit. There also doesn't seem to be much reason to get all the socks. Not that there NEEDS to be a reward, and possibly there is as I missed a few, but it seems like the game just ends and doesn't really give you much incentive to go get them other than just wanting to do it for yourself.   Overall, it's a surprisingly solid game. I just randomly won it in a giveaway and figured it was going to be some lame kids' game. It actually isn't too bad. It could do more, do some things better, and be more challenging... but I understand its for kids that would probably spend more time figuring it out as it is. I didn't grow up with this game. I'm not blinded by nostalgia. I just thought it was genuinely a nice little experience. My only gripe is that it costs 7 bucks. That's a bit steep for this game, unless you're actually getting it for a kid. If you're getting it to check it out and you're not a kid, especially considering it's on Steam, then you're better off waiting for a sale to get it for only a few bucks. I wouldn't say it's worth full price, but if you're curious, it IS worth checking out. Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside gets a 6 out of 10 for being an older game for kids that has held up over the years, even without the nostalgia.",

The graphics are very nice and being set entierly at night the colour pallete consists of many shades of blue and it looks wonderful. The voice acting is top notch and the story is simply charming, the writing and wackiness even managing to capture the imagination of older players. There was never a dull moment and even the puzzles had this 20 year old adult scratching their head every now and then. I can't think of a better budget purchase. This game really was a nice suprise, I bought it with a 'so bad its good' mentality, but it really is that good!",

The story is a sprawling epic about a small child overcoming his fears and becoming the hero he was always destined to be. The theme of destiny is forced throughout the 200 hour experience.  The characters are perfect and accurate examples of real life people that no game has ever achieved nearly as well as this one did.  The puzzles. Those puzzles have haunted me all my life as being some of the best to ever exist.   I will say to my grandson/daughter, 'You will never play a game that is nearly as good as Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside. Never ever.'  If you are a fan of puzzles, story, beautiful graphics, top-notch level design, or even just games in general.

There's a lot of great humor in here that's not only for kids but adults too. It's great for everyone.   Another thing is that if something seems scary, it probably isn't. I know that's sort of in kid terms but putting that into an adult perspective is useful. For example, an interview. We get all nervous and some people are downright terrified but once we're through it-- it's usually not that bad.   So if you're looking for some good, clean fun this is the game for you.
