            "review_text": "It’s all about that one moment. Everyone who’s ever played or watched a fighting game knows it. It’s the final round, both players have a slither of health left and the next move is pivotal; the difference between success and failure, win or lose. Whether it’s playing against a friend, competing in an online ranked match or watching one of the many tournament streams of the fighting game community, everyone knows that one moment. It’s the veritable height of tension, excitement, elation and anguish. Divekick is that one moment distilled into an entire game. Each round of every single fight captures the thrill of those final few seconds in a tightly-contested bout; the moment that entices newcomers to the genre and sends diehard fans into mass hysteria. And it’s all accomplished with only two buttons.  What started out as a simple concept featuring two near-mechanically identical characters and a staple move of 2D fighting games, has now evolved to feature a roster of thirteen that surprises with its hidden depth. It’s odd to say that a game with only two buttons has any intricacy, but therein lies Divekick’s beauty. With one button to jump and one to kick it’s easily accessible for newcomers to the genre. Rounds are a quick twenty seconds and each fight’s nine possible rounds will end after one single hit. It’s the fighting game condensed to its purest form, sans any barrier to entry and welcoming to those dumbfounded and put off by the commitment required to learn the inner workings of the genres best. It’s a test of reads and reactions, of tactically positioning yourself based on your character’s idiosyncrasies and those of your opponent.  You simply jump and divekick, launching through the air to knock your opponent down in their stride.The characters of Dive and Kick showcase this concept at its base level, adopting the roles of Ken and Ryu (even if they are parodies of Yun and Yang) in Divekick’s outlandish universe with the most easy-to-grasp attacks. Positioning is determined by how high you jump and the angle of your kick. Press the kick button when your feet are on the ground and you hop backwards; kick enough and your super meter fills, how you use it depends on your fighter selection. These are simple systems and mechanics that welcome the uninitiated, removing the need to mesmerise button combos. Anyone can pick up Divekick and immediately start having fun, and it’s certainly at its best when played with friends, either locally or online.  However, there is an ever present complexity underpinning this apparent simplicity. Venture away from Dive and Kick and you’ll encounter characters with variations on the simple divekick. The Baz, for example, doesn’t defeat his opponents with his kick but with a trail of lightning that follows it. He can also pause mid-air and alter the angle of his kick, making him very effective if you can adjust to the peculiar way he deals damage. Other characters, like Jefailey, change from round to round. With each win his head begins to grow as his ego inflates, allowing you to jump higher while subsequently increasing the likelihood of suffering a critical headshot that leaves you concussed in the next round, drastically reducing the height of your jumps and the speed of your kicks. Dr Shoals, on the other hand, can perform a trajectory altering kick during her initial attack.  Each of Divekick’s thirteen characters adopt their own unique move lists, terrifically setting them apart from one another. That philosophy continues as you begin to experiment with each fighter’s singular special moves. As you build up the super meter via kicking you can either exert it by using Kick Factor (a parody of Marvel vs Capcom 3’s X-Factor that speeds up your character for a limited time) or by using your special moves. Each character has a ground move and an air move that can be activated by pressing both buttons at once provided you have enough meter. These range from the ability to temporarily float in the air to avoid dangerous situations or to set-up divekicks of your own, to a shoryuken-style Upkick and a handy duck. Though each character shares the same two buttons it quickly becomes apparent how diverse they each are, drawing an improbable amount of depth out of its simple control scheme.  Of course, this welcome complexity does contradict the notion that Divekick is incredibly easy to pick-up-and-play for newcomers to the fighting genre. There’s certainly an amount of explanation required whenever someone new picks a different character and wants to learn their many quirks, but Divekick handily subsides this somewhat with a story mode for each fighter. The AI is a tad on the easy side but these fights offer up a way to learn each character’s move list whilst unearthing their back stories via a handful of short motion comics.   Once you begin to play competitively against other people Divekick’s appeal is at its most discernible. Whether you’re playing locally with friends for a laugh or displaying your high-level skills in a ranked match, Divekick’s mechanics and use of basic fighting game concepts translate well to any environment. Some may write it off because of its simplistic control scheme and visual style but they would be missing the point. It may have slightly deviated from its original design to welcome the uninitiated to the genre – the many, many knowing references reveal a game that’s meant for the fighting game community more than anyone else – but the added depth proves welcome, even if it requires a little more understanding. Divekick is still all about that one moment, there’s just a little more nuance along the way.",

Each character has different speed and angles of dives, along with two special moves that you can use to get a tactical advantage. The fights are incredibly fast! This is an instant-kill game, meaning that you win a round with only one hit. Sounds tough? It is! You need to constantly try to outsmart your opponent, baiting him and setting traps.  Divekick proves that fighting games don't need to be intimidating, nor sport hundreds of moves and combos. It's lighthearted with lots of gaming and pop culture references and fighting game in-jokes. It might not look like a work of art, but it doesn't need to, as long as it provides some good laughs and easy-to-learn-hard-to-master mechanics. Which is exactly what it does great and why I wholeheartedly recommend it!",

The entire game is a parody of every fighting game out there and it just works. Somehow a two button fighting game is amusing and takes control, strategy, and timing. However because the game only uses two buttons, controlling your specials gets very buggy and confusing and the gameplay itself gets rather repetitive. Though there is a large roster of characters with different specials and different storylines there just isn't much the developers can do to make the game any different between characters when they are limited to two buttons. Not to mention the very slow loading screen between very quick points. Overall the gameplay is fun and local play can get very intense and I visit this game again every so often but the lack of creativity and difference in gameplay makes me feel like it's all been done. 7.5/10",

Trying this game out on a whim, I was won over almost instantly. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard playing a fighting game as I have playing Divekick. Its simplistic input design masks a plethora of fun. Everything from funny and interesting references of fighting games and the FGC to the realization of how silly it is to be so salty over the fact that you got beat by Jefailey even though you were playing the Baz. So I'll reiterate - if you like fighting games, or even if you think you might like fighting games, pick this game up.

Sure I really liked stuff like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and the like... But Divekick is the first time I ever felt like I could compete legitimately.   The Lang Zone is in full effect here with a brilliantly minimalist design. All characters have a million health and every attack does four million damage. There are two buttons. You jump, and then you kick. The brilliance of this design is that it is so simple yet there is depth in the way each character jumps, how each one kicks, and how their supers behave. Even the super moves are brilliantly simple, being activated simply by hitting both buttons at once and changing depending on whether you are on the ground or in the air.  I watched this game developed from the ground up thanks to the beautiful romance between Dave Lang and the GB crew and I'm so happy I saw it all the way through. I might not play it nearly as much as I should but if you want a fun, fast, popcorn-like fighting game nothing does it better than Divekick.  Get bopped, son.",

With a wide host of characters each with their own campagn. One can easily find hours of enjoyment out of mastering each one before inviting friends to crush or before trying out the ranked online. However divekick still has its flaws there is no way to back out of character select screens at all unless you join a game. Another error is two people may divekick each at the same time and be hit with a double ko or only one will be. This happens whenever it feels like and often make it confusing to guess one someone is going to be ko. all in all Divekick is a good game with flaws but nothing gamebreaking or unplayable.

Despite its simplicity and questionable character balance, Divekick would be a great game to pick up and play in short bursts, like a snack... but there's simply no action going on to participate in.",

Unless you were on the development team for this game you won't get 99% of the 'jokes'. Like what the hell is with [REDACTED]? What about Kenny? The only theory I have for Kenny is that he's a member of the dev team that died during development. The art is cartoony, but being cartoony isn't a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card. The lines are rough, the designs are somewhere between Eastern and Western and this just messes you up. The dialouge is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous and again, the jokes fall so flat you'd expect James Cameron to come down in a submarine and look at them.",

Even my grandmother knows what Divekick is, and if you're reading this, you've already seen a couple screens of it and probably skimmed a couple other reviews.  I organize my steam library by genre, and when I went to sort this one, it gave me pause. Sure, it's kind of a fighting game, but it's also a bit of a strategy. Mostly, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   The worlds first two-button fighter (and it means that literally. No analog stick movement at all. Dive. Kick.) comes to us from Iron Galaxy games, and maybe it should have stayed there. Previously a developer for Dungeons and Dragons digital titles, they moved to a heavily meme-inflated 'fighting' game where you first dive (or 'jump', but whatever) by pressing one button, and then, while in the air, kick using the other. That's it. There's a cast of characters to choose from, most of them harkening back to inside jokes.   It's moderately funny, I guess, but that's hardly a reason to spend 10 bucks. Basically if you have Divekick, it's because you got hyped on it (or in my case, someone gifted it) and spent maybe as long as I have playing it. Poor replay value outside of sheer novelty, poor gameplay attibuting victories to luck rather than any variant of skill, and after the third or fourth time he holds up the, 'I don't hug white girls.' sign, the joke loses its luster, and I quit out to go play a fighting game with more than two buttons.   Should you get it? Do you make enough money to literally waste ten dollars? Sure, but if you're even a tiny bit iffy about it, wait until the next time it's 90% off. In the meantime, there are better ten dollar games.  Hell, there are better FIVE dollar games. Get two.",
