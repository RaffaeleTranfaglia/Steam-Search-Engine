            "review_text": "1h42 minutes. That's how long it took me to finish that game 100%, get all the achievements, and looking into every nook and cranny to get all the dialogs. This is not a RPG, at all. This is an adventure game, a story, where you make decisions. Those decisions are pretty much limited to 4 binary choices, kill or don't kill. They don't change much of anything, just a comment in the epilogue.  The only thing here is the story and deciding the fate of the characters. There's pretty much no story, just looking at a slice of life of 4 elderly people at the end of their rope (and it's possibly all a dream anyway). The characters are uninteresting, shallow, and often unoriginal. There's a lot of pee and poop 'jokes' (not sure if they're supposed to be jokes), and nearly everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I couldn't care less about the characters, and the only thing here is to decide what happens to them (which might not actually do anything anyway). That makes it really pointless.  And short. Which is probably a good thing, now that I think about it. Since it felt like a waste of time, it's better that way. It's not horrible, but it wasn't enjoyable or interesting or memorable to me.  Now I'm going to let it run a few hours to drop the cards and uninstal it forever. I supposed it's a cheap way to get trading card even if the game itself isn't all that good.",

Take a look and enjoy hopefully but dont deserve to much, if you like stories games fine if not there are enough other games at steam. Thank you for reading.",

Pros ~ +For 19 cents this game is definitely worth it,   HOWEVER,   this game is not really worth the base price of $4.99 in my opinion +Free roam for the most part; lots to discover +The graphics was more than expected +Storyline was well thought out and executed +Simple and easy controls for ease of gameplay +Music and sound is on point +Achievements and cards  Cons ~ - Relatively short - Storyline can be very dark at times depending on yourself and your decisions - Depending on how you look at it: Focus was not on the 'main' character's characterisation, more on the 4 old people you play through as  If you like games where you can browse at your leisure and choices that shape your destiny, this is a game for you. This game however, is very short. My first playthrough only took about 1 and a half hours. To get all the achievements merely took me around 4 hours of leisure game time.",

            "review_text": "Having completed one playthrough of this game, I found it to be charming and fairly thought-provoking. It starts out fairly average, leaving the player to feel as if they are simply going about their character's normal life... which they are. Little will you know until later on how ironic the character's comment, 'I am taking control of my life' is, in consideration of what happens next.  It doesn't take long to finish the game, but the different outcomes you can get for different, vital choices in the game encourage more than one playthrough, at least if you're curious how fate can happen differently. Overall it's pretty straightfoward though, and you get to experience life through the eyes of different people and become responsible for their fate... literally.  My favorite thing about the game is that the antagonist isn't painted in black and white; she isn't necessarily evil, even if she denies responsibility for any of the tragedies that happened (even if she is a direct influence and she is responsible for placing you in a position where you can make potentially bad choices). However, it could be argued that she is simply trying to enhance your knowledge and your perception on life... even if her reasons for doing this are unclear.  Either way, it's definitely worth a playthrough or two. Especially if you're in a mildly sadistic mood.",

Simple controls  Not too glitchy Easy achevments Can use for card farming.  Cons: Completley story based, expected a combat based system. Though I enjoyed this, others may not. Game was entirely too short, the 5$ price tag can't be deemed worthy of the content, buy it when it goes on sale.  Had a few glitches, one of them game breaking.  Not enough side quests. Not enough main quests. Music could get annoying if you take too long in one area.  Do I advise you buy this game? Yes, I do. But I suggest you buy it on sale.  ",

There was a tiny bit of 'thought-provoking' storyline that was slightly interesting, and it was a cool concept to execute. However, the execution wasn't great, and the game wasn't all that enjoyable. All in all, Greyfox is a game that you probably shouldn't buy unless you get it for super cheap like I did (I paid around 50 cents because of a Steam coupon).",

There's an excess of object descriptions (less useless descriptions would have been better), so it can get confusing at first if you go around checking everything.  It's ok.",

I don't like seeing many of the harsh reviews people have because of poor writing or the way some people use their RPG Maker games as a sort of 'fan-fiction,' ripping off ideas from other media instead of being completely creative and fresh. That being said, I noticed that I could buy the one game for 49 cents on sale, or buy 4 games in this bundle for the same price. Honestly, who could complain about such a cheap game? So I bought it and the same day played the smallest game on the list, Greyfox RPG. First off, I couldn't call this a JRPG for anything, and I could barely call it an RPG in the sense I am familiar with RPGs. (Although, in the sense of you playing the role of a person, this IS an RPG.) It is just like the description says. You move to a town called Greyfox where you meet a mysterious woman and you get to live the lives of 4 old people in the town. You decide what happens at the end of their lives, and can possibly solve a mystery or two along the way. I have only played through once so far, getting the 'bad' ending, but I liked its premise. I played a Psychological-Horror type game with RPG Maker when I was a lot younger, and appreciated the use of the program for story-telling, rather than a traditional 'kill enemies and level-up' RPG game. There are a few little secrets to find, a little bit of humor, and many 'What exactly is going on here?' moments that make you feel like you're in the main character's shoes. So far, I can't say I would spend the full $1.99 on it, but if you ever come across another sale where the game is 49 cents or is in a bundle with other games dropping the price down to around 12 cents, pick it up. It's a fun little gem, perfect for playing on a night where you wake up at 2am and can't get back to sleep, or any time you have an hour to kill.",

However, if you are looking for a game with a good or deep story/plot, loveable characters or that plays with your emotions, this one is not for you.  Ironically, I also found some game glitches and mistakes which I will list below in the order I found them while playing. Please be aware of some as they might  'BREAK'  your game and force you to reload a saved file! I will add more when I find them as I didn't finish the game yet.  - Guy walking with dog in dog park always walks through you and is later stuck in the upper left corner, so you can never talk to him. - The playing cards on the table during Mr. Browns dream change into a meal set when you click on them from below.   - If you want to give the dog cookie to the lonely dog in the dog park, you have to do that from the left side. Otherwise the GAME WILL BE STUCK and you have to RELOAD a saved game!!!   - Even though you give your cats to the pirate and he takes off, he turns invisible (your path is blocked where he was standing.) and you can still talk to him.   This means you can send him off again which COSTS you again!   I accidentally did that and reloaded an earlier saved game as I don't know if you need the money later on or not or if you can even keep the money throughout different dreams because I didn't play it any further yet.",

It says that the style was inspired by the likes of Chrono Trigger but it has absolutely nothing to do with it - making a game with tiles in RPG Maker doesn't mean sharing anything with Chrono Trigger's style. It's unfortunate, because the idea behind the game isn't bad, but it definitely needed some extra months of developments to be acceptable, let alone for 5$.",

I however wouldn't recommend that you buy this game at full price, as 4.99€ seem a bit extreme.  The game is a typical 2D RPG game, with very simple controls and the graphics are what you can expect from this kind of game. The game has a short storyline attached to it, which will take you about 1 hour to complete, if you dont rush your way through the game that is. I liked the game for what it is, and I would say the storyline was a bit different from other games I have played.  Oh and the game has different endings, depending on how you choose to play out the game ;)   For achievement hunters. It's a relatively easy game to get 100% in, as it took me about 2½ hours to do. It can however be done alot faster, because I didn't even start looking at the achievements untill I was done with my first playthrough, and I guess if you abuse the save options a bit, and plan ahead, it won't really take you long.",

Hopefully this little game does well. I'd definitely be interested in another one in the future that had it's own custom design work.   Still, the story, dialogue, and general vibe were interesting enough for me to keep playing for a bit. On sale, I'd definitely say it's worth the price of admission.",

You play as a character that gets to see different perspectives in a town resident's life and choose what happens in that storyline. If you like minor philosophical plots and don't mind a short pixel game of the RPG Maker variety, then buy it (I purchased it on sale). The acheivements are fairly easy to get, too.  One note that may help any forms of cynicism on the story: the Mysterious Lady can say some things about life that you disagree with, but think of her as just a character with an opinion and not the opinion of the creator (because who knows if it is or just a perspective considered). There's some humor here and there, too.",

If a person is spiteful, has a dull life, or did something horrible, does that person deserve death? Do we have the rights to judge and execute them? How about the guilt of killing a human regardless of his/her crime/life/way of treating people?, etc. Each person will have their own answers for these questions, and the endings are just the developer(s)'s point of view, so you may agree or disagree.
