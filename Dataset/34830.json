            "review_text": "Lets make first things first: This game isn't so bad at all, if you have no expectations. If you really want a good sniper game, go one with Sniper Elite V2 and the following ones.  However, if you play through the levels it feels like this game can't decide what it wants to be. A stealthy sniper game - like you would expect from the name? A common military FPS shooter? In the end, nothing of this feels right as it should.  In the stealth missions it's hard to stay undetected. Even if you really try - the so-called KI spots you 10km far away, they raise the alarm immediately and you don't have a chance to turn it off. You shoot with a silenced weapon? Everyone else in a distance about 20m seems to be aware of that shot.  Nevertheless, in the levels you play the opposite side you just try to go in like Rambo. The recoil of the assault rifle is rediculous. I couldn't get a clear shot with it and mostly died because my character seems to be the only target for the enemy while two of your KI-friends stands around and shoot everything that moves. That makes it nearly impossible to play it on hard (for the achievements).  I don't mind neither the linearity of this game nor the invisible walls. But the controlls and the gameplay itselfs are so bad that I didn't mind to play forward anymore.  You can get it very cheap out of a bundle? Feel free to buy it, but don't pay the whole price for it. It's not worth it.  Personal rating:  -5.0/10.0-",

            "review_text": "The maps are linear and cramped (in a sniper game? really? yes, yes really). The sniping events are scripted up to the eyeballs until all fun is drained from them. Sniping itself is barebones-simple. Hiding and camouflaging (like a sniper is SUPPOSED to do?) is often downright impossible. Much of the time you'll just be soaking up enemy fire while you snipe no matter what you do. The regular soldier shooty sections in between sniper missions are horribly clunky and boring.  TL;DR This piece of sh!t doesn't deserve to be called 'Sniper' or any variation thereof.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game, but no matter how hard I tried, in the end? I just couldn't.  The game is a ton of fun and has variety to spice things up. Through most of the campaign you play as 'Tyler' The sniper. You stealth through villages, slaughter hundreds of people via pistol or sniper rifle, and just be a general badass. However what I didn't see coming was that there are also several segments of the game where it turns into Call of Duty and you're taking oil rigs with an assault rifle as 'Conway' a member of 'Delta'. It was an..interesting surprise but the mechanics in the game REALLY don't suit assault rifle gameplay.  It runs decently on modern systems. Some graphical glitches unfortunately, ESPECIALLY if you're running multi-gpu. NOTE: Do not run this game with multi-GPU.  The stealth system is basic. The graphics are...decent. Textures are horrible but character models and object models have their high-points. The sniping 'circle' that indicates where your shot will land breaks occasionally, ESPECIALLY when you zoom further in with your scope. The main campaign is very short, about 5 hours. The DLC Campaign 'Unfinished Business' will add about 3 hours to the game give or take (But is immensely frustruating due to an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoint system).  The story is very uninteresting. I've finished both campaigns and I just remember bits and pieces of everything. I couldn't tell you who Tyler was employed with, why we were fighting who we were fighting or anything. I LOVE stories too, I buy games mostly for the stories! But this one is just pathetic.  The characters are meh as well. Tyler is a regular individual, Conway is....a guy with a name...and O'Neil just has a voice actor that makes me want to remember him, but he was so underdeveloped I'll forget him in two days tops.  The multiplayer is horrendous. Extreme server latency issues. Consistent fluctuating ping regardless of your internet connection. And all for what? A Call of Duty with nothing but snipers and silenced pistols? No thank you. (As well as broken server finding that stops you from hosting any server using any DLC weapons/maps due to the developer forgetting to include that information in the server list)  All in all this game is not worth your time. There are MUCH better games out there, but if you have this one, no harm in giving it a try. It is drudgerous however, and your effort never pays off as the ending is likely the WORST part of this game. All 3 of them. (Yes, there are 3. The main campaign ending, the DLC ending, and then finding out you're not done and there's a 'Challenge' mode that's 1 mission to end the entire game- which I never played because after 8 hours I grew SO sick of the game.)  FInal Verdict is a 4/10. Sub-par, but not completely worthless.",

The game feels bad, just bad. The AI works in some wierd ways (Can't see you when you are 2 meters infront of them but will eagle eye you cross map). The movement is also really awkward, it feels like you are Jimmy from South park, you can't even walk up stairs without needing to jump. The sniping however is good, hiding in the bushes and picking off targets feels nice and rewarding. I would recommend this game if it weren't for one thing. Soldier play. Somehow the guys that made this thought it was a good idea to have levels where you play as a soldier with an assault rifle, it plays like ♥♥♥♥. You know those days in middleschool when your best friend was sick? The day wasn't hard or painfull, but just really really boring, right? It's like that, you just want it over.   The only reason i can recommend it is if you really want to play some sniper games, but if you are looking for entertainment you have come to the wrong place. Plus the game only last 4 (painfully long) hours.  I rate this 5 bacon strips out of 10  NOTE: The Second strike DLC is actually kind of good.",

I'm a little disappointed I paid for it, and I will be uninstalling it now that it's over.  And speaking of over, the ending was the worst kind of anti-climactic ending I've ever seen. Boss gets killed with a SINGLE shot to the head. From a roof. A hundred yards away. No one shot back. Screen fades to black. 'The End' in white text. Then credits roll.

To compensate, they have eagle sight and pinpoint accuracy. They see your muzzle flash if you shoot their friend from 200 metres while they show their backs. Or, they don't realize their friend is actually dead and keep talking to him. Flip the coin. - For some reason, the game has standard FPS sections, which are purely horrible. No more words wasted here. - Unrealistic situations. Example: your friends keep screaming for sniper support when they are hardly outnumbered and have safe cover.

The sniping action was extremely satisfying - getting a headshot from 150m away and seeing the slowmo kill cam was truly gratifying and made me want to yell out 'HEADSHOT' ala Unreal Tournament lol! I think I may have done that a few times :p  One aspect that i didn't like though was that you did not always play a sniper. Most of the time you were Razor 6-4, the sniper and that was great but sometimes you'd switch to playing the ground team Delta-3 who are using close quarters assault rifles and this is a very different style of gameplay which can be quite annoying. There were only 2 of these that I remember though and the rest of the game makes up for it.  I bought this game in a bundle for around $1 but it is definitely worth more. Loved it.

            "review_text": "The Short n' Sweet: I went into this expecting trash with some snipe-y shoot-y fun. I got mostly that. If you go into it with the same mindset you'll probably have some fun. (I played on Hard - it was a bit of a struggle at times.) The icing on this mediocre cake is when, I kid you not, the final objective is punctuated with a black screen with the text 'The End' which made me laugh both times it happened (both the vanilla campaign and the DLC mission which was actually a lot better). Cue upside-down credits (not even joking).  Details, the Good: -The sniping mechanics are simple, sweet, rewarding. You get that cheesy bullet cam thing that a fair number of games have used, nothing new or special here. It's no Sniper V2 which was roughly same generation IIRC, with X-Ray damage report, but it's satisfying when you just made a ridiculous shot and watching it nail the guy between the eyes. -It's fairly pretty at a low graphical load. I kept wishing for a custom shader mod, and it may exist. LOTS of detail was put into the environments and it paid off. -On Hard it will give you a run for your money. It's one of those games where you are thankful that the quicksave button is there, on, and saving/loading is a matter of seconds at most. -Voice acting okay. I wish I didn't have to say this but a lot of these off-brand military games have horrible voice acting so it was nice to see it wasn't as bad as I went in expecting.  The Bad: -You will not get a Crysis-like experience out of your sniping, utilizing these vast beautiful landscapes to their fullest. It's fairly linear. Honestly, it didn't bother me, but I know there are people who will consider this much worse than I did so it's worth a mention. -The story is almost accurately non-existent. You don't have a lot of drama going on, much like a real Op would be. Again, may not be a problem for you. -Bugggggggy. I died at least once for falling onto something and dying for no apparent reason. The quickload happening within seconds made me not care too much with how often I found myself saving. Also, and this IS a problem, stairs are extremely tricky and complicated feats of engineering for our poor protagonists. You find yourself doing a little dance to get up basic stairs sometimes. Some other minor bugs I didn't really care about scattered throughout. It just felt low budget (probably was, again didn't bother me.) -Worst of all is the mandatory infantry scenes. Playing this on Hard was a niiiightmare. The game was clearly not built for the kind of Call-of-Duty-esque sections they forced upon you in the vanilla game. The DLC mission thankfully left this out. The only saving grace is that you can regenerate health up to 30/100 in cover. So you just need to hit your head against it a few times to get through.  The funny (and arguably most important piece of this review): -When you load the game, if you have the same glitch happen as I did, all the starting video and splash screen will be upside down. You will see a parallel universe where the sniping is happening upside down and nobody seems to mind. This happens again, as stated before, when you reach the credits which are also upside down. If you are the kind of person who can see that when starting up a game for the first time and say 'That's hilarious, I don't care, I just want to go sneaky beaky and snipe some dudes' then this is a game you will get a kick out of. If you need your games to all be polished high budget perfection, don't even get this on sale or you might implode.",

I played this game few years after release and it seems that developer didn't fix anything after cash grab and they moved on to making the second and third part of this game.  + decent gfx considering the Chrome engine (do not confuse with Chrome web browser) rare satisfying moments of action sniping like on good B action movie, silencer on rifle and quite *psst* *psst* in the jungle story told from perspective of few members of delta but.... see below  - quasi jungle maps with narrow corridors, invisible walls everywhere linear as ♥♥♥♥ mission driven by some horrible scripts - your AI squad can get stuck at the beginning of the level stupid AI with wallhacks, aimbots and stare that could burn your soul animation after killing a soldier is laughable, some poor ragdolls with sticks in ♥♥♥ and joints slowmo camera after headshot is boring and pointless comparing to Sniper Elite V2 after death enemy will drop full package of ammunition (WTF lazy dev) no presentation of sniper rifles in sniping game, no explanation how to use the mil dots in the scope and how each scope is calibrated - same fail as in Sniper Elite V2 inconsistency during the mission (blowing up tree AA positions, no on gives a ♥♥♥♥) inconsistency between missions (magic change of main sniper rifle, full ammo) illogical story - this game should be called SNIPER: FAIL WARRIOR when you realised that entire team is making crucial mistakes during the mission - lame plot device did I mention the stupid AI? enemy will hit you with every bullet, during relocation between cover, under heavy suppression - Anarki in Q3 Arena on nightmare is jealous of their acc sniping is not challenging, 95% of the time you do not need to compensate for wind or gravity, just place the cross on the head and pull the trigger - Sniper Elite V2 did a better job there - at least the action sniping is some fun parts of the game where you go loud with few other deltas is simply the worst experience ever! - 1. instead of equipping with silencers and collimators we're getting basic M4 2. the M4 have some terrible rng vertical recoil and you can't see ♥♥♥♥ trough the iron sight, throw to it the aimbot AI and the fact that they can pretty well merge with the background = you will have a bad day in the end the story was generic, evil general bla bla, cocaine bla bla, plans for nuclear weapon bla bla and the last mission? Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. The developer was so lazy that after final assassination they just black out the screen in order to show you some credits, no extraction, no drama, no dinozaurs :/  This game didn't passed any QA, the amount of BS and broken elements is shocking!!!

The muzzle jump on these weapons aren't anything close to real world. No military would buy a weapon that had such a horrible flaw. I'm on easy mode and can't make it through An Alliance to Save Rodriguez, even with breathing enabled. Also, even though there are three on your team, TWO STAND BACK AND WAIT FOR YOU TO CLEAR THE ENTIRE AREA. However, if I had my sniper rifle, I could easily do my job, as a sniper, that's why it's called Sniper: Ghost Warrior. You never know what weapons are issued to you until you start the current objective. The first time this happened, I thought I did something wrong, that I'd accidentally tossed my sniper rifle aside, and I retraced my steps. We should always have the exact same compliment of weapons through the entire game. One final thing, and one that's my pet peeve with many other games: not knowing if the weapon you're switching out for is better or worse. I switched out one sniper rifle because I thought it was an upgrade. But it wasn't, it wasn't equipped with a silencer and I had to start the chapter over.",

You can't run very long unless you want your character to pretty much start having an asthma attack, same goes when you're trying to snipe, your character is breathing too hard and sometime you have to use the 'hold your breath' function to make a good shoot, I know this is supposed to give a realistic spin to the game play but it gets annoying after a while. The game does give you a chance to see special cutscenes when you make a clean headshot, but only for certain NPCs, not everytime you actually make the shot.  Speaking of the NPCs, their conversations are always the same, always, there's never chance, and they sound weird because they were recorded by actors that are evidently spanish instead of latinamerican, which wouldn't be such a big deal if the game wasn't set in Latinamerican and the actor weren't so bad at changing their accent.  But for all the complains I have, this game is kinda addictive, if only for the need of actually wanting to complete it more than anything else (there's no real story to follow), it helps that is relatively short, so if you have nothing better to play and you want to kill a couple of hours, you can try it.",
