            "review_text": "Greatest strategy ever, amazing plot, sweet graphic. I have spent hour playing that game. The races are unique, every race has their own special units, that make your gamepley different everytime you play another race. The campaign is awesome. I have heard that there is problem running that game on Windows 7, though I have managed to start it. Please try this:  1. In the Steam game library, right click the game 2. Select 'Properties' 3. Select the 'Local Files' tab 4. Click 'Verify integrity of game cache'  This has been known to easily fix the 'Failed to find steam' error. If the issue persists then it is recommended you try these steps:  1. Open the Start Menu, right click 'Computer', and select 'Properties'. 2. From the column on the left of the new panel, select 'Advanced System Settings'. 3. From the new dialogue, press 'Environment Variables...' (at the bottom of the 'Advanced' panel, just above 'OK', 'Cancel', and 'Apply'). 4. In the top half of the newly opened dialogue (User variables) if there is: a - no existing entry for PATH, use 'New...' to add it (Variable Name: PATH, Variable Value: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam -- i.e. wherever you have Steam installed). b - already an entry for PATH, use 'Edit...' to add ;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam (or wherever your Steam is installed) at the end of the existing value. (Note the semi-colon to separate the value that was already there from the new bit with the Steam path.) 5. Press 'OK' 6. Log off and log on again. You should now be able to run the Steam titles without problems. If you have further issues I suggest you contact Steam Support as there may be issues with your Steam Client.  After that the game will start, but it can be really slow ( about 1 FPS), try than setting at highest possible graphic settings and check box called 'User Direct3D'. It starts on fullscrean, but it is slightly smaller than your whole monitor, so it should allow you to run it and enjoy that great game!",

            "review_text": "A dark gothic themed fantasy turn based strategy games with many factions. Plays rather simply with squad formations mixed in with map exploration. The combat system differs from other entries of the genre and might either hit strongly or miss depending on the audience. There is a degree of repetitiveness into carrying your squad through every mission but your leader will carry over from mission to mission and will attain godlike strenght. Very memorable units and very strong story. The overland map does not look very well but once you get used to it it has the decency to be effective in displaying what you need to know and the style is still appropriate to the setting. The combat and zoomed in sequences look very good still in my humble opinion.   This game will run well on any machine except for a slow mouse cursor bug that can be fixed. I will edit my review once I find up to date information regarding it.",

            "review_text": "Disciples II is a turn-based strategy/RPG. Players send parties of fantasy heroes around the overworld to kill monsters, get loot, and conquer enemy towns. As you play through the campaign, you can continue to level up one specific hero, and I found myself having this one hero single-handedly slaughtering armies. It's tough to level up other parties since there aren't many weak enemies. The game's a little slow-paced, but building up your party and winning with it is fun. It definitely has some depth. If you like it, it can keep you busy for a long time.  The tutorial was not good, but the game is ultimately not that tough to figure out.  The game's art is very well-done for being entirely 2D. The music works. The plot is boring, at least for the human campaign (haven't made it to the others yet). A warning: it doesn't play well with modern systems, but I got it to work eventually.  For strategy fans (maybe RPG fans too), I think the game's worth buying.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic HoMM-style turn-based strategy RPG built around Norse mythology marred by some poor game design choices. There's great variety between the races and each has their own campaign, with each faction having a distinct style. The combat is unique and feels like Ogre Battle but this is also one of it's biggest problems; similarly to Ogre Battle, if all of your units in a party die, they are gone forever. Your favorite hero and his units will transfer between missions so this means if one of your super-units dies you can potentially throw the campaign. The terrain control mechanic is a great visual representation of your area control but I find it downplayed in many missions because of a turn limit or boss rush. Hero customization is diverse and has more options than HoMM but they are slower to level up. Although it has aged poorly, this is a great HoMM alternative that is worth checking out if you're a fan of strategy games.",

After the main campaign I had my fill and didn't even play the included expansion.  You run through a series of levels only bringing your hero with you. The hero gains levels and you choose between different options to improve and keeping most of the items you find during the game, letting you customize your hero. There is the risk in the game that if you lose most of your leveled units your new unleveled units won't be able to defeat anything. This is a problem others have posted and having played the game I can see it happening to people.  After all that, if the game still looks interesting enough, give it a try. You might like it.",
