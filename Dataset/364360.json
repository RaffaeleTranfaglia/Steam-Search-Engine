            "review_text": "As a kid I used to paint and collect Warhammer. I would imagine my warriors battle hoardes of Orcs and Chaos as I played against my brother and my friends. Great heroes and huge, sprawling battles raged in my mind. My brother's Empire troops standing bravely against my vampire hoarde!  The only place I could actually see something akin to these battles was through the Total War franchise with Rome Total War which we also used to play together. Ambushing his Roman column with Gaulic warriors!  I have waited twelve years for this pairing to come along. Even since I heard the announcements I have been eagerly waiting. Despite all of that pressure, the game did not disappoint. The battles that I dreamed of seeing as a kid are coming to life before my eyes.   I now live in the USA and my brother is still in England. We are playing our cooperative campaign to recreate those same rivalries, stories and memories that we would make with our models on our kitchen table as kids. Technology like this makes life better. Three thousand miles apart and yet thanks to this platform we can feel that same joy and excitement that we did back then.  10/10 would make more childhood dreams come true",

            "review_text": "When I first heard about a fantasy universe in a Total War game I shook my head in disapproval.  I was stuck in the mindset that TW need its origins in real-world history and realism – boy was I wrong.  The squalor, food and aging is removed to give room for the fantasy to shine, and it delivers.  You no longer have to worry about your mighty captain(in this game lord) becoming a victim of aging or falling in a surprise battle. Your ”Legendary Lords” will always be there(if you can avoid a 5 turn assasination wound recovery) and you never feel your progress getting lost or wasted – it's honestly great.  It means that you can put your entire heart and soul into becoming the mightiest Lord, without worrying about inevitable death. Needless to say that this fits a fantasy universe perfectly.  As a new feature your Lord is now a single person instead of being part of a squad, which works wonders – you will no longer suffer from random unlucky deaths of your lord, by simply being unlucky with who dies in his squad. The single unit now works off of a pool of HP, which eliminates that element of luck that haunted killing a captain in previous TW games. As the game progresses and your lord earns levels through glorious combat, he will get some unique questlines to fulfill in order to gain high tier loot, such as powerful weapons and armor – really satisfying and worthwhile to complete. Usually with a fun battle(including cutscene) to end it.  Diplomacy is miles apart from all other TW games – way better, with AI that actually doesn't seem to be controlled by your dog and actively engages in diplomacy.   Those were som quick thoughts – 100% recommended as the best TW game so far.",

            "review_text": "I read The Hobbit as a Freshman in highschool in 1979. I started playing Advanced D&amp;D later that year, and Dungeon Mastered my first game on Dec. 31, 1979. We played well into the morning and everyone crashed in chairs and couches after the sun had come up. We didn't play any other than AD&amp;D until the mid to late 80's but when we did we tried them all. Paladium and all of their stuff from Rifts to Beyond the Supernatural, Shadown Run, Champions you name it. We picked up Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and ate it up. During that time we played a lot of Games Workshop stuff. Talisman, Hero's Quest, Battle Master, and of course Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Games Workshop always put out great stuff with awesome back stories that set the perfect atmosphere of each adventure. When computers rolled around in the 90's we saw the potential and would fantasize about the possibilities of going to these places virtually and see all the places we had played for so many years. We started in Ultima Online I stayed there way past their peak, then ended up in WOW for 7 years or so. Everyone wants to complain about the price of DLC's. I paid 15 a month for WOW for years and always thought it was worth the money. Now one of those games we used to play back in the day has come out. Total War Warhammer has captured those awesome backstories and set that perfect atmosphere that great games always do. The game is completely flexible to allow expansion and easily changed to make it what ever you think it should be. Add some units with a mod, or pay for a DLC if you want, but you don't have to. I absolutely love this game and I want it to be successful. I don't have any problem paying for DLC as long as they don't get too expensive. So far so good! I like what I see! They have made an old gamer happy! Hopefully I'll retire one day with the complete world at my fingertips and ride off into a magical sunset. Pretty scary thought. Anyway, I do recomend this game!",

            "review_text": "very rare i'll write a review, but by far the best total war game since Rome 1 imo, haven't personally came across any bugs, and apart from the launch issues (i'd only been trying for 5 minutes to get the game working before the hotfix came available) its been a flawless experience, a must have for any total war or warhammer fan!  edit:  So after 14 hours of gameplay i'll go a little bit more indepth to try and help people make up their minds on the game with all the mixed reviews that are kicking about.  To start off with, if you have a reasonably new pc you will have absolutely no issues at all running this game, my cpu is a FX-9370 and my gpu is a Sapphire R9 380 4gig, the campaign runs smooth at 1920x1080 with no stuttering whatsoever, the transition to battles from the campaign map is a lot faster than previous total war games (approx 30 seconds) and then the actual battles run fine on ultra settings as well (again running at 1920x1080).  The only time i had to turn the graphics down to High was when me and 3 friends decided to play vs 4 AI on the largest unit sizes and everyone having a 20 stack (80x80).  I've played both multiplayer battles and multiplayer co-op campaign and have yet to experience any desync issues myself either (which i know was a big issue on some of the previous games).  So far i've only had a quick play around with Chaos and Empire so can't really give any feedback on the Orcs, Dwarfs or Vampire Counts.  --Chaos-- -Nice selection of units and also having to decide which god you want to worship giving different bonuses and penalties. -Horde units (so you don't technically have to upkeep towns except the embedded buildings in the army) (changed faction after i lost my units for taking a stupid battle so i'll come back to chaos after more game time)  --Empire-- -Plenty of diversity within the faction roster so you can build your armies your own way! -Although the game suggests that they are the 2nd easiest to play as at the start things are a bit chaotic to begin with. Surrounded by orcs, dwarfs and rebellious empire factions that all want to wipe you out! -Easy to manage your towns when you get to grip with the new set up. -Hard difficulty is actually Hard, i've had to restart 4-5 times due to making silly errors and getting punished by surrounding factions.  Lastly Cons and Pros imo --Pros-- -Smart AI when playing on hard and above (haven't tried on Normal or Easy), if you declare war on an AI to your east, expect opportunist rival factions surrounding you to declare war on you and try to grab land whilst your armies are nowhere to be seen. -Graphics are amazing and the game is well optimized. -All factions are different and suit a different play style! (obviously). -Ease to join friends games (steam overlay actually works to invite and join friends).  --Cons-- -As empire when you unlock a new unit, e.g. you start off with 'spearmen' and unlock 'spearmen with shields', there isn't an option to upgrade the base unit to the upgraded like in previous total war games, you have to dismantle your army and re-recruit the ugraded units. Not sure if this is intentional or a bug? -Tutorial for non experience total war players can be a bit underwelming, doesn't really go in to a lot of detail when it comes to hero skills and town management. -Bretonnian units and bases are in the game but aren't a playable faction at the moment on the campaign map. (ye ok i'm a bretonnian fanboy).  If your new to Total War games start off by playing on Easy or Normal, if your experience with Total War games get the difficulty cranked up and have fun :) Hope this helps!",

I recommend it 100% in all my pro gaming honor. And super fun!!!!!!! Just turn off the antivirus completely when playing this game and it wont lag at all, but turn antivirs off completely and restart the pc if the antivirus needs this to be turned off but remember to turn it on when not playing, i did that and it doesnt lag on medium, it runs great. THIS IS TOTAL WARHAMMER - SPARTA - EPICNESS!!!!!!!!!!!! Also formation abilities are already in the game in passive form for example charge defence vs all etc and this is so well thought cause its no longer a pike wall spam fest for example, also units themselves have active abilities. Also this is IMPORTANT: after making a group for example ctrl+4, then u select that group so all units are selected and press ctrl+G, it saves the unit formation and enables group attack, which is like the a-move in rts, u select when u want the group and click it to attack an enemy unit and the units of the crtl+G group will target different enemy squads which are close to the target, of course the targets arent always the most optimal so u can select those units which dont have the best target and manually set target but this saves a lot of time and like that u dont have to press pause all the time to manually set targets fr each unit of your army. The multiplayer is GREAT - INTELLIGENT - STRATEGIC, plain and simple.",

            "review_text": "How do I describe it?   It's at the same level Shogun 2 was when it came out. A step up from its predecessors and a step behind what we had hoped for. This game needs to be good and needs to be well received I believe for the Total War franchise to continue on.   PROCONNERUS!   I'm happy the AI doesn't derp it's way into sieges, but the cities are simpler so it feels like a bit of a trade off especially with auto-ladders though its realistically the only solution to the AI's general sad panda face at the prospect of going up walls.    The AI seems to be able to competently handle its new unit types, I was particularly impressed with Chaos's use of Marauder Cav and Tundra wolves for skirmishing. However, the AI also seems to favour the 'If we engaged in a line today, we're certainly going to engage in a line tomorrow!'    There's quite alot of love thats gone into the character models from what I've seen, the art work is certainly on point. Though who ever thought Thorgrims AngryLazyBoyChair3000 was a going solution is a bit well, daft.    I haven't seemed to inherit many of the technical issues people are going on about right now. The con part of it is that theres a huge ♥♥♥♥♥torm over the technical soudness and optimisation of this game. Business as Usual for TW :P  CON-CONNERUS   Dont touch multiplayer in early days right now, its broken af. Though I suspect server load and GLORIOUS COMRADE AUSTRALIAN INTERNET is to blame.     No RPG style Shogun 2 general avatar for multiplayer. Game was basically made for that style of multiplayer and would have shined with it.   All in all, this game is worth the dollars, my hip pocket regret hasn't burned through my trousers so thats a good thing. But if you want to hold off, then I heard theres a nice steam sale something something something.     ",

I have to run on low spec due to an older system, but it still looks great. I love the Vampire Counts and, yes, if you build your province right you can field a massive host (I'm about to do battle with 3 terrorgheist!). I had no issue on start up, always a plus there, and the races feel unique which I love.  In short, if your a fan of warhammer hit this up and enjoy the power of magic!

The good:  1: Easy to pick up gameplay if you're new to any Total war game 2: Graphics are good (if you're used to COD like graphics this game is not for you) 3: Optimized very well I'm getting 40+ fps on a below Min requirement PC  4: 130 turns in with the Empire and it's still not stale. 5: Quest battles are fun and give good rewards that help you on the campaign map, I'm sure modders,DLC and FLC will add more 6: Combat is a bit slower than Attila 7 : Flying units  The Bad:  1: If you want to run this game on max settings you'll need a decent computer 2: Lack of factions 3: Magic is a bit hard to get used to  The Ugly 1: The game still needs a bit of polish in terms of hotfixes but I've been playing for 130 turns and have not run into anything game breaking.   Update. Most of the negative reviews are not legit, If I can play on my potato of a computer you'll be fine.

            "review_text": "Updated review   After having spent more than 15.000 hours with the entire Total war franchise, I can reasonably say that Total War: Warhammer contains the currently most dynamic battles so far. While this means that tactical depth has decreased over the years, playability for a wider audience has increased without having dumbed down the foundations of Total War battle mechanics. Battles are faster than in older Total War titles and battles which seem lost, usually actually are. In older Total War titles, it was possible to pull off a win by abusing certain units and the AI's reaction to them, but no more. This doesn't mean Total War has become simpler with the installment, but that the battle strength of auto-resolve as well as the AI have gotten better. Old Total War veterans may grumble about it all they want, but objectively speaking, things work a lot better now and battle outcomes make a lot more sense. While it was still possible more often than not to win a battle in Rome 2 with only 10% of autoresolve chance, it has become neigh impossible in Warhammer. And this is exactly like it should be. If the calculated outcome gives the player a 10% chance, not even the best tactician should be able to win 8 out of 10 battles. The addition of monstrous and flying units gives new tactical depth, the new (visible!) armor piercing modifiers make controlling balanced army compositions easier.  The campaign map looks amazing and while building features might be lacking in numbers compared to much older installments of the franchise, they build logically upon the changes made in Rome 2 and Attila, making things better and more accessible without really changing much. The complaint that Total War is on the path of being dumbed down is entirely unfounded and ridiculous. The series is evolving and getting more accessible without sacrificing even an inch of it's actual depth. I'd like to tell all the other veterans that things getting less tedious or annoying isn't a sign of a game being 'mainstreamified'. It's optimizing controls, UI and cutting unnecessary weight which has zero impact on depth and actual gameplay.  As for diplomacy, for the first time in what feels like forever, diplomacy feels right. You'll keep most of your allies even after extented timeframes without constant warmongering to play the system. Declarations of war from AI take a lot more into consideration and the whole game feels a lot more organic with the different factions being hard-bound to different parts of the map. Exterminating enemies has partly become a lot more difficult as you can't victory waltz over the entire map after gaining your first full province anymore.  Personally, I can't wait for the actual map to get enlarged by the planned expansions and / or DLC.  10/10. The best Total War so far.",

            "review_text": "Edited after 50 more hours of play time.  After some 50 (now 100) hours I finally felt ready to talk about this game.  First things first - the interface is a little rough on the edges and the tutorial is all but comprehensive - what leads to bad first impressions unless you're a long term fan of the series, used to the mechanics.  I'm not - at least not the latest instalments - and at first I felt this was a 'meh' game. But I endured, in part because the source material is so rich and colorful, and I'm glad I did, for this is actually a very good real time tactical (RTT) game.  The game is composed of two parts, the tactical real time battles and a turn based strategy 4x 'macro' game.  The good part is the RTT, using the true and tested Total War model.  The Total War engine is showing it's age and a lot of times it leads to frustration, but Warhammer + Total War works as a charm, as I hoped it would. The art is colorful, the lore is rich, watching the armies in action is trully emotional for a warhammer afficionado (even without the mandatory blood and gore DLC, I'm watching your shady business practices, Sega).  They managed to create completely distinct experiences for all the races, something that fix que one big flaw about the series, the almost symmetric factions. It also leads to great replayability. Once you understand the fine tunning about the stats it becomes crystal clear, every race is unique here, and you should play accordingly.  On a bad note, the 4x aspect of the game is shallow and flawed.  Diplomacy simply makes no sense (they didn't even try), you have to fight every turn to keep leveling heroes, etc. It's basically an excuse to build more and more advanced units and keep playing tactical battles. That detracts specially from the experience playing less lore-wise agressive races, like Empire and Dwarves.  Also, the game's 4x mode economy is a blatant lie, your income, even dominating most of the map, will never be enough to support more than 3 full armies. They 'kinda' fix it with cash from the nether, a fixed ammount you gain 'because so' every turn, but that only makes the economic game broken state even more obvious.  The only plus to the 4x aspect of the game is the asymmetry between the races, leading to the only actual strategic choices, specifically how agressive you have to do with or against each race.  All in all, this game is a must play for warhammer and total war fans, and if you like at least one of them, give it a shot. Can't really recomend it to 4x players tough, unless you consider the very simplistic 4x systems in this game acceptable because of the deph those tactical battles offer.",

            "review_text": "I'll try to keep this kind of short, nobody ACTUALLY likes to read.  Pros: - Campaign map is BEAUTIFUL. Really feels like it puts you into that section of the Warhammer world, and has really nice environments. - The way you level up/equip lords and use them in battle is really cool, especially considering the epic heroes of Warhammer lore; it gives you a chance to forge similar heroes in the flames of battle. - You can rename almost everything, other than factions and legendary leaders. Tiny feature, but still nice(I like to personalize my leader's army so he isn't running around with common soldiers). - Magic system is a nice feature; I feel like it is lacking in offensive spells that a single person can cast, but still refreshing and fun to use. - Real power struggle. Between the Undead, Chaos/Norsca, Dwarves, Bretonnians, Kislev, Border Princes, and provinces of the Empire, there is a lot of war going on, not just between these culture groups but with internal wars as well. It's nice, but can make it difficult. - Heroes(like the agents of previous games) can be used in battle now, which can be really nice depending on the situation. - Offers more customization with renaming, war banners that give abilities to a single unit, and lord equipment. - No more building upkeep such as food or public opinion; this is a questionable move in a game of managing your military and kingdom, but I like it. Puts more focus on war, which is naturally the key aspect of both this era in Warhammer and this game. Lots of cool little things about the game, but sadly it is tarnished with a few LARGE bad things as well.  Cons: - A miniscule five playable factions, and you have to get the game within the first week or else you're left without Chaos, which is arguably the most important faction at this point in Warhammer lore. It is based around the final rise of Chaos and the End Times, so how can you leave out that entire faction?! A pathetic money grab by an increasingly greedy company. - Factions can only take over certain settlements, and Chaos can take over none. The Chaos part I don't mind, but in a game of conquest, how can you be severely limited on what you can conquer? I know it is part of an attempt to be very accurate to the lore, but still it makes war with most of the factions completely pointless other than as a waste of your armies. A very disappointing aspect of the game. - Unit variety sucks. They'll put 3 types of the exact same unit(just with different weapons) in for a faction, but won't add another, actually unique unit? - Naval warfare? Basically non-existent in this game. - Elves, Dark Elves, Skaven, and the Chaos Dwarves were left out, which were key factions within the same conflict that is depicted in the game. Not the vital nations, but still important both in lore and fanbase. You also cannot play as Bretonnia, despite the culture and nation being there; no doubt it'll be added as a crappy DLC pack designed to steal money that shouldn't be going to CA. - Along the lines of the upkeep thing, the game is very simplified in terms of managing your faction. Honestly the only two things you really watch out for are army upkeep and corruption(this is nullified extremely easily though, upkeep as well compared to the old games). - Complete lack of building diversity in regards to economy/support. This is not entirely bad, as it allows more war-time focus for a war focused game. Still, a notably negative feature overall. - In reality, this is more along the lines of an expansion than a full game. There is a similar amount of stuff to this game as there is to the big DLCs of previous games. CA is going through this phase where they drop and/or lock content, that way they can release it later in DLCs or separate full games to take more hard-earned money from their ever-loyal fans, despite the fact that it is content that should've been in the game from the start. It is pathetic, especially for a series that was doing just fine without bleeding its fans dry. Can't wait to pay extra just to add tiny blood effects to a WARHAMMER game! Seriously, it is just wrong.  Overall, the Total War series is my all time favorite, I loved every game since the original Shogun and of course I enjoy this game a lot as well. Many nice features, but it is dragged down by a major lack of content that should have been there, and is dragged down by the poor decision making that influenced its production and release. Despite this, I would still suggest the game to any lovers of strategy games, Warhammer, or the Total War series. I love the game, in the kind of way that you love the one friend in the group that is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all of the time and doesn't really deserve your friendship, but has enough lovable qualities to make you keep them around. 7/10",

Each faction feels drastically different, a nice breath of fresh air compared to before where you'd get a lot of recycled units and factions with slight differences. The RPG-like effect of the heroes and the quests are an amazing edition and I really hope they stay committed to it for the next Total War. As a friend of mine said, imagine being able to play as the romans and dealing with political intrigue with quests and stuff.  CA have proven that they -will- listen to us, the supporters and buyers, and have pretty much fixed everything that people complained about in Rome 2 and Attila, especially the nonsensical aspect where you'd get punished for building high tier buildings. Good/bad news: no squalor. Some aspects of the game have been casualized a bit, but it's easy to get into and just, man, it's just great. I'd say it's the best Total War game since Shogun 2.

Rome 2 was very upsetting and still is to me, even with the bugs fixed its not too fun.  Figure I should probably elaborate for this game. They mostly fixed collision as in when I watch human v human its no longer pathetic like before. Seriously...this still makes me fairly upset every time I think about it since it took the devs this fricken long to fix that issue and I'n starting to feel really upset about it again now... Anyway, there is some weridness with some of the different races fighting like dwarves vs orcs but its all forgivable and it tends to err on the fun side.   The stupid crap was taken out from city management. I generally HATE when games streamline their features(looking at you dragon age and mass effect,) And you could say its been dumbed down but honestly none of the compexity in recent games was really needed. Now you pick the buildings you want for the goals you want and you don't have to take the time to balance different negatives and positives and spend more time on positioning armies, battles and diplomacy.  That being said! This game will be a adjustment for veterans. If you decide to play on a higher level difficulty you can't just muck about with military power as the game limits your army building capacity somewhat compared to previous games. Pick your strategic direction for your campaign and make sure that you are pals with everyone that is not your target. Then build additional defenses on your backside just to be sure.  Another tip for veterans. Devs took additional steps to countering your heavy infantry and heavy cavalry, you have been warned. Branch out, diversify your army, or else.  I do have complaints, but I consiter them to be minor. One is that in your quick formations all the swordsmen are on the left side, and all spear are on the right. Leaving me to switch my line up to balance it vs calavary every time.  Update10/18/16  Alright so CA releases Total War Warhammer. A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT on rome 2. God damn people WTF.

Well guess what people who downvoted for DLC- You are all late. Yeah ♥♥♥♥. Feel free to view my DLC review on Rome 2. Greek DLC pack was BS and that game did pretty well despite. In my opinion Chaos is no where near as fun for playing as the greeks. The signifiance is not the same.  I just dont understand. Why o why have we reached 'mixed?'   Do you all understand that your message is ♥♥♥♥? yeah seriously. You really think some suit will see the review and will think '♥♥♥♥, maybe we should have been more fair about DLC.' Or do you think they will see mixed and think 'thats what we get for going to a new creative direction. We should create strategy games that fit the mold.'  DLC is here to stay. All the negative reviewers based on DLC are destroying something special. Does this game have faults? Yeah . You are damn right it has some issues. So did rome 1!. But I love the direction they went in, and it really bothers me that ultimately the team will be punished for their unique direction because of their DLC policy.  I hate this.

Honestly, this is my favorite Total War game to date. The variety of different factions in the game with the really cool fantasy setting (I know nothing of the Warhammer universe, so this is freaking cool to me) and crazy units like cannon tanks, giants, vampire undead, flamethrowers, etc. Somehow though it all works together.   The battles are really awesome to watch from above and in the fray. Watching your lord and heroes go at it and wreck enemy units is great. You can tell they put a lot of love into the animations and differences between the factions. Seeing the enemy and your armies collide is quite an experience.   The campaign even has quest battles you can follow to gain certain heroes and items if you win those battles. And I love how each faction plays really differently, like the dwarfs have no horsemen, but their infantry are nasty fighters. For Greenskins if they fight constantly, they can spawn extra AI rmies for help. But if there's a lull in the fighting you risk watching your greenskin armies go down in attrition because they love fighting.  Game also runs really well for me on my 980 Ti and i7 3770K, compared with previous titles. Even the end round turns go faster now and the game loads quicker.  Also Workshop support is a plus. Already tons of mods on day 1.  My only problems is I'd love to see more factions and the multiplayer is completely barebones at the moment. I'm surprised they didn't add the avatar system from Shogun 2 to the multiplayer of Total War Warhammer. Would be perfect with the different lords of each faction in my opinion.   The multiplayer campaign I tried also for ten hours and it worked pretty well so far. And there's a workshop mod that allows you to play the same faction but different lords.  I think in general CA nailed this game. I recommend it.",

Running low on money and reserves as the war had been at a stalemate for many many moons.... at this bleakest point a message was delivered to our lord.

Yes, even Shogun 2 which everyone seems to be talking about as the last great game in the franchise. I thought it was really uninteresting to play. I'm also a big Warhammer fan, who has been largely underwhelmed with modern video game adaptations such as they are. I nearly didn't pre-order Total Warhammer.   I'm glad I did, it is in my opinion the (equal) best Total War game to date, matching the originals inventiveness and experimental nature. I love it.  My PC is not good. I have a good graphics card but my CPU is five years old and is rubbish. I can still play Total Warhammer on the recommended settings with a better framerate than I've had in a TW game in five years. I've had no technical issues whtsoever, no crashes or freezes or slowdowns or anything.  The graphics are fantastic. The Warhammer World has never looked so good, and it looks good even with the settings set fairly low. I do have some criticisms of some design elements, combat animations are a bit less interesting than previous games but honestly I'd rather that get patched in later and have the dev team focus on delivering a stable game first which is what seems to have happened.  Gameplay is excellent. Each race (I've only played Vampire Counts, Empire and Dwarfs so far, no Orcs or Chaoss) has a distinct play style that actually works, and each unit type seems to have a value when you use it properly. I tended to end up with cookie cutter armies in most previous installments but I find myself building widely variant armies in this installment, and having success with them. The campaign map and city building elements are familiar with no major innovations I think but its well executed and easy to use. AI seems much improved. Skealing and Varg races in particular were downright cunning, sending armies right down the coast to raid my souther cities while harassing me in the north. Unlike in previous games there was actually a patchwork of AI powers that formed a fairly stable bloc of nations to the south rather than being dominated by one race (though the very south ended up being controlled by teh dwarfs after they successfully destroyed all the orc tribes). Diplomacy is MUCH better, I actually started getting offers of peace and trade from AI at sensible times intead of waiting until I was besieging their final city to sue for peace. Sometimes a war would end as soon as it would begin because I'd come to an allies aid and the aggressor would throw money at me.  Battle AI seems improved too, with all the races using tactics suited to their unit roster. Battles have been challenging without being unbalanced for the difficulty level.  I don't feel only having four or five playable factions at the start is a negative, not when each plays so differently. Having said that I am looking forward to getting more factions to play, especially Elves. Dark and Wood Elves would offer possibility for some really novel ways of shaking up the faction dynamic. Wood Elves expanding into forest rather than settlements, Dark Elves operating from Black Arks along the coast rather than traditional settlements and so forth. Maybe they won't go down that path but its fun to speculate.  I do have a few minor general criticisms: -The Skaeling and Varg seem to be far too powerful early on. I've yet to see Kislev hold onto more than one settlement by turn 50, they get slaughtered by the Norsca tribes and then WoC come and finish them off. Having that happen sometimes is fine, having Kisleb be destroyed every time not so much. They just serve as a speedbump for Chaos.  -Where are the women? Seriously. Kislev is ruled by a woman and they couldn't even muster the resources to put her in game? Same for the Elector Countess of Nuln, I saw several of the other Elector Counts like Marius Leitdorf but the woman gets left out? The Empire has never been as sexist as the history on which it is based, its had empresses before and women electors and city rulers are not unusual. There are even female knights in the novels, and female wizards have been present in the lore since forever as well, all absent from the game. It gets even worse with Vampire Counts, where they have portraits and in game models for female vampires but limit them only to heroes when WFB has had female vampire lords for DECADES. I'm not talking Neferata either but von Carsteins and others. The Lahmians have a whole shadow empire going on AND have led forces into battle in some of the novels but again, completely absent from the game. I'm a guy, this isn't some political issue, this is accuracy to the source material being ignored, its frustrating. If I'm negotiating with Kislev I want to see the damned Queen of Kislev ok, not just hear about her from an NPC. Dwarven queens leading armies into battle is canon too, just saying. You can't cite historical accuracy this time CA, you're messing up the source material out of laziness. I swear if Alarielle isn't a legendary lord for High Elves I will be furious.  -A bit more variety in town design on the campaign map would be nice. Like I said these are not huge issues, but Altdorf looks basically the same as Middenheim which looks the same as Talabheim etc. Or if there are differences they are so minor I missed them.  Anyway, minor complaints aside this is an AMAZING game, 9/10, best Total War game since the original.",

            "review_text": "Only have played the campaign and a couple custom battles. I have to say that the game runs great so far (caveat of only playing a few hours so far) and it really gets you into the warhammer universe. I will post more as I get farther along, but as of right now I recommend this game.  EDIT: After playing through a full campaign on Normal with the Dwarves, I can say I am really digging this game, especially compared to the previous outings, again my opinion.  PROS: -Game runs great, I have a relatively new gaming laptop, and I have the settings maxed out. I had the same settings for Attila as well as Rome II, and this game smokes it in terms of performance. Having 4 armies on screen duking it out, Dwarves vs Orks is something to behold.  -I like what they did with the sieges. It was a bit confusing at first as I didn't read all the previews for this game, so not seeing city battles was a surprise but I think this works well.  -Lore. I used to play the old warhammer RTS games back in the day, and this brings it right back but even more. If you are a fan of this universe or just fantasy in general I think you'll be hard pressed to find a better Fantasy big battle RTS game.  -Races. I will caveat that I have only played the campaign for the dwarves, but just the differences between all the races is refreshing. It really makes you rethink strategy and how to make your race work for you.  -Battles. Some say the tactical battles are dumbed down, in terms of setting formations etc. but I think with the addition of magic and the wide variety of units it just makes it that much more complex and it just means you might spend a bit more time setting up your deployment.  CONS: -Diplomacy. Right now in its current form it is pretty underutilized. I understand that Dwarves and Orks won't ever ally but at least when working with the humans or other dwarf factions there could be a bit more to it. I found that for almost the first 100 turns I didn't even bother with the diplomacy tab. The other gripe, and it needs to be fixed as it is a pretty big bug in my opinion is the go to war / declare peace with monetary offerings. Numerous times other dwarf factions would go to war with the undead only for the undead to offer a peace treaty with X gold payment. Why of course I will take your money! Only to follow 2 turns later by the dwarfs offering money for me to go back to war with the undead. 2 payments to remain as the status quo.   -Difficulty/Campaign map. Granted I only played on normal, but I found the layout of the world map led me to only have to really deal with orcs in the south while everyone else fought for life up north, especially when Chaos came a'knockin'. I think there could be some work there, or please speak up if maybe I just need to up the difficulty level.  -Graphic glitches. I did say the game ran like silk, but during loading screens and sometimes on the campaign map the screen would blank for a split second then return. I enabled Vsync (I have a gsync monitor so I didn't think I needed to do this) and that seemed to remove the problem.  -Heroes. I have found that I just preferred them to be in my army instead of running around doing their hero thing. It didn't affect me in the least, so there might be some updating needing to be done with that as well.  -Capturing settlements. I like the idea that dwarves can only take orc settlements and vice versa, and same goes for humans and vampires. However, it does make it a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ when heading up north to fight, and never having a base to replenish the troops besides encamping. I think this is just something that I have to get used to.   OVERALL:  I think the game is great, the best running for sure compared to the other recent releases from CA. This is different from Attila and Rome, but for me that works and I actually prefer it.  I highly recommend this game for the lore, fantasy and the beautiful battles. With the future DLC options and patches I'm sure, this game will only get better.  9/10  -Ezekiel",

The Warhammer fantasy setting is less restricting to gameplay since it does need to be historically accurate. Each race in the game is truly unique and has their own mechanics, so If I want to do another playthrough of the game it does not feel like i'm just playing a reskin of another faction. The quest and loot systems add fun new mechanics to help make gameplay diverse and interesting. Diplomacy seems a lot better than past games , as AI is now willing to accept deals if your friendly with them for the most part. AI will now declare war on you if they don't like you, it doesn't matter your strength.This creates a greater need to play smart diplomatically and you can't just steam roll over factions. The only thing I kinda have a problem with is how the game reduces unit sizes depending on your graphics settings, so it was a bit annoying trying to figure out why my units were only at 30 in size when other people played with 120 soldiers in a unit. Overall this is a great addition to the Total War franchise. I would highly recommend to any fan of fantasy or Total War games.  9/10",

            "review_text": "First, I have not encountered any major bugs. The game appears to function as intended, and all the main systems seem to work. Balancing may need another pass, but that's easier to fix than the underlying systems. On to impressions, which I'll divide into Campaign, Battles, and Performance.  Campaign  The campaign map features the usual settlement building now familiar from Rome 2 and Attila, but some of the negative effects have been removed, making the overall decision making much simpler. There are very obvious choices to be made, and no real tradeoffs for whatever approach you take. It's more a matter of 'when' to build, not 'what' to build. One interesting change is that techs available to research are now based on what buildings you have. Want to research army techs? Build a barracks. Seasons have been replaced with a generic 'turn counter', so there are no seasonal effects or time dimensional attributes for characters (ie. no aging/dying from age).   omg there's no family tree!! I only put this here because I saw so much consternation over a lack of family trees in Rome 2. Well they are gone again. There is a system of offices somewhat like Attila, but it's pretty simple stuff. No aging and no loyalty system either, just heroes and lords and skill trees for each. The character skill trees are more dynamic than they were in the last two games, with buffs to either personal stats, army stats, or province/empire stats, each area having its own tree to customize as you level. This leads to some interesting choices which come early and often - heroes/lords level pretty fast, about once per battle/mission in my experience. Characters can also have equips (slots for armor, weapons, trinket), special mounts (achieved in the skill tree), and followers, all of which provide addtional buffs or abilities than can be invoked in battle. All in all, the characters provide a decent 'role play' type experience.  The rest of the campaign map is pretty standard fare for a Total War game. There are settlements and provinces that will be familiar to players of Rome 2 and Attila. The diplomacy offers little new (although it seems slightly more transparent than previous iterations). One additional change is the 'Winds of magic' that vary from time to time on the map, and determine how much magic energy will be available in a battle. Low winds - longer recharge for spells and such; high winds - you get the picture.  Battles  Let's get this out of the way: Lords and Heroes are completely overpowered, but they are meant to be. One lord can wade into a 90 man unit of swordsmen and just start demolishing them - swing their weapon and bodies fly everywhere. Or they can stand back and sling spells that buff/debuff as needed, or do direct damage (of assorted types) to the enemy. All this feels kind of like the General abilities from previous TW titles, but on massive steroids.  Next thing to note is that battles play out fast; I would have thought that mirroring a table-top game would lend itself to slower, more methodical play. Wrong. Once armies engage it is a rush to use abilities where needed, apply your lords/heroes to trouble spots, find the right match-ups for units and reposition as required.... Many times however, I've found the best option to be to take out the enemy leader, and then their army will usually crumble (quite literally when fighting Vampire armies). Regardless, most battles are over within minutes once the two sides engage. A more 'thoughtful' pace would have been nice.  There's still the typical rock-paper-scissor set up among troops - missile units &gt; swords &gt; spears &gt; cavalry &gt; missile units - with some variation such as halberds excelling vs. 'large' units. The battlefields themselves are mostly pretty plain once you strip away all the non-interactive backdrops. I've fought on some interesting hilly terrain, but the majority of the battles have taken place on level ground, often with pretty stuff in the distance.  The 'feel' of each race is nicely differentiated; the Empire wants to form a line and hold their ground, while the undead usually want to swarm the enemy. Races are also differentiated by some not having particular units, thus enforcing a different 'feel' to playing them.  Performance  The game looks and runs great for me on the default 'High' settings. I did bump AA up to MLAA from the default of none; no noticeable hit to performance. Also note that I have the game installed on my SSD, and with that said, load times are negligible. There is also an 'Ultra' setting for the graphics, but I do not dare.... My system specs for comparison's sake: ------------------ System Information ------------------  Operating System: Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1  Processor: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor (6 CPUs), ~3.5GHz  Memory: 16384MB RAM  DirectX Version: DirectX 11 --------------- Display Devices ---------------  Card name: AMD Radeon (TM) R9 200 Series (x2)  Display Memory: 4095 MB  Current Mode: 1920 x 1080 (32 bit) (60Hz) ------------------------ Disk &amp; DVD/CD-ROM Drives ------------------------  Drive: C:  Free Space: 299.0 GB  Total Space: 488.3 GB  Model: Crucial_ CT512MX100SSD1 SATA Disk Device   Well?  I have to admit, I'm enjoying the game more than I thought I would. I know next to nothing about Warhammer (and so will not comment on attention to lore), but I'm a fan of fantasy games and a Total War enthusiast (aka fanboi). With that said, the game checks all the boxes for me. However, I'm afraid tabletop Warhammer fans will be disappointed by the seemingly twitch-speed battles, while Total War fans may find the campaign over-simplified and the OP Lords slashing through enemy units somewhat laughable. The production values and attention to detail appear top-notch though, so perhaps the game finds the correct middle ground for all that and will please everyone. If anything of that rings true for you, then I would definitely recommend giving it a try.",

            "review_text": "Total War: Warhammer   For those that want a quick overview of my opinion here it is: this game is the best total war to date, runs very well and truly captures the feeling of the Warhammer universe in a way that no other video game has before. There are some aspects of the game that may displease Total War fans but the changes all make perfect sense in the context of the Warhammer theme. If you like Warhammer and have longed for a PC version of the tabletop game this is it.  Now for the more detailed account.   1: Technical Stuff  The game seems to be very polished and it runs really well. I have a moderate PC (GTX770, i5-Haswell) and I can run it on ‘Very High’ settings with a very stable 60fps during battles. I did have a bit of an issue with the in-game V-Sync option causing odd screen tearing, but that was sorted by using a software sync in the NVidia panel.   The tactical map runs well too, and the AI seems to get its turns over nice and quickly. All in all, this game seems to be free from the technical bugs that dogged the Rome II release.   2: Changes to the Total War Formula  The game retains all of the classic Total War gameplay, however it does feel very different to classic Total War games. The focus is much narrower than Rome-II, more in line with that of Shogun-II. One of the biggest changes is the freedom that the fantasy setting has given CA when it comes to making the different playable races unique. Each of the four basic factions have very different rules that govern their approach to battle. The Dwarves, for example, have to redress slights and attacks against them less they become unhappy and start to rebel. The Orcs and Goblins have to keep fighting turn after turn less they start to brawl with one another and suffer attrition. These unique characteristics really seem to change up the way that the tactical side of the game plays and help a great deal when getting into the theme of a given faction.   But where the game really shines is in the sheer variety of units on offer. Where as in previous TW games most of the armies were composed of some combination of spearmen, swordsmen, archers and cavalry, here the armies contain really characterful and fun units that make them stand out a great deal. The Dwarves, which are the faction I have been playing the most so far, are able to build all manner of crazy war-machines from Gyro-copters (steam powered one-man helicopters) to Organ Guns (mad fantasy Gatling guns). By contrast, the Orcs and Goblins have access to Doom Divers, which see goblins firing themselves out of massive catapults and swooping down into the enemies ranks. There are far too many units to mention here but the main point is simply that each of the armies is unique and fun.   Furthermore, this asymmetrical nature of the armies adds to how the battles play out. Dwarves try to take up defensive lines, making the most of their artillery before finishing off their foe with powerful and heavily armed melee troops. Orcs and Goblins rush in in a massive frenzy and attempt to overwhelm their opponent and so forth.  And perhaps finally there is magic. This comes into play differently for each of the various factions. However, it presents itself as either battlefield spells cast by magical units such as wizards and shaman, or as special items that character units can carry into battle in order to boost their abilities. This magic is well integrated into the game, offering an interesting and tactically significant aspect to the battles.    3: Worries about content  I’ve heard quite a lot of worry about the fact that there are only four factions in this game. When compare with the massive amount of nations in Rome-II it may seem small. However, as I talked about above, the variety on offer here is tenfold that found in previous TW games. Rather than having myriad Celtic and Greek factions that all play roughly the same, here we have four very different factions, each filled with character and unique design. This in no way feels like a short-changed game.    4: Conclusions  As you can no doubt tell I love this game. It’s all that I was hoping that it would be and a great deal more. I’ve been playing TW games since they first game out. I’ve also played Warhammer table-top many years ago when I was a kid. Bringing the two together here is just fantastic. The fantasy setting seems to have allowed CA to come up with some fantastic ideas and it just feels like it fits the game style so much better than the historical games that they have previously released. I’m in no doubt that this game is going to be one that I play for many years to come.  If you like TW games, like Warhammer or even better like both then getting this is a no brainer. For those that don’t like the previous TW games but have an interest in the setting it is certainly worth looking into. The game feels better polished than any that have come before it and the theme is rich.  ",

Given some of my issues with the series, particularly Attila, and the frustrating gameplay and technical issues I encountered, I was initially dubious about this title.   I was in no way disappointed this time round though.  First off, I'm running the game on high custom settings with textures, unit, buildings and foliage on ultra, and it is running at a comfortable 50fps on a laptop (admittedly a gaming one), the same one which barely ran Attila. The detail is still astounding and the visuals don't cease to impress. Twelve hours in and I'm still getting *wow* moments, with my eyes out on stalks as my battle wizard dude blasts a comet into the middle of the foe. Hell, who cares if I'm losing this battle and Karl Franz is about to be crushed by a giant, I'm just revelling in the sheer beauty of it all- step on the bugger for all I care- just look at all the pretty effects...   The gameplay mechanics are pretty much as you'll remember them from previous titles but with plenty of novelty too- spellcasting is an interesting new tactical addition, and each of the factions feels radically different to the others. While the Empire (my preferred faction) plays quite conventionally in most ways, other factions have a very different style of play- eg. Vampire Counts are different in terms of recruitment, while Chaos don't have any cities, a similar gameplay feature to Attila and the hordes there.  Speaking of hordes, without giving too much away, for the love of Sigmar, do NOT, as the Empire (or anyone for that matter), ignore the defence of your north eastern borders. You think you're the dog's b*ll*cks right now, pushing around city states and dukedoms, gathering in your taxes and acting like you've got it all sorted, but I promise you- however ready you think you are for the slathering hordes of ravenous lunatics, you are emphatically not- stock up on heavy artillery. And pray.  Finally, and most wondrously- there are no more naval battles! Long overdue...  And now, back to purging the taint of Chaos from my lands...",

This is because in the base-game, you cannot play as the same faction as your friend in co-op, however you can if you download a third-party mod that was helped created by CA, but this does not include the Chaos.  This means the only factions working together that make somewhat sense, are The Empire and Dwarves. You can't take seeing Vampires and Humans or Dwarves and Orcs working together seriously, can you? I certainly can't.  I don't care if CA helped create the mod that allows you to work together as the same faction minus the Chaos, to me, this is something that should have been in the base-game in the first place, and by not having it, has ruined the co-op experience for me and my friends. So I repeat, if you're planning on playing co-op with a friend, and you want to work together as the Chaos and consume everything together like me and my friend did, I do not recommend you get this game, as you cannot, even with the mod.

The Total War series is based on two very diffrent gameplays mixed into one game. The first is on the caimpaign screen. This is where you build your armies, conquer territory and build up your nation. If you've played games like starcraft or solar empire you'll understand the jist of it, and actually campared to those games this element is very simple and straightforeward. Though you can still mess it up if you're not carefull.   The battle system is were total war shines. You can take direct control of the armies you built in the caimpaign map and use them against your enimeis in a real time battle. This system can be daunting at first, but you'll realize that its farily simple to learn but difficult to master. With proper stategy and tactices you'll eventually be able to take on enemy armies that vastly out match you simply by using good strategy.   This game setting is based on the very famous Tabletop Wargaming setting called Warhammer. If you haven't heard of it don't worry. The setting is a dervitive of many diffrent fantasy troups and settings, So anybody could get the jist of the story within the first few minutes of play. You've got the empire of man, based on The Holy Roman Empire. Your Dwarves, which are your typical short, bearded, grumpy anglo-saxons. The Vampire/Necromancer faction, who are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Greenskins, a bunch of big green soccer holigans who just want to scrap. And the Chaos Warriors, who are basically a bunch of Cthulhu worrshiping death-metal fanatic vikings that have taken apon themselves to end the world. Each of these factions are very flavorful and fundementally change the basic gameplay in subtle but interestig ways. The dwarves are very defensive, while the greenskins and chaos are very offensive, the empires are good generalists ect.   If you are not new to the setting, and like me are a fan you'll be pleased to know that this game treats the lore well and implements it fantastically into the gameplay. I would go so far as to say this is the best Warhammer fantasy game ever made. It might be the best Warhammer IP game ever, including the Dawn of War series. Althought thats a tough call to make.  Finally, I have had no techinical issues with this game what so ever. Furthermore I haven't heard of anyone having any issues once they downloaded the day one patch.   These two IPs were made for each other, and they've come together beatifully here. If you are a fan of the IP you need to check it out some time. And if you have any interest in realtime or turn based strategy I highly recomend this game to anyone whose interested.",

PROS: - awesome optimization, especially compared to Attila - solid gameplay, well balanced so far - combat feels fun and impactful - overall very clear and aesthetically pleasing UI - fantastic music and sound - excellent inter/intra faction diversity in all aspects (theme, tech, units, tactics, etc)  CONS: - some minor graphical glitches (occasional screen stutter) - some AI armies unit composition could use improvement (entire cav armies), but this is largely personal preference  No other cons worth reporting so far  Would highly recommend the game, very fun departure from usual scope and theme of the TW series.",

It's not really a game that you can sit down and just play for a few minutes, and it can be really hard to get into at first, which can be a bit of a turn off. But once you get the hang of the basics and find a faction that you really like, it gets so much better. The amount of DLC can be a little offputting for some, which is understandable, but with the amount of work that goes into each piece of DLC (which get better with every one) it's well worth it. If you feel like it's out of your price point, you can head to reddit because there's a good amount of 20% off codes floating around, or just wait for a steam sale and pick it up. Overall, It's a great game that takes a little time to get into, but pays for itself after that.",

The AI has also been drastically improved upon as it will often try to flank around your armies and change strategy throughout the course of a battle.  The addition of the Chaos Invasion that occurs later on in the campaign and Heros/Generals that finally feel important due to their critical role in battles only helps add to an already brilliant game.

            "review_text": "Ok so this is my first review, and so well see how this goes. So I used to be one of the fps console pesants, but I moved over to pc and started to play Planetside and CSGO, which brought me here to steam. Where there are all these different styles of games. I mostly stuck with the FPS genre till some of my friends got me into civ, and others into Supreme commander 2, Never thought I would like those games but my friends forced me into buying them, and so I did and don't regret a thing.  But now leads me to the actual review and summary of the game thing. This game is really a great combination and melting pot of the RTS and civ style games. The Whole city building aspects are much better than civ becaue not only do you have to make the right choices inorder for your army to survive you also have to figure out if you want to have it produce money or be a strong defensive city. The process of creating an army is definatly a lot better than supreme commander because not only is it easier to group who goes where and all that but you can make a strategy for one army and not your entire force. The combat system for this game is basically a mix of RTS and civ because you can choose to auto-resovle it, or sit there and fight it out in an rts style. Which is definatly one of the best features. Another thing I love about this game is how each faction is completley different unlike in civ where you can have slightly different units or the have the same things as the other groups, and like some of the RTS games I have played there is no special way of aquiring the different types of units for the faction ( if that makes sense). But the different factions or races definatly set this game apart with their diverstiy.  now for my problems with the game. I wish there could be away to do multiplayer campaings with more than 2 people, but I know why there isnt because of how long the turns take. And I also whish that as a dwarf I could play as The Barak Varr (One of the other dwarf factions) but rather you are stuck to the Dwarfs, Empire, or greenskins.  But obviously every other aspect of the game beat out these few problems that may change in the upcoming updates. SO GO BUY THE GAME RIGHT NOW YOU WON'T REGRET IT. Plus you get the Chaos Warriors for free if you do it soon.",

Lack of playable factions is a bit frustrating but aside from that i really cant see any other huge downside. they removed 'unfortified town' battles , for me this is a huge let down as i loved deffending them against uneven chances and was looking forward to fending off a town against masses of undead but sadly i could not. That is more of a personal thing though and there are plenty of siege battles to make up for it.  Quest battles are interesting and make a nice replacement to the 'historical battles' though overall i will say shoguns historical battles still take the gold from me. The singleplayer/co-op is really fun and i enjoyed corrupting the lands as the vampire counts. the game adds new layers of stratergy to a already fantastic series of games. Truely enjoyed playing this game and will do for many weeks to come.  Worth buying if you have the spare cash but set aside some more for DLC as im sure there will be lots to come, if you want the full experiance of ANY total war game i suggest buying all DLC so please dont take the initial price as the full price.  8/10 in my books putting it on level with shogun 2 as the joint best total war game for me!",

I wish all legendary lords could ride mounts such as Sigvard the Magnificent who is just a human dude who cant even ride a horse for some odd reason and Archeon only gets a little horse when a regular lord can mount a chaos dragon is just odd, something im sure modders will fix so np.

            "review_text": "Great fun game, the game has had many changes to the days of Atila and the rage of Rome 2. The game by far (in my opinion) is better than the both of them, where they fell short it by the mechanics and how much each game consumed of my beastly PC. This game runs much better, any improvement there was much better than CA's history.  Gameplay wise the game has been definitely changed. By making it more complex, yet simpler. It is basic when it comes to how you manage and control the land. The main focus is definitely on the way you construct and manage your settlements. It is sad going from the complexity of Shogun's complex system where they gave you everything you needed for it. It was fun, where it picks up from the micro managing is how it does it's combat. It has never been more refined. After almost 8 years of their games having terrible routing AI. The complexity of leveling your heroes and lords and the combat of it is great. I will never not appreciate it. The way it works now is when you are in combat you will also have to manage *EVERYTHING* If you play Empire and you decide to have a light wizard. In the didst of battle you will haave to manage hif effectively to buff the minions that best need support. It has grown greatlt with it's complexity.   Onto Campaign, you can play as multiple legendary lords from all five factions. They go Empire, Vampire Count, Dwarfs, Greenskins and Chaos Warriors. Each of them are complex in the ways they play and work out, Empire is by having good diplomacy and by building up your foundry and Sigmat of Wizards, they will give your infantry a giant boost with items like Cannons and the beloved Steam Tank. It depends on how you would build your campaign, you could've built up the DemiGryphs early, or gone for the Luminarch. It is very great in how you manage your garrison. I have played as all the factions, it depends who you like the most, mine is the Empire. You can build your characters in multiple ways leading to replay campaigns just for different ways you began, did you start by being so aggro you took all the necissary land by turn 40. Or building the best (balanced) army that will prevent as much casualties. It even goes into how you build your characters. It is very very fun.  These were some of the main reasons I liked this game, it was great. The game does have bugs though, if you are watching the intro cutscene and skip when the logos pop up, it will give the game stutering issues. For me it wasn't fixed until I was forced to watch the 8+ minute intro cutscene. It goes stale after the first watch so you would want to skip it, but it causes graphical issues and stuttering. Otherwise I haven't encountered many bugs that are memorable enough to list. CA has certainly improved while I am impressed. I thank them for fixing the true issues.",

            "review_text": "I’ve played all the campaigns now, including the Chaos DLC, so here’s my review.  It’s a good Total War (TW) game and it’s a good Warhammer Fantasy Game. There is a great diversity between the playable races/campaigns (thanks Warhammer universe) and it’s a great adaptation of the Warhammer lore. The new tactical gameplay elements like flyers and magic work well and in a way that makes sense. So far the game seemed pretty well balanced, although I didn’t try to break anything either.  The strategic gameplay between battles is a bit more restricted than in a usual TW game. You cannot colonize any settlement you like anymore, there are race specific restrictions. This might seem like a step back for a TW veteran and apparently there is already a mod for it. To me it makes total sense in respect to Warhammer lore. Humans, Dwarfs, Chaos, Orcs etc. don’t live in the same places. This changes the gameplay quite a bit compared to older TW games and leads to more “excursions”, where you send armies far away from your territories.  The “city management” aspect of the game with food and things like that got completely removed. There is now only happiness and money to worry about and all buildings only have positive influences on said things. It’s more like a real-time strategy game: More buildings = more resources and better units. I really welcome this change and I think if you like to manage, other games are more suited for you than TW. In this game they focused more on RPG elements during the campaign, with equipment and quest battles for you generals. I think these are great additions to the game and so much better than the previous “historic battles”.  A quick word on the AI which is a known weakness of TW games: It’s solid. I neither saw it do something really stupid nor did it blow my mind. I feel like it has gotten a lot less suicidal though and much better at running away from fights it can’t win. Meaning there is more chasing which can be tedious, but that’s what I would do so I can’t blame the AI. A week after release the game still suffers from bugs. Some of which seem really trivial, like keys that don’t work the same way as there corresponding UI buttons. However, it’s nothing like the hot mess that was previous TW games. Definitely a big step in the right direction. The main issues I had when playing where UI related. Often it’s really hard to figure out what a certain upgrade for a unit actually does. For example the attribute “causes Fear” reduces the enemy’s leadership (moral) but I still don’t know by how much and at what range. Or in the chaos campaign you need to build encampments in order to heal and recruit units, which you can only do if you didn’t use more than 75% of your movement. But there is no indicator to tell you how far that is, you can only see the movement you have left. This leads to me going forward in tiny baby steps, which seems unworthy of Archaon the Everchosen. It’s little things like that which add up and dampen the overall experience somewhat. The same goes for the DLC policy of Creative Assembly (CA) and SEGA. The fact that Chaos is not part of the base game just feels bad, even though I got it “for free” when I bought the game. Also the Bretonians are right there but they are not playable right now. I don’t know, I see it as prelude of worse things to come. Optimism is for suckers amirite.  All in all I return to my initial statement: It’s a good Total War game and it’s a good Warhammer game. Now you deserve a cookie for reading all that! ",

I\\'ve been a fan of the Total War series since Medieval I, and I\\'ve also had a passing interest in Warhammer fantasy though 40k has always seemed to be at the forefront of attention in gaming, so the stakes were as high for GW as they were for CA. They really straddled the fine line of keeping the game in line with the Total War experience as well as doing immense justice to the source material.   The world is more or less 1 continent, but the lack of a lot of factions to play with is made up for by the immense differences between each faction. Although you can\\'t play as certain factions like the Bretonnians, they will almost assuredly be added to the playable roster (DLC of course). Many people don\\'t seem to like that certain races are locked on what provinces they can conquer: for instance dwarves can\\'t capture human cities, only dwarven holds and goblin towns. In fact the most popular mod right now is one that allows you to conquer every city. I think CA made the best decision on this since it wouldn\\'t make sense lore-wise for races with vastly different cultures to be able to reliably keep control of the province. Attila was actually somewhat in line with this too as I recall, because playing as the Franks converting Roman towns was immensely expensive and the incessant rebellions really detracted from the experience. But back to Total Warhammer: Even design wise it makes sense that factions are locked by what cities they can hold. Ork cities for instance are basically dwarf towns with orky bits. So if I download this mod and conquer a human city as the orks, they\\'re going to build a giant dwarf statue just to put a big skull on it? tldr there was a lot they could have ♥♥♥♥ed up with this and it really came out great, looking forward to new campaigns/maps  ",

This game is called 'Total War' but sometimes I just want to give that minor settlement back to kislev instead of just raxing it or occupying it.  2) No alliance war leaders. The diplomacy system is still a little dated in that when you goto the peace tables it is alone; which will really ♥♥♥♥ off your ally if they are still in the war. Would love to have the ability to negotiate on behalf of an entire alliance a la Vic2 or EU4. 3) AI is better about declaring war, however I have noticed that there are still times that two VERY friendly with each other allies of mine will declare war on each other. Also the AI choosing to goto war with people that are 2-3 provinces away with no path to them. Again, see Vic2 or EU4 for a much more polished diplo situation.   These are MINOR complaints because this isnt Total Diplomacy: Warhammer.   Buy this game if you like the thought of pitting mounted knights against giant mutated vampire bats.",

Luckily they actully put me out of my misery because this game seems to be a constant stream of lying to people and saying you wont butcher their armies and lords like the animals they are and then making them pay you off for another 5 turns until you continue to ♥♥♥♥ and pillage their lands again. Fun game.",

            "review_text": "'Let 'em tell da King. Da east belongs to da Orcs. Da east belongs to Morglum. Da east is green.'  For the base game of Total War: Warhammer you get 4 playable factions; The early imperial age Empire, the grudging Dwarfs, the corrupting necromancers of the Vampire Counts and the warmongering Greenskins.  However in some month from now it will be 5 factions, as the feudal age themed Bretonnia will come as a free DLC faction.  The base game I believe is worth 40 bucks in my opinion. Look around for sales and what not.  A very fun strategy game watching and directing massive armies having a go at each other. As well as building up your empire in the Grand Campaign (the main focus of the game, online pvp is more focused on skirmishes but you can play co-op grand campaign).  There are a few issues with the game. The game requires some power from your PC to work, so a toaster PC won't get much out of this game. But then so has all Total War games been with PCs of their release. This game however is fairly optimized and runs well on 'mid range' computer. Just not with highest unit sizes and graphics.  Sieges are another issue, the sieges in this game are not very exciting to deal with. There's a lack of ingenuity here and what we're given is like the very bare bones. I personally hope they will give us a 'siege' update sometime down the line to give sieges their rightful level of epicness.  Then there's the annoying 'agent spam'. In which on the world map the AI will send their armada of agents on your armies to kill units and try to assassinate your lords (those who lead armies). This however is simply fixed with a mod that stops aggressive agent actions.  Which brings up another good thing, the mod community/steam workshop is great. There are plenty of mods there to use that makes the game look prettier, changes the AI more to your liking and even giving you new units (by modding current unit models, swapping parts around and so son) to play around with would the standard set of units not tickle your pickle enough. If you never done mods on steam before its as simple as it gets. Just click Subscribe on a mod you want to use and it's ready to go in like a second.  Creative Assembly keeps improving their DLC with each release. All but Beastmen are well worth their money (Warriors of Chaos faction is currently feeling unrefined as of this review). Creative Assembly is also generous with the free content they give us that tends to come with each DLC release. So even if you don't buy DLC you will get something new anyways!  I firmly put my trust in CA for this game, they prove again and again with all the shortcomings they've had that they are willing to give us, the community, the deals we want. The game will have a crap ton of DLC as well as 2 expansions that will expand the Grand Campaign map to cover the whole Warhammer Fantasy world (not counting other dimensions and that sorta stuff). With a little digging you can see all the stuff Creative wished to have in the game but had to be axed to meet deadline. Such as naval warfare and banners for units.  I believe the earlier you join this game's life journey, the richer the experience will be for you as each time new content comes out there will be a new draft of fresh air. And you can look back at all the experiences you had, the days before X faction had Y units to deal with Z scenario and the like.  It's a fantastic game and one I will surely play many years ahead. Just like with what I did with Medieval 2 Total War.",

Even on Legendary, battles are winnable, including some epic outmatched fights.  The strategic game is still a step backwards from Shogun 2 however. Diplomacy in general is difficult to impossible on Legendary, even with hefty bribes. There are other questionable design decisions, like the ludicrously massive Confederation penalty for the Empire. The quests are also far fetch-quest for the most part - in my most accomplished Legendary Empire playthrough, Karl Franz is level 19 and has long since unlocked every quest - yet accomplishing even a single major questline is - strategically speaking - very, very difficult (I haven't even come close.)

It's a different game, of course it's not the same, judge it like a separate game.  - Villages can't be sieged and the battles are outside it. Really? Are you saying me that you enjoyed of the annoying sieges in small towns and the need to carry on Balistas Cannons or Trebuchet? You must be mad.   - Cities are identical. Don't know what game are you playing guys, but the Capitals, Castles and Buildings are different in each race. Decoration change and the truth is that it's spectacular.  - There's no Blood. Now, be patient, there will be, specially when modding is allowed.   - Laggy and bad performance. Bull♥♥♥♥. This game is with a big difference the best optimized Total War game. Runs smooth and even with a Crappy Graphic card you can play High at 30 fps.   - Battles are arcade. That's not true, the strategy still counts, It's just less complicated, with less formations. For me it's fun, and the Magic add a new variable that you have to consider. Also the fact that Morale runs out so fast force you to raise the leadership, bonus and counter it. BTW Charges are SIMPLY GLORIOUS.   I think that people should be Honest and review a game without looking into other mirrors. This is not Rome 2 or Attila, it's a different game. An approach to Warhammer Universe with the Total War Style or Perspective. I'm Warhammer Board game player and Total War Player since first Shogun and guys, i love this. We know that Hater's gonna hate allways, but I strongly disagree with them.   Buy it, this is a 8-9 score game. PD: Charges are GLORIOUS. They are so spectacular that you'll abuse of the cinematic camera.",

A more narrative driven game rather than only a 'go take the next town, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next.....' kind of Total War Game (improvement!). Now there are actually considerable garrisons in the game (improvment!). Graphics is as a bit better than Attila, which you would expect/demand to be there. Generals/heroes/lords that matters and kick ♥♥♥ with a large skill tree system and loot to gear them up with weapons, armor and more. AI is not a total idiot and actually works pretty good, although it is not perfect (improvement!). Music and sounds are pretty good. New cool quest mechanics such as The Book of Grudges. Air combat and flying units!   Cons: Too few quest battles. Quest mechanics are not as great as it could be. The campaign map is small. Campaigns are not very long compared to previous Total War Games, because of a small map and lack of content in the campaign. Unit rosters are not large. However, modders will add units with mods, so that is not a big problem I think. Siege battles are dumbed down a lot! (do you want to destroy huge human cities with hordes of undead? Screeeew you!! You can't do that!!! - is the decision by the game developers) Building system is dumbed down even more than Attila and Rome 2 (yeah, I did not think that was possible). A limited number of factions you can play.  Conclusion: the main problems are 1) the lack of content in campaigns (including a small campaign map), 2) the siege battles are dumbed down a lot (which is really stupid), 3) Building system sucks ♥♥♥♥, 4) CA could have improved gameplay by more narrative driven campaign mechanics (for example, more quest battles).  Why not do more innovation CA? For example, make a system, where players can choose what weapons, armor, mounts and military training units should have and make people create their own special armies. For example, make it possible for players to design their own banners for their special armies. CA lacks gameplay development skillz. They had the game--development skillz once, but not anymore.",

However I have to say this game was done VERY WELL, and I found msyelf in love with all of the factions, and how they all operated differently. I also love making and playing out custom battles, and with the new monster units available the epicness of the battles are unparrelel.   Some cons to list would be- Low amount of factions, yes they have great variety in gameplay but 5 factions (4 without chaos) is a bit low. Campaign mechanics a bit more simplified then previous entrys. Chaos is DLC, even if it was free the first week. Some of the remaining major factions will likely be added as DLC as expected.

            "review_text": "I've been a long time fan of the Total War series (Played every TW game besides the original Shogun) and have been a fan of the Warhammer universe (both Fantasy and 40K). When I heard about this game I was super excited to play it as I have always wanted to see what the famous tabletop game would play out like on an up to date game (I say this because MoC was a fantastic game as well).   Please excuse anything I leave out as this is only the 2nd ever review I have done. These are in no order and are simply points that I felt compelled me the most when buying this game.  For starters I'll give let you know I'm running this on an Asus ROG G46VW Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3230M CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2601 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s) Nvidia GeForce GTX 660M 2 GB  Nothing fancy but enough to run most games from the past few year years on med to low and older games maxed out.   Something I would like to get out of the way before I continue my review is the major backlash that Sega and CA got with their pre-order nonsense. While I applaud them for giving Chaos for free to those who purchased the game within the first week, this shouldn't have even been an issue to begin with. For those familiar with Warhammer lore, Chaos is an essential part to the Fantasy and 40K universe. It would be like CA making a LoTR TW (please do so) and taking Mordor out and only allowing access to it via DLC. It is totally unacceptable to basically hold a faction that is, in my opinion, more important than Vampire Counts or even Greenskins hostage especially when footage of the faction was announced long before the game was released. I feel like a better alternative would have been the pre-order bonus being a different skin for Chaos (Ie Khorne) or a cool, non essential race like Lizardmen.   On to the game!  Graphics: This was obviously my biggest worry when purchasing this game. I already have plans on buying a new PC but knew that I couldn't wait another month or so to get this game. As far as optimization goes, for a CA game that was just released 24 hours ago, TW Warhammer is very optimized which automatically gives this game at least a 7 considering launch history. I would have problems running Attila but with Warhammer I can run medium to small scale battles on high setting with a decent framerate. The campaign map and actual maps are beautifully made and will be amazing for cinimatic videos in the near future. The units are also beautifully designed (especially Chaos).  Combat: I'm going to break this one down into several pieces to talk about the different modes as well as new features involving combat.   Siege Battles- Siege battle play out slightly different in TW Warhammer. Instead of an entire city to surround like in previous games, your units are focused on a single wall or two walls with the rest of the city sprawling out behind it. This makes for larger engagements and makes rounds feel faster and more action packed. This is both good and bad. While it does invite larger, more exciting combat, sieges, which historically could last days, months, or even years instead of minutes, feel way too short. I understand that making the entire city playable would be too much for the game but I feel like there is a simple way to counter that. After your victory at the walls and outskirts of the city, the next turn when you attack the city again it will be located deeper in the city. Having sieges broken up into, say 3 rounds of this, would make sieges feel more real and make them feel like a large city such as Middenheim would take weeks to conqour.   Air Units- If you are like me, you were nervous as to how air units would play out in TW Warhammer. It is a totally new risk that CA took on and it really paid off. Combat from air to ground is very smooth at it is super satisfying to see your Pegasus Knights charge down from the sky right into a horde of Greenskins.  Magic- Magic is another exciting feature added in TW Warhammer. You start off each round with a certain amount of points of the Winds of Magic (you can also gamble before deployment to gain or loose points). The replenishment rate is decided on the strength of the Winds of Magic in that area of the campaign map. There are several classes and subclasses of magic in the game. Some spells are your basic buffs and debuffs to give your army an edge over the enemy. Other spells can spawn violent voids of chaos and other things tolay waste to your foes. These spells are a double edged sword because you have no control over the direction of the spell and are just as likely to do more harm than good. These spells are especially exciting when playing as Chaos or the Greenskins and have little concern over the lives of your pawns. Using a fodder unit to tie up a heavily armored enemy unit and then summoning one of these spells can easily change the tide of battle.   Some Things I Would Like to See:  I am very excited that CA has allowed full modding capabilities to the community. There are already several great mods out on the Workshop to be used. One thing I would like to see either from the modding community or CA is the evolutiong of sieges as I stated above. Another feature would be the repainting of units in the game. In the tabletop version everyone loves to give their army a nice paintjob that fits their liking. While I'm sure CA already has plans to release other versions of the races (Ie Khorne and Nurgle of Chaos) it would be fun to give my current units a new look.   Verdict:  While I didn't go as in depth with this review as I wanted to, I believe that I touched almost everything I wanted to. The campaigns for each race are also very fun. Quests and items that you can collect from combat are a nice touch and help encourage players to be more aggrasive. Building/technology trees as well as diplomacy remain fairly the same with a few minor tweaks here and there. Overall I would give Total War Warhammer a 9/10. The lack of current races which will most likely be released via DLC is rather dissapointing but the inclusion of monsters, beasts, air units, lords, and magic make up for it.  ",

            "review_text": "I've played Total War games since the very first Shogun. I've seen the series expand into a wonderfully entertaining and casual wargaming series. However, the Total War games have also struggled to provide challenging AI opponents, have suffered from numerous bugs and issues that seem to persist and we all know how disastrous Rome 2 was on during launch.  So, my expectations for Warhammer were low before launch, though streamers and lets-players did give me enough hope that I ended up trying out the game myself. Turns out, this is probably CA's most solid launch in years and the gameplay is actually incredibly fun.  I wondered how CA would solve the problem of fractured Empire or the numerous dwarfen kingdoms, I expected total war and conquest but in Warhammer the diplomatic conquests and uniting kingdoms is actually a viable option! This actually makes so much more sense lore-wise and such and I love the fact that CA managed to pull off this one.  The battles? I did not play Attila, so I don't know if this was already a thing in it, but I am in love with the fact that AI is aggressively trying to flank my armies on field all the time, they love hitting me in the back or going after artillery. The unit balance is better than in tabletop for obvious reasons, yet the units, especially elite ones, certainly stand out in their effectiveness. The rock-paper-scissor mechanics also work out and make sense due to the fantasy setting The battles can get hectic because of the routing-regrouping mechanics, which makes running evenly matched battles a real challenge. It feels more challenging than other TW-games in years, even if it is a bit too chaotic to keep up with, mostly because I'm the type to zoom in and enjoy the on-going battle up close.  Siege battles are still a bit bothersome, AI isn't the greatest in defence and it's all too easy to exploit the mechanics but defending sieges can be fun. AI has also managed to surprise me by sending out flying units while playing defense, to harass my siege-artillery.  Heroes, lords and legendary lords also stand out and can really turn the tides. I love that magic was implemented, though it feels a bit lackluster most of the time. I can see the effectiveness in numbers, but I would have loved to see more longer-lasting spells and more spectacular effects go off on the field, If I enchant units with burning swords, I'd love to see their weapons really on fire!   As for the performance. Well, I'm running a four year old computer that I've upgraded with GTX 970. The game runs solid for me on ultra settings, not big FPS dips even in multi-stack battles which I hadn't expected at all.   All in all, the game is fairly solid package and I do recommend it for all Total War and Warhammer fans. I've enjoyed the game, despite my initial expectations. CA has given us a game that'll hopefully provide entertainment for a long, long time. ",

Steam Workshop has plenty of mods to fix problems you may find (including those in the Cons section!). Plenty of Free-LC coming over time. It's not Age of Sigmar. DLC policy, while expensive, is better than Attila's due to the amount of Free-LC.  Cons: Naval battles not yet implemented, even though there's not a lot of sea to do them with. AI still has issues with being cowardly, and will only attack when confident in numbers. AI agents are a constant trident in your side, rather than a thorn. You may find that many of the Legendary Lords are about the same, in terms of abilities. DLC that costs a lot, due to including one faction + one mini-campaign for said faction. Sometimes, you will receive questionable missions (Murder one of your own Lords, or attack an ally).  I will not review multiplayer, as I do not invest in that. Otherwise, this is the best Total War game since Shogun 2. It's a very high step above Rome 2 and Attila, and shows promise for future fantasy/medieval games Creative Assembly may be investing towards.",

We joked many times about how cool it would be if they did a video game in this world wwith all the armies. Years pass by, I went from Warhammar Fantasy to Warhammer 40k and also other game systems..... until one day.  The game Total War: Warhamer was released! I had mixed feelings for the game before it got released. Was afraid I was gone be disapointed or like it. Didnt want to have to high expectations... I was not displeased!",

It's the same wining Total War formula of turn based campaign action and real time battles. Plus lots of interesting new mechanics you wouldn't see in a historical game, and a lot of streamlining. Long story short, this game is amazing. It may be the best Total War yet.   Every faction provides a very different gameplay experience, and all of them are great.

Secondly I play this game using mods, many of you may not enjoy mods, especially the ones I use, the main one being Radious Total War &amp; Radious Units Pack. I will say without mods I would probably play this game less, but the addition of mods makes this game a beautiful thing, that can grow into fruition, along with any new DLC that comes along the way.   So with that being said, I thoroughly enjoy this game, it is fun, its something I had been hoping for ever since I had played the old 'Warhammer: Mark of Chaos' game, that was like a botched experiment that got my hopes up and let them down hard. This game has so much potential to grow, they're already adding more factions/units, and additional content. My hope for this game is that all the tabletop factions &amp; units from fantasy make it in, so we can truly have a 'Grand Campaign'. If you like Total War games, and Warhammer, then this game is definitely for you.      -I may edit this review later depending on the course of the game &amp; content-   ",

Its by far the most stable, balanced and interesting Total War to date with truly epic battles being played out via great revamped charges, impressive artillary, incredible magic spells and heroic Lords either taking on several units by themselves or engaging in 1 on 1 combat against other lords.  This game is incredible and the fact that it follows the Warhammer Fantasy Lore and lets you replay critical moments in their stories are great.  Update: 24/11/06 - The TW:W team have been dishing out amazing content for this game, always surprising its players with something new. From brand new features that enhance the game to unit packs which bring fresh variety battles, it has been only been getting better since its launch.

Certainly better than I expected. +Gameplay in the fights is fun and has quite a bit of learning curve. After 25 hours I've still only played Dwarves and am just starting to figure out some finer details of the combat.  Cons:  -AI agents (heroes) and the whole hero mechanic is pretty weak, you just spam it against each other hoping to wound or kill Lords and somehow AI seems to have huge advantage on this I think. Luckily there's even a mod to remove this aspect of the game, which I might consider. There really needs to be deeper mechanics to this aspect of the game, some sort of counterplay and better scaling from levels; makes no sense how some level 5 scrub can wound my level 30 high king so easily.  -Could have more story and story fights or quests.  -The whole Chaos Warrior thing costing money.  Overall, it's not a perfect game, but I'd agree with the reviews that it's 85/100 - a lot of fun and with some tweaks even better.  I also haven't suffered much from any technical difficulties. First launching of the game took loong time, but since then everything has been pretty smooth for me. I also had a few crashes, but that was probably just my failed overclocks that I fixed since.",

Free DLCs are often sent our way, even as they continue to release unit packs to flesh out the armies (which are, gameplay wise, fully optional but worth the money spent).  There are some balancing issues if you're into multiplayer - that is to say, some factions have inherently larger weaknesses than the next. That is also something that is ongoing and being patched, and slightly disappointing because some factions kind of seem handicapped.   Single player wise, it is almost everything I want to see in a large map campaign, with various units and armies with its own flavours and styles of conquest. Very entertaining and varied styles of gameplay for each faction. All in all, extremely satisfied with my purchase - been a good long while since I got so much fun I got out of a game :)",

Towers have insane range and damage, and you can only attack on one front, removing most of the strategy of the battle.

Graphics are nice, whilst they look slightly worse than attila and rome 2 IMO, they are definatly acceptable, and running on ultra on my 980ti (see profile for specs), runs generally at 60fps solid, have had a few fps dips but nothing really to mention, had no crashes and no bugs.  This is a very brief review because I want to get back to playing :P, overall I'm going to rate Total War: Warhammer (reprized check bottom). Its a nice change to see a total war game that is actually fun to play, and i look forward to future additions, oh and btw. THE AI IS NOT COMPLETELY STUPID! And if you want a quick example, during a battle where the AI attacked me and outnumberd me 10 to 1, they diliberatly fell back to await reinforcements, and then attacked in one fell swoop. I won the battle, but only because I focusd the lords, but it was damn close and a fun challange, this was on hard difficulty. I imagine the AI is much more of a challange at very hard and legendary.  Additional notes: So, after a month of playing on and off, I see some pro's and con's appearing, the first is that I've actually completed my first TW campaign! Which is amazing and towards the end on legendary I was struggling as I was at war on 3 fronts and only had a limited amount of forces of which I could send to attack/defend. However this cuts both ways, as since I completed the first playthrough I did not feel inclined to play again, so this may/not harm replayability, plus I've noticed some campaign factions have annoying features, dwarfs are a good strong race, however their grudges system IMO is completely broken, as if an ork army runs through your land, you get a grudge against them, and then you attempt to chase them down but they just keep running, taking forever to catch up to them eventually ending up feeling like a chore and a cheat.  A final point I wish to make is that mods for this game, even without some of the tools are fantastic and flesh the nations out superbly with some nations getting 20 more units, and whilst not nessesary from the core game, it adds so much more diversity and freedom, and when you look at how quick and easy it was for modders to make these units, it makes you wonder why there is such a lack of content in the game, which is why I am going to reprize my final rating of this game to a 7/10, for lazyness on CA's part.",

I think the learning curve for Total War is steep, as in many others strategy games, and with Warhammer this is not different. Maybe some people will fall in love with it in the first hour, but this is not my case.  Everything I like is here: missions/quests, loots (sort of), leveling, spending skills, amazing units and mounts! And it's Warhammer. Loved the two factions played so far, and now I'm stuck with Empire to the end of the first campaign.  If you like to manage your troops, think what to do with your armies, evolve characters and decide what to build in every city every turn this is for you, because that's well done. Sometimes you will also think about money, order/corruption (something like city happiness from civ V) and diplomacy. But at the end of the day, this game is about big real time fantasy battles, and this is where it shines.",

The series has had its up and downs throughout the year, but my initial impressions here is that they have finally done something with the AI, a weak point of the series since the transition from 2D map to 3D. It consolidates power, and takes advantage of holes in your defenses. With the need for generals to lead your army, that means you cannot defend yourself at all times. Then again, 'he who defends everything defends nothing'.  Further, for the first time in my recollection, we have an AI which will charge you whenever it detects ranged weapons in your army, rather than letting you use up all your ammunition on them running circles. It could still improve, though. Haven't seen it hold units back in reserve yet, which makes it easy to flank it.  My computer is nearly 5 years old (graphics card is 1,5y), yet load times are surprisingly short compared to previous games. Running it on High settings, which shows that the game is well optimised from what I can tell.  Colour me impressed.",

In the campaign you cant spam them because of hero limitations but in multiplayer it is very possible. I fought 3 land battles in multiplayer with 12 wight kings and suicided my lord and I won each time. In one of those battles it was 3v3 and I was fighting about half of two armys of Chaos and Greenskins and there was even a Chaos giant and Armoured trolls and only 3 of the Wight kings died. Overall Wight kings are too OP mainly because they can soak up damage with their armour and shield and their abilities that can keep them alive against massive armies. Finally I think the Wight Kings should get debuffed. Also I have been loving my time playing the game and I hope there are more units and armies to come in the future.",

Cons: No minor settlement battles (huge deal for me because it was basically the only way to win a legendary game in previous TW games). Buildings and city management are super dumbed down. Just upgrade and forget. No need to consider any other factors (food, public order, religion, growth) All buildings offer positive benefits and no negative benefits. No stances for units. decreasing stategic value. No formations, or ammo types. decreasing stategic value Seems limited friendly fire (arrows and artillery). Again, decreasing strategic value Capital city battles are no longer different. Seems only two map types with VERY simple design and no strategic entry or means of approach.  Not really that much content (dwarf, empire, vampire, orc + chaos (preorder) factions with a fairly lengthy campaign for each). Seems DLC will implement more however limiting in its current state.    Overall It feels much less strategic than previous series games. I find myself autoresolving a large amount of battles just because there is no strategy so far to truly limit casualties and maximizing enemy kia. fix and flank is really the only way to win battles effectively. Other TW games offered stances and defensive town and city battles which were paramount in winning battles against all odds. These mechanics of battle as well as others are lost and the game seem less epic and more casual.   6.7/10  ",

            "review_text": "So after playing this game for a bit, and seeing the endless whinning that the TW community has commited too, i have a couple of things to say about how this game is.  BATTLES   the battles are pretty good, it mixes things up from previous total war games. The primary diferrence atleast for me comes from the fact that they arent so much based on your tactical influence, but instead more reliant on the rock paper scissor element spiced in with how you use magic. Wheather this is a good or bad thing is up too you, but for me im okay with it as long as it doesnt affect future HISTORICAL titles. the scale of the battles also seems much larger, even though the unit sizes are generally smaller than those in the historical games, i credit this to the fact that there are units that are physically bigger, and that the setting has alot more vast locations, and wide open spaces with impressive backdrops. to my knowledge they done away with match combat animations which helps the battle flow alot better, and makes the engagements alot more fluid and dynamic. the current system they set up ressembles medieval 2, and frankly its a plus. You wont see blobbing like rome 2 at launch and things generally flow better, with the exception of certain flying units like fell bats, which tend to blob up and attack units in a giant ball formation. Calvary can be hit or miss, sometimes the charges are epic and crash right through formations really well, but other times the units stop dead in thier tracks, or only one or two go in for the charge. overall the battles are as impressive as shogun 2's, with alot more arcady elements, that would never be acceptable in the HISTORICAL titles.  Campaign  in my view this is where the game is very different from the other historical titles in the franchise, and the mode can be summed up in one word, SIMPLIFIED. correction it can be summed up in four 'SIMPLIFIED TO THE EXTREME' suprissingly though, i dont find this to be a big issue, despite the fact that for years ive wanted a total war game that has half the complexity of a game like Europa Universalis, with the awesome clashes that total war provides. the simplification comes with the fact that is essentially only one single way in which you can build up your settlements and provinces. you build military and logistical structures within the capital, and economic and social buildings in the minor settlements. this hurts the games replaybability alot and also means that if your a veteran of the franchise like me you'll never run out of money and youll spam the AI with your endless stacks of steam tanks and demigriph knights.  Verdict   now the reason that this is not such a big issue is because i understand that the game's campaign is only supplying context for the battles. now someone could easily say that the same could be said for the historical titles but thats not relevant at the moment, in my view Total War Warhammer is not a 'Total war game' its a spinoff like spartan total war was. So for me as just another game in my library i consider this a very good game which i enjoy and have no doubt that i will continue to enjoy, BUT as a total war game this game is not up to snuff. the difference is i always knew this game wouldnt be up to snuff as a proper total war game from the moment i saw that CGI announcement trailer. SO for the die hard veterans of the series, this game is supper simplified and you will be disapointed in its ammount of depth. But for new people who are looking to have a great time seeing people and orcs jab sticks into one another, this game will do just fine!",

            "review_text": "TW Warhammer is a solid, enjoyable game.   If you've played the other Total War games it's not as deep in some areas and I can see why people aren't happy about the stripping back of some features. The economic system in particular is limited. But this means fewer decisions necessary each turn and for some this is going to a positive. If you're playing this you're playing to build armies and fight battles. And the economic model here makes for much faster play.   I'd have liked more nuanced diplomacy. You are locked into pseudo racial alliances to some extent dictating territory you can claim. An attempt to mirror the good/bad dichotomy of Warhammer. They've stayed true to the original material in that sense. I'd have preferred more grey areas and flexibility here, but can see why they've taken this approach. And it largely works.  Let's talk DLCs. The DLCs here are non-essentials. We all have our threshold as to what's worth it with DLC. It's entirely subjective. In some games the DLC is unfairly holding back what should be core material you'd have expected to receive for your initial outlay. I don'th think that's the case here. I agree what I've seen so far is largely over-priced, but they are all optional extras. I haven't seen anything I'm raging they didn't include in the core game. I would like more races, and they're on the way in race and campaign packs. The price point will be the major factor for me, but again these do not detract from the game I bought being enjoyable in its own right. I generally buy DLC For flavour, to renew my interest in replaying the game later, and to support the developers.   There is enough core material here and sufficient variety in the mechanics for each race to make this a game worth replaying. In some ways it reminds me of the variety of racial mechanics in Endless Legends in that you can't win playing exactly the same way with each race. Each campaign needs a different approach.   Graphics, sound and interface mechanics are all what you'd expect. Very good. I haven't experienced any crashes or bugs either. I only have 30hrs at time of review, what can I say, I work long hours. Proportionately this is a lot of my time - more than for any other game in the last few months. I'm still trying to find time to delve back into it. I think the tactical battle interface ( similar to other TW games ) is and always has been a bit clunky, but the magic system has been integreated well and in general it does the job.   If you're a fan of Warhammer you should love this. It captures the atmosphere incredibly well and is everthing I've always envisaged a computer version of the tabletop game should be. Without the tedium of setup and rules arguing. I haven't played the tabletop games in years. So maybe I'm biased, but this provides a good way of re-engaging with that universe. I enjoy the tactical battles in TW Warhammer far more than any other recent TW game.   More importantly it's fun and not since Shogun II have I enjoyed a TW franchise game enough to go back to it again and again.",

The problems I have with this game beside almost annoyingly long load times, stem from this game being part of the Total War franchise and including City Management as an aspect of the game. So now we have a game which is like Civ but where instead of the main focus being on managing your country, it's now on micro-managing battles. This different approach makes battles intense and intelligent but the rest of the game rather dull. Unfortunately because of the length of time involved in battles, it is often much more convenient to just Auto-Resolve a battle and continue on with the game, there really is no penalty for doing so and in Co-op games it's the only way to finish the game in a reasonable time.  I have to recommend the game because it is good and fun to play but also buyers should be aware that this game has a steep learning curve, and once you are midway through the game you need to be in a super powerful position or its going to end poorly for you 20 hours later. It's great at capturing the Warhammer world and feel.  As for Expansions...overpriced by what they offer at this point...maybe it is intentional, to be like the retail mineatures?",

A fun game which doesn't require you to have any previous knowledge of the Warhammer series at all, though of course it certainly helps enhance the experience if you do.  The campaign-wise I've found it to be the most challenging and punishing of recent total war games (at least before you start snowballing.)   Through Lords and Heroes we now have very powerful avatars who are able to enhance your troops and debuff your enemies all while being absolute monsters of war in their own right.   The magic system adds a new layer to battles, although it's been toned down from release you will still find that proper use of your spells can make a massive impact on your battle performance.  I can see many people are upset about DLC pricing and the ammount of it to expect for this game. Let me just tell you that you need none of it, they will continue adding free content to the game and if you do exhaust the four main factions as well as the future ones they will be adding for ~FREE~ (Bretonnia next at time of writing) then you can enhance your experience with DLC.

            "review_text": "Alright so I've put allot of hours into this game before I finally posted a review, in order to be fair and balanced about it. Each race has their own unique feel to the game, different tatics for both battle and campaign. They've done very well at balancing out the game with their units. You play the Empire or you play the Orcs, your going to have a totally different gaming play style - it's very cool what they did here and gives replayability which was really lacking in their other Total War games.   Is it perfect? NO.... But the table top game went through EIGHT versions (updates) in the 25+ years it was out to iron out gameplay. And it still wasn't perfect either. So people need to take a serious chill pill on their reviews. Since 1990 I've played Warhammer Fantasy and the tabletop game is better now. So balancing gameplay takes time to well balance.  I have played almost all the races in the table top game and only a few units are missing from this game. CA promises to add others for free with their updates. Newest being the Blood Knights - yes tough dudes.  --- Battles are too fast I hear people cry out in other reviews. Well they are fast in the table top too - by the second round of combat on average, someone is running usually - and unlike the game here, if you break and run in the table top and are caught - you entire unit is killed. And yes if you do run in the table top and not get caught, you do usually rally to fight some more, just like the game here does.  --- Spells aren't susposed to be over-powered. They used to be in Warhammer's early days, and trust me not fun - one spell killing half your army. The Purple Sun spell used to kill whole units. AND if they did it 100% same as table top, the defender would have a chance to stop or dispel your spell castings - so be glad they didn't do that. Only miscasting now seem to be if your wizard takes damage. And they've done well to limit total amount of castings with their spell pool.  --- Magic items in TW Warhammer are pretty cool - they did a great job porting/coverting them over. There are a ton to choose from, many more they can add.  --- Then you got people complaining about the whole chaos invasion thing. Well they are taking it from the End Times book series line Games Workshop did last. YES when Chaos invaded it was 'holy crap' we are all going to die unless we band together. And yes in the book series, the Vampires allied with the Empire. In the book series, Chaos won - just to tell you how powerful their invasion was. Aldorf destroyed in the book series.  --- Yes the campaign stuff is susposed to be simple - this isn't Empire or Rome or Attila Total War (I own almost all TW titles except Attila), this is Warhammer. And Warhammer is about battles. Can they impove it? Sure - but personally I like it the way it is. You want more, then play another Total War game - go crazy with mico management in that game.  --- Is this game easy? Perhaps to some I am sure - but honestly it is NOT. I've not totally lost, but I've gotten my butt stomped plenty of times. One senario: I was playing The Empire, nine armies I got - fighting beginning Chaos invasion (Norse only) and winning sizeable. I moved three armies down to finally deal with the Vampire Counts and knock them out - then all of a sudden I got five maxed Orc armies with a Waaagh coming through Dead Pass. What do you think happened? Yep just like that, my power went 'poof' - I lost cities, armies, generals until I could bring my northern forces down. Once I lost cities, I lost income, then I lost trade - my sizeable 10k saved gold reserves gone. Takes many, many turns to build up a city/town in this game - so yes the Orcs messed me up good.  What I failed to do was help stop the Orc tide. So because I didn't help with the Orcs, they grew like the plague - almost all the Dwarves dead. And beat the snot out of me. Now in my weaken state, I got to stop the Orcs, the Vampires AND Chaos. I don't give myself good odds I win this one.  Next senario: I'm playing the Vampire Counts - kicking butt, taking names - slowly winning against The Empire, the next thing I know almost everyone declares war on me. My four Armies overwelmed by the attacks of practically everyone. You being undead means no one really likes you to begin win, trading for income almost non-exsistant. So your economy is going to be much smaller than playing the Empire or Dwarfs. So less money = less armies. I quit this game rather than face the crushing defeat I saw coming (heh).  So YES if you don't have tactics - long term tactics while playing this game, or you can get whomped in a hurry. You got to plan. To be honest, I don't remember having this happen in any other Total War game. Though I haven't beaten them all.  --- People complain that the game goes to fast, well try hiking out your army to your characters quest points instead of teleporting, that will make the game VERY interesting and longer right there. Now what do you do when your attacked and your main guy, your toughest general is ten or more turns away to help?  This game is FUN and ENJOYABLE and I'm having a blast playing it. I am happy CA did this - so much to do in this game. Allot of expansion packs to do, many more races - bigger campaign map will HAVE to happen.  So just have patience people and quit being a bunch of cry babies. You can get mods for the game if you want to fix stuff, but personally I don't have any crazy ones. Better camera, new loading screens, etc..   Thanks for reading!! I hope it helps you.",

Total War: Warhammer plays out like the other entries in the series with a strategic map where you manage finances, move armies, and promote generals; and a tactical map where you fight individual battles. There are agents for all your cloak &amp; dagger stuff, and buildings to help develop your provinces. That's about the extent of the similarities.  Warhammer gives four playable factions (five if you have access to Chaos) that are quite different from each other. The unit rosters aren't necessarily the same. Some armies (Vampire Counts in particular) have no ranged units whatsoever, while others (dwarfs) have nothing resembling cavalry. This gives a distinctly different flavor than prior games where everyone had infantry and cavalry and archers, it's just that some of them had longer spears or pointier hats or bigger shields. The factions also have different mechanics (like the Greenskin fightiness) to make them all unique. Some factions can't colonize or occupy the territories of others, though you can still invade, sack, loot, and burn their settlements to the ground. This makes for a lot of replayability.  Heroes and Lords are much more awesome in this game compared to previous ones. With the magic available in a high fantasy setting a single hero can wipe out hundreds of infantrymen by himself. That's the sort of thing prior games and their silly devotion to 'realism' would never allow. Just like heroes in other fantasy settings, Total War: Warhammer heroes can go on spiffy quests for their own phat lootz.  Both the campaign and the tactical AI are not terrible. It's hard to make a decent AI for a game with as many variables as this, but your opponents put up a good fight. If that's too lame you can always play multiplayer. There are skirmish battles available, but there's also a mod already out that let's you fight through the campaign co-op.  Lastly there are much fewer bugs than I'd expect from a Total War game. I love me some Shogun 2, but that game did kind of crash a lot. I think Warhammer crashed for me twice so far.  All in all the Creative Assembly people have outdone themselves for this game.",

            "review_text": "Increadibly weary of my once favourite franchise after Rome 2, some of Atilla's few but noticable issues, the business practises of CA (or the forced money-making schemes forced on them by Sega, more accurately) and the general lack of any real significant progress in game-design since Shogun 2, I deliberately delayed buying this game.  Approaching it with a relatively open mind, yet with the experience of playing every Total War since the first Rome, I can safely recommend this game to both Total War fans, no matter how disgruntled, and Warhammer Fantasy fans alike.  There are, in the base game, four playable faction, each a particular race. This may sound far too few, but each race is so unique in both aesthetic, management and style that I can completely understand the modest launch booster. In fact, I realised playing this game just how stale the previous TW entries have been, even ones I was very fond off. The differences between playing as Hojo and Takeda, or the Wester Roman Empire and the Picts, seem almost nonexistent compared, for example, playing the Vampire Counts and Dwarfs. The VCs field meatshield expendable zombies in the early game that can be allowed to decimate, only to raise more after each battle with their unique faction ability (the size and scope of the battle affects how many units and the types) and slowly spreading 'Vampiric Corruption' into neighbouring Provinces before a midgame explosion where, with an economy and unit recruitment system that sees a weak early game but powerful midgame, you take one human province after enough, the ground and sky growing dark and corrupted across more and more of the surrounding map, and you FEEL like some cancerous force of undeath spreading uncontrollably. No more cheap zombie and skeletons units; now you have monstrous winged undead beasts able to challenge 200 men singlehandidly and your Black Knights slaughtering their back lines en masse.  Then, the Dwarfs, who force you to turtle in their mountain regions and build your defenses against the constant hordes of Greenskins and their WAAAAGHs (basically free full army stacks), maybe taking one or few provinces until finally your economy has hit a strong enough point to give you access to devastating cannons, flamethrower and bomb dropping 'Gyrocopters' to reclaim the Southenlands from the Orks and Goblins who've you've been fending off since the start.  But then Chaos, the 'final boss' factions appears, and you discover that the North barely exists anymore; a half barren wasteland, destroyed settlement hosting Chaos Towers that spread the taint further towards your own lands. As previous enemies begin to parly due to a new affinity which is essentially a 'we don't want to see the world destroyed' common interest, you march your troops into lands you never even imagined treading on in a heroic effort to stop Chaos before the Horde's of Archeon have swelled too large.  Every new feature, for the most part, is a change for the better. A better game, a different game. Worried about how Factions can only take settlements belonging to their own or 'cousin' faction (dwarf/orks, human/VC)? Well, now you have the added game feature of a far more tactiful campaign of actually having to truly plan your expansion on a level that Atilla and Shogun 2 often ended as simply 'there's no REAL reason why i shouldn't just take this province x100'. Confederations, which is the only feature I'm still not certain how I feel about, does at least also add more addition fun gameplay:  'Ok, I can't really declare war on Zhufbar to my North, as their currently the only force preventing a full Undead outbreak due to their threat they pose to the Vampire capital. But perhaps, if I send an army to help harrase the forces of the Vampire Counts and also unite with them against the Beastmen Tribe, while also expanding my power until I finally eclipse their's, my relationship with them may get to the point where they're willing to fulling join with my empire.'  In-regars to the Chaos Warriors DLC; hmm. It IS a reasonable price, all things considered, but it is dubious that you have to pay additional money to play as a faction that already exists in the game, let alone ACTS as the final boss. However, their unique style of play, although essentially the system used for the Huns in Atilla (which existed in the base game), is worth £5.   Not sure where I stand on the issue of that particular DLC, or its quality. But I can say safely that the modular launches apparently planned that will (apparently, again) add a new map (that can be connected and played with the base map) hosting currently missing factions will be something I am happy about the prospect of buying.  I'm also suprised by how unfazed I was playing the vanilla game, compared to Rome 2. While there are plenty of mods that really do enhance the game to an amazing extent (the modding community of this game deserves HUGE credit), there's nothing added that I feel is an essential that the base game previously lacked. The only manner in which the mods, to me, reveal shortcomings in the basegame are firstly inregards to balancing (Radious etc) which help give the game a far more strategic edge (and an AI that isn't too stupid or overpowered) and ones that give the Chaos faction more playability.  Overrall, I am very happy with this game, and even more happy about the potential future of TW it teases. Colorful, immersive and increadibly enjoyable, be your interest be in the turn based campaign or the real time battles, I feel like this game is a true return to form, taking all the successful ideas in Atilla and Rome 2 (mostly the former, tho) while remedying the weak points of both.  The vanilla game, for me, is a solid 8/10. Remember; that's without adding to the score the utterly fantastic modding community, driven now not only by fanatical fans of TW but also lovers of the Warhammer tabletop game.  Would I buy full price? Yes. Would I press a friend to buy it on 25% off sale? Yes. Would I buy the DLC full price? Yes. Would I press a friend to buy the DLC on 25% off sale? No, depending on their preferences inregards to the gameplay addition each module offers.  ",

            "review_text": "Let me state up front that I have a love-hate relationship with the Total War franchise. I love Medieval 2 Total War and Rome Total War, I find them to be two of the most enjoyable games ever designed. However, Empire and the other more recent entries in the series just weren't that interesting to me. I found that they did not have enough variety, not only in simple aesthetic but in strategic and tactical options from nation to nation. Even Shogun 2 was a let down for me.   But this game, oh boy. This game changes all of that. And that is not just because I am a massive Warhammer enthusiast -- I know that's hard to believe but fortunately I have had some formal education in game design, and when I ignore the Warhammer parts of the game and think about the game mechanics themselves it's still plain to see that this entry stands head and shoulders above most others in the franchise.  That is not to say it is entirely without flaws, but one of the most important things is that this game shipped with far fewer flaws than other recent entries in the Total War series, both from technical and design perspectives. The one consistent feeling I get when I play Total Warhammer (as I call it for short), is that Creative Assembly really learned. And I mean really, really learned and applied all of their knowledge, examined and corrected almost all of their mistakes and combined all of the game mechanics they've tried throughout the franchise that were successful. It was quite heartwarming, actually, for you see I am fairly cynical -- I don't expect developers to learn from their mistakes usually. At least, not the ones that matter. But CA did that, and they went further beyond by applying all the best mechanics from the franchise in the best ways possible.  Let me start by talking about the factions. Each of the factions play completely differently. The Empire play as you would expect -- the traditional Total War experience. Occupying, sacking, or razing towns, managing public order, and additionally you can appoint your characters to Offices which give you global bonuses. Dwarves are similar, yet they're still more different from the Empire than any faction is from any other in any previous Total War game. It only gets more divergent from there.  I don't want to exhaustively go over every single faction's details, but I can give a basic example. Warriors of Chaos, for instance, can't take settlements -- they can only maintain a glorious host and bring glory to the Dark Gods by looting, maiming, killing and burning everything in their path. From what I understand, this 'Horde' mechanic was lifted from Total War Attila, and it fits the theme and army makeup of Chaos extremely well.   The Heroes and Lords definitely deserve a mention, since they're one of the biggest changes to the game. Heroes are very powerful single characters that can take on multiple melee units by themselves. They also serve as your agents on the campaign strategy map. Your generals are also Lords, which behave much like Heroes on the battlefield. Both Heroes and Lords can level up and acquire equipment (wargear); the primary difference is their purpose on the campaign strategy map. This was a big focal point for many fans of the franchise, because if done poorly, it could easily ruin the game. I'm here to tell you that there's nothing to worry about; they're done quite well. Some Legendary Lords, who are faction leaders that can't die permanently, are very powerful -- but then, they're supposed to be, and they frequently have awful drawbacks. Grimgor Ironhide, for instance, is an extremely powerful melee combatant that can take on several melee units at once, but he is a very large target -- this actually matters because it gives your archers a clearer shot over their own men's heads -- and he is not very fast. The wargear either gives a passive bonus or an active ability that can be used in-game. Sometimes it's quite significant. The ruby ring of ruin allows the wearer to cast fireball once every battle. The counter strategy for these characters depends on the individual character you're fighting. Wizards can be killed in simple melee, for instance.  As far as aesthetics, the art is pretty damn good. Vibrant colors adorn every army, and there's a variety of environments to fight on as well. Additionally, certain... environmental changes may occur during the course of your campaign. Performance is actually, pretty decent, despite what one usually expects from Total War games. And the graphics are still as good as they're known for being from the most recent entries. But really what they knocked out of the park is the game's music. There is a great variety of music depending on which faction is losing or winning a battle, which faction you're panned over on the campaign map, etc. And the tracks are absolutely excellent. Really, I can't emphasize enough that these are some of the best music tracks in video games. The voice work is kinda corny -- American accented Empire, really? -- but, as usual, Greenskins are absolutely flawless, as they've been since the original Dawn of War.  In fact, speaking of Dawn of War, I believe Dawn of War 1 was in many ways the best adaptation of Warhammer 40,000 to a computer game. Total Warhammer is like that, but for Warhammer Fantasy. And it seems like Creative Assembly means to take it all the way, adding every faction in via expansions, just like Relic did with Dawn of War. It's a great game now and it seems like it's only going to get better.",

What the others lacked in creativity (bound to history), TWW allows the player to experience a level of Total War that has never been seen before. The game plays absolutely flawlessly. The way the province system works and the overall progression of the game is remarkable. So far I have completed 3 campaigns. A Normal Dwarf, Hard Empire, Very hard Orc, and soon to be legendary vampire or chaos campaign. Because the factions are so different, the game feels great every time I load up a new campaign. If you are hesitant about TWW and are a fan of other TW games, I would highly recomend purchasing it anyways, or if money is a problem waiting for a sale. It is most definitly worth it.  Pros: Great economy/ settlement controls (certain factions are easier than others). Amazing and unique Units Great visuals and sound effects (Hellstorm rocket batteries though) Countless hours of playtime (only unique factions) Many more Cons: AI has a habit (especially chaos armies) of staying just out of range of attack every turn Ive had random crashing after multiplayer (not a problem mostly because the game is already over) 5 playable factions (although all are extremely unique and fun to play, it can be lackluster for some)  Overall I couldnt recommend this game more. It is a blast to play and the free DLC coming (most likely elves) is gonna be awsome. Great game!",

You actually have to plan out what to build where, which makes the region feel like your own. The characters level up and gain new skills and items, giving you a connection to them. Additionally the UI is a lot better layed out than in ETW, but I guess that has probably been a gradual change in all TW games.",

A great change is that the Lords and Hero\\'s (Generals and Agents) don\\'t die of old age, but stay alive as long as nobody kills them. They grow to become quite powerful at higher levels and loosing a high level Lord or Hero is a big blow to your faction.  Many core mechanics have been simplified and streamlined, making settlement management a little less micromanaging and more to-the-point.  Battles play our very differently depending what factions are fighting. Vampire Counts\\' majority of units never rout, dwarfs don\\'t have cavalry, Empire doesnt have flying units (except heroes with flying mounts), so battles have tons of variety.  The only bad thing I can think of so far is the \\'lack\\' of factions, but this is mainly because I like the game so much and just want more of it.

Pros: battles: great fantastic, truely some of the best custom battles i have played in a total war game, and the warhammer side makes them better, but i would like to see the option to vary the heros and generals, as well the ability to customise units abit. 9/10 warhammer side: the lore side they have done fantastically well, very accurate with some exceptions, but thats to be expected. 8.8/10 multiplayer: good and enjoyable, however i feel that the avatar system from shogun 2 would have perfect for it but they didn't add it, feels like a missed oppurtunity, also if they had 4 player multiplayer campaign it would be great. 7.9/10 factions: the factions really do feel unique and entertaining in both campaign and battle, which in my opinion more than makes up for the fact there are only 5 (now 6 if you have beastmen) on campaign. 8.5/10 mods: the fact that they got games workshop to allow mod support, and had been trying to for weeks in my opinion shows they do begin to care about are opinions, also saying to sega we need an extra month to work on it shows that they were determined not to give us a rome 2 launch and im happy to say look what we got the most stable total war launch in years bravo CA, bravo. 8.8/10 Cons: total war side: it is a good total war game but it feels like they focused mostly on the warhammer side, it feels less like a total war game and more of a warhammer game, i feel like they got a total war game as the base and just went up with the warhammer side when they should have gone up with both. 6.5/10 sieges: are not great you need 2 full stacks to take a city like altdorf, also the siege maps look like copy and pastes just with different visuals, of all the problems this is the one i hate the most. 5/10 campaign: i like the campaign and i feel like they did a good job, like the orcs are flawless the campaign suites them dwarfs, empire and vamps less so, also like for the empire i found myself reaching turn 100 in no time since all did for 60% of the time was just start a new building and try to have some diplomacy and then hit end turn, which in previous games i look at things and stretergise and stuff and spend like 5 minutes a turn, orcs on the plus side dont permit that since you have to fight all the time. 7/10 auto resolve: the system is terrible the thing is they have focused on making battles amazing and balanced, but the problem is you hardly ever use them on the campaign, because of the auto resolve, im on turn 130 of my empire campaign and i have litterally only done 6 battles all the other were autoresolve, and those were quest battles, its the system where 2 full stacks of gobbos will win all autoresolves, which im like wait 2 full stacks of gobbos can take a balanced elite army with units that should tear them to pieces in the battles, it makes me want the medieval 2 system, now that was a good one. 4/10 unit rosters: the unit rosters are good and dont miss much but some are missing certain key unique units. the orcs and vampires are the best by far they miss little to nothing, orcs are missing squigs and thats about it. the dwarfs and beastmen are missing some key units dwarfs mainly the rangers, people have complained about the different slayers but game and campaign wise i think its better to have just one slayer unit that specialise in killing all manner of monsters instead of seperate ones, i.e. you dont want to have troll slayers taking on giants, however they could have added veteran slayers who have two-headed great axes, and the beastmen are missing Ghorgons and the jabberslythes. the empire is missing the most by far such as empire hunters, flagelents, empire engineers, pikemen, and knightly orders like the blazing sun, the white wolf, of morr and so on, the knightly orders in a way make sense since they aren't that different except for their weapons blazing sun use swords, morr use maces, white wolfs use warhammers but thats it. some are excusable and some are not. 7/10 overall i give a 8.1/10 i in brutal honesty was hoping for a 9/10",

I have never been a fan of total war series, always found them boring, might be due to the lack of fantasy which was fixed with the warhammer universe being added. But sadly the game has many flaws, mainly the amount of turns it takes to build up a proper military force. Now the Chaos Warriors are more my type of speed with their horde mentality but they lack income and must move at such a high pace that might leave you unable to build up. Also their biggest flaw is the use of several Commanders to lay siege of large cities or attacking opposing generals with more of your own. This sadly might cause your general units to harm each other. This is by far an annoying thing to have happening. It means you must move generals close but not to close. Now I know this is based on the Warhammer chaos god eternal struggle but seeing as the Item to negate this effect is in the Tactical Boardgame they should have it in the PC game. Especially considering that you NEVER actually deploy demons only humans twisted by chaos and they are not really suffering from the eternal struggle. Perhaps a workshop mod will fix this somehow and I will find the game to be better.  Worth the Money? Not really. If it was a few bucks cheaper it would be.

But even though the campaign is difficult its still really enjoyable, which is awesome. I also tried to play with some other factions, and I have enjoyed all of them.   The only thing that feels stale about the game are the sieges. Previous Total War titles had sieges, where you sieged the whole city. In this entry you just siege one wall of the city or a corner wall. It feels less exciting and you cant really do any surprise attacks or use your ranged troops really well since the city towers shoot all the way to the edge of the map.  The chaos corruption is pretty annoying too, if you arent playing them. When the chaos forces arise, everyone gets + 1% chaos corruption (100% chaos corruption = a chaos army raises at your city) that lowers your public order. Oh yeah, and that effect is permanent.   But overall, this game is awesome and definetly my most favourite total war game. To me, this game is money well spent.",

Fun game. Love the new mechanics and just the feel of the game. Diplomacy is much better. Ai is better. Love that there is huge differences in units from each race and not all the same like in Attila and the rest of total war games.

There is a much heavier emphasis on the actual battles being played, as the simulator often takes quite high casulties.   The really interesting part of the game is figuring out how to make the various units in your army work well. For example, Trolls hit really REALLY hard, but quickly lose moral, and die quickly to arrows. Fell Bats won't kill much, but are super cheap and great for throwing at a ranged unit.   I also really enjoye the hero and lord skill trees, with each hero and lord able to be truly the linchpin of my army.  If I had one complaint, and this is minor, it's that magic doesn't feel like it has too big of an impact. I hex an enemy unit, but it doesn't have a very apparent effect, blast them, and only a few enemies die. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, except it takes your character a ton of levels before they can fully utilizes spells, for mediocre effect. Perhaps I haven't figured out quite how to use it, but magic has felt lack luster, I would rather go combat character and take a hero for magic support.  Other then that minor thing, the game is awesome!   ",

            "review_text": "This is my first total war game that i had any experience so bare in mind that this review comes from a first time  total war fan.And i can say that this game is a whole lot of fun.  First of all,the fantasy setting of the game is what really drew me into this game especially the warhammer universe.This makes the game's factions unique in their own ways and preventing them from becoming stale unlike the other historical factions from other total wars.  Now lets talk gameplay.As said before this game's factions are all unique and are not just different factions with different units with barely any change in gameplay.But total war:warhammer really nailed it with the diversity among these factions.An example of thhis diverseness can be seen by each factions interraction during the campaign.The dwarves might be defensive and confederate whith other dwarves,the greenskins meanwhile are an offensive faction which possess turmoil among other greenskin tribes.  Continuing in gameplay now lets look at the battles,one of the main functions that make total war the way it is.The battles in this game can reach varrying levels of epicness.The massive scale of battles among this game make for a great experience.A fact that can attribute to this is the hit detection among the units.I can say that hit detection is good but can certainly improve.Formations among units also break too easily making some fights a big free-for-all.But aside from these minor complaints battles in this game are won through STRATEGY and not just numbers.Tactical placement of units and micromanagement can hugely swing the tide of battle.  A subject that i would like to commend the game for is the large variety and design between units,This can be attributed to the fact that this toal war is in a fantasy setting letting the developer get more freedom in design.  My minor complaints are that shock cavalry at least in easy-normal modes are slightly op because they can easily penetrate the backline and absolutely decimate infrantry.And the diplomacy system in the game.The diplomacy system just feels unrealistic because you are just waiting to overpower other factions/tribes so that they would agree to your terms,therefore just making it kind of like a power check instead of actual diplomacy.Although it is handy during campaign,i think it could have been more developed to the point that you could win with diplomacy alone like some other strategy games do.  Conclusion: Overall,this game is a ton of blast to play and often inspires the last-turn mentality that you will experience over and over again.With tons of replayability between the different factions,amazing large scale battles,units that are imaginations gone wild,and only a few minor complaints, i can say that Total war:Warhammer is a great game that should be tried by people who are looking for epic battles between armies,the thrill of managing an empire via campaign map,and people who are hesitant to play a total war game just like i was before i played this game",

The AI are much more resonable in their offers/demands and wont try to charge you an arm and a leg every time they make a demand. Also the map is quite large with a lot of factions.

TW has always been one of my favorite game series...  Regardless, there is nothing new here. This could have more readily been a free overhaul mod/map in my own uneducated opinion, authored by anyone one of those out-there modders with super skills and time to awe us.  Upon launching the game I saw a button for managing mods and that makes me super happy.  The battles played out like any other TW game. The world map and economy is at first very strange, but after Attilla that means very little because I still cannot get myself to play that game or convince myself to understand it even though I know it must be possible.  If you are a fan you should buy it to support it and the company that creates it.  Not a fan? Wait. This is another edition that does not improve the franchise but you still might love it so wait and see what your friends and the reviews say.  Yet, on its own, it is a great game and if you want a battle-heavy strategy game then this is totally it. Total War wins all on the battlefield every time! It is possibly the next generation of TW games to bring in a new generation of gamers... maybe.  I still prefer Medieval Total War II to any other in the series. Maybe I am just old. What do you think?  It is a great game and I recommend it for any TW fan. $60 is a great price to support the developers and they deserve it. Good games aren't usually cheap.",

Diplomacy can be slightly non-existent with everyone battling each other and maybe the odd faction with one ally. Secondly, the AI seems to spam out numerous agents early in the game, which tend to swarm armies and make it difficult to move at max troop strength and attack/defend anything.

It's pretty true to the setting but you can still play it your way. It seems that the different factions all play a bit different which is a nice change from many other total war games.  Minor complaints: - Sometimes the advisor pops up. This irritates me when I can't do anything (until I remember to check the advisor-box). - Some of the battle-effects are a bit over the top. When cavalry or artillery smashes into a unit it sends the victims flying for quite some distance. While the old tabletop sometimes had some comic-like charakter, it doesn't seem to fit entirely the grim and dark world. - The world map could be a bit less comic like for my taste. Sometimes it feels more like a Kings Bounty game at times.  DLC's ? This seems to be the biggest annoyance for many people here. They want a 'Total' game with all the factions and some seem really annoyed that thats not happening. If you buy the base-game (like I did so far) you get 4 playable races. As far as I understand, all other species (that they've done so far) can appear as enemies but to play them yourself you have to get the DLC. So is it really that big of a deal ?  The base game offers enough content to be easily worth it's price. And if your favorite race comes out... well. go ahead and buy it. It isn't that expensive. You don't have to buy every race until you really want to play them yourself.  Does anyone remember the Dawn of War series ? Did people complain that the base game only offered 4 factions and you had to buy the add on and the second (standalone) add on to have access to 3 more factions (which meant that a big bunch of WH40K factions was still missing). Oddly enough people didn't complain about this. Actually most people really praised the game. So I see nothing wrong with Total War: Warhammer as it is.  Now go and smash some greenskins !",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game for newcomers to the series (Total War, that is) or Warhammer fans looking for an RTS. If you're a Total War fan and expect a new, complex strategy game with turn-based and tactical elements, then go somewhere else. Why?   All nuances of balancing buildings in settlements is entirely gone. You have a very limited scope of buildings you can manage. Managing populations has never been easier since there are essentially only one public order building, instead of multiple structures that address multiple problems. The economics have been streamlined down to essentially spamming the same building in every region unless you get a unique option and upgraded it to hell.  Managing things like food surplus, etc, is entirely gone. Essentially what we have is Total War stripped to it's bare bones.  Other problems I have are the lack of diversity in maps. Battles play out much the same: flat, uninspired landscapes. The enemy AI will either charge dumbly at you or never engage you at all. There's very little complexity for the AI which is unfortunate because the AI is mostly what you will be facing unless you opt out of single player entirely.  It's 2016 and CA can't create a competent AI. Harder difficulties equal AI that cheats, and even on normal the AI is capable of moving a great distance, sacking a city, then moving again when the player armies hvae very limited movement ranges and things such as rivers actually form obstacles for you, and only you. Instead of actually trying to flank your troops with cavalry or break specific units, the AI will march towards you in a straight line on every difficulty, attack you head on (if it opts to attack at all) and the difficulty scale merely means the AI will have armour, weapon, and morale boosts that actually make winning battles absurdly difficult when the AIs' approach is identical.   In previous Total War games you could cut an enemy army off at a river and bottle neck them on a bridge or Ford. Well, that features gone entirely from this game. Your armies placement on the actual campaign map has virtually no relevance to what sort of battlefield you will be on beyond a tileset with a new colour scheme. Fighting in the north? Here's some snow. A lot of the features that added depth to previous installments in the series are entirely gone, and this is most definitely one of them. The obstacles on the world map are obstacles solely for the Human players - AI will march further, be able to ignore the presence of most land barriers such as rivers entirely while your armies movement is slowed by least a turn. This means you'll be playing tag with AI armies such as Orks who do not settle, hoping they will decide to attack you because catching them by other means is almost impossible.  The Old World, for sure, is awfully full of slight slopes. Advertising of 'fantastical' environments that CA promised are absent in virtually almost every regard as there are no real exotic looking areas beyond the Underways (which you will spend virtually 0 time in)./  Auto-resolve is mostly the way to go. There are few instances in this game where you need to fight. Most of the time your army will be capable of easily annhilating targets.  Many of the Legendary Lords are, well, impractical to use vs their melee counterparts. I would love to play as Balthazar Gelt, but compared to Karl Franz he's trash in every way and virtually identical to any wizard hero I can recruit. Using some of these additional legendary lords feels like handicapping yourself until you can recruit their more powerful counterparts, and there's nothing unique to set them apart from the standard recruitable wizards.  Attrition is broken in some areas of the game. In the Badlands, enjoy trying to invade and fight the Ork scourge as the humans. Your armies will die within a few turns of marching unless you constantly set up camps and wait 3-4 turns to replenish a handful of men to continue your conquest. The same is true in the North or vs the Vampires. The AI is totally unaffected by any sort of attrition though, it seems, so any sort of planning on the campaign map is rendered pointless.  Diplomacy is entirely unnecessary. Agents also serve no real useful functions anymore. In previous titles, the use of Agents (now heroes) was necessary to win on the harder difficulties. In Shogun 2, a well-placed Ninja or two could save you from absolute disaster. In this game, well.. They're irrelevant. Your auto-resolve armies are nigh indestructible. As long as the RNG of the game doesn't make every faction you encounter declare war on you (I've had some of the starting factions declare war on me for no discernable reason immediately. In other games I perform the same actions and they leave me alone entirely). Not that diplomacy works at all in higher difficulties anyway until the Chaos invasion comes along about 50 turns in and virtually wipes out eveeryone you're facing. This makes playing as the Beastmen and Orkz laughably easy because most of your work is done for you by the time you've really started to gain momentum. The rest of the game turns into a lengthy mop up operation with no challenge what so ever.   Would I recommend it? Yeah, I guess I would. It has some problems, but at 172 hours and more to come when the game has more factions for me to enjoy, I've definitely got my moneys worth. As a fan of previous Total War games though the removal of all the complexity is really disappointing.Battling AI opponents is dull, Beyond being an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ there's really no extra challenge to be had in the harder difficulties beyond AI that ups the amount it cheats by than making any semi-intelligent decision beyond marching directly at you or standing on a hill until you come to it.   Desyncs still seem to be a problem in co-op campaigns (I have done more than 10 co-op campaigns). Trying new factions if you're trying to get achievements in the co-op campaigns is also pointless because winning will not grant you a completion achievement for that faction unlike any previous Total War.   The online scene from what I have experienced is mostly just noobs who I assume don't know how counters work spamming giants/pegasi or other monstrous units who then ragequit and ♥♥♥♥♥ at you when a single unit dedicated to killing those types of enemies specifically is single-handedly responsible for ruining their entire strategy.

To those who have never had the money for an actual warhammer army to play with, this is the closest we can get to the grand battles desired (at least for the moment). Take time to actually look at the details, what comes with each faction. If they play so similar, if there is no true difference; I advise those skeptics to go play previous games and come at the subject again.

            "review_text": "I freaking LOVE this game. It is not perfect by any stretch but man is combat beautiful. I have played every Total War, and I was a Warhammer player growing up. First time I saw Franz romp around on Deathclaw I literally giggled like a child. If you are a fan of strategy, this is the best Total War to date. While I have a few minor complaints, this is a HIGHLY recommended title.   One thing I personally love is they really streamlined building settlements. There arent 6 different choices for a building upgrade that offer extremely minor buffs to the overall settlement. In Warhammer each building has an obvious point, and doesnt take playing the game several times to understand exactly what building is needed where. You won't min/max perfectly without playing at least once, but its way less painful than Rome. 'Oh ♥♥♥♥ I built for mining and not industry, I guess that building was a waste of money'. Some may say it takes out strategy, but I think think min/maxing settlements was a bit too much in Rome.  The streamlining of settlements brings the game to its main point, WARRRR!!! This game is about strategy of war and the battles! Oh my lord the battles ARE SO PRETTY. Literally, my biggest fake complaint is that I don't get to watch the battles scrolled all the way in because I have to manage the units. I cannot stress enough how beautiful these battles are. Each race is absolutely unique in its style (as it should be), and it remains fairly true to its roots. A serious complaint in this game is missing important units, which they are working on.   So those units and additions to the game they are working on cost money. The biggest complaint from most other people is DLC. This is a slippery slope, but for me personally paying 10-20$ for a good bit of animation/modeling work is reasonable. I am mostly a MOBA player, and people pay 5-500$ for cosmetic items. Adding a faction to the game for 15-20$ and people freak out is absurd to me. This game is incomplete for certain, but with what is there I have already had so much fun. I personally have not purchased any DLC because I am frugal, but I don't think what they are asking for it is unreasonable.    There is some diplomacy as in other Total Wars, but for me it actually makes sense. Typically if you are an ally with some one, it won't be until you are one of the very last nations left they will start to become hostile. Other Total Wars the penatly for expanding gets too big too quick. In this Total War, for the most part the races stick together.   The only thing I HATE, as I HAVE HATED IN EVERY TOATL WAR, is the ***** * ** * * * * ** *** VASSAL SYSTEM. Thinking about this makes me rage so hard. To vassalize a nation you have to CRUSH them to literally where they CANNOT beat you. At that point you can conquer them or vassalize them. Lesson in Total War: NEVER VASSALIZE THEM. They will refuse you trade request, and when you army is far away fighting they will declare war and attack you. You can even have your army sitting at their only settlement with no protection, they will refuse the offer. When you declare war on them for being defiant, you get diplomatic penalties from every other faction in the game.....*breaks keyboard*",

Here's a nifty list of all the Pros and Cons I have with this Title. Keep in mind I am NOT familiar with WARHAMMER lore so this is in regards to Total War aspects, not WARHAMMER.  PROS: -AI are no longer dumber than a sack of rocks. -You're gonna get flanked and your gonna have a bad time. -Legendary is actually really freaking hard for once. -No playthrough is ever the same (I have beaten the game as the Empire twice on Legendary and Dwarfs once on Legendary and they were completely different each time.) -Battles don't take close to an hour anymore like Legendary Attila did. -The ability to only occupy Vampire or Human lands or Dawi and Ork territory makes it interestingly difficult. -Each races units and battlestyles are very different and fighting the Vampire Counts is a whole different animal than fighting the Dwarfs. -Legendary Lord level system is useful and not garbage like Attila. -Followers are useful and Banners give you cool stuff like Greatswords with flaming weapons.  -The gear from quests make an enormous difference in battle -The Underway is either amazing or will make you cry when a Greenskinz army pops up randomly out of the mountains. -The amazing array of skills and attributes to units is amazing. (Trolls Regenerate, Poison attacks, Flame attacks, Flying Bats ambushing you from behind with their 9999999 speed rating, and so many more.) -Chaos corruption and Vampiric corruption make both of those factions gameplay all the more fun and challenging. (Equivalent to the religions in past TW games except they buff and debuff as well as cause issues with public order) -Agents can now fight along with your lord and armies. They can support and cast magics or they can bullrush into the thick of it and slaughter entire elite units alone giving your Damage Dealers a break to choose other targets. -Pathfinding isn't gonna make you want to punch your screen anymore. -Though the unit selection is lacking for my liking, the races are all equal in power. There is no 'Superior' race at the end game. -You will lose battles more than ever before.  CONS: -What the literal ^%@# did CA do to sieges? -Agents will kill you more than enemy armies. -Success chance of agents based on their level makes late game agents almost useless. -'Unique' building chaings for the most part don't do anything all the special. -Chaos is stupid hard due to the awful replinishment rates they are stuck with. -Nobody uses combat magic because you can do more damage with the magic buffs and debuffs. -Combat magic is almost useless. -If you don't have a unit capable of running down ranged cavalry, well RIP you, enjoy running them into a corner and wasting 20 minutes of your time cornering them just to have them route before you kill them. -Autoresolving is a guarenteed win. (I try not to AR at all as it takes all the fun out of the game) -The terrain in the battles almost always seems to be one-sided. (You're army spawns in ditch, they get the highground with a 200m killzone for their artillery or vice versa. -Last but not least. What the (*&amp;^ did CA do to the sieges?   TL;DR: Game is great and different. Not at all shallow if you play on legendary. You are gonna lose more than ever due to smart AI. CA f***ed up sieges hardcore and they suck now.

            "review_text": "Is this a good game? Yes. Is it the best Total War? No. Can it be? Yes, maybe, in time.   What makes it good:   - The graphics, soundtrack, voice work and overall design of the main factions (look, rosters...) are all very good.  - The battles are fun, the new elements like monsters and magic, as well as quests, work well.  - Agents are fun to use and level up, and feel neither too powerful nor too weak (although wizards may not be entirely cost effective).  - Due to the setting of the End Times, there is a certain urgency to your early game expansion, as you know Chaos is coming, which is a great early game motivator to play agressively. However, Chaos and the End Times setting also has a major downside (more on this later). - You can now have as many armies as you want, in theory, but your upkeep goes up by a certain percentage with each new army you get. This is definitely an improvement over the previous system of a fixed maximum number of armies imo.  What holds it back: it lacks depth, and immersion.   - The devs have been talking about how rich the Warhammer lore is and how they're building (and therefore selling) the world of Warhammer piece by piece. Well, I buy this, but then I also want to see this. I want to learn about the lore, through the game. Apart from the main factions, the world and its factions aren't very developed, that is to say, 90 percent are carbon copies of the main factions. This makes exploring (read: conquering) new regions and meeting new peoples less exciting than it should be.  - The main factions' 'feel', look and rosters are unique enough to set them apart, however, their building roster is pretty much the same. So while they have a few unique features each, they're not as unique as they're made out to be. - The Chaos invasion offers the ability to have some good battles, but overall really isn't that difficult to deal with (the Huns in Attila feel like a far greater threat).  - Siege battles really just come down to 'attack this long, usually straight wall'. You basically have the choice between rushing the walls and hiding in the corner, away from the towers, while you whittle down the defenders with magic or artillery, or create a hole in the wall with your artillery / stronger units. Rushing outside with cavalry to harass the attackers is hardly an option due to the limited size of the battlefields. This takes away a lot of the epic feel large siege battles are supposed to have.  - There are no naval battles. To give you an idea, we've had naval battles in every Total War since Empire.  - There are no settlement battles, unless the settlement has walls. I like to see the village I'm trying to defend, guys. To give you an idea, we've had settlement battles since... pretty much forever.  - The autoresolver is still broken - massing weak units and autoresolving is still the way to go. The latest patch may have addressed this, but I'm not sure yet.  - One major issue is that reinforcements show up in the wrong place a lot of the time. This is particularly irritating when you're fighting Chaos, which usually keeps its stacks close together. You'll find yourself autoresolving those fights, because having your armies arrive divided and having to micro-manage so many different fronts all at once just isn't an efficient way to go about it.  - I'm no Warhammer expert, but as far as I know, the canonical ending isn't that you win and defeat Chaos... which means there's nothing in the lore for you once you've defeated Chaos. No world events, no nothing. Once Chaos is defeated, the game becomes (even more) quiet. At this point there usually also won't be anyone who's still strong enough to pose any sort of threat. This takes away the immersion once Chaos is beaten, and offers little incentive to play on to achieve long campaign victories.  - Victory objectives can get kinda silly: I had to destroy the Empire on my Greenskins campaign, and spent the last 20 turns chasing an 'army' consisting of a starving captain, a warrior priest and a battle wizard across Brettonia and then the sea. Some empire.  - The lack of depth isn't helped by the fact Chaos has essentially been cut from the game as a playable faction. - The AI does not build its elite units, likely because it does not know how to build up its settlements to get them. In the three playthroughs I've done, I haven't encountered one Arachnarok, Steam Tank, Terrorgheist or Giant aside from the quest battles or armies that spawned automatically. - The small number of factions, and the relatively short time it takes to complete the campaign, means you'll probably be 'done' with this game faster than any other Total War.  What does it need to be great (these aren't things that are necessarily 'wrong' with the game, just small things that could really make the difference between a good game and a great game. You know, attention to detail.):  - 'Minor' factions like for instance Brettonia and Kislev need to be made more unique, and playable. Brettonia is on its way to getting there, but needs a bigger roster. Kislev needs the Ice Queen, the Kossars, Winged cavalry etc. - all the things that make them feel unique. Not just to offer you more factions to play as, but also to give you greater variety in the enemies you need to fight. I'd be much more interested in the Chaos DLC if I knew I wasn't going to be fighting carbon copies of the Empire nearly all the time. - Minor human factions should have at least one unique unit which you, as the Empire, would be able to get after assimilating them - this would make uniting the provinces feel so much more rewarding. - Victory cinematics. Come on guys, show us you put some extra effort in!  - More legendary lords per faction to choose from - even if you remain limited to 2 per playthrough, this could really help the replay value of the individual campaigns. - More different character portraits, especially for the Empire. Legendary lords are nice and all, but you'd feel more connected to your other generals and heroes if they aren't the same bearded guy every time, right?   All in all I think this game is worth buying, but in its current state, due to the lack of content, I wouldn't buy it at full price.",

            "review_text": "One of the greatest fantasy real-time strategy experiences you can have at the moment. While several standard total war mechanics have been numbed down a bit (mostly on the empire management), this is offset by the addition of great hero/magic/item/levelling/etc. systems, as well as the sheer unit variety even in the basegame.   Several people are complaining about the dlc price, which I think is justified as the price is quite high (although I somewhat buy CA's arguments as to the higher-than-normal cost of developing new races). To be able to play AS as all the races when the dlc's/expansions have all come out will likely net you around 200$ (spread out over 8 years if they follow their promised 10 year plan). However, all dlc races (if maybe not the bigger planned expansions) will be added to the game to play AGAINST on the campaign map, without any need to buy them, giving the base game even more value than it had at launch. Additionally free new units have already been added and at least one free race has been promised. Don't like the dlc's? Don't buy them, and still enjoy a lot of free content (and I'm not even counting the already huge mod library).  To summarize: Recommended!  ",

Not so many playable factions at the moment but the 4 (5 if you own chaos warriors) campaigns are totally different in playstyle and lore thus giving a total difference experience and depth compare to previous titles. The game is well polished and the A.I responds pretty well. The game supports mods for those who want to try different things in the game and certaintly has the potential to grow bigger in the years to come.  There are tweaks/changes here and there that could be made in time and improve the overall experience in the campaign mode ( i.e early chaos invasion, too many agents etc) and in the custom batlles mode (change weather conditions, night/day etc). But I think the only drawback is the price. At least if you buy it from Steam. 60 euro's is a bit overpriced even if you got it on the first week of release and received the chaos warriors faction for free.  I only played the single player aspect of game so I can't really comment on the multiplayer one.  Overall I really thing its a great game and worth playing and in my opinion the best warhammer game out there.

Pretty poor choice in milking more money from the people who allow you to exist in your current jobs. Try a more honest and straightforward approach next time. Better to say a game is expensive than it is to say your getting ripped off. Considering that the ganre is more of a thinking game that is mildly rewarding after a win than it is exciting it would not be hard to simply not buy another one as the kind of stimulation from RTS games is not drug like compared to the adrenalin enducing moments of other types of games.

CA tries to gradually bring the now unsupported setting of Warhammer Fantasy into a video game form. Many eyes are upon them, both from fans of their own franchise, as well as those who were into the Warhammer Fantasy hobby or setting. This is no easy task -- the franchise existed since 1983, and went through a total of 8 editions, each brings with it retconns and introduce new units and lore. For CA to reflect both the lore and please the fans is a constant struggle for balance.  And I dare say they did quite well; unlike Warhammer: Battle March, the base game of Total War: Warhammer already features more playable units and as usual the grand campaign as is the tradition of Total War games. The game stayed close to the lore enough to not draw the ire of all but the most hardline Warhammer fans, and remaines mechanically interesting.  It is unfortunately not as complex as many of the franchise older titles in terms of Empire building; instead CA opt to focus more on the battle and perfromance aspects. The game had a much better launch then Rome 2 and runs smoother than Attila. The much more different factions encourages the players to switch to different tactics more drastically than before.  So while the game is lacking in some aspects, it's still one of the better Total War games in the franchise. If you want to try out something different from the franchise, you should definitely consider picking this one up.  ",

The combat in the game looks amazing and can be rewarding. I've played a fair amount though I certainly haven't tested everything nor have I tried to be a completionist. Strategy remains integral and magic adds a new depth to what one can do on the field, now there is more than artillery and carefully timed cavalry strikes. There is fire from the sky, giant ethereal orc gods stomping their foes and pitch black vortexes swalling men all in a very lovely setting. Most legendary lords are quite interesting with unique features and some great looks and abilities setting them apart from the generic lords. My only true qualm is the lack of love for legendary wizards. Balthasar sucks, a lot, and there's not much reason to bring any legendary wizard as your lord if you can just bring a more sturdy lord like Karl Franz rather than Balthasar. Vlad von Carstein beats taking Ghorst any day.   Overall, if anyone actually read all of this mess, I'd say the game is worth the money. Most of the DLC is worth is the price and I'd recommend it to anyone with an adequate pc. Mods change things up if it gets old and the community makes sure things are always getting added via mods and sometimes with their feedback.  P.S. Beastmen are lame. Interesting, but lame.

            "review_text": "After playing Total War for 9 years I have come up with an insanely satisfying way of enjoying the games: Preorder and redeem the bonuses (first DLC), then wait one year for it to be fixed and the DLCs to go on sale before reinstalling and actually playing it. Did it with Rome 2 and this one as well (optimisation issues).  Okay, honestly, I think the game we got on release was worth its value and all the DLC cribbing is just toxic. I myself haven't bought a single DLC yet and will wait for a sale before doing so. The DLCs just add more to an already complete world. I mean think about it: I'm a slow player, but I've already played quite a bit of all four launch factions while completing the campaign of only one - and I already have 111 hours of game time. How many games give you that for full price? I think that if I really played fast and only completed the short campaigns, I'd've finished all four campaigns in 100 hours.  Now about the game:  The Total War formula has become shallow. This is both good and bad. For me, it was heartbreaking as the complexity of the previous installments (especially Attila) was something I absolutely loved. It added challenge and depth to the gameplay beyond the churning out of armies for war. TW:W feels more like a 4X game than a true Total War game - which is fine if, like me, you enjoy RTS as well. The streamlining of the franchise honestly felt like a big 'Eff You' to the older generation of fans.  On the other hand, it has made the game accessible and easy. Also, considering how ridiculous some of the aspects and lore of the Warhammer Fantasy world are, I think it's fair if the game doesn't take itself too seriously either. Think about it, the equivalent of a Doom Diver Catapult in a historical game - does splattering people on walls actually damage them?  Another advantage of that is the avoidance of malfunctioning AI that doesn't really know how to use all the tools at its disposal. Jesus, the diplomacy screen has been basically useless in a lot of Total War games before this and a lot of people are relieved at the exclusion of faction politics - which makes sense considering that this game centres around its 'faction leaders' who are basically either longlived or immortal or their death will make their faction redundant (like Karl Franz). I myself have spent too much time staring at my family tree and making appointments and solving dilemmas to not feel quite headless in this game.  Total War is a unique franchise that combines Turn Based Strategy with Real Time battles - which is why it was perfect for Warhammer. The fantasy setting is brilliant and fun and really glorious and enjoyable (knocking a chaos giant on his ♥♥♥ with a cannon is always hilarious).  So, my final verdict would be this: Buy it if you want a fun, not too serious, funny, fantasy themed, graphically beautiful (but not specs intensive) but shallow, easy and sometimes glitchy game, then this is for you. It's more RTS rather than Grand Strategy, but it's well executed.  If you're new to the franchise - welcome. This is a brilliant game that is quite rewarding with long term effects of decisions and quite a bit more strategy than your usual RTS (I mean the army you just attack-moved to the opposite side of the map in the last battle should be available in the next one right? Instead you start with a town center and a bunch of vilagers). This is a great game to start with and I hope it will introduce you to the rest of the franchise.  But if you're a regualr Total War player, remember that they've removed the following: (relevant) Faction Politics, negative effects from buildings, strategic sieges and siege escalation (ugh, they've added pocket ladders), city maps (every city in the Old World is basically Helm's Deep), minor settlement battles, cavalry and infantry formations and stances, naval battles (which fits with the lore), individual combat animations (even for the lords and heroes), building trees (each type of building chain only progresses in one order) all depth and strategy from the campaign or battles, seasons and weather (no rain, snow, night or fog) and large maps (seriously... the battle maps are ♥♥♥♥ing tiny!) among other things. The campaign map is basically just a tabletop to move your armies around and give them reasons to fight and add modifiers to the battle terrain. What they have added though is heroes in battles (I want agents to work like this, albeit with a bodyguard, in every Total War from now), hero customisation, flying units (they're pretty cool, but bring in another host of problems - can't hide, can't take off and land at will, can't dismount), a variety of really interesting creatures that are fun to play and watch, magic (which is actually quite usefull).  Yeah, consider all that while buying, I'd rate this game 7/10  Hopefully, the next TW will either be the historical one they promised (with Attila like complexity) or if it is a Warhammer game, then it brings back some of the layers from the franchise.",

            "review_text": "What can I say? It's Warhammer! I've played many of CA's Total War games, and while some were good, some were bad.   Warhammer though, is the best by far. I won't lie though, it could be mostly due to me being biased toward Warhammer.  I've loved Warhammer for a long time and not many games come out for the lore. The last great Warhammer game (involving land battles that I've played.) was Dawn of War 1 from Relic with the 40k lore. As far as Fantasy lore goes, I'd have to say, I've never really played a game other than Shadow of the Horned Rat on the PS1.  When I first heard about Warhammer getting a Total War make over, at first I really thought, *oh boy, let's see how bad CA will mess this up.* In truth? They did a damn fine job.  If I had to pick one thing I don't like, it would be how CA keeps making the battle too short. The last few games have felt like that to me, so I always have to mod, at least the battle side of the games.  When Warhammer came out, the same thing. The battle are just too quick for my taste. Has nothing to do with how fast I can or cannot play at the game, it's only because... Come on It's Freaking WARHAMMER! I want these battles to last awhile   Simple fix, mod it. Now I can enjoy my Warhammer how I want to. Bloody and longer battles!   Waaagh! (ALso biased toward Greenskin army.)   So bottom line   If you enjoy the Warhammer Fantasy setting, give this game a try! If you're a fan of CA and their Total War games, give it a try. If you are a fan of both Warhammer and Total War, what are you waiting for? You should already have this game!  PS. DOn't pay any mind to those all upset about the DLCs. Devs got to eat and we want more armies, what better way then them make em, we buy em! They get money, I get new armies. It beats having to by the table top stuff with how much that can run you per army, then have to find someone to play with?    Warhammer getting a Total War make over , was, is, and will always be a good thing!",

Pros -AI is decent and effective -Graphics are amazing(units, campaign and battle map, all movement, individual soldiers in a unit thrown to the ground, or away and then if not dead get back up to fight some more) -Army variety for each race -Strategy variety for each race, takes some time to master -Controls are easy to learn and understand -Heroes play a somewhat important and interesting role with a decent level of variety(a bit more on that in cons) -Three paths to raise skills for each army's leader. Some variety, some smilarity between hero types and races -Races each have a unique, very important mechanism -Lots of replayability -A few minor factions have units specific to them -All spells are useful  Cons -Battles are too short -Missle troops with an arc are unable to shoot if a unit is between the missle infantry and their target -Missle troops with no arc(rifles) are mostly useless as they will not fire into melee and most of the combat is melee -For missle troops to be effective they must travel around the melee and be facing the enemy unit involved in the melee with a completel LOS -Heroes controlled by the AI at hard and further difficulty levels become a frustrating nuisance instead of an enjoyable strategy to counter.(The AI fields too many of them) -As the chosen difficulty level increases the AI is given more money and an increasing level of animosity. In other words, too simple of a way to increase difficulty. This does not make the game unejoyable at higher difficulty levels  Even at $59.99, full price, Total War: Warhammer is worth buying Particularly due to a lot of high production value games being uninspired, dull, and loaded with bugs. I had zero problems with the the game, maybe one crash/freeze. A lot of people had problems with the graphics on release, but the developers relatively quickly patched this problem. The future DLC makes this game even more enticing. I have not tried online battles vs real people yet as I have not weened myself off of pausing during battles to change orders.",

            "review_text": "Made a goblin diver commit suicide by shooting him into a steam tank. 10/10, would shoot suicide goblins again.  But seriously... as an avid Total War gamer and Warhammer player I can say this:  This IS the WARHAMMER FANTASY game you are looking for.  This IS the TOTAL WAR game you are looking for, if you didn't like the others in the series.  This IS NOT the TOTAL WAR game you are looking for, if you enjoyed titles such as Atila and Empire.  The game is great in all aspects. It is an ideal version of warhammer fantasy, beating previous attempts to capture the games charm, such as mark of chaos. Its a streamlined and simplified version of the usual total war setup, which some people may like if they couldn't get to grips with the other games. Tactics are not lacking, but are more arcade like rather than being realistic... however, the context of the game allows for it. If, however, you played Total War solely for tactical combat or Empire building, then you may be dissapointed. Traditional economy building is streamlined to the point of it being over simplified for some factions, or pointless for others as they replace it with their own unique mechanic - which is actually good. If anything it is the streamlining of things that makes the traditional economies and empire building seem boring, whilst the quirky races stand out as being new and fresh experiences.   The grand campaign is badly balanced. Having played all races on the top two difficulties I can say that they scale from easy to hard as so: Dwarfs, Orcs, Empire, Vampires, Chaos. An example being, it is almost impossible for Chaos to win seiges against fully upgraded Dwarf cities on Legendary during the end game, because they simply cannot build enough momentum with their play style to challenge the Dwarfs. Dwarfs in general do appear broken in the campaign, with the AI sometimes gravely showing your odds against them being much higher than they actually are. This leads to both auto resolve losses and impossible encounters where you simply cannot break the Dwarf army. As such a good stratergy for Chaos and Orcs is to always wipe out the Dwarfs first, as the other races are balanced fine in the campaign mode.   Each race does play differently, which is great, and there is major replayability to the game. As much as Atila? Probably not, actually, because the only race that was an actual challenge on legendary was Chaos. I wouldn't want to play the others more than on time, because the way the races go becomes predictable. With DLC coming out this should make warhammer more replayable, but as of yet the DLC which has been released (Beastmen) appears lackluster and expensive... it would have been better if a race such as wood elves would have been released, as that would have offered something 100% different to the game. As it stands Beastmen are a horde army that act slightly different to chaos, despite being chaos in the games lore, and have their own bestiary (hence the price...) Beastmen were never a popular army in tabletop, so it is a strange choice, that is also expensive for the user. I want to buy it for the experience, but... it is Beastmen...   The other dissapointing thing is that magic doesn't swing games as much as it does in the table top, apart from spells which can be used to sniper other characters. You could use your entire magic reserve and only make a slight dent in one unit, or use it all to kill a hero or lord outright. Buffs and debuffs for units also don't stack up very well because they are so short. Spells which dissrupt ranks as a feature also seem lacklustre. I don't quite understand the thinking behind how this is balanced, and whilst the spell effects feel like the table top versions, their effectiveness doesn't reflect the table top at all, apart from the sniper spells.",

I thought a time of peace has come, finally. Not until 3 turns after the wiping, the Empire has declared war again on its neighbouring factions and just formed a chain reaction among the surviving human and dwarven factions.  Please do note that this is what I think personally.  This is so far the best Total War game I have played to date. Surprisingly has great optimization compared to Attila and especially Rome 2. I can easily get 60+ fps on ultra settings both in battle and in the world map. (i5 4460 and GTX 970)  ++ Positives + Simple menu (A pro for me since the menu in Attila sometimes makes me lag)  + Great Optimization (I lag even at just high settings in Attila in the world map and depending on the battle size, might be due to the fact that this game has a smaller world map though.)  + Each race has its own unique playstyle  + Generals are customizeable both in skills and equipment ( Make your general a one man slaughtering unit, Inspire morale and ♥♥♥♥ or maybe both)  + Constructing buildings are made much more simpler and say that you're constructing some kind of barracks is that the units that can be recruited when that building is built can be hovered on so you can view details of the units. Unlike in the previous titles where it just mentions the name of the unit.  + Waiting for your next turn is fast and feels smooth ( Might be due to the fact that there isn't that many factions but whatever)  ?? Neutral  ? No family tree (I don't mind but whatever)  ? You can tick/untick the checkbox at faction select for some introduction stuff on the faction you select.  ? Got an error saying I couldn't connect to the server for a minute at release of the game but I got to play soon after that anyway   -- Negatives - AI still flocks to a single area (Nothing wrong with this really, I just disappoint myself for thinking that an AI would start moving units like a normal human would)  - You can't conquer the whole world as you can only conquer cities belonging to a certain faction depending on the faction you chose to play. You can't conquer their settlements but you can stilll declare war on them. (Though there is a mod available now that allows you to do so)  - Chaos forces appear waaay too early.

I give it an IGN/10. Too much violence.   I had to do it don't h8 D:   8/10",

Lots of other people are the same. It's pretty simple economics.

            "review_text": "So here we have a combination of two legendary titles: 'Total War' series and Warhammer Fantasy Battle.   I'm a fan of TW series since first 'Shogun' and first 'Medieval'. The best titles for me are 'Rome' and 'Medieval II' because of excellent settlement development system. Unfortunatelly this system has been completely changed in later games.  I'm also a fan of Warhammer Battle system since 5th edition with nice collection of Bretonia army.   My first impression is that this game is far from being complete. None of my favorite Warhammer nations (except for Undead/Vampires) have been included as playable factions so far (all 3 Elven factions and Bretonia - although there are mods enabling Bretonia but without proper tech tree, specific events and storyline). There is only a small part of WH world avaiable as a campaign map so far and all playable factions still lack many units and special characters. So I'm still waiting for more and more DLCs...  My general impression is that I really enjoyed playing this game (even in this incoplete stage) both as a WH and TW fan. I really felt Warhammer atmosphere and implementation of TW system here is not that bad. I've played only as Empire and Bretonia so far. The simplified settlement development system is similar to 'Shogun 2' and 'Rome II' but although I hated it in those games, I don't mind it here - WHFB is after all a tactical game, so anything on strategic (campaign) scale is a nice addition.   On tactical level this game is very similar to earlier TW titles, like 'Rome II' but with addition of fantasy beasts, magic and special (powerful) characters. On campaign level the game also reasambles its predecessors but with addition of some storyline. Also there is an important distinction in this game - factions vary A LOT in terms of strategic possibilities and gameplay. The differences are NOT just cosmetic and are much deeper than just different unit roster.  Pros: + The very fact someone actually developed this game - I had been waiting for this for many, many years. + Very good graphics and animations both on tactical and campaign scale. + Nice music. + Good Warhammer atmosphere and immersion with significant differences in gameplay experience between different factions. + As with all TW games - HUGE potential for modding (which has always been very easy with this series).  Cons: - The game needs a lot of additions to be actually complete and debugged. - Those additions will probably come in form of many expensive DLCs. - Nice music - yes, I know this was in 'pros' but honestly, 'nice' is a minimum for such game. I really expect such game to have 'EPIC' music, not just 'nice'.  I'm not putting simplified strategic options in 'cons' since this is not 'Europa Universalis', this is still a 'Total War' game and the entire series has always been very simple on strategic side.  OVERALL: This game is 'a must have' for any Warhammer Fantasy Battle fan, and a title worth considering for anyone who likes strategy games in fantasy setting.",

            "review_text": "Baby's First Total War game; the single player campaigns have nowhere near the depths of previous titles, with the strategic and management gameplay cut down to next to nothing, but they're still fun - if a lot more arcady. Co-op and versus campaigns are fun, but the two player limit holds them back from being truly special. The lack of playable factions is a real drawback, but more are being added through a mix of paid and free DLC; which is acceptable to me, as the different races do play quite distinctively.   Luckily there are mods which remove the regional occupation restrictions of the base game, and ones which unlock more factions too; which give the campaigns far more replayability. However don't expect to see any Medieval 2 style total conversion mods; the modding tools just don't support them yet.   The non-campaign multiplayer is weak; which is disappointing as they could have taken a lot from the miniature game, such as the point system, unit customisation, or army painting.   Siege battles are utterly appalling and by far the worst part of the game; they just consist of the AI running headlong at machine gun like towers, or allow the attacking player to easily cheese the AI by attacking only a small section of wall and ignoring most of the overpowered towers, they are the least interesting siege battles in the series to date, and are a major step back from the otherwise weak Total War: Attila, not to mention that there is essentially only about three variants of city with either a single straight, or a right angled, section of wall to defend/attack, with either 1 or 2 gates. Sieges are so cut back that it's not even worth going in to the specifics as it would take too long to describe.  Magic doesn't add anything meaningful to the game as it’s consistently underpowered, and just generally boring.   TL:RD Worth playing as its fun, but lacking the strategic depth, features, and elegance of the best total games; with what features it does add to the series being at best mediocre.   P.S it’s fun to see the Total War things moving around and stuff ._.  ",

            "review_text": "Total War, Warhammer is certainly both a step forwards and backwards for the Total War Series. It integrates a forward thinking uniqueness to the designing of the various factions of the game, and in so doing, creates an immersive element that hasnt really been seen in Total War before. Playing as the dwarves, for instance, it's always fun to watch the great Dwarven Citadels rise from nothing in the mountains, and to destroy the stupid greenskins who have occupied your holds, settling yet another grudge whilst doing so. Warhammer never has a bland, over arching unit or tech tree, and each race is designed to incorperate both strengths and weaknesses for players to utilize and overcome respectively. In addition, this is the first game with flying units, and they make a spectacular difference for the races that have them in combat. Furthermore, the players Generals are brought back to a 'front lines' position that they haven't been at since before Mideval II, and will cut down everything in front of them as long as you back them up with other troops.  There are a few cons to be noted though. For example, the campaigns, for the most part, are honestly somewhat short and underwhelming. 150 turns in as the dwarves and I'd burned every human settlement in the world to ashes, and reestablished the long lost Dwarven Kingdom to past the heights of it's pre-game glory. admittedly, the other campaigns are quite a bit longer, but eventually the uniqueness of the nation you play as makes it so that everything else you just have to burn to the ground. An understandable decision, and one easily fixed by mods, but annoying nonetheless. The quest system makes sense, but in honesty is rather pointless. Aside from the Chaos faction, most hero quests make you wander across the whole of the map with your best generals so that you can get the best weapons and armor equipped for them. By the time you can feesibly do this in most cases, it's rather a moot point becasue you've already killed everyone that you'd need to use a sword on. Finally, the nations of the campaign are rather limited. In previous games, the developers could select various cultures and historical nations to become availible with DLC after the initial game, but that's going to be hard to do with Warhammer. Most of the factions on the campaign map are subservient to a few factions that are already availible, with very few exceptions. There will undoubtedly be DLC to make these factions availible, but I honestly don't think I'll get the feeling of palying a brand new game with them like you might if you played the more recent Total War Games after a new DLC.  All in all, it is a good game, but not quite a great one. In honesty, it feels like they're testing concepts in this game more than anything else, which isn't something I mind in the least. My personal hope is that the Total War Devs will blend together the flying mechanic in this game with the artillery of Shogun 2 to make a decent, more modern era Total War. I'd also wager that whoever does a LoTR conversion for the game will become ridiculously popular overnight, and I will download that as soon as it comes out. I have no doubt, however, that regardless of the success of this game, Total War will continue it's forays into the fantasy realm, and I personally eargerly look to see what they do with it.",

It was annoying when they did that in Shogun 2 and Rome 2 But To have the Chaos Warriors ( A very major faction) to be available only for DLC, or free for pre-order or if you buy the game with-in the first week is really really infuriating. I don't for one second believe CA's excuse that if they don't release DLC packs they go bust. They are a multi-million dollar company owned buy a larger multi-billion dollar company. This is just pure greed and though I wish they would stop this, they are not going to any time soon.  The Graphics. I personally don't have a issue really with the graphics but when I compare the in game graphics now with the trailers, it seems that CA decided to slightly water down the graphics. They kinda look on par with Shogun 2's graphics. But like I said, I don't have a issue with it. I only mention this because some people might take issue with it. Many people complained that they had performance issues with the game. I can't say that I'm one of them. In fact out of all the total war games I own, this one played the best. And I have alot of the graphic options set to high/ultra. But I'm also got a I7 cpu and a 4gb Nvida 960. Even though CA decided to go with AMD I still get good performance.  Siege battles. The Siege battles are very limited. You only can only siege a large cityl. There are no small forts or villages you can sack. You can set the level of the tower defense and thats it. And when I say section of a city, I mean that literally. CA came up with this Idea where most of the city is outside the playable area of the level map. I read somewhere the reason for this was that having a smaller area to play in, it improved the AI. From what I could gather this seems to of paid off. The AI seems to work well enough where I didn't see it glitch out like what was known in Rome 2. I even seen it do something rather smart when It choose to order troops to abandon a battering ram in the middle of the field when it managed to break down the gates to a city using monstrous units instead.   Aside from CA being big money grubbing mizers with the day one DLC that should NOT of been DLC (Chaos faction), hopefully the future DLC will be at least worth while. I think we can expect to see Elves and Dark Elves and maybe the Skaven... and of course a Blood Pack. Also keep in mind, Total War games have always been performance hogs. I wana give people the benefit of a doubt but it to me seems more likely that the ones who claim this game is poorly optimized, probably just barely meet minimum system requirements. And as I said before I'm not even playing this game on a AMD PC and for me this game has so far been the best performer out of last 3 total war games that came out.",

This could be too simple for some veteran players.  Obviously the warhammer setting is amazing. They did a really good job and the map is wonderful to play on. The land itself changes depending on who controls it (and for how long). The undead corrupt the land and make it turn... funky. You can clense this later if you retake the lands.  Heros are neat, and sometimes they can really turn the tide of a battle by keeping a falling flank from running. Really wish you could make your own hero...

These are just minor tweeks yes but they still matter to alot of players. Go back to Rome one where you had to buy and make the ladders.

Though TW:W does not have as much unit variability, it makes up for its castle and hero systems.  Now with the mod addition, TW:W can and will definitely transform to the much awaited HoMaM reboot on this scale. Ironically 3DM was responsible for the highly acclaimed HoMaM 3 and now with more unit options, multiplayer battles/multiplayer Turn base only/multiplayer full, TW:W will eventually become the benchmark for strategy turn based executed masterfully.  Pros: - Graphics - Scale - Races variability - Heroes variability and rank and skill and mount - Mission is RISK/Civ based system against many major races Cons: - Unit variability: Unit limit 20 &lt;---this should be a choice or higher or break the units to smaller squads before merging them to armies - More story scenes when you accomplished missions, more quests that dont involve capturing but more on deploying heroes and maybe npc town regions. Warhammer has a vast lore...use it well.  This game over HoMaM series now, anyday, chess RTS at its finest!  Update Review: - As one of the earlier reviewers, I stick to recommending this game because at my time, only blood for the blood god was out. I assumed all other DLC had a fixed price that was capped at the Blood for the Blood God level but I was wrong and that made all the downvoters complaints made sense. If they don't cap it at that level or give free ones, I assume this review would not recommend it either, but for now, we'll wait and see how 3DM responds, as far as I know growing up with them, they aren't a greedy company but flourishing finally witha good game once again after a long time can make any peasant/pleb blind/naive/fearful that it won't last and therefore better to mint as much when you are going strong.   EVERY DESTROYED GAME EMPIRE HAS FALLEN TO THIS SATIRE, don't be an 8 year old kid that hasn't read any history what so ever and learn from the great companies such as the ones that have generated E-Sports, most of them are either free to play or cost half or a quarter of your asking price is and we aren't even complaining on the original price but DLCs worth another game? I mean cmon, where's the logic in that? DLC &lt;== downloadable content does not mean another game and if you think so low of your original game deserves to be barebones like it is now then you don't give credit to your creativity and therefore don't give credit to yourselves as developers and therefore don't deserve respect as game developers on any par, stick to basement developing and forget professional development, you aren't one because you don't consider yourself as one",

The only gripe I would have with this is the lack of tech and building options for some of the factions (VC and Greenskins mostly, Empire Tech Tree). But, given how limited Rome 2 was when it came out and how subsequent patches and expansions really expanded on building and tech options, I expect this will be tinkered with (read somewhere that they're adding Magic Lore Books for research in upcoming DLC/FLC).

No rivers with bridges, rocks are only for scripted battles. You fight for province secondary town in field - no walls (even if u build garrison), even no town.  - Uwfull camera - no inclination. You have to look forward. - Poor tactics for units - in TW Rome units could do phalanx, mounted archer could go Cantabrian circle, etc. Here Units do only fight. - Only 5 playable nations. I want to play for Skaelings, Kislev or Bretognian. But they dont let you. Very dissapointing. - Evil assasins - they will pursue you from the very begining. And you will have no counter meassures. Empire and dwarfs build heroes by the middle of the game and you will not be able to catch up levelling evil killers. - After initioal chellenge chaos dies too quickly  Pros - Awesome atmosphere - Nice graphics - Magic on the battle field - Diplomacy works - you should consider what your rivals approve and for makes them angry - Unique nations (dwarf grudges rule)  8/10",

            "review_text": "Okay, so from looking at the top, you'll see I recommend the game.  It's a fun game, I love the battles, I love a lot of the unique units from the normal Total War games. Steam Tanks are awesome, I love the Helblasters, and I love the epicness of watching the Empire's forces clash with the Warriors of Chaos.  That being said, there are some things I deem pretty wrong with the game  First of all, I seem to suck at battles. The auto-resolve is often better than I am. However, I still win almost every battle I fight unless incredibly outnumbered. I can just waltz my army up to the leader of the Warriors of Chaos', in a straight line, melee front, Steam tanks and Helblasters behind, taking fire from their Helcannons the whole way, and wreck their entire army, only losing one entire unit. Granted, I micromanage and pit units against what they counter, for example I will pit halberdiers against cavalry, greatswords against enemy halberdiers, etc, but it still feels just too easy even when I'm complete trash. Battles are also very short, it would be fun to have longer battles and bigger maps.  Campaign movement. I find that the AI rarely wants to ACTUALLY fight me directly, I have to corner them into it every single time. The Warriors of Chaos walked through my entire territory and did absolutely nothing because they were too busy trying to avoid fighting my armies chasing them. The AI uses hit and run tactics to burn your villages into ruins and then leave. There's no real strategy to it, they just try to cut your infrastructure out from under you. Most of them don't even capture the territory, they just turn it into a ruin. The issue with campaign movement is that the enemy can almost always move slightly further than I can, unless I'm hallucinating or something, so if I follow directly behind an enemy army they will get further and further ahead of me until they escape or I corner them using 2-3 other armies. Direct engagements are extremely rare.  Morale. While I think morale is something very good in games like this, morale is super underpowered. A couple Steam Tanks firing at a unit will break its morale in seconds. The morale system was made arbitrary for this game, units will break at full strength, walk to the edge of the map, and recover to rejoin the battle.  I love the game, the battles are still great to watch, I have a lot of fun building armies and throwing them against the hordes, but I also find it incredibly frustrating to have to chase down the parts that I love about the game. If you don't like playing chicken with an orc army for 5-8 turns trying to corner it, this probably isn't your game unless they patch the AI.",

The visuals are a treat to the eye as with every Total War game, but Total War is also known for poor optimisation and problematic FPS issues. This seems completely fixed. The game runs smoothly on my 980ti, which was a very pleasant surprise after the issues I had with Attila. Unit details are stunning and the game feels so lively thanks to the attention to detail put into everything.  The sound is some of the best I've heard in a Total War game.

I personally have a i5 4670 8Gb memory and an Ati R9 380 and works like a charm even with unlimited memory on. It shouldn't.  Cons -DLC policy -Only four default factions -You have to pay for chaos, which is a major faction -If they will honor the lore, you can expect a ton of DLCs -Enemy A.I. can be stupid sometimes   I take DLC policy more seriously than others, and i really do not care about fanboys, but i cannot give a negative review a game where you can clearly see the effort that has been given.",

Like all similar titles the sad reality is, the earlier you buy, you end up being punished for it. However if you are hanging out for a steam sale, I expect you won't be looking for any except the main game being -50% off after 12 months, and the older DLCs discounted much later than that. Then a 'Legendary Edition' will come out bundled which will probably jack everyone who already owns it.  Positives: It is fairly enjoyable in a light-hearted arcady way.   The armies are colourful and I actually enjoy zooming in and watching things go on.  Particularly with Mods, the enemy factions do things differently every game, which helps to keep the game fresh.  Negatives: The quest innovation is a bit light, and I found it tokenistic. For the horde faction, the Chaos Warriors, I found the easiest way to win the campaign was ignore them once you got upto the major battle, because you lost so much of your force it made more rational sense not to fight it, run away and hide in Bretonnia and wait for the Bird demon to get killed by Dwarves or what have you.  For a title of this budget, it still has bugs.   The maps are often quite empty in the centre, and the battles come down to a grindy battle of attrition. Compared to ETW or MIITW I found the AI has actually gone backwards.  I had a Crooked Man campaign locked up by vassalising a faction you need to defeat. This meant after 300 turns all that time was wasted as I was unable to meet the short campaign conditions.        ",

Pick it up if you're a fan of Total War/Warhammer but if you're coming from a different 4X game such as one of the many Paradox Interactive games; don't expect as indepth gameplay as Total War is esentially just that: Total war, Its a game where you control armies against armies and has very basic city managment and diplomacy. If you're just being introduced to the Total War series I'd suggest buying something like Napoleon or Shogun as they have a more welcoming price tag while still holding up in terms of gameplay and graphics.",

Each playable faction is incredibly different and yet extremely fun to play, each for their own reasons.  On the negative side of things: Vampiric corruption is far too slow, which makes playing the Vampires annoying. Chaos armies for the Varg and Skaeling are OP, and yet when you face down Chaos itself, not so much. Then the biggest complaint I've heard is the fact that you can only play a few factions: The Human Empire, The Dwarves, The Vampires, The Greenskins, and Chaos (if you got the expansion). Honestly however, I haven't felt restricted by this at all. Each is so unique that I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of every one of my campaigns with the various factions.  All-in-all, great game. VERY impressive. And, if you don't like one or more of the things listed above, there are really great mods to fix them (make vampiric corruption spread faster, more playable factions, etc.).",

DLC PRICE IS INSANE ALSO PREPARE FOR TONS MORE!  I own every Total War game, I haven't pumped enough hours in but enough to understand the differences. Basically, Total War Warhammer is a 'dumbed' down version of Total War. This game is simplified. Lots of detailed features missing. I mean lots of DETAIL. They took out destructable walls, traps, detailed empire management, formations, and quite a few other thing. However, in my opinion this is all made up because of the Warhammer units. The Warhammer units are a FANTASTIC edition to actual gameplay components. Unit statistics and variations translate well! These models are also extremely well done. Everything looks fantastic. You will not get a better looking Total War game than this. They also added spells! These spells make the game really shine. It adds a layer of depth past Spear beats Cavalry, Sword beats spear, Cavalry beats Sword, etc gameplay. Also an entire new type of unit, Monsters! Adding even further depth!  So what basically happens in this game is the campaign quality goes down but the flat out battle quality goes up. Personally I can deal with the lack of campaign detail since I have the other Total War games anyway. For me this is all about the Warhammer units. Also owning this game does not keep you from going back to the previous Total War titles, in fact it makes me go back to all of them! The changes make you appreciate what was done before and what is new. This game won't trump the other games. It is definitely a great addition to the series though.",

Top notch tactical battles: not only is the AI smart and aggressive, but having giant monsters and heroic generals on the field completely change the feel of warfare from past Total War games.  3. Fun character missions and branching storylines. 4. Each race plays very differently from the others, thereby increasing replayability. no more 'we all have the same armies just different colors' feel of past Total Wars. 5. Strategic AI is quite good, though not quite as good as in Paradox Games like Europa Universalis.  Cons:  1. Game can get somewhat frustrating when Chaos hordes arrive. You need to have played well and be ready or you're going to get crushed. 2. Lots of DLC - though to be fair, none of the DLC is required. My recommendation is to just buy the ones that truly interest you. I will say the new lords and regiments of renown do add nice flavor to a favorite faction. 3. No victory cutscenes - I know, minor quibble but victory scenes are such a staple of past Total War titles.",

But wait, not only that they have done it superbly well and made the factoins so superbly unique that no previous TW game comes near. Magic has also been added and this was obviously going to be the hardest thing to integrate but has so far been well managed and CA seem to work hard to make sure it is balanced. Graphics are really nice and the maps (both world and battle maps) look stunning with the added effect that your terrain will 'mutate' if there is too much vampiric or chaos influence in the region. Also if like me, you have no previous history/interest in Warhammer then this game really did a good job at introducing the genre to newcommers without bogging folks down in endless lore, etc. Overall a good job and CA seems to be turning their policy regarding DLC around in a good way and listening to the community.

This game is the perfect crossover that I had always dreamed of seeing and whats even better is that CA have done a great job of turning this into a really enjoyable game. Its the first non-historical Total War game and it feels like a breath of fresh air for the series. There arent as many playable factions but the factions that are here are more diverse and play quite a bit differently to each other, compared to factions in the historical titles which were largely similar but with a few different unts.  You have the human Empire faction,which is probably the most similar to the traditional TW factions in other games with a good mix of infantry,cavalry and ranged. The Dwarfs lack cavalry but have excellent ranged and strong infantry with the book of grudges being their unique feature where you have to settle grudges with other factions or suffer a penalty. The Vampire Counts lack ranged nits but can raise undead units for quick reinforcements as well as spreading Vampiric corruption on the campaign map to decrease public order in enemy provinces. And finally the Orcs who also have a decent mix of unit types bt can suffer attrition from infighting if you dont keep fighting and raiding.   The game also has hero characters and lords which can be levelled up with new abilities and equipped with weapons and armour with unique lord characters having their own quest battle story chains. Magic also makes its TW debut and is handled quite well with spell cooldowns and miscasts if you over use a spell.  Good points: - The factions feel unique enough from each other to be interesting and to offer different challenges and playstyles. There are some really fun units like flying monsters and giants for example that add more tactical options than previous TW games. - The campaign is pretty good with the Chaos incursions in the latter part of the campaign offering a challenge that can make the late campaign a lot more interesting. The quest battles are also good and give the players some useful rewards for completing them. -This game is optimized a lot better than Attila was and I love the unit and map design that really brings the Warhammer universe to life. - The heroes and lords are handled well with heroes being useful both as agents on the campaign map as well as being embedded in your armies for use in battles. The leveling system is also great and makes you really feel invested in your generals.  Bad points: - sieges still feel a bit underwhelming though they still play better than in previous TW games. - the AI has a tendency to spam agents against you and this gets pretty annoying  ",

I'll go through the good, the bad, and the ugly, because that's an easy gimmick for a review you're not going to read.  Good: the biggest unit variety in the Total War series so far allows for a more interesting battle system than ever before. It also means each of the 4 factions has a meaningfully different campaign, which gives you a lot of content for the price. The addition of magic, monsters, flying units, and heroes allows for a fresh dynamic to the series. The campaign, though streamlined, offers a reasonable challenge and is decently accessible. The writing, such as it is, is also top notch: CA's decision to poach the lead writer for White Dwarf has been totally vindicated, and the characterisation of the Warhammer Fantasy universe is near-perfect. Finally, the game is deliberately moddable, so many small annoyances are easily removed. You are buying this, in part, for access to those mods, and they're a part of the product.  Bad: AI has never been perfect in the Total War series, and it's not perfect here. There are a number of small annoyances that will become clear, and not all of them are moddable. Some of them should be addressed in patches to come, but beware. In particular, campaign AI is notorious for knowing exactly where your armies are (and therefore being impossible to engage in battle on your terms) while you are constrained by a fog of war, and its agents receive considerable and frustrating buffs compared to yours. On the battlefield, the AI has little understanding of magic's nuances (it is not a simple system) and is easily tricked into stupid positions, especially when defending. Unit pathfinding also isn't ideal, with the chasing of routing units and the flying unit pathfinding being particularly problematic.  Ugly: Concerns have been raised about the DLC structure for the game. While 'DLC for DLC' won't be released, some are concerned about the cost of new factions, among other things. It's not clear that CA is price-gouging so much as reflecting the expensive development costs, but do bear it in mind if you have a particular hankering to play a non-standard warhammer faction. As with all things Total War, everything will eventually be on sale at -75%, so don't get too agitated. In the game already, the removal of matched combat animations in most cases can make hero-on-hero fights look pretty bad, and the streamlining of campaign building mechanics can in some cases make things too simple (but still not simple enough for the AI to build it right - this can be fixed with mods).  Overall, I'd say it's very good, and please bear in mind how much modding plays a part in fixing minor grievances. It's as polished as any Total War game has ever been, and it merges two exciting franchises together in a very impressive way. The base game, whatever the DLC concerns may be, is very good value indeed.",

WFB games come and go, some better than others, but it's the story behind them that remains their greatest strength. CA has taken this concept and run with it. The entire game - though another title in the Total War series - drips with Warhammer flavor. From the specific faction mechanics to the unique army compositions I have personally enjoyed every game of TW: W I've played (even the losing ones). Artillery is a special favorite for me, I always find myself laughing when I see a Greenskin take a direct hit from a Dwarf Cannon, or an Empire line break against Goblin Doom-divers.  The terrain is beautiful, how it changes based on which faction controls it is such an interesting touch that makes the world feel more alive than a simple map. The in-battle scenery is eye catching as well. CA has done a wonderful job at capturing the magnitude of the Old World in its varied battle maps.  The only negative I have with the title is the DLC model. I can see the game being fairly expensive a year down the road, I hope (but don't expect) the price of DLCs to reduce over time to allow an easier entry for newer players years down the road. Paying their prices isn't a problem for me, but if there was any negative I had to list - this would be it.",

The only complaint I could possibly make is the DLC price, but frankly that doesn't change the quality of the game itself. Even without the Beastmen DLC Total War: Warhammer is a complete, amazing game, and it's not like their forcing anyone to buy the DLC, so I don't really understand why it seems like everyone else is complaining about the price. If it's too expensive for you to justify buying it, then don't. Wait for it to go on sale or something. It doesn't make the game worse because it's out there, so stop giving it bad reviews.

            "review_text": "An amazing game. My experience is the early part of the Orc campaign, a few large scale test battles and a solid (ongoing) coop campaign using the legendary lord start positions with both of us playing as Vamps.  I am a complete stranger to the Warhammer universe but always thought the Total War games would do well with the fantasy setting (mainly due to the scale of the possible battles).    PERFORMANCE: The game itself runs extremely smoothly for me with no hiccups. The only performance note is the loading screens seem to take a LOT longer than Rome 2 (ie comfortably over a minute) but everything outside is smooth as silk (on max or close to)  The AI turns are extremely quick (unlike the early Rome 2 days) so there is almost no waiting time between turns.   GAMEPLAY: The fantasy setting works even better than I thought it would and it appears that the Warhammer setting fits perfectly (from my uneducated in Warhammer background). The racial differences are highly significant and increase replayability several fold in comparison to previous TW titles.   While I loved the historical games; different cultures still always felt pretty similar. In this game the gameplay is completely different between races. eg: Chaos play quite similar to the Mongol horde (ie. no towns) Vampires raise dead, don’t have morale but have a 'binding' so the low morale equivalent means the army starts decaying (so if you beat a vampire army they will be pretty much 100% wiped out) Orcs can spawn AI follower armies; require ongoing war to be happy etc.  I also very much appreciate how asymmetric the battlefield is; eg. Vampires have no ranged units at all. Dwarves are almost overpowered in melee; even ranged units are solid fighters etc. These gameplay differences also affect how you execute your diplomatic strategy (or don’t at your peril). Maintaining more than one Vamp army is extremely expensive so (combined with the ability to raise dead) the strategy we are finding most effective is cunning diplomacy while consolidating resources followed by lightning strikes then reconsolidation.   DIPLOMACY: On the diplomacy note I have found more than any other TW game this has forced me to consider diplomatic actions as well as purely intermittent talks. As an example pacifying the Bloody Spearz orcs involved a few bribes and frequent diplomacy supported by raiding and sacking dwarven cities aligned to the Bloody Spearz’s current conquest aims. This worked very well and has allowed a (begrudging) working relationship.  While the above may very well have been true in earlier games, it never felt like it was needed. In previous games I have found diplomacy to be ‘spam trade agreements’, extort money/pander until you are allies. Combined with the unique racial diplomacy lines, this game manages to make diplomacy a much more interesting and indeed vital part of the game.   RPG Elements: The heroes on the battlefield are a great addition; while I didn’t really like the addition of significant General abilities in previous titles, it works quite well with the hero units in the form of spells etc. Further, the levelling mechanic also brings in quest chains at higher levels for specific equipment so that is a nice touch to add a bit more of a fantasy RPG feel to the generally familiar Total War gameplay (without negatively affecting it).   Overall this is an excellent game. I have had zero issues (apart from the initial load which took a while; due in part I understand to day one server overload) and the aesthetics of fantastical races in huge battles is perfect. If you are a fan of TW games or general fantasy strategy/RPG, definitely worth a closer look. As always, check out gameplay videos etc to make sure it is right for you but for now, I look forward to sinking a LOT more time into this!",

The armies have their own feel and behave quite differently,with their own mechanics and some unique units as well...NO MORE just swordsmen and archers.The units are quite detailed and act naturally on the battlefield with nice animations acompanied by shouts,taunts and other faction related jabber.Although I do feel that Chaos and Vampire Counts are a bit behind because of the lack of ranged units,besides sieges you can out manuver with some nice skirmish units.  Each factions starts with a choice of Lords that come with their own bonuses and starting units.These have more skills to learn than the regular heroes you can recruit,they level up faster and have quite a lot more options to customize with gear bringing some very nice PRG elements into the mix and they show because they can single handedly kill some unit groups with theirs melee prowess and spells.The spells do seem quite a bit iffy but then again I did not focus a lot on them.Also unlike normal heroes,lords will get special quests at different levels for some very special gear!  The campaign itself has quite a big map and it might feel overwelming especially when you get out of your starting zone.While taveling the map in glorious slaughter for the Empeor,the Four Gods or whatever other gods you might fancy you will run into quests and missions that some times have a timer attached to it but giving you some nice bonuses for completing them adding some spice to the overall experience.Although I don't know how it was in the previous games but besieging the cities did feel like a bit of a slow down in pacing having to construct the machinery right at the town itself while waiting a few turns to build it,making you very susceptible to assassinations and army depletion very early on.  The game does come with some first day problems,for me I had to reset my PC once and then having it crash 2 times after and starting after the 4th try and not having many problems after that,without the being offline current solution to it.I have not tried the multiplayer yet but my game does crash on refresh or when it doesn't it will certainly crash on trying to join a game.

Now I can write my final words about base game(so far didn't buy any DLC, once prices drops or on sale I might).  I like gameplay. It is true that game's UI is not as clear as it was in Shogun 2 Total war, and at first hour or two I was really ennoyed with techtrees and tactical view of map. I did really find it unclear and disturbing, but after some time I got into the game. Although tactical overview of map I don't find as pretty, graphics/animation of soldiers and heroes and huge creatures is different story. They are just soooooooo coooool :). Spell/explosions effects are just lovely. Bit upset I am with graphics of flying arrows, it could be managed better I bet but hey not everything is perfect. Now really what is total war about! The realtime battles mode/REPLAY MODE(YEAH!!!!)!!!!!!!! Its just greaaaaaaaat. I don't say AI is always smart or so, but unlike of Shogun 2, in here AI intelligence really got boosted. They can do flank attack properly most of the time, they position archers just annoyingly right most of the time, etc etc. So winning some battles doesn't really feel boring or unsuccessful. Add all these graphics effects, fires, spells and flying bodies of knocked soldiers.....athmosphere is just unreal real :D I have to say that some battles I did watched on replay mode more then one or two...or even three times! I just loved it!  One of the reason why you wanna watch replays is that you will just fall in love with these ''handcrafted'' soldiers of yours! You will wanna see them fight and die for their kingdoms and fall under pressure of calavary or huge assualts of giant monsters...and you will with proud watch them to stand up, maybe they will loose their helmets but they will not give up will just return the punch to their enemies into face or a****. HECK YEAH MY LOVELY DWARWES I DID LOVE EVERYONE OF YOU. HONOUR AND FAME FOR ALL YOU WHO DID DIE WITH HEROIC DEATH FOR YOUR MATES AND KINGDOM! I need to calm down...right. DX 12 DX 12 patch didn't work for me at first but I did scan folder option on steam, game downloaded again the patch as it was corrupted and now it runs great. My gaming computer is processor AMD FX-8300/ graphics card R9 285 2G VRam with 8GB of RAM and Windows 10. On DX 11 was getting choppy 30 fps even tho it was playable and in battlemode I got 30-40 fps, but still it was just bit unconfortable, yet settings were set to medium. Now under DX 12 its just milky smooth of 40-50 fps all the time, yet I did upper some settings to high and ultra! THANKS AMD AND SEGA FOR NICE OPTIMISATION! Will just finalise my words in pros and cons so I don't bore you and take your precious gaming time:  Pros: +Great effects in battle, beatiful ehm crafted moving creatures, soldiers, flying uglies and undeads... +DX12 optimization... this game made runnuing for me as good or even better than old Total War Shogun 2 +Battles, just battles, once more battles and REPLAYSSSSSSS. +Lovely animations of your armies, I just love this game for DWARWES, I am waiting for elves DLC to see if I will love them more xD. +lots of different looking units, just because it is WARHAMMER and its lore! +multiplayer for 2 campaign, I played with brother and kinda like that of sharing armies or helping each other. Its really nice.  Cons: -tactical/managing map is bit don't know somelikely too unclear and,it just feels so. Even tho its nice with skull mountains and similar beaties but somehow it gets lost with so much stuff going on. -after some time, especially when you forge good profitable and stabilized empire, you will find turns to be way too repeatable, especially if you for long won't get any proper and exciting fight. -too expensive DLCs, yeh I heck find it expensive for just adding so little content(wtf 17 euros for new game likely not only race lol). But I don't feel forced to buy them, so it is not as negative fact for me as for some poeple giving game negative review for DLC marketing.  -multiplayer armies battles, also this con take with reserve. I played only one battle, yet quited it as I did build balanced army for nice battle...But obviusly opposite player just spammed 70% of army to be archer cavalary :D I think you can pretty much expect that in this mode fairly often. Thats why I dont like it and dont play it. Benchmark for High settings here:         YouTube™ Video:  DX 12 benchmark: Warhammer Total War, AMD FX-8300, R9 285&nbsp;",

Battles between dragons and knights and steam tanks, who can say no to that :) OK selection of armoies currently. Battles run very smooth, much smoother battle motion and game play then prior TW titles IMO. AI is much improved over other TW titles.  Bad: Attacking cities can be quite buggy and feels unfinished (moving units into a city in some maps your units get stuck crossing walls; parts of walls that stay in place after you destroy them; lack of any small forts or towns makes all game play forced along a single wall section; etc.). Loss of weather and time of day controls from prior titles is poor. Some units do not seem balanced properly, though I suspect this will change over time. Limited modes of play / options in the battles. Lack of unit control (formations are gone from the old games, such as lose formation, etc.).  All that said, this is a ton of fun and I would recomend it to people who like TW type games and those fans of Warhammer or fantasy RTS games out there. ",

Seeing them come together was a great thing to see anyway, but I think it's interesting for players who like either (or none) of these two things as well. So far, I haven't bought any of the DLCs that cost money, as only the Chaos Warriors have a price I can bring myself to pay for a game that already cost 60€. But I understand that implementing this huge variety of mechanics for each individual faction makes it harder to just put them up for cheaper. I think this game gave the Total War games a major leap forwards, and hopefully Creative Assembly will be able to use a bunch of these entirely new features in their upcoming historic Total War game.  If you don't like Total War in General: Total War Warhammer can be as story driven as you want. There are many main- and side quests that actually give each campaign an individual touch. In that sense, it reminded me quite a bit of the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic series. Also, there is a MUCH greater variety among factions. After all, only one faction is actually humans, and dealing with the stats of non-human combatants is certainly an interesting experience.  If you don't like Warhammer Fantasy/Fantasy games in general: As mentioned above, using and fighting non-human combatants is an interesting experience, even to very experienced Total War veterans. While you can certainly rely to a high degree on your knowledge about tactics and strategies, it also gives you more space to explore and learn about the game.  If you like neither: Total War - Warhammer certainly can still fit what you look for in a strategy game. Sadly, there are not multiple ways to win (like economic or cultural victory), but besides that, it gives you a lot of freedom to play it like you want, ignoring/focusing on features you dislike/like.  Hope that helped someone.",

More dowsing a giant green fire.... sometimes with petrol. I have restarted battles about 100(0) times, trying my best to squeeze out a slightly better outcome. I'm drained! (in a good way).   I played some of the other games in the total war series and never felt this connected to an army. Each individual lords items and abilties makes me bond a little to them. I will retry and retry to save them in battle to keep them on their fighting path.   The graphics are superb! However, unless you pause, you never really get to apreciate them. If you do take time to watch the great animation, your probaly miss a stumpy legged unit chasing down a band of orc archers... until they are an even smaller dot on the horizon.  I run a i5, R9 290 trix (slightly OC'ed), and a 1440 monitor. On ultra, I am not getting the fastest FPS (about 30-45) but I never felt like it I needed 'more frames'. Yes 30 -45 isnt great, but with the pace of the game It never felt lacking.  The AI isnt stupid, I have set up a couple of bottle neck or killing pit, only to find myself being out flanked by riders. The only complaint I have about the opposing army is the way that units can just appear. 'Hidden armies' can pop up in the middle of a battlefield or at the base of a hill and no really reason why my units didnt spot them... unless their helmets had slipped down over thier eyes.  All in all, even after 15 hours I havn't really stretched my armies undeveloped legs.. other than to have them running from one settlement to another trying to quash the green scum.    Is it a hard slog, yes... is it worth it? At the moment yes, but i'll update you in another 43 turns.   Finally, If you have a beard play as the Dwarves    ",

So i am only going to tell you what i as an great Total War fan think of it!  Bad things first. The campaign is in many ways horrific. The AI only recruits Missile units like Bow Riders and stacks them up. If you want to fight those battles in RTS it is just a pain in the A** . A few more different starting positions would have been nice, too.  GOOD Things + Awesome Fantasy Setting + extremly different Units + bad ♥♥♥ magic abilitys and really useful Generals (Lords) + Good Graphics and good performing (works just fine on my Nvidea 850M Notebook grafics) + as always Mindblowing RTS Battles + STEAM WORKSHOP   Everything that you do not like about this game, do not worry!! A brilliant guy who has too much freetime will fix it for you in the Steam Workshop an uplod it for free! There are already tons of Mods in the Workshop after just a short time after release.  Game overhauls, improvments, balancing and also Cheats, if you just want to conquer this huge wonderful world without ever worrying about such wordly uninteresting things as economy!!  I recommend this Game to every Total War or Warhammer fan. It is great, it will be getting even greater and the small bad things are just like bugs that will be fixed by the great community.",

The only disappointment that I find here are that more units should have been in the game, there is not much to choose, but we are lucky that we can download mods from the Workshop ( for example, the Radious Mod adds tons of new units so with that mod the game is really fun and of course there are other mods that you can download to make the game you want it to be ), and the overpriced ,, Call Of The Bestmen' and ,,The Realm Of The Wood Elves' DLC. I can accept if the DLC is 7.50 euros or lower, but for 17.50 euros, go to HELL, I already gave you 60 euros !!! FFS Sega stop it -.-   But despite those two things, the game is really good and I can recommend it to all total war fans and especially to ones who love Warhammer fantasy. And also, one advice, if you are that kind of a person that can wait for a sale and if 60 euros is too much for you, then wait for it so that you can maybe even buy yourself a DLC at the same time, then I can promise you that you will get your money really worth for this game and you will be more then happy !

It really is possible to win these games via alliance building, agressive expansion, or whatever else in between.   I would suggest a new player to play Humans or Greenskins first. Good starting position and easily defendable castles for humans and WAHHHs for Orcs.   Chaos is only for aggressive expansion where you are attacking a city every couple turns just to maintain your armies. Their units are by far the best in the game, their heroes are not so great in balance. The generals are great, but slow.   Vampires are tricky in their vampire corruption mechanic. It helps to know the map before playing the vamps. Their units and terror abilities are a blast. It's always a flat out charge with them in battle too becuase they have no ranged weps.   Global recruitment is amazing. They made a lot of good improvements to the AI. Some of the long time tricks in the game still work, they are just far less efficent and no longer the best option in a battle  They need to add an undo move button. My dwarf campaign would crash after turn 110. Last save was like turn 85. I just abandoned that campaign and never finished the dwarves.",

            "review_text": "Unlike other Total War games, where gameplay innovations must outshine the stunning lack of diversity and effort put into the core armies and factions themselves, Total War: Warhammer starts with a good unit roster and a very good core campaign. The game overall runs well, looks nice, and does capture the Warhammer feel. However, it's not without it's problems. First and foremost: the game, since some actual work had to be put into the different armies and factions this time, has an incredibly small unit roster to choose from, and are missing some very important types of soldiers in the  Warhammer lore, such as the Blood Knights for the Vampire faction, and the Questing knights for Bretonnia. At this point, I would even say that I have more units from mods than from the vanilla game (although the community appears only to be interested in making more of the same units for the Empire, which is dissapointing at the very least). Second, and one of the issues that there was so much fuss about, is that CA (those absolute imbeciles) cut out a core race from the game to sell as DLC - the Chaos. Now normally, I can understand when some things are cut out of a game to sell as DLC. Developers are people, and people need to eat. However their choice in cutting out Chaos was a mistake. They could have chosen the Dwarves or the Vampire Knights or Bretonnia to cut out - all three of which the game would be semi-complete without - and it wouldn't have been nearly as much of a bother.   I just realized how lengthy this review was getting, so I'll cut to the chase.  Pros: +Unit diversity +Good graphics +Nice, rounded campaign +Good incorporation of the Warhammer universe +Epic, large battles +Nice environmental diversity  Cons: -Lack of units -Lack of factions -Odd gameply decisions (seemingly limited to the campaign, at least) -Incomplete factions/unit rosters -Poor DLC decisions -Battles are way too fast  Overall: A solid 3/5.  Not outstanding, but certainly fun. I would recommend the Chaos DLC solely because the game just isn't complete until you've played as the Chaos.",

All the different races provide unique mechanics and gameplay styles, especially compared to the more copy paste factions of past installments.  While some of the negative reviews say the game is broken down in to micro transactions, I believe that is inacurate. CA has released several heros and units for free already, and is going to release the bretonnia faction for free come febuary. In addition, each race pack adds a fully fleshed out race to the game (Maybe barring the Chaos dlc, it is rather tedious.) Overall I've gotten way more than my moneys worth with Warhammer Total war, and would consider it my game of the year. 10/10 would fire rocket batteries in to hordes of greenskins again.",

            "review_text": "Comparing myself to other Total War fans and players I seem to have a different point of view than most. For reasons I don't understand the Shogun games were rated higher than the Medieval 2 game - I suppose there are features and details taken into account that I do not.  I despise Shogun, there's absolutely nothing dynamic about it and no reason to play it a second time(in my opinion) because all the factions are the same. They all have the same units.  Medieval 2 I still play to this day. Why? Not for graphics or it's potential(even with an i7 quad core, the game still won't bring in extra armies stating I need a better processor), but it's because of the dynamic qualities of the game. The Scottish are -nothing- like the Moores, for example.  If you're like me and you enjoy the dynamic, varied qualities of the different factions and countries and you happen to be a fan of the base fantasy archetypes created by Tolkien then you might enjoy Warhammer as much as I do.  The game is more individually centered, meaning individual soldiers or heroes tend to have a huge influence, opposed to the semi-historical games opposed where you are much better off protecting your general than sending him in on the front lines. So, tactics and strategy will require adjusting, but I admit, as a fan of the fantasy genre and of Total War in general, I absolutely adore Total War Warhammer.  For example, the 'Greenskins' are essentially the armies of Mordor, as we know it from Lord of the Rings. They share much more in common than they are different. In fact, you'll find those archetypes(like the ring wraiths or Aragorn's undead army, the dwarf factions, etc) are all over the game and are so similar that it has given me pause at times wondering how it isn't a copyright issue.  It's a visually cinematic game. I find myself watching the fights more than actually leading sometimes, just because it's so cool watching a giant vampire monster smash through a company of soldiers for example. And it's replayability is very high, elements of randomness mixed with what is no less thn 50+ starting factions(of all races), some of them friendly and others not-so-friendly. So, it's not as if the -only- human faction you will face is 'The Empire' only, there are a number of other factions that can potentially grow to a major power.  The game is also very 'smash mouth' compared to other Total War games. Depending on the units, many of them are super heroes basically and will sustain a fight where anything short of, say in Medieval 2 terms dismounted Fuedal Knights, would break the fight and run. So there are a lot of very powerful, sometimes individual units instead of large companies.  There are some cons though.   I would prefer the seige battles were a little less airy, meaning it's very easy, compared to other titles, to attack a city and win.  The defending side no longer will flee to the center of town either, there are avenues of escape surrounding the battle map, so a unit could 'run away' back into the city and take itself out of the fight.  Apart from that? It's the first Fantasy Total War game and it's fantastic.  There may be some balancing issues as well. A 'full' army of humans will never equal a 'full' army of undead, for example. The Vampire Lords have too many very powerful units. But this is offset as the Vampire Lords armies are very expensive and so there will naturally be far less of them than other factions. If I were going to fight a 'full' Vampire Lords army it would need to be with at least 2 human armies, complete with plenty of cannon and ranged and it's better defensive units... and hopefully a good leader and spell caster.  Thus far in my short time playing, I have yet to lose a fight with the Vampire Lords, much less than that, I have yet to lose a single Terrorgeist(bone dragon basically) or Varghulf(sp? giant vampire monster). They are very powerful and I essentially use them as pivot points to allow the smaller units to engage and weaker, faster units to flank.  I love the Total War games, with the exception of a few titles(as they lack the dynamic qualities of others) and Warhammer is probably my favorite of them all. If this is your first Total War game, I recommend trying Medieval 2 first, it's cheap and still very good(also playable on much older pc's, my dual core laptop can run it).  10/10",

Rating&amp;Opinion   Total War: Warhammer is a really fun and great game, ever since I heard of it I have been wanting to get it! I have played this game for about 91 hours but hoping to add 909 more! I am also a HUGE total war fan and have played most of the games. but the reason you are reading is for my rating yes...I would give it a   8/10   now you might be wondering for this rating but this game leans more into the medieval 2 style of gameplay now I am sure lots of people like this but I have mixed views which I shall express later on in my review.    Gameplay  Now this is the most important part of the review, so this also matters should you purchase this game. because this is such a big part I will make it into smaller sections   Playable Races&amp;Factions  Non-dlc races   The Empire-Led on his fearsome mount:Deathclaw, Emperor Karl Franz leads the armies of the Empire to glorious victory against Vampire,Orks,Chaos and Beastmen! Having a very balanced army roster I am enjoying my campaign with them so far.  The Dwarves-My favorite little stunties, The High King Thorgrim GrudgeBearer leads the charge to take back lost holds and unite the Dwarves under one banner! The Dwarves have a very nice defensive roster with devastating units you will have trouble defeating the Greenskins as they get big quite fast, Playing as the Dwarves can be challenging as with no calvary you often can't run down troops nor block the enemy's.   I have a challenge for you   Playing as the Dwarves you must be cautious and try to win heroic or decisive victorys as every Dwarf life matters with the Longbeards outnumbering the Beardlings     The Greenskins-What a great campaign one of the best always on your feet being at war with someone, the end times just arrived word of advice, do not read spoiler: When the end times happens 4 full stacks will appear in the southern badlands so be ready to deal with chaos Okay back... in my current campaign everyone got the shield of civilization...except the orks, but I decided to make peace with everyone to take my 5 full stacks and attack chaos cuz its Grimgor Ironhide job to 'smash eads an crake skullz'  Vampire counts-I have not decided to play them yet as I find them a bit boring, sorry :(   Dlc Factions   Chaos-I vow on the chaos gods I shall not play it until I get the Blood &amp; Gore dlc, and then finally I will only play it on Legendary.  Beastmen-I will not be getting the Beastmen as there not a faction that interest me and $21 cad is a bit to high for me    Possible future factions  Chaos Dwarves-Lets be honest Dwarfs mixed with Chaos, I'm sorry please tell how thats not awesome, read some of the lore there cruel and love slavery (oh wait some people might get triggered) They actually build some crazy weapons look it up.  Skaven-There Rats and there Rats that kinda resemble a man, Oh course this is your chance to be that knight in shinning Armour to swoon that girl you fancy.  Tomb Kings Expedition-Think about it Settra leads a expedition into the old world can either be a advanced horde or occupy Ork cities and Dwarf Karaks    Battles&amp;Sieges  Earlier in this review I said 'Warhammer leans into medieval 2' that means less skill is needed to play the game as the main tactic I see is, Hammer and Anvil. With the loss of: Shield wall,Heavy, fire,normal arrows, etc, I find this to be less skillful and easier for newer players  Battles can take place out in the open or in cities, I have to say open battles are fun and exciting but Sieges are rather dissapointing and short with lack of planning to make a mighty last stand of the Dwarves against a horde of Orks but resorts to just put your troops on the walls and see who wins. (fix to sieges have a ♥♥♥♥ computer and battles will last hours even on triple speed )I would say the AI has improved but still prone to stupid decisions.     Replayability  With currently 6 factions (including dlc) there are many options for Replayability and with more to be added there is always hopefully something new    Running out of ideas so just read my very long and pointless sentence about my talking about how pointless it is   Now that this is over (guys don't worry I will update this )    Lead mighty armies of the Empire to victory! Capture lost Karaks and reclaim the lost honour of the Dwarves! Raise hundreds of long dead warriors to attack and become the rightful rulers of the Empire! Sound the battle horns of the beastmen and spread Chaos upon those that uphold law and order! Conquer the whole world as Archaon the Everchosen with the end times and countless Norscans and Daemons or you can just 'smash eads an crake skullz' with Grimgor Ironhide!        ",

That said, the game runs with no issues once it gets loaded, which is a little slower than Rome 2 to load but still faster than Shogun 2 to load, which had the longest load time I can recall on any TW game.  Total War Fans: This game is great, it really is. Agents can now fight when embedded into an army, lesser towns can have walls but don't have to have, the Campaing AI is -ok- if a touch slow while the battle AI is -very good- actually flanking with cavalry and supporting their archers. You cannot garrison cities without leaving a general in that city, which can make managing public order a little harder than it has to be, but it isn't terrible. There are faction specific movies again, which is nice. All in all this is a very solid Total War game. OH! and you can rename cities and heroes. Pretty nifty.  Warhammer Fans: This game brings the races and creatures to life in a beautiful way. I honestly cannot wait for, and truly hope for, a blood and gore DLC to really bring home the Hammer, but even without it its fun to watch the fights. Units are well balanced and keep much of their flavor. Flying units exist, giants and monsters, even magic and mech. There are quests for legendary lords and loads of lore for those who want it.  I only have ~40 hours in at this point (compared to ~500 in Rome 2) but I can already tell you this is going to be one of my favorite games for quite a long time.",

The game on its own if great for the price and you dont even need to buy the dlc if you dont want it, its more for if you want the extra stuff, the game on its own was enough to keep me happy for days.

The graphics are great - watching a monster throwing humans around like bean bags as they desperately try to flee a routed encounter is priceless. The strategy is pretty deep as well - there's the map-level turn-based HoMM/AOW-style strategy, and then there's the large scale RTS of combat encounters.  It's not perfect - but it was a super clean relatively bugless launch, and some of the quirks (Invocation of Nehek seeming to do nothing) were promptly fixed in the first patch. I 'get it' with the anger over the DLC, but the content in the base game is extensive and great, the factions are logical, and importantly, they inherent the very distinct strengths and weaknesses of their tabletop counterparts! The factions ARE distinct in this. It is VERY meaningful to the strategies you use (as a whole, and on an encounter-by-encounter basis depending on the opposing team you are up against).  I highly recommend it",

            "review_text": "So I don't really like CA or their business practices. It is a pretty sketchy deal they run: 'Here is our new game, immediately with this DLC faction! One month later, pay a few dollars and add lack luster blood graphics to the game. Then we will have another fresh DLC for you to buy, etc, etc.' At least with Warhammer, the DLC will be a little more unique than asking players to pay for factions already in the game (maybe, not sure what is happening with Bretonnia).  That said, the extra expenses and balance issues in multiplayer do re-create the Games Workshop table top experience. At least I am staying in my depth as a long time GW customer.  But even after all that saltiness and angry net growling, I can't help but really enjoy this game. It is a lot of fun.   Most of my bitterness comes from the knowledge that I am going to pay for the stupid blood pack (well, maybe. It doesn't look that good) and probably every other race DLC because the game is fun and this is the best Total War game in years. The races play unique from one another and, despite much of the complaining, having certain factions not be able to take other factions' territories makes diplomacy a lot more valid and helps combat the everyone invades everyone problem. The civilized races uniting against Chaos incursions in the campaign adds focus and narrative and the addition of magic, which needs some balancing (giant, high cost fire/death tornadoes that are difficult to aim do pitiful damage even when they connect, while cheaper, target and forget spells decimate heroes and entire units), works really well in these big battles.  So come ready to spend some money and you should find an enjoyable experience if you like either Total War games of the past or the Warhammer Fantasy Universe.",

            "review_text": "After playing for about 100 hours i think it is time for me to give this game an honest review.  This just might be one of the greatest Total War game i have ever had the honor of playing. The game runs like silk and only lags in huge 3v3 battles and even then it is very little. The models and textures are absolutely gorgeous on Ultra and great on High. The gameplay is like other Total War games but with a few twist. Now you have to worry about HUGE beast ripping through your lines and even better, flying creatures. Now, I was very skeptical when I learned about flying things. I wondered if CA would be able to pull it of and I was blown away when a verghiest landed and quickly decimated belthasar gelt. Right there I knew that this was one of the greats that would insta go into my favorites. There are so many good things about this game but I do have a few complaints.  Day one i had trouble even running the game but of course it was fixed in around 10 mins. Other than that i could not seem to find any other glitches or bugs and still have found none. Now on to my complaints on the game at the moment. Chaos is my absolute favorite nation to play as but boy is it infuriating. around turn 20 i had around 13-16 full stacks chasing me around the map. It wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't nations on the oither side of the map leaving their borders to attack my 2 stacks. I dont mind having to fight 2v5 if the 5 is the people closest to me not the empire and its allies leaving their borders unprotected to chase me. After i escapes and dominated the north i went to the empire and found that all of their cities excluding their capital was under britonias control. (Surprise!) The other semi complaint is the diplomacy. I dont know how to feel about it. It is imposible to do anything unless you give 30k-40k. If i offer the ai a trade agreement where they will make 300 a turn and i will make 84 and offer them 10k they should not say no and then declare war on me. My last one is that the orcs need better early game units. They seem to get stomped by the dwarfs every game only surviving by confederatin with others and being everywhere. I know dwarfs should be able to 1v3 orc units and agree with it I do beleive that the orcs are a little too weak early on. A potential fix may be to give them bolt throwers? That is about it for my review. I would recomend this game to anyone who loves Warhammer or Total War. 11/10",

If you do not have any past experience with Total War games, you might struggle in certain battle situations, I would recommend trying the older ones if you are stuck somehwere and need tactical assistance. The Balance of Power spectrum does not reflect upon the army composition, it's more reflecting upon the Hero's levels and skills, so do not forfeit one match which might slighty balance more to the power of the agressor, these battles are what make and break this game!

Also the fact that each faction have different mechanics makes that even better. This also makes playing each faction feels rewarding, as you will need different strategy each time.  Another great thing is the immersion. I’m more of a WARHAMMER 40k guy, but man the way the designed the map, the attention to detail makes the game very immersive. I’m currently doing a dwarf campaign and it feels amazing to go through mountains to kill those pesky greenskins. Love the unit design and their artillery.

Luckily though, my fears were unfounded as this was a phenominally well made game and it even ended the story of Warhammer the way it should have. While Shogun 2 remains my favorite because of its province/economics/seasons system, this game was absolutely fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a complex and challenging game. 9.75/10",

Also lack of campaign map as it seems very small but not a heavy issue as gameplay made up for it. Also lack of fractions but im sure will be avaible in upcoming dlcs still costing the player more capital but over all an 8/10 and worth the buy if your willing to spend afterwards aswell",

And when they announced Total War: WARHAMMER, I was hyped. Big fan of the Warhammer Fantasy Scene, and when two of my favorite games mold to make one. Makes me a pretty happy camper. Now I saw the day-1 DLC and was disappointed, but what do you know CA goes and says 'Nah fam, you buy our game within one week *actually more like two* you get the Chaos Warriors free'. So that was a great move on CA's part. Blood and Gore DLC for 3 dollars, that's been happening for a while now and makes perfect sense to me. Have the game with no blood for a lower rating for more copies to be sold to younger people, than a month later come out with the bloody stuff so that the older fans can enjoy a higher rated game.   This beastmen DLC going on however has me a bit ticked. Now I understand not every faction can have all their cool and unique units, but the Beastmen roster is already so small, that removes two or four units is basically almost cutting it in half. Now I'm disappointed in the size and the price, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a good size. CA is adding the Beastmen to the grand campaign as foes REGARDLESS of us owning the DLC. That adds more ♥♥♥♥ to the game regardless, not to mention the new stuff we're getting from Update 2.   Now what has me really scared is the Skaven, my number 1 favorite faction, getting their roster slashed a bit. If the new major factions in the coming expansions and DLC have a smaller roster than the 5 Major factions we have now. I will be very disappointed and angry with CA. But that's another story in general because you are wondering one thing.   'Red, why are you telling me all this ♥♥♥♥ but you recommend this game?'  BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT GAME. Sure it doesn't have nearly as many factions as other Total War games, but be honest how many of those factions were even remotely different? Each faction in this game has unique mechanics, heroes, leaders, and units. So yeah I recommend this game, do I recommend the DLC for this game? That depends on what you consider a good deal. For some the DLC is a no go, for others its a great deal.   EDIT- The purpose of this review was less about the game in general, but more about how people are ticked off and giving the game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bad reviews when they aren't upset about the game they are upset about the DLC.",

They all play and feel differently, as well as offer - or require - different tactics. Combat feels quite fast-paced, if not too much so, especially compared to previous titles. It is an issue for some people however, and I can't blame them. Perhaps you just need to get used to it, I've no idea. Some gameplay features are somewhat streamlined or simplified - like the city management, yet, in general, it doesn't end up impacting the gameplay in a too negative way. Performance is surprisingly good. After Attila, I was worried about barely-playable FPS and ridiculous turn timers. And - nothing. On my not-so-modern rig FPS only dips in massive battles, and you don't have to wait ages for AI to process their turns, even in the late-game.  Aside from a few issues here and there, what's already in the game works quite well. But there's not enough of it yet. Current 6 playable races are nothing compared to the (planned) 16. As fun as the Grand Campaign is, it's still in need of new content.  Now, the DLCs. My opinions on the pricing aside, DLCs that add new races are good stuff. They're no longer vain palette-swaps with one-two 'new' units. If you're interested in using a certain race - buy it on a discount. If not, you'll still encounter them in Grand Campaign or MP.  Simply having them around adds a lot, even if it's a Horde that may or may not get wiped out 15 turns into the campaign.  All in all, a solid 7.5 /10 with great potential, it does justice to both Warhammer Fantasy and Total War series. Would kill them /raise them again.",

I liked how the grand campaign victory conditions were a lot more reasonable than in certain more recent total wars.

In TW Warhammer, you never get the feeling that you're the strongest, nobody can match you, but you're only halfway towards satisfying victory conditions.

I am a longtime Warhammer fan (grew up playing 40K tabletop), and this is a really enjoyable representation of it on PC. The emphasis on lore is apparent throughout the game, and the idiosyncrasies of Games Workshop's approach to fantasy really shines. If you're a Warhammer fan who hasn't bought the game, it's very much an enjoyable jump back into the universe.  I also highly enjoy the gameplay. The game seems centered around the campaign, where you choose a race and one (of typically two) leaders, and then are given a starting city and army. The campaign is played on a turn based strategic map, where you manage armies and cities, with real time battles in an RTS format. The economics and strategy have a mild learning curve, but a few hours is enough to figure out how to be fairly successful. The RTS battles also have a moderate learning curve, and as you gain new units or try new races you'll experience fairly radical differences in play style. This really reminds me of the tabletop game, it's nice to see it so well represented.  The base game comes with enough playable factions (Dwarves, Empire, Greenskins, Vampire Counts) that you can experience a wide range of play styles in the RTS battles. I have only played the Dwarf campaign enough to comment on it in depth, but it's definitely enjoyable and I will play the other campaigns in the future. I was able to obtain the base game at a discount, with the chaos warriors DLC, for pre-order, but I think it's well worth full price. Follow-up DLC seems fairly expensive, and I'll likely wait for it to go on sale.",

Instead of generals in this there are heroes. Heroes are very strong single unit, and also serves as your armies leader and on top of that you get to choose what weapons, armor, mount, etc they use. The battles are a bit different in this one. If you are the defending a settlement you do not fight in a settlement you fight outside the settlment, however same cannot be said about castle sieges. I personally like this Total War setting more then all the other ones. Overall I would so this is the best Total War game out.",

Total War is a fun game, and focusing solely on the game (not like many of the negative reviews), has a wonderful level of sound, tactics, graphics, and strategy. The races are great at what they're great at, and leave you feeling stranded when you notice their flaws (Undead have no ranged, Dwarves have no spears, Empire have no real large units) and is thoroughly enjoyable.  Total war has always offered DLCs for packs and campaigns, and quite why anyone seeing a mix with Games Workshop would change that is beyond me. Yes, you will be paying if you want to keep playing, but that's just something to live with. The core game has plenty of life, and enough for you to decide whether you want an extra race or campaign, and I'd thoroughly recommend it on that basis alone. Beyond that, the DLCs arent really just DLCs but a whole new game strategy.",

The armies are wildly different in game style and the AI outstanding. Balancing is actually very good (which in a game with such variety of units was no doubt challenging). The game ran well on my medium spec laptop and i highly encourage those considering this title to purchase the Chaos expansion.

I came expecting maybe some people to have some of the small qualms that I have as well, some minor aspects from older games that are just those 'quality of life' details that are missing and would be GREAT to have on Warhammer ( Like fixed formations, for example ) and these to me are minor issues compared to the overall game and I kind of take it as them moving in a more light hearted and a 'average' gamer friendly approach compared to the more diehard tactical players who played older games....  BUT INSTEAD I see a slew of negative reviews based on the DLC practices of the TW series. I find this absolutely disgusting, not only are you hurting the image of a game you love, you're doing it out of spite when LITERALLY THE ENTIRE VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY DOES THE SAME THING. I understand, I really do, this is the biggest grumble from gamers in our day and age but does hurting the rating of your go-to-game REALLY going to change this common practice? You're lying to yourself if you think so.   The TW series, in my opinion, is the greatest RTS you could ever ask for, and although I do not support the DLC practices, I do understand them. It's just what is going on, and not all of gaming is the 'gamer' side of gaming. It's a business too, and I'm sure if the producers of such a fine product had a say in it, there'd be far less DLC and more FLC.  Long story short, although Warhammer as a TW game has left me feeling like some bit is lacking, on the other hand they've opened up a FANTASY universe to players who've only played Historical based games, and brought the love of strat with them. The combat is fun and exciting, the magic is actually balanced ( at least, in my opinion ) and adds a variety to the field. The Warhammer lore is fascinating and grabbing. For people who would review this game as BAD because of a business perspective are just insulting the rest of the loyal fans who enjoy the work put into this game.",

I took the dwarfen lands of Zhufbar and Karak Kadrin, even took some more lands they had taken. At the same time I started a great campaign against the Greenskin hordes who had entirely conquered the south and were driving the dwarfs to annihilation. I chose peace with the Dwarfs and went on a very long and grueling war against the Greenskin. Everything was going well until Chaos came.   Suddenly, I found myself making millitary alliances with several Dwarfen factions and the Border Princes. I even managed a military alliance with the Empire, hell the dwarfs chose to forgo thei ancient grudges to foster a friendship with the Von Carsteins.   I marshalled my thousands of undead warriors and creatures of all shapes and sizes. The wrath of Nagash itself fell upon the cocky Chaos warbands, and Archaon the Everchosen fell in mighty combat against my legions of Blood Knights.

Some minor issues here and there in the game itself but overall a must have for RTS and Turn-Based Strategy fans if you´re in for Orcs, Vampires, Dragons, Giants and Dwarfs (Warhammer it is^^).  Pros: -unique factions that have different playstyles -factions are immersive in their lore and behaviour -the RTS combat is amazing -runs mostly smooth  -you can ride a zombie dragon with your vampire faction leader -you can prevent the end times by suiciding the ever chosen  Cons -DLCs are not worth buying (read below) -loading takes some time -multiplayer isnt well polished (desync for no reason and then suspends complete game instead of just resyncing with host) -lags when you end your turn -city building and managing is strongly simplified  The DLC policies. They´re horrible. And im talking about €A horrible here.... Even tho i made the mistake and bought them because i thought there was more content to it... Get the base game and mod the hell out of it.  Dont make the mistake (yet) and buy the DLCs. There are mods which add dozens of new units to the game you dont need to pay 7 € for 6 new units. get the gore mod and dont buy the blood for the blood god DLC  My Setup: i7 6700 @3.4ghz gtx970 OC 4G 16GB DDR4 @2133mhz Game installed on HDD (loading would be faster if you put it on ssd)",

If you are a fan of the series you won't be disappointed, and remarkably if you are also a lore-nerd for Warhammer then I think you'll agree that this game is pretty spot on. If you're just browsing and you don't know a thing about Warhammer and have never played the Total War series then don't ignore it. A friend of mine picked this title up recently with no prior knowledge and is loving it.   The game is beauiful, the battles interesting, the unit interactions and rosters are fantastic. I suppose a minor criticism might be that regardless of which Lord you start your campaign with you start in each Factions capital. This limits replayability a little as you can't play any subfactions of the Empire or of ther Dwarfs, for example. This really doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game though.   The diplomacy is harder than in previous games, and trading can be extremely tricky to set up depending on which faction you are. This, appropriately, swings the game more towards war and fighting, which is no bad thing.   Each faction has a unique playstyle and this is really what makes the game great. I'm looking forward to seeing what DLC CA release. At the moment the factions are a bit thin on the ground, but that just leaves room to develop this game organically.   There's lots more to this game than mentioned here, but I'm too busy playing it to write any more... which probably says something!",

Only real cons arethe confederated races as when you think you almost got them crushed, they absorb another faction. (I'm looking at you empire!) Also, Hero spam. Happened around turn 170ish, but having a general surrounded by 6 agents that are spamming the bejesus out of my army and decimating it with RNG was a bit frustrating. However, I'll say that during my own next playthrough I'll be utlizing agent support more.   Overall, wonderful game with near countless hours of replayability!

System specs (so you can compare):  i7 6700k 4Ghz 32gb Corsair Dominator ram 6gb ASUS ROG 980ti Gigabyte Gaming G1 mobo Samsung M.2 SSD Windows 10  PROS:  - Great smooth graphics in both map and battles on ultra settings - Battle AI massivley improved from Rome 2 etc - Character skill tree with loads of options - Lords can have loads of different followers and unique armour and weapons applied to them (warhorse for example) - Heros that can affect map provinces, but also be used in battles too - Decent amount of research options - Quests to keep campaign interesting - Many factions to fight (or engage in dimplomacy with) - Brilliant range of units and all very unique for each race - Flying units! nuff said - Your leader actually feels like a leader and can dramatically turn the tide in a battle - Routing units are now sensible enough to stop for a breather once far enough away and will mostly rejoin fight (unlike Rome 2 where they ran away even if there was enough of them to come back and get involved again) - Good amount of buildings to choose from that all play a part in shaping your province/empire - Unique flags that can be assigned to individual units for each battle (this is a great feature and can turn a strong base unit into a devastating unit if applied to the correct one) - Many other cool things that you will have to play to find out!  CONS:  - Map is good, but I feel it could have been a bit bigger. Rome 2 and Attilla felt bigger. Still, it is decent and will take a great leader to conquer - Early days of my first campaign as Empire felt a bit hand-holdy, like they are sending you down a particular pre-determined path (I understand this is kinda how they integrate the tutorial and advance the 'story', but maybe there is a better way for future games) - Chaos arrive by turn 22 in my game, seems a bit early for such a strong devastating race to be introduced - Would have been nice to have more than 4 races to choose from (no doubt DLC will change all that) - Empire on empire battles in early game start to get a bit repetitive as all units are the same and you kinda learn quickly how to win (Empire vs other races is where it no doubt starts to get good)  All in all, I am mightly impressed at how polished the game feels for day one release and am so glad we have a Total War that just feels right again. If CA stick to this formula the future for the other games (Rome etc) looks good. I just hope they do, as they have nailed it this time.",

Yet this depth is a two-edged sword. The fan base of Warhammer is a diverse lot, many players have a particular faction they are very attached to. With so my detail to include, it would have been very difficult for the developers to have all units for all factions available in the base game. What they have provided us is a solid selection of the core armies in great detail.  I have yet to explore the campaign portion in great depth. Instead, I have focused on exploring all the units available via custom battles.  Yes, the launch has had some issues. The black screen was encountered by me and all it took was trying again for it to work. Others haven't been so fortunate but there are already some workarounds that appear to mitigate the issue. Performance on my gaming laptop with an Nvidia 780M is adequate when the details are turned down to medium/high and it still looks good. In battle performance seems smooth so far, even with multiple full-card armies rampaging around.

PROS * Varied unit lists that really does feel like Warhammer Fantasy, be it the undead, the chaos trolls, the flying units, the giants etc etc. Finally we have some real, massive character to the units * A campaign that actually can pack in some story, including storyline battles etc, which is a really neat way to get in the 'historical battles' into a fantasy setting. We have context to the Battle of Agincourt, but not 'The siege of Kakarak ka krak(or whatever, dwarf names are weird) and these campaign mission battles really provides that.  * Magic! (admittedly a little underwhelming but still) * A beautiful world map with lots of details and character * Diplomacy doesn't seem that pants-on-head stupid, which is a plus  CONS * Only five playable races. I understand they are going to make more but still, it's not that varied. (I want my high elves and/or lizardmen) * The system with artefacts seems a bit in need of tweaking. My empire campaign has me overloaded with crap (wonder if you could sell them) * The Story Battles in the campaign can get in the way of campaign game flow: 'Hmm I could take this army to fight this random battle here that'll net me a neat artefacts, or I could take it to stomp those undead guys... eh screw it, I can do that battle later'.  Conclusion Certainly some people will complain and I can't say I don't understand where they're coming from, but I'm having the time of my life right now. It remains to be seen if it'll have the longevity of the other games though, but with each race having a fundamentally unique playstyle, I think I'll be good for a good while longer.",

NOTE 2: Ignore the people who have negatively reviewed this game due to the fact that they haven't been able to laucnh the game due to launch issues. You CANNOT review a game if you haven't played it. As of 7PM BST, a CA have released a hotfix which has fixed these launch issues. If you are still experiencing such issues go to the TW forums.   It is a real shame that people are negatively reviewing this game simply because of the issues, as mentioned above, without playing the game first. Why? Because this game is, from the limited time I have played it, absolutely fantastic. From the get go on my Empire campaign I have had a polished, optimised and exciting experience which I have not had since Shogun 2.   The AI has proved a challenge (playing on HARD difficulty), recruiting well balanced armies of infantry, range and cavalry which creates exciting battles which are beautiful to watch. That being said have yet to experience magic being used as I am currently facing off against human factions (refer to other reviews). The AI employs raiding and ambushes on the campaign map and always poses a huge threat to you the player.  I have yet to suffer from any major bugs, although there does appear to be a sound bug around my settlements which sounds like they are being besieged, although they are not. I am sure this will be fixed by CA in the near future. Other than that minor inconveince, I have yet to suffer from game crashes, graphical errors or weird AI behaviour on the battlefield and campaign map.   Overall my early impressions of Total War: Warhammer are very good indeed and I look forward to delving into the game deeper and experience more of what the game offers. I happily recomend this to all.  PS: I know the launch issues are very annoying and it is understandable that you would be angry at not being able to play a game that you have spent money on. Now as I have said a hotfix has been released which supposedly fixes the launch issues. I can personally confirm that I am now able to the launch the game with Steam online. Again though, if the problems still persist go onto the Total War forums for help, or you can try these quick fixes which I hope will help you experience the game I am throughly enjoying. - Start the game with Steam offline - Verify interigity of the game  ",

Even races that didn't interest me personally much (Dwarves, Humans) have turned out to be spectacular, brutal campaigns   Diplomacy feels real and viable for the established setting   Generals (Lords) are incredibly powerful and have a huge impact on the battle   TW:W also includes some very welcome and refreshing features that make this game stand out from predecessors in both the Total War &amp; Warhammer franchises:    Faction &amp; item unique spells &amp; abilities for your Heros/Lords, and faction-unique research trees make for an incredibly varied, tactical and all-encompassing experience both on and off the battlefield   Narrative quests pertinent to the Warhammer universe that reward your Lord with awesome gear   An incredible array of units, from your typical cannon fodder infantry to unique creatures like giants, monstrous cavalry &amp; flying beasts   RPG elements, such as equipable items, followers &amp; mounts   I would definitely recommend this game if you're a Total War or a Warhammer veteran. I would also recommend this game if you're new to either of them.   All-in-all, this is a great game, and worth the full $59.99. As for DLC, CA is notoriously terrible for pushing out pricey, underwhelming DLC...but if all factions coming in future DLCs are as unique and well thought out as the ones already in the game, $8 is...reasonable.

Shogin 2 was the best total war so far, but the factions were almost the same. This doesny apply here. The units, the buldings, and even basic campaign mechanics vary with each playable race. All of them are a lot fun, and you wont get bored with any of them. In my opinion in general the unit upkeeps are a bit too high for almost every faction, but fortunately, mods are supported from day 1, and you can get any mod you want.",

I am sat at work counting down the time I can play it and snuck off to write this review!  I am not into Warhammer, I used to go to Game workshop as a kid but found it was very expensive so lost interest. This game however is great regardless if you like Warhammer or not.  I always down rate total war games because of the endless pay DLC but at the moment this is a 5/5 for me. The only qualms I would have is that there is no Blood and Gore which I have bought for Rome and Atilla, I will now, I imagine, have to buy it for this game too.   Sega have definitely turned the game a bit too much of a money sink for my liking.  P.S YES I did have problems but used my brain and started the game in offline mode. Worked for me first time of trying.  EDIT = I still enjoy this game, it's a situation where you absolutely love the actual masterpiece that has been created but those that created it are money grabbing turds who have no respect for their fans. If CA want to keep producing games like this cut the DLC crap and start making a full game. Better yet I'd rather buy expansions than DLC.",

Plus it's great to see mods amend the minor gripes that mar an otherwise fantastic game.  I know people have some issues with DLC, but, I think this game is actually one oft he fairer DLC models I've seen. Let's say you only want to play as one of the base factions, you do NOT need any of the (admittedly pricey) faction DLC, at all! The factions are embedded into your singlep layer games as a free update even if you lack the related content. The exceptions to this are the Grim and the Grave and the various legendary lord duos and DLC. However these only offer twists on existing campaigns in the base game with some new takes on the grand campaign for each lord respectively, they don't really bring in new or unique units.",

Unit diversity is really cool for a TW game. The heroes are fun and also makes it quite frustrating when you lose one because there's a huge time investment there. The Lords are similar as above but can totally change the tide of a combat. The action was fast paced for this type of game. I was being attacked in four different directions all over the map. I had no bugs in my entire playthrough. The music was a good compliment to the action. The items on your heroes are very unique and can turn the tide of a battle. It's definitely worth doing the item quests. The battles are really fun and have a lot of great tactics and detail, but by turn 150+ you will mostly auto-resolve.  CONS:  It's VERY hard to get more than 5-6 large armies. The mechanics of the game are limiting in that way, which makes it hard to defend against the Chaos from up North West, North, and North East and the Greenskins and Vampire Counts from the South. I had almost every settlement maxed out to give me gold and it was still hard fielding 6 armies. The long campagin win is longggggggggggggggg. The tech trees make it very difficult to make everything in one province. It would be nice if some of the smaller cities could go up to Level 4 at least--especially in Reiksland.  Summary:  If you like Total War, this is a great game for you. If you like Warhammer, this is a great game for you. I've played both series since Shadow of the Horned Rat came out, and the original TW. This one will be installed for many many years to come.",

The perfect blend between the beloved Total War series and one of the best fantasy universes out there, the pairing is awesome, both on paper and in execution. Surely a work worthy of the divine!  As a long time Warhammer fan i adore the amount of work and details Creative Assembly has put into staying true to the Warhammer franchise. There is a emmence amount of love put into realising the Warhammer part. Little details in notifications received on the campaing map are constatly putting a smile on my face and sometimes blowing my mind. Little things like that are true to the Warhammer universe in that they use the lore of the setting.  It is truly an experience for instance to have an advisor    who is not just some Gandalf figure existing only to advise you but have motives for doing so. Those motives can be figured out if the game is played in a certain way! And in the world of warhammer that plot makes SENSE!    Another part that i am happy Creative Assembly has gotten right is the dark and sometimes hooligan like humor of the setting. To strike a peace treaty with a very evil faction only for them to announce the sacrifices they will make to celebrate feels haunting.  Another example could be the sometimes brutal beating the games ultimate villain Chaos receive from the local hooligans: The Orcs and Goblins. To see the doomtide run and avoide the slaughter of vile dimwits, or perhaps being forced to plow through the lands of the undead, is a thing that seems almost unique to the Warhammer universe and with this game you can play such a story on the computer! What a time to be alive.  The game offers some unique experiences to veteran Total War players as well. The inclusion of magic and monster units gives a new dimention and depth to the combat system. The campaign map is simple and effective but also the only thing which is lacking in a sense. It is clear that the Warhammer world always has been about the combat in its tabletop form and therefore economy and city management in the setting had to be, lets say 'invented', by the developers. However when ever there is a piece of lore about how ordinary life i spent or where cities or important building are, they are respected and realised.   The battles look stunning! The perk of the fantasy setting is visible here most of all. The only thing there that needs some work perhaps are sieges.  Total War: Warhammer shines in the sense that it shakes up the Total War franchise and makes the Warhammer world come to life in a way that it has never been done before. The developers also seems keen to pop out new contents, some for free others paid, and updates to the game. That fantasy setting has also allowed for unique Total War gameplay.  Verdict: 9.5/10  Last words: I cannot recommend this game enough. And sorry for missing commas english is not my first language!",

TW:WH is also pretty acceptable lorewise, as much as possible without comprimising the 'fun' part. Now the problems though: This game has not nearly as many factions to play as other Total Wars. And every new DLC costs loads of money. This is redeemed in my eyes by the work that has gone into each faction. In contrast to other Total Wars, every faction is very unique. Also, hopefully at the end there will be the whole Warhammer Fantasy world (which is massive).   To put this all together: This game is great and expansive, expect to get around 30 hours out of every 15 $ DLC and ~100 hours out of the base game if you like either Total War or Warhammer.",

If you're just browsing and you don't know a thing about Warhammer and have never played the Total War series then don't ignore it. A friend of mine picked this title up recently with no prior knowledge and is loving it.   The game is beauiful, the battles interesting, the unit interactions and rosters are fantastic. I suppose a minor criticism might be that regardless of which Lord you start your campaign with you start in each Factions capital. This limits replayability a little as you can't play any subfactions of the Empire or of ther Dwarfs, for example. This really doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game though.   The diplomacy is harder than in previous games, and trading can be extremely tricky to set up depending on which faction you are. This, appropriately, swings the game more towards war and fighting, which is no bad thing.   Each faction has a unique playstyle and this is really what makes the game great. I'm looking forward to seeing what DLC CA release. At the moment the factions are a bit thin on the ground, but that just leaves room to develop this game organically.   There's lots more to this game than mentioned here, but I'm too busy playing it to write any more... which probably says something!",

For some unkown reason, the performance of the game will be bad if my settings are low but the perfomance will be much better if the settings are High. For those who are having FPS issues, try setting it to high and see does it helps. Btw, i am using GTX 950M, 8GB ram, i5 62000U 2.8 GHz.   Pros - Good unit roster - New gameplay - Good Graphics  Cons - Small campaign map - Only have 5 factions to choose in grand campaign - FPS can be unstable - Some crashes ",

            "review_text": "Heya! This review is specifically made for those peeps wondering similar along the lines of: 'Hmm Total War, I've heard about it, should I buy it?' or 'Ohh! Warhammer in an RTS game style! Should I buy it?'  Answer: First you got to look at the price. Bit steep I know, But I HIGHLY suggest to buy this game if you are, a Hardcore Total War fan, a Warhammer fan or a RTS loving Fan. Total War: Warhammer has all the essentials on being one of the greatest RTS of recent release. And with it's upcoming DLC of Realm of WoodElves, it's sure going to amp up the gamers that are already playing it.  So, this isn't a 'Fast' Review, I'm gonna send out the viable information for a person to either buy this game or completely skip it.  Pro: - Immersive Campaign: If you had known Total War CA company, it's that they love their lore as much as they love their fans. The Campaigns Single or even Multiplayer Campaigns are soooo fun, and it's no less expected from Warhammer's lore intergrated into the Virtual Gaming platform, every characters, actions and locations are all aspects of realms that really gives the player the motivation and inspiration to do his best at all times.  - Races/Rosters/Factions: The fact that CA has made a really balanced gameplay in their games; Shogun II, ATILA, Medieval II is because of the versatile sets of Rosters/Races/Factions, they are all uniquely made to fill different types of uses from different individual players and their play-style. Some perhaps favours some more than others or perhaps they just enjoy everything. The races in Total War: Warhammer uniquely gives the player the accessibility of strategic and tactical gameplay, learning new tricks and curves to potentially win the game.  - Multiplayer: The Multiplayer experience from Campaign to Custom Battles are impendingly exciting to watch. From the classic 1v1 scenario to a 3v3 Scenario in Land Battles, Subterranean and Siege Battles, there's lots of different ways to go about your daily warmongering hunger!  Con: Cost: Possibly the most problematic aspect of the game, CA was notorious on it's sales. For people to pay the same amount for more content released (Beastmen, Grim and the Grave, King and Warlord, BLOOD GORE!) easily gives the game a negative standing. I for one have money to spend, and while the recent releases are understandable in price, Call of the Beastmen, and the Blood Gore dlc are not.   Campaign Player Limit Restriction: A friend of mine REFUSES to play a Total War game that only has two player in it's Campaign. I for one, speculate that CA will intergrate more players in Campaign in the mere future but as of now, the Multiplayer Campaign experience are limited to Two Players only! Bummer!  Map Limitations: The maps are all made wonderiously, a shame that it can't be said toward Siege Battles. The sieges last averagely 15-20 minutes. While most Total War games like Medieval or ATILA can go on about 50-60+ minutes. The Siege is less exciting because of the Inevitable Wall Climb strat as well as the gate being held against the attackers' side. I for one encourage CA to intergrate some sort of variability on InnerWalls rather than have JUST the Exterior Walls.  And that's pretty much all the Predicament I've yet to witness in all honesty. I will be playing more and more and more, briefly updating this review so that people in the future can also be updated upon whether they'd buy this game.  So TL:DR? BUY THE GAME, IT IS COSTLY AND SOME ARE UNREASONABLY EXPENSIVE BUT IF YOU LOVE RTS, TOTAL WAR OR WARHAMMER EXCLUSIVELY AND INCLUSIVELY, IT'S WORTH IT!   ",

            "review_text": "The price is high but if you can afford it, it's worth it! I bought this game including most of the DLC (wood elves was not out yet) for more than 100€s. That is an appaling price! I think the game needs the DLCs to work best, so be prepared to spend alot if you are going to invest in this game.  But to the game itself: -If you are familiar with the Total War game engine, this is the best instalment I have played so far. The mechanics are still rather clunky (for instance you need to pause every time you weant to move your troops, or they are going to stand sideways or some other nonsense). -The implementation of the Warhammer Old World works rather well. You play in the time when Carl Franz is trying to gather The Empire, and can choose from several factions (according to what DLCs you have installed). I like that there are many factions of dwarves, men and orcs&amp;goblins, that may fight amongst themselves or together against a common enemy. each faction will like you better when you act against their faction enemies (Orcs for dwarves, Chaos for men), and like you less if you act against them or their friends and allies. -You can choose to skip fights that you have interest in. This helps the storyline along, without too many breaks to deal with small raiding armies etc.   Bad stuff: -Gold is everything! It's a bit silly that money rules the old world in the same way that it does the real one. If there where demons and chaos warriors, there might be people who where willing to fight against these, not just for the $$$ of it. Even if Order (morale+anti-chaos in one) is at the maximum there is no real bonus from it. Other than it not being low. I am missing some third ressource to bring a better balance to the structure of the game. -Agents can sometimes rule the game. To do so they need Gold, and to counter them you need Gold. If you don't have Gold there is nothing you can do.  Conclusion: -A good game, but VERY expensive. Not just the main game, but you need a lot of DLCs, and those are not cheap either. -The best Warhammer Fantasy Battle installation I have played. And with the different factions for me to play, it will be some time before I am through with this.   I am yet to try the multiplayer part, but I fear it will be a pain since you will need to pause often during the battles.  ",

Warhammer is a fantasy setting in the old world, prior to its destruction. There is a wide variety of races, gods, settings, everything you would expect from a fantasy world. Note, that on release there was a fraction of these playable and with the release of dlc they are trickling more and more of them in.  I realise some peoples opinions on dlc and I can understand that, growing up in the age when, when you bought a game you had it until the release of the next big expansion. Times have changed and this is the world we live in. Total War franchise is now under SEGA's wing and love it or hate it this is the way forward for gaming. In their defence, as well as paid dlc there is also free dlc lumped in along the way, while some of the dlc is a bit on the expensive side, you can pick and choose the races you want, or wait for the inevitable sale.  If you like the Total War series, or are a Warhammer or any generic fantasy fan, then I highly recommend this game. It has settlement management and lord/army management and lets face it monumental battles (which is why we are here).  So if you love smashing face with a giant or swooping down castle battlements on a zombie dragon then buy this game!",

Mod support is from the steam workshop and works seemlessly.  If you've been out of total war for a few years (like me) this is the game to come back in with. If you've never heard of Total War this is a great game to start with. And I don't know anything about Warhammer lore but this game has it and the presentation is suberb. The sound assests and are great and don't feel canned like they have been in the past. Really helps with the immersion.  The 'Mostly Positive' reviews don't do the game justice, most were left due to being unable to start the game the first few hours of release, and that problem has been fixed. This game brings total war back to being a classic. Its just more fun to kill orcs and vampires than to kill historically accurate factions from irl history.  Best Use of A Farm Animal also.",

Some are very essential, like managing your gold intake, or managing your soldiers to see if you can support them. So I guess my problem was that the game doesn't help you as a new Total War player learn the deeper game concepts. Second, most battles just go way to quick, and it leads to you as the player usually not being satisfied, the main problem with this is how quickly groups of enemies flee, but this can be fixed with certain Steam Workshop mods.   DLC MODEL: I remember when I first bought this game, a lot of people weren't happy where it was going. People were mad because cut content was being sold back to us as paid dlc. This doesn't seem right, and I didn't agree with it at the time, but CA has fixed the situation for us. CA is currently giving away free dlc along with paid dlc for those who want it.

Pros: - The Factions differ from each other. So whenever you start a new game, each campaign feels like a new TW - Battles are cool. Did you like the fight scenes in the Lord of the Rings movies? You'll be throwing spearmen against Trolls and Giants, run down stunties with Orc Boar Boyz, shred infantry lines with cannons and steam tanks, shoot down dragons with Thunderers, etc - Hero units with unique abilities. From Battle priests to Orc Shamans to Vampires, these units can charge with the front line to give an edge for attackers, give massive buffs and debuffs, and cause units to laugh themselves to death, among other spells. - Simplified campaign map. This may be a con to some, but in past total wars, it was a cluster♥♥♥♥. - Mods. You can add units, tweak gameplay, and adjust other things with mods on the workshop - Runs well on most PCs! Past TWs at launch had horrible stablity issues. This one ran smooth from the get go  Cons: - Price. The base game only has 4 factions (Empire, Dwarfs, Orcs, Vampires) and there is an extensive DLC library already. These include Blood Pack, Chaos Warriors, Beastmen, misc Unit Packs. With the Beastmen (can play a seperate campaign map along with the main campaign map) and soon Wood Elves costing around $20 and other dlcs around $7, it gets expensive - Cheating, dumb AI. Uping the difficulty only gives more money to other AI factions. The tatics don't change. Also with diplomacy, the AI tends to make outrageous demands. Kind of funny, really - Unit formations are gone. No more spear walls or wedge calvary   Overall, bretty gud gaem. But it's expensive if you want to complete package.",

            "review_text": "So, first things first; this is not a faithful recreation of the Table Top version. If that is what you are expecting or want, then you will be disappointed. Having said that, it is also not wholly unrecognisable either. You have heroes, monsters, magic, and big blocks of infantry and cavalry all charging around having a baller time. All the staple elements of the Table Top game, and without the ball ache of assembling and painting them (or if you're like me, assembling and then NOT painting them).   It is first and foremost, however, a Total War game, with all that implies. So there is nation management: You build things in your cities. You construct armies: picking from a roster of troops (which are admirably different depending on which race you pick - largely no reskins here) and send them out into the world to fight and die for you, and hopefully to conquer a wee bit of land first. There is resource management: buildings, some skills, and some actions (raiding) generate an income, from which you maintain your armies and construct new ones and cities too. If your outgoings exceed your income, expect troops to desert. There are also luxury items, but they don't seem all that useful, except for generating cash.   The strategic view, where most of this stuff happens is largely similar to other Total War games (and, as with most stuff in TW games, is a gradual - and largely positive - evolution). The map seems to be bigger, and graphically more impressive. It is also more Gamesworkshopy too, so mountains are taller, forests darker, spiders are bigger and there are skulls everywhere. It's pretty neat. I like it.   But it's the tactical (battle) view where most of the obvious differences are, and where the game is most familiar to the Plastic Men version. Two armies line up and pummel the living daylights out of each other. In the campaign, it is rarely an equal or fair fight: inevitably, one side is larger, or has better units, or a superior general, or more useful terrain, or all of the above. But that's ok, because it means the strategic view is just as (perhaps more) important. Now, full disclosure: I'm not very good at the battles, even against the AI. I normally require a decent upper hand to win. But again, that's ok.   The battles themselves are a mighty maelstrom of dying and fighting. Big blocks of infantry cluster and charge and counter charge. Heroes smash their way through lesser troops in impressively cinematic sequences, and magic manages to be both important, but not overpowered. Monsters pummel puny line troops and artillery smashes everything. It's good fun.   Negatives. The DLC policy can be tiresome, but there is a decent dripfeed of FLC, and no one is forcing you to buy it all. In fact, I've yet to purchase any DLC, as key mechanics are free, and the paywall tends to be restricted to playing as the new factions.   Some of the quest battles (a largely neat feature) can be unbalanced. And the (spoiler) Chaos invasion at the end seems unstoppable, but was very much a paper tiger, once the AI armies inevitably split up.   it can also be a bit daunting to a newbie, and this should probably not be your first TW game - although it is worth persevering.   Finally, f**k Grimgore Ironhide. That guy is ridiculous.",

During my war against the vampire counts i absorbed 2 of the houses into the empire without a fight, my trade contracts were up and running with the Northern houses as well as the south western kingdoms of bretonia, i moved further south and claimed the gate way into the orkish lands and along with my drawf allies stopped the ork horde from entering the empire lands, turned my army towards the north and after huge bloody campaigns and a powerfull alliance with drawfs and remaning northen houses we stopped the huge apocalyptic march of chaos. Emperor karl franz personally slew chaos leader archon,my warrior priests were busy putting down chaos corruption in my lands and witch hunters were busy hunting down cults of chaos or vampires, i finally united all the empire and now am the most powerful kingdom in the old world, iv sent my armies to the north to further stop the warbands of chaos in the frozen wastes of the north. with drawfs as my powerful allies our next target is to move south and end the orkish threat that is massing up at our eastern borders . this is total war warhammer one of the most awesome games iv ever played  all this happened in my 18hours of gameplay :)   I am running the game at absolute max settings @1600p on a 980ti g1 and a i7 4770k This is my new fav Total war game after the awesome medieval 2 total war",

            "review_text": "Now, I should start with a sort of disclaimer. I've heard many things about this game, and most of them seem to be comparing it to previous TW games. Apparently it has been severly 'dumbed down', and lacks the cool features the other games have had. For all I know, this is totally correct. Personally I have only played TW: Napoleon , and not for very long, so when I give this review it is actually emphasising on the 'warhammer' part of 'Total War: Warhammer', rather than the 'Total War' part. Now, with the elongated and mostly useless sort of disclaimer out of the way, my thoughts on the game.  Bloody good fun.  Thats my brief summary of the game. Yes, there are many aspects that need refining;  -DLC is a bit overpriced (Though most of the time adds excellent content) -Diplomacy is less than great. Personally I believe it would benefit if it were something more akin to the Civ5 diplomacy, because as of current options are severely limited and factions that should require diplomacy (Cough cough the Empire) are able to do virtually nothing, as everybody usually hates them and there is no way to surpass them. -And much much more! BUT. and this is the 'but' part. The game is flawed in many ways. However, if you are able to get over these issues, you are left with an incredibly entertaining game. The real-time combat really feels different and fun, in part to the multiple race selections and incredible unit rosters, the fighting and strategies involved vary immensly, from an Orc charge followed by a multitude of giant spiders and kamikazing Goblins (My personal favourite) to versatile elves mixing between hiding in forests and firing at the enemy, before ramming then with Reindeer charges* and giant trees from behind. Oh, and also magic. Gotta love magic during combat. The campaign map is also quite useful and fits the game quite well. I am personally a fan of the province linking system, I find that it simplifies the settlements and is quite handy. That and the diverse landscapes, filled with frozen wastes, lush forests, vast deserts and icy mountain ranges. It's also pretty sweet how certain factions, such as the Vampire Counts, Elves and Chaos influence the campaign map as they conquer, meaning the map is in constant flux. Lastly, what I believe to be a highlight of the game is the modding community. There is such a vast array in the mods available to the game, made by the community. If there's something you don't like about the game (Or many, many things.) then there's usually a mod to alter it to your liking. Or, just, y'know, adds more cow carcasses to be fired from trebuchets. Anything is possible with mods.  So, if you've lasted this long through my waffle of a review, just remember that yeah, this game is flawed. And broken. And has issues. But if you can get past those mostly petty grievances, it's an incredibly fun game.   *No, as far as I gather, the Wood Elves actually get Stags' as mounts, not Reindeer, but they look similar enough that I just want to believe.",

            "review_text": "TLDR:   Buy it if you are hardcore into Warhammer, don't mind the very steep price tag and you want to read lore and see fantasy armies battle it out.   Pass if you want a reasonably priced strategy game that is deep, involved and fun to play.  You need to use a little foresight when considering a purchase of Total War: Warhammer. We are now seven months post release and there exists $65 worth of DLC at the moment. So, if you're looking for a complete experience consider this a $125 game. Ditto that for part two and three and you are looking at a $375 game. Are you alright with that? If so, read on.   The bread and butter of this game is the animated battles. Bottom line, if you don't care about watching fantasy armies slaughtering eachother in real time you should just save yourself a lot of money and move on right now. The strategy, RPG elements and empire building in this game are nonexistant to barely recognizeable.  Strategy begins and ends with trying to flank a paper unit with your scissors unit. RPG elements begin and end with equiping boring items and putting skill points into (mostly) generic trees for your generals. Empire building begins and ends with deciding which (mostly) generic building trees you want to invest in then you just cut-n-paste across every region you conquer.   Diplomacy is terrible and really just exists as a ton of spam you click through at the beginning of each round. As a dwarf you will get peace treaties from orcs and vampires, as if that makes any sense whatsoever. Vampires may declare war on you one turn then proceed to offer you gold for a peace treaty for the next 30 turns.  The turn-based overland map is so clunky and random there seems to be little purpose outside of looking for battles that you can win. Your limited field of vision ensures enemy armies will constantly run in from the shadows and decimate your cities and armies before you have a chance to react. They exhibit minimal AI and seem to exist as a harassing agent until they are disposed of. The story is barebones, impersonal and largely uninteresting. Their is a very comprehensive encyclopedia of Warhammer lore built into the engine so you can read up on a lot of stuff if that is your scene.  The battles are pretty cool at first. Who can deny the awesomeness of clashing armies in a fantasy universe? Performace is acceptable and the graphics are noteworthy with a decent rig. The highlight is the clashing of armies but they quickly devolve into blops of units with only the front line attacking. Everyone else just sort of stands around waiting for their turn to kill or die. This tends to be immersion breaking if you really dial in to a single battle. Keep the camera moving, however, and you can look past this unfortunate issue. The tedious, redundant nature of the battles are unescapable, unfortunately. The blood and gore DLC is required, in my opinion, to give any sense of soul to these battles. I literally quite playing the game after a few hours because it was an obvious omission that seriously reduced one's level of enjoyment.  Bottom line, battles get boring and they get boring fast. Battle maps are limited and you will never fight in sprawling cities or castle towns. You basically have two battle maps: wilderness or a siege against a single wall. The vast majority of units can only be told where to go or who to attack. No skills, formations or stances mean battles are a click-and-watch affair. Cool for the first few times but TW:W turns into an auto-resolve game very quickly. This is never more true than during the horribly under-developed seige battles. Ugh. What's left is the turn-based world map and, well, I already told you what I think of that.",

The main factions are all unique and play very differently. and i have noticed very few balance issues.  2.) the map is gorgeous, if a little small  3.)The new siege battles are intense, quick, and can be challenging.  4.) the legendary lords work out beautifully  5.) EASILY THE BEST LAUNCH CA HAS HAD IN YEARS. No game breaking glitches, no crazy OP units, good job team  The BAAAAAAAD Most of the issues i have revolve around them trying to fix past mistakes  1.) In the past, balance issues have always been a problem. so, in this game the 5 (soon to be six) factions are all done really really well: at the cost of all the minor factions just being copy-pasted verisons of the main ones. doesnt really make sense  2.) Small city battles had a tendancy to get dull and repetative, due to the small number of MAPS for the small city battles. So the best fix for that would be to make a larger variety of maps, yes? NOT ACCORDING TO CA. They decided to get rid of small city battles altogether, meaning that you'll be fight out in the OPEN. This basically invalidates the garrisons for small cities. Not much point fighting when you cant tactically deploy. As such, you might as well auto-resolve, save you some time  3.) again, in response to naval battles not ever beingreal good, they simply go back to the medival 2 style, of forced autoresolves  The rest of the issues are only concerning if they dont make an effort to fix them. Leaving to reason i cannot reccomend this game:  4.) Cereative assembly is charging absurd prices already for Downloadable content. The Call of the Beastmen expansion adds a new faction to the game. Thats it: It adds everything that a new complete faction would need. And they decided to charge you 19 dollars for this. THAT MAKES THIS FACTION MORE THEN DOUBLE THE COST OF ANY OTHER FACTION. Case in point? Chaos Warriors are 8 bucks. They expect you to pay a THIRD of the price the FULL GAME was, for ONE faction. As such, i cannot in good conscience reccomend Total War Warhammer.",

And still you have a small race roster, a small campaign map and you're also going to have to pay even more for races and content that should already be in here or atleast should be free to download. C'mon sega and CA this is gaming not used car sales. Last total war title I will ever buy.  ",

Because of this when I finally finished downloading the game I was glued to the game for pretty much 3 days straight and the base game is amazing. The mechanics of flying units is great, having hero's you can level up on the campaign map with their own special abilities and new mounts is an awesome addition, new monstrous units such as giants and chaos spawn offer a really nice break from the repetitive units from the old total war games. I would arguably have our first good warhammer game and so far the best total war game.  Despite this there is A LOT wrong with the game. First of all, the battles are way too short compared to other total war games. This means battles are mainly micro managing units and removes the chance to enter cinematic mode and watch chaos giants ripping off the heads of empire swordsman. Secondly, the unit selection for a lot of nations (mainly the empire) are limited compared to the board game. For example, empire unit progression goes from spearmen to shielded spearmen, which as you guessed are the exact same but one has shields. Thirdly, chaos in the grand campaign mode are way too easy to beat. I first started the game on normal difficulty playing as the Dawi and despite losing one army absolutely crushed Archaon and his hoards. Started another two playthroughs after that (both on hard difficulty) one as the empire and another as the Dawi and once again got bored as managed to crush chaos with ease. But finally my biggest gripe with this game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC policy. Wtf creative assembly? I have to pay around £9 to play as the main antagonists of the game? Which I would argue is the most popular warhammer faction to play as. Also why do I also have to pay £2 to unlock blood and gore in a warhammer game? Despite the uproar from the fans in previous total war title's over this issue creative assembly hasn't given a ♥♥♥♥. Next we'll have a Rome faction DLC in Rome 3....",

            "review_text": "Total Warhammer Is a dream cross over for me, It's something I and many other people have wished would happen ever since we played some of the earlier Total War games, there was even a Warhammer mod at one point.  I have dumped a crazy amount of hours into this game already and got my moneys worth. This game Is enjoyable, CA have done a really good job of bringing to life units from tabletop (TT from now on If I need to type it again) both with sticking to the lore and just the art style. Armies feel quite diverse (more so if you compare this game to games like Shogun 2)  CA have also tried to be more transparant after Rome 2, which even after much hard work still doesnt resemble anything close to the trailer we were shown. So has CA done a good job this time, or sold us another lie?  Honestly for me It's a mixed bag. I really enjoyed my first play throughs with most factions (though maybe not Chaos, I can't quite put my finger on what felt wrong with their playstyle, but even the controversial DLC Beastmen seemed to of nailed the horde gameplay mechanics better than the Chaos Warriors faction)  But.. and there is a few buts. The actual combat Is over way too fast If you play with quite small unit sizes. I honestly take more time getting to the enemy than I do In combat, and units seemed to break too quickly for me to implement intresting tactics like flank charges.  So turn unit sizes up right? Well no, you do this and magic suddenly becomes so very weak It's almost useless. I chased CA for weeks over this issues as It's something they have previously refused to adress, I finally got an answer over Facebook and they just told me It was a complex problem and don't expect It to be fixed soon. The problem Is It's not just magic, unique units like Luminark suddenly go from taking 3 shots to kill say a giant on low unit size, up to 7 shots to kill the same unit on Ultra unit size.  This has really bugged me, magic Is so integral to the tactics and lore of Warhammer, so now you have to pick between low unit sized battles with magic working as intended, but then battles are almost arcade like with how quickly they end. Or gimp magic and other things if you turn unit size up which anyone with a half decent GPU will probably want to do. Sadly I'm now looking to mods to fix this as I remember older Total War games having similar problems so I don't have much faith In CA to fix it anyime soon. That Is a plus for this game though, the ability to mod and a brownie point for CA for making it happen.  Another issue Is how things play out on the actual campaign map. The AI knows exactly how far you can move, and will exploit this (or be clever depending on how you view such artifical difficulty) by attacking your weak settlements, then retreating to a well defended castle. This would be fine now and again but It becomes the only tactic the AI does, leading to benny hill esque chases and whack a mole like gameplay. It also leads to a lack of full on field battles which seems a bit silly for a game with a title like this one has. You can learn to adapt to this, using the ambush stance and baiting, but still, it would be nice if the AI mixed it up more.  Speaking of castles, they have changed sieges from how they have been done In previous games. Now you can only ever attack one corner or sometimes one wall, unlike say Shogun 2 you could attack from all four sides of the castle, then within the castle itself had multiple areas defenders could fall back to. Total Warhammer has dumbed this down with CA's explanation being that the Ai got too derpy In complex sieges. Honestly I think this was a horrible decision and once you have played a siege or two, you have played them all. This really should be a sign for CA that they need to invest In the Ai or even make a new engine. Also In my 200+ hours of playing the Ai has encirlced many of my Castles, but it has never once actually tried to lay sige instead hoping it can starve me out, which I have easily avoided by being able to bring an army along to block it. I'm not sure if that is a bug or again just bad AI.  Speaking of Castles and towns, gone are the village battles, instead you get a field battle with your garrison now which Is another feature I miss. There is no depth to buildings either, In previous games you could tailor cities to do quite unique things, like be a economic power house, or gives troops raised there moral boost. But In this game you will find yourself building the same way over and over again with only a slight variance depending on what military units you wish to produce.  This game is fun, nothing quite beats the moments you swoop down with your Lord on some epic mount and clash with the opposing lord. They have expanded on the religion mechanic from previous games, and now factions like Chaos and Vampire Counts taint the actual map which Is another threat you have to contend with. I do like features like this and I do think CA have done a great job with touches like this which bring the Warahmmer world to life (Or death if you play Vampire Counts :P )  I'm figuring most die hard Warhammer and Total War fans have this now or at least know if It's for them or not. So this review is for people maybe on the fence. And sadly right now I would say avoid. While there is fun to be had here, there are too many broken mechanics or buggy mechanics. I do think this game has the potential for greatness, but CA seem more intrested in pumping out more DLC while ignoring broken things In the main game they sold us. I'm not even opposed to DLC, I think this game could really come into It's own once expanded with more factions and land mass. It's just a slap In the face to customers when they can create entirely new lores of magic, but leave the actual magic system broken for anyone who doesnt want to play with small unit size. The problem with the DLC is the price is pumped up and justified on things like mini cmapaigns which In reality are just zoomed In locked down portions on the map from the grand Campaign, stripped down and sold to us again.  Sadly I have to say give this a miss at the moment until fundamental pillars of the games like magic are worked on and the game is fleshed out more or you can bag it with all of the DLC In some sort of sale.",

It is clear that races have been held from the game with the intention of making us pay extra for them. They even did that from launch with Chaos being held back unless you pay up, all Total War games since they got into that faction-dlc craze at least gave you the main factions from the time. Making chaos a paid dlc is like making the Mongols in Atilla:Total War a dlc.  Now it's evident that Warhammer can work with strategy games. It is a tabletop strategy game. But it does not work with this strategy game. Any fighting just devolves into a melee moshpit in the center of the map with heroes striking each other repeatedly until the main body breaks and the artillery is slaughtered. The game was designed for 'arcade' style playing which means battles are over in five minuites and the whole battle system devolves down into whoever has the best army regardless of the skill level on either side.  Just to summerise, Warhammer:Total War, poor attempt at a Warhammer game, poorer attempt at a Total War game and riddled with expensive DLC.

'you shall not pass!!!!' since the 'end turn' button si frozen. nothing you can do but cry.  and guess what ?? the bug is known for couple month now.. did CA and SEGA do anything about it?

Creative content, fun game mechanics, etc. However, I highly advise against buything it for two reasons:  (A) First, there is a game ending bug that prevents you from completing the campaign. Its been all over the community threads for weeks, and CA has simply ignored. Happens when Chaos first arrives. Nothing worse than sinking dozens of hours into a game, only to never see it finished because of sloppy code. Extremely frustrating!!!!  (B) Even if the game did work (it doesnt) it seems WAY over priced for the amount of content provided, and further insults you with ABSURDLY priced DLC.   As it stands, its a $20 game, and that's if they include the DLC.",

I played Warhammer online where you had to buy the game and subscribe 15-20$ / month. I played it for as long it has been active. It is still my favorite game of all times, i miss it.  I played pretty much all Total Wars except Napoleon and Atila. I still play them when i feel like it.  This opus is an insult to both fanbases. I played the greenskin campain and loved it. Greenskin was my army on table, i love them. The game looks great, the concept of total war is amazing and the world of warhammer is just mindblowing but that is where it stops.  Count with me :  100$ For the main title. 10$ For a Race that kicks your ♥♥♥ in the campain wether you bought the DLC or not... in short, for content that is already in the game. 5$ For blood ... in warhammer/total war/21th century war game... seriously... shame on you. 20$ For 1 New Race... 20% (1/5) of the price of the main title for 1 race.  and if they go all in Warhammer, the following races are still missing :  -Bretonia -Skavens -Lizard men -Chaos Dwarfs -Dark elves -High elves -Wood elves -The Ogres  Also note that:   when they say buy the Chaos faction, they are selling 1/3 of the actual Chaos branch. The Beastmen are an other 3rd of it. So they splited the chaos in 2 different DLCs so far, the Deamons of Chaos are still missing, unless you consider the very few units to be 2 factions merged in one.   The undead branch has 2 factions, so we should expect the Tomb Kings.  I hope you are smart enough to understand what I and so many others are saying here. Buy the game, it's fun, warhammer is awesome. But the business model behind it is an aberation and a scam.  Estimated total price without discount : 400$ give or take. Are you that rich ? It is getting ridiculous. Watch piracy come back big time in the next 10 years.",

            "review_text": "Okay so firstly I`ve been a fan of the total war series since the original Shogun so I`ve had a fair amount of experience with the series and enjoyed most of the games. If I were to rank them in order of best to worst, Total War: Warhammer would probably be in the lower end of the table. Not to say it isnt a good game by all mean it is. There are however some issues I personally have with it others may disagree however with what I`m about to say but this is what I feel is wrong with the game -   1) Okay so firstly I`ll start off with DLC which a lot of poeple have isssues with too. Namely the pricing and the content of said DLC. So the prices are for the DLC are pretty damn high for what they are and personally I`d reccomend waiting for a sale before purchasing them. However this isnt my main problem with the DLC`s, no that belongs to the content of the DLC`s. You start off with only 4 playable factions (However I should note that they all feel unique to play and have their own styles of play) which for me is poor for a £40 game. You can play either the orks, empire, dwarfs or the vampire counts which is nice, but you cant play as chaos without buying them and to mean that is just bs. The game essentially revolves around preparing for a massive invasion by chaos which in my opionin makes them one of the most important factions if not the most important faction in the game, but you have to buy them (I know right, the ♥♥♥♥ CA?) oh and if you want blood and gore graphic you gotta pay to unlock that too. Thats all I say on DLC hopefully you got my point.  2)Are the units balanced? Simple answer no, no they`re not. However there are mods to help with this (yay for modders much love guys and gals) so until CA sort their ♥♥♥♥ mods will help. And due to this balancing issue I feel as though it takes away from the tactical options players can employ for example to beat a stronger army if yours is slightl;y weaker.   3) Is the ai still dumb as inbred rock? eh pretty much, and I`ll give you an example I was playing the vampire counts againts the empire and within my army I had a vahgulf (i think thats how its spelled, not sure i called it cuddles) now my vargulf was getting pretty low fighting some reiksgaurd cavalry so I pulled cuddles back, instead of chasing down and killing cuddles the ai instead decided to charge its cav into my spear units allowing cuddles to regen all his health and then proceed to violently slap the enemy to death once back in the fight. This ai error secured a win for me from an uncertain battle. However again there are mods that can help with this (modders 2 - 0 CA)   4) I`m not sure how others feel on this but I think the campaign map is too small, all though that is just my opionin and theres not much else to say on that.   5) This game also misses out a lot of content from Warhammer lore, most notibly for me are the factions that are completely missing from this game, which for me take away from the whole experience I`ll list quiclky; Elves, Dark Elves, Skaven, Chaos Dwarfs, Tomb Kings, and the various cult of chaos (there may be more but thats what I can remember).   However despite these shortcomming the game overall is still pretty good, a cash cow but at least not a bad one. It is still a fun a game with a lot of cool new features e.g. after capturing a settlement it will have certain features that relate to your faction. I would reccomend this game but not for the current price, especially with the DLC`s. I would rate this game 6/10 without mods and a 7/10 with, which is a shame because it could have been great but greed seems to have infested CA within the past few games. This was my first review so I hope it was helpfull if not....soz I`ll try better next timne or not or whatever.  If you didnt find this reveiw helpfull or I missed anything leave me some feedback and I shall try to corrrect that.",

I hope CA focuses more on their own original productions instead of Games Workshops broken table top game and does not get any more licenses. Warhammer is the worst fantasy world they could have chosen. Frankly they should have created their own fantasy world from scratch instead.  Problem A: There are no faction based preset formation nor does it have formation options (remember the 'Swooping Crane', 'Reclining Tiger' formations in SHOGUN2 TW?). Problem B: Units are fatigued for ever!!! Even the skirmishers are tired forever, nothing is resistant to fatigue. You thought Atilla TW was chaotic? No that ♥♥♥♥ was orderly and armies predictable. I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fugging Brettonina yoman mounted archers standing still forever so they would recover from exhaustion, but NO THEY WOULD NEVER EVER RECOVER FROM FATIGUE. Problem C: It is based on Warhammer which is intrinsically imbalanced, amateur, it is not assymetrical warfare, period! Problem D: You better use guard mode on your entire army, or else your carries will chase the enemy bum units to the map's end while your tanky and support units get smashed by the enemy carries. Problem E: There is no Orkishly possible way to counter Empire cheese of a steam tank, outriders with grenades, lancers and Karl Franz+Light wizard gayness that I could think of.  In conclusion I sincerely cry over my spent money on this trash, IF YOU WANT SINGLE PLAYER LIKE THE NOOB YOU ARE FIND A PIRATE COPY. MONEY IS ONLY WORTH SPENDING IF THE MULTIPLAYER IS GOOD.

As the Vampires, you're really only up against the Empire provinces for most of the game as Dwarfs and Chaos ignore you, Orcs won't do anything until way into the game, and Bretonnia is a joke. And I mean... you can only conquer a certain few settlements meaning conquest is limited pretty much just to humans which are very straight-forward, pretty much the same low-level armies all the freaking time.  When you get down to it, Total War: Warhammer lacks the variety that the Warhammer series has. Even with Chaos as a playable faction (now what, $8?) - it's still lacking because most units are just the same units with different weapons. I was so disappointed to find that half of the entire unit selection was just Grave Guard - Grave Guard (with great weapons) or Quarrelers - Quarrelers (with great weapons.   And I don't think I'm saying enough about the campaign. BORING AS HELL! And when you get into the parts where all Chaos declare war on you, it's just annoying to be honest because you can't kill them, and if you conquer all the way up to the Chaos wastes, you just leave an army or two to fight them every few turns, and before long, near the end of the game, you're really only playing with two armies tops because the rest are sitting in one place, reading for the bland and unending army of Chaos or their tribes to come hit you, or the Greenskins down in the south because the Dwarfs pretty much always can't beat them. And then what? Boom, public order problems across the board, so you just camp for twenty turns or so, and then maybe, just maybe the Dwarfs want to fight, and you have to go pull off an army to come clean up the mess. I mean, that's all it is, really, like cleaning up a room for spring cleaning. It's tiresome.  I've played Total War since Medieval, and I was so excited for this. I was unsure at first because of the BS that's always pulled, but then I saw some videos and my mind was made up because I thought the variety you see in some multiplayer videos are what you'll see in the campaign. Oh how naive I was to think Total War: Warhammer wasn't going to be a problem.  The worst thing is, this isn't something you can really fix. The campaign was screwed from the start, and even with new playable factions and greater variety in units, it will be just plainly not fun to play.  Kudos to producing a game that works at launch though. I can't believe I'm actually relieved with the fact that the product I bought wasn't unplayable. I'm so tired of being dissatisfied in Total War. I don't know what went wrong with you guys, but knock this ♥♥♥♥ off.

            "review_text": "I've been playing the TW series since their very first Shogun: TW game. Obviously it's not owned by the same company any more but I own every game in the series thus far. Warhammer is a completely different concept than normal TW games as it's fantasy and not loosely historical in gameplay. The base game is pretty decent, albeit missing a lot of mechanics of previous titles. Good mechanics improvements like cavalry and archer/gun units, they seem more viable to use in my armies in this game than the last. The map is large enough and has its own quirks in gameplay to make it so you can't be all powerful and roll over everyone early on.  Here is the problem with this game as compared to previous titles. The base mechanics are nearly identical to Atilla, and the gameplay is run essentially the same with the hordes. It seems like they reskinned the entire game to be Warhammer themed and shrunk the map to half or less than half of their previous title. It's a fantasy title with magic, monsters, flight......yet i feel like i'm playing a 60$ small DLC based off of Atilla. I wish they had made all sorts of new things gameplay wise but it's just build several basic buildings to unlock a few units and try to conquer your neighbor. There are extremely limited amounts of unique units, everyone has essentially the same types of units just reskinned with added/subtracted stats and amount of soldiers. This is a trend that has plagued the TW series for the last several releases where they just toss the same types of soldiers with different skins and stats for each faction. This makes the game pretty dull as soon as you get a few hours in since there's no diversity between any faction.  Currently 6 factions are available for gameplay, IF you bought the DLC for 2 of the factions. I remember years ago buying a base game that needed no patches for bug fixes and it also came with 10-20 unlockable factions. The current state of this series is DLC based for not a cheap price. I can understand maybe a dollar or two for new factions/mechanics but not nearly 20$ for a reskinned chaos faction with attributes from dwarfs/orcs. This is a quick way to get your loyal fanbase that buy every release ever to leave and never return. I am capable of spending 20$ more on a DLC but i refuse if it's a half-cocked release that only breathes the desperation for more income.   Take the current secondary and maybe even tertiary factions and make them more unique, make them free to play with unlocks through gameplay. Currently the only way i can enjoy this game is by loading it with mods from the workshop that add better scaling, mechanics and soldier types for each faction. The only way i can recommend this game is if the purchaser loads it with mods to make it closer to a completed game, and even then they're limited on other factions unless they dish out more cash.  I used to get thousands of hours of gameplay out of a base game, expansions not included and without mods with TW's older releases. Now i'll be lucky to get 500 out of this game unless i want to spend well over 100$ on this game plus DLC content that should have been included in the base purchase. The state of the game for me is currently play to mid to late game and get bored with it and change factions. And this is with it heavily modded, when it was the vanilla version i lost interest within a couple hours. Buy at your own risk and understand you'll have to be dishing out more and more money to play this game that should have released completed for 60$.",

This was the first total war game that crossed over into a Genre I enjoy.  I don't despise the game, but I feel some elements could have been done better.  Pros - I like that they put vampires in. I'm pretty sick of Orcs versus Humans in everything Warhammer, including 40K. People forget that other races exist in the setting.  - The war simulation is pretty cool with massive units running around beating each other up.  Cons - The war simulation gets old after awhile. I end up just auto resolving so many fights with the AI, which I'm thankful there's buttons for it. - War controls are not clear or when actions you do matter. I had to watch you tube videos of veterans of the Total War franchise to get any idea how fighting really works. Like being able to hold keys while dragging units to move them in formation. I don't mind a tutorial on HOW TO CONTROL ARMIES! - Autoresolve uses some odd math because any battle autoresolve says DOOOMED, you'll probably win if you fight it out. Now sure why they put it? - Kingdom management is as deep as a puddle. I have more fun with other games in the genre (Age of Wonders 3 for example) that allow a bit more depth. - One world map? No random maps? Modded maps? Nothing? - I must be doing something wrong with chaos faction DLC because these dudes take forever to build up. This might seem like a LEARN 2 PLAY NUB moment, but that's what tutorials are for.  Overall, Total War fans will probably like it, I think there's better High Level Strategy games out there.

This is because it is a Warhammer game first and a total war game second which really hurts the game in my eyes as a Total war fan.   This focus on warhammer has meant a lot of features have been stripped and the empire building in the campaign is linear and quite boring. Luckliy the large scale field battles are very fun due to monsterous units but even they have been damaged by streamlining. There are no formation types in the game at all meaning its hard to be tactical in battles and battles themselves are incredibly fast as well. Individual soldier animations are mediocre, all they do is swing a blade and this causes an enemy to go flying even if it looks ridiculous. Gore is good but looks stupid because the animations don't match where the gore is, eg like a decapitation even if they were hit in the stomach. It lacks the finesse and smoothness of Shogun 2's animations and gore.  Seiges are AWFUL. They are a shadow of what they once were and are boring because it always plays out the same way, attack SINGLE wall and win. Street layout is very simple and they vary little throughout the campaign. I'm being harsh on the game because i love total war and expect total war games to be more complex and tactical than this one here. The campaign map looks really pretty and there's a lot of detail, the lore is extensive and well written but apart from these points, i feel this is a lazy attempt from CA. I mean, the f***ing walls and towers don't even have a crumbling animation, they just disappear in a cloud of smoke which you can see through and realise :(. The lack of tactical depth in both battles and campaign, the laziness and crap animations for units outweigh the detailed world and the admittidly fun battles with monsters and wizards for me But then again, i am a TOTAL WAR PLAYER so this game will be fine for a warhammer player or a casual RTS player because my points will not bother them much. Oh and btw, multiplayer is bare-bones and no effort was put into that either.   Oh, and CA's/Segas DLC policy is BS and moneygrubbing so i won't be buying their dlc unless its on sale for a good price! :)",

If you want a foundation for what will eventually be a better game then feel free to pay $60 now, and over $60 in dlc over the next two years. I bought the base game and it feels incomplete, hollow, and dissected due to a lack of skill on the part of the developers, and due to greed on the part of the publishers. Stick to older Total War titles (they're amazing, other than Rome 2 and Atilla), play different Games Workshop games, but avoid this one unless you're made of money and enjoy incentivizing consumer-unfriendly buisness practices.

            "review_text": "So let's work out what this game is.  It's a faily standard Total War game. The building, army recruitement, agents should all be very familiar if you played any previous TW game. The obvious biggest difference is the fantasy setting of course, with magic, giant monsters, and OP heroes. It most certainly adds variety to earlier games with very similar swordsmen/spearmen etc. Factions feel different, and play different. The look and animations of the units is stunning. Another good point is that there are no useless 'peasant' units. Lower tier troops are weaker, but far from useless.  Now to the bad parts: 1. Battles are very short. Most battles are over in less than 5 mins. Even sieges take no more than 15 mins. It's annoyng as you cn't enjoy the main part of the game, unless you watch a replay in slow motion. To add to that, the lords and heroes and some units have abilities you need to activate manually every 30-60 sec, so the battle becomes a clickfest. 2. Campaign is short. You are really rushed in the campaign to deal with the plot driven big threat. It could be the great apocalyptic battle, but it just isn't. 3. Army movement. The AI in campaign is perfectly aware of your movement, including various modifiers, so loves to have his army just millimeters away from your max movement. and then force march away the next turn. It also seems to have a lot of free movement when retreating. Chasing raider armies typically involves at least 2 of yours to one of theirs and gets very frustrating. 4. Cities. Minor towns don't exist on the map. The battles take place on an open field. No, I am not joking. Also the default garrison of the town in 6 basic squads, so it's almost the same as being completely undefended. Armies are limited, so you cannot have a defence army in small towns. The only choice is the 'optional' defence building, which does add walls and more garrison to fully upgraded minor towns. This limits your town to merely 2 useful building slots.  5. Sieges. The sieges themselves are a massive letdown. You don't assault cities. You assault a short straight section (or corner) of wall with few houses behind it. Doesn't matter if it's human, ork, dwarf, it's all the same, only the look of the walls changes, the layout is the same couple of presets. It would have been somewhat unterstandable if it was some first stage of a multi-stage assault, but it's not. 6. DLC. I left this one to the last, because it's not my main problem with the game. It is still a problem though. 7 months after release the game has more DLC than the game cost at release. I really cannot see how this can be justified. The DLC does not add up to a new game, not even close. From the pre-release cutting contnent from the finished game (Chaos faction), to making elite easily recruitable units DLC (Regiments of Renown), this game is going in the wrong direction.  I really want to recommend this game, but not in the current state. Buy it in a bundle on sale when the full game is released.",

Cons:  No blood/gore on release - Come on... even if you wanted to suck me dry with DLC (on something that should be included in the vanilla game!) atleast have it available on release.   Battle animations suck - For the 2 hours I played this the battles were clumsy, kinda feels like old rome 1 where people randomly swing there weapons in the air and the guy adjacent falls down. After seeing What Rome II and Attilla have brought to the table as far as battle aesthetics go, I'm pretty dissapointed.   For example; Karl Franz is a one hitter but when he go to hit an orc with his hammer it looks like he's just hitting the air in front of the orc and the orc just falls down. I wanna see some battle animations darn it! Freaking Medeval II had finishing snimations!!!!!! ITS 2016!  Cartoony - I know some people will disagree with me because they like that art style or whatever. But I feel like I'm playing World of Warcraft. Clunky cartoon character portraits and GUI to boot. I wish it was bit darker and less WoW like.  Pros:  IP - It's Warhammer, and I want to love it.  Serious potential - With the new models and flying units, this game will be awesome.... eventually.  Runs well - For day 1, it runs smooth. Quick AI turns too. HINT: Turn V-Sync off if your getting flicker!  Conclusion:  1. I stopped playing this after 2 hours and wrote this review. (I don't write reviews)  2. It's going to be cool when we get a texture mod, blood dlc, and a proper radious total warhammer mod going.  3. Wish I would have saved my money AND WAITED. :(      ",

My main issues are:  Town battles exist only once you have built walls. You cannot fight in a town without walls it will just throw you into a field battle Animations are either lazy or non existant. There are no reloading animations for ranged units, there are no one on one fights or death animations, a unit of black orcs will just swing their weapons around randomly and sometimes an enemy will collapse dead, projectiles don't actually strike the enemy or their shields like in all the other total war games. Siege battles are super simplified. They take place on only a single angle or sometimes an L shape, the enemy starts in range of your towers no matter what, every unit besides cavalry and monsters can climb the walls because they all teleport ladders into existance when they read the walls. The epic cinematic experience of sieges is gone with this iteration of the total war franchise. And I know I already mentioned the pocket ladders, but they really are terrible.  Town managment is very simplified, you dont really need to make trade offs or decisions about what you want to build in 99% of your cities, the best thing to build is the same as every other town.

The whole DLC thing is a plague slowly killing TW series - while in Empire or Napoleon DLC really just added more units with medium-high usefulness in game, in Shogun 2 there were  no differences between factions initially  - you had to buy DLC with faction-unique units, which is utterly ridiculous. In Rome 2 the greed of publishers reached new heights - now whole factions had to be bought (no, I do not count clans from Shogun 2 as factions), and this continues in Warhammer.

The following features have been stripped out from the game: -No naval battles -No small town sieges -Cavalry units can no longer dismount -No bridge battles -You can no longer pick time of the day in custom battles, it's totally random -No siege escalation -No dynamic fire like in Attila -No more port assault battles -No more mixed naval/land battles  I've read devs and fanboys justifying this by saying that now every faction is unique and plays completely different which isn't true, for example the vampire counts which are supposed to be totally different , they play the same as any total war faction they just changed the name of the resource, instead of gold income it's now called dark magic or something like that but the means to produce it are the same as the mechanics in Rome 2 or Attila. Their units have an artificial morale, units don't route but instead they disappear 'disintegrate' in battle. They just changed the looks and name but for practical purposes every faction plays the same.    Technical issues: -Nvidia users will face horrible stuttering, even if you get decent frames per second the units stutter like doing a robotic dance. This issue was present in Rome 2 and was fixed, now it's back and more intense than ever.   Maybe they will introduce the missing features with DLC, I hope they do somehting like the Augustus FREE DLC in Rome 2 where they revamped everything wrong but right now as it is, the launch is on par or maybe worse than Rome 2 launch.   Don't bee fooled by warhammer fanboys, they praise this game because it's the only decent warhammer game they've ever had.  I would rather recommend you to go play Rome 2, Attila or Shogun 2. Those 3 games are superior to this one in every aspect. Only buy if you're fan of warhammer or prefer a fantasy setting to a real one.",

            "review_text": "Tl;Dr - If you're looking for a quick fix for your Total War itch, don't bother here. If you really dig the fantasy setting or already own the previous Total War installments, get Warhammer at a 50% discount minimum. This should have been an expansion back for Attila (price point-wise).  I know I'll get a lot of flack for not liking this iteration of Warhammer come to life in an RTS game, but frankly, it's not the idea of Warhammer I don't like, it's the implementation. Essentially I was pleasantly surprised to see CA go after the Warhammer franchise. A franchise that combines fantasy and the joy of medieval combat sounds like a dream come true, right? Unfortunately, the result is far from the truth.  Quite frankly, this game is a dissapointment on so many levels for me. While you can still get enjoyment out of it, especially if you are a hardcore Warhammer fan, that does not make up for the sheer lack of overall effort that shows everytime you boot a game up. But enough of that, let's get started with the usual list!  Pros:  1. The graphics - The game looks good...I mean...REALLY good. It has plenty of visual flair and charm despite my growing distate for the game as a whole.  2. Leaders - For the most part each leader adds a new and interesting mechanic to your battles, a nice change of pace from the political setups from Rome 2 and Attila.  3. Siege and Regular Battles - Regular battles have different visual styles that vary based on location, whilst sieges can certainly look gorgeous they also have MAJOR cons that we'll get to shortly.  4. No Politics/children - This one just speaks for itself.  And now, the Cons:  1. Complete lack of quanitity - So, remember when I made the jab at Atilla with 'Attila Lite' in my last review? Yeah, Warhammer is even worse, which you would almost think to be impossible. Now I get that there are only so many races, but dear gods, one faction per race? Seriously? And people try to justify that? Basically if you want to play coop with someone you cannot be the same race despite there being multiple factions per race. You also cannot play a different faction after you've grown tired of playing the exact same starting position with the exact same enemies around you. And no, different lords do not add enough variety to change that.  2. Great Power Debuff - This one just speaks for itself.  3. Agents - It was a pretty cool idea to have 'heroes' that you can use to bolster your army, such as using a Dwarven Engineer to increase the stats and reload speed of your artillery. Each hero has unique abilities for each race and you could really benefit from them in battle....oh...you say that the AI will only use them like agents from the previous Total War games and eventually you'll be dealing with the six or so agents from all your enemies that are completely unstoppable just like Attila? Well that was a waste of time.  4. Enemy Units Routing...Psych! - Yeah, this is probably the worst and most unrealistic part of Warhammer, a univese with gryphons (griffons?) and dragons. Picture this, you're in a close battle with the enemy lord, your troops have flanked his best warriors and you've decimated the enemy archers and horseman. Now all that's left is to bring this battle to a clo-....wait....why are my Hammerers dropping like flies? *glance around map for hidden units* Why the hell is that archer unit of only 10-20 men back in battle? ♥♥♥♥♥! How did that horseman unit of 15 come back and flank my warriors?! Yeah, get ready for this constantly happening. It's annoying and drags out battles for far too long. You'll constantly find weak units coming back. My advice? Don't even bother playing the dwarves if that annoys you. The Slayers are the only thing you'll have that can run down those units to make sure they don't come back.  5. Settlements/Cities - Wow do these look half-♥♥♥♥♥, just from the in-game ui alone. Do you remember Yu-Gi-Oh? How about Pegusus' Toon world? Yeah. That's pretty much what every city looks like from the grand campaign...toon towns.  6. Siege Battles - And now for the largest let down of all. I'm sure you've already heard of this, but siege battles suck. About 1/4 of the city is available to you, limiting your encirclment options to a head-on charge, Units pull ladders out of their hidden bags of holding, lodged somewhere securely in their rears, and when you get on the enemy walls? Yeah, your units get down by clipping through the battlements...Such a showcase of effort and time right there. But the worst part? The cities actually look really good, especially the background art. All of which just makes you wish for an actual siege battle like the previous games.  7. Siege Battles Continued - Settlements don't have siege battles unless you've builts walls. What does that mean? It means no more using choke points to your advantage on low level settlements, instead you get to fight on a generic battle map. I guess those budget cuts even hit your engineers.  At the end of the day, the best I can say about Warhammer is that it looks pretty. That it has potential. But sadly there's very little effort and quality here, especially when compared to previous Total War entries (Attila included). The lack of faction choices within each race is a sour taste every time you start a new game, especially so if you plan to play coop. Creatively, Warhammer is a step in the right direction for CA, but from a mechanic and quality standpoint it's miles behind Shogun 2.  9/25 Edit - Spell check",

            "review_text": "I have played this game for hours and hours. The only reason why I played this for so long was the Modding community. The Vanilla game is a pathetic attempt at a Total War Game. You received very few unit choices, unable to conquer the whole world and were limited on many other choices.   Now, let's talk Total War games. How many folks remember how awesome controlling infantry lines in Empire or Napoleon were? How about when you were able to control an alleyway in a city using your Phalanx's spear formation ability or a Pike wall? All those unit abilities and means to wheel right or wheel left with your units are gone. Now all units have innate abilities. Do you want to chose between fire arrow, heavy shot, whistling arrow or standard shot? That’s gone. Now they just shoot. Catapult want to shoot explosive, scatter or acid shots? Nope. Just set it up and forget about it. There is no micromanagement needed. All those cool units you made for specific battles or enemies are gone.   You can no longer fight in your small city should the AI attack. The battles are now in a field near no houses and no way to use the city to your advantage when attacked. So your garrison forces abandoned the town, rode out into a nice field for the enemy to slaughter there. Why was this removed? I loved the struggle of trying to save my city and not start it on fire in the process or I had to pay for the damage of defending in the city. Garrison forces are also not identified as Garrison should you have another army there. I used to give the Garrison units to my Co-op friend as they were expendable. He could lose all the troops and they came back automatically in the city. Terrible.   The AI will only attack you if they overwhelmingly will win a battle. Otherwise they will hide just out of your army movement range and never fight you. You can spend upwards of 10 turns chasing an army before you somehow manage to trap them using another army/armies or agents. It is really annoying. They will also only attack your city if it is 4000 vs 1 old drunk guy with a rusty spear. Which seems good in a sense, but there are very few battles I’ve found myself playing out because I either outnumber or they outnumber. It is rare to have a 1v1 fight that is even and requires my skills to win.   Want a navy? Nope...you get transport boats. The awesome naval combat of Empire and Shogun 2 (Fall of the Samurai) are gone. You can build ports, but they are just for economy. I don't understand the economy at all. One turn I am making 3000 and the next I am making 90 bucks.   Food is removed. No longer can you destroy crops to starve an opponent.   Heroes seems awesome on paper...then you fight a Chaos lord who is surrounded by 6 units of Dwarves with axes and winning….soundly. It will look like a mosh pit as the lord eventually pushes his way through the 2000 angry Dwarves and outruns everything on the battlefield to escape to fight another day. I’ve had many of battles that were critical to win against Chaos and once I trapped the lord, I had all units attack, I hit Triple Speed on the Battle Control and walked off to get a beer.   Where were the Elves? This is the first Fantasy game in history with no Elves...of any kind. Why no Bretonians? They are a hilarious faction.   Agents could be fun...I suppose. Granted, the AI will level up their Agent and then cause death and dismemberment every turn. Unless you have an equally awesome Agent, you won’t be able to kill them to you do. Want to convert or delay the agent? You can’t. It is kill only.   Diplomacy. Remember in Medieval Total War where you had to send a physical diplomat to an enemy territory? Not here. Every. Single. Turn. People will ask you to join a war against someone you might not be ready to fight. In Medieval I could KILL THE MESSENGER and my diplomacy screen would be blissfully quiet for awhile. It would hurt my diplomacy for a bit with that particular faction, but it sent a message.   Speaking of diplomacy. Remember how you could Gift Cities or Demand cities in Diplomacy? Nope. You can Declare war, peace, trade and that is about it. Want to marry a daughter off? What daughters? Want to send a son as hostage to secure peace. What sons? Just sling money around if you want peace/war.   Orks are warlike and have to be fighting or they take attrition. Or you can click the SUBDUE button and they are immediately fine again. Pointless.   Magic. This sounds awesome! Your Necromancer will be able to cast 1-2 spells and then he is out of magic. He spends the rest of the fight picking at his fingernails. Some mages were so useless after 2 spells I stopped making them. Now...the Amber Wizard is awesome!   Heroes. In the past hero units didn’t fight with you. They added bonuses to your army/city instead. Well, you can’t put a Priest in a city to convert them to your religion any more. You can’t force a rebellion. All Heroes really do are DIE. If you get a Fire Mage on a horse and then do Autoresolve in a battle you will notice your Fire Mage died and no one else took damage. Autorresolve will have your precious Fire Mage immediately charge HEADFIRST into combat and die. Constantly...never give a mage a horse. Ever. Unless you control every battle. I’ve had to remove my Mage from fights before as they had 24HP left after the last fight, but everyone else was at 100%.   All in all...this game removed so much from Total War games that I loved and added very little to write home about. I hope there are some serious updates coming or I am hoping there is a new Design team for the next Total War to bring back the tactical wargame I loved.",

Unfortunately the game is built around experienced players only.   The tutorial contains 2 videos that explain how the controlls work in the battle, nothing about how you actually should use your units. The in game tutorial is a very easy battle that you really don't have to do anything to win. while in game you suddenly discover heroes that cannot be killed by regular armies but can assasinate your general or block your path every turn making your life miserable. nothing of this even mentioned in the 'tutorial'. not to mention the computer almost always manages to get almost 2 times as much soldiers as i have at the location despite me having max army cap on the hero and all that on 'normal' difficulty. if you are new to this series prepare to dig into the guides and streams or youtube videos becose thats how you learn to play this game, really dissapointing...  Edit: after some learning(?!): 1) the game feels very linear in the research trees and building trees. very little meaningfull choise to make there and some technologies are just overal better than the alternatives. 2) one resource economy, rare resources are available but depending on your race you may not have any allies to trade them with at all. you can manage economy by just building a few income buildings in your provinces and not recruiting unneeded armies. very simple. 3) agents - the game is about agents not armies, they can assasinate enemy heroes and leader, kill their armies, prevent them from moving, and all that without even declaring war on them. to top it out they can only be killed by other agents so you must have leveled agents or when the computer brings his agents you will be helpless against them. watching how they murder your army.  verdict, very weak and boring for strategy lovers. if you are looking for a nice strategy to force you to think and customize your empire keep looking nothing for you here. if you like the series, warhammer lore and or simplified strategies you might want to check this out.",

The base game comes with 4 factions. The Greenskins, Empire, Vampire counts and Dwarfs. that's it, although Bretonia will become availeble somewhere in the future for free. However there are plans to include every faction in the game, and how do you get those? you guesed it, by paying a fortune. so far there are 2 factions that are DLC, the Warriors of Chaos which is 7,5 bucks (unless you pre-ordered the game, in that case you got them for free) and the Beastmen which comes with a special Beastman campain for a small fortune of 17,5 bucks. but thats not all. do you want gore in your game? that's no problem as long as you can pay 2,5 bucks. or what about new lords. a single pack will cost you 7,5 bucks. as of right now, half a year after release (give or take a month) there's already over 40 bucks worth of DLC and that's only a small portion concidering they want to add every faction. I'll definitly recomend this game to you if you're okay with the underwelming amounth of factions this 60 euro game has to offer because the game in itself is good, but if you're like me and rather enjoy a full game without having to take a morgage just so you can affort the DLC it's best to stay away from it.",

Terribly designed sieges lacking any strategic options. You can through men at the one available wall with no side gates to sally from. No network of streets to defend.  Small settlement battles play as field battles.  Very limited building options with none of the buildings having effects that need to be balanced by others.  Other than the five playables (plus Bretonnia) the other races use copy pasted Empire rosters.   Conclusion:  As a long time total war and warhammer fan I am very disappointed. With the amount of potential this game had/has it seems that CA has delivered a game without depth and is relying on modders to do the hardwork of making the game worth playing.  It is sad to see my favourite game franchise deteriorate seemingly because CA is too lazy to do the job right.

This last total war is disapointing,  First there is the despicable politic of CA/SEGA : paying 60euros for an uncomplete game, and 2 month after, seeing there are already 50 E worth of dlc (who doesnt add much by the way)  Second : the game is too casual : the tactical phases are good with the add of flying unit and magic wich allow more tactical depht.  But the strategic part is so poor... the province management and gov management is minimal, the general management is useless and the agents arent worth mentionning. Diplomacy is non existant.  Only good part is the modding community who is doing great things : radious, cataph etc...many thanks to them. But with every dlc, all mods must be rewrited,corrected , wich is tiresome for the modders and i fear they will give up on their mods.  ",

Thats extremaly expensive, and i dont know if i will be able to afford the dlc's if they will be priced like the ones that came out till now. This moment if you want to buy all released content for this game you would need to pay 102,44 Euro! THAT. IS. ABSURD. My question to the devs is. How much are you planning to make a final release with full game content included? Is it gonna be 300 Euro? 500? a 1000 maybe? Because right now ssituation looks like this:  You need to pay standard tripple A price for the game and the amount of content you get is hardly worth the price already. And When you run it you get hit in the face with payed DLC's that you would need to spent additional 40% of original games price on. . . . .  How is that fine in any way?  And i would be okay with all of that if you didn't try to sell the main game as a 'Full Version'. IT'S F****NG NOT! Just stop lying to people, be honest and add a word 'teaser' or 'demo' to the 60Euro product that you're selling and see how that affects your sellings, because right now this game may be fine, but i wouldn't give more than 30 for it and for 60 i would expect at least full product to be delivered.

            "review_text": "Because ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC policy, 20 dollars for a whole faction? Really? That's a third of a ♥♥♥♥ing game. Or a really good game from 3 years ago. Price gouging a basic faction and restricting it behind a paywall (pay to play Chaos, the main antagonists? ♥♥♥♥ off). And now they are telling us that we should pay the same price for Chaos, a whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ faction that should be there to begin with, to unlock a handful of Lords and a unit pack, which would be a couple bucks in any other Total War title. Since this is a Game's Workshop liscence (a company notorious for price hiking the ♥♥♥♥ out of their customer base, and one of the reasons my relationship with Warhammer is strictly through media), I highly suspect they are behind this.   So let's break it down:   The DLC policy: It should be made clear that this game isn't BAD per se, just unfinished, intentionally. This downvote is to protest this product and to recommend that any who didn't get this game as part of a free package (like I did) wait for it to be dropped in price, vote with your money, vote a lot less than they are asking.    Negatives: 1. Again, Chaos 2. Beastmen, holy ♥♥♥♥ Beastmen. A subpar campaign that looked like it took a collective afternoon to put together, units that are ripped straight from chaos. I understand the modeling requirements and whatnot, but with this games animation quality as compared to other total wars (more on that later), there is simply no justification for this much money. This would have been an excellent 8 to 10 dollar edition. Anything more is pushing it. Don't buy this, please, you are just asking for them to assrape your wallet in the future. 3. The upcoming Grim and the Grave expansion, its a unit pack, we'll get 2 legendary lords, a couple types, and 5 new units, only two of which will have anything unique about their models other than some particle effects. Other than that we have units that are simply stat and ability changes along with MAYBE a retexture, again, wait for half off to stomach this.   Positive: 1. I mean, they gave us Bretonnia, which is nice, I guess. It's a bit of a hollow faction, I guess it was a little too much to hope they would make them more unique after they were squatted for Age of Smegmar. 2. Blood for the Blood God, I'm giving the DLC a lot of ♥♥♥♥, but I'm not unreasonable, this is company standard and its not really that bad. It's more of a marketing tactic to save it from an M rating.   The Game:   Negatives: 1. A lot of the UI functionality has been dumbed down or eliminated from better Total War's like Shogun 2. State Management isn't as complex as it used to be, which I guess would be a positive for some, but I like Grand Strategy and things like Heart's of Iron, so micromanging my state and economy is my thing. 3. Diplomacy is still hilariously barebones, which is sorta fitting I guess, now that I think about it, but still, make this better. 4. The animation, frankly the animations in this game suck ♥♥♥ compared to the badass fight sequences of the modern Total War's. There is no unique anything, and it feels like each unit has maybe 5 attack animations for everything. So no Grave Guard vs Imperial Halberdiers with special mapping out and counters like other total wars, nor anything to indicate this is anything other than them swinging wildly. Honestly if this issue was fixed I could see justification behind the steep pricing in the factions. But otherwise, this is Rome 1 level of basic animation, and for all that this game asks, its an unforgivable absence. 5. Lack of key factions. Where in ♥♥♥♥s name are the Elves? Locked behind a 25 dollar paywall I bet. Lizardmen, Tomb Kings proper (which better not be a high price because they'll just be an extention of the Vampire Count's unit stacks), and Skaven. This is a negative because they'll be introduced at a ♥♥♥♥ton of money per faction more than likely, I'll edit this out if this proves false. 6. In my opinion the new siege weapon building kinda sucks, I wanna tow my own gear around damnit! Minor complaint.   Positives: 1. The unit variety is ♥♥♥♥ing outstanding, easily the most colorful variety of any Total War. 2. The AI is a lot better than most Total War's, and in combat I think the enemy even uses basic tactics now. 3. The unique character and characteres within each faction are awesome. I love how the Orc AI kinda just zergs in no matter the Odd's and how the Count's have endless horde's of expendable terror troops. The corruption system is a nice touch too. 4. Hero's are ton's of fun and a great addition. It also kind of lends you a badass with ton's of cool abilities to rally your people behind, much more fun than the calvalry on crack that was the generals of old. 5. Surprisingly balanced, coin per coin, which is good because everything Warhammer has struggled with this in the past (Fish of Fury, Necrons anyone?). 6. Even if a little bare, the questing system is fun and add's a much needed feeling of things being personal in your sprawling super Empire.   Overall I enjoyed this game, however I cannot spare it a thumbs up, in small part because of the negatives, but in much larger part because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC practices. Cut this ♥♥♥♥ out.   Though this has gotten me wondering if we could get a working Warhammer 40k Total War, what with the mass attritional warfare being par for the course in that universe I don't think there would be as many problems as a modern era total war would face. Though there would be some huge ♥♥♥ technical hurdles, it would be much more doable.",

Had to load a mod from the community to even make the enemy agents tolerable, then I was annilated by the opposing armies.  6. Would capture one city then immediately be attacked by two different armies and loose the city, my Lord and army. 7. Takes entirely to long to upgraded cities and the technologies.

            "review_text": "There are two main criteria this game should be judged on: being a TW game and being a Warhammer game. It fails both miserably (and the fact that there's so many good reviews out there only indicates and disheartening drop in standards in the game industry).  As a Total War game:  - Diplomacy is almost totally useless. The AI is even more random than previous game in the series, declaring war on supposed allies for no good reason while actual bad guys are rampaging all over the map. Meanwhile members of your own race (whom you'd expect to have a bonus with) won't even agree to a non-aggression pact, often enough.  - Town development is bland. Gone are the days of towns having an actual population (Medieval II, how I miss thee) and the varying level of development beign visible on the map. As a friend pointed out: you build farms in the beginning to spur population growth and when all the buildings are upgraded, you demolish all the farms because people don't need food anymore, do they?  - Tech tree has become bloated with useless minor upgrades that don't really do much. This has been a trend for a couple of games now, but with WTW it seems to have reached a new high in uselessness.  - Too many factions are COMPLETE copy &amp; paste jobs, without even the decency of having different skins with different colours on them. There's nothing mroe fun than watching an epic battle of white &amp; red empire troops fighting other white &amp; red empire troops.   - Sieges have reached an all-new low, with ridiculous insanities like mounted knights destroying castle gates by poking them with their lances; siege towers moving on their own vollition, while full of troops, to the enemy wall; enemies routign through solid walls; your own soldiers pullign ladders out of their pockets to scale the wals; your own troops subsequently refusing to come down said ladders when you order them to retreat; last but not least, you no longer besiege a city, you besiege a tiny corner of it. Epic, is it not?  - battlefields are even more bland than ever. Not a farmstead in sight, all you ever see are either forests and mountains or, well, just mountains. Occasionally some random ork effigy will show up, even if there are no orks around and you're just invading Kislev with chaos warriors.  - the animations are all the same. For everyone. All the time. Zooming in becomes pointless after a few fights. Not to mention some units don't even have a full set of animations (why aren't my troops reloading, ffs?)  - gone are many other basic optiosn like 'loose order' for troops being peppered by arrows, wedge formation for cavalry (beign unlocked by some tech doesn't count) etc. No idea why they couldn't be arsed to leave these in.  - some units don't even have their own sounds. For instance, the Chaos champion gets new soundbites when he acquires a chaos steed. Soudns that he keeps using once you switch from chaos steed to manticore. Buying some stock lion soundbites and putting them through an editor was too time-consuming, I guess.  - Lord &amp; Hero skill trees also feel totally bland and uninspired. +3 Armour when you already have 60 or 80. Big whoop. It's ridiculously sad if whenever you get a level-up with your character you couldn't care less because you can't be arsed trawling through the optiosn to find one that will actually give you somethign interesting.  - Characters can't lead units and have no bodyguards. In fact, no hero can in any circumstance ever be attached to any unit, ever. They jsut stroll aroudn by their lonesomes. CA compensates for this by givign them ridiculously high HP so they don't die to the first unit they meet. In fact, the complete opposite happens - characters wade through enemies like they'd be fighting toddlers armed with plastic straws.  - Hordes are usually cool. Until you create a fresh one after you already moved with the first one. Then notice the Horde infighting mechanic and how it will cost you almost 25% of your troops just for spawning a new general. GG CA!  - towns withotu walls disappear completely off the battle map. Not like you could use those narrow streets for defensive purposes, could you? Take a hint from the Jon Snow play-book and let the garrison juet run out and meet the advancing army in the open field.  - I could go on but by now I hope you either got my point or you're probably not reading anymore.  As a Warhammer game it initially seems cool and fun. But then after you play for a bit you start notcing many different problems that become worse and worse.  - Warriors of Chaos, the main antagonist, are only playable if you fork over more cash. No, the week 1 gratuity doesn't help. They should come with the basic game.  - Balthasar Gelt, the Supreme Patriarch of the Colleges of Magic, can't be appointed to this office when you start the campaign with him; instead, you can appoint random lords who aren't even wizards. Because who cares about the lore, right?  - If you choose to start the campaign with Ungrim Ironfist, the Slayer King of Karak Kadrin, you are still playing the 'Dwarfs' faction, still starting in Karaz-a-Karak (Thorgrim's capital) and Karak Kadrin won't even give you a non-aggression pact, doing their own thing in the north.  - Kislev is just a copy&amp;paste job of the generic empire race, with the exact same units and the exact same white &amp; red uniforms. Who cares that they're actually a cross between medieval russians, cossacks and poles, with their own style of fighting and their own lore of magic?  - Many other empire provinces, while they'd have different uniforms and focus on various aspects of warfare, are identical copy&amp;paste jobs of the generic empire faction.  - Runesmiths can, in this game, ASSASSINATE enemy characters. If you don't understand why this is stupid, I feel sorry for you. I recommend you grab some warhammer books off the interwebs and delve into the rich lore of this fantasy world. Then weep at the silliness that is WTW.  - There are no Challenge mechanics. By all the gods, even Mark of Chaos had Challenges. Not to mention it had skills designed specifically for challenges.  I'd like to write some nice summation of all these, but this absolute turd of a game is not worth it. CA have completely lost my respect.",

Huge load time, You can only play four factions ( five if you buy it). To zoom out, or in for that matter to zoom in, on the battle is slow and clunky. Movment on the world map needs tons for work, some times it makes no sense. this is just a start and I'm running out of room, other problem are in the diplomacy, battle mechanics, and the perceived “random” generator just to mention a few. I want to like it, perhaps as they continue to work on it and more content is added…. But for now I would not pay full price for it. Wait for it to go on sale. Games Workshop has the mark of Nurgle, everything it touches, it destroys.",

Armies have a small selection of units. The required general for an army systen is still in the game and sucking even worse than before; this would not be so bad if the battles actually lasted more than 5 minits. 20v20 battles all the time and they end in 5 minits, very boring and anticlimatic. Very limited person to person fighting, units like to randomly swing and the enemy falls down.

CONS: - Launches with a 'DLC' faction, likely the first of many such DLCs that CA/Sega will try and hit people up for 10-15$ at a later date with. - Launches with only a handful of races, and none of them really feel that unique once you're guiding them around the battlefield. - No Skaven, High Elves, Dark Elves, Lizardmen, Tombkings, Beastmen, Chaos is fairly limited. - Future DLC for all of the above to be released or not at all.",

But I think what really gets me the most is the lack of content, again. Only a few heroes? Great another games workshop game where they will want me to shelve out 50$ a month for their DLC. Customization and lore? Very little. You get “quests” that easily take away from the grand strategy. What kills me is that I wanted a total war game, what I got was a games workshop game.  Update since I gave it a real go.  - Every camp is EAF. The economies are still super easy to take advantage of and the AI are a joke. There is very limited content here. In my honest opinion I would say wait 3-4 years until they cram it full of 80$ worth of DLC that makes it worth it. This feels like a game beta.

In fact the quality of the animations and models reminded me of medieval 2 more than anything else, and pale in comparison to shogun 2. I dont have an issue with this per se as janky animations and poor model and texture quality do not a good game make, but if youre looking at the full 60$ asking price you better bet that comes into consideration. To be perfectly honest this game simply does not have the production value of a 60$ total war game.  The massive step backwards in AI group behavior, unit interaction animations, and unit diversity (in terms of model design), as well as lack of detail in battle maps and environments has left the product feeling cheapened and not worth full asking price. This is a shame as the concept was good, and implemented well.  I dont recomend this game for the price they currently ask",

And I mean massively bigger. I've not even got my proviences up to level 3 yet and they are sending in full armies. I'd be completely bankrupt with even one army that size.  I literally can't get any fun out of this game at the moment.....  Continued......  Well, managed to get a little further and discovered a wonderful little mechanic of the orcs.... They 'Waaarrgghh' which instead of been something sensible..... instead magically creates an entire second army next to their main army.....  So now Orcs are magical summoning creatures??? Come on this is really pathetic..... Not only is it a terrible mechanic lore-wise... Orcs just don't magically appear in the middle of eneemy territory, but game-play wise its even worse. You have one army which can easily win..... random chance, waarrrgghh happens, you are now outnumbered two to one.   Random roll of the dice decides everything, zero skill at all.   This whole game is just a reskinned Rome 2 with heros added. No real attempt has been made to account for the major universe differences (Orc 'agents' been safe in dwarf territory? Right.... shoot on sight... they can't pretend to be a dwarf but cos its just reskinned rome....)   I am really really disappointed in this game, it seems like Creative labs have really done an EA on us here. Absolutely minimum effort has been put into this to basically reskin Rome 2 into Warhammer. No real effort has been made to actually give the game any depth and so many of the mechanics are just really badly thought out.   Very very disappointed.  Cont 2....  Well I worked out the issue is basically the orc Waarrggh mechanic is so OP in the AI hands, mostly vs the AI itself, so basically the Orcs are massacaring all the southern dwarfs in like the first 5 turns and then having a massive empire + boosted heros to come straight at you with.  A few lucky battles and the orcs become pretty near unstoppable.  Basically most of the problems with this game seem to come down to a poor AI and poor economy. The battles themselves are decent as you'd expect from total war.  Other issues:  Items quests are placed far far too far from your homeland.... I mean literallly the far ends of the map. Not sure how anyone thought 'march your army to the middle of nowhere for 10 turns' was a good mechanic  Chaos 'end days' very underwhelming. I had just overpowered the green skins, managed to wipe out the vampire counts.... my armies start poodling north to be told Chaos has been defeated. I suspect again, an AI problem.  For end days, not even taking out the upper empire proviences is a bad mechanic. Losing cities is far too easy, happens far too quickly and the penalties can be absolutely massive, litereally, back to square 1 in one turn. Defensive garrisons are for the most part useless except at capitals.   The economy/AI is so bad, the combination means, any city that is razed, is never rebuilt. The AI never attempts to rebuild them no matter what so you get dead cities in the middle of empires.... Even at end-game levels, the AI has very few upgraded units/cities.   The 'underpass' mechanic is both completely OP and almost entirely based on a roll of the dice. Get lucky/unlucky and you can basically skip past all enemy defences. If you army can take all comers 1v1, there is no downside really. The fact you can emerge literally anywhere is just too powerful and makes a complete mockery of any kind of defensive armies, you can literally skip straight past them.  The 'uncompletable quests' is annoying as well, why on earth make it so you can't complete a quest because for example that faction has become a vassal of the empire?   The really sad part is, it wouldn't take much to make this into a really good game. Sort the AI out, move a few quests about to be closer to home, fix the economy and the underpass mechanic and you have a really good game.   If they do that in a patch, I'll change my recommendation.",

It's the story and the age in history and realisticness that made the total war emmersion so incredible. For me i could care less about the warhammer world or the story of it. If i had to choose some fantasy crap i would have prefered a lord of the rings total war over an organized nonsense board game from the 1980's.... I can't wait for the next title where you guys working at total war can come back to reality... too many workers from that generation at total war that forced this upon us... I grew up in the 1980's and any dude i seen that played warhammer board game was a lamo that got bullied and looked weird. I walked into the warhammer store when i got this game for the discount and that elf dude it came with it. when i was in the store those same weirdo people were there. trench coat wearing goth like super fat or super skinny in oddity type of people. it was like going back to the 80's i had flash backs and everything. blughhh.  PRO's: no latency or problems with shadows and the graphics are very well done. I only wish this was applied to attila or rome 2.... i have yet to find a single glitch. I run max graphics and this is the first time i am able to do this with a recent total war game. using the same computer playing attila or rome 2 it chuggs hard maxed out and shadows go crazy. playing warhammer i don't get any latency at all. very strange... extremely strange. it means they screwed us hard on attila and rome 2...  CON's: lame weird fantasy land that i could care less about and do not emmerse into. which really sucks. I get no joy from conquring lands that do not exist.... give me russia. give me rome. give me something relivent and relatable blughhh. I guess for people who were into warhammer board game they would love... but how many people does that appeal too. i would have thought lord of the rings was more popular than old board game of warhammer.... i hate the world and story total war picked.

Thoughout my experience with CA every product release was an utter disaster; They release under-developed under-tested junk to collect our money then figure out how to make it work later, this is not the case with warhammer. I spent many hours testing it before I decided to do a review.   The game had a lot of thought and tweaking that went into it. Graphics are silky smooth on Ultra Settings (I have a super powerful rig) factions, units, buildings are all unique, not the 'copy and paste' garbage we were used to. I can tell this project took them possibly atleast twice as many hours as the most developed title they released - if not more.  Other than a few minor cosmetic issues the game as it stands is perfect, I wouldn't change anything about it, I can't believe I'm saying this! But I'm impressed.",

If you want a good grand strategy game or the tactical battle depth of TW Shogun 2, buy this on a BIG discount or just stick to Shogun 2, Hearts of Iron 4, Civ 6, or Stellaris.  This game is to 4X and Total War what the new Bud Lites in shiny blue bottles are to beer: a watered down, ♥♥♥♥-poor experience that makes you think you'll love it at first, until you realize there's nothing of substance here. Whatever PM killed the idea of depth in campaign gameplay is full of ♥♥♥♥♥.  Overall, this is a solid single player game for your first 50-100 hours. After that, you either keep fighting the same repetitive AI, or you quickly burn out on the lackluster multiplayer.  Great flavour, fantastic UI. Chaos invasion really improves the pacing of the game, adding much needed challenge in the late game on the higher difficulties.  Graphics could really use some work. They're a definite downgrade since the early trailers of BlackfirePass or the Dwarf Ambush. Textures feel like a moderate upgrade since S2, but animations were far better then due to the matched animation system.  After you finish your first couple campaigns, however, I feel like this game is very lacking. Multiplayer is barebones, without any of the persistent elements (Avatar Mode) that made Shogun 2 so good. Maps are frequently imbalanced and relatively simplistic in their tactical challenges.  Battles are too frenetic and poorly paced, with little to no skirmishing phase and formations are overly simplistic. The sheer breadth of unit types in this game, the incredibly high rate of fatigue buildup, and the specificity of many of their counters forces you to use clumped formations that make reacting to threats easier.  Campaign management is shallow and often lacks meaningful choice. It's incredibly easy to apply the same min-maxed strategy everywhere, and the game doesn't present good reasons not to. Trade and diplomacy lack depth and sensible design. Infrastructure development and economic growth are non-existent, and population growth isn't leveraged in a meaningful way.  I think it says something when your turn-based campaign feels like it has less depth and interesting choice than vanilla Civ 5.  As a final note, I have mixed feelings about the DLC. I only wish they would upgrade existing factions' (generally shallow) campaign gameplay along with updating their unit rosters.  The Grim &amp; the Grave pack is necessary for being competent in MP (which is a total sham), and it doesn't have a new campaign like the King &amp; the Warlord pack despite being the same price.  WE race pack is great, fun mini-campaign (if obviously and obnoxiously scripted) and great to play in battle.  Beastmen DLC is pretty lackluster honestly, and unless you really want the race, don't buy it. It's just another 'Line em up, select all attack move' army in battle, and while the mini-campaign is somewhat interesting, it just doesn't provide a good enough experience to justify the cost. The fact that there's no Boris Todbringer campaign really rubs me wrong.",
