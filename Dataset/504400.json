            "review_text": "Feels like the photon variant of The Incredible Machine, nice enough. Seems to be produced for tablets (giant fonts, no keyb controls). But most of all, the game is not physically correct! (e.g. 'photon accelerators' isnt something that exists, and to curve photon paths, not gravity is used but magnetic fields). So if your kid plays this, (s)he might get some wrong ideas about the physics of light.",

            "review_text": "great puzzle game that based on real physics, on real optics science: you play with lasers, mirrors, prism, lenses; you rule photons making the lights turn on: levels seem to be endless and you need to be very precise on some levels, or photons won't obey you. Though game may seem a bit expensive - its really unique",
