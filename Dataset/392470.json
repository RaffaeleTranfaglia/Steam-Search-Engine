            "review_text": "UPDATE: I added a short FAQ at the bottom of the review, it is a good tl;dr if you have a quick question.  If you have ever played any of the romance of the three kingdom games, or nobunagas ambition games you must get this game!  However chances are you haven't since those series dont have many titles localized in english.   This game is quite similar to Europa Universalis in my opinion, but with many different mechanics. The combat however is somewhat more like Total War then like Europa. And there is just so much to do in this game! I think both players who aren't new to hardcare strategy games like Europa and more casual players who play the odd Civilization, Total War, or Dynasty Warriors Empires games will very very much enjoy this game.   I haven't experienced any bugs yet which is nice because a lot of the other koei releases as of recent havent been great for pc. From what I have gathered this isn't a port since it was made on pc first which is also great.  The create/edit officer this time around is very very indepth! I am still working on my first officer an hour in and am not even halfway done!  Personally I love the theme of this game, it has very beautiful artwork and music. The historical theme is very epic and has some really cool back story to it too. You can play from a historical scenario, or play the fictional scenario and do things your way. A lot of fun options to play around with to really make it your own when you start a new game.  While not as indepth as europa, this game comes close but is 100x easier and more visually appealing. The combat is a lot more indepth then Civ 5 as is the diplomatic aspects of this game as well. The game is very easy to pickup once you get into things!  You get to command units of thousands of troops led by unique officers who all have their own cool ability and tactics that can be used to put interesting strategies into action. You can even search for hidden roads and stuff to help you plan battles ahead of time.   Between managing diplomacy with neighbouring clans, fighting a war with another clan, trying to entice an enemy officer into joining my clan, developing my states and teaching my officers new abilities I am having a lot of fun! This was a well spent $60, I would definately recommend this to all my friends.  PS - For those of you who are curious this does come with the Power Up Kit (if you don't know what this means, in simple terms it's just more customization options and such)  EDIT: I wanted to update my review a little to answer a few questions. 1. How is the performance?  From what I've read people are managing to run this on older system, I have a completely overkill computer so I'm not sure myself what the minimum requirements would be to run this game however I have yet to run into any sort of lag or buggyness, I expect this game to be well optimized since it was made for the pc first (so not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port for once, thank you koei). PS I am on windows 10 64bit, i5 3570, 8gb ram and nvidia gtx 970  2. How is the combat system? Ok so I've said it was totalwar like, but that was a bit vague right? So not everyone has played total war so I will try and explain without comparing to total war. So combat seemed rather straight foward at first, it was like the classic rotk system where you kinda just sent your platoon out and watched them mindlessly kill each other. However things like passive skills, active abilities (which sort of activate randomly and can easily change the tide of battles) and stats like INT, VAL and LEA play a important role to winning battles. There was one thing that bothered me, instead of being able to freely move units wherever on the map, they are tied down to board game like routes called roads (roadwork can be done to improve travel speed). I was wondering why the combat felt like it was built on bogged down rotk mechanics. Then I saw this little button that would pop up over an units when they are enganged in battle, clicking it takes you into a war map with all currently engaged units that is more akin to the combat system of previous nobunaga's ambition games. This is where you can freely control your units, choose when to use your officer abilitys, use terrain advantage (barricades, turrets, etc) or even choose to seige the base (if nearby one) instead of enganging in direct combat. In this mode I have both completely wiped without dealing any casualties to the enemy officer, and have won impossible (etc 7000 vs my 3000) battles with the use of strategy. There are a lot of cool abilities and you can choose to engange in melee or ranged combat here. Horses can be used to charge the enemy with great speed and a high chance to confuse them, muskets can be unloaded which can also confuse the enemy, and you can use any of you adjucant officer abilities as well (depending on how much 'control' you have over your unit).  3. How agressive is the ai? There is a agressiveness setting you can change before starting your game, I have it set to high, so when I send units out the neigbouring states immediately send units to my border and draw close when I send them out to fight. Some times it is a bit frustrating, because often after taking a fort or so, it is immediately attacked by another clan, while I was still new to the game I lost many newly captured forts like this. It was quite annoying, this lead to me to start planning more intricate strategies involving split attacks, attempts to form alliances etc. What bugs me though is how handicapped you are if you decided to play the game starting with only 1 fort, you dont have enough labor to make any facilities and you are lacking in nearly everything, it's too expensive to endeavour in any kind of diplomacy. So here i found my self resorting to underhanded tactics (waiting for others to war, etc), and submitting myself to another clan (with this I get an ally and foreign income).   I hope I've cleared up most of the questions here, if any of you have other questions feel free to ask, I will try and update my review with answers to your question!",

            "review_text": "I'm reviewing this game from the point of view of someone who's a fan of Paradox Interactive games series (Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, etc) and also enjoys the Total War game series.   I've have no past experience with Koei strategy games, but needless to say, this game instantly caught my attention. Historical Strategy games that are anything more than wargames are few and far between, and this one looked really well done, and its made by a developer with decades of experience on this genre.  Most of the gameplay would fall somewhere a bit closer to Total War than to Europa Universalis. The turn-based aspects, and the way you improve each holding, are very reminiscent of the strategic portion of Total War games. The character with attributes, traits, loyalties and such also greatly remind of that series, and in a good way. The game pacing is akin to that of Europa Universalis (besides the fact that this one has turn-based elements).  The combat, despite looking slightly like TW, is very simplistic. And that's not a bad thing, it goes nicely with the game flow, and the mechanics that guide combat are tied to many other aspects of the game.  The game also has (historical?) quests for each clan in each campaign, giving a pretty nice incentive for replayability. Those remind me a little bit of the main campaigns from the Hegemony game series.  Speaking of the Hegemony game series, this game also has a Supply mechanic that is very reminiscent of it. Troops need supply, and they need to refill it periodically - you can't sustain a long distance war forever.  All in all, this seems to be a really solid game for those that enjoy Grand Strategy games.",

Cutcenes are dated - simple pictures with voiceover or subtittles.  2. Diplomacy depth - simple, no intrigue, in some cases I had taken towns from AI and yet their stance towards me was normal vs hostile. 3. Graphics - the main strategic map looks okay, but most other animation/graphics is subpar.  4. Battles - is there any strategy to them at all? It has been so dummed down a 5 year old could play it.   This game would be amazing 20 years ago. Times have changed, and Koei on many of its titles has failed to keep up.  Finally the price - ridiculous for what you are getting.",

            "review_text": "Nobunaga has a lot of interesting ideas in its game. It has supply, building management. Charector base military and polical exercises.  I want to give it a good review for the spying system alone as it's both realistic and often overlooked. Logistics and Supply are generally where I start differentiating between a casual wargame and a serious one and this one lets starvation fight your battles for you.  The problem with the game comes from its lack of depth in anyone of these feilds.  For example battles can be commanded in real time like total war, but only like 3 units with abilities based on the commander.  Generally when I see vassals I assume the game had put some thought into diplomacy. Unfortunatly, I think the diplomacy feels abitrary and the politics with the emporer lack options.  Production and management have options, although the effect of choices are not always clear to the player.  I actually could see a game in the series being one of my favorit games of all time. If the company flesh out the game a bit more. But, at this time the game sits selved in my library.  Clean up the interface and get some inspiration from Total War Battles, Crusader King Politics and Hegimony Logistics and Decisive Campaigns Briefing and this will be 50/10. The frame work is all there, unfortionally frameworks do not get good reviews. This game is not worth the $50 so I am forced to give it a negative review.",

            "review_text": "I was a fan of Koei's Samurai Warriors series as well as Paradox games like Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV, so I thought this looked worth trying out. And, boy was it!  Nobunaga's Ambition is a grand strategy game set in feudal Japan's 'warring states' period where Japan is divided into myriad little states ruled by various clans. In the game you choose one of the clans, and are responsible for internal development (building up your agriculture, building new city improvements, passing new government policies and so forth), diplomacy (building up strategic relationships with your neighbors, trying to schmooze up the Emperor, etc) and of course, leading your troops on a conquering spree across the Japanese plains, trying to unify the wartorn land. You can play as one of the more famous clans like the Oda or Takeda and have an easier time of things or you can try your hand at a tiny, one-province clan like the Shiba.  I would best describe Nobunaga's Ambition as a cross between Crusader Kings, a Total War game, and a JRPG. It has the conquest and dynasty building aspects of Crusader Kings and the real-time management of massive battles seen in a total war game. But unique to this game are cutscenes and quests, with the occassional melodrama worhy of a JRPG. These are great, and what really sets the game apart. I think Paradox would do well to have these little story moments in their games. And if you are a fan of Samurai Warriors, it is also awesome to see some familliar faces.  Overall, I highly, highly recommend the game. It is a bit expensive at the time of this writing, but I believe it is worth every cent. You will get hundreds of hours of enjoyment and an infinitely replayable game.",

From what I've played, you don't improve your units, and combat focuses more on your Officers and their Tactics than what assortment of weapon types and positioning you employ.  That said, Nobunaga's Ambition delivers a high-quality, well-performing strategy experience. I was very impressed at how smoothly and quickly the game ran. There is a depth to the characters that isn't too daunting. The soundtrack marvels the ears. And the clan creation feature is very neat.  It's just a very good game for this genre that's worth picking up on a sale and trying out.",

With all the scenarios and clans to choose from the game is as challenging as you want it to be, and you control as much as you wish to control.

I found it a little repetitive in the final stages of the game as I moved to unification. I like that I was able to choose when the game ended after I achieve the shogun status. It allowed me to achieve victory and then go back to expand upon the choices.  As the player, I felt a little over powered with the ability to use mass battles. I think allowing the AI to trigger mass battles if it masses a large enough army is a good idea. It changes the ability for me to create bottle necks of fights while bringing in large armies from around the area to call a mass battle once I have superior numbers.  I was able to eventually overpower a much stronger rival AI.   Overall a good addition to the genre if you like these kinds of games.   For new players, I would have a simple strategy. Make lots of allies. You have diplomats and treasure, use it early to establish local allies you can ask to support you in war. The allied battle component is a strong weapon. Use it.  I beat the game on max difficulty setting playing the first scenario as Nobunga's father then became Oda. ",

This is not an arcade battle game there is a lot of planning to make not unlike a civilization game. Don't expect to build customs armies and wreck Japan with your tactics, armies composition are statics and battles is mostly win by what officer is in charge of your army. The goal is more to create the right conditions to win than where to send my elite troops. An army whatever the size is a mob you can't really influence, not in a Totalwar style anyway. My big crush and i don't even remember the last title i can say that about : I LOVE the vanilla version. Unlike most wargames/strategy released in the last 10 years this one don't need mods to show its real potential. Honestly! I can't even think of good ideas about what to mods except remove cap for hardcore players.

The only things I feel are truly missing from the game are a more complex technology system like Iron Triangle had, and potentially more portraits for create an officer such as some of the much earlier games. These are minor flaws, and over-all this game functions FAR better than older Nobunaga's Ambition games.  One of the best minor additions is the concept of loyalty based on type of ruler, and it makes it harder to keep rulers or other offices you acquire that are opposed to your liege based on a set of modifiers. However, you are indeed more likely to keep officers as long as you maintain a relatively strong and consistent force.  Easily my favorite KOEI game yet 8.5/10",

I am a long time fan of both the Nobunaga's Ambition, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms games. We're talking since the NES era. A friend showed it to me, and all I could think of at the time was, 'what kind of names are those? How am I supposed to remember who's who?'.  Over time, these games opened my eyes to a type of gaming I haven't seen before. Managing many aspects of a country/empire. Things most games at the time didn't do.  As time has passed, other developers have taken the leap and joined in the crowd in this niche. Which is great. Game series such as Europa Universalis Crusader Kings, Total War, if you like those titles, you will like this game.  Anyways, about this title specifically. Last NA game I played was Iron Triangle. That game is tough. Easy to pick up the basics with a strong clan on easy/normal difficulty, hard to master with a weaker clan on hard. This game is showing me much of the same.  They have expanded on the domestic aspect of it. You now have to focus on improving roads to both increase trade income as well as troop movement. Planning out domestic district expansion is also key. You have to figure out if it's worth it to choose the expansion upgrade, or one that exploits what you have on that tile, and passing up the expansion (ex. You can choose an option that lets you get additional farming in the next tile, or you can forsake that to focus on lowering the cost of purchasing horses). That was a very nice touch in this game.  In former games, there was essentially one city per province. Now there are multiple cities per province. Again that opens up a new aspect to the game. Do you focus on food? Troops? Income? Innovation? A lot of strategies to employ even on the domestic level.   I've barely scratched the surface so far, having played less than 4 hours currently, but I am really liking this title. If you're a fan of grand strategy like Crusader Kings 1/2, or Europa Unversalis 3/4, you should get this game. There is no multiplayer, but there is an abundance of single player. More than enough to warrant the purchase.  EDIT  I'm now about 15 hours into this game. There just seems to be a new surprise around each corner. Now I can build new fortresses in my provinces, thus increasing my harvest/income/draft pools even further. Enabling the option that allows maidens to become officers adds another dimension. Some of them are best used to seal alliances, or raise an officer's loyalty. Others, become better than officers, so why not let them loose on the battlefied?  As far as content is concered, this game is a 10/10. So much replayability, plenty of tweaking of options, and yes, make good use of the in game encyclopedia.",

They do the job but there is enough there to actually make you think the game is pretty. The artwork in cutscenes is splendid to look at. The best part for me is the castles and how detailed districts look.   Sound - 6/10 : Meh. The songs are a little repetative and loud personally. They do not really provide any ambience and I found myself turning off the music itself. Voice acting is brilliantly done and there is a good range of voices that make characters feel different, which is good.   Gameplay - 10/10 : Halfway between EU4 and Total War. It doesn't have as in depth a battle mode and it doesn't have as in depth a grand strategy mode but it is a brilliant balance. It doesn't feel 'light' on mechanics. It has a nice spectrum of things to keep you busy each turn. The battle mechanics are a little clunky but it doesn't subtract from it.   Replayability - 8/10 : Much like EU4 and Total War, there is a lot of replayability in so much that you have access to all of the different nations from a variety of different starting points but it isn't that different an experience. It is repetative but if you play games like EU4 and TW it is the same situation as those games. There are feats to accomplish but these aren't linked to steam achievements which is a little annoying.   Price - 7/10 : Considering games like EU4 and TW, the price point is a little higher than you would normally expect but it isn't overpriced per-say. If you like these types of games you will most definitely put more than enough hours in to make it worth it and if you compare it to a game like EU4, if you include all of the expansions, then it is a pretty good deal.  I would really like to see it get some proper expansions or mods possibly in the future. This type of game in the European setting would be amazing.",

KOEI is already very famous because of Samurai Warriors, Dynasty Warrior and Warriors Orochi series, but few people do know about their great titles from Historical Simulations series like Romance of the Three Kingdoms (RoTK) and Nobubaga's Ambition (NA).  In this case, NA: Sphere of Influence tells the japanese history from the ascencion of the Oda Clan until japanese unification by Tokugawa. During the game you need to balance your actions in political, domestics and militaristics question, not forgetting to tell about all the others problems that may appear like, for example, treasons.  You have two options during the game, you can follow the hisical flow, learning a little more from the japanese history while repeating the same steps and decisions from the leaders from the time or if you want you can play everything on the fictional way of the history, trying to conquer and unify Japan under the flag from the clan that you choose or even in a clan that you have created.  One of the biggest problems from this game compared to others from the hitorical simulations is that, at least for me, this title is a lot easier if compared with RoTK, wherer I have played it since the SNES version and found more difficult in the IX, X and XI game from the serie, where you needed to do a better control and balance between the militaristic/diplomatic aspects of the game and needed to think a lot more in the combats where the weapon, general and skills available played a more important role in all the aspects of the game.  Finally, to finish this brief review, if you like a game with all these aspects allied with some strategy during the combats (that you can choose to fight your battles or only wait for a result) this game is for you. If not, stay away from the game and don't waste your money. If you want a better opinion, take a look on YouTube for gameplay videos and see for yourself.",

Pros: +Ambitious and beautiful game +Has complex character effects on your lands +Diplomacy seems to be multi-layered +Gameplay is fairly simplistic and easy to learn +Is designed like a boardgame so every action is balanced fairly well +Has good combat mechanisms built inside +Has a good story concentrating on Oda Nobunaga and is relatively speaking 'historically accurate'  Cons: -Not enough user feedback on your actions -Gameplay doesn't get complex at all and becomes quickly very repetetive -You cannot determine things like facing of your troops -&gt; Way too simplistic UI -Forces the story down your throat if you deliberately play as some minor faction far far away from Oda Clan   Nobunaga's Ambition is an overall a good game. It seems to include very complex succession mechanisms and character influences on your feudal fiefs. In that aspect it remotely reminds titels like CK2. However it doesn't seem to go all the way there when it comes to diplomacy.  What do you mean 'seems', you might ask. Well the game does its best to hide information from you. It doesn't give you that many numbers, when deciding who to lead your castles or armies or wether or not it has some hidden effects somewhere else. And you even cannot decide which way your troops are facing while in combat mode. Everything is so automated that you don't feel like you are in control.  It would be reasonable to ask 60 eur from a PC title if they would improve UI when they imported this to PC. Now it requires so much extra clicking to get that piece of information that you expect to find in non-existent tooltips. But as everything is so automated, you rarely need to know why things are folding out as they are. This game comes with a manual to explain mechanisms that you never get to actively use unless you really sit down and read it.  Its a good game but pricing is way out there. 30 eur would be more correct if the game wants to compete on its own price tag. It is not however a fully fledged and polished AAA product.",

            "review_text": "KOEI's return to Western PC market is hampered by icon-based menus and unoptimized UI. Recall back to Romance of Three Kingdoms XI and remember how most menus were presented: clear textual buttons telling you what does what. I don't need to hover over a button just to know what this magnifying glass over a mountain means. Oh well, next-gen ideas with backward implementation continues to be a demon that is hard to expel.  After going thru 112 minutes of gameplay, I knew I wasn't enjoying myself. The pretty map didn't provide an extra degree of entertainment and while I am guilty of abandoning the game on its early stages, I still felt the historical setting ripe with betrayals, display of loyalties and tragedies would be better served with a more 'officer-centric' gameplay similar to Romance of Three Kingdoms X.   I only hope this lack of success on this franchise does not mean KOEI is abandoning their plans for Romance of Three Kingdom XIII.",

            "review_text": "This game has quickly become one of my personal favourite games, I've previously played Koei's other game series including Bladestorm (both new and old), Dynasty Warriors (one of the first games I really played fully and have played every one since 2), and their Romance of Three Kingdoms series which could be compared to this. This is my first time playing any of the games in the Nobunaga's Ambition series and so far I've been loving it, its similar to total war games in a way, some things are more simplified and on the lower difficulties the AI obviously isnt that intellegent but they have custom options for difficulty that allows you to make the AI harder but not allow them to cheat in other aspects that a game would normally let them cheat in such as diplomacy, income, supplies, etc. There are also multiple things that can be done to help minimize the micromanagement as your clan increases in strength such as creating provinces, delegating cities so that development is handled by the lord of the castle, and a few others. There is also the option to follow along with certain parts of history through quests that you can choose to accept or decline as they come up in history, some people have mentioned issues with the AI interfering with quests by their actions but so far through Nobunaga's line I have yet to run into any issues caused by the AI. A few downsides that I believe would've been nice and that I had enjoyed in the ROTK series were actual castle defenses, battles near your castles are fought outside the gates with defensive turrets (if you've built them) and some log spear walls (both of which are destructable simply by ordering your unit to walk through them, it takes them a little bit of time however so it will delay your unit and towers will still fire while you are destroying them.) Diplomacy is also quite simplified through a trust system which just involves you sending an officer to them who will stay there till trust is at 100 or you order them back. One really interesting feature however is the ability to add up to 3000 portraits into the game to use for character creation. This option allows for many play throughs with different themed forces or even allows you to implement yourself into the game. The game looks very nice and isnt very demanding on your pc so low end machines should have no problem maintaining 30+ FPS which is very playable for a RTS game. Overall if you enjoy RTS games or have played any previous games of this series or the ROTK series then I would highly recommend the game, if you consider the price tag a little too high for the game then add it to your wishlist and hope for a sale (not that common with Koei games, but I personally don't regret my purchase of the game at full price.)",

            "review_text": "What this game does best is putting you in the leader ship role of the warlords of japan. It lets you follow the historic path of multiple clans, or of a clan that had no major part in history. The game also lets you make new custom characters, and to make new clans useing the custom characters. The best part of the game (in my opinion) is how you can follow history or make a new clan and change history or more accurately write history your self. But the game should have put in a system were the clans follow the historic path and let your custom characters marry eachother. But over all it is a good game, that i would recommend to anyone that likes strategy games or japanese history.",

The game of theirs that I first played, then in 1993, was Romance of the Three Kingdoms 2 for the NES. While Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence is not exactly the same game, and while there is in fact a new game in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series for the PC, it nonetheless provides a very similar experience; one where troops move, and battles are fought, in a very realistic manner, and one where diplomacy is a useful, necessary part of one's strategy as a warlord. Koei Tecmo games commendably recreates history in its games in my opinion.",
