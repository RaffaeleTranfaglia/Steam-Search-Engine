It was really weird.  Final verdict: Try it out, see if you like it. If not, it only takes a few minutes to download and only a few seconds to uninstall. It's a good screensaver I guess.",

I played it thinking I might feel relaxed after,  instead it just made me frustrated with the lack in information.  So it just made me really irritated.

It meant we could talk about eco-systems on a very basic level that he could understand - even if he did have a bit of an obsession with adding pike that did make it a little difficult. It's easy enough for him to control too and the graphics and background music are very relaxed and soothing. Great for a free game.",

But due to the lack of complexity of this game to change ph levels and to further change O2 levels, I can partially enhance the growth of algea in the lake to sort of begin the process of eutrophication. Overall I was unpleased, but I can't say I hate this game. It's too casual, and I should have known better. This game does have potential, just needs more added features to it. Look up eutrophication for those who didn't take an Environmental science class in high school, the process is crazy and sadly is commonly found in lakes across America. I sorta recommend this game to the casual players who love otters.  The otters are cute and real. RESPECT THE OTTERS",
