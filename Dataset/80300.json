The voiced banter between the human characters is quite enjoyable, and there's TONS of hidden writing and dialogue.  It's a short-ish game (could take you like 4 hours I suppose) but it's a charming game from start to finish.",

Also it's a bit boring to have to move all the robots, the same problems as Lost Vikings, but not quite as lively.  It's worth pointing out that this a sequel to a freeware game with identical gameplay and equivalent length. I would recommend playing that first.",

If there is anything this game did right, it is proper humor for the casual audience it is intended for. The story is pretty well written for a short game, and the voice acting is spot on. The one thing I did not like in Puzzle bots was the non-existence of hints of any kind. Some of these puzzles were super elaborate, so in some cases it will be a guess and check ordeal too see if the you are solving the puzzles correctly. Overall it was very difficult to find any fault with this game, other than the fact it probably won’t appeal to the “hardcore” audience.",

Like other reviewers said, it's definitely a kid's game, and it's not perfect. But it was cute and would probably keep a kid entertained for ages. Plus, the robots themselves are really dynamic, well developed characters with interesting animation, even if the people aren't.",
