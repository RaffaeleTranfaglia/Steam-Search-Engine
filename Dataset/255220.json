            "review_text": "Codemasters had a plan when they rebranded under the Codemasters Racing Studio banner. That plan was to have the GRID and Dirt franchises to release a game every other year in syncopation. This started with Dirt Showdown, followed by GRID 2. However, Codemasters have abandoned their plan after only a single iteration. Possibly in part to the release of the next generation of consoles and the learning curve required in developing for the new platform, but ultimately it can be put down to the fact that GRID 2 received such a mixed reception from the fans. No cockpit view? A story driven racing game? What were Codemasters thinking?  So what is GRID Autosport then? Codemasters claim that the “time and technology were right” to release another version, only a year later than GRID 2 had graced our shelves. What the fans really think is that GRID Autosport is an apology for GRID 2. One thing is for sure, it’s a fine game.  Codemasters went to a lot of effort in listening to their fans. One of the biggest gripes of GRID 2 was the lack of a cockpit view. Well GRID Autosport has two of them. Codemasters reason for leaving it out of GRID 2 made a lot of sense, saving on resources that could be better used making the rest of the game beautiful, something they definitely achieved. So while GRID Autosport has brought back in the cockpit view, it is relatively low detail, with no sign of dials or monitors anywhere on the dash to provide feedback to the player. This is still a bit of a sticking point, especially when the player is encouraged to play without any UI for an extra XP reward bonus each race.  The difficulty settings are pretty much back to the way they were in the original GRID. You get a set XP reward from your performance during a season, and this can be enhanced depending on the difficulty settings you pick. Not just the level of the AI, but driving assists, forcing the view to cockpit only and driving with no UI all help raise your XP bonus. It is rather key then that with the low end internal view that Codemasters provided some further form of feedback to the player. This is done in terms of a race engineer.   In previous games the race engineer came onto the radio when the game felt the need, start of every lap, after a bad crash etc. In GRID Autosport you can request information from him at any point. Your position, your team mates position, your rivals position and a damage report are all just a button press away. This works really well during races, but Codemasters have still slightly missed out here by not having it available during the timed events or qualifying sessions.  A gripe of mine when it came to GRID 2 was the forcing of multidiscipline play. The GRID series has its origins set from the TOCA Touring Car games, and it has always been what they have done best. GRID Autosport goes some way to correcting this by getting rid of the whole story based driving idea and focusing a lot more on circuits over open road tracks. The selection of tracks is not huge, twenty two locations combine to provide over a hundred different track layouts. There are a couple of new tracks in there, but the majority of them are old favourites.  You can race on these tracks across the set disciplines available in GRID Autosport. These are Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuner and Street. The set up is a lot more like the original GRID where each season you pick a discipline, then select an event from that discipline to race in over the course of that season. Each event category will give you a couple of driver offers to chose from, with season objects set and XP rewards in that discipline for completing them. Once you reach level three in all disciplines you unlock the first of the GRID Championships.If you chose to complete a GRID Championship season you will compete across all disciplines, but the season objectives will be challenging yet rewarding. These are probably the best way to boost your XP across all the disciplines.  However, if you are like me then you will prefer one or two disciplines over the others. In fact, I see no reason for some of these to be in here at all. Tuner, for example, is mostly filled with Time Trial and Drift events. Who plays these? The Open Wheel discipline is nice, but all it does is make me look forward to the next F1 game. I wouldn’t be upset if these two categories were not in the game. Street is good, it has been a strong part in all the GRID games, though the loss of Live Routes is a shame, as it was easily the best feature in GRID 2. Endurance requires a lot of skill, with the minimum length of races being eight minutes and tire wear playing a huge part in each race.   Endurance racing is very much about consistency, and it’s the discipline where you see AI mistakes more than any other. Touring is the bread and butter though. I’ve already mentioned that the GRID roots are in the TOCA series, and to be honest, I’d love to see Codemasters go back and make a pure TOCA game again, and I don’t think I’m alone.  The multiplayer side of the game works off the same experience system as the single player, with every race providing you with XP in the selected discipline. To begin with you will be loaning a car in each race you enter, but once you own a car you can start competing with it if the right events show up in your playlist. Codemasters have gone to a lot of effort to make the online experience a lot more personal. You can customise cars you own in terms of livery and sponsors, but each race also earns the car XP which will unlock upgrades for it.  Overall GRID Autosport has taken a step backwards, but in a good way. One big shame in single player is that you never form your own team like in the original GRID, picking the livery and sponsors. You are just constantly a driver for hire. The discipline system works well though, and if you are not bothered about the GRID Championships then you can just stick to what you enjoy.",

I know I know, you have a steering wheel, but GRID is a fun-to-play racing game, if you try to play it as simulation game, you will dispoint. - Game design is rubbish, both singleplay and multiplay is messy - NO team management in the singleplay, you are a hried driver, you can't choose car, livery, upgraed, teammate, so I first thought maybe GRID:Autosport is focus on multiplay...boy was I wrong - Multiplay is lack of creative, finding new race is difficult, the only way I can play multiplay race is invite my friend... - The orginal GRID is great mostly becasue it's creative, back then, every race track in other racing game has only fixed time of day, so you can imange how amazing when we first saw LeMans 24 hours race in GRID with shifting time of day, and then you can understand how dispointed when you find out 'Endurance' seriese in Autosport is just runing in a night version race track, when every major racing game has change time and weather as standard...hopelsee",

            "review_text": "Dear fellow players. I have just bought this game recently and in my opinion it is amazing. The best thing to mention is that the game focuses on the player only, you do not have to go through a boring career method, you can freely do the events as you would like to.  The game has really wide range of motorsport genres, you can find almost everything what you like, including drift, formula car series etc.  The gameplay, with the RPG elements also fantastic. In online games, you will start the game with a loan vehicle, which are the slowest one. As you progress and earn money for racing, you can finally buy your first car and upgrade them through your online career. As soon as your car is leveled to the highest level, you will experience some really difficult and enjoyable races online.  The online community is also good, the game has an “impact rating system”, which means if you make an impact with other players, your rating will be lowered and you will be temporarily banned from some of the events which has impact rating enabled. If you would like to improve your impact rating, you need to drive safe and look out for the other racers and stay away from impacts at all costs.  The mixture of arcade and simulation style is also a good idea, it is not easy as an arcade game for example Need for speed series and it is not that difficult either. You need to have some skills, if you would like to finish in the top places, so the challenges will last long enough to play lot of hours.  Only two negative thing to mention. The first is the blurry HUD, which is painfully awful. I do not even know, why codemasters did not do it perfectly (they do it right in the first GRID). Secondly, the silly AI is can be really annoying. The system did not even notice whether I am on the track or not.  Altogether, a game which is really fun to play in my opinion and I will play many more hours in the future. Hopefully, the negative problems will be solved in the future through a patch or something. I am really recommend this game, if you are looking for good competition, it is an 8 out of 10 for me.  I am really looking forward to see you soon in my rearview-mirror! :) ",

            "review_text": "I bought this game thinking it would be completely different than the other games in the GRID series. The 'authentic handling' as stated in the description caught my eye as GRID 2 was all about drifting every single car around corners at crazy speeds. I was very disappointed to learn that nothing has changed. This game feels like GRID 2 with better graphics, the same drifty handling, and the same waste of money for someone looking for a, 'authentic handling' or simulator experience. This brings me to the controls, I'm sure the game is manageable with a controller or even a keyboard and mouse, but with a wheel like a G27, good luck. The shifting, should you choose to use a manual transmission with a clutch and H shifter is horrid, cars pop out of gear at random times and most of the time you can't put the car back into gear because the game simply won’t recognize it. All in all, the game isn't what I was looking for and Codemasters has only given the series a new set of pretty textures and not much else. If you liked the other GRID games, by all means this is nothing different but if your someone looking for a sim experience I recommend you look into Race 07, and Asseto Corsa and not dump $50 on this game like I did.",

            "review_text": "So yeah, another GRID game. Please note that my opinion is based on Linux version' experience.  A bunch content from older Codemasters games. Apart from visuals and other whistles and bells, I feel that circuits like Istanbul Park or Hockenheimring haven't changes at all, for worse, and more importantly, better. They are just the same.  Graphics are nice, although I suspect that Linux port lacks few effects. Handling is not arcade-like, but still makes you think sometimes that first GRID back in 2007 was more realistic. But the only REAL issue is that this will be probably another Codemasters' racing game you'll never beat -- there's so much old content that you'll probably get bored halfway.  Nevertheless, thumbs up. There's very few racing games on Linux whatsoever, and this is definitely not a bad one.",

If you are a fan of race sims and use a wheel then I'm afraid this game is a waste of money. In single player mode the AI just smash the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and it's even worse online. The game is infested with joypad players who are just zig zagging all over the track and don't seem to realise that the idea of the game is to try and pass you fair and square. However, what your sadly presented with is a community full of 'smash to pass' players who don't seem to have any grasp of the words 'Gentlemanly Behaviour'. I've done several online races now and there doesn't seem to be any penalties for contact but theres plenty of penalties for clipping a corner a SMALL degree (With two tyres still on the tarmac and inside the white line). I'm sorry but this is just another GRID with the same old churned up ♥♥♥♥♥ with additional cars and tracks (Most of which have been produced for their other games such as the F1 series) which has been produced for the chavvy masses to smash the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other.   Oh, the graphics are excellent but the interior views are all blurred out as they couldn't be arsed to go into detail....another ♥♥♥♥ part of this extremely poor game.   4/10 - I've had more fun having teeth pulled out.",

It still feels like multi player, but you just are not racing at exactly the same time. You are posting times that your friends compete against.  Overall though- well worth the money!

            "review_text": "I have played more racing games in over 20 years than I could ever remember. While not the worst racing game I have ever played, It is a long way from the best. Controls and handling of the cars is not really an issue except to point out that keyboard players should expect to be at a disadvantage. The main problems are the AI, the lack of visibility and the atrocious in car view. The AI is following the same principle that has been used for a few years now. That is they are 'heavy' meaning you cannot ram them and expect to see them suffer much. Unfortunately that the same does not apply in reverse, and you will often find yourself losing many positions or even out of a race after being hit by the AI. What make it worse in this game, is the AI generally doesnt see you or care. They will maneuver to overtake on a corner, then switch into your lane after a few seconds, regardless of where you are. This only applies if your are not drift/sliding around the corner. In this instance you do not exist and that will blindly drive right into you. If by chance you get t-boned and stuck on the front of thier car, then race over. They will not stop to let you off, and will happily push you as far off the track as they can go before hitting a wall or running out of momentum. Visibilty in this game is not something you will notice much as the graphics are quite nice. The problem does become apparent on the more technical circuits though. The issue is you can see a lot of scenery, but very little of the road ahead. In many places the corners are hard to judge as you can not really see a far as you should be able to. It is like an artificial limit on the draw distance. Using the best line feature can help, but if you cannot see much of the road, you wont see much of a line on the road either. Now for the in car view. Its there.... partially. This is absolutly the worst view I have EVER seen in a car game. Not only do they further restrict your view by making you feel like you are to small to look over the dash, but the whole interior of the car is blurred W...T...F!!! Bonus xp for limiting views to incar only, but not worth it.  People who played Grid 2 online are in for some good news. You can buy quite a few cars in this game without having to play online for 100hrs. Bad news is there are now something like 50 catagoeries, so you will still get stuck having to use loan cars until your 100hrs is up.",

Bought Grid AutoSport + Season Pass just because I had money to waste (and maybe to show off to others that I buy expensive games) and I think it is one of the beautiful mistakes I've made in my life.   I was always an avid follower of F1 and thats why I love racing games. Played almost all newer NFS titles where you kind of get a supercar and blast through all the racer and get 1st , 2nd or 3rd place almost every time. Played this game and I got a reality check about what actual racing is. I selected the 'Easy' AI Mode but after 4 races (15th Place , 14th Place , 9th place and 16th place *I ain't joking*) . I had to set the AI to 'Very Easy' mode. Even after that , I've managed to get the podium 2 times ONLY (2nd and 3rd) even after playing almost 30+ races.   If you think you've mastered racing games just because you can play NFS , play this game. I'm sure you'll love it. Although I understand that this game is frustrating at times just because the amount of complexity you'll have to go through e.g. In Online mode car damage will affect your car's performance and trust me when I say that I wanted to threw away my laptop just because I couldn't come 1st in a race just because my car's handling failed after getting hit by another car. I've only played like 2-3 games online so I dont know much about that but I'm really enjoying the Single Player mode.As of now , I've only tried 'Touring' and 'Endurance' disciplines but I plan to try other ones soon enough.   And about the optimization part , I'm running this game maxed out in Intel HD 5200 and haven't encountered a visual glitch till now. Also , the visuals are really top notch. Somethimes when playing , I felt like I was racing in a real world (but I'm too much dreamy so you can ignore that part :'D ) This game also has a good set of cars and racing tracks .....   Well , to finish , I know I spoke too much in my review but if you can , buy this game. You'll have countless hours of fun like I'm having .... Thank You again for reading this length pile of garbage. P.S. I never played Asseto Corsa and don't plan to. So , please don't tell me about how Asseto Corsa is better than Grid : Autosport even if it is !! Thank You :)",

            "review_text": "There's a problem with the Steam ratings system, and that's that you have a binary 'YES' or 'NO' as to if you'd recommend a game. I need a third category for GRID Autosport, a wavy hand, non-committal noise, a sort of shrug.  I'm a big fan of racing games in general and have been buying Codemasters racers since TOCA Race Driver 2. I’ve bought GRID and GRID 2 and enjoyed them both, I actually wrote a positive review of GRID2 on Steam. But GRID Autosport is...*does hand rocking back and forward motion*.  So what's wrong? The biggest fault in this game is the AI. It’s bad, not terrible, just pretty stupid. AI cars really want to hit that racing line. Quite often you'll find them piling up at the first corner as they all try to take the same line through. A savvy player can avoid the melee and gain quite a few places straight away. More annoying is when you're taking a corner and the AI clips your back end sending you spinning out. Of course, this happens in real world racing but it feels all to frequent in GRID Autosport making the AI feel cheap and frustrating. It made me wonder if the flashback game mechanic was implemented because they couldn’t be bothered to fix the AI and decided that the player could just rewind and take evasive action should they get rear ended and end up in a wall! But because the AI behaves so badly you don't really care about smashing them up to get ahead. This can turn races into something of a demolition derby and ruins the immersion somewhat. Far better was the system in Need For Speed: Shift which rewarded you for a more passive (or aggressive) racing style, that way you could at least play a persona. Also the less said about the total waste of an AI race partner the better. There's also nothing new here. If you've played the last two outings you've seen most of what this game has to offer. I might be mistaken but I think all the tracks are recycled and they've ditched the point-to-point racing that was so much fun in GRID2 (though you can get it back as DLC, it’s not part of the main career mode). Drag racing could have been new and fun (reminiscent of the ace drag racing from Need For Speed Underground) but again, that comes as a DLC and isn't part of the main career.   So what's right? Graphically it’s quite the looker. The cars are detailed (and there are quite a few of them), the tracks feel alive and interesting (racing through the construction site that is Dubai is a particular highlight). The car handling seems to have been refined from the previous outing and the multi-disciplined approach means you really have to focus on how you drive as you, for example, switch between the easy to drive, stable at speed Touring Cars and the fast but skittish GT Race Cars. Moreover the number of disciplines keeps things varied and interesting. You'll be bumper to bumper racing in Touring Cars, managing your tyre wear in Endurance, getting sideways in Drift. That you don't need to be the best in a particular discipline to progress is neat too (mid table finishes still earn XP, albeit slower than finishing top).  There's enough in this game to keep me coming back (and I will do until I finish it because I'm compulsive like that) so because Steam only gives me a binary choice I'll give a thumbs up. But this is likely the last GRID game I pick up. The racing marketplace is about to get a whole lot more competitive with the exciting Project CARS on the horizon, and I reckon the GRID series, without an overhaul, will end up languishing in mid-pack.",

With the first game, I thought they were going for the Forza/Gran Turismo market, which... they didn't succeed at. With Grid 2, I have NO IDEA what the hell they were thinking. So that brings us to Grid Autosport, which still doesn't seem to go for that sim feel, although it's much closer than Grid 2 ever was. So if that's not the goal, this doesn't really feel like an arcade racer, either. It just feels like a very pretty, but ultimately not-great racing game. The entire series has an identity crisis, as if it doesn't know whether to be a sim or an arcade game, and that just leaves it teetering in the middle where nobody is going to be satisfied.",

Look up how many people can't join any servers and stupid fixes and let that speak for itself.  Coming from a long time GRID 1 player (600+ hours) this game tried to address everyones outrage to how terriblke Grid 2 was. Welll... they tried but didn't listen to what the customers wanted. People straight up told them to copy Grid 1 physics and have a cockpit view. Guess What?  They screwed both of those simple request up. Cockpit view is a half ♥♥♥ low quality job that is laughable by todays standards. Driving physics are bad.. not bad as grid 2 but they are not enjoyable like Grid 1. I enjoyed driving in grid 1, The cars feel off and are not anything like cars in Grid 1 were.   Grid Autoport lacks the soul of its predesessor, I feel ripped off they even put Grid in the title and tried to play it off like 'ohhh yea we understand Grid 2 was a big pile of steaming dog poo..

            "review_text": "I didn't want to do a review of this so soon, but I had the torrent of this and logged a good 20 or so hours into it before it went on sale on Steam, so I think that is enough to have a good enough idea and experience to do one.  First off the presentation of GAS is very well done. The introduction, the personalization and the way everything flows is very refreshing. The racing scene is pretty deep with various disciplines to choose from, though you will eventually have to do every one of them to get into the GRID series.  The visuals are absolutely spectacular, especially for a game that only came out for PC and last gen consoles. GAS really shows off the best the EGO 3 engine has to offer and what's is capable of, even if it was built and made for 360/PS3.  The AI is much improved over GRID 2 and the 'hard' difficulties are actually a challenge for once. Codemasters said this was wheel to wheel racing and that it is.   Before I dwell deeper into the review, here is a breakdown of the pros and cons IMO;  +Graphics/Visuals +Sound +Presentation +Multiple Disciplines +Teammate   -Forced Drifting -Upgrade System -Teammate (yes both a pro and a con) -Lack of detailed in-car cockpit view  -Forced to play all disciplines -Some disciplines not as well done as others -Lacking car selection -Team Offers   One of the stand out negatives you will be faced with, is the fact you are forced to play all disciplines and some of those disciplines are clearly inferior to others. Open Wheel, Street and Touring are very well done and thought out. However Tuner and Endurance is a joke. Tuner would of been great, if it wasn't the one buzz kill and sole aspect that completely ruins the discipline and that is drifting. Drifting in this game, as most other games that incorporate it are utter trash and more work than it needs to be. Codemasters stated that GAS was 'bringing racing and the series back to its roots'. However, drifting is not grass roots racing, nor is it really racing at all. It is an extreme niche and is more of an art form then racing, and should of either been taken out completely or been an optional DLC add-on like Drag Racing is. I liked Drifting, 10 years ago when it was a fad....  Some other notable negatives to touch on is the team mate mechanic. Though the presentation and potential is there, the execution is not. Not sure what the point of them really are, as more often than not, they suck and almost always bring your team rating down. They give you the option to assign various driving mechanics to them while racing like HOLD, PUSH and ATTACK, but I’ve found that none of the settings really matter and even on PUSH and ATTACK setting they still more often than not, drop back in the pack. I hope they expand more on this in later titles and have more customization for the player to fine tune teammate(s).  The last thing I want to mention are the team offers and upgrades. Team offers are somewhat pointless as the only differences between them are the level of tuning you can do, XP you can earn and simple pre-installed upgrades already applied to the team cars. Why offer any type of 'upgrade' mechanic if the player has no control over them, other than to take them off? Better teams have more upgrades pre-installed, but it's a roll of the dice on which ones you get and it seems to be based on what difficulty you had set the previous championship. i.e. you have better team offers and pre-installed upgrades the higher you set the difficulty, which this alone is counter-productive. I always tend to set my racing games to the hardest they can be, but I am not everyone.   All in all though this is a great game. By no means is this a racing simulator, but I would rank it up with Shift and Shift 2 as not a full on sim, but not a full on arcade racer either. Though at least with Shift 2 you have an upgrade system lol.  Stunning visuals and sound will leave you wanting more. Plenty of real world tracks and rendered cities to race in with a mediocre amount of cars, but good enough selection, though some choice as to what cars we race in would been better.   In the end I give this a 7 /10 ",

The different classes of race and cups, the simple increase of level of each class and the selection of sponsors give this game a good linear direction. Something which was missing in Grid 2, which was all over the place like a crazy woman's makeup.  The upgrades on the cars are a bit restrictive, as it the setup on some sponsor cars, but having no control over that makes for good playability as you need to adjust your driving style for the car. And I like that.  Graphics are nice maxed out, some dodgy 8-bit styling coming from building reflections on the cars.. But that's really just nit-picking. The engine seems to be a lot more polished and infinitely more optomised. A massive step up from G2.  Where the game falls down are, in my opinion, the strength of team mates and the audible names. 3rd generation of Grid should at least have more names than the first. I mean there are completely bizarre names on there, but Doug is still left out! *huffs*  All in all a great little game from Codemasters, but I just can't understand why they made this a full product and not just an epic DLC for Grid 2.",

Anyway, from the very beginning we see an awesomely made trailer, the graphics appeared to be so good that I haven't figured out at first whether it was real footage or animation.

The crashing cars, the dust, the rain, everything looks just so good. I didn't really care for the soundtrack, the ambient music was so-so, but I usually would play something else, apart from the game, the car sounds and stuff...I guess they're realistic? I've never been to any race in real life to say for sure but it sounded quite decent at least for me. The lady voice that goes with you through all the menu might irritate you after several tens of hours, but you anyway will be able to talk to your...team dude who tells you stuff about whether your car broke or not, your rival position and so on, I don't honestly know how he is called.

The driving in this game definately appeals more to hardcore 'Sim' racer ( by bringing back cockpit view among other things ) and this game definately rewards you for that by giving you XP bonuses for driving a clean race without collisions.  Right off the bat, the game looks graphically similar to GRID 2 but there are noticeable improvements in car textures ( Free DLC to update car livery textures to 4k res ), lighting and shadows.   Multiplayer is quite fun with you having to work your way up from the bottom.

If i made it a point to negotiate turns as i would in real life, it worked out better.   CONS:   - HOWEVER (on the last point) the ST is known for it's ludicrous cornering ability, and i had to upgrade the car and Soften the front suspenstion/stiffen the rear suspension to get the most realistic driving experience one should expect from the ST. I could be biased but the car is an autocross machine and handles perfectly well just as stock.  - car interiors ARE A JOKE. I only play racing games in first person in-car view so as to fully immerse myself in the experience. i hate to compare this to Need for Speed, but if you look at Shift, the interiors, even for the low-end/old drifter cars, are immaculately rendered, and you can look around. in Grid, looking left or right blinks the screen left or right to an un-interior generic side view, giving me no frame of reference because my driver didn't turn his head. In addition, on graphical settings where the cockpit isn't blurred, the instrumentation is blocky and disgusting. at night, no dashboard or other interior lights are visible. Again, i drive a focus, and although the shape of the top of the dashboard is correct (even reflecting *almost* as i would expect when the sun hits it, i'm sorry but at night that console needs to be LIT. So yeah, Codemasters, MASSIVE missed opportunity with the car interior. i can't bring myself to look left or right because what i get is a generic blank view of what's on the left or right because my driver doesn't turn his head like NFS Shift so i have no frame of reference, and the worst part is it's just as well because what IS rendered of the interior of the car is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ POS anyway in both texture and polygon terms. Bad bad bad car interior.   That's it, every other part of the game is straight up FUN, with beautifully rendered and presented cars on beautiful tracks and HOLY ♥♥♥♥ I'M DRIVING IN PARIS THIS IS SO COOL and the driving is awesomely gratifying in just the right realistic correct way that one can get better at before they know it.

Grid, i'm looking at something a 6 year old made using Duplo bricks.

I'd played some pretty arcady racers on various sources including PC but honestly wanted that legit racing feel without the tediousness of some of the more intense sim racers.  One thing to point out, if you're used to arcade racing games, get ready to spin out over and over. However, you should have faith. I'm playing on a 360 controller for Windows on 8.1 and setting the difficulty to the base 'Easy' setting is giant help. It gives you the full racing line by default which shows you not only the best line on the track but also, via color changing as indication, shows you relatively how fast you need to be going for certain portions of the track. This really comes in handy when getting used to the braking in turns. This game is not a game you can simply swing your back end around the corners in. Once you begin to get the hang of it though, the whole thing becomes satisfying and rewarding. I like the way the different racing specialties are set up in the career mode. It allows you to choose from all but the GRID Autosport Series which is apparently reserved for when you've mastered all the others.   As of right now, I've played through a season in both the Touring and Street series'. The Street series seems like a great place to start because the speeds don't get too much above 100mph and the cars handle well. I have yet to play any multiplayer so I will refrain from commenting on it until I get the chance to join in.  VERDICT: Great game so far.",

This game is almost completely different in its feel, with drifting just being a side option, and not a centerpiece (thank God). A lot of tryhards here don't like this game because its not a hyper realistic driving sim or some crap like that. Honestly, it doesn't matter. If you want a fun game to play on your couch (splitscreen is awesome with a friend) thats intense, but still easy to learn, then this is the game for you. My only gripe would be that i'd like more cars. Seeing only 2-4 choices per event is a bit dissapointing, having played forza in which there are dozens of options. I'm not sure i should have to pay extra for the DLC just to get cars that should have been in the game in the first place.

The replays are less interesting, the smoke and damage effects are poor and the sound is really dull. The inside of a touring car sounds like its full of cotton wool.  Its not terrible but is not as good as the original GRID, and it should be leaps and bounds ahead nowadays.  The career is also very limiting and is simply a succession of single races.  I do like the addition of practice, qualifying and reverse ordering of cars in round 2. Also, the time penalties and ability to multiply the number of laps.

Critical: 5 BSOD events during playing the game itself. Playing the older Grid 2 yields hours of interrupted gameplay, or anything else for that matter. Then lose all your progress from starting the game before the crash.   Cons:  1. AI: Can concur with most that the AI is behaving in an unruly manner, especially ones by Ravensport. What's more as easily they can spin you out, you can't retaliate effectively by PIT because they seem to be immune from pushing?  2. Downforce + Grip: I can expect the Touring cars to be slidy, but a F312 Dallara acts like its driving on ice. Or things one would expect to have more default downforce. Also AI seems to be able to slide at speed, while player cannot.  3. Tuning: Inital mid level tuning is too coarse for some courses. It should be full tuning at all times or never at all. Tuning is also a cure for the poor grip/downforce on the F312 for example.  4. The nag everytime a season ends. If I wanted it to be harder, I would be playing Asseto Corsa with a phone keypad. Or drive a real car. Just saying. 5. Endurance: At the shortest length, the tyre wear is overly much. If it happened in real life, you would sue the tyre company. Also losing grip means driftiness, but the controls won't allow finessed drifting, thus crashes occur.   Pros: 1. First time I had an opportunity to drive Aussie V8 supercars. I now understand why the country is divided into before races.  2. Discipline variety: Keep alternating to relive the tedium of driving on the same tracks in every possible direction. Like the old days of NFS underground. Surprisingly apart from the speed, one can drive the same way between all categories.   Since I would not be able to finish the game without crashes every other race, this game is a reminder of my own folly of buying a pre-order sim from CM ever.",

The same mix of sim and arcade elements combined with an aggressive AI, but with today's graphics.  Although I'd have preferred a full dashboard, the out of focus one you get is IMHO still passable and effective.  Handling is fun, (luckily) with a little less emphasis on drifting than GRID 2, and together with an aggressive AI you get the style of close simcade racing that the original GRID was known for. Note if you are looking for a full racing sim, you are better off buying something like AC, rFactor2, GSC or R3E, but if like the occasional lighter sim GRID Autosport is pretty much a home run.  Now it may be irrational and I have to do more comparing, but there are areas (besides the dashboard, team management and elements of the GUI) where I still think the original is better, however the same is true for GRID Autosport (handling is a mixed bag, FFB setup, graphics).  So basically I like GRID Autosport, solid simcade, fun and aggressive racing 7.5 - 8/10  I am racing on hard, no aids with a DFGT. System i7-920, 16gb, w7-64b and 780GTX - runs a solid 60fps  Ok, couple observations..  Like - close hard racing when you suddenly see a car in front fly in the air and rolling passed you. Miss - the old GRID damage cam is still better. Overall replay is clunkier, just slight improvement over GRID 2 AI - on hard the AI can basically keep up even after a rwd car hast lost one of its rear tires and is driving on the rim.  Small things that can make or break your gaming experience,  CM made a benchmark game with the original GRID and they are having difficulties mixing 'innovation' with proven game elements. Perhaps it is my age, but I am starting to hate the excessive push to innovate games to the detriment of success formulas. Reviewers and even players give games a poor rating because they are not innovative enough. Me, if it works, copy it and just update the graphics and physics to match the next generation of technology - I'll buy it.  Don't push yourself to reinvent the wheel, give us what works what we really like to play.  GRID Autosports is just that. CM took a good look at the original GRID and tweaked their GRID 2 base game until it neared the original GRID.  Next time I hope CM will remember and produce a GRID 3 that is basically GRID with updated physics and graphics.  Better yet get a couple of licenses, something like V8SC would really be a perfect match for this engine.  A full championships beats the many 'analog' single events with just a couple of cars and tracks each. Get the right license and you'll have the next F1 'easy win'.  Did I mention V8 Supercars - dunno how they do it, but that's probably the most exciting TC racing on the planet, with a good mix of high tech, close competitive racing, challenging tracks and oozing with sheer character.  You even already have the some of the cars in GRID Autosports.  Did I mention V8 Supercars? ...and the Utes :)",

The custom-lobbys typically required lots/all of the DLCs, which basically is about making you pay 2-5€ for content you already had in Grid 2.  The default setting in the voice-chat is 'voice activation', so lots of players don't know they 'spam' the voice chat. So another unusable feature. But the main online-problem is the money: You have very high amounts you have to pay to maintain your car. The most-fun-groups of cars, like Endurance G2 (FIA GT3) are so expensive that even a win won't let you afford the required per-race maintenance. And in order to get as much money as possible, you need to add bots to your lobby sometimes, which ruins the game again. The greatest thing are the challenges. It is about posting 1-lap/3-lap times and comparing them, with your friends and the whole world. The bad thing in the challenges is: bots ruin this feature too. Especially the race events are bad: Medium-Difficulty Bots are unremoveable in the races and destroy anything of race-excperience or fun. Only after you passed them, it is fun.

This game, for me, hits a nice sweet spot between arcade racer and sim-light that really brings the joy of driving through. I don't need to dedicate my life to it to enjoy it, but it's also not so simple that it would become stale quickly. With five playable driving disciplines, a rewarding progression system, and online play--this is a game I would definitely recommend for the racing fan open to an experience that's more a celebration of speed and competition than a technically accurate simulation.",

            "review_text": "This game was Codemasters' last chance to make things right. They blew it completely. Here is why:   1. Cockpit views - a bloody shame when compared to the lovely one that the original GRID came with.  2. Handling - worse than GRID 2 and incredibly bad compared to the original GRID; trying to manage oversteer with keyboard is a chore to put it lightly.  3. Car tuning - a total joke, even NFS Underground 2 was better; you might think that Codemasters could at least copy things right, but that would be smart 4. Career - the whole team experience package from the original GRID is missing; no comment 5. Endurance races - Codemasters managed to screw them up really hard; Le Mans is gone, as well as the day-night cycles during the race - instead you have to fight tire wear and AI that seems not really affected by that 6. Blur - once you deactivate that, your eyes suddenly feel like they don't need glasses (yes, it's that bad), but you will instantly see how shoddy the textures were made; the rest of the game is similarly crafted  ...  Given this trainwreck, Codemasters claim that they listened to the community was a blatant lie. Unless acting upon the feedback was optional (in their opinion). You get the picture, I hope. In my not so humble opinion, this game and its developer by extension have managed to insult the first (legendary) GRID again, which to this day remains the undisputed champion. Those many awards back then were well deserved, but Codemasters as it is today does not deserve your money for this game right now. Do yourself and your wallet a favor, enjoy the first GRID (the game that does it right) and ignore the 'pretenders' that followed afterwards. Cheers.",

            "review_text": "The good: The feel of the racing is great, not too arcadey or too simulation, just right for a casual racer like me. And the fact that AI now make mistakes is a very good feature. For ages I've wanted a game where the player isn't the only driver doing any overtaking or causing drama, because in real life every driver can make mistakes and Grid has finally managed to show that. The drivers actually pressure you in this game, where as in some games you feel like the AI dont challenge you enough. Lets be honest, there is not a lot of good touring car games out there, and this is probably the best of the touring car games.  The bad: It's WAY to predictable. In Grid 1, the ravenwest team was exactly the same, dominating every race and winning everything, and when Grid Autosport was announced, codemasters was happy to announce that ravenwest was back. The only thing i was thinking when they announced the return of ravenwest is 'Not good'. What makes racing exciting (for instance the BTCC) is competition. Anyone in the BTCC, ranging from matt neal, jason plato, andrew jordan, giovanardi, colin turking, and a lot more have the chance of winning races and being a potential champion. Grid Autosport however... has completely got that all wrong. I am soley a touring car driver, so i dont know About the other events, but in the touring discipline, you can pretty much gaurentee Nathan Mckane and his ravenwest teammate will come in 1st and 2nd, with the team kicker guys coming in 3rd and 4th. EVERY SINGLE RACE, you can pretty much predict where everyone is going to finish. The occasional switiching of positions, but thats rare to say the least. You feel like theres no point there being any other team, since ravenwest will ALWAYS... and i mean ALWAYS win the races. This bad feature alone has made me dislike this game A LOT. If the game was less predictable and ravenwest wasn't the only team capable of winning a race, this game would be much MUCH MUCH better. I also don't like the career mode. I never have in Code master games. They have improved it since Grid 1 since now i can specialise in touring cars, but theres no true progression in the game. Each season the teams are exactly the same. In games such as FIFA, each season is different as players transfer to different teams, new younger players are introduced, and old players retire. Each season is different. But with Grid Autosport (and likewise for games such as F1), the teams are always the same every season, and if you change to a different team, the other driver that was in that team just randomly disappears.. you'd think if i took one of the ravenwest guys positions, because they are 'So great' they'd change to a different team, but no...  Sidenote: I also think they should of added team creation again. I wanted to be competing in the touring cars championship with my own team, and my own selected team mate, like in Grid 1.  Despite not recommending this game yet, if they fix what I think is wrong with this game, I would recommend this game to ALL. I like that code masters have gone back to touring cars and by no means hate the disciplines in the game, just the predictablity.",

Not only are there a variation in the kind of competitions youll be in and the cars youll drive, but also the tracks all handle differently and you need to learn to adapt. It is quite a skill to not only go fast, but also to handle your corners correctly.  Im so glad that Autoport still has the raceline option as well as the flashback.

I had enjoyed GRID 2 with my friends for countless hours, and a unification of both games sounded to me like what would be the greatest racing experience for the PC. Codemasters truly did do a great job combining the two games and Autosport boasts fantastic graphics and gameplay mechanics. However, to the dismay of it's fanbase, they had actually subtracted one of the better features of the game with the addition of the disciplinary and vehicle class systems for races. One of the best parts about GRID 2 was the ability to use any car of the event's tier you had desired. There's amazing hilarity and joy in racing an X-bow against a GT-R, and going head to head with racers of all disciplines and varieties, but in GRID Autosport, players are restricted to use class specific vehicles in races, for example, from 20 available cars for a drift event in GRID 2 down to a measely 3 in Autosport. There is no challenge against other players. I love the GRID franchise, but Autosport's discipline system really kills the enjoyment of racing with friends. I sincerely hope and pray that Codemasters considers returning the Tier system or implementing a type of Free Class for multiplayer matches in a upcoming patch or downloadable content to return GRID Online to it's most enjoyable state.",

These few options to customize your car don't make a racing sim.  I will probably play this game to the end - it's not bad, it's has good graphics, physics of your (only) car are good, unless you play using keyboard, which will result mostly in frustration. I would kill anyone who thought the in-race commentary would be a Good Thing the way it is in GRID Autosport though. However I like the option to request information about your teammate, car status and my own position in the race thru this commentary system (there's four keys that let you do that). Music is, well, forgettable. In-race music is never good in a (would-be) racing sim, so it's good that there's none.  DLC - whoever sells tracks that were in GRID 2 at additional price as a DLC has it all wrong. It's because of this - game has very steep price and there's DLCs that cost equally unreasonable price. I wouldn't buy these even on christmas sale.  Anyway buy this game only if you really have no other way to spend your money. If you do, consider GRID 2 first.",

            "review_text": "After almost 40 hours and over 300 races in the solo campaign on this game on hard difficulty with my gamepad, I have to say: this game is probably one of the best in the genre that I have played of recent on the PC. I thoroughly enjoyed both Grid 1 and 2, but I put 20+ hours more time into Autosport than I did the first 2, and for good reason too.  This game has great diversity in both cars and tracks. On top of this, it also has 5 disciplines: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner and Street. So whether you're into drifting around a track to score the most amount of points, or endure a 12 minute race without burning your tired out, or just want a straight up race, this game offers a lot for fans of the racing genre. Plus, there is a free DLC available for the game that allows you to play a demolition derby mode, much like the previous game in the series.  As you race in these various disciplines, you will earn XP and will gain levels based on a) how many races you participate in, and b) how well you do in those races. Once you have reached level 3 in ALL disciplines, you will unlock the first Grid Series Championship event (level 6 = the next and level 9 the last). This will take upwards of 30 hours to achieve, which is why I put so much time into this game. And I enjoyed the ride (no pun intended) :)  So, if you enjoyed the previous games or have played other racing games such a the DiRT series or even popular racers on console (e.g. Forza), then I'm sure you will like this game, and hence I definitely recommend it! The car physics are a bit of a cross between arcade and simulation too, so if you weren't a fan of Grid 2 and adored the first in the series, you should try this one out. Plus, in the solo campaign, there's no purchasing of new cars nonsense. You simply pick a team and get given cars to drive in (which, personally, I preferred!).  Enjoy! :D",

            "review_text": "The original GRID seemed to nail the balance between a simulation and an arcade experience. GRID: Autosport has a more sim-like feel, which may appeal to some but not to me. The cars feel big and like you have to lug them through turns, yet oddly there's a tipping point while braking where suddenly the car will basically do a 180 if you so much as tap the stick. The braking feels all over the place, probably because the game doesn't convey an intuitive sense of speed: 75 mph feels the same as 150 mph. Regardless, this is a game where proper braking is absolutely crucial, but the game does you no favors. The distance markers are too small, for example, and the announcer is useless. It all adds up to an unintuitive sense of control, and in racing games, if the control isn't there it's a good bet the overall gaming experience is in serious trouble.  I've only played a couple drift events but so far it's a hot mess. This game seems to think spinning your tires = drifting. The sweet spot of control through a turn is almost non-existent. You never get that 'let it all hang out' feeling through a turn because going open throttle on even a straight will send you out of control! What were they thinking? But worse, there is no sense of what makes a good drift or a bad drift. There's some vague connection to markers on the sides of the turns but I've done absolutely sh**ty drifts of just tire-spinning and fish-tailing and they seem to score as well if not better than a controlled slide (on the extremely rare occasion the game lets me perform one).  Menus and skill progression, similar to Dirt 3, are terrible and totally uninspiring. I don't know why it's so hard for them. In the case of G:AS it's an extremely minimalist design that could easily have come from an 80s or 90s game, and gives you very little sense of progress, or why progress even matters. The tiers in the original GRID were not a standout but they did the job. Every game Codemasters has produced in the last few years has this sort of wannabe minimalist avant-garde look that also happens to be just passable at conveying information. It's better than Dirt 3's triangles, is about the best I can say.  And Codemasters, it's just a videogame. You don't need to confirm every freakin' decision I make. Do I really want to exit Practice Mode? YES, FREAKING YES!! If I accidentally pick the wrong thing and lose my race, it's not like I just deleted my dissertation or formatted my hard drive. So enough with the stupid confirming. Please Please fire the menu team. They have no idea how to design menus that compliment the rest of the game and they're annoying as hell.  Bottom line: all this adds up to a game that is just not terribly fun to play. It's not a horrible game but in both real cars and car racing games, the crucial make or break element is that intangible feeling of driving excitement. Racing is supposed to be edge of your seat type stuff, and this doesn't feel like it at all. It just feels mediocre. Glad I got this on sale but unless future Codemaster game reviews are overwhelmingly positive, this is likely my last purchase.",

But this game... what the hell is wrong with it?!   * The slipstreaming doesn't work. At all.  * All the AI cars accelerate much faster than you, and seem to have a higher top speed. So corners are the only way to overtake anyone. You'd think from a standing start - you'd have equal chance as everyone, but all you see is every AI car rushing ahead of you, while your finger clenches the trigger as hard as it can for accelerate.  * AI is rubbish. Why do they even give you challenges like 'no collision race' if the AI just rams you every chance it gets?  * Difficulty is broken. The AI acts absolutely the same, whether you set it to hard or very easy. The assists are the only thing that affects the driving.  I've tried to like this game, because PC doesn't really get that many great driving games that lean towards simulation. When reading about its features - I thought this would be the closest a PC game has come to Gran Turismo (albeit without car collecting / customizing) but it wasn't. It's just not fun when it's unplayable.   If you are looking for a good arcadey/simulationy game on Steam - check out GRID 2, DiRT 3. Would NOT recommend GRID Autosport.",

The fundamental problem I encounter is that in the back of my mind I keep thinking about Forza III for X360, which was kind of the high-water mark of racing games as far as I'm concerned. Grid is not without it's charm. The graphics are gorgeous. The course designers have been faithful to the areas you can race in. The races, even against the easiest of easy AI are tough. This has turned out to be both incredibly infuriating and rewarding.  There are a few things I find grating. The multiplayer is nearly impossible to connect to. The races available aren't well matched and you have to change your download server within Steam to the United Kingdom in order to find anyone to race against. The whole, car per contract per season setup is kind of irritating as well. I realize they probably wanted maintain some aspect of hardcore racing sim, but part of the appeal of Forza III was the ability to pretty much put any car on the track you choose. All in all, if you have no current console, I would recommend the game if you are jonesing for a race, but not if you want to compete against real people on the internet.",

            "review_text": "First of all let me say that I bought this game and all the DLC in a sale, so my perspective may be different than others.  Everyone wants something different in a racing game. Some want a sim, some want the ability to throw throw turtle shells, some want to drive six-figure cars without the real-world limitiations such cars have. When a game doesn't meet the needs of a particular player, it is easy to say the game is 'bad' when it may not be the case. I like a healthy dose of aggression in my racing games whether it be from projectiles, or some good old-fashioned rammin'.  GRID Autosport falls into a good place on the continum. The physics are realistic enough that there is a challenge, but not so much that I can't drive faster than 60mph without spinning out. The damge modeling is strict enough to encourage clean passing, but forgiving enough that I can use my time-tested 'Get on the inside of the other drivers and use them as a bumper' conering technique. The AI is agressive, but not Sebastian Vettel.   These factors come together to make the racing feel like an impression of a real race--trading paint, driving at the limit to catch up to the car ahead while fending off the cars behind, stubbornly accelerating while the other drivers start braking before a turn, risking a catastrophic crash to squeeze into an impossibly small space, etc. The flashback feature emboldens you to, as your coach says 'Take some risks' without fear of runing your race.   As you probably know, there are several disciplines and event types but to me the game really shines in the 'Street' and 'Touring' modes (in that order). Even though there are a lot of recycled tracks and you have to play through the series' multiple times to unlock all the cars I've never had a boring race and that's what keeps me coming back. Not many other games have you catching air on the urban-hills of San Fransisco in a Mclaran P1, ramming a Koniseegg Agera sending it flipping down the other side, then making sure you hit the braking zone so you make it through the chiccane smothly.",

The last time I played a racing game was probably back when Need for Speed Underground was released! So yeah, I'm kind of new when it comes to modern racing simulators.  As for Grid: Autosport, the graphics are great and the gameplay is tough. The cars do look fantastic, as does the scenery but it's when you get in the drivers seat that you really notice how great the game looks. I haven't experienced any glitches or problems during races and I'm using a wired Xbox controller to play as, for me, a controller is easier than a keyboard in a racing simulator. The different types of races, including Endurance, Street and Drift keep the game from feeling repetitive and I don't think it's something that can be completed quickly. If you want to do the whole hog and come first in all the races, it's going to take some time.  Hope this helps!",

So many drivers just ram others to spin them out and to get infront. The game is very unfair and not a true measure of the drivers actual competencey as a good or bad racer. They came soooo close to making it amazing but left a huge mistake out. They penalise you to harshly for cutting corners and not enough if u ram others??? wtf seriously.   If you can handle never getting the position you deserve and dont mind the occasional rage eg often. Then its not to bad ly made game 7 out of 10 , really really could have been a 10 wtf! were u thinking grid!",

Theres basically no buying of cars except online or customizing basically any way, and the online aspect,pffffft ya i keep trying to find races against other people and i have yet to find one in the few hours ive played. I bought all the dlc too since it was on sale, that was also a waste, the drag racing, wow no burnout box it basically does it for you then you junp off the line and have waaaaay too much tire spin as if you have stock tires and didnt warm them up in the burnout box. All in all im severely disappointed in this and othe games codemasters comes out with, i appreciate that they are basically one of few that try to give us pc gamers some racing but they just cant do it like gran turismo and forza do and that a shame.And yes i know i only have a few hours on this game so take it for what it is but if you look at most the revies, you dont need that much time to realize what this game is and isnt, so hopefully this helps.",

I am playing it more than DiRT Rally, Project CARS, or Assetto Corsa. The support for my Fanatec Porsche 911 GT2 wheel and Fanatec Clubsport Pedals v1 seems great.
