            "review_text": "Pac-Man 256 is inspired by the Level 256 Glitch that appears in the original Pac-Man game. When one reaches level 256, the right half of the maze bugs out as a result of the game trying to spawn 256 'fruit' in the bottom right corner. Regardless of the level being impossible to complete, the maze is traversable.  In Pac-Man 256, not only will you be doing the same thing on Pac-Man, but you must escape from the Glitch at the bottom of the screen that's trying to kill you as well, all the while trying to get a good score. Each of the ghosts has its own pattern, so you'll need to memorize which ghost does what in any given situation. There are also additional features, such as a Pac-Dot chain, Ghost Chains greater than 4 ghosts, powerups that help kill off ghosts, and a leaderboard that records your top scores.  Pac-Man 256 can be brutal at times, but the replay value is worth the price. And this is unlike the mobile version of the game: Credits are removed, no advertisements, and no upgrade wait times are big perks when compared to the mobile version. If you're still unsure, give it a try on mobile if you can.",

            "review_text": "Out of nowhere this just came along and turned what was originally a pretty mediocre, IAP ridden mobile game with crappy touch controls (WTF plays ANY kind of Pac-Man with swipe controls to begin with?) into one of the most fun games I have played this year thus far. Get this, then get your friends and family to get it and have a fantastic time competing with each other on the leaderboards. Removing the IAP garbage and adding full controller support has catapulted it to the heavens. And just when things could not get any more fun or entertaining for $4.99, they went and added co-op couch multiplayer for up to four people at once! The great thing about this multiplayer too is that instead of competing against each other you are helping other as a team to accumulate your high score. It is perfect to play with your kids.  As a Pac-Man fan since the very beginning of his existence, I cannot recommend this enough. I will even go as far as saying that I am enjoying it more as a pick up and go game than DX just for its more laid back approach.  5 Blinky's out 5!",

Obviously, if you are looking for an FPS shooter or a deep story drive RPG, then you need to look elsewhere, lol.. just sayin'  I streamed the game when it first launched on Steam after purchasing it myself...

The game is really really fun if you have another player too, though it is limited to local co-op as far as I am aware. There isn't really much else to say about this game; it's PAC-MAN, and if you have never played PAC-MAN, then this would probably be a good start for a newcomer.",

Pac Man 256 is very addictive and keeps you coming back for just another go. While it can never match the original or Pac Man CE DX+ (one of the best games of all time) it's still a fantastic addition to the franchise and for only 3.99? Bargain!!! Grab it!",

It is however a great take on an old classic and the fact that you have to keep moving forward without turning back makes you calculate teh timing of collecting powerups and the exact paths that you need to take in order to progress. All in all for this price, I would definitely recommend it.",

            "review_text": "I played this for about two hours. Its addictive, its fun, but its free on phones, and vastly inferior to Pac Man Championship Edition DX.   PAC-MAN 256 is a Pacman interpretation of Crossy Roads. Pacman must navigate an RNG maze with ghosts with new behaviors exclusive to 256 (Pinky is still the biggest threat though.) Behind Pacman is a wall of 8-bit glitchy cacophony that swallows everything up. You rack up points primarily from dot combos, which max out at 256, hence the name. Furthermore, an assortment of powerups is gradually collected for your arsenal, which replace traditional power pellets and which you can optionally equip.  The pace is frantic and fun like Crossy Roads, but I hope you don't care about score, because 256 is basically at the mercy of RNG. Occasionally very tight dual lanes will generate with no escape. Your dot combos are occasionally broken by areas where the dots simply stop for no reason. The worst offender of them all is the camera. THE CAMERA! IN A PAC MAN GAME! The camera is centered around PAC man no matter what, limiting your view of whats ahead, and what awaits you when you use the side warps to stay alive.  Children will like this, I know I do, but they could get it free on their phone, and for a more finely tuned experience, CE DX is the superior alternative.",
