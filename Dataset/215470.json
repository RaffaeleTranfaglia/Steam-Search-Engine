It is extremely fun to play with your friends and the different game modes and maps makes it a game you keep coming back to. The characters feel very unique and are all fun to play, teamwork is greatly rewarded and it's easy to get into.   If you're looking for a dinosaur game then THIS IS IT. If you're just looking for an entertaining multiplayer experience, this won't let you down either.   Become the enourmous T-rex. Gaze upon your prey and stomp your way through the world as you unleash your mighty roar. Rip him to pieces between your jaws.",

It is a lot like Team Fortress 2 but without the annoying community, hackers and general mediocre game experience. Also it has dinosaurs, so there's that.  The sequel coming out on December 3rd (Primal Carnage: Extinction) is going to fix the bugs and add tonnes of new content. The only reason not to buy Primal Carnage is that the sequel is coming out very soon.  I give this game a solid 10/10 for how much I have enjoyed it. Thank you Lukewarm Media for making this game. I just hope that Circle 5 Studios and Pub Games can live up to their predecessor.",

Multiplayer is divided into classes, 5 human, 5 dinosaurs, and the gameplay is fast, furious and will keep you on your toes regardless of your specie/class.   The maps are cleverly designed, with some being more human friendly, and some more dino friendly. This game will give you the dose of adrenaline you are looking for, and it also manages to be a very tense gameplay experience, as a human you always feel you are being hunted, and as a dinosaur you feel like you are stalking your prey.   If you have watched the Jurassic park series of films more times than you can count, and you always wondered how it would be like to be a T-Rex, now is your chance. Primal Carnage delivers on both ends, it's fun to play as a dino and as a human.   The Good  -Five classes for each species, each influencing how you play the game -Get to the choppah mode adds one more dinosaur class (spinosaurus) -Servers are usually full, and perform well (low lag usually)  The Bad  -Non existing story (some people might be thrown off because of that)  -No single player mode   7.5/10",

The game is immersive, the background music as humans makes some of the maps extremely suspenseful. And there's nothing you'll love more than the thrill of hiding from an angry t-rex or spino and having your entire screen shake as they get closer. I've played a few other dinosaur games, but none have come close to the experience of Primal Carnage. I recommend this game to anyone who can press buttons and click a mouse. (everyone, for the most part) The feeling of being a Spinosaurus or T-rex makes you feel untouchable. Yeah, pathfinders are overpowered, but whatever. It feels so good to be a 10 ton behemoth who instakills everything it touches.",

Dinosaurs haven't held up too well in the gaming industry since the last Turok game, and there have been many games trying to bring it back to life, so far the closest one in my opinion is Primal Carnage. The game itself has excellent graphics, renderring beautiful enviroments, and whilst the gameplay itself is limited and quite buggy in times, it is great fun to charge at humans as a giant T-rex, gulping up helpless platyers who run in your path. Even playing the humans can be quite fun. My biggest complaints about this game so far seem to be the map sizes, which can perform imbalances towards the humans as players form large groups which take a lot of cannon fodder to break apart, as most dinosaur players are simply too scattered around the place to intervene.   Not to mention when you're playing a game where a group of humans are fighting against swarms of dinosaurs, there's a hell of a lot of over-the-top stuff to laugh about.  The average price in this game isn't too bad, though I'd wait for a steam sale before buying it, especially since I consider the skin DLC's to offer some pretty cool dino-skins. On sales I'd reccomend this game for any dino-lover who's looking for a good time from the more competitive games out there.",

Primal Carnage is a team-based PvP game with, you guessed it, Dinos and Humans. The only plot is that there's an island where Dinosaurs have been reborn (Jurassic Park gone wrong?) and humans get trapped on the island. The classes are pretty basic, each one has a main and secondary attack, along with Dinos getting a roar ability which buffs other Dinos. The concept of gigantic Tyranosaurs and Spinosaurs isn't as overpowered as you might think, and they pulled it off pretty well, although obviously if you got someone good playing he'll probably wreck your team.  There isn't a big community left, mind you, but it isn't hard finding a full server if you want to play a couple rounds of Dino smashing or Human stompin'. It's worth the $8, but if you can pick it up on a sale go for it. It's freakin' Primal Carnage.",

The core issue in the game itself is its balencing. The balencing is unequal between the dinos and humans, and goes against what you would expect. Classes that should do high damage dont, classes that should have low defense have strong, and similar issues along those lines. There are a lot of tricks to get around these problems that you will quickly learn by playing the game on various maps and learning techniques you can use to help overcome the bad balencing. Otherwise, technically the game runs very well, there are a few of the usual Unreal Engine errors, but certainly nothing game breaking or enjoyment stopping. The game feels VERY smooth to control, and I don't get any motion sickness like I usually do with FPS games, although it is worth noting that setting up a controller is incredibly difficult and not doable from just in game.  So yes while it does have a few issues I find the game itself incredibly enjoyable. The satisfaction of taking out a Rex, or dealing with a bouncy raptor is great, the same as you get as a dino when you manage to sneak up on a human and kill them or set up a run to do mass damage to a group at once. Turning around and seeing a dino charging at you is terrifying, helped by the great sense of scale that the devs have used model wise, and being killed across the map by a human with great aim really keeps you on your toes as a dino. While its not the most spectaular looking game, the graphics and assets they have used work very well together. Flora moves when you touch it, which means keeping your eyes open is very helpful, and the maps are well spaced, and often have unique balencing across various areas of the map itself. There is also a nice variety of map styles that you can play, if you can find servers using them. I do highly recommend the game, and it is great deal of fun, although if the balencing is likely to extremely frustrate you, you might be better off waiting for the v2.0 thats being worked on.",

The thing is, this is not a (really) bad game. The unbalanced cluster f**k matches are really fun. But the game is flawed and there is simply no longer support for it. I have found games that are better than this for free. Tremulous is a great game, for example. It is similar to Primal Carnage, except it's aliens vs humans.  I am starting to loose my train of thought for this review, So I will simply give a quick rundown about this game. Although flawed, it can be very enjoyable. The fact that this game is no longer supported, does hurt it's playability. You won't have a hard time finding players online, but the numbers are starting to decrease.

Sound design: There's not much music in here, but the game sounds extremely good, from amazing shotgun sounds to scientifically accurate dinosaur roars.  Maps: Maps are absolutely amazing, period.  Gameplay: You either play as a human in first person, or a dinosaur in third person. Gameplay needs some tweaking. The character with the shotgun is extremely OP along with the pyro, but you'll enjoy the game nonetheless.  Cons: I initally found this game annoying, but you just have to get into the game before realizing how fun it is. The learning curve is also extremely steep.

I know it looks tempting to buy this game when it's on sale (it's on sale like every other day), and even more so if you are a dinosaur lover like me. But, please, do NOT buy this game, because the multiplayer has literally NEVER worked for me; I did everything: verify the integrity of the game cache, restart steam, delete local content, redownload it, etc. Either something is wrong with my computer, or (I am certain that this is the answer) no one is playing online. Furthermore, I checked the multiplayer servers every day for about a month and voila! Nothing. On the other hand, I did have a bit of fun playing by myself trying out the different characters on the different maps, which all had somewhat interesting characteristics, especially the hilariously bad voiceacting for the humans, but the game, as expected, got boring after that with no other real people to play with. If you want a game that will satisfy your hunger for a dinosaur-related FPS, I'd suggest Dino D-Day. Not sure how good Primal Carnage: Extinction is either but I didn't buy it because of the lack of trust I feel for the developers. Oh and I hope this game wins my custom Steam award 'The Multiplayer Never Worked' lmao. So yeah just get Dino D-Day.",

Circle 5 and Pub Games originally planned to deliver Primal Carnage: Extinction as a free gift to everyone who purchased the original Primal Carnage as a way to satisfy Lukewarm’s statements that this would be a free update. Ultimately Extinction increased dramatically in scope and at this point the project is far over budget. We can’t survive and pay our staff without charging something for Extinction. Customers who purchased the original Primal Carnage before November 20th, 2014, will receive a coupon for 85% off of Extinction’s $20 launch price which will bring the cost of Extinction to $3 for customers who bought the original Primal Carnage. While we do apologize that we couldn’t release this game for free, we’ve made a decision that better supports our ability to deliver ongoing content to the game and in turn delivers more to our community in the long term. A lot of people have devoted a lot of time to building this game, and we fully stand by its value.  So yeah... Take that how you will. They need the money to support themselves, and people who already bought the game get a MAJOR price reduction. Quit whining you selfish gits.",

Armed with thier hilariously effective weapons the team traveled via cargo ship to the dino infested island with no plan, no objectives and no chance of ever winning against the heavily militaried dino force... Luckily for them the developers never released the 'dinosaurs have miniguns and grenade launchers' DLC.",

            "review_text": "Primal Carnage is a great romp of fun!! If you love dinos and can't help but get a thrill out of taking a bite out of the humans, then you'll certainly have a blast with this game! The designs and overall gameplay on dino side is quite a bit fun and each class meshes well with each other.  On human side same thing. The classes are all quite diverse and fun to play as each suits a certain role nicely! It can take some getting used to at first, but once you have a hang on things then you'll be hunting with the best of them!  The only few negative things I have to say about Primal Carnage is that the controls can sometimes be a tad bit wonky. Easy to customize to suit your playstyle of course, but every now and again you might be hung up on the environment or when trying to heal or snag a weapons cache and.....one missed moment could screw up your chances of survival quite a bit. The match time length is also a HUGE pain sitting at about 40mins per round. :( If that was alterable that'd be a big boost to the functionality and morale of players for the game. Also, it'd be nice if the game could still get updated from time to time. I know Primal Carnage: Extinction gets a lot more attention these days, but it'd be nice for this original to still get some focus and tweaks every now and again.   Other than that, I absolutely love the game! I'm always a bit of an achievement enthusiast and theres quite a few for Primal Carnage that I definitley like as they'll be fun and challenging to acquire! Anyways! So much fun, and after seeing and enjoying the hype for Jurassic World, there's a good chance most everyone playing with you is out to have a great deal of fun as well! :D So come on and take a chance with us!",

I quickly ducked into a side alley, turning in time to see the leg of a Tyrannosaurus, another live player, running past. After a moment it returned, roaring and thrashing, trying to reach me at the back of the alcove. My gun rang out shot after show along with my screams of equal terror and delight. The beast retreated, returned at an angle anew. My gun clicked out of ammo just as the great reptile's head burst deep into the alcove, pulling me screaming out into the light where it finished me off with one swift gulp. Simply awesome. Its one of those games where you can really find yourself immersed in the action...or sometimes, lack there of. I spawned during one playthrough, again as a human, deep in the dense woods, far from my other team members. As I treked aimlessly through the for forest in search of someone, anyone, my mind raced with thoughts of what foul things may be stalking me from behind or even above. It's moments like this that make this game great.

It is one of the best games I've ever played the Dino are the fun team humans are meh. The maps are very butieful and the dinos skins look quite real. But the dinos and human should have another class like a titan class for both sides for the humans a GUNMAN a large slow guy with a mini gun and a granade launcher and for the dinosaurs acrocanthrosaurus bigger than T-rex and faster his attack would be a chomp and a tail wip but each team can only have one titan at a time! But there is one more thing that I wish was on here just a deathmatch! Think of it humans vs humans Dinosaurs vs Dinosaurs it would be cool!

A Rex, for example, is not manouverable, so you can just jump to the sides and try to outrun them at edges. Raptors are quick but if you focus you'll get them quite easily, same with pterodactyls and the spitting dudes. The dinos with the horns (Carnotaurus? Allosaurus? idk man) are also avoidable with the same tactic as with the rex. The problem is that people come here expecting a CoD with dinosaurs, but that's not what this is. Of course if you camp on a rock or walk out alone you're going to die, there's literally carnivourus dinosaurs out there you idiot. All the dinos have special abilities activated by them roaring and rex can tilt it's head up and down to get enemies above them and on the ground. The survivors are definetely not in a disadvantage, you just have to stay in packs and you will have the upper hand. a couple of pathfinders, trappers and some black, brollic machine guy dudes and you can easily take down a rex.  Considering this, anyone that has given a bad review should definetely give it another shot, just don't expect a CoD or a Battlefield, this is Primal Carnage.",
