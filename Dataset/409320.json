            "review_text": "Syndrome is a survival horror game in a sci-fi environment.   You are a citizen of a starship, when you wake up you are confused, but its only an effect of the cryosleep, But no all so easy, you are not seeing any people around you, its strange. You are receiving a radio signal from other crew member and after this you know: at the ship something happened very strange and scary and almost of crew members are dead. So this is the short story of the game, begins in this order what i wrote, well the story is not very original, but not bad, especially interesting when you read notes/logs and messages at computers.    Gameplay is not bad, the controls are enough easy, but the combat system is bad, especially the close combats. Also I should mention a map also not the best, sometimes hard to find out if you are look at it. Also the tasks are sometimes to foggy.The game save system is based at terminals in game, when you want save, go to the terminal and 'put' your hand.   The game graphic looks awesome, and bring great atmosphere, also a good sound effects do an atmosphere even greater and creepier.   So my verdict   + great atmosphere + wonderful graphics + lot of interesting text to read about crew + steam achievements and trading cards   - very slow loading time - still have bugs - week combat system     Syndrome is a awesome horror game, so if you are a fan of this genre you must try its out, however, this game is not perfect, for example the combat system is enough week, also a map not very friendly. Another enough frustrating thing is the long loading time. But if you are can close the eyes for this problem, you will get enough good horror atmosphere with wonderful graphic.",

            "review_text": "Syndrome takes places on a spaceship in trouble, and your character must run around and get it going again.  What seems to be happening here is basically the Event Horizon movie in game form. I haven't played to completion at the time of writing this review, but it seems quite clear that the crew encountered something which drove them completely, hellishly crazy. You read accounts of crewmembers purposely disfiguring and dismembering themselves with a smile, adding how things are better without eyes, or simply laughing gleefully. It's really quite disturbing, as Event Horizon was. There are a number of enemies that you can either fight with your weapons, or hide from (though 90% of the lockers in the game are unopenable or you can't fit in them). These enemies are grotesque and seem to be melded with technology.  Despite being absolutely creeped out by this game with a 90% chance of never finishing it, I have to recommend it because what it does for it's genre, it does well. Spoops are well set up, eg one mysterious creepy object here, BAM a pile of bloodied bodies next turn. The hallways are dark and full of terrors.  TL;DR: This game is basically the Event Horizon movie in game form.",

There are still features you would expect to see such as being able to remap keys but the devs respond well to emails and are listening to community requests which is such a breath of fresh air compared to some larger studios as well so all in all it gets a thumbs up from me. :)",

The balance changes a bit once we get the guns, but still it never gets easy which is a plus for me. Has a few glitches here and there but nothing major.
