There's no technical shortcomings to the game, and it's proficiently interactive where you can enact your will on the game quite visibly (Though it was a tad bit on the short side in terms of length.)  My problem is more in the way that the game is written in a way that's not friendly to people who are unfamiliar with the craft sequence world, of which I have not read a book of. It's intimidating and complex, and it doesn't ease you into it, or explain itself enough. If you've already played through the other game in this series, 'Choice of the Deathless,' without issue, then this won't be a problem either, as I can say my experience with that was very similar to what it was here.",

Or about selling your soul in exhange for decadence?  Massive fan, definitely worth the price (As is  Choice of the Deathless , another game set in the same universe).",
