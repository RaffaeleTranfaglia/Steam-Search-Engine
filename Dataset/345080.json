            "review_text": "If you have read the store page, and watched the trailer, you will know what your in for. basicly your goal is to put the fire out, recover as many people and cats as you can, and make miss ion happy (that kinda is the only painful thing about the game) being a 'rouge inspired' game mechanics wise. its unlikly that two runs will be exactly alike. however I do feel this game has understood what makes this kind of gameplay good and addopted it to the firefighting gameplay. while its not with out its flaws, its a very well focused game that knows what it wants to do  the actual gameplay is great because it gives you the rules upfront. this is a race to the 16th level, (of which each 4 represenets a zone, with a set style) on top of that, you have a few diffrent tools to work with up front (as in your not compleatly weak to everything from the start) not that its not hard. but its not unfair from the start. when you first spawn in a level, the timer is stoped until the green door is opened, giving you time to check the map, see whats in each area of the map. while this game has a kinda awakred camara, the green door gives off a glow even off screen so you can find your way back to the exit with out needing to look at the map all the time. the time limit is really there to keep you moving and is the major threat in this game, fire will not do damage to you, until you sit near it for too long, and as such, it punishes you for rushing into a deep blaze (though sometimes you need to to get civs out before they die) the other main form of damage is the overheateded doors which you will know because of the fire at the base of them, if you open them, they expload on you. usualy there is at least one cat per floor so you can get hits back if your decent enough.   where this game gets hard is as follows. when time runs out, the reaper shows up and chases you around the level, if he hits you, its game over. though you can still get your loot back if you make it to that level in one run. but while its posable to dodge him, most new and even experanded players would rather have more time on there clock. civs and cats die very quickly, if you get the defibulatior items, its posable to revive humans, but, you can only do it twice, after which they are dead. cats can no be revived if they go down, not that easy to see them ether. in a room with fire, when you enter, only then do the other charators start taking damage, but there is a coughing sfx to make sure you know there is someone there, cats might have a small sound effect, but I cant here it. the game drops 10sec for every person you let die. no penetly for cats as well all know they have more lives elsewhere. there are also electrical fires which are used to force you to chose between going for the plug box, or going elsewhere first. while you can put them out with the foam (not the water) it often takes a while, and many times its easy to put all but one out, then have a random fireball set all of the electric fires back alight, which makes everythign take so much longer. thankfully once you hit the fuse box, all of them dissapear   miss ion and the progression system, she is a npc who like others can die, however until you do her mission (terible I know) she will not follow you, each mission on the floors she appears on are always the same. (floor 1, one red bag, 3 5 files and post it in the red post box, 5 find the valult and loot it. however once compleated, you get a min and a half of time then and there, and she dropes a ion token, collect them so you can unlock more perks  the game has around 7-8 perks, aside from the first one, you need a set number of ion tokens to unlock them, then you can spend some of your money to upgrade them up to 4 or so times, most of these really help you out in small simple ways. but. they really dont add that much to the game out side of giving you a reason to do the miss ion quests. if I had to say there was any bad points to the game, its that the missions are trivial and annoying, as all your doing is moving around near objects and pressing f. but at least its not interfearing with the game play at all and can be done fast. I am sure some people like it more then others. its never needed, but it can help.  the games difficulty goes up each stage set by not only getting slightly larger, but also expanding the size of the fires in each room. every 4 levels changes the theme (1-4 is office, 5-8 is ex rooms, 9-12 is the lab, 13-16 is the factory) each zone adds more flamable material, thigns which spread fire in more dangrous ways, as well as the 3-4 zone adding extra hazzerds. this makes it very hard to beat all of the levels, however you will be able to start at any stage if you want. once you have gotten to it once.   the soundtrack is for the most part really good, though each zone has only one soundtrack, when you get low on time, it changes to the panic form and stays there until you at least get one min of time on the clock. the theme of this game is amazingly fun, being very uk. I do find the audio to be very good with the exception of the looping on the spray for both foam and water. it tends to have weird pauses instead of being continuis fully, however these can be fixed. for a indy game its pretty well done though it has bugs.  the only downside is that there could be more room types. and the difficulty goes down alot on the early areas with pratice. to the point of sometimes feeling trival. and often most rooms are not that hard. however, there will always be that one room which is a jerk to you. and I do think that a bit more work could be put in to make the map generator a bit more consistant.  the developer is active on the forums, there was a day one patch which did make the game better, and its clearly a soild product. i can recommend this game to people who want somethign that works, and plays well. as always check the forum and do your reserch, watch a video or two to get a good idea about how it plays and if you will like it or not.   I give this game a b+, very solid, while still having room to improve.",

            "review_text": "This game's novel approach to difficulty makes it unusually engaging. This is not a game you will sit down and complete in a single game. Make no mistake, this game is CHALLENGING and you will fail, repeatedly. But nor is this game inordinately punishing in the vein of an actual roguelike such as NetHack. A large part of the progression comes in terms of your own personal skill and strategy, which will develop over multiple play-throughs.  There aren't many games about firefighting, and this one does it in comic, challenging style. It deserves more players.",

It does not forgive, it is difficult. You have to react quickly to every room. This game through the last stage turns into a fast pace game not only would you have to blow out fire but save civilians and cats as well as collecting items and doing important side missions.   So get this game if want a bit of good challenge twin stick shooter.  Ps. I recommend playing this game with controller.",

            "review_text": "I really want to recommend this game. I'm not going to describe the game in general because many others have already. I like almost everything about this game, except the upgrading system, and in my opinion, it breaks the game. The upgrade system that allows Blaze to power up is fine, but is quickly maxed out. The problem is with the 'per game' upgrade. Once you get to Level 3: Labs, if you don't have certain shop items that randomly appear, you will not proceed, no matter what you do. Difficult is one thing, being put continuously in a situation in which you cannot proceed is not fun.   After playing for 22 hours, I've gotten the magic combination ONE time. And, when I had this combo, I encountered a hazard I had not seen before and it instantly killed me, even though I had at least 3 hearts remaining.   As I said, I REALLY want to recommend this game, but because of the poor upgrade system, it becomes more frustrating than fun.",
