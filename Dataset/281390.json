Some may find the pace too slow for them (I would think those that love games like Star Craft would be who I am referring too) but if you ever played EVE Online and loved to mine then this game's pace will be perfect.  The focus here is on strategy rather than massive battles and big explosions. This is also still the only game of it's genre that has dynamic play fields as far as I know.",

            "review_text": "Trust me, you want this. Game is AWESOME, but hard. Better than most modern games, actually. Graphics are excellent, plays very good on older hardware. Races are pretty different from each other to require different playstyle. THIS is what needs to have GOTY and awards.",

O.R.B is a good game but not as good as homeworld however its just a shame homeworld not on steam cries for these reansons and other reasons i give O.R.B a personal rating of 8/10 it was good but personally homeworld was better",
