I like the look and music, but I have to play it in small quantities or else my patience wears thin from waiting to get the right color and angle (and item, GIVE ME MULTIBALL OR MINES, dangit!) to clear out the viruses. It's cheap, so I can recommend it if the look fits your fancy and you have the patience for it.",
