            "review_text": "When The Division was teased for people to get them hyped, the game looked amazing. They promised so much and gave a hell of a show when promoting the game. So we waited. We sat on our hands in order to keep from clapping at the idea of being able to roam around in a world so vast and changing, acquiring loot, meeting friends, and forming expansive teams along the way. The game looked awesome and boasted a lot of things to occupy your time. Then....it released.   Graphics were dumbed down. Gameplay was repetitive. There was no guild/clan features. Matchmaking was buggy. Weapon and Gear bonuses and stats were incorrect. The plot of this game shifted from fighting in an environment that was devastated by a virus to more of a giant bug collection where you fumbled and crawled your way through all the pain brought on by the issues in the game just to experience what it was like to level up. And Ubisoft/Massive did little to help. Even now, after rolling out patch 1.2, they have broken more than they fixed. In fact we're all sure that they fixed nothing and uploaded a compiled file of bugs into the game instead. So let's list what we have here. Please read this carefully before you ever consider purchasing....or even playing for free.   Pros ::  - The Game looks gorgeous - The equipment system is lovely - The personal appearance is pretty entertaining - Static clutter and objects are plenty and not stationary. (Shoot that rat. Smack that lamp) - The sounds are great. The ambience is just intense with headphones, which is good. - There are plenty of missions to choose from for the first 30 hours - The weapon modification system is nice  - The gunplay is pretty decent  Cons :: (Hold on to your hat) - There are bugs. Bugs everywhere. I mean seriously, this game is made of bugs. - There is no customer service - Patches break a LOT more than they fix - Gameplay is VERY repetitive - NPCs can shoot through walls - Players get locked out of instances - Upon joining a match, there is a high chance you will fall through the map, get teleported out, and fall again. - Graphical bugs left and right. You'll see the poly blocks floating around where fog should be, etc.  - The storyline is extremely boring - The game is nothing like the trailers. It has been dumbed down - The content you see from the E3 promotions? Totally inaccurate - The NPCs are all pretty much the same, only some have flamethrowers and some have armor.  - The loading screens are EXCESSIVE. Every single thing you do prompts a loading screen. If you join a group from matchmaking, you load for 2 minutes. They can kick you during that 2 minutes. So your load screen resets before you even load in and, what, you're dropped where they SHOULD have been. Then it teleports you back to a safehouse and you load for another 2 minutes. Even for High end PCs, the load times are far too long and there is a sickening amount of things that call for them. - The Matchmaking, frankly, sucks. It will not match you with people within the range of your gear. So if you're trying to gear up, it just tosses you in an open slot. And if that group is geared and they don't like that you're not, you get booted. This makes joining groups for getting into the DZ and missions in order to even get gear HARD. Of course, you get kicked and get to see those neat load screens. - The latency is iffy. I personally run on a fiber connection and the amount of lag that I see is ridiculous. You'll watch people scoot down walls. You'll see yourself teleport several feet from where you took cover. You'll unload 4 complete magazines into an enemy and do no damage only to see the damage pop up on him 20 seconds later after he's killed your teammate. Etc. - The cover system is ALMOST acceptable, but it's not. Having your cover system default to the same button as your roll button is just bad. You'll try to move into cover and roll right past it. Or attept to roll away from a grenade damage zone and take cover instead thus killing you. - A lot of the NPCs are overpowered. This game is punishment if you have to fight a group of NPCs that have shotguns. Not only can they 1 shot you, but they have armor. And they don't take cover and play smart. They RUSH you without regard of their own health. You have to pray that you and your group (if you have one) can kill them before they get close.  - The DZ is boring. It's a lot of running around, shooting NPCs to get another level ladder crawling up, hoping you get loot. Then you get it, try to get back to extract it, and bam : some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is leagues above you kills you JUST to kill you. But, the DZ is one of the better places to get gear. Well tough ♥♥♥♥. Then again not a lot of people go Rogue since there's no benefit from it. The DZ is just boring. - It's also impossible to get a good DZ group unless you just run into someone in there and they decide to join you. Matchmaking is useless for this. Seeing as you cannot matchmake inside the DZ makes it even more useless. You had best hope you find another lonely soul that doesn't just shoot you on sight. - There is no endgame. Once you hit level 30 and fill out your equipment with Highend equipment....eh. You can go after and hunt the gearsets, but that's really just doing the same mission over and over and over and over and over and over and hoping that if something drops it's not the EXACT SAME THING you already have. Besides that you get a couple of dailies. Once you complete those (About 15 minutes) you're too bored to continue playing. - There is no clan/guild system. You can't do something as basic as create a clan/guild name, invite friends, and have a system to talk to people when in game. Oh no. you have to relay your conversations through Uplay IF you can meet anyone that plays in game....because, really, the game is pretty much dead.  - Lastly for my list is that Ubisoft/Massive doesn't care. They promoted this game. They promised so much. They have so many resources available to make this an amazing experience...but they don't. Bugs that are gamebreaking are left in the game. Right now if you join a group, your UI doubles and you can't use it. This has led to people losing items. Gear. Skills being changed mid fight and wiping a group, etc. Where is the company? Where is the customer support? They're nowhere to be found because they have the money and that's the end of it.   This is an example of a DECENT enough game that's good for wasting time, if you're bored and have nothing better to do, that could have been great. Ubisoft/Massive failed this title. They got everyones hopes up, sold the game, and backed off. When other games do this, they get taken down from Steam and there is a widespread refund spree, but not in this case. People are still PRAYING that it gets as good as it should be and hold on by the skin of their teeth...but it won't. It's like they have 5 people who work on this title...2 days a week...for a few hours...and only if they want to. They let the community down. They let the Tom Clancy name down. They let every single person who spent $60 on this game down. And not because they didn't give us a decent platform to start with...but because once they realized they messed up they quit caring about it and us.   The Divison has been broken since day one. Almost everything they promised they removed. It's not as lush, vibrant, and expansive as they promised it was. We got the Bait and Switch. Now it's struggling to maintain an 8000 playerbase. So before you spend your hard earned money on this title...just don't. This is the game that COULD HAVE BEEN amazing, but it wasn't. This is the game that robbed us of our enthusiasm. This is the game that is dying a very sad and lonely death. You can argue that if you get an hour playtime for every dollar that you spent on a game makes it worth the money, but it doesn't. At 70+ hours, I saw all this game had to offer and am just..disappointed.",

            "review_text": "When it has all been said and done, I think most reviews and the criticisms of the The Division are warranted.   To sum it up in a nutshell, The Division is to gaming history, the most wasted potential videogame of all-time. It has an excellent premise, but it is poorly executed in not only gameplay, but story, environmental and level design, and NPC interactions, or lack thereof.   The lack of an anti-cheat system leaves you wondering what Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft were thinking during the planning, strategy, and conceptualization stages of development. Not only do hackers or players without a conscience continue to exploit this game, Massive has denounced a statement saying that an anti-cheat system is basically out of the question because 'we would need to build this game from the ground up again.'  Unlike some other The Division early adopters, I was never butt-hurt by the E3 gameplay, or the mad and sickening hype. Unfortunately for me, I do not understand why some blatantly obvious game designs were not in this game.   The streets of New York City is barren, even as pre-apocalyptic or apocalyptic world. Ubisoft and Massive should have opted for a ficticious city instead of a realistic New York. Trading a videogame fantasy world for a more realistic one is one of the major drawbacks to The Division's level and environmental design. The problem with this is, you have very little to work with because the developer tried too hard to be true to New York City's landscape, leaving little to the imagination.  The loot system is severely flawed. The 'Gear Rating System' Massive has in place is misleading. For example, a player can have a gear rating of 204, but have less damage per second, health, or skill power than a player with a gear rating of 190. Basically put, the gear rating is skewed and distorted.   I may not know everything about MMO-like or MMO videogames, but I have played my fair share. In that, I have some credibility as a gamer who once appreciated MMOs and especially MMO-RPGs like Dark Age of Camelot, World of Warcraft (golden days), Warhammer: Age of Reckoning, Guild Wars 1 and 2, and modern ones like The Secret World. While I draw comparisons, I want to say that the MMOs I mentioned at least tried to bring in new game mechanics and MMO worlds that brought 'something new' and most importantly, fun gameplay and loot. The Division features loot as guns and 'gear,' which in some sense it does well. The character design is pretty to look at and the clothing, equipment, and armor all look great aethestically but nothing more.   The Division relies heavily on crafting and farming Pheonix credits which you would then trade in to a vendor to purchase new weapons, equipment, or blueprints. At the moment, players have to rely too heavily on crafting gear in order to take on the only incursion we have in the game. Daily assignments are few and far in between, so you would have to complete the daily assignments for Pheonix credits every day in order to rack up hundreds of credits to purchase the gun or blueprint that you need to pack any kind of punch for an incursion. *Massive did state with a recent update that they are attempting to remedy this issue. We will see about that.  MMOs have instances or dungeons and this is typically the meat of the endgame where players farm for loot or gear. Ubisoft/Massive 'gave' us an Incursion called 'The Falcon: Lost' as a free update. This is the problem and plague of the current situation of the videogame industry. 'FREE UPDATES' and what is it, really? The base game of The Division before the Incursion update was barebones as you can get. Very little content, as in, a few missions, and nodes on the map that would give you vertigo, thinking about Assassin's Creed's nodes on the map that induced OCD. This is probably the most shallow aspect of the game besides its story and NPC interaction in story mode.   On another note, The Division lacks any sense of threat. You never feel like the city is lost in shambles; not even in the Dark Zone, which is suppose to be the darkest corners of the game. Like I have said before, the game design falls short immediately when the player does not feel any sense of threat, urgency, and motivation to bring cause and effect to attention. Because simply, there is none. And that in itself is a sad fact of the game.   The Dark Zone is lackluster, full of hackers, and wasted potential. In DZ, you are doing the same thing over and over, and if you are expecting the dynamic of human vs human or PVP interaction in the same vein of DayZ and like games, you will be very disappointed. There are too many hackers. The punishment and reward system is severely flawed and it does not reward co-op players. One simple rule, as with past MMOs or MMO-like games is simply this: ADD A PVP TOGGLE ON OR OFF OPTION. It is that fvking simple.  You may be wondering why I have invested so many hours in The Division and have the audacity to 'thumbs down' the game in such hypocritical fashion. It's quite simple. I review games after I have given enough game time, especially when it is an MMO-like-style game. It is only fair. After a handful of updates with the addition of the 'free' incursion, and Massive's inability to resolve the glaring issues in the game, I cannot recommend it to anyone at this price point. I cannot even recommend the game for $1 because it would be a waste of your time. You are better off spending your time doing other things. Seriously. I mean this sincerely.  I could keep writing, going in to 'massive' detail about what should and should not be in The Division, but it would be an overwhelming task that only my mind can understand at the moment. Most players would agree that The Division is a huge wasted potential. The proportionality of negative to positive reviews is not only valid, but almost sound if you were to ever experience such disappointment without reconciliation of the fact you just wasted not only your hard earned cash, but also your valuable time.  Verdict: Not recommended. Avoid until Massive and Ubisoft implements an anti-cheat system and addresses and resolves several issues in the game. While I understand this is Massive's first roundabout at a game such as this one. It comes with its own challenges and complexities which deviate from the standard and traditional single-player and multiplayer affair. Even though I cut Massive some slack on that front, there are far too many minor and major issues Massive continues to overlook, which leaves me to question their approach and strategy to fix some of the game's many problems.",

Played mostly solo because my friends simply didnt had the patience to understand this game mechanics and gear system, playing solo it was painfull ... its not fun being chased around by groups of players just killing you just because they could. 1.3 almost destroyed this game, and the devs saw that ... and what they did on this game is nothing short of amaizing, they actually listened to the people playing it and fixed most of the isues, respecting what the community was saying. 1.4 its a revolution on the game mechanics, and made the game balanced even for solo players like me. And now ... 1.5 and survival. Survival its amazing ... everything that it didnt matter in game before it matters now ... water, food, meds ... the gear that was cosmetic only now has a purpose ... starting outside the DZ and making your way there it actually feels challenging . Even in this time the devs are making questionaires on what the community would like to see in The Division, the devs could have simply let the game die ... but they didnt. I give them respect for that, and for listening to the ones playing it accepting all the critics and improving the game vastly. I was waiting for this for my review. If you get this ... make shure you get the gold edition with the season pack, its half the price now and survival alone is worth it. But hey ... i know nothing about games, im just a noob having fun. And this game just got fun !",

Just so you guys know how playable the game is now compared to launch and up to 1.3, I bought the season pass yesterday because I knew I'd have FUN playing this game so It was a nice deal and the Season pass is almost as expensive as the game,so yeah.   I rate this game (currently 1.4 patch) a 7/10, enjoyable with friends,fun and challenging when you are alone. Cons:The game needs EVEN more backstory to it,I find this whole scenario fascinating, to the point where I want to learn more more and more. Playing in the Dark Zone alone,is very risky, there needs to be a way so that if you are solo in the DZ,you get a small buff or something to help you run away from groups of rogues,maybe if you are alone you move (Insert percentage here) faster than everyone else. Pros: With friends AND the Underground DLC, this game has a 8/10 level of replaybility and daily play so you know grab a few friends and play it.Incursions which have very nice loot and daily rewards encourage partnership between players,which in turn makes making friends easier.  That is all,my honest opinion,I've hated this game and I felt ripped off by Ubisoft, but now I can say that I will get my money back in playtime. Thank you all for reading.",

So much potential, and a great foundation, but it's another AAA title released with little-to-no content, and you will likely have to spend over $100 to get a decent experience with future DLC. Not only that, but there are so many stupid bugs that are still in the game that SHOULDN'T be after an alpha and two betas.   There are also cheaters around like mad in the Dark Zone.  A beautiful world... but it's so barren. There's almost no reason to free roam the map, as there are no real random events on the map. I just can't help but feel disappointed with what could have been.  As of now, stay away and avoid like the plague.

Probably a dozen times. I know I have. You've cleared the building before. You've swapped your gear for more gear. You've opened the shiny loot container for a bandage that you can't carry. There is nothing new or innovative about this game. It's the same old thing in a new shiny package. It has crafting. Of course it does. Everything has to have crafting these days. Lots of long runs to the next objective. Cause none of us have played any hiking simulators in the past few years. Talent system with special powers? Obviously. Special powers in a   cover-based tactical   3rd person shooter...  The gameplay is extremely easy and I find it deeply unsatisfying. The overwhelming majority of quests are kill quests of one degree or another that provide little challenge. The third person view and cover based mechanics directly clash with each other. It's not a shooter. It's Zeus hurling lightning bolts. You can see everyone at all times, all their movements, preparing to throw a grenade, when they pop up, when they go down. You can shoot with astounding accuracy over cover without exposing yourself. And should an enemy actually be hidden, don't worry, theres a superpower that gives you xray vision.   On the point of upgrading gear, they've found a way to make it even less satisfying than its been in all the other games we've been playing since WoW. They seperated the gear with stats from the gear that alters appearance. Ignorning that the majority of the 'appearance gear' looks largely similar, now you have two gear screens that you have to maintain and more nonsense sort. What that achieved for me is making it so that I completely ignore my characters appearance. Well done.   Personally, I don't think this game deserves the hype or the success it's recieving. But that's the state of gaming today isn't it? As much as I dislike this game, it's probably going to be one of the best titles to come out of the next month or two.   With the recommend buttons looming below my ever-growing review I'm forced to concede that if you are as disillusioned as I am about the state of gaming these days then you must admit this game does not deserve your support. But what else is there? If you are interested in this game and are willing to knowingly pay more than it is probably worth... then it's ok. It's ok because we don't have a better benchmark right now.   tl;dr This game is like another Wal-Mart popping up in your home town. You know it's not good. You'd rather it wasn't there. But Wal-mart has shiny graphics and it runs well on your PC. So it's not the worst thing in the world to shop there. But your money is better spent elsewhere.  *edit - some commas and some words",

If you played EverQuest and lost your corpse at the bottom of a well, have enjoyed raiding on a WOW pvp server and getting corpse camped, spent time in 0.0 space in EVE Online getting blobbed by goons and doing calculus in spreadsheets to determine builds or like just like a Diabloesque never ending loot grind then you'll probably enjoy the Division like I do because at its core this game is a Third Person RGP with many MMO elements and influences.   You'll have to grind for gear and the RNG is real. You might farm the same bosses for hours to obtain the BiS slot items and rolls. The incursions (raids) are tough and you'll need to follow a shifting meta of BiS gear, group up and learn game mechanics to be successful. Sometimes the content and the meta to beat it isn't very fun but that's the nature of the beast.  Just like any MMO if you try to PUG difficult content you're going to end up being match made into a group of Leroy Jenkins's and have a bad time. This means that some content/items are simply out of reach for some players due to bad RNG, not having a group or just being really bad at avoiding red circles on the ground.  The game has a core game play component (the dark zone) that is a PvPvE zone. The best loot drops in the dark zone and it's the most efficient place to play, however, it seems like the current generation of gamers don't mesh well with PvPvE so before you buy this game you need to acknowledge that you'll be killed in the dark zone for your gear, rogues will cut your extract rope and steal your loot and they'll shoot you just for the hell of it; especially if you're solo. Most importantly you need to know that this isn't griefing; these are game play mechanics.    There are some legitimate complaints here re: stat and item scaling and lack of (efficient) farm PvE content but it is not fair to compare this to No Man's Sky at all. The game world is big and immersive with an incredible about of attention to detail. I have over 500 hours and still see and hear new things regularly. If you just run from waypoint to waypoint or fast travel you'll miss a lot of little details.  Lastly the developers have acknowledged that getting 1 shot isn't that fun and the scaling is a bit silly at the latest stages of the game. They have just added a Player Test Server and are working on a major game play patch called 1.4. You can login and play and see changes happening on a weekly basis and they are addressing most of the major issues with stat and item scaling.  Overall I've greatly enjoyed my time in The Division and hope this gives you a better idea of what to expect if you decide to purchase.",

Obviously with a game like this, it will always be quite difficult to play solo in the DZ. But if you choose your gear set and talents properly, you can actually somewhat manage. With the way the game currently is, I can reccommend it. Play with friends if you can though.",

Please... for the sake of your art and tech guys, who have realised a beautiful and visually interesting postapocalypic Manhattan, take a look at Bethesda's games for how to make open world titles that immerse and engage the player rather than make everything a chore. As a player there's a massive frustration in seeing something that could have been an absorbing and amazing game reduced to tedium by the design rather than technical or artistic limitations.  This is before we get to the darkzone stuff which is meant to be endgame, but there's still some clear design confusion over whether this is meant to be a long-term MMO or short-term story with multiplayer tacked on. It's a decent concept but at the moment broke in the implementation, and quickly becomes a grind with a clear risk/reward issue around going rogue. In terms of multiplayer (and overall game) longevity, this is Borderlands - there's some, but nobody still plays Borderlands now, right?  In summary, this is not a *bad* game, but comes frustratingly - visually and technically - close to being an amazing one, then is massively let down by game design to below mediocrity. ",

            "review_text": "- Early-access of The Division 2.0 with AAA price tag - Wait, what?! With all the hours poured in you downvote the game?  - Yes, I do   Review v 1.1    1. World   This stunning hand-crafted NY city is as beautiful as it is empty. When you grinding towards level 30, you are completing unique story missions along with absolutely unimaginative obligatory side missions. Upon completion of all the activities  (takes about 14 hours if you do not rush anything)  you are stuck with absolutely useless NY city. There are no real random or special encounters on the streets of NY after you reach level 30. It feels empty and I wonder why the put so many effort in decorating city which is 15-hours-long-and-the-gone.   2. Mechanics   There are a lot of bugs and inconsistencies all over The Division and they all add up to the overall frustrating experience we get as an endgame. From exploits that let players get the loot instantly and then troll the dark zone newbies to bugs with perks and talents, jammed guns and skills delay / miscasts / double cooldowns and so on. Sadly, there is nothing behind that cinematic beauty we have been fed up with but poor execution. I will not be detailed here as there is so much broken in the game that I doubt they can fix it even in a year.   3. Endgame   In my opinion the endgame in The Division is a non-stop mindless grindfest for items that you don’t care about. Maybe a little PvP on top but that’s it. You get the best gear and then you kill all the weaker agents in the dark zone simply because almost everyone are within the same 161+ gear score bracket.   3.1 Loot   Massive is simply screwing people about loot. I do accept that this type of game involves grind but not of extent that you farm dark zone, missions for tens of hours so you get   nothing   better in return. There are different kinds of problems with the loot but the core thing is it   not feels rewarding at all  .    3.1.1 Grinding   Believe me when I say this is a mindless grind. It really doesn’t matter whether you exploit or do not  (so you will have to waste enormous amount of time as I did)  it will take a lot of hours for you to get something useful. It would have been a bit better if you get a truck of useless stuff and then you make something useful from it. But no, the equipment is scarce even though it is complete crap in most of the cases. The   wow effect   will instantly vanish when you see that the first high-end / set item you get is actually worse than your epic purple. And the second, and then the third. Damn, what’s wrong with this game? Have they checked out Diablo 3 and Destiny lessons learned?  Want to add about Division Tech grind. Yes, you can farm it only in the dark zone and it will take ages for you to farm it even with boosted chance of drop because crafting takes so much of it for each ♥♥♥♥ roll you do that you can spend entire weekend for div tech farm ending up with nothing.   3.1.2 Crafting   Generally, crafting it is not a bad thing. Bad thing here is that it is the most reliable way of getting decent equipment. And the most reliable way is full of random. Random stats, random effects, random talents with 90% of them being completely useless. I am extremely lucky that I get best-in-slot guns after 10 to 20 rolls but still I have that amount of hours in because I farm materials for these rolls. I have seen people that exploited hell out of Hornet, Bullet King etc., rolled for hundreds of high-end vector and did not get a single decent one. That’s simply frustrating. With 1.1 update they aimed to divert people from crafting through.. increasing amount of materials required to craft. Well, that’s cool but it is not punishing at all for exploiters or for those who are already in decent gear (so they farm high-ends for materials) – it is punishing for those who are still level up. You can get decently geared in a day (of playtime) if you have a good team but that is almost a month for casual players  (assuming 10 hours/ week or less) . Okay, you trying to show people that crafting is not the best way but are there any others really? Sure you can farm DZ for high-ends quickly reaching a certain gear score within 180ish bracket and then slowly making it into 190ish bracket. You can farm Incursion for the 214 gear  (challenge mode) . With a good team you can do it in 25 mins but I guarantee you will fail at least several times beforehand.    3.1.3 Talents and stats   There are  a lot of useless talents and stats  on both weapons on gear  (say hi to additional experience gain for level 30 characters, but wait, do they need one after they reached the level cap already?) . There are a lot of stats that really doesn’t significantly add up to your survival skills. Useful stats and talents compromise something like 10% of all currently in-game. Weapons are simply imbalanced - there are obvious choices for PvP and PvE .   3.1.4 Gear Score   This is innovation made life so easier for.. who exactly? You think that higher gear score is better? Higher rarity of item is better? Well, think again. Same mistake was done in Diablo 3 before Reaper of Souls and here we go again. I have 191gs set items   WAY BETTER  than 240gs set items. And that’s not some weird one case – I still have a few 191 pieces I cannot improve after don’t-know-how-many times passed Challenging Incursion.   3.2 Skills and builds   I have experimented with builds for a while but there is nothing in game that really rewards altering your playstyle. Aside from playing technician on Incursion there is no point of other build than “SMG + M1A First Wave, Firearms + Stamina, Pulse + Heal + Survivor Link”. If you claim that your build is better,– you simply haven’t met SMG-M1A build of your level yet. Spend several hours tweaking your playstyle and equipment and you will see that there are clearly a set of skills that are better than others. There is no real balance here and the game is constantly pushing you to a certain way of playing. I have to mention  “exploit cover”  skill, or how Massive calls it – mobile cover. This skill needs to be deleted from the game (sorry, 1% of players) for the greater good.    4. Dark Zone   PvP experience at its finest - thought MassiSoft.   4.1 Area   While it looks big at first, you will soon realize how small it is. You will, literally, farm 4-5 spawn points for materials and div tech all days long. Shoot, extract, run, repeat. The chance of good drop is so small that you can play for 100 hours and get just a couple of decent items. And all glitches and exploits apply to this zone as well.   4.2 Gear score brackets   This system would be nice if we had more gs brackets. Currently, guys with 161gs  (~30 hours of play)  and 222gs  (~250 hours of play assuming best-in-slot gear)  are placed within the same zone and so the is how Massive defines PvP experience. A one-shot zone for everyone.   4.3 Cheaters   C’mon, Ubisoft. You are doing this to us over and over again. Anti-cheat system doesn’t exist in Ubisoft titles and this game follows the rule.   This list is in no way an exhaustive list of flaws but it provides the same impression I have about this game. Overall the  game is 5/10 at most. . Hope my review helps.   Disclaimer:  With all the words said, I still appreciate the work done and I know that developing games is not an easy job. It is just frustrating to see that another promising title turned into who-knows-what due to poor execution. Let's not be too harsh on developers - let them try to fix it.  Ubisoft is very good at marketing and innovating but they suck at execution so much that you will hate yourself for buying their game. Again.  Out of chars.",

A person will work all day to get from 80+ DZ rank, say 83 to 84 , and hacker shows up with saved teleport spots and drop you. The same thing happens if you go rogue too. You're honestly better off trying to farm NPC's with the horrendous XP they give you. Cause heaven forbid if you die you've lost the last hours work. That on;y way you can really defend yourself against the hackers is to A. Stay out of the dark zone, or B. get the hacks yourself but then you get reported and banned for trying to help police the game. The best part about the hackers is that even if you upgrade your anti-cheat, someone will find a backdoor and then the coder will probably make it undetectable if anything and it'll be right back in the game. Maybe there could be a conference between another company that has a badass anti-cheat system and there could be points. As for the mobile cover, this has been a complaint for quite some time and rather than disabling it, you choose to fix mundane things like not having people blow up the APC with sticky bombs in falcon's lost. Sadly, The Division used to be a game a highly recommended to my fellow gamers and now after playing some 300+ it's absolute garbage.

I am this close from shooting the dog in game. I like dogs but this game is really pushing me to my limits. My work is even more appealing that playing this crap game.   [PREVIOUS] The gaming experience is really terrible. One example is the inventory system. It defaults to sorted by quality. I honeslty don\\'t get why a gun of level 8 is on the top of the list than a gun with a higher level. Even the sorting between DPS is messed up. The game doesn\\'t say why this gun with a lower dps and lower level has more quality than a gun with a higher level and higher dps. The gun selection interface isn\\'t friendly either. I have to select each gun to see what type of gun it is. It isn\\'t sorted by type! I had to select one gun at a time just to know what type of gun I currently have. It\\'s just a pain!   Another one is that you have to hold the button F to do something. The feedback to a player isn\\'t very well designed. It doesn\\'t let the player know if you can now release the F key after holding it for so long. It doesn\\'t say that you have to hold the F key unless you happened to notice that little arrow in the upper hemisphere of the circle to know that you have to hold the F key!  And about the fast travel. Why is it the screen for confirming fast travel and actual fast travel is the same? What I mean is the moving arrow animation to the selected destination for both confirmation screen and actual loading screen! I waited 5 minutes just to notice that I have to confirm fast travel! I don\\'t mind the confirmation function but the ♥♥♥♥ing screen is the same! The only hint that you have that you actually fast travelled is that walking sound after the confirmation screen. It\\'s too soft to notice any difference!  I think the game idea is great but the user experience is so abhorrent.   Don\\'t buy this game even if Emma Watson or Emma Stone goes on a date with you.

Not to mention areas where my friends could walk through freely but I'd be blocked off by an invisible wall. My system surpasses the recommended settings and I even set everything to the lowest possible settings graphically. Still certain areas of the city would remain blacked out not like it was apart of the dynamic lighting but like certain levels weren't loading correctly... this was usually followed by being killed by an invisible NPC/player.   I haven't even made it past level five and I can't even finish one side mission. I would have really liked to sink my teeth into this game but with how it looks right now I'm just glad to have a refund. I may try it again when it goes free to play.",

I entered the key code just to find that it said not vaild. After getting upset with steam since most of their help is automated and trying to figure out what was wrong i gave up. I decided to refund the game, explaining that it was an invaild KEY CODE. little did i know that you can put the key code in directly once logged into UPLAY, in which it accepted. I played two hours and fourty minutes of the game leveling my character up to level four. Now while i was leveling up i received a notification that my account was going to be refuned. It was two in the morning before i received this notification, by this time i was already in bed. I woke up the very next day in the morning before class and tried to loggin to my Division account just to be stop and prompted to purchase the game again. Wow, The customer support is so bad. I have received my refund fast but i figured out how to enter the code so it will except it. While going through my Email this morning i found what was a concelation for the refund but it was refuned less than 4 hours later. which when i checked with my credit card company i will not receive the credit for a whole month so im out thoughs funds.

            "review_text": "I have to start by saying that I really did enjoy, I like the game's story and I thought that the missions itself were fun...   The end game content and the PvP is what is the bane of the game and has essentially made this game broken. What is worse is that every time the end game and PvP gets adjusted it get even worse.   I have many issues with the game and one of them being the crafting system for level 30 gear. When the game first came out the number of lower end material need to make one higher end material was the following; 5 green to make 1 blue and 5 blue to make 1 yellow. After the incursion patch and is still 10 green to make 1 blue and 15 blue to make 1 yellow. You probably thinking that this change does not sound so bad and it would have been fair if Ubisoft had adjusted the rate at which you get material, but no Ubisoft made it worse. Each material point on the map now only gave 2-3 items per box at a refresh rate of 4 hours per box. This was changed from the 2-3 items per box at a refresh rate of 1 hour per box. Also the weapon breakdown went from 2-3 material per item broken down to 1 material per item broken down. This change had two effects, one it made crafting into a grind and a joke as all the stats on an item you craft are random and you can only readjust a single stat. You’re probably thinking big deal why don’t you just make another item to reroll the stats, that a great idea if Ubisoft hadn’t jacked up all the prices for crafting. What cost 3 weapon material 5 electronic material now cost 8 weapon material and 6 electronic materials. The second effect is that it screws over legitimate players mostly. The cheater/hacker/exploiters don't need to craft anything, they just run the incursion on hard or run around screwing legitimate players in the dark zone. The cheater/hacker/exploiters are the ones running around with the best gear and killing people at random because they think it is fun.  Another issue is the vendors. 90% of the time the vendors just sell the same stuff over and over again and they don’t rotate the blueprints. Which means you can get 2 items from the new armor sets then you have to play the incursion or the challenge mission and prey that you get the piece of armor that you want. That would not be as much of an issue, if there were more ways than playing the bullet sponge filled challenge and incursion mission.   Another major issue is the PvP, dark zone. When the game launched it was really costly to go rouge and a lot of people we just cooperating for the most part. Now all the penalties for going rouge have been nurfed and you’re more likely going to get killed by some random hacker who is running around killing people for kicks because he/she is already maxed gear and does not need to go around and kill you to steel your gear. Ubisoft should have had multiple dark zones like they had shown when they announced this game a few years ago at E3. Different dark zones with varying penalties for encouraging people to be cooperative or not; This would have solved for the most part, the need to adjust the dark zone over and over again. I for one would have like to have multiple dark zones and have all the different bonuses/penalties for going rouge/ cooperative play.  *As of right now after the April 29th 'Ban Hammer' drop, the dark zone as it stands rewards players for being an a**. A PvP zone in which to get the gear you have earned to your inventory you have to call a supply drop. That mechanic is fine, but what isn't is that there are now groups of people just camping drop zones to kill anyone not in their group trying to extract dark zone gear. I have been gaming a very long time and I think this is the first PvP game where I have been actively punished for not being an assh*** in the game. Also why am I getting killed by people with a dark zone rank of 99, my question is why are they in the same dark zone as me, why did Ubisoft not separate people by dark zone rank and gear level and lastly how in the world did you get to dark zone 99 last month with all the rapid hackers in the dark zone without cheating. All these problem for the most part would have been fix if they had multiple dark zones. Also to that end why is it that the people who kill you and steal your stuff don't show up on a play log. The way it is now you can't really review your actions and you can forget about even look up the people that screw you over. Even if it is to see if they were legit screwing you over or using ill-gotten gains to screw you over. If Ubisoft wanted me to tell them if someone is cheating, Ubisoft should have given the average player the tools to look up the assailant at least on a basic level.  Then there is the incursion itself. It was sort of fun, but not. The enemies don’t really use any real tactics except for charge at you gun's blazing. Normal enemies just melt and die from level 30 weapons but the incursion is different and not in a good way. Every enemy now has the HP of a challenge mission boss and can do damage that is comparable to the average level 30 player but the enemy now have an accuracy rating of 100% stacked with a stability rating of 100%.   There are many more glaring issues, but the ones listed above irk me the most. The short end of it is don’t get this game as it is. It is very broken and not worth anyone’s time or money.",

The DZ is completely broken due to various reasons, which some of these reasons fall over into the PvE aspect too. This includes build diversity, which there is none. Glitches and hackers all over the place are completely ruining the game.   This game has a strong emphasis on loot, yet there is next to no loot. Most loot is worthless as the Meta is extremely small. The same can be said about the abilities. The incursions that just came out are completely uncreative and feel as stale as the rest of the end-game. It doesn’t matter because everyone is just using glitches in the incursion anyways. This game has a gorgeous replica of New York City, yet a massive chunk of it is not used in the end-game whatsoever. I recommend not anyone else to buy this game. Do your research before doing so. You’ll see my comments regurgitated here such on YouTube, forums, and other social media outlets. I will not buy another Ubisoft backed game at launch ever again. ",

HOWEVER, for me at least, the controls are a little strange, the city doesn't really 'feel' infected or broken, since npcs are casually moving about which makes me feel as if things arent so bad. The gameplay itself is repetitive, and in my opinion it just gets kinda stale. This game reminds me a lot of destiny, and tbh I wasn't much of a destiny fan.  SHOULD YOU BUY THIS?! +Sure, if you're a fan of destiny/like that kind of playstlye  Personally, I might give this game another try if it were on sale in the future.  I would totally reccomend Seige though, that's a pretty fun one. great gameplay,solid graphics etc. (the Uplay servers can be annoying sometimes though)  Edit: I forgot to add the story. I didn't like how you are deemed 'important' to the plot yet don't have any speaking lines, or ability to determine how to take on tasks. for example, you are told what to do, and what you do is very repetitive. go here. shoot people. go there. shoot people. you get the idea. this is also just my opinion, and there are games where this mechanic works better. for me though, i guess i was expecting more of a story from a game this hyped.",

Before buying this game, wait a couple of months to let the game go through its Phases, to allow it to thaw out and become less glitchy and broken. Lets talk about the Pros | Cons. Pros:  Very fun game with friends, Borderlands style loot, and same as destiny. Dark Zone is Heart pumping.   Cons: SO MANY GODAMN BUGS Incursions: Risk VS Reward is not worth it. Challenging is incredibly hard, and only a few have accomplished it Legitly,  Exploits (which i took advantage of cus im a dbag) End game is a huge grind, taking 15 crafting materials to get that one God roll, and then you find out that it was completely terrible.  Cheaters/No Anti Cheat still very buggy. Dark Zone is almost unplayable, due to cheaters, and glitches.  AI Teleport when you shoot at them. Loot is really not worth going in the darkzone is good, but still you have a chance of being demolished by exploiters and cheaters. It costs so much to make a good roll, (unless RNG Gods are on your side) theyre so many differnet things to list, but i got to do some homework. PS: dont buy this game if you want to have fun by yourself.",

Can a dev please explain to me why you thought it a good idea to give some random player in a group, leader with the power to unanimously kick whoever they want? I mean, a guy doesn't like your name? Kicked. Doesn't like the color shirt you're wearing? Kicked.  So I'm trying to load into a random group on clear sky, ok used to loading screens that's fine. Get into the group everyone is having the bug where you run into the mission area and get transported to the beginning. Ok we all leave group. Another loading screen. Alright I'm going to be patient because I want to try the new content and give this a chance. my gear score is 197, I get it not super high, but it is doable, I know this because I went 20 minutes through the mission yesterday before everyone got spam dced and we gave up. Ok so I join another random group, loading screen, load, I've been kicked already, another loading screen, back in safe zone. Alright well I'm sure that guy was just anal about things, lets give it another go. Loading screen, load, kicked already, back to safe zone. I can't do this game anymore, been patient but even outside of the bugs, which i don't mind giving developers time to fix, this god power you give to random people in groups is just a bad design decision.  This game is unique, exciting and fun, when it works. Right now it feels like archeage with some of these design decisions, rampant exploits (which are not resolved).

Once you go through the single player story the only thing left to do is grind in the pvp zone. Grinding doesnt have to be a bad thing, but theres no purpose. You can do the exact same thing you could do with a purple set as you can with a gold item set. Maybe you can do missions on challeng mode then? The same missions youve already run, in order to get better loot I guess... These are things that work in most MMORPGS, but not in the Division.

            "review_text": "This review will be short, as I can't really find much to say about this game other than what has already been said. I am terribly disappointed in this game. I have been looking for an awesome MMO for awhile now, ever since Conan Unchained and Guild Wars, this was far from anything even remotely palate pleasing. So without further bemoaning, but with more to come! here I go:   Character Customization - I haven't played in awhile, but if you're looking for even the most basic of basic customization options we have come to expect from MMOs, you'll be disappointed. Barely any customization can be made in hairstyle, or in appearance, barring minimal facial changes, with minimal variation. You can't change height or weight, either. Most starting characters will look very similar, and the only uniqueness to your character comes from boring looking articles of clothing you find throughout the world. I call them boring because they are drab, and all of them essentially fit into very few stock looks.   Weapons - Yeah, they look nice. That's about all I have to say about them. They have no 'oomph,' and there's not really a feeling of 'wow' or satisfaction when a rare weapon drops. Furthermore, there is no satisfaction to be gained from 'modifying' one's weapons - The suppressor does literally nothing when fighting the AI. You may as well just not use it.   AI - Horrible. You know how the AI in FEAR - a game that came out around a decade ago - reacted somewhat realistically in trying to flank the player and how the soldeirs utilized moderately realistic commands and voice chatter? Yeah, that's not here. The AI may as well be zombies. They run at you like rabies-ridden rejects with no modicum of realism to their behavior patterns. Now, I know, it's an MMO and the AI in MMOs isn't like in FPS game, but this IS a shooting game so I expected something more than just imbecilic....imbeciles..From taking over the same spots as dead guys, to charging like maddened bulls right at you - there is no semblance of realism at all. Moreover, they are generic, boring, bullet sponges. I can't think of a single unique element, or memorable element, among any of the standard enemies, or 'boss' type enemies. A player can empty an entire magazine into one and it'll take away maybe 2/3 of his health. To be blunt, killing the AI is not satisfying, it's boring.  Raids/Dungeons - No. I mean, you can join 'dungeons' with other players but it's just running through a generic building shooting guys. Then you shoot a boss guy. Since there are no defined classes, there's no challenge other than trying to kill the bullet sponges before they kill you. No teamwork is needed.   Audio is passable. A gun sounds like a gun, there are some generic, overused taunts and communications used by the enemies. Nothing immersive, especially when they repeat lines and run out in the open toward you like mindless zombies.   The atmosphere is not at all engulfing. I never once felt like I was actually IN a desolate city - well, I mean...I did feel it was desolate but mostly because the generic NPCs dotting the landscape may as well be cardboard cutouts that float around. They serve no purpose, and add nothing to the game. In fact, their artificiality is more frustrating than there simply being no neutral NPCs at all. There are set zones where there are enemies as well - no roving patrols. I can't think of any element of the world in this game that made me feel immersed.   Community - Anti-social from what I have seen. I can't blame them as there's no reason to socialize with other players, no incentive to band together(in the normal PvE regions, I didn't do Dark Zone stuff because of the claims of hacking and because I don't have anyone to venture to the dark zone with, again, I didn't make any friends here because there was no incentive to band together). In my time playing, the chat was dead, and I saw zero support for something akin to a guild.   Progression - About as dull and lifeless as every other aspect of this game. The player is required to gather certain items to level up portions of his(the gender neutral form of it, so don't be offended SJWs) 'home base.' As that happens, the player can follow a VERY linear progression tree that offers no freedom of choice whatsoever. You will always have the same level of skills as every other person who chooses a, for example, primarily 'healer' archetype - though being a healer is impossible as everyone can heal, and it's not satisfying because, well, no one cares if you heal them as they can heal themselves. You'll notice I said 'archetype' now, and before mentioned there being no defined classes - this is because there ARE 'trees' - if you can call 3 very basic options skill trees - and you can pour points into them...but I haven't seen it really matter across any of the 'classes.' Regardless of which of the bare, basic, trees you go down - you'll be lobbing grenades and spraying marshmallows in a frenzy just like everyone else who went a different path.   The amount of content here is also pitiful. I was bored of 'exploring' the 'open world' within 5 hours. Once you've gotten beyond the initial 'oh, this is kind of cool' factor, you'll be bored of the drab environment that never changes color palate.  Crafting - Pfffftshhh. Bahahahahahaha. Oh dear lord, oh please, don't make me laugh.   To conclude, I strongly advise you to look elsewhere if you want a good MMO with guns. This is far, far from that. Lacking even the basic skeleton of what makes an mmo successful - from a feeling of uniqueness to your character, to a sense of achievement in obtaining new weapons and armor, to any sense of progression. Even if you just want to pop off some zombie-like AI with friends, or try your hand at gunning down the 1337 hackers in the Dark Zone - you can DEFINITELY get that fix from better games. Avoid this one like - well, things that you find highly detestable..like brussel sprouts or something.",

The problem is if you are in the dark zone for more than 1 hour you will either encounter hackers or exploiters. Hackers fires from inside buildings where you are unable to return fire, exploiters are max geared, something that was supposed to take months to achieve but due to buggs was achieved within 24hours of the release of the gear.

If you set aside the enourmus amount of exploting and hackers int he dark zone your left with a game once again desgned for north america and europe. The supposed vast number of servers that where going to make it impenetrable to ddos attacks has only created a sea of lag for anyone outside of those locations. Couple that with an infinate number of bugs that take you to eithrt delt or mike errors makes this honestly one of the worst experiences in gaming i'ver ever had. As an avid mmo player i've never ever seen such lack of importance given to the actual gamer while the marketing department keeps feeding lies to all outlets that write about the game. I pray for the day where mmo's o back to the star wars galxies days where the player and his needs where the focus of developers and not shiny new dlc's that don't work half the time and who's actual game experiance is sooo lacking. Just once i wish a development team would focus on game a server stability before launch instead of trying to make as much money as posible while trying to fix the stuff that should not have been released in the first place. As this is obviously going to continue i find myslef on the verge of not only taking a break but a direct uninstall of the game, something i find sad since this game made me get back into gaming after a lul of almost 2 years only to be utterly disapointing. Good luck to all my international friends becuase while everyone ♥♥♥♥♥es at you for not avoiding the apc fire you'll know that its becuase by the time you even see the red circle it already hit you thatnks to the crappy servers for non american and european players.",

You name something, the game has issues with it.  Non static exp table, something is worth x 1 time and y another, I can restart 3 times and be 3 different levels at the end of each introduction.  Enemy hit recognition and damage, I can be shot by a level 1 enemy and lose like 3/4 of my health, and be able to tank face level 10+ enemies no problem.  Server connectivity issues, You'll be 'lucky' to finish a single mission without you or your team mates being dropped out of the game. I have been dropped and instantly reconnected 3 times already today.   I just got dropped out an attempt to take the power plant and reconnected DEAD.  THANKS UBISOFT.  This game has NO business being multiple player, let alone being online. What ever genius decided to make the 1 player mode ( and you WILL BE playing alone ALOT ) online needs to be fired.  I'd delete the game and get a refund but I can't, cause APPARENTLY steam only allows you to play a game for 2 hours before it becomes yours, and I had already played for 5 hours APPARENTLY at the time.  You know, cause any reasonable game player can make a 'fair and just' desicion about an ENTIRE game with only 2 hours play it. ESPECIALLY when the introduction to said game is 30+ minutes long.  All of this is completely ignoring the absurdly stupid !@#$, like being able to shoot through cars and trucks but NOT the 'bullet proof?' things like cardboard boxes and computers monitors... REALLY?  I don't even care about getting my money back at this point, seeing this game crash and burn as it deserves would be refund enough.  I havent even gotten started on all the glitchers and exploiters, which ubisoft's offical stance seems to be 'the ones who got away with it, got away with it.'.   Which means what exactly? !@#$ all the people who try to play legitimatly?  I had erased my last review, feeling I was being un fair to ubisoft, but !@#$ that. This game is !@#$ and everyone needs to know to stay away from it.  Small Side Note, someone questioned my having 237.8 hours of play time, fair question.  I have had this game since April 8th of this year and still have not logged even 10 days of play time on it. 237.8/24 = 9.9, 3.25 of the 9.9 days being in the last 2 weeks.  That should tell everyone all they need to know about how I feel about this game.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 08/24/2016  Review Update...   THIS IS STILL THE MOST WORTHLESS GARBAGE !@# !@#$ING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!  At the request of the friend who got me into this game, I gave it a 'fair' chance, and only have maybe 20 more things to talk !@#$ about.  Top 3,  1- the pvp system / area is !@#$ing GARBAGE, they claim to have 'tiers', which is !@#$ing pointless because any player regardless of level or pvp rank can simply change out his items to be allowed to enter whatever 'tier' he chooses.  2- the difficulty scaling system is even more !@#$ing GARBAGE then their so called 'tiered' pvp sytem. At what seems to be any time it feels like, the game randomly changes all the hostile npc levels, health, damage output to whatever it feels like. My map area zone is 'labeled' as 30-30, YET... all of a sudden out of no where every single npc in my map area was 33 or higher. Which if my 5th grade math serves me correct, is 3 levels higher than the designated maximum level for said area. HMMMMMMMMMMMMM?  3- their damage recognition programming is the MOST WORTHLESS !@#$ I have ever seen. You can shoot an npc in the head with every single bullet or sg shell or whatever you have and only 50%+/- will register as hits let alone actual head shots (which is suppose to inflict w/e extra amount of damage it is...). YET, npcs have never miss aiming, can inflict 1 shot kill damage from football fields away, OH OH lets not forget being able to shoot around corners??? I was hiding behind the corner of a hallway in the subway and somehow died to the npc that was down at the other end of said hallway... REALLY NOW?  My lateat and FINAL opinion about this game?  An eat its own feces monkey could make a better game by simply pounding on the keyboard randomly.  I feel ashamed and embarrassed to the highest extent of the words for every single ubisoft employee there is.  This project was by technicality *100%* in house, as in they own and operate every single operation involved in the production of this title.  Is this worthless pile of !@#$ the kind of work we should come to expect from them?",

All these hackers are using aimbot software that has instant kill on it and teleport. So all they got to do and have been doing is teleporting, killing everyone, then hiding inside a building till their rogue status goes down and extracting. So not worth the $100 price tag just to have to be facing hackers and never leveling up or getting the gear you need for the DLC. Which they have said multiple times you need the gear from dropzones to even survive in the DLC.  Yeah please take this serious and don't waste your $100 on this just wait for a better product.  Since the second Incursion install the game is worst, with bugs like DZ instant kill out of no where from NPC's and the whole you can get good loot outside of the DZ is a lie none of the new content outside of the Incursion yeilds any rewards for anyone who is rank 30 and DZ 90.

Fight enemies, do this, grab this, fight these enemies and fight a boss at the end. It became a point to where me and my friends knew exactly what to do and didn't even need to worry about the final boss. Another thing that I would like to comment about is the dark zone. Good idea, bad execution. The dark zone is fun, don't get me wrong, but it is not fun alone. Sure you have the excitement of going rouge and killing enemies for really good loot, but I fall back to my last statement. Its repetitive. This game takes a lot of grinding to get some good gear, and sometimes that time is just wasted into doing what? Getting good gear, going back to use the gear in a mission and repeat the process? That's it. And of course like every game you're gonna find better loot and replace everything. It will repeat.

            "review_text": "I could not, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone at the moment. The end game is entirely based around a forced PvP area(to acquire crafting materials referred to as division tech) that is plagued with hackers who upon killing you can cost you up to a half hours worth of gameplay in progress(since the PvP area has penalties for death whether or not you have killed another player).    The hackers themselves are not the reason I cannot recommend this game, it is the complete lack of transparency or visible effort by Ubisoft to crack down on the hackers. They are more concerned with punishing individuals who abuse the glitch filled PvE 'raid/horde mode' in a verbal and visible manner, than they are with fixing their forced PvP hack fest. The evidence of this lack of effort to crack down on hackers is evidenced in the sheer prevalence of it. If hacking was being properly tracked and punished, hackers would not be so prominent or easily identifiable in the manner that they currently are.    There are hackers that literally stream and post on youtube that are still playing the game even though they are open and provide evidence themselves that they are hacking. There is no fair play system that provides after startup checking of game files, and while this measure is not a fool-proof prevention method, it is a deterrent and can help track and more readily identify hackers to the game developers.    The companies(Massive and Ubisoft) claim to be banning hackers but if any true form of punishment was being handed out there would not be such an open and blatant disregard for the games ToS.   I thank you for reading this entire post if you have done so, and while the PvE aspect of the game is enjoyable, it is not feasible to play solely in the PvE area and be competitive with individuals that venture into the dark zone. I personally have 600 hours of gameplay invested, and in my personal experience the hacking issues are only getting worse as the game progresses. I encounter 6-7 hackers a day while trying to gain valuable dark zone levels, and in total have lost 367k dark zone experience to these individuals which equates to gaining levels 1-32(roughly) in the dark zone and (based on efficiency in farming DZ experience) roughly 20 hours of gameplay progress.   I urge you to add this game to your wishlist, but abstain from purchasing until the hacking problem has been fixed or they provide a viable end game solution to allow players to be competitive in end game PvE progress without a need to travel into the Dark Zone.   I have endeavored to provide a detailed explanation of why you should abstain from purchase at this time, and I hope that should you buy the game you are not disappointed when your end game DZ time comes and you begin to encounter hackers.",

I slam into the door and no option is shown for me to click on. Then I try the second door and same result. No option to exit.  Now, my two highest characters are locked out of anything because of this.  Conclusion: The Division is still one big pile of horse excrement.  (Edit2)The division, the kind of game that you'll grow a love/hate relationship with.  I love how I can min/max my character, acquire equipment in PvE/PvP to boost my e-peen, play at my own pace and enjoy what the game has to offer.  Yet, I hate how The Division can destroy those aspects of the game so easily.  I play PvE when I want to play at a steady pace and relax a little whilst doing so. It's entertaining and straightforward. Yet, there are methods that exists for cheaters to exploit and get ahead of the curve weeks before anyone else, then kick you should you try to enter their group because you're undergeared.  However, PvP is where all my time is invested. I can spend hundreds of hours trying to min/max my character, grind through hundreds of NPCs and open several boxes of loot, only for some overgeared guy who had been maxing out his character at the 200+ bracket drop his gearscore below 200 whilst still having his BiS gear on and enter the bracket where most has first begun their min/maxing then go on a killing spree.  Far too many errors, glitches and bugs exist in this game that completely nullifies my time invested and effort put in. The developers of this game are trying what they can to prevent said occurences, but it is becoming more and more clear for me that they have no idea how or just refuse to put in the extra work required to have a good game.   I am a stubborn man and it took me nearly 400 hours played to realize that no matter how much I hope, wait and pray that the developers will make it right the next update, only to be proven wrong and only more errors surfaces the ground.  My statement below still stands. People will cheat their way into ruinning your fun, in one way or another.  (Edit1)The Division, Cheat simulator!

I had been hyped for this game since the day it was announced, and here we are with the contentless, hacker filled, BORING game we have today. And I can tell you I have never been more dissapointed in Ubisoft than I am now.   The game is plain boring.    the final boss is a helicopter for ♥♥♥♥s sake    After I maxed out I had literally 1 reason to play the game and that was to get full gold gear which took FOREVER even with a full team because lvl 30+ missions were next to ♥♥♥♥ing impossible unless you had a solid team with communication. I understand that the game should be more difficult once your level is maxed out. But having an enemies health at such a high level where it takes 3 full mags from an almost fully upgraded gun is ridiculously hard and taxing.  And that health level applies to every enemy in higher level areas. I would legitimately kill 3 enemies with every single mag I had on my character and I would have to run all the way back to the checkpoint to restock, which as you can probably tell doing this over and over and over again for hours can get really, REALLY boring.  The thing that irritated me the most was that my friends who were one-two levels below me could not play with me due to the fact that enemies would absolutely destroy my friendly team-mates even if they were only 1 level below the enemy. Which means if you want to play with a friend you either had to wait for them to level up, hope you can carry their lifeless body through the whole mission, or help them in their missions that were way too easy. It mightve been me but the balancing was wayyyy off.  Watching the 4 year old E3 footage makes me cringe so incredibly hard because its terrible to see that something that couldve been groundbreaking and amazing turned out to be a boring, dumbed down destiny clone. Did I mention the story line was absolutely awful? I cannot tell you one characters name from the campaign. There is nothing memorable about any character in this game. I was even bored by my own character due to the lame appearance options. Oh but lets not forget, if you do want to look somewhat cool you could always pay more money for different costumes because after all, its Ubi were dealing with here.

Borderlands 2 was a looter shooter too, it had a repetitive gameplay also, but at least it had a great story, fun gameplay and fun side missions.

            "review_text": "Tom Clancy's: The Division (No Spoilers)  A pretty decent game, to say the least, but also a victim of a number of crippling issues that happen to ruin aspects of the game, most notably anything related to player versus player. Although these issues are far from what they used to be (cheating seems far less common, as I have not run into any recently), many of the existing issues relate to balance and have not been addressed so far.  Overall, I'd recommend this game - the PVE aspect of the game is fun and has been, thus far, time well spent in my opinion, especially with the updates that have rolled out. I do not, however, own the season pass and the DLC that fall under it, so I cannot speak for that content, but I have heard good things about it.  I'm recommending this game, but not at full price. The game should be played in short bursts, in my opinion, especially in the end game as gameplay can be tedious and repetitive (due to the nature of the game). I'll go into my main gripes below.  My main gripes concerning the following:     Time to kill is tiny. Compared to the Beta, which I enjoyed a lot, time to kill is often so quick that an entire squad can be decimated by a single person if they have focused on DPS. Even tank builds (extremely high HP) do not last too long, especially if they have any damage or electronics output (in other words, wish to be able to do anything).    Although not so much as an issue before, weapons like shotguns and LMGs seem far less practical in PVP than what would be expected. Shotguns may be tended to in the future, due to the coming stagger in PVP, but I do not believe shotguns will ever be on par with submachine guns (high DPS, close range and high crit), assault rifles (accurate, fairly high DPS, medium range) or snipers (if set out right, generally instantly gibs targets).    Dark zone, despite efforts made by the developers, is still focused on killing your targets as quickly as possible; at the highest levels, turning their hitpoint bar into a killfeed notifcation takes mere seconds, at most - there is little point in going high health, if you can deal enough damage to negate even the tankiest of tanks. Electronics is a bit of a mixed bag - some of the skills do hurt, but I've found that DPS trumps a large amount of raw damage (for example, a sticky bomb doing 100k+ damage in AOE is nice, as it hurts multiple targets, but 300k+ dps guns generally does better, especially when solo. Electronics with 3 DPS guys does seem to be better than 4 DPS, due to the ability to remotely revive and various buffs.    DLC items are of a static level, and so are not viable outside of the very early game. They are, however, fairly overpowered early on, but quickly become useless. This is specifically talking about packs and guns you get as part of some of the DLC packs - it would have been better if they were cosmetic 'skins' that can be applied to any item, or at least the items their skins are built on top of.    Developers... Lied a lot about of the game? I'm not sure if lied would be the right word, but they certainly were not entirely truthful. I'll explain; what they had shown in the E3 footage was largely pre-rendered and much was not included in the actual game release (I get the graphics downgrade, not abnormal). I'd call it false advertising, but whatever. I got a different game to what I'd seen and I wasn't happy at first, but I've come to like what I got instead. I still think the PVP was best during the beta, however. You can look up ubisoft downgrades video/s - people have done comparisons.   However, as I've gone into some of my gripes, I'll mention some of the stuff I do like.     Weapon selection is great - there is a pretty large selection of primary and secondary weapons, but sadly many of them do not hold up in the min-max environment that is the dark zone. More so when people have fine-tuned their builds over many weeks or months.    Unique PVE factions, and though you might get tired of seeing them over and over again, at least it isn't one faction and they do play differently from each other. They are all tied to the story, so I won't go into them.    Lots of missions to do, both with your friends or on your own. The PVE part of the game can be done solo, if you wish, but it is pretty easy to level ahead of the missions, therefore making them easy. However, many of the post end-game missions (which can be repeated) do not suffer from being too easy, and can be difficult at times, especially on challenging. You may want a friend or three when you hit the end-game.    TL;DR   It is a pretty good RPG casual PVE shooter, all in all, but not so great of a PVP game (looking at you, dark zone) due to balance issues.",

I really do believe that Ubisoft had become aware that this game was ♥♥♥♥ but decided that the 'money grab' was more important.

            "review_text": "This game will never become good because the entire design philosophy behind it is flawed. And I only need to inform you about one aspect of the game which should help you decide not to ever buy this game or any Ubisoft game for that matter.  This game has no end game, no enemy diversity, nothing else than mindlessly grinding bad gear to ultimately get to the good gear which serves no purpose. And the only real incentive there used to be for grinding gear was to become strong in PVP.  But the thing that I want to point out is the bracket system. The implementation of this system has split up the playerbase in brackets based on their gear score. So now everyone is equal and nobody is special. The problem with this is that the players who grind the best gear will also be the loneliest players. And this game already feels bland and empty. You also can't play with your casual friends if your gear score outlevels theirs. So the brackets enforce solo play.  Another problem is that solo players will always be at a disadvantage in the Dark Zone because in order to min-max, they have to cap themselves just underneath the max gear score for their current bracket, This gear score cap prevents players from creating truly powerful characters. This means that you'll always be an average Joe compared to the other people you meet in the Dark Zone, no matter how much time you waste on grinding for gear. It also creates a zone where solo players will almost never be able to beat grouped players, so strength in numbers is pretty much the only way to play it. It also does not help that the bracket system splits up the few that are still left playing, now that over 80% of the playerbase have already quit playing.  But the absolute worst consequence of bracket implementation is that you'll be equal to every player you meet. So when you hit level 30, you will play with and against others who have just turned 30. When you finally get some good gear, you play with and against others of the same gear score. When you finally get that perfect gear drop, you'll just end up being paired with others that have perfect gear drops.  There is just no incentive to ever grind for better gear. And the most enjoyable way to play this game is to stay below level 30 and min-max on the purple gear in the dark zone, even though not many people play in there either.  You have to wonder if you want to buy this game twice. Because this paid DLC-centered game will require you to. And I assure you that the game will never even be worth it's own price once, let alone twice.",

Recently I went through the same let down with Rainbow 6 Siege (another UBIsoft property) and it too looked nothing like the trailer with sub-par graphics and whole parts of the game from the trailer game play footage just flat out missing . Having finely seen the light I will most certainly not be buying the upcoming Ghost recon Wildlands. UBIsoft has lost all respect and credibility in my opinion, they straight up lie about their games. UBIsoft makes EA Games look like a halfway reputable company at this point.",

            "review_text": "Very solid carrot-on-a-stick loot mechanics akin to Diablo and Borderlands packaged in a cover shooter (like Gears of War) playing in the adeptly crafted remnants of New York - that's pretty much Division.   I've took my time getting to current max level 30 (it took me about 50 hours or so, but can be done in 20 as well) and don't have any regrets: while the missions and especially the enemies (there are about 18 or so enemy types in the whole game and only one I'd consider a proper 'Boss') tend to get slightly repetitive, the shooting mechanics, loot system, graphics design and sound design kept me going.  Running through the street canyons of New York at night while lighting scatters through an emerging, dense snow storm and a distant gun fight realistically echoes from the large buildings creates an immersive environment to get lost in: kudos to developer Massive. What helps a lot in these regards is that the game has almost no loading screens. Only during fast travel between safe houses in the PvE world, entering and leaving safe houses in the Dark Zone (large PvE+PvP environment with the hardest mobs and the occassional rogue agent) and for some reason using elevators (really, guys? GUYS?!) you'll see a loading screen - everything else is seemless.  The loot system works reasonably well. If you didn't get a cool drop from an enemy or so, the countless merchants in the game world have an ever rotating arsenal of good stuff to buy with hard earned money (mhhh, SOCOM M1A from a few days ago~). If the merchant can't provide, there's always crafting through blue prints you can either buy or earn through finishing missions. And in case of cases, enter the Dark Zone - risky but often times highly lucrative, it's currently the best way to get to high end loot, which you'll have to extract from it by calling in a helicopter to predefined areas. This will not only cause all nearby mobs to gather at the 'extraction point', but every agent in the Dark Zone will see it as well - latter will come and most likely help, while others just want to watch the world burn. I'm looking at you, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who shot me in the face while I tried to extract a pretty nice piece of equip, gaaah.  The loot progression comes to a sudden halt at some point of course - endgame has always been a grind in any game providing it in the last 15 years or so, and Division isn't any different. This can be frustrating, and I hope Massive addresses this issue in due time, but it won't stop me from recommending this game: it's very solid from the get-go and easily provides a proper return of (steep) investment if you like these kind of games.  Servers have been mostly stable, but occassionally hick up - during my about 87 hours of game play, I had to suffer from 2 or 3 disconnects and one downtime.   Bugs are existent in this game and there are currently two (in the widest sense) big ones I know of that can be a deal breaker: 1. Crafted Backpack-Bug that seems to kill peoples' ability to log in 2. Several exploits in the Dark Zone that allow people to drop under the map, teleport around, no need to reload etc.  Other than those - which need to be taken care of properly - I personally only stumbled over the following, minor things. - During a mission, I tried to take cover and clipped into the wall. Game removed me from the mission since it recognized I was out of bounds - UI bug. Values (like DPS, health, etc.) are all over the place depending on what kind of equipment you're hovering with your mouse cursor. Sometimes the values don't update at all when changing equipment until you return to the inventory overview, only to revert to their bugged state when you begin hovering equipment slots again. This should be taken care of, since it can be very irritating, especially for new players.  All in all a very promising game with a steep price tag. Much like Diablo 3 (the epitome of turning a game around), I can see 'The Division' staying in my gaming library for a long time.",

All for the purpose of getting highest gear.. that doesnt matter in the end because theres nothing else to do but wait for them to extend the game by makeing a gear level + 1.....

If they only had a new game + feature then at least you would be able to continue where you left off and balanced it like diablo 1-3 where you could continue to solo... that reminds me, as a solo player i can tell you... this game is NOT for solo players... if you die in a mission you get sent back til last checkpoint... and in DLC cases thats another 45 minutes ontop of the 45 minutes that was completely wasted as no enemys drop anything usefull exept killing the boss.. unlike level 1-29 where you could consider all drops...   I give this game 1 potato out of 5.. the 1 potato is the graphics... gameplay is missing, sound is missing (unless you turn on japanese voiceacting then the game becomes less spammy with the dialoge as it seems they didnt make all the dialogs on that language so theres sometimes even silence! :D) replayability doesnt exist as theres no point starting over (wich i learned the HARD way, not to mention theres a lack of naming ingame so your character\\CHARACTERS name will be the same, despite male\\female character)",

Very well put together with its storyline, beautiful graphics if your machine can handle it, and a great all around system for gameplay. Where it goes wrong it its inability to have a tailored style of gameplay for that lone wolf player. Is it possible to play this game by yourself?.. Yes of course, but you are going to have to drag yourself through almost every step of it. The pvp system is well implemented in the sense that you don’t have to use it at all if you reeeaaallyyy don’t want to. But the developers made it sound like all gameplay would run along smoothly and you would be okay if you wanted to avoid pvp all together. That is not the case being that you will eventually run into mission that are too high of lvl for you to do on your own, and let’s be honest… how long does it take you to do actual mission on your own? I’m not talking side missions, or encounters, or tracking down some more side mission crap you found on the street. I mean the real deal, the actual story line missions the ones that are supposed to matter and build on the rest of the game! It would be and entirely different story if their matchmaking system was a little better and/or their system for adding and gathering friends within game was better, i mean this is supposed to be an mmo right? Most of which i know of have a well founded freinds system. Don’t get me wrong this is a fantastic game and I have played through the majority of it already… as much as I could do by myself being done that way ( and believe me when I tell you I have more than enough sob stories I could tell about how crappy it is being by yourself in the DZ but we won’t go on and on about that) But if you are buying this game for yourself and your friends as well as mine either don’t have a pc or don’t want to buy into a game that needs the rest of your friends to buy into it as well for you to get the most fun out of it….

Coupled with the two DLC expansions out as of now, players have a wider variety of options available to them and the choice of how to gear up for the endgame isn't limited to running around in a PVP heavy environment only. The newest expansion, Survival, gives the game a mode reminiscent of rogue-likes, starting you out with nothing in the middle of a heavy blizzard.  Armed with just a sidearm, fighting both the cold weather as well as an infection, the player must work their way deeper into the city to get to an extraction point (going it alone or in a team of four) guarded by either other players in PVP, or powerful NPCs in the PVE mode",

IF you entered it again and you have a teammember with a happy triggerfinger or maybe he is easily scared then you will get hunted by everyone (2-3 shots on a nonagressive player and you are marked as shoot on sight with a big reward) and loose a lot of dz-ranks and money.  i should have never bought the game  (grammar and stuff -&gt; not my first language maybe pretend its not there)",

The gameplay is good and the cover system feels great in combat you have a lot of options, skills, grenades. The weakness would be the story but i don't think you care a lot in a game like this where player interaction is the most important. The game is repetitive, it feels like you do the same mission over and over again if it's not a main mission. The grinding can be a good or bad thing, depends on preferences but it feels great when you find better loot or improve your current one. Personally i would not recommend to play alone, even though people say it's balanced, i really think it makes the game feel empty, leveling up and looting is slower, this is really a squad game where you have fun with your friends, you can always use the matchmaking system though. The best part of the game for me it's the Dark Zone, a really good idea by Ubisoft. Where to start, it's lots of fun and action (if you play alone it might be frustrating, groups of people killing you just because they can). You choose if you are friendly or a rouge squad stealing everybody's hard earned loot until the whole Dark Zone teams up against you and gives you hell. As a new player it gives you a weird feeling, almost like you are scared. The character customization is pretty bad, you don't have many options to choose from. The map is pretty big and you have to walk until you unlock fast travel points. PvE can be a bit hard sometimes. PvP is very precise, one mistake and you are dead, need to be tactical. Conclusion: Get 2 or 3 friends and play this !",

If you like getting ganked by hackers, loot grinding, and paying for the other 2/3 of the game that was advertised before launch, buy it.

            "review_text": "Not worth the price, in my opinion. Not only that, but it crashes way too much for me to consider it enjoyable.   Gameplay is fun for a while, but rather bland. To be fair, it's tough to do things in a way that makes them seem fresh and new when everything in the shooter/MMO world has been done so many times.   On the bright side, it is pretty well polished. The environment is damn nice, it's immersive, the effects are very well done and the changing weather can make playing the same mission completely different a second or third time through. However, I have found myself out of interesting things to do. The encounter missions (what seem to be random NPC events where you can jump in and help the JTF [good guys] fend off some rioters or escaped convicts) get pretty stale sooner rather than later. You're either freeing hostages, stopping an arms deal, defending a patrol from getting lambasted by rioters, or the really lame scavenger hunt encounters where you have to slowly lug what looks like a suitcase full of supplies back to a container because the JTF are too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy to walk 50 feet and get it themselves. Missions are pretty cool for a while, but I never did a mission that stood out to me as an epic experience. It's just (1. Take cover and shoot at bad guys (2. Listen to radio instructions/chatter and advance to the next area (3. Rinse and repeat.  As of May 3rd, 2016 when writing this review, this is an overpriced CTD simulator. I really don't know why it's been crashing so much lately, because it did work very well a few months ago. I've been running it on a 5930K @4.4Ghz with 64GB of DDR4 @2800Mhz and a 980ti @1360Mhz. Disappointingly I only get around 45 FPS at 2K when the shooting starts. That is only when it runs, though. As of now, it loads up and crashes on start. I've done some troubleshooting, but it's kind of a sense of 'I paid $60 for this game, and run it on high end hardware; It should  just work ' that makes me want to just forget about it.  If you're into MMO's, and you want something that's modern day and well done graphically and mechanically, it's a good pick for around $25, no more than $30. And really, it may get better. The updates that roll out do seem to address issues, and they seem to have an intention of making it run right. The only issue I have with that is that it's not Early Access, it's gold release and you're charging a premium price for something that really doesn't work all that great and feels lacking in content. They did add some more missions in the last update, so don't discredit too much on that, but I really don't know what they added since when I went to check it out I crashed to the desktop as soon as the world loaded.  A negative part of those updates, however, is that they seem to be nerfing things to balance the game towards people who are just going to grind. You used to be able to get way better gear faster with loot and by combining lower grade components to make higher grade components needed to craft better gear. That just got seriously nerfed to the point that it's not really a viable option anymore. Don't get me wrong, the good stuff is there and it's obviously made so you don't max out too fast, but it feels like there are too few missions to necessitate the grinding required to get supreme weapons.   TL:DR Not worth $60 because: Graphics great but poorly optimized Lacking content Grinding required, repetition to be expected. Crashes to desktop. All the damn time.",

I payed little to no attention to the story as it is told via radio communication between you and the 'leader' which can easily be ignored if not paying attention to it. They expect you to grind missions all over again but on a harder difficulty to get 'better' loot and the best part is waiting for players to join your game to start it. And the PvP. Its a joke.

            "review_text": "I have spend 225 hours in the game so far.  And for the most part i did enjoy it greatly. But i slowly start to dislike more and more mechanics they introduce.  But let's first go over the good sides.  The Gunplay feels great. Even if you can't stand that enemies have such a large lifepool the guns respond in a way that makes it enjoyable to shoot.   The Coversystem feels great as well and i do enjoy to use it as much as possible.   I loved everything about this game until i hit level 30, what was after 20~ish hours in. After that i tryed the challenge mode the first time, with my purple and blue gear and of course we got utterly destroyed.  But we had something to work towards so overall that was still a really nice experience. The joy we felt for beating a challenging mission the first time without dying was just great.   And that was also the point where everything went down in a spiral of bad choices. At least that's how it felt to me. I had to bring up my DZ rank for some of the cool blueprints so we started doing this. Picked up some +exp gear and started farming. But we met a lot of Rouge agents so out farming routine was not as efficient as i expected it to be.  Don't get me wrong here i love the PvP in this game. But if i intend to FARM i wanna farm and not be forced into PvP.  This was the first problem i encountert that really annoyed me. As we kept farming it was more and more clear that the Darkzone is not that enjoyable as i thought it might be.   I do enjoy the PvP but to be forced into PvP while i want to farm is just a pain. It does not give me enjoyment at all. Once i reached the rank i was aiming for (50 at that time) i bought what i wanted to buy and started crafting. I did get pretty much everything i wanted and we enjoyed farming Challenges and other stuff preparing for the first Incursion as it should be released soonish.   Finally that day came and surprisingly i was able to play on patchday. So good job there. Just to realize how bad the first Incursion was. I did expect to have an actuall Mission where we need to work together as a team to clear different stages.  While it was hard i didn't really feel that much enjoyment out of it. The mechanics seemed meaningless because all we had to do was turtle for a couple of waves until a bomb spawned then kill the guy with the bomb and place it on the APC while deactivating the turrets.  Okay, sure. The second time we tryed we managed to finish the mission. Everyone was happy and since we did have pretty good highend Gear and were confident in our ability we thought we just try it on Challenging right after that.  Even our 'tank' with 120.000 life and capped armor got one shotted.  So, what's the point on being tanky? we droped all the life stuff and went full DPS which helped a great deal.  But in the end we just 'died' through the mission while running away. This was the least enjoyable thing i have ever done in The Division. Even in comparisson to the Darkzone where all we did was run a big circle route between bossmobs. For HOURS!  And those not feel good to get oneshotted from pretty much everything and i feel like this is a really 'bad' way to make a mission difficult.   Some days later i saw a new incursion on the north side of the map with a recommended GS of 220 for HARD! So, all the gear i farm now will be useless in a month?   If that is the case, is it even worth struggling through all of that not enjoyable content? I did not feel that way. And that kinda makes me sad because i really did enjoy the Division to a great deal. And i sure hope future Patches will fix that problem.  But to get oneshotted in a 'Tactical Shooter RPG' feels just wrong on every level. If i want to play a rougelike game i'd buy one.    So if you are looking for a game that will give you a geat experience for leveling up and starting out with challenging missions. Go for it. But if you are looking for a game with a somewhat decent Endgame and fair gamemechanics i'd stay a way and look how it turns out after a couple of patches.   And i did not even go into Glitches or Hackers since i hope this will be sorted out in time.   There are easy ways to fix a lot of these problems. Take away the oneshot kills and make it difficult through mechanics.   Implement Arenas. The Darkzone just feels like a sad excuse for an PvP Area.  Sure, Manhunt can be fun. Don't get me wrong. But wouldn't it be even more fun in an area where everyone wants to PvP?  I will hit the 'no' button for recommendation here not because i think the game is bad but because i think the game could be so much more!  Edit:   I checked the game out again, not as much but stll to get a feeling for all the new stuff. The game is a lot better.  There are still some problems i really dislike, but i feel like if you can grab it for a decent price, it will entertaine you quite a bit.  I am glad to see that they didn't give up on this game.  While i can recommend it now, you should keep in my mind that this game is only a Looter. All you do is to get loot and nothing else. There is now real tactic involved in battles since you can become so strong that you pretty much can Solo all the important stuff.   So if you enjoy a not to complexe but with decent content looter, this might be something for you.  It is pretty much a Action RPG in third person. :3 if that sounds like something you'd enjoy, go for it.",

It's just very boring to play. Here's why:  1. Bugs and crashes kill the fun completley 2. My character looks just like any other character, I've found my in game twin several times 3. Destiny has aliens with shields (ok, sure I'll bite), this game has regular human beings that just won't die after 100 head shots (kills it completley) 4. Guns are stale, they don't feel powerful enough, cool enough, sniper scopes are useless, handguns are totally useless, shotguns are useless in harder difficulties. You either use a rifle, sub machine gun, and a sniper . Those are your choices. I mean using a handgun against a bullet sponging AI feels very ineffective.  5. Everyone uses the same abilities, and of the already FEW abilities available, there are abilities that no one uses because they aren't useful at all. AGAIN, not only do players look identical to one another, they all use the same abilities, no diversity. 6. Predictable AI. I know exactly what the shotgun AI enemies will DO. EVERY SINGLE TIME. 7. Loot crates are totally unrewarding, power ups feel lame, very unnecesary. 8. PvE gets stale fast because of all of the above 9. PvP is only fun with a group of friends, and because I have zero friends that have this game, I don't do PvP (thanks!).  The only good thing you can say about this game is the game world, it's pretty. Gameplay however isn't where this game shines at all.  What this game needs: A REAL NEMESIS, to this day I don't even know who the bad guy really is. Let alone the current enemies have no real purpose for me to shoot at. It's like they copy and pasted one group, made another, gave them some generic purpose in game and presto! Hell, I'll take aliens and zombies over regular bullet sponging humans any day of the week. Also, make THE SHOOTING much more interesting - Give my character more uniqueness - seperate PvP and PvE to make the game more stable (probably the root of lots of bugs and crashes is the open game world)- and throw in matchmaking for PvP. Now that's a game I'd like to play.  I shoulda have bought Dark Souls 3. Anyways, I'll stick with Destiny for now.",

While I get that's what the game went for, the diablo/borderlands style of game, it does not work for PvP. ESPECIALLY if the game relies on it.  Ever wanted to PvP someone your level and take 10 mags of ammo to get them to half health, only for you to die in 2 shots? No?  Even being on the other side of that is dull as ♥♥♥♥.  Not to mention people pretty much gave up progressing so they just kill you for the ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, causing you to lose currency and items, while they lose nothing. Sure, they get put on the map, but they don't care since they don't plan on progressing. See what I'm getting at?  PvP punishes the aggressor, which is stupid since the area is supposed to have PvP. Not to mention this whole convoluted system hurts the victim more than it should. If someone doesn't care about dying, they'll just keep harrassing people that are trying to make progress. The system hurts people who actually want to take part in PvP or progress, but doesn't affect the people that abuse it. So if you want to start PvP, have fun being hunted. If you want to progress, don't go rogue (killing non-hostile players) else you'll get hunted. Want to progress by just doing PvE? Die because that person that seemed suspicious, was. But, you couldn't act first because you'd be punished.   On top of that, the game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥, but it's Ubisoft.  tl;dr just play a good game",

Glitches left and right mixed in with error codes all the time. I do not know what these guys were thinking when publishing a game this unpolished. They did not stop people at the begining from using glitches and now want to ban people for using them. However, there is basically no way to report people abusing them in game. Make an MMO and basically even forget the basics when making all was need was a look at WOW to get a few items in order, but that was even too hard. Mind the fixes that go into the game to fix the glitches only to make it worse. They should have taken another year to work out the cinks. Instead Massive and Ubisoft showed how much they cared for the Tom Clancy series. This is another case of a game studio thinking it can make a ♥♥♥♥ game and milk the money out of gamers like EA with Battlefront. They should have followed Destinity's style to keep this game going. This game is fun when ever thing goes right but something will happen within the first 30 minutes making you ask yourself why you ever bought this game. If your deciding on buying it do not you will be so far behind due to everyone else exploiting the glitches its not worth your time trying to gear up. Besides it is all about the gear score now and no skill. If you can get the best gear with the best stats you win hands down against anything. Just to give you an example that gear is all random in all the stats so have to grind everything out to get the best gear. Praying is the only way get it all. Even the lengendary weapons miss the mark by a mile. I see the game community slowly dieing over the next few months. Especially when it is found out that expanisions are only really game patches that should have been included. Looks like another $100 plus bucks to just get the full game.",

This game teaches the player how to divide groups of enemies by killing them, and slowly wiping each faction out.  I would highly recommend The Division, especially after the 1.4 update released, because it made it easier to divide the enemies up by changing the higher level enemies so they no longer take five magazines to kill.

The Survival DLC is easily the most fun I've had in a game for quite some time. Since its release I've played over 140 hours in total and almost all of it in Survival PVE mode. It is a challenging mode where you compete over scattered resources in the city, and trying not to get killed by progressivly harder enemies roaming the streets because you start out with just a sidearm, and at the same time battling the weather which also will kill you, and last but not least...You are infected and you have only 1 hour real time left to hit the streets looking for resources while the game costantly reminds you that the clock is ticking.   Some will think it sounds repetetive but it is not, at least not yet. Every time I go in something is different, such as your initial starting point, your fellow survivors and how good they are at getting to the best loot before I do. Weather condition so bad you can't really be sure you aren't running into 6 elite hostiles next time you go around a corner. If you are lucky you find a lone survivor like yourself and together you battle it out with the end game enemies, the Hunters, and leave the city with your sweet sweet loot. The payday for a successful run is phenomenal. High end gear and weapon you can keep or sell for credits. When I first bought this game I struggled to get 10k credits because you constanly have to upgrade your gear, but with just a few games of Survival 'im in the millions.

The gameplay is very enjoyable, as long as you understand that you are playing a MMO-esque RPG, not just an FPS/TPS. While FPS/TPS mechanics apply to the game, it has a lot of MMO features and mechanics on top of its shooter facade.   The DLC may not be required, but the Survival DLC is truly worth the money. If you decide to purchase the Season Pass, keep in mind it covers 1 more DLC before the year 2 pass rolls in.   As for player count, it peaks at 40,000 on weekends and averages 16,000 players every day, at least when I'm on and check.   The game is not nearly as much of a grind as some other grindy games, but it does exist during levelling as 'encounters' which are mini-missions which follow a set couple of objectives in different areas. Then, you have your side-missions which are more structured than an encounter, but usually have more straight-forward goals without major surprises. Finally, you have your big main missions, which have some lore to go with the mission story, unique and interesting locations, and usually culminate with a boss fight, such as Joe Ferro or Lae Berrett, or whatever her name is.   As for the world, a lot of it is streets and alleyways, but there are enough things going on to keep it from feeling like empty space. The world is peppered with a decent amount of the previously-mentioned encounters, so the world has stuff to do. The world also has various landmarks and unique locations, but are usually used for missions.   The Dark Zone will either be a turn-off or an attractor, depending on friends and what PVP you like. Essentially, you have a section of the map locked off in a red area, which is open for other players to be in. You fight stronger enemies there with good loot, but the loot must first be extracted to be usable, and can be dropped if you die. The factor other players have in this area is that they can kill you, obviously. Going in with friends is recommended, and is usually pretty fun. Solo players will come to hate the area though, due to 4-man gank squads mowing you down.   The alternative to Dark Zone is the 2nd DLC, Survival. It can be played in PVE, but other players can still finish you off to take your loot. Regardless, Survival uses unique mechanics seperate from the main game, like hunger/thirst, temperature, and an infection timer. The goal is to gear up while maintaining your bodily functions, find virals of the green poison, find some loot in the Dark Zone, and then extract. It feels like a fleshed-out minigame mode that generates serious tension during fights, as your life really matters in the mode. This mode will take some time dedication, anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, but can be played right after you reach the Terminal, so you could play as a level 4 with gear score 256 players and be on even footing.   Overall, The Division is worth a go in its current state, has constant and active support, with plans for more support for at minimum another year, a healthy playerbase, well-rounded activities, 2 flavors of PVP, and a generally fun Singleplayer/Co-op levelling experience. I'd recommend purchasing the DLC/Season Pass/Gold Edition only if they're on sale, but the base game is ok at $60.",

After the first hour, soloing the game just gets pretty boring. While I did experience some bugs and fps drops here and there, I actually had a good time, but since none of my friends can run the game, it got boring. While I did not go into the DarkZone (I read in multiple places that if you aren't in a team you're more than likely going to get screwed by people who are), I had plenty of fun in the PvE zones. All in all, this is a great game with friends (or solo if you don't mind being alone).  8.5/10",

Though what is a shame is DLC since the game is quite missing content it would be better if they din't add dlc for a game that is lacking like destiny.  TL:DR Great game! but lacks in content for missions because DLC. They should really make updates as cool as the survival update for FREE since it feels like the game should of had that in the begginning. Wished it had more in the dark sectors to since there are 2 zones to extract and over all is a 1/5 of map but feels pretty empty.  to sum up the game is to rebuild your base of operations and to figure out what happened in the city AND to find a cure. Rebuilding your base gives you more abilitys to use but by the tiem you get the really powerful abilitys that is centered around coop you beat the game since there isn't too much end content other than rerolling and doing the darksector to get higher equipment like destiny in a way but it's incrediablly dull doing this since the DLC are hard because it's meant to be for end game people but still is paid dlc.

            "review_text": "Was very skeptical of the game when it launched and avoided it. I had been hearing some good things about it lately so decided to grab it on the holiday sale - I am so glad I did, the game is fantastic! I am not sure how the game played earlier this year, but my experience the past few days is super positive and I've been having a blast.   Things I like:  - The cliche story. It's done well and there is a lot of atmosphere and little details crafted into the world. - The gun play. This is definitely a cover shooter and the running and gunning feels great and satisfying. - The controls. I have played with XB1 controller and keyboard and mouse. They both feel and play great. - The graphics. Textures look good and the lighting and particle effects are beautiful. - The audio. Ambient sound and music are well done. Gun sounds are pleasing to the ear. - The loot. Love the loot. Guns, mods, armor, clothing... lots of opportunity for customization here.  - The Darkzone. Upon reaching level 10 you gain access to the Darkzone. The city is instanced for you and/or your friends where you won't run into other players unless you head to a hub or a safe house. The Darkzone, however, is openworld and considered a pvp area. This is the most lawless and contaminated area of the city, where any thing goes. I don't recommend running around here solo - the mobs are large and tough, and of course, the threat of other players. The nice thing is the game really encourages socialization and team work when you enter. Voice chat is enabled by default and if you have a mic you can just start talking to people near you and they can hear you without doing anything extra. This makes it really easy to team up with others and communicate effectively. Upon entering the DZ for my first time I immediately encountered 2 other players and helped them finish off a mob, we chatted afterwards and they invited me to their group. The loot in the DZ is awesome, the catch is you can only cary so much of it (I could only cary 6 pieces of loot, I am not sure if you can increase this). Once you get your limit, you can either fight your way out of the DZ, or find an extraction point. Extraction points are areas where you can call in a chopper to extract your hard earned loot (it goes into your stash). Once you signal the chopper, it takes time to show up, during this time NPC mobs will attack. Once the chopper is there, you can load up your loot, and again you will have to defend the chopper for a time limit before it leaves. The system is pretty cool and keeps you on your toes. I loved my time in the Darkzone and can't wait to go back!  Things that could be improved:  - Character creation. There really isn't a lot of ways to customize your character when you create him/her. This didn't bother me too much though, as once you start playing there are tons of ways to customize with gear.  Things I didn't like:  - I haven't ran into any yet.  Summary (TLDR):  A fantastic 3rd person shooter/action game with great graphics, a fun and interesting world, a brutally fun and anxiety inducing multiplayer zone (The Darkzone), and awesome loot!  The most fun I've had in a multiplayer shooter in a few years. ",

While I never personally had any specific gripes with The Division prior to 1.4/1.5, I can however see what people were upset about previously, but at this point I feel the majority of those issues have been addressed and resolved as the dev team really took to heart player feedback and they committed to tailoring the Division to suit it's player base.

This game can't keep up, the devs can't stop, they can't go back and fix all that needs to be fixed, instead they have to commit to their DLC schedule, which will kill this community.

Update1 Game is still complete garbage. It's been months and the added 'content' is laughable. The same glitches are there ( not being able to interact to turn in quests is a big one I've had problems with from day 1). The gameplay is still undewhelming, the city devoid of anything worthwile. They could've made this game mission based with the option to co-op like a resident evil game and it literally wouldn't effect the content at all, that's how lifeless and useless the map is. I'll post again after a few xpacs because I was dumb enough to pay for a season pass before launch. Won't be making that mistake again with Ubi.  Update 2 1.4 patch came out, logged into my game and there's literally no difference. Enemies are a bit easier to kill now and you get items for levelling past 30. Tried matchmaking for a mission and literally waited over 45 minutes for it to find another player. Either overlevel the content or trick your friends into buying this. Seriously Blands 2 is a loot driven shooter and has a million times more content than this. Just buy that instead.",

            "review_text": "Now with nearing 20 hours on the game I can say that the reveiws i read saying the game was bad were mostly wrong.   1. The game (Now with the survival DLC) is like Destiny, a game that i have hundreds of hours played on console, it has and had a good campaign with the side missions flushing it out more, they could have added more actuall missions as to help develop Fae Lou and some of the other divison agents, espcially the first 'wave' besides security footage and people talking about them.   2. The one problem I have most are the controlls, when moving to cover and stuff, I find it very difficult to get out of cover and back into it without dying. Atleast for me this is the case. I would like to see the utilization of a few different controll layouts so that you can choose or, as they already have, map them yourself!  3. A good A.I. System and leveling, The way that you are alowed to progress is very nice and easy, To matchmake you have to be two levels below the set A.I. level, or you and a party of friends can attempt to get to the start of the mission by walking there through the dangerus streets of the higher level areas trying to get the start. This makes the game really fun and have some elements that you just dont find in other games that are similar to this game.  4. The items in the game are... well somewhat simple, there is the basic level of character=this type of gear, but the gear also has 'major' and 'minor' pre-added mods to the armour, which has very many varients, from gloves to backpacks and then the clothes you have on under the leveled gear you have a good amount of change you can do. But the character creation has your general preset people and not to much after that. Im not saying that the characters in the game are lacking but there are games that have systems that would blow this out of the water.   Well this is all I have to talk about for this game thanks for reading!",

My two friends played the game nonstop while I took breaks every now and then. They ended up being lvl 30 while I haven't even hit lvl 20 and we couldnt go into the dark zone together, which is all they wanted to do. So I grinded to lvl 30 with little help from my friends but the 1.1 patch had already came out, and they came out with a new dark zone balancing system which grouped people based on gear set. Well I didnt have any gear set but i could apparently join them in the DZ regardless. But i can't survive when my gear set isnt up to par with what my friends gear sets are. So I'll just collect loot and then just lose it all because i don't have a strong enough build.  Closing Thoughts:  My recommendation to anyone who wants to buy this game... DON'T! Because if you do you better have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of free time on your hands. This game is a hell hole when you solo queue and a annoying game of keep-up when you play it with friends. If you are one of those people who doesnt enjoy constant grinding just to be able to survive with your friends then don't even bother wasting your money like I did.  -1/10 a complete waste of my time     ",

There has never been a game that I've ever played, including alphas, with as many bugs as I've discovered in this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥♥. It's as if they literally didn't play test this game at all. Zero quality assurance team to debug the games mechanics. Everything is capable of bugging and is. It's not a simple matter of a few tweaks to perfect this game, no. Literally requires an entire overhaul due to the sheer magnitude of ♥♥♥♥♥ this bag of cuck has to offer.  - Getting stuck on random architecture. i.e. jump off a truck onto the top of a fence, nope. Game will not let you hop off. Get stuck on a box, nope. Time to fast travel back to base, your character is stumped and can't find his way off a 2 foot box.  - Unmovable objects. Drop down off a small step and a bad guy charges you? Well, you are now ♥♥♥♥ed. You can not move them, they trap you against the wall literally pinning you. Can't roll away, can't melee them off, cant climb back up, can't grenade yourself to stagger them. Nope, this NPC has decided to make you his life partner and you are now in a commited, and desperately clingly relationship. Because they are so close you can't even hit them, all damage registers as if you shot them in the arm or foot.  - Pick up a key item that needs transporting with a shield? Nope, ♥♥♥♥ you again. The map is now glitched, you must, a.) have everyone kill themselves and reset the instance, or b.) if you have already killed all mobs in the area and have no grenades left, must now completely abandon the instance because it will never fix itself. The item will respawn, but it will not proc. any of the mechanics to progress further, you are done.  - Random breaks in skills. You will be fighting and due to whatever combination of ♥♥♥♥ covered sticks that fell together by happen stance, will no longer be able to properly use your abilities and must now go promptly ♥♥♥♥ youself. Either you can no longer cast abilities all together on one, or both of your hotskills. OR, there will be random broken mechanics like, you will pull out a heal and it cancels mid cast, you will try to target something, click left mouse, and it will instead stow the skill item back. You will shoot the dart, but it will hover there for 20 seconds showing a healing pad and doing nothing, only to have it proc the heal after you run away. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, there is no minor cd on deployables, so as you spam your key to cast a heal, or station, or any deployable, it will IMMEDIATELY destroy it the 2nd keypress before it even deploys the item. Even if you caught yourself and stopped pressing as the deployable is being thrown down, it will finish the animation, then immediately destroy itself.  - Clairvoyant NPC's. I kno this is a problem in most AI, but seriously, how difficult is it to add line of sight to the game? NPC's will ♥♥♥♥ing nail you between cracks as you pass them with pin point precision, ok fine. I can deal with the fact I'm fighting lvl 10 grand master Navy SEALS. But shooting everyone through literally every single wall or view obstructing artictecture when line of sight is broken is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, have them miss a bit for ♥♥♥♥ sake, even with infinite pulse they shouldnt be hitting me in the head 10/10 times with their ♥♥♥♥ing cinderblock bullets.  - Grenades. Holy ♥♥♥♥ on a stick. Don't even try to bounce them ever. The indicators are lying, split-tongue ♥♥♥♥♥s of satan. You will have a perfectly lined up grenade, take your hand off the mouse, click the button, with nothing hitting you or even suppressing you, and it will literally throw it at your feet. The projected arch and bounce are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It will throw it where ever the ♥♥♥♥ it wants to. You may be thinking, but there must be some rng in the grenade, no one can throw an object exactly where they want, right? No, ♥♥♥♥ you, then remove the projection. That's some indecent ♥♥♥♥, or present a warning. Hi, I am a division agent, I throw like Michael J. Fox.  - Cover. Trying to maneuver left and right around objects for cover is aids. Don't even attempt it. There is like a 4 second delay where the agent attempts to tackle his Borderline Personality Disorder, and console himself before making the decision to take cover and not ♥♥♥♥ing die.  - The list goes on, Mmm, The AIDs is strong in this one I see.  This game has completely been abandoned by their developers. They have decided to pawn this off to whatever rag tag group of DEVRY university drop-outs and said ♥♥♥♥ it. See how many sand paper ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can throw at the audience before they stop coming.

            "review_text": "  This game has absolutely nothing to do with 'Tom Clancy's' style of games and even as a stand-alone cover-based third-person looter-shooter co-op open world game it isn't very good... But it isn't particularly bad either. The story, Bullet sponge opponents and few technical issues clearly drag this down. The Division is visually a good looking game and it does sounds great. And it might be fun when played with a group of friends of equal level. I'd give it 'yellow' recommendation but Steam only has 'green' and 'red' and this is a Ubisoft title with Uplay on it so I'm leaning towards the 'red' i.e. I'm not recommending this.  There are few design decisions which I'd like to talk about like how the cover-to-cover actions work and you can still take bullets while you're in the cover to name some. I think it's a bug since there clearly was few occasions when I was against a wall and the AI opponent was able to shoot me through the solid wall. However going through all these issues would take a long time to go through and I'm not sure it's worth it. So I'm just going to say that there are things that some people probably will dislike greatly. Opponents in this game have clear issues with their AI as well.  Also the looting aspect in the Division is practically every Ubisoft open world loot-game ever and that ♥♥♥♥ is so old that I cannot find the fun from it any longer. And I hate it when I die and have to run 5-10 minutes back to action and then almost immediately die again and repeat this few times. It's being made worse that you'll see a loading screen everytime you die and the game reverts to earlier save point. You'll also lose whatever mission progress you had after last checkpoint which is pretty ok actually since death will have some weight to it.  Playing The Division with random people is pure hell because the game will adjust difficulty based on group stats and if there are high level(s) then all low levels essentially drag the team down. Also I met during this weekend quite a bit of Division players who were just total jerks.  The story isn't particularly well written as it starts from nowhere, goes nowhere and (apparently also) ends nowhere. I don't get why does every character in this game have an attitude problem towards everything. They're in such an emergency situation doing ridiculous actions and having such expressions and thoughts that I don't find the characters relatable at all.  I'd like to put also emphasis on how they aren't 'Tom Clancy'-type characters whom would lean towards how actual military &amp; government official -background personel would behave and act. I can say that with fair certainty as a guy who actually reads Clancy's books. In any case there has been a steady decline towards your regular 'action heroes'-type thing in 'Tom Clancy's' branded games. I'd like to Red Storm just return to doing what they did in 90s.  Visually the Division is great. It looks great and has stable framerate and is a pretty smooth game. However I'd strongly recommend that people disable BS effects like chromatic aberration that ruin the screen image quality. Also the forced screenshaking is quite annoying.  Music and sound in this game is quite good and suits the theme of the game well. However as part of the issues with the characters the voice acting is just ridiculous at times.  Physics have some issues in this game but nothing too crazy.  Controls work great in the Division and there isn't really anything to complain about. They even offer dual bindable sockets for keyboard and mouse players which is just great. Massive Entertainment knows their stuff.  This is a game that is sold at Steam but it absolutely requires installing of Ubisoft's Uplay. It takes a long time to download and install and it essentially used so that Steam is merely used to chainload and then launch Uplay title. That's just cancer. This game also doesn't really have a real offline single-player since you need to (according to my understanding) be constantly connected to the servers. If you stop playing you'll be disconnected from the servers after a moment and thrown into main menu which I thought was annoying. The Division also has microtransaction as part of the game.  I still have the absolutely grinch Ubisoft scripted showcase in my mind which was just about the most unrealistic showcase of team-based multiplayer voice chat conversation I've heard.  The Division also has subtitles for many languages including Finnish language which I found to be a great addon even thought it has few translation issues and the in-game menu's are not available in Finnish.  I see here absolutely loads of wasted potential in the Division. It could have been great but they've dropped the ball with it. I played this few hours and reached level 15 as a part of the free weekend promotion they had so I've marked it as such.  I'm trying to like the Division really really hard but I just don't like it. And because of multiple issues I experience with it it I cannot recommend it to people.",

Servers were down day one on launch and they didn't even have the balls to compensate for the down time, nor to even let people know what was going. They grab your money and disappear.  Also, you can;t even go prone or duck in this game. This is an fps and you can't even do basic movement. Since this game was made for consoles and is just ported to PC there is the ability to have an aim assist. There is litterally an aim bot built into this game. Any form of skilled PVP is imposibble. You can't even enter all the buildings surrounding you. It's literally just a corridor shooter, not an open world in any form.  Character customization is a joke. You have such limited options I have no idea why they even added it to the game. And the characters you can chose from are just horrific looking. The artists for this game need to commit suicide.

My laptop is not the best and I will try to keep this in mind.  However these recent bug fixes must have upped the minimum requirements to the point that my laptop cannot play the game like it could in the open beta. With massive framerate drops and an increase in visible latency with the local server causing teleporting bad guys, one shot kills and even the inablility to see anything in a certain direction.   But here is something else; the game, while it starts off boring and not verry interesting, gets better the more you do (because you'll learn more lore about the game and get given even more questions). Gameplay is pretty goo given that it makes use of cover to cover and Tom Clancy's favorite type of shooter (Third Person), and it's also given faults of not doing precision movements when you need it. While I realise that Ubisoft is releasing DLC to expand the underground of manhattan, there is no real reason to eplore there yet.   To recap: Must have very new or high end computer you will feel overwhelmed alot in this game Bug fixes have made this game poorly optimised again DLC expanding main stories ahould not exist  P.S. There are alot of either hackers or high tier players killing players in the dark zone, making it hard for not as well equipped players to get much good gear, and the general ammount of mobs in the DZ have had a massive increase post beta",

You can go to the dark zone, and farm for the same gear, it was a bit faster but that was nerfed into the ground already.   The best part is even with the best gear, it's going to take you forever to kill things. You've heard of the bulletsponge, and it's insane here. If your idea of a good time is head shotting trash mobs with the best sniper rifle in the game 100 times, this is for you! That's not an exageration, every mob worth killing takes an insane amount of time.   It just doesn't feel like there is anything to really do.

Loving it so far - very atmospheric, seemless city scape I have only seen in games such as GTAV &amp; Witcher 3. The pure PvE areas of the map whether solo or co-op are smooth &amp; mainly mirror RL locations. I love the quantity of buildings you can actually enter and which also really give you the feeling that they have recently been occupied. Loads of rooftop access makes it feel like another zone / layer to the city as there is that much to explore.  On first log in the day after release, within 5 minutes I had found a queue with RL players actually all stood there chatting, patiently waiting their turn to try and log onto the one laptop - hilarious, and appealed to my Britishness. This incident revealed a few things... That 'gamers' would infact queue and wait their turn showed a more mature environment, and the chatting that was going onproved that. It also seemed that this was in actual fact an error with the size of the player interaction area of the laptop, which was fixed the patch the subsequent day! This IMO shows that the guys are on the ball and is hopefully a good sign of things to come.   Cons: Lack of side mission &amp; encounter mission types leads to slight repetativness by lvl 20 (but collectables, story missions and visiting the DZ easily breaks that feeling up) Character indevidualisation is limited  Overall: Very Happy with my purchase and at 80+ hours played so far I still have 4 PvE levels until the 30th lvl max, and am only lvl 15 in the DZ levels so still plenty of play hours left. Thats not even considering the time that will need to be spent searching for all the collectables and the inevitable gear hunting!",

As far as end game goes you've got two avenues to explore, the darkzone, and dailies, this is where the game gets reduced to a choice between infuriation or bordem. The DarkZone isn't infuriating because of the PVP typically, though it certainly has its moments, and the challenging/incursion dailies are certainly not boring, the problem is there is no middle ground. To step up from the boring grindy content, you have to go straight to the infurriating, die repeatedly, group memebers quit, other players steal your loot, suffer XP loss content.  The decisions Massive/Ubi have made in dealing with exploiters and hackers, as well as the direction they've taken to 'balance' out the end game experience (mostly about getting the best gear) consistently makes the gear grind longer and more difficult for the casual player, while not making any attempt to pull the exploiters/hackers back into line with their vision, reducing the phoenix credits being drop by bosses, doubling and trippling the required components to impove the quality of crafting resources, increasing the amount of top tier crafting resources to craft gear essential to being able to complete the newest content.  Ultimately in the end, the game became too much work to get the gear so that you can go do content that will infuriate you... I really want to enjoy this game, I really like it, but I have to be honest, the last time I had fun in this game was almost a month ago.

I do not recommend this game if you have high expectations for the PVP aspect of the game. You can find way better options for competitive PVP. The darkzone dynamic is completely flawed because it is easier to farm NPCs for gear than killing other players. I really was disapointed in this so I do not recommend soley on my opinion of the dark zone. They need to change this in order to move in the right direction.   They reuse character models way too much and the world feels like it could have been more dense with objectives and enemies. I think they put way too many resources toward creating the environment. I really wanted to like this game too.   ",

Purchased it last week while on sale and I'll say I have not been disappointed. The main story is fun and interesting. The recreation of New York is rich in detail and atmospheric. The plot is a little troupey but still enjoyable.   I've played both with a buddy and solo. I will say that with a friend is better. The game is a loot grind game, and if you don't like that sort of thing you generally won't find yourself staying to long. However, Survival mode is excellent and almost worthy of a stand alone and is probably one of the best 'Battle Royal' games I've ever played.   Season Pass is worth it if you can catch it on sale.   I have yet to try the DZ PVP and apparently that still has some balance issues.   One Metric I use for games is the 'Dollar an hour' metric. If I play a game for as many hours as I paid in dollars then I feel like I've gotten a pretty good bargin. I'm already close with this game and I have no doubt that my hours will keep rising.",

            "review_text": "Heya!  Well lets start with the good sides of the whole thing, shall we?   First of all the game looks AWESOME! The visuals are amazingly done and give this apocalyptic feel. This is especialy true for the Dark zone. They got the whole apocalyptic setting better than anything I have seen so far. Sounds are also nicely implemented. And I mean everything from weapon sounds to ambient sounds of distant battles! As for the story side they could have done more with it but, hey, I did not buy this cause of story tellin.  Thats about it.  From there it goes only downhill! Content that comes with the game is REALY short. You could reach end game in not more than 2 days of casual gameplay. That would not be such a bad thing if only PvP thing worked as it´s supposed to. But I will come back to that matter later on. As I already said the game has very nice visuals which took, IMHO, 80% of invested development time. Once you finnish off the main story 3/4 of this beautiful world stands empty and useless since you dont have any reason at all to ever go back there. They do try to force you to revisit some locations to collect some resources sometimes but other than that there is nothing. It´s almost as if they just gave up on the whole game after they did the bloody map!   And missions? Aside from main story missions (15 or so...) there are some side quests and encounters. Both are basicaly the same 4 missions repeating all over the map. Those include repairing some radio towers, freeing hostages, killing some mini bosses for example. And not to forget my favorite: Virus research encounters! OH those are... fun! You basicaly run through a building turning on some box looking things... hope you like them cause you will be doing them over and over again since they are required to research all your abilities. Thanks for that Ubisoft!  Also main story missions are buged and sometimes, after this loooooooong loading screen you will end up infont of a mission which can´t be started. I´ve heard roumors that there is this special technique to start the missions when they are buged. But I never managed to do it other than disbanding the crew (after finaly finding a english speaking crew with headsets! Rare commodity...) and starting over. Plus why would I even have to know that??? FIX IT UBI!  But what happenes in that 1/4 of this so called open world? Thats where the Dark zone is! I gotta say I was realy excited by the promises this game gave regarding the gameplay in the Dark zone. They failed EPICALY! As you will find out once you get in there match making in the Dark zone is not related to your gear rank, or your dark zone level. The thing that determines with whom you will be playing is your PvE level. And since everyone reaches 30... you get the picture. The thing is that you as a fresh rank 30 will be hunted and killed by players against you will have absolutely no defences. They will have better gear and work in teams and shoot you just for being there. Do not get me wrong I´m all for PvP but this has nothing to do with skill or fairplay if a player has absolutely no chance of defending himself. Then there are hacks that exploit non existant security measures of this game. Players with 16k RPM, no recoil, autoaim, teleport hack tools are roaming the streets and can basicaly kill you from a mile away before you even see them. If it was just for the the fact that you died and respawned it would not matter so much but you will loose your loot, xp and some other things every time you die. And Ubisoft is NOT doing anything about it. They talk about it but so far they ahve not moved a finger to fix anything.   What they did do is add one free 'incursion' so far. That is a good thing, right? Wrong! First of that is NOT a raid like mission. It is basicaly one big room with some cover filled with lots of already existing enemies. It is hard I have to admit but that is not what I consider a raid. What it does offer is access to some new high end gear sets. Those give out some pretty awesome bonuses, which brings us to another problem. Like the rest of the game the incursion is glitched. There is a posibility of going out of the map and doing it from the safe distance. Ofc that players found that out nearly instantly and spamed that mission (it´s a bloody mission, it´s not a raid!!!) on chalenging difficulty and got some pretty amazing gear. And that brings us back to the flood of gear score 215+ players in the Dark zone who will be more than happy to shoot your puny character down. Once again Ubisoft is not doing anything about it since the glitch is still available for abuse.   Finaly, we come (back) to the topic of a player base this game has. Such a gathering I have rarely seen in any game. Aside from aforementioned hack and glitch abusers there are various other... individuals... that will make your life beautiful! For instance more than half of player base does not know the purpose of a push-to-talk settings for example. The other day a guy was eating chips right into the ear of entire team. Ofc you can mute them but on higher difficulties being able to communicate is a MUST. That being said I know this is not Ubis fault. But, please, could you not make dedicated servers just for russians and french at least??? XD There are decent guys there with whom I had fun doing runs but they are rare and far inbetween. Oh, and good luck trying to find a random group for Incursion on chalenging difficulty!   So, after a lot of time invested in this game I have to say that this game is a half finished product spit out too early for waaaaaaay to much money! Stear clear of it until it improves in major ways.   And thats not likely to happen cause they already got their milions out of it. Remember: Ubisoft = Watchdogs, Farcry 4 (mod for FC3), Far cry primal (mod for a mod for FC3)...   There...  I just hope you didn´t buy it already!  EDIT: after all this time it still sucks in the same way. And yet some play it still! -.-",

            "review_text": "  For reference I played during the Free Weekend, hence 'recieving the product for free'  This game sucks. Plain and simple, it offers the player nothing more than what feels like radiant quests. Now, there are a few things I like about it and I'm sure it's much more enjoyable with friends, but the game in general is mediocre in terms of gameplay, story, voice acting (You'd think the post-apocalypse would feature a bit more cussing that the occasional 'damn' and the rare 'b!tch,' no?), and gunplay.  Gameplay, from the first 6 or so levels of play, was just running around New York completing quests that 'help the people, because they really need it!' as the whiny, pre-pubescent-sounding radio operator would have you know. It's kind of like if Dying Light were in third person, didn't have melee weapons, and didn't have free-running.   Story is thrown in there because it was necessary. Black friday, contagious disease planted in New York, special operatives have fancy watches that tell them it's time to become military trained fighters. Because keeping the peace automatically involves using a military force to kill all of the thousands of people that suddenly became super hostile and formed hierarchies in raider groups overnight. Where'd those guys even get AK-47's in New York, anyway?  Voice acting doesn't REALLY need it's own paragraph, but... It's bad. Lines are all very forced, the radio guy sounds like... I don't even know how to describe him, he's just some kid that they gave transmission access that overhypes every action you take, like a box of morphine just saved a million lives or something. Yeah, sure, we got painkillers and the raiders aren't going to become opioid addicts now, that's really great, but I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing superman, sitt he hell down dude. He's not the only bad actor, everyone's pretty bad, very overdramatic lines delivered with no umph.   Gunplay is actually both good and very very bad. The weapon custimization is fun, that is, you have borderlands-esque randomized weapons but every attachment can be removed and added to another weapon. Once you pick up a holo sight, you can use that on every rifle you own as long as you only attach it to one gun at a time. Each holosight you pick up however has different bonuses, so you're going to find one that's better every once in a while. So that's good. What's bad is that enemies are either blind, deaf, autistic, strategically impaired monkies on the 'normal' difficulty, or brutal, superhuman, x-ray vision, physics-defying supersoldiers on the high difficulty. There is no in-between. Either you can stand in the middle of the road and take out 5 of them with ease, or you sit behind cover while they lob perfectly-thrown grenades at you and shoot at your head through cover. Either you pick them off with a headshot or two, or you load several clips into their head to make them flinch. The balance is awful and you end up relying on lucky AI decisions to survive the harder fights on your own.   3/10, would suggest playing on a Windows 10 Emulator in a few decades, but definitely not spending money on it.",

The only regret I have is buying the 'season pass' because I was well burnt out before they had released anything - and the stuff they were putting out for the highest level missions were really tedious at best. I definitely got my $$ worth out of it though (even though at least 1/3rd of my 'played' time was tab'd out while doing work stuff.)",

Unrefinded gameplay mechanics such as windows that don't break and windows that don't even show bullet holes when shot, the cover mechanic can get you killed if it forces you to stay ever when you move forward away from the cover",

So yesterday I bought the game at the same time as my friend, clearly liked it because of the great Open Beta. We ran through a lot of missions and side missions, had a lot of exploring and killing patrols. The work on the game is great because I've never seen a map with so much detail in it. The missions aren't generic at all and dont lack any kind of variety in it (Height, Underground , Different kind of bosses/enemies). I'm only at 50% of the campaign and actually can't wait to finish the game and go grind the DarkZone, which I really liked in the Open Beta.  There are some weak spots in the game I encountered too: I don't find the game really hard, I've been playing the missions on Hard mode so far and only died a couple times. You can get yourself in spots where you can easily survive. It isn't hard at all to get the good stuff: Around level 5 I had around 2k of health and a specialized M4, not the best stuff alright but I dominated most of the sidemissions easily after that.  I'm really looking forward to the darkzone gameplay and for the DLCs.   Recommended",

I have also completed ALL the side missions and encounters in addition to collecting all 293 (I believe) collectables. In terms of end game, there isn't really much to do rather than running around the dark zone following the same path over and over again, killing the same named bosses to barely get any good loot. Of course, this assumes you've completed all side missions and the encounters, otherwise they're actually fun to do. Also, if you're the type that can't stand shooting human enemies multiple times to kill them, then you should stay away from this game. It is a 'bullet spongy' game. HOWEVER, the enemies do get much easier to kill as you level up, to the point that most of them can easily be killed in less than a 30 bullet mag with the correct stats, some of them can be killed in single headshots with most guns (such enemies are the red ones that patrol the streets). In my opinion, I think the hours I put into this game for the price I payed was okay, especially that I did enjoy all of the playtime, but would of probably enjoyed it more if I got the game on sale. In terms of performance, good luck... My EVGA GeForce GTX 770 SC can barely scartch 60FPS on medium &amp; low settings. Unless you're some super human who can withstand 30FPS, make sure you have a more than capable PC.  I would probably give it a 7/10 just because of the boring endgame, especially that your level in the dark zone really doesn't matter since this game is a numbers game meaning that a person who spent a lot of hours grinding would have much better stats than you, despite being the same level. This means that if you're an average player, forget engaging in PVP as you'll immediately die and loose loot.  ",

Originally when I was playing the beta and then playing this on release I was quite entertained with it. Now twenty something hours later I still have exactly the same appreciation for it. It really is a good game and that's saying something coming from Ubisoft.   The PVE experience has an engaging storyline, and really solid game mechanics. Don't buy it expecting some kind of combat simulator, this is a RPG shooter first and foremost. That means if you are a lower level than your opponents you are going to be emptying clip after clip into them a la Borderlands style. Even when you are sufficently powerful enough to engage certain enemies, some of them will simply be of a higher standard and some will be bosses. That means extended gunfights where your tactics and use of your abilities will make the difference.   For a new release this game is very polished, performance is great, and no major bugs (although you may run into some minor ones that get patched out frequently.) I run the game on a 2560x1080 monitor with all settings maxed out on my GTX 970 and it really couldn't be any smoother for me, maxing out the Vsync framerates. The graphics and the environment are complicated and detailed and sure look pretty especially with changing times of the day and shifting weather effects.   I've played a fair bit of Destiny and I found it a bit meh, but as there aren't really many team rpg shooter games like that I stuck with it. Now I can confidentally say that there is no reason for me to ever fire up Xbone to play Destiny again. This game far exceeds it in nearly all categories.   Solo play is quite feasible in this game even though it is touted as a team based online game in the same way that the Borderlands series is always still soloable. There's plenty to do in the PVE areas, nothing that REALLY requires a team to accomplish so long as you are sufficiently levelled and are using the right skills and gear. Most of my time in game has been spent solo either in the PVE areas or in the PVP Dark Zones. That being said, grouping up brings you to another level of entertainment. If you don't know anyone that plays it, the matchmaking feature in game couldn't be simpler. Whether you are in PVE or in the Dark Zone its a simple matter of pressing a key in the map or at a matchmaking terminal and suddenly you have your group ready to go. You can also do one on one invites if you see someone in a safe house or in the dark zone that perhaps you don't want to turn your back on without them being in your group.   Pros: - Polished Game - Very solid and unique gameplay - Pretty environments - Character and loot progression - Crafting - Engaging Tom Clancy storyline - Soloable - Fantastic team fun - PVP zone is unique and tense whilst still being very rewarding - Devs look to the future and will be expanding the game further and further as time goes on  Cons - Fairly generic ambient civilians - Limited enemy types (around 4 major enemy factions each with about 4 different types of soldier plus bosses) - some minor bugs   This is probably the first game where I've dismissed the negative criticism it gets on the forums and reviews and I'm glad I did. The trolls are out in force trying (and overall failing) to bring the game down. My advice is to watch a Twitch stream and make up your own mind. That being said, it's the kind of game that is actually a lot more fun to play than to watch so keep that in mind. If you like the combat mechanics and you have a soft spot for looting games like Borderlands or Diablo then you need this game. You won't be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "Alright so, as of posting this I'm level 28, still got a bunch of PVE stuff to do and way more dark zone to explore, but I see a lot of negative reviews and I think I know what the issue is for real.  This game, as of writing this review, is getting kind of a bad rap. Mostly because hackers were previously running rampant in the dark zone (which is a pvp area), and as it does in any online pvp, it was souring player experience. Recently they've begun to take measures against skilless losers, so that's good.  I think there are two main issues here:  1. People grab The Division expecting it to be a total PVP focused game, and as some of you may know, any developer who releases a game with even a small amount of promises for PVP usually attracts some of the less desirable players, i.e. trolls, hackers, nolifers and so on.  2. The game really doesn't have a ton of content, and while that can be pretty daunting for a 60 dollar purchase, I'm reminded of other early MMOs, countless persistant online worlds who all suffered from the exact same problem. Some of these games sink, some of them swim. For The Division, only time will tell.  To go further into issue one and two at the same time, The Division, in my own opinion and experience, is not a PVP focused game. That may seem strange, as it is absolutely a 3rd person shooter, but I feel like Division was meant to tell a constant story. This is also evidenced by the fact that the upcoming DLC is a rogue-like survival expansion, and I admit, I'm sort of excited to see this come to the game.  I don't think a shooter, or even a Tom Clancy game, absolutely has to be all about PVP. PVP is fun, mind you, but it's nice to have other things to do. That of which do exist in The Division, such as:     Missions (all of which tell a story)    Base upgrading (also part of the story, and for me, a fun thing to participate in)    Crafting (I like my crafting)    Multiple types of item collection/rewards (Being sort of compulsive, I'm a bit drawn to picking up random things, and finding everything)    Gear grinding (This is standard in any persistant online world and/or MMO and I don't see how anyone could feel  that ♥♥♥♥♥♥  about it)    Weapon customization (Love customizing weapons)    The PVP dark zone (An extremely dangerous area with high risk and sometimes good reward)    Matchmaking/group finding (I've found many random groups and had quite a bit fun in that area)    Incursions (A max level sort of thing built for 4 players, like a hardmode dungeon with gear rewards)   And that's pretty much the game right now. Notice that PVP is absolutely not the main focus here, even though it's totally welcome, don't get me wrong. Is it fun? Yes, it totally is. Does it get boring at times? For what it is, and the current state of the game, yeah, it does. I don't think this is a title you're currently meant to play 8 hours straight without pause, though, and I think that's part of the negativity as well. Aside from that, it's perfectly fine in moderated stints, at least if you're like me and have a ton of other things going on outside of game worlds.  Would I recommend it? Despite a lot of the playerbase jumping ship at the first sign of hackers in the DZ, I would, yeah. Even if endgame grinding and risky as hell PVP isn't your thing, there's still about 40 hours of content to have fun with until then, and for me, 40 hours of content alone is getting what you paid for. I know games that take less time to play to an artificial sort of completion and have even less content and fun to be had.  Take all that how you will though, it's just what I think.",

The combat is fun and the AI are fun to fight, they'll flank you and charge your last known position which is more than you can say for some games.

The story overall, the cutscenes/videos you find/audio clips all add to the overall story.  PvP is tense/fun in the DZ  A LOT to explore, and more to come.  Looks great, hardly a downgrade from E3  AI go to average level of players in your group   Cons:   -Missions, especially the encounters, do become repetitive but I have yet to play a whole lot of the main storyline, i've stuck to encounters and side missions this far. -If your characters face matters to you a lot there isn't much customization, but seeing as how this is an over the shoulder 3rd person shooter where you only see your face in certain stances in cover, doesn't matter to me.

            "review_text": "(Updated) This is the first time I've ever felt the urge to write a review and I'll start off by saying THIS GAME ISN'T FOR EVERYONE but if you give it a chance and view it with an open mind for the type of game it is, it can be an enjoyable experience. I've read through a large number of reviews, both positive and negative, and I was overwhelmed by the amount of negativity and misinformation people had to say about this game... I'll attempt to break down my experiences with the game so far and give you my take on some negatives people are trying to claim for this game.  1. Launch Day Woes and Server Stability: Although I'm sure people had different experiences, I only experienced a server crash once at the NA launch time, which lasted roughly an hour before Ubi had everything up and running again and I've had zero issues with server stability since. During the crash I kept updated via the vast amount of people streaming the game on Twitch and social media and the majority seemed to be able to reconnect around the same time frame when servers went back up. This didn't sway my initial impression of the game as it seems to be an unfortunate reality that these things happen with almost every major mmo title at launch. If anything, I was actually impressed with how quickly Ubisoft was able to regain server stability and make the game playable for everyone.   2. Game Play and Bullet Sponge: This seems to be a popular bit of criticism and although it's subjective in nature, I feel like the negative comments are from people who simply don't/won't take the time to understand the mechanics this game has set in place. First and foremost this game has many different mechanisms from different genre's meshing together. It's important to understand the core mechanics behind the intended game play. This game is an rpg first and shooter second. They are two very different styles of play. Normal enemies die very quickly if you're loot is up to par with the level content. As for elites taking several clips to kill - well I can't imagine a boss fight, (or an encounter that is meant to be challenging), being enjoyable when an elite mob/boss takes a few extra shots to take down then you pack your ♥♥♥♥ and call it a day. I'll get more in-depth on this in topic 3 but to sum it all up the game plays like an rpg with some minor mmo elements. Your core damage comes from basic attacks (aka shooting) while utilizing positioning, cover, weapon loadout and skills/abilities you have spec'd into with your character. Some claim it to be boring, I find it enjoyable. To each their own.  3. Group Encounters and Dungeons/Main Missions: The way the group encounters are now is a welcome change in my mind. Coming from an mmo background where group content didn't feel all that difficult, I've run several hard mode missions using the matchmaking system in this game and found the encounters depend on much more coordination from your squad using skill separation, target focus and movement/cover swapping during combat. Anyone charging in, running and gunning, expecting to down multiple elites dies very quickly and puts the squad in a tougher spot as you loose vital dps and aggro spread. I've witnessed multiple people try this approach putting themselves in a position where the group can't revive them without dieing themselves. The key is to coordinate priority targets first, ranging from mobs that rush you with melee weapons/shotgun, throw nades, snipe you from afar (they do a ton of damage).. etc and move as a group to regain better cover. There is some fair criticism to be said towards boss mechanics as they do seem to be very repetitive. I'm level 15 now (cap is 30) and haven't really experienced any different mechanics for boss fights. The missions and encounters themselves are different but the boss fight mechanics are relatively the same. Take cover, shoot boss, move to different cover to regain position advantage, rinse/repeat. Certain bosses hold canisters which you can shoot at to explode and do burst damage but all-in-all it doesn't feel all that different from shooting the boss themselves.  4. Loot and Character Progression/Grinding: This is one aspect the game does very well. As many others have said, I have to agree that the game gives off a Diabloesque vibe, leaving you wanting to continually get stronger and progress your character through the game. Obtaining stronger and cool looking loot while increasing your characters stats is definitely a focus in this game which makes it the bread and butter so far for me. I very much enjoy loot based progression and this game does that well enough to keep me wanting more. Combined with the third person shooting, weapon modding and an interesting atmosphere to explore, progression is both addicting and fun, making it feel like less of a grind and more of just playing the game.   So if you manged to come this far, you can probably tell by now my initial impressions of the game are good. I still have some concerns regarding endgame and longevity. I also hope to see more interesting mechanics for boss fights either in the next 15 levels or when challenge mode begins and I start the endgame climb. However, I must say this game is one of the few in years where I feel compelled to play consistently and very much look forward to progressing through the rest of the game. If you're still unsure of whether or not you want to invest, I would suggest doing some research, understand just what type of game this is and see if it appeals to you. If the answer is yes then I would highly recommend it!!  -------------Quick Update---------------  After progressing through more content (level 21 now) I've found boss fights still to feel repetitive from mission to mission. This hasn't pushed me away from the game, as I did some of my own research and understand fights become much more diverse near level cap, but I felt it was a fair bit of criticism to update. One major gripe I have as well is the recycled mini-objectives for wing specific points. I like how they've spread objectives across the map in each zone, leaving you the option to explore and complete them, but one thing that really erked me was how many of the objectives were simply copied and rendered within a different setting of the zone you're in. This is something I feel they could have made more diverse. I don't mind repetition every once and a while but seeing the same thing over and over from zone to zone gets to be a bit much. Thankfully the content in mini-missions and main-missions still feel to have variety, making them feel interesting and giving me incentive to complete them. I'm still looking forward to reaching endgame and doing challenge mode missions as others have described them as 'brutally hard and really enjoyable.' I noticed almost a 50% split in votes and I would love to hear some comments/opinions from others about the game and/or my take so far. See you at level 30!!",

If you are expecting an MMO-esque RPG with Destiny/Diablo/Borderlands looting mechanics, a huge open world map that looks beautiful, and extremely tense and exhilerating PVP, you won't be dissappointed.  The AI is good on the Hard mode in missions, tons to explore, lots of lore to be found on how the virus spread, the voice acting is OK, sometimes cheesy.  If you're easily offended by Politically Correct statements in games and things which obviously pander to the small SJW audience, there will be two instances that'll make you shake your head, nothing too crazy though.  Uplay also isn't an issue, I only use it to send friend requests, that's all you need it for. The servers have been consistent for me and haven't crashed once in my 26 hours (so far). Perhaps for those having issues, it is on their end and not Ubisoft.  The line in the laptop opening safe house thing to activate your 'agent' is also being addressed by Massive Entertainment, and either way you can just find a new server, takes about two minutes TOPS.  Overall it's a great game and doesn't deserve the hate it's been receiving in the reviews section IMO. If you want a fun TPSMMORPG type game, give this a go. With friends it's even better.

The graphics alone honestly make the game worth getting, they are absolutely incredible. And now after they fixed a lot of the bugs and issues with the game in the 1.4 and 1.5 patch, the game is much more fun, the enemies are challenging but not impossible and there are plenty of ways to gain new gear, not only just in the Dark Zone. The new Survival mode is especially fun if you have the DLC, frankly it's good enough to be a game in itself. It's also a lot of fun to play with friends, especially in the Dark Zone. If you like cover based third-person shooters and you like MMORPG type games, this is the game for you.

I couldn't wait to unlock the different skills. I have 25 hrs on here but if you include my X1 time I'm closer to 90+. So here's the thing. Most of the negative reviews on here of people that played it the first day when MOST of the issues cropped up.   Pro's: Dark Zone is awesome. Honestly if you're solo in the DZ you are basically dealing with a massive pucker factor when trying to extract items. Are those two guys rolling up on me cool? Are they gonna go rogue on me as soon as the helo arrives?   The ability to change difficulty on the main missions is great. I spent the first day just doing all the side missions in the low level areas. So I ended up being 4-5 lvls above the mission min requirement. You can change the difficulty to Hard which bumps the enemies to your level AND makes them purple (which gives them an armor boost). Now the side missions and the location missions are the level of the area you are in so if you are a few lvls above the area you're in (Ex: lvl 10 in a lvl 5-7) you'll shred enemies.  Skill changing. I LOVE THIS OPTION. You can change your skills on the fly mattering on the situation. I normally run Heal/Scan....but when facing bosses I swap my scan out with either turret or the cover boost (I love this one in the DZ). The cool part is the game does NOT pause....it kinda slows time down for you to quickly change skills but if enemies are charging you...you can die while in the menu. If doing this while in the DZ you'll get flanked REAL quick. So do it fast.  ",

I was really excited too, but it didnt meet my expectations. I was hoping for a game to replace Destiny, but i was mistaken. The division does some things really well, and some things not so well. Lets start out with the bad and get that out of the way.  The things I didn't like about the DIvision: There is way to much pve, and not enough pvp. There are two ranking systems in the game, one for the pve area, and one for the pvp area. In order to get the best gear you need to rank up in both of the areas. I was happy grinding out levels against pve enemies for a good while, but once I hit rank 30 (maximum pve rank) I was done. I wanted to move on to the pvp and rank up there to get more gear. But the thing is, you can't really level up just by pvping. The darkzone is an area where you rank up from killing pve enemies as well, except the enemies are stronger, and you lose part of your rank if you die. Really disheartening when I reach a new rank, die, then derank. Also, other players can kill you, and take your money and gear you have. thats extremely disheartening also. It makes it almost impossible to do anything in the darkzone without a team running with you.   Now on to the good stuff: The Division had a decent story to it, nothing specail. It wasn't as good as The Last of Us, or as bad as the Black Ops 3 campaign, but somewhere in between. the voice acting and character development was good, I knew exactly who the important people were and what they do. That's something I don't usually see. I liked that. The cover to cover movement felt amazing, I was always in control. The guns all felt unique, and I really had to think about what kind of weapons I wanted to roll with.  I would say that the game is worth the 60 dollars, but only if you enjoy killing the same enemies over and over. If you like playing against other players, this is not the game for you.",

            "review_text": "The best part of The Division might actually be its UI. It's been a while since I've seen an user interface this slick - The diegetic panels hanging in thin air sell the feeling of modern urban warfare more convincingly than a dozen of imaginary gadgets and beam weapons ever could.  Or maybe the best part is the post-catastrophic New York itself. A sizable chunk of a city ravaged by a weaponized virus has been meticulously created, and it looks and feels absolutely spot on. There are small details and nice touches everywhere, and exploring the alleys, stores and subways is constantly rewarded with little snippets of information that reveal the blight of the individuals caught up in increasingly dire circumstances.  The game doesn't shy away from its heavy subject matter. I'd say the worldview of The Division is surprisingly dour for a high-profile AAA blockbuster. The somber tone is disrupted only by the side mission voiceovers which try to add a dash of humor to the game, ending up sticking out like a sore thumb.  The environment tells a much better story than the main plotline, which is mostly concerned about shutting down various factions operating in the city and providing the players with more fodder to chew through. The shoot &amp; loot gameplay of The Division manages to stay smooth and engaging although the enemy variation is minimal: Shooting guns just feels right, which is weird considering you'll usually have to unload a whole clip for a single bad guy to give up the ghost.  Moment-to-moment tactics never rise into a big role when playing alone, but jumping into a small group brings up the nuances of engagements better, with actual flanking moves and planning required, especially on the higher difficulty levels.  Praise must also be heaped upon the Snowdrop Engine, which is one of the most impressive pieces of graphical technology for the current generation. It might not be the fanciest engine, but the vistas it manages to consistently pull off are certainly impressive. Sound is not quite as great, and there's a lot of repetition in the audio that is somewhat jarring.  Anyhow, I quite enjoyed my time with The Division, playing both alone and in a group. The game nails the tempo of individual firefights, but more importantly it understands the value of quiet moments as well. Jogging along the deserted streets, just exploring and taking in the views remains my favorite thing in the game.  The Division is a solid cover-based loot shooter. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table; It just polishes an existing formula to a pleasing sheen. I think it's easily better than Borderlands, for example. Maybe that's because I found the subject matter way more compelling. It's a Tom Clancy game with the usual Tom Clancy gun/military/technology worship toned down. This post-apocalyptic world proved to be more interesting than anything Fallout 4 had to offer.",

Let me say that this game can be a lot of fun with friends. If you're playing alone, you're going to have a tough time unless you team up with random people in the match making.   Think of this game like Diablo in the sense of playing with friends and the way the weapons and gear work. Color coded for rarity, stats, etc. That is the best way to describe the game.   This is NOT an MMO! Playing the normal side of the game, you will never see another player except when you enter a safe house (or if you are in a group with friends). The only time you might ever fight a human player is in the Dark Zone (DZ). That is the only time you will see another human player. Think of the DZ as the PVP area.  I highly recommend the game based upon the playing factor.  BUT!  I cannot recommend the game based upon the bugs. Yes the Day One f*ck up was stupid. Too many people trying to play the moment the game released crashed the server. But that isn't what I'm talking about.   Some players bought the game and couldn't even download the game. Others bought the game, downloaded it, but couldn't play it as they only had black screens.   Or you might be lucky like me. I can play the game... most of the time. Sometimes I'll get an entire day of 'Account Temporarily Unavailable'.  Then there are other bugs that happen with other games. Falling through the ground or getting stuck into something and can't get out forcing you to fast travel. Sometimes you can't complete a mission and are forced to restart the entire thing over multiple times until the game accepts that you have completed it.   I would give this game another couple patches before plopping down the full price for it.",

Pros:  Great Shooting mechanics Good Cover system Enemy Variety Good teamplay  Great abilities  Pretty Good sounds; indoor echos, reverb off objects, etc. Fun story; that although Clancy himself didn't write you could see him doing so if he were still around. an overall great experience  Cons:  Servers broken on Day 1 (but hey its Ubisoft) Dark zone rogue system for PvP not perfect IMO, but functional I suppose A bit unstable FPS wise. But i always stay above 45. (i7 4970k, 16gb RAM, GTX 760 4gb)  This game received some undue hatred because of a rocky launch, quite typical of Ubisoft.  BUT!! Like many Ubisoft games, once released adn the bugs ironed out they become extremely well made and enjoyable games. Some of my favorites: Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, and Far Cry 2,3,4 all are Ubisoft.  Overall this game provides a great experience for Coop and even solo play, a real diamond in the rough. With a ton more content to be released this year alone this game will be a well polished game that will last for 2 years or more.   Worth my money.",

The game went downhill when it realesed, maybe because of the bugs and glitches or even hackers in the game, now that the game has gone through some DLC's and has been updated there are almost no hackers what so ever and many of the bugs and glitches that were dicovered when the game was realesed are now gone. If people gave the game one more chance I am sure that they will like it a lot better. For people that are looking for a good multiplayer adventure, action game, this is the one. Give it a try, But 1st always remember to get to level 30 1st and do all of the things you can when you become level 30, Once you are level 30 and go to the Dark Zone and do the Incursions and all of that good stuff, then you can judge the game.",

The hackers/cheaters in the Dark zone are pathetic. You can completly avoide the Dark zone but you won't get epic drops like high ends or gear sets as frequent. If you buy the season pass I recomend buying it on the last day of the month because every month you get 2 personal supply drops. These supply drops give you a 100% chance of one gear set and 2 high ends. I really like these supply drops as it does help with getting to max gear score of 255. Personaly I really enjoy the division and underground also. I recommend this game but don't go into the dark zone unless your rank 30 or have 3 friends that have rank 30 or +180 gear score or you will have no chance of defeting bosses or cheaters.",

Absolute Garbage of a game, starting out it is fun due to all the freeroam activities running around the city gathering stuff and enjoying the atmosphere. As the game gets closer towards end game, the story turns into a stupid rushed ending that makes absolutely no sense at all.   This game in theory was going to be a huge hit, by bringing together a shooting game with RPG mechanics but what it turned out was a complete pile of steaming piping hot crap because it implements the worst aspects of both genres. Players suffer from shooter mechanics of easily getting 1 shotted by the AI, while the constant spawn and zerg rushing of bulletspongeAI towards the player makes it near impossible to not bog down.   Having a dedicated machinegunner to suppress the AI doesnt work either because a) he will get 1 shotted by uber laser marksmen or b) get overwhelmed by the enemy because all the weapons in game is poorly balanced and machineguns seems to be shooting out spitballs, as of now there are only cookie cutter builds revolving around certain weapons (SMGs, Marksmen/snipers) because everything else simply doesnt work.   At endgame its just mindless grinding of extremely stale instances (camp in the pit for 15 waves APC mission) or near ridiculously amounts of sniper, mortar, machinegunner, shotgun zerg rushes (clear sky) nonsense missions. All the while having RNG work against you as it drops tons and tons of absolutely useless gear with useless stats. Instances at times bug out and after matchmaking for a pub game just to realize the gates dont open or the AI dont spawn.   The implementation of gear score in recent patches seemed like a great idea until you realize that pubs will constantly boot people with insufficient gearscore but at the same time gear score being nowhere near a good gauge of player skill. It is also buggy and at times the gear scores of my friends constantly fluctuate without them changing equipment.   All the best gear seems to be locked in the dark zone where forced PVP is encouraged, have not been in there too often, but the times I did stumble in to try to get some good blueprints ended up being lagfest or death due to cheaters/exploiters.   Absolutely stay away from this game unless you have too much money to burn, in that case go roll those notes into a cigar and smoke them or better still donate it to charity. Go get a proper RPG game or shooter game and have fun instead of mucking about with this piece of monstrosity that dares call itself a game.",

            "review_text": " EDIT #3 - Fixed Grammar and Typing Errors     The Game:  Tom Clancy's The Division (just 'the Division' for the remainder of this review) is a great little online RPG game by Ubisoft! I'm amazed too that Ubisoft was able to pull of making an entirely new franchise and not have it completely suck like many other Ubisoft games (Watch_Dogs for example).   Gameplay:  The Division plays great, in my opinion anyways, and I am playing it on the PC (Windows 64-bit). The controls (keyboard and mouse in my case) feel natural and 'correct'. The game does not feel 'choppy' or 'blocky' like most multi-platform TPS (Third Person Shooters). Most of the time the camera just feels all wrong when using the mouse, but not the Division so kudos to Ubisoft for making the game feel great on PC when using PC controls.  In addition to 'feeling' correct while playing on PC, the game actually plays correctly too. The only bugs I've ever really had were just latency bugs (I'd kill two enemies but the game wouldn't 'kill' them until suddenly all at once - this has only happened 4-5 times total and the 'lag' lasts no longer than 2 seconds tops).   Game Performance (PC):  The Division runs great on PC (in my case, right now an Alienware 18' laptop with SLI). I'm not running it at maximum settings on this laptop (though it does run at max settings on my desktop); either way however The Division looks great - regardless of the computer I'm on. The game doesn't seem to suffer from lagging and other performance issues like Console Games on PC (aka ♥♥♥♥ ports like GTA IV and even GTA V).    The Play 'Feel':  The way this game feels is pretty much covered in the above paragraph; however I may as mention it in specific detail here. The Division feels like an online RPG Third-Person-Shooter and on PC it feels like it was made for PC, again stuff I've already stated. As far as the way runs/feels/etc. though I will give it a seperate score for this. For being a decent game or even port (if it is) it doesn't feel bad so it gets  4 out of 5  stars for the 'Feel'.    Manhatten (PvE):  All of your non-PvP quests for leveling your standard level and whatnot takes place outside the 'Dark Zone' in the middle of the game's map. In this area you simply do PvE quests against NPCs, you don't end up fighting any actual players (PvP) until you are in the Dark Zone - which has its own leveling system versus the PvE leveling system (you level differently and they have no influence on each other).   The Dark Zone (PVP):  The Dark Zone is The Division's PvP Zone. Here player Agents can go 'rogue' and kill you; they usually do this while you are waiting for your extraction for 90 seconds after launching your flare. Not all agents have to go Rogue however; if you choose not to you instead, will be killing these rogue agents. My knowledge on The Division's Dark Zone isn't the most complete; however I am aware that once you shoot off your flare, there is an intense wait for gear/player extraction. Other players can see your flare shoot off and will come for you for the loot you're extracting; so be careful and if you can - go to the Dark Zone with friends (up to 4 people per group).    Overall:  Tom Clancy's The Division is a great Online (MMOish) Third-Person Tactical Shooter. In the non-Dark Zone areas it's a PvE game and once in the Dark Zone it's PvE with PvP thrown in as well. I must caution to watch out for higher 'Dark Zone' level players while you're a low level. They tend to kill you just because they can - half the time they don't even bother taking loot; or they'll steal all your loot but let you live - so be aware of that too. Otherwise I highly recommend The Division to anyone who is into the Tom Clancy series of games, or is into games with a realistic story, or just into online games (or third-person shooters). I should add that the maximum amount of players per 'Dark Zone' instance, I believe, is 24 players (including you and your teammates if you're with any). Either way, while that 90 seconds may be intense - it sure is fun waiting with your buddies to see just how much ♥♥♥♥ is going to go down!   Other Thoughts:  Other than what I've previously mentioned; I don't have much else to add to this review. I hope it was sufficient enough to help anyone out with making the decision of weather to get The Division or not. I'd say yes it's worth it - but me and all my buddies think it is. For those of you who aren't my buddies or me - just make up your own mind because nobody is better at giving you an opinion than yourself! ;)    Overall Score:  5/5 - An Excellent Ubisoft Title, and one of the rare few deserving of a full 5 stars. I was surprised that this game is as good as it is; I just wish the XBONE didn't get that lame 30-day exclusive stuff first... Oh well we PC players still get it.",

Exploration is lack luster and the missions are just hold x defend y and eliminate z. Am I supposed to be captivated by the story?

I have plenty of friends playing it also. One has fallen through the world a few times(he is running an older system close to min requirements). But the rest have had no issues. The game is not pefect (There are some BUGs, and issues that need to be worked out and I am sure they will be) but I would say the game itself is near perfect. Some of the bugs are like ablities not going off or shield getting stuck or cant shoot with shield out until you drop and reuse it, the cover system can be clunky at times, but again these will get corrected I am sure. It's and RPG First then 3rd person Shooter, then MMO (when in DarkZone), all in a realistic envoronment but not realistic killing because its RPG/MMO &gt;3rd person SHOOTER!!!! NOT other way around!

If you like Diablo, PoE, WOW, Rift and such games but also like shooters (3rd persons shooters/cover based) Then I honestly I can not see why someone would not love this game as much as me and all my friends do. The DarkZone is like no other. It's got the anxiety and rush of Rust, DayZ and such games, never know if/who/when someone will try to kill you, its amazing.  If people claim the game is to easy, then they did not play long enough. Because let me tell you once you are 25 or so it got harder but still managable but easy enough to die. But when you hit 30 and try to do Missions on Hard again not impossible once you get gear very doable but the Challenge Modes, GOOD LORD. Wrecked me and my friends. THEY ARE INSANE and I love the fact that they are. The DarkZone 05 and 06 are much harder mobs too, can die very easily and lose your gear to other agents in the area. Even if you get mad loots to drop you have to be able to get it extracted. For most part have not seen nearly as many rogs as I did in beta but I am thinking that will change as people get more geared. People are some what skiddish right now, and uncertain plus the lose of exp and funds is huge if you are high level rog/man hunts and you get killed :) its all so thrilling.  Again game is not perfect it has some issues/bugs but I am sure they will get resolved, but the game is AMAZING! I would say its well worth all the money I have spent. My kids, friends and I are all truly enjoying ourselves and I forsee we will be for a long time to come. ",

The ending to the story was kind of meh, but you can tell they plan to continue it through dlc. With it being Ubisoft that did not really surprise me at all. The Borderlands-esque looting system was really interesting. I hope there are more weapons added as there are probably only around 25-30. The Dark Zone is not quite what i thought it would be, in that I personally thought that it should be more densly populated with human players(This could just be server dependent). I just reached end-game 23 hours in so there is a bunch of stuff to do and incentive to play more, once you complete the main questline. All in all Ubisoft is turning their ♥♥♥♥ around this year with the release of Far Cry:Primal(super fun game) and this game as well...

Same goes for invisible walls, they somehow spawn randomly and wont let you through until the zone is done loading, which is freaking stupid because guess what, invisible enemies can spawn behind the invisible wall and can and will obliterate you if you try to guess from where youre getting shot at.

            "review_text": "I love games with depth. RPGs, MMOs, Open world games, I mean don't get me started on those. But what I don't like, is when a game is marketed as one or more of the aforementioned genres. Yet fails in one or more of them. Is this an RPG? Well yes, in the same sense pokemon is, but even pokemon has more depth to it.  In 'The Division'; you gain experience and level up, get skill points which you can assign to a skill. So far so good. Textbook RPG right there. But the thing that bothers me is that it's so short on everything. You get three 'skill trees', which you can switch between, and adapt accordingly to the situation at hand, so you're not stuck with a choice. But it's shallow, In the end everyone can have the exact same skills, really, the exact same character. There so individualism, my character felt like exactly every other character. Did not feel personal at all. Not even the appearance feature has a wide variety as I saw myself pretty much everywhere. But I digress, I believe this was not their main focus, and I've seen that cosmetic items do exist.   So is it an MMO game? Yes, in the same sense that the Dark Souls-series is an MMO game. What I mean by that is, outside of the Safehouses and the Darkzone, you'll be alone, for all time, travelling from location to location. You'll spot NPCs form time to time, but that's about it. I compare it to Dark Souls-series in the way that even in Dark Souls you have some form of communication or at least contact with the other worlds, i.e. other players and it is NOT marketed as an MMO last time I checked. But in The Division there exist no such thing outside of the Safehouses and the Darkzone. So, MMO? Doesn't really feel like it, but I guess the term is so loose that it can be applied to this game. The true way to play this game, is to play it with others. Because New York is a really lonely place.   And of course, the open world aspect. What can I say? I don't think it's more open world than the rebooted Tombraider-series is. Don't get me wrong, I like Tombraider. The areas are big in that game, but linear, not really 'open'. Why, oh why, did most of the focus for the game go to visuals and world design? Sure, it looks stunning at times, except for those white/grey/black colours that you see everywhere. Exploration is useless. You might find some survival guide pages, some loot, maybe some other things I don't know. With only just short of 2h playtime, I don't really know if exploration contributes to anything later on, as in secret missions, items, NPCs, shops, etc. But what I did and regret now, was to explore. Found some enemies, got some loot, pretty standard. Went into building and apartments, found some canned food and energy bars. Sweet. Pretty much a win, right? Spending 5-10 min for an energy bar? Priceless, papa bless.   Now for some positive feedback on this title.   It has great combat, I fell in love with the combat so much. I noticed small details I didn't think about before. Mind you, I'm not a big fan of shooters, but I do love me some TPS. Enemies react to you pretty much instantly after engaging combat. There is barely ANY stealth.  But I noticed that you can sneak around a few covers/corners and if they didn't see you do this, they'll still think you are somewhere around the previous location. Which is a pretty fun mechanic and you can clear areas without taking a single hit; that is, if you get rid of the melee enemies first, then do some recon action.  This by far is the only positive thing I have to say about this game.   Crafting, pretty mundane from what I understood. Didn't do any of it, will thus not give my full opinion about it. Pretty standard crafting for any game really.  My biggest disappointment with this title. Was the lack of customization when it came to your characters appearence and skills. Think of it like XCOM: enemy unkown vanilla, where you had two 'trees' per class for your soldiers. While this game is honestly just one class, with different specializations which you can change whenever, so whatever.   People compare it to Diablo? Really? Path of exile too? Really? Mass effect? What?  Mass effect might've lacked in class depth but it did not lack in story, content, and most of all exploration.  Diablo and Path of exile, ARPGs to begin with. Gameplay not the same at all. So in what way are they similair? They're not in my opinion. Even Diablo and PoE rewards exploration. And they have a much greater depth in both story and customization.   Thoughts:  They shouldn't have had put The Division centered in New York. They should've done it in a ficitional city where laws could've been different. Model it after New York, whatever, but give the game something else than just plain combat, boring design, and simplified character depth. Futuristic elements, a 'what-if' historical scenario just something different. Innovative. Do I wanna see New York? No, I really don't. Do I want real-life conbat? Yes, but then again this gmae is TPs...  My score for this game is a LOW 2/10. Have never seen a cash dumbster and time waster like this for many years, and hope it'll be the last to come. I will officially NEVER purchase any other game developed by or published by Ubisoft.",

RPG elements blend well with gunplay in ways that are compelling and feel a bit tighter than other mash-ups, such as Borderlands.  Two buddies and I went and did one of the main missions for the game, Joe switched to heals and played with his sniper rifle. He provided spot heals and high damage on important targets.   Matt provided buffs with Pulse and Smart Cover.  And I used my turret and sticky grenade along with a LMG to get lots of attention and keep enemies pinned down.   Honestly, it felt great. I was able to Supress enemies (who took cover and received a 'Supressed' status) while my teammates moved to engage. We worked together and it felt like we were playing the demoes from E3, it was that flawless.  When they're not around, the game still feels great. Dropping in on friends and helping them with their missions is quick and easy.     The Division is a unique experience that is sure to upset some.   It isn't Gears of War. It isn't Destiny. It isn't Borderlands. It isn't Splinter Cell.   Gamers always cry for innovation, but when they get it this is the result.

I recommend playing with friends, or if you are very trusting of people, playing with strangers. You get better loot, but it is much harder (enemies and other players). You can solo run in the Darkzone but being a higher level (gained in PVE) will make you last longer, as you have better weapons, you get better drops, and you actually have skills/perks/talents to use.  I very much recommend this game. It had bad reviews at the start (shaky launch, server problems), but most problems people had before dont seem to be an issue now. Some minor graphical bugs, nothing game-breaking. If you are focused, you can level up every 30 mins to an hour, and its very rewarding.   If you like RPG's and you like shooters, you will like this game.",

Ubisoft does not report if they are banned at all, there is nothing you can do except writing a mail to 'general' section and get no reply.  2. Crafting materials that dont drop. You can spend up to 6 hours with no progress on your itemization/craft materials.  3. Weird game development that just jumps from one state to another in a blink of an eye, you cannot predict anything.

If you think it is the next Ghost Recon, you are going to have a bad time and need to wait for wildlands.   The best part of this game: The Multiplayer easy drop in/drop out method. Your buddy has to go mid mission? You can grab backup by finding someone else who needs in. Or you can complete it with the three remaining. Must multiplayer games is like pulling teeth to find good servers and good coop matches. I will not give any examples but all you out there who like coop games know what I mean.   Worse part of this game IMO: Lack of a post game run through. Yes they have challenging missions once you get to level 30 and can replay all the others on hard or challenge however free roam becomes pretty limited once you are in the higher levels. Back in the early levels bad guys will level up to about 4-5 under your level which is better then running into mobs of level 2s when you are 30 but still makes the entire beginning stage of the map pretty limited once you are in a higher level bracket for free roaming (which is my favorite part). Some sort of diabloish 'Nightmare' mode would be badass. There is always the DZ but the DZ is pretty frustrating sometimes and hard to solo where free roam gives a laid back loot gathering environment.",

The Good:      Its a beautiful game with a sorta big open world and copious amounts of details.     Gameplay is solid.     Above average story line (can't believe this falls in the 'good' category these days but its just that common)    Extremely fun with friends   The Bad:     Repetitive missions, not much variety (or like at all)    Hackers. So many mother****ing hackers.    Some bugs here and there, honestly the beta was more stable for me.    NO COMPETITIVE VS PVP MODE. I mean WHY? Jesus H. Christ, its a shooting game, give us something to shoot at. DZ is filled with hackers and even if it wasnt, I just feel like a total ♥♥♥♥ sometimes killing lone players and then get mad when i get ganged up on by a dozen other players. For all that is good and holy, add a god damned PvP mode so we can have some actual fun after SO many hours of grinding. How hard can that be? It doesnt have to be anything special, just good old vs 4v4 or 8v8 or 12v12 or anything at all man, come on, I payed a 100$ for this ♥♥♥♥♥.   I got a bid carried away there, but, to summarize, game is not bad at all. All they need to do is stop the hackers, fix the usual bugs and glitches and add a god damned vs mode for PvP.  People say game is grindy, well, its an RPG with some MMO elements, it kinda HAS to be grindy. All such games are.  I bought this game to enjoy it with my friends, and if Ubisoft or Massive or who the ♥♥♥♥ ever made it decides they want to actually work on it a lil bit, it will be a great title.

I'm of the school of thought that doesn't hold this against a company. Sure, it might be nice to have the servers ready but anyone who has sat through an MMO launch can tell you that these things happen. It doesn't detract from the game itself.   Probably the biggest perk so far of this game's launch is that the developers listen. They've fixed bugs as they've arisen, reworked gun balance issues, and have actively engaged in discussions on both their forum and on reddit itself.   Now the game itself is absolutely beautiful. IF, and that's a big if, your PC can run it on its maximum settings it looks stunning. E3 didn't do it justice. Even on high and medium settings, it is probably the most visually stunning game I've ever played. They just get the atmosphere right. Trash, dogs, people, all of them contribute to a beautiful world where you have to fight tooth and nail to get what you want.  If you buy this game looking for a well developed story, you're going to be disappointed. There aren't a whole lot of cutscenes and character development is pretty lackluster unless you look into your intel. Even then it's not amazing. With that said, it was never really advertised as this intense story driven game. You get what you need out of it. New York is burning, quite literally sometimes, and it's your job to put it out. They do a good job at making that known as soon as the prolouge finishes. From there, it's up to you to act as you see fit in order to fight through the different missions, build your base, and work on a cure alongside your fight to restore order and deal with the various criminal organizations throughout the game. It's not a massively complicated system but at the same time it allows for a massive amount of variation.  Take, for instance, the enemies. A lot of complaints about this game came from the enemies after people rushed into the game. I'm sorry but if you give the game a terrible review a day in without having even gotten through the missions or really even experienced the game, you're a bad reviewer. Back to my point, the enemies are far more varied than what they're credited with. Especially later on in the game. There are four distinct factions. Rioters, Ritkers, Cleaners, and the LMB. Each one fights differently and has to be approached different. Rioters fill the roll of low level mobs. They're not really to be fear and are easy at every level. Ritkers are ex-cons who favor brute force to tactics. Cleaners adore fire in all its forms and this shows in how they fight. The LMB is a PMC that uses tactics, grenade launchers, and even turrets to give them as much of an advantage as they can. All of these enemies can be found in different areas and, if you're unlucky, in the same place. They will fight each other as well as you and act very differently through every fight.   Crafting, looitng, and purchases in this game are all things that are still being worked on to ensure balance is brought to the game. With that said, they're all very much viable at this time. Crafting resources are easily gotten around the map and in the dark zone or even from deconstructing your weapons. Looting is fair and balanced with an RNG system.   The only gripe that I have with the game is the PVP, where you get punished pretty heavily for going rogue which removes pretty much all incentive to do so. As a result, PVP is pretty much non-existant as people are too afraid of losing money and DZ level to strike out against others as it leads to them being hunted down for their gear. I believe, however, they are looking into a way to balance this as well.  That's my review folks.   TL;DR version: Early reviews bad. Game good. Developers listen. Much wow. Such game.",

The intel is where you really felt the gravity of the story. And with the first major patch coming in a few weeks, my excitement is only growing for this game.

And it SUCKS, mostly because ubisoft sucks and opens every door for hackers and glitch-user, like 30% of the players are hacking and u cant even find players to play normal missions with u, cause everyone just uses glitches. Not much late game content, not much to do besides shooting mobs in DZ all day and get shot by hackers from time to time. Besides this major problems im even disappointed by social system or/and reporting system. Way to annoying u cant report ingame, or a whisper function in the friendlist or something similar would be nice. And Ubisoft seems like theres no problem, just keep releaseing new missions which are easy to glitch and that will fix everything...  Also, on a side note, american players get bonus items, europe accounts cant achive because they sold it more often there. Well okay, but why the hell we get on the same servers if they got an advantage anyway?? No sense in this, but well doesnt matter cause all in all u cant play pvp for more than 3 minutes without beeing killed by hackers anyway, so ♥♥♥♥ it.  Otherwise i would have really loved the game, i may even keep playing, cause i got still a little bit faith in the game. Even if it feels like hammerpoints WarZ/Infestation right now.  ",

            "review_text": "Do u want a good story? If u do, then don't buy this game. Do u want a fulfilled experience? If u do, then don't buy this game.  Do u just want to shoot stuff or other players? If u do, then buy this game. Do u just want to shoot all of those with your friends? If u do, then buy this game.  1. repetitive missions about 5-6 different kinds. However, u have to repeat a lot. Because those provides points for u to be awesome. Some of them don't even change the landscape.  2. broken story After u finish all of those missions, u still know very little about this story, if there is one. u need missions and collectables. Missions have very few video and audio files. Collectables are all audios. And there're a large number of them. It seems Ubisoft wants me to put all of them together by myself. I don't think they put much thought into this.  3. unfriendly design Those collectables occupies a lot of time. u can only see their position after u finished all of missions in the area. And u will pass very few of them during your mission, so u have to run through the city again.  4. speechless character My character doesn't participate in any conversation! All he do is taking orders. After almost 50 hours, I have no feeling that I'm playing a TPS. If I'm a robot, it will be more fun. This also applies to all npc. They are just boring, even those basement essentials.  5. horrible server distribution I don't think u should play if u don't have friends to play it with. In the dark zone, sometimes, there are only a few players. Some more experienced players would team up, or solo, to kill other players just for sport ( don't take their stuff ). And, with the fact that there're only a few people, the result of who kills who almost never changes. Of course, I'm only lv28. I heard that once I become lv30, there will be a lot more.  Even if its true, I don't think current scenario could be regard as a good game. Dark zone is just place for players to turn on each other, or take other peoples' conquest. What is the point ? After all of those killing, all u can take away is the feeling that 'haha, I killed all those people'. Oh, forget to mention, DZ has nothing to do with the story. I, myself, like those competitive games, CSGO, Dota etc. But I hate the DZ setting. To become awesome, u need to put a lot of time to get those gears. Then u need a team, otherwise, u are most likely to be meat. Even if u succeed all of those, u are facing a place full of chaos.   The motivation to be a rebel is laughable, other players' conquests or simply u wanting them to be dead.........ARE'NT WE AT WAR? SHOULD'NT WE CAPTURE EACH OTHER TO WIN THAT?  It just doesn't make sense, game-wise or story-wise. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Above is what I think before DLCs come out.

This has been occuring everyday I get home from work wanting to play more BUT I CAN'T! Never again will i bother looking at another Ubisoft online game. Lessen learnt first hand! Everyone knows how Uplay are notorious for being the WORST online service in the gaming industry. If this game was F2P with cosmetic microtransactions, I wouldn't complain at all.

The cover system feels like ghost recon and that's a great thing. Where the game lacks is narrative. The story there but no depth. It's like yes I'll save New York but I couldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about some lame as over dramatic character that's supposed to be your friend.   One of the things I hate about this game is that your basically alone. The only time you interact with other players is in safe rooms, you get your friends and start a group or you go into the dark zone. One thing I loved about destiny or any other games like that is other people running around doing there own thing. This game feels like if your playing alone like I am that the US government only trained like 40 people and 38 of them are ♥♥♥♥ing dead and one is injured and a ♥♥♥♥♥ and then there's you. It's like 'I am legend' but you aren't will smith and you don't have a sick ♥♥♥ dog, oh and everyone's not dead. It's just you again the world out there and it's stupid. At lest Will Smith found people I just got this ♥♥♥♥ that's tells me what to do all day. I'd love to just run in to some one on the street and be like 'hey what's up you going on a mission or something??' Or them being pinned down and you save them. I know I know you can do that in the dark zone. I know but in the dark zone there's no missions. The city feels dead like this is supposed to be New York!   One of my favourite things in this games is the dark zone. I've only spent a little amount of time in it but damn is it fun. The mix of hard enemies and possibly crazy ♥♥♥♥ing people and just the fear of other people is there and also the high amount of loot is great. One of the things I love is that once you find that 'Military grade RPK' it isn't yours yet, you got to extract that puppy. You got to call that bird in and then wait a minute with high level and strong enemies rushing you. I know a minute isn't long but oh boy it is when you've got a captain level sniper pinning you down from a roof top and you've got a couple of rushers coming at you like Usain Bolt well in a snow storm. The dark zone is great it can be unprofitable at times and that's good. Adding the element of fear to a game like this is great. The idea of risk vs reward is strong and one of the things I'd keep going back.    The division is a good game and I mean good. Is it great no, is it bad no. It lacks in story, and human interaction but makes up for it in strong gameplay and mechanics so it evens out right?? But maybe they'll make up for it in the next one and you know there will be a next one. Ubisoft is going to milk this series for everything it's got. But will I buy the second one yes but if this game becomes assassins creed, call of duty, madden or any other yearly title no. I want the second to have time put into to make it great. Like take people off the next watch dogs and put them on this. It's a good game that's not to the level of greatness. I hope Ubisoft takes time with the next one and goes at it like the did with Assassins creed 1 to 2, but just hold off on the yearly thing thanks. Do i think I'll be playing The division in 6 months? Maybe. I don't know. Will I drop 55.99 for the season pass? Hell NO maybe on a steam sale. The divisions good like 7/10 but not great. Not to the level of what it could have been back when we saw it at E3 2013. Also when's that app that lets me play it on my tablet that the promised???",

After 5 hours... AMAZEBALLZ!!! The constant combat around every corner, even if your not looking for a fight, keeps you on your toes and the constant upgrades, sometimes time consuming, keeps you engaged. The bosses are difficult but not that bad, thank god for snipers. My only gripe so far, maybe, is the movement in combat in tight places gets a bit annoying. Trying to take cover, then move back, then side jump and accidently taking cover again, but if you keep the rageing to a minimum and laugh it off, you can move past it. And my BIG advice like most positive reviews have mentioned, play with a friend(s).

I wouldn't spend more than that unless you intend to delve into the multi-player gameplay. The only annoying thing so far is that the enemies are serious bullet sponges.

So unfortunately no one has understood the meaning of this game because usually people who play fps have not the slightest idea of what an RPG is, it is simply the ignorance that drives these people to give a negative evaluation to this game.   Second thing the black zone is a fantastic experience that everyone should try, in this the division is one of the best games I've ever played much more than games like Dying Light and other crap like badlands.   I played a lot to fallout 4, one of the best RPGs I've ever played and I assure you that to kill a simple raider i needed more than ten headshots to kill him then do not say crap and buy this fantastic game, I'm waiting you in the black zone!",

If you're not a fan of cover based and/or xp grinding games then you may want to stay away. The character creation is very limited and I would have prefered a more advanced system. In my time with the game, I did not use the crafting system once so can't put it down as a con/pro. Solo play is fun, but the game really comes into its stride whilst playing with friends/strangers in both the PvE campaign and the PvP Dark Zone.  The Division may still have a few small bugs but the game is now in a great place. I look forward to continuing my playthrough, and getting a chance to play the expansions.",

That said you can still travel the 'dark zone' in a co-op group and have fun but just accept that you will occaisionally be one shot by a hacker. Also dont expect to have a lot of fun playing PVP.  The PVE is excellent though.  Seems to be a lot of negative reviews about this game. Mostly from people with over 100 hours p[ay time. They must be enjoying the game to play it that much. Most of the complaints seem to be centered around the issue that the game is not what was promised (PVP in particular). For me, well, I never heard any of the promises. I just bought the game and played it (I was not involved in the beta). I did not really have any expectations. I can honestly say, I was blown away with how adictivre and fun the game is.

        {
            "review_text": "The Division intrigued me from the second I began playing the Open Beta. The game is a true cover shooter, with heavy RPG elements. It reminds me quite a bit of Mass Effect, and I love Mass Effect. I looked at the game's store page curious as to the review status of this game and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw 'Mixed'. It's kind of upsetting, as the only reason for the negative reviews seems to be the server hiccup that happened at launch (which delayed it for maybe an hour - not really that big of a deal), and the fact that the game is a Ubisoft AAA title, which I can admit made me a little biased against the game as well.   But after playing through the story and hitting max level, and spending considerable time in The Dark Zone, I can guarantee that anyone who buys this game with the right idea of what they're getting into will enjoy it. First off, let me clear up what MMO means to The Division. The game is always online, and you can always be playing with other players. But outside of The Dark Zone, and if you're not in a group, you're essentially playing by yourself, as even the global chat is turned off unless you manually turn it on. So the game /does/ have a Single-player component. Though running through some of the missions on Solo can be a bit tough, it is possible, as I completed every mission this way initially.  The gameplay itself is extremely enjoyable and thrilling. The AI in the game is smart, and will outflank and outgun you if you're not careful and prudent in your own maneuvering. They can easily pin you down and flush you from cover if you don't do something to save yourself. The AI is brutal and deadly - and I love it. (Except the f*cking Riker / LMB Rushers. F*ck those guys.) You will be challenged by this game. It requires a lot of thinking and second to second planning on your part to win some fights. Every player, as they progress through the game, will unlock better gear and weapons - but also special skills that basically determine what they do during a fight. Things like shields, seeker mines, first aid machines, etc., can all be unlocked and used to help yourself and help your teammates (if you have any). Every skill can also be changed in some way by modding it to do different things, adding even more possible combinations. Everything about your character is determined by three basic attributes that can be modified only with the gear you're wearing: Firearms, Stamina, and Electronics. Firearms determines how much damage you do, Stamina how much health you have, and Electronics determines your Skill Power, which buffs your Special Skills (doing things like strengthing your ballistic shield / increasing damage of your Seeker Mine, etc.) It's really simple and easy to get the hang of. It's easy to completely swap your build based on what you think you need for a mission, and really easy to rebuild your character if you just don't feel like what you're doing is working, especially since there is a tool in the game that lets you reroll the stats of your gear for a couple thousand credits (which isn't much). Using this tool lets you not only choose precisely what you want to choose, but also lets you choose which outcome you want from a list that it produces. All in all, it's extremely well thought out, innovative, and fun to play around with.  The graphics, too, deserve some credit. The game runs really well on most systems, including mine, at high-ultra at 1080p. I'll admit, after the Beta, I was worried about the performance of the game. But it definitely improved for the release, something I was pleased to see. Everything in the game is beautiful and lifelike, even on lower settings.  So, not only do I recommend The Division, I highly recommend it. It's a game that deserves your purchase, and your time. And when you do decide to descend into The Division, look me up. I will see you on the streets, Agent.",

Not only are there TONS of options for making your character look how you want, but the customization and upgrades to the main base are amazing as well. All the perks and the skills are very cool and fun to use. I seriously don't see any flaws in this game other than the occassional bugs or glitches here and there. But that is to be expected with a brand new game, and yes it's repetitive but it's an MMO what more do you want? Groups are super fun and I love being able to interact with other people.

The Story is okay and believable. The Intro is decent.  Yes there was a Graphics downgrade from what was initially advertised. But nowhere near the scope of Watch Dogs. It's more within the realm of acceptable in terms of promise vs reality.   This is a Covershooter with MMO elements. It's a Shooter RPG. I can't really think of many games that compare to it accurately. However I will say that people giving this game negative reviews because they personally don't like third person covershooters is kinda wrong and unethical.   Bugs are a legimate complaint. Unplayability is a legimate complaint. But being part of a Genre you don't like is not a legimate complaint. That's a preffrence. You shouldn't be warning people against the game due to Genre prefrence.   Ubisoft has alot of Hate I get that. But Credit where Credit is due. As Much as I hate Ubisoft with a Passion this is an enjoyable game for people who enjoy third person Cover shooters and RPG's.

At the time of posting this review i have over 16 hours in the game, none of which do i feel like i have wasted. I maybe be one of the lucky people who seemingly had no issues, but as most of those issues should be resolved soon then by the time people read this then it wouldnt even affect them.  Lets point out the positives: Great fun in the setting of the game. Darkzone is where it is at, but you need to bring your friends. Graphics are great. Customisation is through the roof so if you like that kind of thing then you will enjoy that.  And some of the negatives: Although the idea of the Darkzone is that of a place for PvP, it is not really encouraged. If you die when rouge then you loose DZ EXP, Credits and from what i have heard you can loose your PvE EXP as well after a point. This is all when you die as a rouge. Party sizes. The game is supose to be and MMO, but the parties are only 4. HP, now i know it is supose to be an MMO and in many MMOs there is a lot of HP however as someone that is very much into realism i do not really like this feature, but mainly when it comes to the bosses as it makes no sence. Other than that, when enemies have no armour, it works well.  Now these are my opinions and there is much more that is good and bad about this game however i dont want to make a review that people will see and be like 'TL:DR'. I hope this helps you all as i know there is a lot of really good things but also really bad things being said about this game and not much inbetween.",

Story: The story is fairly deatailed and interesting, I was invested in it the whole way. Nothing groundbreaking, but not terrable. 7/10  Gameplay: The gameplay is very repetitive and challenging. There are now special bosses with weakspots(exept the head!!!) and all the enemys are bullet sponges. The side missions are also very repetitive, they are usualy, go up to the objective, kill bad guys, singnal JTF, wait for JTF, fight more bad guys while waiting, JTF arrives, clear out rest of enemys, beat the mission. However, the gameplay is super addictive, and you always want that better loot. 7/10  Graphics: This game is beutiful, one of the best looking games I have seen in a long time. Everything is so detiled, You can even shoot out the tires on most of the static cars around Manhattin! It also has a day/night cycle and snowstorms, snow even builds up on your charictor when he/she is out side, and melts when inside. And the best part, you don't need a beast machene to run this game, I have a GTX 860M and I have no problem running this game. 9/10  Endgame: The endgame is essentualy running around the world/dark zone to complete side missions and get better loot. 5/10  PVP: The Dark Zone is where you go to get better loot and kill other players for xp. The penaly for going rouge(attacking another player unprovoked) is so high that no one kills eachother. 5/10  Overall, I would give this game a 7.5/10",

The thought of exploring a post apocolyptic New York and being able to do whatever you wanted had me extremely excited for this game. But instead here is what you get from this game - A linear, HIGHLY instanced, highly repeditive grind fest that will leave you wanting more.  Here is the entire game in short. Get mission. Go to mission. Find bad guys. Duck in cover. Wait for bad guys to stop shooting. Emerge from cover and shoot them. Move up. Repeat 1,354,754 times.  No dynamic events that impact the game. No real exploring as all missions tell you where to go and even give you a line on your screen to follow just to make sure you don't stray off. Think you will see other players wandering around? NOPE.. it is all instanced. The moment you leave the safe house you are put into your own instanced world void of any real players.

Let me try and make this easy for myself and everyone;  Positives ----------- - Beautiful graphics, even on low quality - Great performance, even on lower end PCs (A friend of mine can run it on his potato PC~ XD) - Immersive story that really encourages continued play  Middle Ground (Neither positive or negative) ---------------- - Gunplay isn't the best, but it's not horrible either... It's decent for a 3rd person shooter and decent for a tactical cover shooter and good as a story-centric MMO - Abilities are good, but feel lacking  - Weapon availability is good, as there are many different kinds of weapons, but there are far too few weapons to say that the weapons are a positive... - Character customization is mediocre... It works as a start, but it leaves me wanting more (Only about 6 styles of hair? And I can't use the same style on a second character?) - Character outfits are quite varied, but again are lacking some things that other games include by default... (Why does every hat I wear remove my characters ponytail?) - Dark Zone... A place of hackers and a place of nice people who don't kill you simply because you're another player... I've seen both sides of the DZ and it's not that bad, if you know what time of day to play...  Negatives ------------- - Poor server stability means you spend a great amount of time either lagging or being timed out... Ubisoft has improved these issues somewhat, but they still persist. Any other company would have had these problems fixed within the first week or so... - Hackers are still a problem... Bans have been slow coming and now perma-bans are going out, but it might still not be enough... - Exploitability is the core issue with the Division. Apparently Ubisoft used a client-side system to determine correct values for player gear, damage, health, etc. leading to massive issues with hackers/cheaters - Bugs and quality control seem to still have escaped Ubisofts team... Again, they've gotten somewhat better, but any other company would have fixed massive exploit bugs within a few hours/days of the community finding them. - Poor loot/crafting system means that players are constantly left farming missions to get decent gear and materials to make more gear. Also, the use of a currency system to buy blueprints for crafting means that you have to grind even more...   To conclude, The Division is a game I would recommend. It will take some getting used to, but it is a fun game. If you want a game with a story, buy it. If you want a grindy MMO, buy it. If you want a Destiny-esque experience for PVP/PVE, don't buy it...  POST 'UNDERGROUND' DLC UPDATE ---------------------------------------------------------- The DLC is focused on breathing life back into the PVE side of the game. Adding new weapons, another few gear sets, and a completely new 'area' of procedurally generated, repeatable missions, 'Underground' is definately a step towards getting the Division closer to what it should have been from the begining.",

The game is really fun to play, especially in teams (don't be afraid to use the voice chat!, you have a beautiful voice, use it) but the cool thing is you don't need to know anyone to play in teams... click on the quick match make and ur good to go!

The ONE thing I didn't like is that I had to run this game on low (I have an I7 and an Nvidia 860m, I run most modern games on high) but I think that might be an optimization issue? on any case the game still does look good on low and the gameplay so far has more than made it up for me.

            "review_text": "I don't quite understand all of the negative reviews. Perhaps gamers bought this game thinking that it was going to be something different than what it actually was.   For me, I typically do not get into M M O's. I have had poor experiences with other titles and so, I typically stay on the action shooter side of the spectrum.....COD, BF4 etc.   I think this game has a nice balance between action and looting. If you are looking to just drop in and start shooting, this is not the game for you. But, there is plenty of action in the missions and side missions to keep you happy. But, you have to pay attention to what you are doing. Its not like some zombie M M O where you kill whatever enemies are there, take the loot and move on. You have to actually plan your way through the missions to accommodate ammo usage/availability, safe zones etc. The last thing you want is to be stuck out there without any ammo or med kits. Also, you have to be aware of your level. If you are level 10 and you are trying to complete a level 16 mission, you are not going to make it no matter how hard you try.   There are a lot of details in this game, perhaps more than most people realize. Maybe that's why the nay sayers have given this game a thumbs down. But, if you like details and have the patience, you can really have some fun. If you have friends who also like that, then, the game can truly have some glorious moments.   Like any new release, there are a few bugs that will need patching. The graphics are very good. I play the game on high and ultra with a slightly better than mid level laptop (GTX 870m GPU, i7 Haswell @ 3,4 GHz, 12 Gig Ram).   The interface is good. However, it will take some time to get used to all the ways your character can interface with the world. If you are coming from the FPS world and this is your first M M O (COD, CSGO etc), getting used to the controls and using them efficiently during game play will be challenging, at first. I you are a mouse/keyboard player, I would recommend at minimum a 5 button mouse. If you have a gaming mouse, then, things will be easier. If you are using a controller, you may find combat to be a bit challenging in terms of target acquisition. I would highly recommend putting the controller down for this game.  As the game develops over the next few months, I am sure any glitches/bugs will be ironed out along with some other issues such as nerfing and buffing weapons etc.   As of right now, there does not appear to be much in the way of anti-cheat measures. From what I understand, you have to actually record someone cheating and then email it to the devs. I could be wrong about that. But, that's my understanding. But, since this is not a P2P platform and is server based, I am sure part of the near future developments will be some sort of anti cheat protocol.   At the end of the day, I can think of far worse ways to spend $60.  UPDATE - 7/5/16  We are now 3 updates in to The Division experience and I must say that my opinion of the game is still the same. But, I have since adopted a rather tarnished opinion of the game devs. The released updates thus far have added new content to the game, however, each update has been littered with bugs and glitches. The issues with each release are so bad, its almost as if the updates are not being tested prior to release. Needless to say, the issues that are associated with each release are not what anyone would expect from the a triple A studio.  Aside from the updates, the devs cannot seem to find a formula that adds balance to the game. Instead, they have made a series of changes that actually worsens what little balance there is. For instance, the devs have introduced higher level NPC's, yet, they nerfed some of the best weapons and gear sets thus addiing a measure of difficulty to the game that borders on impossible, especially for solo players.   Each update has introduced new gear sets that have consistently gotten worse. They have added talents and featurres to the new gear sets that in some cases are literally useless. One gear set actually has a talent where the player can use special bullets and not only does the talent give those bullets to each of his team mates, it gives the bullets to enemy agents as well!!   There are many more examples of where the devs have made some very qurestionable decisions that are far too numerous to mention here. Despite all of its shortcomings, the game is actually fun to play (when it actually works properly). However, I do not hold much faith that this game will enjoy a lengthy life span given all of the issues that the devs can't seem to correct.   This game is great example of an excellent concept that has been poorly executed. Purchase at your own risk.",

There is end-game content available for players that reach the maximum level of 30, complete all story missions and side missions.

But now since I had progressed to end game and geared up all orange through ultra difficulty missions and dark zone, I am amazed and impressed by the guys from Massive, that how did they freed their creativity out of the chains. The mobs are on the contrary quite diverse and interesting, and the TPS experince actually paced out the gameplay very well (more organized team works imo, not just kiting like in some FPS counterparts). I'll give it a big thumb up for what they provided so far, and curious to see what else to surprise me in the soon coming DLCs.

While my sniper rifle with about 70k dps only does about 4k damage on a body shot to a player and they do about 30k to me. I made the error of thinking that my ballistic shield, with almost 230k HP, could take a few bullets If it even defends me at all. It turns out players can still shoot ya in the face even though in your pov it looks like your players head is behind it. Oh, and the pistol seems worthless fighting players only doing 400 - 600 damage.  If you do manage to get to an extraction point with some half decent items, if you are lucky, then check your map to make sure no player killers are around. After that, go hide somewhere and wait for someone else to start an extraction somewhere else. This should distract anyone looking for easy loot and should hopefully give you enough time to extract your items.  Trying to kill an player killer when he is around buddies that haven't killed anyone (or they re-spawn to help there friend out), will try to body block your shots to make you go rouge. Which just kills the whole dark zone for me really (not that it had much going for it anyways). Why should i be punished for trying to kill a rouge agent because someone runs in front of my gun to stop my bullets? A+ mechanics...  The dark zone adds nothing new to the game other than the possibility of broken PVP and the same PVE with more baddies that take even more damage than the last batch.   Ballistic Shield is very buggy : If you happen to deploy this while standing to close to and object and a wall, you may clip though the wall and fall into the void. Or you get stuck and have to kill your self with grenades because you can't fast travel while stuck in combat.... Also, it won't deploy while RUNNING, but it will still go on cool down. Not like I needed to get away from the AI with the shotty anyways.  Sometimes, my gun won't even fire its bullets while this shield is deployed. OR even Worse, it will fire the bullets, but will hit the ballistic shield because it is bugging out.  Another thing with the damn shield, ( yes it is that damn buggy), I can't switch my weapons SOMETIMES if i go to use cover. No clue why, other than lack of testing because it happens so easily.  Challenge mode: Don't even try to solo this bs. It is like trying to fight every AI as an endgame boss bullet sponge.  AI: Don't count on the JTF to help you at all really. The only thing the JTF are good for is dying so you don't die. They rarely kill any of the enemies, and only seem to be a distraction to them. The enemy AI is not that bright. They will either charge at ya or run in the same patterns over and over again. 'Bosses' do the same thing as well.  The mini radar: This thing will lie to you, especially in the dark zone. Thinking that you have found loot because it shows up on the radar, then see that the box can't be open for some reason. No explanation why the ordinary box can't be open ( and no, it is not the key or DZ level boxes). Also, don't trust the scanning ability, the AI will spawn behind you anyways for a surprise attack, even though only '1' treat was detected.  Civilians: You will see the same animations for them over and over again. They do nothing special, other than take your items unless you move weirdly. Then they get mad and basically call you the worst person on earth. Also, there is this one civilian who is just moving boxes around. I happen to bump into him ( because i am a jerk) and the boxes just vanish. It is like he had no boxes at all and goes on acting like the rest of the idiot civilians.  One other thing that bothers me, you can't kill Civilians. I blew one up on mistake because i shot some AI's backpack and the civilian just runs out of the explosion like nothing happened to him. Not much else to say about that really.  The fun missions: Go from point A to point B killing the same wave of enemies. Or defend an area so the useless JTF don't die. If defending the JTF is not for you, how about stopping a drug deal going down by killing everyone, then defending the drugs from being blown up... Would that not be a good thing though?  Anyways, missions are boring because you do the same damn thing every time in a new area.   Selecting grenades and snack foods:  I haven't even used the food based items because I don't want to use my med-kits by mistake. You have to hold down the heal button in order to bring up a selecting wheel that you have to use with the mouse in order to pick the item you want. Same goes for the grenades as well... takes up a ton of time just to do one simple thing. The selecting wheel it self seems a little finicky as well, so you will probably pick the wrong item.  Incendiary/explosive rounds: After you select one of these from the selecting wheel, you have a chance to deal fire or explosive damage. To bad it seems so random that these bullets can't be relied on to do what they are meant to do. Bonus points if the explosive rounds decide to work when the bad guys get in your face. ---------------------------- conclusion: I have played better FTP (Free To Play) games that had more customization and variety of enemies than this 60$ game even offers. Even worse, the DLC they are adding should have been part of the game to begin with to even come close to justify the 60$ price tag. You would think that with about 3 or 4 years of development that this game would have more content than what it has now.",

If you play with friend in Co-op is amazing game but this is only for a short time because the missions are the same and after you reach lvl 30 in Dark Zone the challenging is over.  I hope that in next DLC's for this game to have raid (more than 20 people in the party), to bring something that make every caracter unic.  Beautiful world. Very cool idea.

For some, DZ may not be fun for some considering you can lose your gears and DZ rank but, this is why people have an alt character they use to go rouge on where they can lose as much dz as they want basically an open world pvp.

        {
            "review_text": "First the bad.  - Mediocre standard run of the mill apocalypse style story. It doesn't really go anywhere or make the virus feel dangerous or anything of the sort for your gameplay. It's just a thing that's there, and contaminated areas might as well be contaminated with cooties. It's a supervirus that can spread trough air, water, contact etc etc.. And someone did it because Y and group X now tries to do the right thing.  - Still has a few bugs here and there that can require a restart. Mind you, during the time I've played it, I ran into bugs maybe 3-4 times.  - Still has connection issues during the time when the bulk of the US gaming population hops on. I'm based in Europe and have played with people from all over the world already, so it doesn't look like the game is region locked at all.  Now for the good.  - I really really enjoy the gameplay of it. It's simplistic, clean and well executed.  - Easy to use crafting system. You get 5 materials with 3 qualities. You can upgrade 5 lower tier for a higher tier, it's easy to collect them and crafting an item only requires 2-3 different materials. No need to craft a bolt system, stock, barrel, etc etc etc to make one gun. Just gather the mats and make it. You can also deconstruct loot you get to turn it into crafting materials.  - I really enjoy the darkzone areas and the pvp aspect included. Going rogue on your own is nearly impossible, unless there are just not alot of people online. If you want to play the big bad wolf, get a group of 3 others, find a good spot to defend and go HAM. And if you loose, you're going to loose out on quite a bit of XP, DZ cash and DZ keys. I REALLY like this bit, because it means you actually have to think about when it's worth trying and when it's not. It means that the run of the mill duchebags that just try and shoot you for funsies usually get put down really fast. It also means that people that plan ahead and form their own little 4 man hunting squad, can do really really really well and stack up a ton of XP for it.   The coop part of the darkzone is amazing as well, because more often than not, you'll end up in a group with just a bunch of 3 random people that usually turn out to be decent folk. Just use your voicechat and communicate to people, and you're bound to make friends out there in the DZ. But for the love of god, turn your mic to push to talk.  - Endgame content. Okay so there's not a great deal of this in teh game yet.. But what I've seen so far has been amazing in terms of gameplay. You can redo missions on challenging difficulty, which bumps all enemies up to level 32 and makes them elites. It also boosts the number of enemy spawns, pumps up their damage to the level where 1 shotgunner getting behind your group can completely decimate you. It's HARD. The difficulty curve from hard to challenging is insane and it's why I love it. It REQUIRES teamwork, cooperation, working together to overcome the enemies. And you get rewarded for it in the end. There's just something about how it all comes together, the gameplay, the random groups, the teamwork that comes from it all.. It's just all very satesfying.  - Item system. Again, I really like this because it's simplistic, yet complicated. It's very easy to get into it, to understand what to do and what not to do. To realize that you can build pretty much whatever, and have it work if it's your playstyle. You can be a glass cannon, you can be the tanky brawler or you can be the tech guy that CC's and blows everything up, or the one that heals everyone.. the sniper, the glass cannon shotgunner that abolishes players in the blink of an eye.. It all comes together and allows you to be exactly what you want to be. It's classless and one moment you can be set up as a glass cannon sniper, but switch out your gear, talents and abilities, and now you're a tanky healer. Or a whatever. Combine stuff on the fly and build it all around your own playstyle. That you get all options open to you without having to arbitrarily figuring out which spesific class suits you best, just works. It might mean there's less replayability in that you don't need 1 of every class but at the same time, the game doesn't feel limiting.  Overall I've had a really good time with this game so far, and I got exactly what I expected out of it. For the price, you'll get a good amount of hours out of it all and that alone makes it worth the price, I think. Moderate your expectations and realize that until more content get put in, you'll probably not have more than 50-60 hours of gameplay before you run out of stuff to do and have pretty good and optimal gear for your playstyle. But that's better hours/price value that a lot of other AAA games have come up with, and given that there's going to be much more content in it as time goes on.. I'd say it's worth it.",

I also noticed that these side missions and supply missions took place in the same structures or interiors, all the way up until the very last zone, which for me made the game feel even more repetitive and dumbed down than necessary. At level 30, you are really supposed to take on the dark zone, but I really don't see any point in doing it anymore, no territory or resources to fight over, just the same loot you have had from the start with bigger number values.

Gear drops are ****, even the yellows, any good gear is crafted 'Full release' makes you wait to play the game with updates that will probably be less than 10 hours of game time a piece  Overall:  Ubisoft had a good idea, but they tried to mix a singleplayer story based FPS and a MMO and ended up just making the game a contest to see who grinds the hardest the fastest. If they fixed the loot, made PVP worth something, added more ingame content, made something worth your time once you get to level 30, cause PVP is repitive and boring, and DZ is just good for grinding gear to deconstruct to craft actually good gear, dailies are repitive and give you nothing worth it 95% of the time besides pheonix credits, and chose wether they wanted a CO-OP shooter or a MMO RPG shooter they would have a good game, but right now, its not worth the $60 to grind out levels for 15 hours and grind gear for 30 hours just pvp for 5 and then you're already so burnt out of the game that its boring.  4/10 you shouldnt have to pay 40$ on top of a 60$ game just to make it worth buying. hopefully they can make the game worth the 60 in future updates",

But shouldn't happen, especially on a AAA title  Limited Character Customization. KINDA disappointed about this. Also related, no way of changing your character model once accepted, and this sticks out for me because they added sunglasses into the game. If they were gonna add sunglasses or any kind of optical ware, it should've been a cosmetic choice similar to jackets or hats.   This is after 10 hours into the game. Personally I'm enjoying it, but I enjoy the loot grinding and I absolutely LOVE the Dark Zone. I'm sure once we get into the main chunk of the game after the major updates, things will be different.",

Thank god this is not a CoD clone, or I'd go insane for paying that much money for such a game. (I'd say it could be cheaper, around 45 euros, but it is well worth paying).  I dislike that there aren't many customization options for your character, but there's a bunch of clothing for you to wear after finding them. Which is nice. Another thing that might bother you is that it can be a bit grindy and stale after a while (or so I've heard), enemies seeming 'dumb', but from my experience it's rather fun and enemies are usually quite smart. Loading times might bother you too, as they can get a bit long on weaker systems.

I guess I'll make a counter-argument.  1) Get a better pc if your graphics card isn't the best. Don't put down something just because it's your fault. And for christ's sake don't say 'MGSV had better optimization', well no ♥♥♥♥ sherlock. That game had more than the time The Division needed to develop. And don't quote me on this, but I think if the game is mostly done you should probably try to optimize the hell out of it. So The Division had much less time for optimization than ♥♥♥♥ing MGSV did. 2) (Uplay pun here) is literally like every Ubisoft review ever. Stop ♥♥♥♥ing saying that ♥♥♥♥. Jesus. 3) The Grind. 'Hi, I'm a steam reviewer and I don't know what a genre entitles games.' It's a ♥♥♥♥ing MMO. WOW was a grind. RuneScape is grindy as ♥♥♥♥. So is Destiny. Why are you complaining? Is it because maybe you shouldn't have bought this game because your an idiot? Yeah, probably.   Lesson of the day is that you should never trust steam reviews because if something goes wrong with the game the game is immediately bad according to gamers.

The server issues are a bit annoying, but hey, it's just the first week of the game, give it time and it will become better ( I hope). Doing side-missions are fun. A bit repetitive I admit, but the dialog between the thugs, the npcs when you get there, kind of make up for it.

Most of the negative reviews are just about server crashes, and most of them are from EU gamers. Most EU gamers were just really angry because of the server crashes when the floodgates were opened to the Americans. I'm American, so I was perfectly fine with it, lol. I haven't recieved any issues, but you must follow the requirements for the game, spec wise, or you won't be able to run the game. PERIOD. I have a GTX 960, and I run 60 FPS, so I think its pretty good. You should be fine with a GTX 660 and run about 45-55 FPS easily, on low. The graphic settings don't really make a difference though. The graphics are not horrible, but they are not amazing, unless you run Ultra settings. The graphics are pretty much up to par on todays expected graphics from a high-end game like the Division. Overall, I would 100% recommend this game to someone, as long as they have the PC to run it. If not, then your experience will suck, I assure you that. Bottom line, get the PC that's good enough to run the game, if you don't have it already, and it will be 60 USD very well spent. Great potential for the game, looking forward to the upcoming updates.",

That being said, Been playing for a short time now and what I've seen I really like so far. Sure the AI could be a bit better in terms of tactics; and I would love it if while you were wandering around the city, you got ambushed by enemies in building windows or on accessible rooftops. While it doesn't have that ambush mechanic there are scattered IEDs, which does add to some tension in some areas; but it'd be better if enemies attacked after they went off.  I wish there was a jump and crouch function, meaning that I would like a key to assign to a jump and crouch function, since I'd probably hop around on top of vehicles like an idiot in open world type scenarios.  The combat mechanics are pretty solid with each weapon (and higher level weapon of the same, i.e. Police M4) having their own unique stats and pros/cons. All of the hats, jackets, shirts, pants, boots, and scarves are cosmetic so there's no need to worry about finding the 'right' one to build up your character; as they're more for looks than performance. Items like kneepads, gloves, backpacks, vests, etc do have an impact on your character stats so you also have to balance them like you do with your weapons.  Mission variety can be a bit repetitive as far as side missions go, but I honestly don't mind as I've done but a few of them as I mostly wander around and find all the little things that you can find (mostly cosmetic items or weapons). Weapon customization is pretty cool, with various grips, magazines, muzzle attachments, and sights/scopes. Haven't really messed with gear mods yet so I don't know what to say on that.  As an NA player, had to wait a little while for the servers to launch correctly after release, and have some issues with performance as it uses up a lot of my gpu (not the absolute best but also not the absolute worst). A couple crashes and some server disconnects, but nothing major and something that should be expected on a freshly launched game of the MMO variety.  At any rate, this is my opinion on the game, my first impressions and I'll leave you to make up your own mind toward this game. Watch some youtube vids, watch some streams of your friends if they play it, and come to your own conclusion rather than listening to the tirades of people who hate connection issues or Ubisoft in general. I don't play a lot of their games mostly because I either couldn't afford them most times or haven't been able to since I had a low tier gaming laptop I used.  TL;DR version,  Gameplay is good, some things could be better, small details in my opinion. Server issues at start with a couple crashes, but overall I'd give it a 15/10 since I'm a fan of open world games, and this game takes that genre to a nice level I've been wanting.",

Everything in the game, from the shooting mechanics, the cover system (which is one of the best I have experienced), the storyline, the levelling and gear system has all been done before. But The Division does it really well.  The graphics are pretty good. I won't comment on performance because I have a 980ti and there hasn't been a game that I can't play on high with a smooth frame rate, but needless to say it runs nicely. The only bad thing I can say about the graphics is that I see a few glitches every now and then, that are in no way detrimental to the experience.   Throughout the game, you can pick up bits of 'evidence' that further explain the story. These are images from drones, phone recordings and 'echoes' which are reconstructed scenes from history. They provide a little more insight into the story. The videos are really well done, to the point where some even seem terrifying. As in, wow as humans we really did this to each other? The audio recordings are good too, you really get to feel how scared people were just as the outbreak started.  The story is your typical apocalyptic-♥♥♥♥-just-got-real type story. The characters in the game are well voiced and none of them have really stood out as lame or over the top. Although the story makes it seem like survival is of the utmost importance, it really doesn't feel like that when playing the game. I have never felt as if I am in any danger, and I am free to roam about the city, whether I'm in the dark zone or not. Sure there are some people out to kill me (including players, if you're in the dark zone) but if they kill me, so what? I don't really lose anything and I respawn at a safe house. Then I just jump back in and try again.  The gameplay consists mostly of hiding behind something and shooting when you can. It's a lot of fun, but definitely repetitive. Each fight is mostly the same, regardless of whether you change your abilities or weapons - none of this seems to drastically affect your playstyle, which is my main complaint for the gameplay. Levelelling up seems to have decent progression, but once you get to level 15, it seems mostly the same. With that said, I am still enjoying the game, just due to the fact that everything is so well made. The complete package, although nothing innovative, it still just as enjoyable to play. Much like every time you eat a BLT.  Overall if you're looking for something innovate and original that redefines the genre, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a game with solid mechanics (despite being a little repetitive), a decent story with good acting and good levelling/progression, this is the right game. One final note I'd like to add is - play the game with friends. You can totally play by yourself with no problem, but friends, or at least joining up with people online make the game much more fun, especially when you play the missions on the harder difficulty.  8/10 [for those that like ratings].",

After playing the beta for a few hours I was really unsure about whether or not this was just another overhyped game. I'm about 13 hours into the game (would be playing now but server is down for maintenance, that's just part of playin an MMO) and I have really enjoyed it so far.   Graphics- Great, I have a good rig, not a super computer but I can run everything on ultra at about 50 fps, maybe a bit more. The atmosphere is well done and character models look pretty darn good. I would say that if you're PC is three or four years old that it might struggle on the higher settings.  Gameplay - The gameplay is maybe a step above good. Missions have been fairly repetitive with the exception of the main story but shooting up baddies with a large array of guns is enjoyable enough so that the side quests are still fun. Controls are pretty smooth so no complaints there.   Story - Again, like gameplay it's good, maybe not stellar. That being said I'm not even halfway done with the main story line and have yet to do anything in the dark zone. Overall it's fairly immersive and if you take the time to find the evidence (cell recordings, camera footage etc.) as you run around it adds a nice touch. The world itself feels very much like one that has just experienced a large scale shutdown of society and I'm curious to see what the rest of the story reveals.   MMO things - I've grouped up for a few missions and it is enjoyable to do so. Haven't played with a group of friends yet and I imagine that can only make things even better. Crafting is pretty straightforward but good. The items so far have been useful but I hope endgame crafting steps things up a notch. Although you have the freedom to go pretty much wherever you wish, there aren't a bunch of other players running around with you unless you're in a group. This is nice because you aren't fighting over mobs etc but it does make the world seem kind of empty (this does add to the post apocolyptic feel of the world though). Plenty of loot but hopefully will be more world drops in dark zone. Customization is pretty good with a decent array of talents, abilities, and perks. Character customization on the other hand is rather lackluster.   As for things I don't like there haven't been any glaring issues or things I just can't stand. The exp grind is definitely not the most engaging but it's good enough. To be honest I don't have too many negative things to say.  My final thoughts are these. Is the game fun? Absolutely yes! It's engaging and fairly immersive and the smooth controls and variety of ways to blow your enemies to bits has been a blast, no pun intended. Again, I give it an overall 8/10 and I am happy with my purchase.",

A lot of bugs, graphic tears,crafting sucks,and pvp is Loaded with Hackers,that teleporting and one shot kill people. Crafting it's stupid because you have a hard time to farm the Rare Division Tech mats and then when you go to craft, it doesn't craft what you want but it rolls an attribute,means you may make 50 guns to get one right. You can learn all recipes in game and still you will NOT be able to craft what you want. you can buy some equipment that vendors sell for a price in game coins (phoenix credits) that after a while you have nothing to spent. Gear are unbalanced with ridicilus properties,High end gear dropping from bosses and in the Dark Zone (pvp) its worthless.! hackers roaming the Dark Zone kill you and you can't do a squat to stop it, they moving outside games boundaries to avoid get killed ,and so on.Paradice for Hackers !! good luck ",

I like playing straightforward action packed missions with my friends. 2. The Darkzone is incredibly fun with friends and even alone. There is always tension there. 3. The gameplay is very smooth, stable and looks great.  The most important factor why I recommend this game is the straightforward but very fun game design for the Darkzone. If you like alot of open PvP action then I can only recommend it to you.",

Pros + Loot - modern firearms is an angle that hasn't been hashed and rehashed yet. + Character Customization - TONS of clothing options and items to make your character feel unique + Third person shooter mechanics in an MMO  + Interesting story in the Tom Clancy Universe + PvP and PvE integration in Dark Zones + Highly replayable  Cons - Server Issues - a lot of people have been experiencing issues with the servers but, from my perspective, most of those appear to have been fixed. - Texture glitches - sometimes an area won't render properly even though I know my computer can handle it. - Character creation - fairly generic with not a lot of diversity. You'll occasionally encounter someone who made the same toon as you did. Also female faces...please add more options. - Running, running, running. You spend a lot of time doing it and if you're not used to MMOs, it can be really boring. There is fast-travel but you're still running 90% of the time to your destination.  All in all, a very fun game and I thoroughly enjoy it. I may not have played much of it since release but when I'm done with my real life responsibilities, I find my time occupied with The Division and not regretting my purchase. If you like loot-driven MMOs with RPG aspects, like myself, this will definitely be up your alley.",

            "review_text": "I've been enjoying The DIvision so far. After 11 hours in, I think I've got a pretty good feel for it. The game plays, essentially, like a post-apocalyptic Destiny (which isn't NECESSARILY a bad thing). That is, it's a loot-centric shooter in an open world,   Sadly, teh game's open world, while quite open, feels relatively devoid of life. Unless in a mission area, a contaminated zone, or at an encounter site, there aren't too many things to shoot, and civilians are generally few and far between as well it feels like. Fitting for a plague-ravaged NYC, yes, but also kind of disappointing for a game.  The missions, however, feel rather solid, with a fine variety and a decent level of difficulty that is tuned almost perfectly, it feels like, to group-play, as well the game should. Solo, however, several mission segments (namely the rather frequent 'defend this area from wavse of enemies' sections) can feel overwhelming if played alone. With a group, or even just one person as your companion, the game takes on an entirely new dimension that's just... The only word for it really is, wonderful: as your tactical options are increased exponentially. Complex and true-to-life tactics are very viable in teh game for those that want to try them out.  The gunplay feels pretty solid and enjoyable. Each gun feels and handles somewhat differently, and they are quite customizable with between one and four enhancement slots available depending on the type of gun (sights, magazine, barrel-attachment, and muzzle), allowing you to fine-tune your weapons into whatever you feel is most appropriate. A fifth slot, for weapon paint-jobs, is available as well, but they don't appear to have any meaningful effect on the weapon, and are purely cosmetic. The variety there, however, seems to be rather lacking as I've seen only one paint scheme, and that is unlocked via UPlay points, recieved by completing various achievements and milestones in the game that you can exchange via the UPlay option on the menus for cosmetic and out-of-game bonuses like soundtracks or concept art, mostly.  The story's pretty rote and predictable from what I've seen. Elite soldiers go in and disappear into the plague-ridden city. A second group is sent in, and you're part of that as you try to unravel the twin mystery of what happened to your comrades as well as, more importantly, restore order to the city and maybe, just maybe track down and bring the man responsible for the plague to justice. I know some might complain of spoilers, but really, it's so formulaic I doubt anyone's REALLY going to be surprised that those are the goals.  Ubi seems to have learned, as well, from the disaster a few years ago that was Assassins Creed Unity as well as Far Cry 4 and WatchDogs; meaning that The Division runs pretty handily. At least in my experience. The only issues I had were when I first launched the game some issues with ane xtended black-screen in the first minutes after the midnight release (presumably some sort of synch error with UPlay locking me out of the game despite allowing me to load up), and later on two server-desynchs caused - also that same night - by server strain it would seem. There were minor issues too with rewards not showing up in the vendor immediatesly; but that was fixed relatively quickly and I've long since recieved my pre-order stuff.  On the whole, the game is pretty solid and well-worth a look if you want a nice party-based shooter for PC. It looks pretty good, plays solidly.",

Had quite a few compatibility issues and whatnot to sort out but they were all easy fixes. The main release has been improved in this regard and that's exactly what needed to happen.  Ubisoft went above and beyond with detail; graphics-wise I'm really impressed with all the options and how well it suits lower end computers instead of just catering to the highest bar. Nvidia Surround at release is something that isn't too common these days and I'm happy to see support.  Gameplay is incredibly fun and while it may not be the most immersion riddled game around, I am constantly looking for firefights and chances to get that shiny new piece of gear. Most people who say it's repetitive probably aren't a fan of hack and slash games like Diablo. This game is not meant to be the most realistic, it is in fact an RPG, and while it may have a grind for gear, the progression is constant and makes almost every new drop a step further. This game is not CoD nor was it meant to be compared to as such.   Content is another complaint I keep hearing about and quite honestly there is more than enough to keep me occupied for months perhaps years once expansions start to drop. There are plenty of main missions that make you progress through the levels and want to explore new areas of the city. The Dark Zone, while a bit formidable and menacing at first has become quite a lot of fun either alone or with a group and should be avoided like the plague concidering you have much higher drop chances from enemies.  The leveling can be a bit of a grind at times but do some missions and you'll get pulled right in. I actually commend Ubisoft for taking a chance with something different and challenging and am overall impressed with the game.  In my opinion this is the kind of rejuvenation and change the gaming industry needed by stepping out of the box.   I give it a 8.5/10. If your thinking about getting it but are straying due to the reviews, I say just try it; there is a reason Steam allows for returns ;P ",

No weird, quirky characters, no BS, no real fluff - just you, your mates and your guns against a whole crap load of people who want you dead. And it's fun carving through that.  The gameplay puts an emphasis on tactics and creates hectic situations that can be legitimately frustrating when first approached, creating several panic scenarios. But as long as you and your partners are around the same level, nothing is ridiculously overpowered or difficult; quite the contrary, even. When you start investing in your gear and skills, YOU become the most dangerous thing on the streets. You still only get a few shots before your health bars evaporate, but that's usually enough to wake you up from a long walk down a city street overflowing with trash bags, rats and disheveled cars before you duck behind some cover and start figuring out what to shoot. It almost gets catharic after a while, when you've adapted your play style, gotten comfortable and dug in - you feel like a gristled veteran who's weathering a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scenario and doing a very specfic job while folks back at your base of operations handle logistics.   You're the task op. You're the guy out there getting ♥♥♥♥ done. And it shows and conveys that very well.  Story's simple enough and handled in a way that's at least interesting and down-to-earth enough to be enjoyable. The recordings you pick up sound like actual people talking, not like the laughable deadpan snarkers in Prototype 2 or the super gruff and grit-blooded supersoldiers like in Metal Gear. You're all people in a complete crapstorm, and you get to see and hear how people are weathering it. Some do better than others. Hell, hearing a few of the Rikers and Cleaners talk about their people and experiences even made me bust out laughing - there's some great potential for black comedy in this game, and they throw in just the right amount to mix things up.  There are a lot of heartwarming moments, too, if you care to find them. Your base turns into a rather nice and calming shelter for the survivors that wander to it, and the upgrades are described as things people would actually need in a crisis - from quarantine and medical wings to water purifiers to recharge centers for people's smartphones. People in those situations want to contact their loved ones if they're displaced or living abroad - and that's a nice touch of realism. It keeps things from feeling too gloomy.  That said, there are some REALLY gloomy bits. Like, REALLY dark. When I said you hear about survivors and the insurgents dealing with things in a lot of ways? This game doesn't shy away from the dark stuff. Hell, one recording even detailed a veteran Riker giving advice to a new recruit on how to subjugate groups of survivors, giving details like getting children to comply by shooting their dogs if needed. That's dark - but that's real. It's little touches like this that make the game all the more atmospheric.  Game still has its flaws, though. You'll get stuck on cover and take a few cheap shots fairly often until you get the controls down, and even then, the game tends to think you're stuck to your cover like glue. Pulling away from it in a pinch is frustrating at times. The side missions are a bit repetitive, but there's no real grind - you can max out your base well before anything gets too boring. Your mileage may vary, but hell, that's how it felt to me.  Bottom line, though? It's a good game. Opting in for the season pass bumps the price up to around $100, though, which is completely insane. Holy hell, is that insane. Like, good flipping GOD. The game's good and all, but even with everything I've said up above, I STILL have a hard time completely justifying shelling out a hundred bucks for the game and the season pass! Pick that up only if you try the game and like it.  tl;dr - Game's alright, story's solid, very atmospheric, good combat, great with friends, side missions can be repetitive, EFFIN' EXPENSIVE",

            "review_text": "So this is an edited review. My last review I was only level 10 and had only played a few hours. Now im level 25 and have played 35+ hours. Which isnt alot compare to some but still. And for those that may not read this entire review, GET THE GAME!!! It is Awesome!! It is Everything an open world, RPG, third person shooter should be. Customization, Guns, and Explosions. What else do you need?? But for a post apocalyptic world, there are no zombies. Hopfully in a future DLC they will add some sort of Zombie.   I cant really list cons to this game. Im not that picky of a gamer. Just give me a gun and something to blow up and im happy. But.....a problem I experienced is when I went to play it my first time the screen was black. So I googled it and everyone said to fix the resolution, so I changed the resolution and I havnt had that problem since. And my display driver kept shutting down, so I had to do a little computer maintenance and My display driver hasnt shutdown since. So really the only problems Ive had were on my end and not the game. But that is really what all the negative reviews are about any way, people complaining about techical issues that they could fix with a little computer know how.    The only con that can think of is the Level cap........Im already level 25. So im only 5 levels away from the level cap. I had hoped that is would take a little longer to reach level 30. Here in a month everyone will be level 30. So if we dont get a DLC that raises the level cap then it could get really boring really fast.   There are a few aspects of the game that I really enjoy. I love the gun customizations and loadouts plus the skills. There is a gun and skill for every kind of player. With the gun mods you can turn an average gun into a great gun and specialized gun into a superior gun. You just have to find the right mods. It does have a decent story that you can follow and tons of missions and side missions. And even if you dont want to do those you can just explore.   Also the gun mechanics are very realistic. When you fire, the gun does not just make a sound and the reticule stays in the same spot like COD. There is RECOIL. Much like BattleField. Controling that recoil takes some getting used to. And there is no quick scoping either. Yes you can in a way quickly aim and get a headshot which I have done but its still difficult. But Marksmen rifles are really only effective with a headshot. And you wont get sniped by a shotgun either. Shotguns are powerfull but very limited by range. So for every situation there is a gun that excels. Which is why its a good idea to carry one of each weapon type to be prepared to everything and if you run out of ammo in your favorite gun.   So......The Dark Zone......I actually enjoy the Dark Zone, even with all the rogue agents trying to steal your loot. The gear you get there are far superior to gear outside the DZ. I have met more friendly agents than rogue. I have been killed by rogue agents and they really ♥♥♥♥ me off. But the feeling of revenge is even better!!! Extraction are a bit nerve racking.........you cant trust anyone. The guy that has helped you clear out the area could just as easy shoot you in the back, or you could shoot him first ;) But like I said, I havnt run into many people willing to risk going rogue. But we will see if that changes by the time im level 30.",

Initially there was some super bad lag for bullets registering as hits on enemies, even in singleplayer, which was fixed when the servers came back up. There's occasional texture pop in even on high end cards. Essentially, if you look for something to be wrong with the game, you'll find it, probably pretty easily to be honest.  However, with all the negatives, I'm enjoying this game immensley. Some will complain about bullet sponge enemies and it not being realistic. That's fine, this game isn't really focused on that. It's more in the vein of a Tom Clancy: Borderlands in Third Person style gameplay. If you're looking for some fun coop with friends in a coop RPG shooter, this is a wonderful pick for it. Essentially, if you know what the game is before you get into it, or you played the beta, you already know what to expect, and honestly it's pretty good at what it does. It might not be flawless, but honestly I've not played a game that is, and sometimes there are bugs, as with just about every game. However, the positive coop/singleplayer experience I've had thus far completely outweighs them. If you watch the devs stream it, you can tell that they're genuinely proud of the game and enjoy it, and I can't help but say that I enjoy it as well. There have been minor frustrations (when the servers went down I got cut out in the middle of a 'long' mission, and had to repeat it multiple times) but all in all, I've had a blast. It's a Tom Clancy game, so you can come to expect a Tom Clancy story. (I've enjoyed all of them that I've played) in a RPG shell. It's wonderful, does it's job, kicks ♥♥♥, and brings you back for more.  with the negatives, I give it a 9.0/10, for the solid, enjoyable coop/singleplayer experience: Tom Clancy shelled Third Person RPG.",

They do convey the attitude. Menus and interface. You can tell it is designed for a game pad rather then a keyboard and mouse, and in some areas a better interface would be possible if only made for the PC, but overall it works and in the main part, the game play it does not affect you. Mostly in crafting, inventury and such parts. Connectivety. So far so good, in 16 plus hours only last link one time and was able to hook right back in. And I am playing it from Asia with a very unreliable network and still seems ok.  Gameplay, Its ok, you have several larger misssion that get you started bulding your base, and bunch of smaller missions that either gain you resources to build your base, or give you items and or blue prints for crafting. All pretty standard stuff. I am now level 10 and even though I was able to solo the lower main quests, it does become more apperant that team play is the way to go to tackle the later quests. Some of the Boss mobs just require team work to take down. Though I am sure somebody will figure out how to solo it.  Overall I must say I had allot of fun up to this point.

But it just ends up lacking in the core game aspect of it all which is just a simplistic, cover-based third-person shooter with some survivor elements tacked in.  What it does do well in is the incredibly immersive environment where you will find yourself traversing. Parkour through building rooftops and goal-oriented tasks as well as arena fights akin to similar MOBA games will keep it immersive. But even that is lacking as well and at times, even too easy. The game will show you the way to each goal like a GPS directional assist which breaks the immersion and makes the game incredibly linear in terms of gameplay.

Pros: -Awesome Sound. -Great, smooth gameplay &amp; graphics (I suppose this does depend on your machine to a degree of course, but the way areas are split into instances really helps a high end graphical MMO 3ps actually work for most).  -Plenty of houses/apartments to loot -Tons of enemies to kill. Despite the negative reviews, there are actually tons of different clans and very different enemy types to kill if you just play the game a bit further.  -Super easy to find a team through matchmaking if you don't already have one but don't want to do a certain mission alone.  -Gun customization is nuts. -You find clothing skins right from the start, so you can be a baller in a matter of hours.  -Storyline is actually pretty great, as I typically find to be the case in a Clancy game.  -Skill tree is quite intricate and expansive once you level up a bit and start earning talents. -Endless amount of things to upgrade/find. -Endlessly spawning side-quests all over the world if you just want to grind, though they are optional if you don't.  -Contaminated and Dark Zone ideas are really cool and well implimented.    Cons:  -I had to wait like 2 hours at midnight launch to play the game... cry me a freakin' river lol.  -UPlay is kind of a chore, but not a big deal once you have it set up.   This game rocks. 10/10. It has the awesome cover shooter elements of the Deus Ex series, the looter/shooter solid aspects of games like Destiny, and the incredible sound/graphics and story of what we've come to expect from a Tom Clancy Game. I can't wait to keep playing this.",

            "review_text": "For seasoned players, certain AR graphical pointers can be turned off – such as the GPS navigation system. But for casual gamers and those starting out, these are why it is so easy to leap into the game without little preamble. The AR navigation line snakes its way through streets to mission points marked on the map or, if you are in building on a mission itself, to the next objective. You cannot get lost, basically.  In addition, whenever you are next to an item you can pick up, a barrier you can duck behind, or an object you can manipulate or use, you get a button indicator showing exactly what you need to press. Who needs the tutorials eh? So far, we’ve played a fair selection of different mission types, on our own and with a ragtag bunch of online acquaintances. Teams of up to four players can co-operatively take part in the missions, which you can make up in the safe houses dotted around, from friends or simply by checking out if others are available at that moment, but we didn’t feel punished by tackling objectives on our own (as much as we do in, say, Destiny). Taking on main and side missions solo is a harder pursuit for sure – even if you are sometimes helped by AI JTF agents – but there’s something to be said for giving yourself that kind of challenge. You can also up the difficulty level for tasks too, before you start each. As well as main story missions, which initially help expand and improve your base of operations, there are plenty of side missions dotted around the map. We’ve found them to be of fairly standard types and some can be quick to complete, including the hostage rescue and a base assault missions. That helps as, with the persistently online world, you won’t be able to pause and pick up later. If you want a quick bout of The Division, these are there for exactly that purpose, it seems. They also help you or your base level up more quickly. In gameplay terms, Ubisoft has presented a game that doesn’t really break much new ground, but works because of the familiarity. The duck and cover mechanics of The Division are essential and standard for many third-person shooters. Where this differs from many of its peers is that enemies are genuinely hard to take down. Thanks to the role-playing elements, enemies have stamina points rather than a set number of hits, so depending on what weapon you use, the modifications and your own skill set, each hit will cause a different amount of damage – which you see in numeric manifestations during battles. Enemies also hide behind cover and some have armour, so they are taken into account too.  In our several hours of play so far we’ve had to restart missions plenty of times because we’ve been overwhelmed by difficult to beat waves of bad guys who don’t just fold at the wave of an SMG. And that’s the way we like it. It’s just as well really as the game is a bit one-note in its tone – at least to the point where we’ve ended up in the game. Working out ways to dispatch foes using the talents and tools at your disposal is just about it. Missions have different objectives and goals, and exploration around New York is rewarded, but if you don’t like long, at times tricky armed battles, you’re barking up the wrong tree.",

            "review_text": "Most of the reviews you will read will either 'A' complain about server issues or complain about it's the same thing over and over again. While yes those things are true. The server issue only happen at release when NA gamers where allowed to play and was quickly fixed within an hour. The issue of doing the same thing over and over in a game is pretty much any game you play. Now on to the review.     Graphics:    The game looks gorgeous it really showcases what Manhattan would look like during a pandemic. From the Sun Light to the smoke everything looks great. BUT and it is a big BUT. What happen to the graphics we saw back at E3 several years ago? I mean I can honestly say it does look different and I bet a lot of it had to be because of the consoles. Even with the game's graphics not what they were showcased years ago you really need a high powered machine to get everything maxed. With that being said the graphics will not disappoint you trust me, but they are not what was advertised years ago.   9/10    Story:    The story revolves around an outbreak of an unknown virus that has been carried by money and infecting millions and millions of people. You and countless others who call themselves The Division are brought in to help bring peace and order during these times. They did a really good job telling the story of how it all started. Here is where it gets a little bit annoying. They have bits of information and backgrounds that is spread out all through Manhattan. Some of them are portrayed through the actual game world. (I really thought this was pretty cool) Some of the information you have to go into the cumbersome menu (More to that later) and view them but the menu system just leaves frustrated with the menus.(Ex. Scrolling, Multiple Menus to get to one bit of Information.) If you do take the time to go through those issues and read and investigate what is going on it is really decent story.   8/10    Gameplay:   Oh man I am loving the gameplay. Now I really love third person shooters. I also love the cover system in this game. If you hate anyone of those then this game is not for you. You will be going from cover to cover a lot. You will fight the same guys over and over again. Yes at higher difficulties they are bullet sponges. Having to group up on hard missions or even if you go solo is rewarding as hell after you beat that mission and get the loot. This is a loot shooter after all and you will be doing that constantly. The dark zone is where I think the game can shine for some and turn others away. You go to the dark zone to do PVP. In this zone you are not flagged as PVP until you attack another player and once you do you are now considered rouge for a few mins. This is where people will get upset if you are killed due to one of these rouges because when you do die you drop your loot and DZ(Dark Zone Currency) and they can pick it up. This works both ways though and I feel it really brings the game from the standard Capture the flag or death match type that we are all accustomed to. You do not have to do the PVP you can fight regular NPC’s in the Dark Zone. But you still do not know if any other player may want to shoot you in the back while you’re running to that extraction point. The Dark Zone does have limits you have to extract all the loot you get and you have limited inventory space. The extraction points is where the rouge system shines, most the time this is where they decide to cap you in the back while you are trying to extract your loot. Now there are some people who have stated that going rouge is not rewarding due to the death penalty and the rewards not giving you enough to go rouge or losing Dark Zone levels. I feel this can be patched and fixed at some point to make it more rewarding.  8/10    Audio:    Voice Chat enough said, besides that though the game does have great audio as well.     8/10     Final Thoughts:    A lot of people will compare this to Destiny and it has a lot of the same similarities but I played destiny and it was great for the first 20 levels. Then the loot drops stopped and you had to farm engrams or whatever and it was chore. Memories of shooting at a cave for hours. Ughh….. They finally came around and fixed some of those issues. The Division really isn’t the same game though it has the typical loot drops like Borderlands, Diablo and others. To me that it a huge plus. I also feel some of the issue and bugs will be ironed out after a few months or even weeks. As they seem to be fixing some of them as quickly as possible. They are very active in the Steam forums to let us know they are seeing what issues are present. You really need to give this game a shot and I feel you won’t regret it.    Final Score:  9       ",

They can pop out of cover and shoot you (most of the time able to one-shot you) instantly after, without the scope glare showing. The Dark Zone, as well, should have level barriers so people just starting out in the level 10-12 area aren't getting creamed by level 30's.  Graphic Issues: For whatever reason, the game, to me, looks the same on Ultra as it does on Medium graphics settings. Except it costs a lot more resources. I'm not sure if I am just not noticing more detail or what, it is just my opinion.  Gameplay: The basic mechanics work. Not amazing, not horrible.  Overall: I was really looking forward to the game, was in both betas, read every article, saw every trailer.

I will point out the Pros, Cons and conclusion of the game.   Pros: Gameplay wise The Division has fun controls, audio and yes graphics. Cool abilities you can use in the heat of combat. Over 120 weapons to choose from ( some are duplicates with different names on them) while you can customize them the way you always dreamed of . And you can dress to impress.  While you are busy upgrading your base you can always go for crafting if you dont have the cash to buy better gear.  The crafting system is usefull and sometimes you might get something better later on. During main missions you can change difficulty to get more cash and better gear rewards. Co-op mode is fun with friends and random players.   Cons:  Remeber when i said this game feels empty thats because destiny had the same feeling after a few days playing. Empty in the way that nothing is happening while you are going from destination to destination. You only see Npc`s walking around and see enemys looting some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot. Now here is what i think of the infamous Darkzone. I highly reccomend you go there with friends you trust (with your life). There are no friends or partners there, only backstabbing players and PK`s. As a innocent agent going into the unknown for better gear, you will be ♥♥♥♥♥ in there. Its PVP with high risk of losing your best loot.   Conclusion:  The division is not the best game, nor the worst. It does has it ups and downs, you can enjoy it with friends while enjoying the main story missions.  If you are a hardcore COD or Battlefield player, this game is not for you because you will get bored really fast.  If you are a co-op player that just want to enjoy a game with friends i would reccomend this game.  My score for this is 8/10 while i hope the developers can make some improvements ( its ubisoft no high hopes for them)  Enjoy..",

There was too much focus on the graphical quality and environment (Typical for AAA games these days) but the gameplay is just tedious and dull like an mmorpg that is full of repetitive sidequests and clone armies. The story, which seems to be another central focus of the game, would have been ok.... if the script wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing lame and cliche (and not in a comedic way).  I'm pretty sure it's always online, so definitely don't buy if you have ♥♥♥♥ internet. My wireless adapter crashed which caused the game to exit to main menu thus losing all progress on the objective I was completing. Sucks when you get lag spikes in a single player game.  Oh and, did they mess with the cover system, it's bloody clunky as hell - you need a cover prompt to be able to crouch.  This game is just another excuse fo Ubisoft to sell overpriced cosmetic skins and outfits.",

Yes it's like this game, this other game, and that game. IT'S AN RPG (Role-Playing Game, even though there isn't much in here). You can't change it's base what's originally like that. And here's the other thing, Your expectation was too high. way too high.  Now, they promised us next gen graphics, different loot system, locations that are shockingly accurate, etc? YES they did. But did they fill YOUR expectation? most likely not. Do you have to dump them into the abyss of hate? Apparently you do. Yes the dark zone is a terrible PvP idea, it was filled with hackers, haters, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, OP warlords who basically are gangsters in the dark zone even with apparently guardian 2 shooting skills (which mine is, and is decent) can't help in the dark zone. PvE is now the only place to go. Honestly I wished they made a player report system that required a in-game game master. Not that they would do that. Don't hate the game, guys, seriously...

            "review_text": "Pros: Tacticool Diablo, Dark Zone is an interesting premise Cons: Uplay, Ubisoft Servers, Glitches  Everything everyone has said about grindfest is true but I find gameplay to maintain a mechanical entertainment value. If you enjoy it in the first 15 minutes of shoot outs, you'll probably enjoy it. I might get bored and step away from it but I get the feeling I'll be able to return to it and it will be fun again for a while. If you just enjoy using cover movements with teammates to flank enemies and kill them and don't focus on the gear or DZ level grind it is enjoyable. A semi-realistic cover based small squad fightfight shooter with roleplaying game gear boosting and bosses with giant hitpoint bars doesn't make a whole lot of sense but it just has some natural fun to it. Contrary to what some people have said, I've found that using crowd control abilities, focus fire, and flanking on appropriate bad guys is more important than pure gear/level checks on challenge mode.   Uplay is awful and it annoys me that I have it on my computer for this game. In the current incarnation you have to expect to reform a group multiple times to get missions to work correctly. You will lose connection at no fault of your personal ISP at the most inopportune times. You will fall through the world. You will occassionally walk through a wall and make your graphics wig out regardless of your rig's prowess.  I find the Dark Zone's optional PvP to be an interesting social environment in which people hesitate to screw eachother over and have weird codes of honor. It's not all ganking for the lawls and lewtz. I've had rogue agents wait for me to extract gear before they attack me for sport because they want me to get my upgrades. I've been killed and not looted often. I've had groups of agents accidentally shoot me when I'm alone in their area and apologize and not kill me. This kind of neat wild west environment is somewhat ruined by the occassional unkillable/teleporting obvious glitcher but more often than not it's fun. ",

Shooting many mobs and collecting loot. You will do this alot, and along the way, you will find story missions... Just like every other RPG... The story from what i can tell, is basically building a base of operations and restoring order to the city. It all seems to fit together pretty well though.  Think Borderlands, in a more realistic setting, with a PVP area in the middle of the map.   Graphics are gorgeous, the general atmosphere is perfect.

This is much more than a shooter. The only thing that's missing - and I cannot really say that it is missing, but it would've been beyond the scope of the game - is the social aspect, within the game. ie Fallout (1,2,3)  I say, take Fallout series from Bethesta, and give it to Ubisoft, this engine is what Fallout deserves.

In fact the only reason I put it down was due to server going down for a half an hour for work. As soon as it's over you bet I'll be right back in it. Character customization is awesome. Gameplay is like gears but with a more Human feel to it. It is a great game... Don't know why everyone is whining about it. It has been one of the finest gaming experiences I have played in my entire 20some odd years of Gaming. So to the haters. Your Just whining cause the game was buggy on release. I say keep it coming Ubisoft this is one of your greats!!!  Update. After a little over 80 hours of playtime in and still going strong! The collectibles and any left side missions or events should keep you busy for some time after end game. Then.... then you have the dark zone. It is an excellent place to have a good multiplayer experience! There are some jerks who go around killing you for fun, but then you have people that come together and work hard at getting their golden loot and KEEPING IT! Going in solo you will want some pretty strong gear to begin with if you are level 30 as I was.   Now for the down side.... the servers are just not ready yet. Lag, crashing, glitching, and constant server maintenance can be quite frustrating. I am sure they will become less and less of an issue as the game progresses though, just hang in there.

Progression?   Wide Gear and Gun Variety? (I'm a bit of a gun guy and the diversity of weaponry on display is pretty incredible)   Challenging gameplay?   Risk? (The Dark Zone taps into the excitement of DayZ, where pvp is possible and dying constitutes a very real loss that will make you annoyed for about 20 minutes. You *can* lose all the gear you've collected on that specific run into the dark zone, however the loss is not so catastophic that you want to ragequit. Its just enough to keep that zone adrenaline fueled.)   If those things all sound good to you, you will like the game.   However!   There is  one  thing people complain about in this game, and I do give it some validity. Its something you need to be able to get over it in order to enjoy The Division.   This game is a MMO fps, and there are some   boss enemies[/b]  in this game.   These guys take a  lot  of punishment before dying, particularly in the Dark Zone. You, and your team, will have to headshot them multiple times, use multiple grenades, learn to split your forces to hit them in the back while one keeps his attention from behind cover etc in order to take them down, or your whole team will be wiped.  Some people find this silly, and I get it to a  certain extent , because in real life if you shoot someone in the head they are dead. But from a gameplay perspective there is no practical way to impliment challenging bosses in a MMOFPS other than giving them the ability to take a lot of punishment, otherwise every boss would just be dropped from 100 meters out by a guy with a sniper rifle.  It doesn't really bother me, and makes for some really great, challenging fights... but if boss enemies in an otherwise realistic MMO Fps are going to be a dealbreaker for you, then  do not get the game.    But... I can say I have had more fun in the Dark Zone in tense, paranoid interactions with other potentially hostile players than I've had gaming in about 10 years, so if you give this game a miss because of the high hitpoint boss enemies, it would be a shame.  Hope this helps you make up your mind about this game, good luck!  -Wolfsanker ",

Waited on placing a review because the beggining of the game is essentially the beta, and this is the third time i have completed those missions so it was generaly, boring running around completing things that weren't suprising and new at that point. Now i have leveled up pass the beta caps and completed new missions, tested new guns, and gone to the infamous dark zone.   So far so good ! I have not finished the storyline nor reached the level cap or any major plot twists. The perks and skills are extremely interesting and allow for customization based on your prefered role in the game, healing, machinery based attacks or up front with cover and dps. Basically i can see the future of this game being rather fun by testing out different things, but i can also expect people finding the Over Powered combination that may or may not exist we'll see and making the game generic in a sense.   The dark zone is a bit crowded, i have come across some rogues which we took down as a squad and i have also been killed while extracting which sucked ! Unfortunately they uped the levels like crazy in the dark zone, some chest have level 30 DZ requirements and same thing in the shops. some bugs here and there, like floating corpses off the ground or being killed while extracting but instead of dropping loot message of completed extraction pop up at respawn, which was great for me but still technically a bug :P !   I would definitively recomend this game for PC, unfortunately this games minimum requirements is a buffed computer ! personally i run it on low setting :D !

LEL. oh yeah people 60 euros isn't enough you need an other 50 euros to enjoy the game later.  after playing for more then 126hrs I'm fully geared bis and have nothing else to do. It's boring and repatitive..... was fun at first but game died at end game when i realized end game was explotiing bosses such as hornet where you killed the same boss over and over again for high end weps and parts.... really sad really........exploiting is stupid but if 85% of the playerbase is doing it why should you fall behind right in gear?

            "review_text": "Saying The Division is addictive is an understatement, it's one of those games where you say I'll pop on for an hour and the next thing you know 6 hours have whizzed by. Pros and Cons first, then a quick review.  Pros: + Excellent cover system which is easy to use, fluid and works well. Cover is a major part of any engagement in the game. + Combat is excellent, yes it's not a sim and enemies have health bars but this means fire fights can be intense at times. + AI is very well implemented. Enemies use cover well, try and flank you and retreat &amp; regroup for full on attacks. + HUGE selection of weapons, mods, gear, skills and talents to customise you character with. + The city, it's amazingly detailed. A friend of mine who lives in New York was even impressed. + The atmosphere is extremely well done, from the litter strewn streets to over listening to peoples conversations about how they've fallen to a life of crime all adds to a very believable living world. + The graphics, yes there were some 'downgrades' from the E3 demo but most games add all the bells and whistles to E3 tech demos to get the interest built up and then they optimise. But the city looks amazing and the attention to detail is stunning. + Sound is done really well, everything from weather sound fx, npc's talking to each other, distant gun fire echoing through the street to the insults and taunts the enemies throw your way in combat. + Missions can be great fun and challenging especially on hard mode.  Cons: - Some of the side quests/encounters can get repetitive. - Character facial customisation is a little on the weak side and would have liked more options but the gear customising in game makes up for it. - Alot of the gear looks very similar, but as they are based on real world type items I guess one black beanie hat looks like another black beanie hat. - Upgrading the base of operations can be a little grindy with regards to earning the supply points.  Review:  Overall I am really enjoying the game, I played through the open beta and have racked up 7 hours so far in the live game. I read alot of the negative steam reviews about the servers being down on launch but I played for several hours before the servers went down and they weren't down for long. Yes I agree it's annoying when that happens and devs (all devs not just Ubisoft) should learn by now from past releases but giving a game a negative review because of a server crash seems silly to me, a game review should be on the game itself really.  Gameplay is great fun, especially with a few friends. Combat can be intense at times with some firefights lasting alot longer than you first thought they would because of the cover system being used well by both players and AI.  I'm not far enough into the story to comment too much on it, but so far it's fairly interesting.  PVP in the Darkzone is fun, and this is coming from someone who doesn't fully enjoy pvp much. But with the rogue system it makes every encounter with another player in the DZ a careful one, you never know wether you can trust the other person but don't want to be the one to fire first (unless you want to go rogue of course).  Is it the perfect game to end all games, no.... but what game is. What it is however is great fun, and what it sets out to do is done extremely well. I look forward to what Ubisoft brings to the game, especially hoping for more mission types/content with regards to sidequests/encounters.  Overall for me, a 9/10.",

The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the controls are sluggish, it takes half a second for your character to respond to anything; the shooting feels good, until you realize enemies are not dying because your AK is not the right color for it to deal the enough damage so they just take hit after hit and stumble around aimlessly with their pretty poor AI; traversing the terrain is slow and the game has the gall to use the word “parkour” in it for some reason; And all this after playing some of the first missions, which many people say are some of the best. I even think this game could have benefited if it was a single player experience with added co-op instead of it being this crappy pseudo-mmo thing that tries to scream “look how realistic I am” but failing miserably at it.  Hey, at least at this price maybe it’s worth it if you feel like chilling and grinding a bit, I enjoy that sometimes, but not with this game.

Other than that I love this game and is a good shift from the other games Ubisoft has made recently(Farcry Primal and AC), not to mention its blend of MMO features and PVP features. The varing level of dificulties with adding players and playing scenarios with said players making it that much more enjoyable. With that being said the story line, yes is based in fiction and so far is great and like I said it is a good shift from other games made by Ubisoft. As far as the dynamic envionrment destruction as well as the lighting, nothing is perfect and if you arent running the latest hardware and software you need to take that into account and not bash features that you cannot experince nor take for granted.

In my personal taste, it is way better than Diablo3 and it definitely has much more potential than it, but the problem is DEBUGGING skills the Dev's got, and how the company runs this game. Blame Ubi for that.*  [[TL;DR]]: Buy it if you LOVE TPS **AND** DIABLO3 (then this game is perfect masterpiece for you! Don't expect it will be like Path of Exile, it's more like ver1.04 of original Diablo3) or if you think 50 USD(or 90 with DLC) is not a big deal.  Otherwise, wait for discount. Yet this game never worth the full price.  Don't believe those who claims that 1.4 brought LOT of PPL back to the game. Surely some people has returned, but way far less than those who left, and you will basically playing solo unless you got your own group on Discord or whatever. Remeber, this game is ONLINE game.  Current underground DLC never worth its price, so keep that in mind. You wanna wait until more DLC's coming out (which may be next year at least) I am not saying this game is full of ♥♥♥♥, but this game is crap with respect to its price.  At least, Survival seems way better than Underground DLC in my opinion. Just hoping they ACTUALLY fix some of serious glitches they have failed to fix on 1.5. Not sure how many people will still be playing the Division until that day.... It is just like how people left Diablo3 and never came bacck.  -----------------Edited after Survival PTS------------------- Well, Survival DLC is like Zombie mode in CoD. It has (probably) decent rewarding system for those who has lower GS, so they can farm easily without struggling on boring main game contents. However, current state of Survival PTS is not.....that much. Definitely, it's full of systematic glitches (I could not found glitches affecting Survival game play other than trivial glitches Division has born yet), but PTS just launched, so we need to see how it turns out.   My verdict now is, wait until Black Friday discount or wait until the official Survival launching.  It's all about glitches, unstable server status(+gameplay) and lack of contents.  -----------------New review for 1.4--------------------------------  1) Glitches developers insisting fixed are still there + Newly updated glitches! YAY! 2) Game play became less tedious due to lowering difficulties too much which resulted in more boring like Diablo 3. What a miracle! 3) Unstable server status for ONLINE ONLY game. Epic FAIL! They should have made it single player, not like MMO style. 4) Persistent hacks. I mean, cheaters and glitch abusers (since the beginning of this game! )   ------------------------------------------   ----below is not review. Just the worst part on 1.4 and 1.5 PTS personally--- PLEASE STOP NERFING SHOTGUNS. TRY TO FIGURE OUT BALANCING PVP. I have used M870 only on PvE even before 1.4 came out. Gosh see how M870 currently performs worse than Saiga 12 or M4 super 90 on PvE. It may has the highest per shot DMG output, but dam stop nerfing it. Give some thought for close-ranged 870MCS lovers like me (I don't use 870 for PvP because mid-range Saiga12 OP for hunting down the rogues.)",

It takes roughly 15-30 rounds of 9mm para fmj to drop the son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ (just a random mook, not even a boss).  To top it off, the game is linear to the extreme, no random generation here folks. Sandbox? NOPE! I stayed in the same city block for this weekend test. There was constant cycle of death/respawn rinse, repeat. The enemy AI just runs at you and since every resident of NYC except you got a year's supply of PCP, they don't die from a magazine of bullets.  Now, combine all that with no roleplay, ♥♥♥♥ graphics from 2005, and some BS excuse for some MMO features, and I'd rather put my manhood in a blender than play this game again. Good riddance Ubisoft. You make ♥♥♥♥ games just to try to muscle Steam out of the market with your lame Ubisoft launcher.   Garbage, garbage GARBAGE.

That said, this game although it feels very well done and made, theres some glitches and eye sores that you can deal with and minor glitches here and there that shouldve been caught in beta. Although its 60 bucks it just not enough content for the money you pay, and the level grinding from 0-30 max lvl isn't even a grind fest its very achieveable and FUN with friends or random people. The end game content is well made and challenging, even the daily quests for the game are doable much like an MMO, something simple and easy. The only thing that brings this game down a HUGE PEG, is the fact that the PVP and the rate of which people exploit the PVE content is so Ridiculous. PVP is plauged by hackers galore and exploiters, it just ruins the end game experience that people hoped for in this game. Then because of the rate of exploit the Dev Team is punishing everyone with rerolls and such, so we who play without cheating get punished.  END I would still reccomend this game, it definitely blew past my expectations, and set a new bar.  PROS: Fun with friends for PVE and Low level PVP. End game content PVE is Enjoyable with friends, At the core its a great Shooter. Cons: End game PVP is bad, like Taking a VERY DULL knife to a gun fight.",

It took me two tries to get Uplay to login and from there I activated my key. This was around 1 a.m. , an hour after the game launched. My first time loading the game up, I got a black screen. Once I had restarted my PC, it worked fine the second time I launched it. From there, it was quite amazing. The graphics are breathtaking with a silky smooth framerate and very clear fidelity. I really like how the UI works, it's simple and clean. If you read the info, you won't have a problem knowing how to use it. The gunplay feels good, as well. It's similar to Gears of War, minus the heavy feel. I have finished the tutorial in Brooklyn.   So far, the negatives I've found are few. They don't really affect my enjoyment of the game but I'm not a picky guy. The story seems to be basically what you'd expect in this setting, complete with a silent protaganist. Actually, the characters I've met so far don't seem to have much character at all and their voice actors don't seem to have done anything special, either. So, this game's dressings are rather vanilla so far. The enemies seem to be able to take far more bullets than you can but that creates the challenge. Plus, this is an RPG, so you aren't going to be OP at the start.   Overall, The Division has left a very positive first impression on me. The gameplay itself, seems tight and I can feel the loot addiction starting up. A few issues getting it started at first are expected, so that didn't bother me either. To conclude, I am satisfied with this game.",

Verdict: Having bad connection? Wait it out, there'll be fixes... its a new mmo, its going to crash, its going to log out.  PVP in this game is great, its like a light version of dayz, if you complain about balancing issues or how its unfair because people gang up on you, then leave... its the whole point of it, go be casual somewhere else.  I dont know why people hate Ubisoft so much, they are the lesser evil of Activision and EA, as they actually try new ips, if uplay didnt exist, they'd be praised more. Giving this great game a bad review because of that, is stupid... really stupid, do you honestly think it will make a difference to sales? The game was #1 at top sellers for weeks, and the consoles have definitely sold more copies.  Im going to compare this expected to be ♥♥♥♥ing perfect brand new mmo launch day to another,   Diablo III, post update 2014 is a fantastic game, however its launch day was not a launch day, its servers were down for two whole days, yet because Blizzard dont offer a review system on Battlenet, people who actually wanted to play, waited it out... even if there was an option for it, they didnt come onto steam and review the game saying, Its crap because my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet wont allow me to connect.   Im getting dozens of players on multiple instances in The Division on PC... so people are connecting.   Is the game great? Yes, is it a streamlined mmo? Yes, do I care? No.   It has all the good things of an mmo, without the KILL 100 Gremlins for this quest, and the next million quests...   Steam is home to players of all areas, and Ubisoft games target a much larger audience than say, x3 albion prelude, or factorio, whoms players actually have a brain.. The game gets slated for being a Ubisoft product, and because people have ♥♥♥♥ internet/the game servers are down, they give it a bad review. Its their first mmo, its going to have connectivity issues... BUT people, dont care.   9/10 would gang up on people in the dark zone again...",

            "review_text": "As with most Ubisoft games, I fail to see the reason behind the vitriol. I came into  Tom Clancy’s The Division  expecting a solid, open world third-person shooter with light RPG mechanics and some novel online functionality. I have gotten just that. Am I missing something here?  My first impressions: some of the most fluent cover shooting I've experienced since  Spec Ops: The Line  and post-pandemic New York is as beautiful to wander as it is haunting, wonderfully immersive in its appropriate desolation.   The Division  is absolutely gorgeous to look at and surprisingly well-optimized out of the box; one of only three games out of hundreds I've been unable to max out on my current configuration, I average a solid 30 frames with a custom blend ranging between the high and ultra presets which, for me, is both impressive (for a two year-old notebook -- ASUS ROG G750JZ) and appropriate given the technical depth presented here.  Character creation is OKAY. Not good, not bad, but OKAY. It's serviceable. Personally I don't find the player models anywhere near as ugly as people have made them out to be. If anything I find my agent to be rather adorable -- an everyday woman on the job.  The plot is, for the most part, relatively unexplored and welcome territory for the medium. Storytelling, however, has been threadbare, so if that's a personal concern then this may not be the one you're looking for;  The Division  is gameplay-centric to its core. I think most everyone will be impressed by the opening cinematic, though!  Really enjoying the original score, too; the menu and combat themes are perfectly fitting.  There's been much hot air over server issues. Let me put this into perspective: they were back up by the time my preload was finished unpacking, something nearly unprecedented for a game with significant online functionality.  Overall,  Tom Clancy’s The Division  has been a fabulous addition to my Steam library, everything I wanted and then some. Is it a revolution in game design? Hardly, but for those of you with proper expectations in mind, I struggle to think of any genuine alternatives.",

The graphics are amazing till when you come to the enemies; could you not spare some time to add in more variety. Combat in this game was what i expected but not what ubisoft promised about having a dynamic damage system on environment, instead we get a typical shooter. Servers.............. are just typical ubisoft trash servers hosted off Mc Donalds wifi so expect to be kicked from time to time. I was very hyped for this game but now I feel this game was a scam for how little content there really is. All in all this would probably be a great game with friends in the dark zone and if you like to grind but if your more of a story person don't buy this your wasting your money.

Of course the negative reviews now aren't about server issues but tons of other issues, from repetitive content to horribly unbalanced endgame play and hacking. I have to agree with these reviews. I don't regret buying the game, I had fun for the 40+ hours that I played, however I don't see myself ever booting it up again due to the prior mentioned issues. I still recommend the game, just don't expect much life out of it after the main storyline, which is weak story-wise, but still fun to play through. At least for me. ------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW Most of the negative reviews are due to server issues. Fortunately I haven't had issues with that. There have been a couple other bugs I've encountered thus far, including a large section of the ground vanishing, causing me to fall through the map if I tried to go that way. This was fixed by reloading though. Overall no major issues and I'm really enjoying the game. It's similar to Destiny so if you like that and don't mind the shift in theme you'll likely enjoy this as well. If you're worried about server issues just wait a week and I'm sure they'll be ironed out.  I'm sickened by the state devs release games in these days and Ubi dropped the ball here with so many people having issues, however I can only state if I recommend it or not based on *my* personal experience and I haven't had any major issues. So I do.",

Not with ROR alive, anyway :&gt; I wasn't going to buy this game, haven't even heard about it. But here we were raiding bugged as &lt;censored&gt; ops in SWTOR and someone said: 'Hey, we have to wait for 4.3 anyway since many people are going to try on this new MMO'. People kept talking about it and I've decided to give it a try. Side note: I normally don't play shooters (or semi-shooters) at all since I'm very bad at them but some time ago my husband wanted to play GTA 5 with me and I kinda liked it in the end. So I've got this game and been enjoying it so far. Now about what I like and dislike. + Modern and even better post-apocalyptic enviroment (♥♥♥♥ them elfs and magic).  + Running around and doing missions without seeing 3.14 people camping over same boss. But in a while I suppose it may become repetitive and boring.  + Doing hardmode operations solo - nothing like get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by some elite guys with flamethrowers. Although probably people with better aim and/or gear will just breeze through them. + Feeling of the world around you - from graphic design to random things you find like phone recordings, vids, etc. It really puts you there into the dying city and I'm feeling intrigued to know more about the outbreak. + ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!!! Seriously, I love having some place for myself in games even if it's not pretty, moreso if it can be upgraded and developed by you. Ahem, what do they say about women and nests :&gt; + Class trinity. Pretty controversial, this one, but I'm from the crowd that likes it. It's not mandatory to have a healer or a tank in your party, but surely it will help. From what I've seen in skills, you can build support role too! + Easy role switching so i don't have to level an alt to try something different. Also skill development is interesting (not sure I've seen something like that in other games): you unlock them through upgrading your base, rather then simply levelling. Makes sense lore-wise too - I mean if you want better grenade you need better technology. + Fighting style: aiming, rolls, cover. Reminds me of Mass Effect somehow, but then again I haven't seen many shooters before. Now about bad things. - Most important: REGION LOCK and restricted language. Sorry dear Russian voice actors, but my ears are ♥♥♥♥ing bleeding each time I hear NPC's speak. Also yes I get it's New York but it's not Brighton Beach and it feels VERY wrong to play this in Russian. Breaks immersion tremendously :&lt; Yes I get it our version is cheapier but lot of people would gladly pay more for original sound and interface, but guess what? It can't be done with region lock, not legally anyway. I love my country but this is not about that, it's about immersion. - Stability. Actually it's not that big of deal for me since I always have things to do if servers are down, but eh, money are paid and service must be available. - Map design. So, I'm used to those tunnel enviroments where you can go only one way (/target Bioware /wave) but it would be better to have truly open world where you can go into any building and see what's there. Even if there isn't anything significant. Recordings and pictures alone can do the trick if done right. E.g Elite Dangerous planetary landings aren't that great and planets are pretty dull, but it's enough to know you can land on some uncharted world 50.000LY away from home to feel more deep into this endless space. - Character customisation. Ugh. I just say that was the first time I've considered creating male character. First time. Ever. I don't mean there must be some pretty dolls with makeup (there's war going around, eh) but there must be more options. Also female faces look okay in character creator but ingame... (Disgusted noise by Cassandra Pentaghast).  - Endgame. I may be mistaken, but what do you do when you upgraded your base to the max and did all missions for 10+ times and not interested in PvP? Well, we'll see :)  Maybe something more but I'm tired typing :D Would I recommend this game? Yes. If the person has money to spare on probably short-lived fun. If they doesn't or if they want some long-term game to live in? No.",

I fell in love with game i was shown not the one was released.   Game run ok it was entertaining, and i enjoyed it, felt a little flat... the endgame wasn't there. it repair your police station and go pvp. Im tipe of player who enjoys secrets, and woundering around, finding new stuff that wat gets me to play the game and there is supposed to be meny diffrent quests. Truth is I haven't played any DLC.  I really liked and UI was freaking amazing. The best i have seen in long time. The ingame information was so cool.. And the game had easy learning curve. Im fun of execution of 3rd person the way it did.    Now bad stuff. PC INPUT WAS ON POINT WITH THE WITCHER 3... TERRIBLE. The console port for controls was herrendous. something seemed off about key mapping. A bit random.  Alsou pretty revoulting was the face that you nonstop keep getting annoying request to join a groups and/or get random people just to start playing with you.  But i digress - The way it was in trailer made seem like you are in commbat and when chaging perks or what not seemed more tactical on spot decision. While going in UI felt a bit more detaching from game.  Owerall-I love tactical shooters. Game had a good momentom built up before release, and if you have had delivered then Ubisoft would get more money and haven't lost credability (yet again). I loved the game, but lack of exploration, end game, secret thingies, and thease nice touches was what for me was missing. I will compare it to Witcher 3 as it was the best game in reacent years and you should take a look at your self and compare to it. i give the devision 6.5 out of 10.  ",

Normal being like a kill in CS:GO. But despite that, its such a really fun game.",

Obviously with a new release repetitive missions, and modes begin to show their teeth, however the loot system and resource gathering system were botched a few ways which ended up making progression extremely mind numbing, and it seemed that those with the patience to constantly grind had the advantage over any actually ability to get better via skill or thinking.  The match making for the raids was a nightmare, as those who weren't prone to communicating and being social(feels like 80% plus of the game, would rage quit after not showing very much effort to learn the Raid, and try to improve with the people who joined. The game should introduce a mode to train people on tactics, I mean, we are an elite group of 'solider' right, so why not create a game mode where people can earn points during leaderboard ladder systems by actually performing combat strategic activity’s. Like how fast can you get to a location in a room while using cover run. Laying suppressions fire, flanking enemies; you know just something that could help the masses improve within the game.  Anyway, the game is fun until you maxed out what you can do, and then the reward system falls of a cliff, and you will quickly realize that the excitement from doing or gaining minimum upgrades isn't worth the time sink. Some games do a great job of making that task feel almost worth it, however it isn’t up to that level with this title as of yet. Hopefully more content is released, as well as game modes. Not a bad game... just needs to quadruple the content, and add 3-4 more game modes... a few more classes, and reward team play.. And I’ll be back.",

The gameplay is intense, the AI can be easy toward the beginning of the game. Also each mission allows you to recruit players with you and set the AI difficulty. Make no mistake Hard means just that. Mission one on hard was intense. The gas gernades they use are what makes it most difficult. Time your shots and use their gernades against them. There is even the ability to supress the enemy if you play your shots right.  All in all guys yes for a AAA tittle you would think it would not have the issues it does. That is disappointing but at the same time the game is a lot of fun.  Things they could improve other than the obvious.....You can put several rounds into heads and they can keep coming.

I would play it for a couple of hours a week tops, and I'm still playing it now, and enjoying the missions, the gear, the crafting, the guns, the loot system, the grapgics, the sound...heck even the controls are good, and I play it with a joypad. The only issues I had at launch were logging in, and it taking 10mins sometimes to connect, and if you don't connect, you can't play. *NO OFFLINE MODE* it's important you know that no internet means you can't play. Servers go down means you can't play. Not cool. But, that issue has been resolved, and I never have random crashes, and the game runs pretty well. Don't be afraid to run this game on low graphical settings, as it still looks good then. If I were pushed to sum this game up in one sentence, it would be 'Tom Clancy's Destiny'. Good game.",

Talking with friends, strangers, even making new friends. If u have none of the above(like me cause i thought this game was really fun playing solo somewhat lonewolf people would say,,,, then think again , should u buy this or wait for it to update so that the story is more interesting. Lastly, if u really want to buy this game without worrying anything above,,,, then u should just focus on the story mission or side quest first,,, cause unlike me,  I went to the Dark Zone real early cause that is where the fun really starts to kick in,,, but poorly  I hardly can find any players there...  There're always AI enemies and u could just escape them (if you're lucky enough) cause either ur level is too low or you're outnumbered..

Lots of lore. a lot. like i cant stress enough how much. every mission or side op has some sort of lore to it.  i would say it has a the secret world feel without being the secret world. that being said it also has a great atmosphere. they nailed it with that too.  Cons Its mostly snow and contaminated looking areas.  They have a slider that determines how much you stream that part of the world at any given time. they should just make it load the whole or a lot of th3e world and have the rest of the world be on the HDD maxing this slider means long load times for slower internet.

            "review_text": "Unless you have read another one of my posts or comments about this game you have no idea how much The Division has impacted my passion for gaming. The first time that I saw the 2013 E3 trailer I was immediately hooked. When I learned how much attention to detail that Ubisoft was going to put into the PC version of the game I made a decission to quit console gaming and go straight to PC! I built my first gaming rig about 3 months after viewing the E3 trailer and since then I have built 7 more. My most recent being the built specifically for The Division. I have to say that my gaming rig was well worth the money and the time as it runs The Division beautifully at 60+fps in 4K. So for me... The game is exactly everything that Ubisoft promised as far as graphics go. New York is stunning in all of its run down glory!  As far as gameplay goes I can only compare The Division to other similar MMO type games that I have played... Heres the thing... I haven't played any other similar MMO type games. As a matter of fact I have never played any MMO type games as I am not a fan of them... I actually HATE them. When I saw the Division though I felt that it was gonna be different. It seemed like it wasn't gonna have all of that unrealistic bull crap like other MMO games. I decided to follow the game over it's 3 year development to stay keen on what The Division was gonna be about and how it was gonna play. I stuck with Ubisoft durring the 3 years and I liked everything that I saw and read about so when the time came I went on ahead and bought the gold edition with the season pass. This was a big deal to me because I have never bought a season pass for anything... EVER! This was on a game that I have never played before to, so I was taking a huge chance!  I am really glad that I did because I am really liking it. The graphics are spot on, the gun action is spot on and so far the quests have been spot on. The only thing that I am not happy with is the lack of character customization. I don't like looking like several other people and so far I have run into about 15 dopplegangers who look exactly like me... Bummer Dude! Oh, Well! Its ashame that people say that Ubisoft doesn't care. I have 2 friends that work for Ubisoft Mont. and the way they explain it to me is that upper management is pulling their hair out caring so much about this game. According to my buddy Mark the Ubisoft workers that are assigned to work The Division campaign put in at least 70 hours a week 3 weeks out of the month and when they read comments like the ones in this thread it burns them up inside. The 2 people I know that work for Ubisoft didn't work on The Division, but they know people who do and this game is supposed to be the number one priority at Ubisoft. This game is the game that they are banking their future on so I don't understand why they would not care about it.   If you have a really high end gaming rig and you enjoy these type game then I highy recomend that you try The Division out. But please do not just take my opinion as I don't have any other games to compare this to. Do your best to sift through all of the bull $hit hate-mail and find the genuine 'do not recommend' reviews. Also try to find the genuine 'I do recommend' comments. I can tell the real legit comments from the trolls and I am betting that you can to.",

Sure, it's a mild annoyance to be kicked out like that, but it isn't a common issue.   Secondly, yes, the game is very grindy: go to A, kill him, go to B, kill her, and sure, sometimes, the enemies are OP AF and the run between A and B is long, but the visuals are amazing, the streets of this apocalyptic Manhatten. The city has many interiors to enter, places to explore, plenty of missions to keep you going. Mind you, I have't even entered the dark zone!  Now, the movement is a bit clunky, where the cover system is odd at times, and you can't even seem to jump down certain ledges. Main flaw of the game is the navigation of the rooftops: it is very artificial and the route is linear. It doesn't give much freedom for the player to roam the rooftops as they wish, and even jump off to kill themselves.  Now, for the storyline so far is pretty decent, but I really like the game because of it's upgradability for the main base as it gives a clearcut goal, clothings and to go on a hunt for them and the simple fact that it is not a bad freeroam game, as long as you don't go on rooftops, that is.  I highly recommend this game if it were a tad cheap, maybe on Steam sales, although it is not too shabby to buy for £40/$60.",

Dark zone maybe need something more as incentive but it gives good adrenalina and if you play solo asks you to be smart if you wanna extract your loot. Maybe there was too many hype? well never seen a game without Hype and when it is released someone doesn't blame it. This is a good game better than many others around and i think is worth to play.",

After about 90 minutes into the game, it stutters (video and audio) to the point it's almost hung. I've read of a lot of other PC users having the same issues so I tried some of the things they recommended. Even on medium settings it does the same thing. I cannot exit the game...it hangs every time. Ctrl+Alt+Delete won't even work. The only way for me to get out of the game (even when it's not stuttering) is to press the reset button on the computer.   About the gameplay...I found it boring and repetitive. Run here, kill these people. Run there, kill these people. Do it again and again. The AI is smart and will often seek to outflank you. However, it just feels dumbed down when you have to put 30 rounds into someone's head just to kill them. The 'boss fights' are very anti-climatic. The bosses are named versions of the same skinned enemy with a high DPS output and more life.   I've had my eye on this for a while and I'm glad I was able to scratch that itch, however, I'll not be coming back.",

Except much more action, which is awesome! I really loved what time I actually got to 'play' the game.   The gameplay is a heap of fun, and you can easily spend 100-200 hours playing. There is lots to do, with the freedom of open roaming. However, once you hit endgame, there's very little left to do.   Unfortunatly, for a game that is now officially Released, and out of Beta, it has a HUGE amount of technical failures. Crashes, incompatible with leading graphic cards, game bugs/glitches where you get stuck, or don't get the reward from missions or vendors. Lots of graphical malfunctions (most likely due to poor performance optimization).  The PVP is horribly unbalanced, as is the gear aquasition. Hackers and griefers benefit greatly, and easily. Don't even bother entering the Dark Zone (PVP area) without being level 30+ with great gear, you WILL be one-shot constantly by other players.   I also found the Support for the game incredibly lacking. There is no clear/easy way to make a support ticket. The uplay support feature didnt' work for me at all, as the site wouldn't let me enter anything at all in the 'Product' field of the report, and wouldn't let me submit the report without entering something in the Product field. (hence, unable to even file a support ticket).  The game itself is fantastic! Briliant concept, lots of fun. But due to the problems mentioned, I would NOT recommend this game at the moment. I would recommend waiting a few months until they actually FINISH the game, and buy it then. It should never have been released in the state it is, it's still be BETA.",

For my closing the game is repetitive and not really much of a story but the game is beautiful, the loot is lush, and I hope the DLC's offer much more to fill the gaps.  So just be sure to watch videos, and read real reviews to get a idea if this is for you. I ejoy it with friends and not a lone wolf game if you like lone wolf than go for it but it is very hard in Dark Zone or for me atleast.   One more thing if Ubisoft would just pass there ideas for there games to some one with a better dev team than the games would be much better. Just saying.   I forgot one thing, Ubisoft did lie about map size and Micrtransactions for the game. The map is small for and boring. Microtransactions are clothing packs for 5 bucks???!!! dumb to be honest. I would buy clothing packs for 2 bucks or less, would you?... Now they did say the Pay to win would not happen (Buying weapons that are overpowered and so on) But we will see what happens in the future.",

I will keep this sort as possible.  Pros  The graphics is amazing with a lot of detail  The sound was spot on The game play was also great with some really fun fights  The DZ is a nuthouse it's unpredictable and exciting  It's great that you can change you skills during a battle to change tactics Weapon customization is nice  Cons Character creation is very limited (there is a lot of clothing options in game) The story line is a bit dull and the last boss fight felt well like 'was that it?' There is a lot of side side quests but most of them is the same so you will end up feeling bored while doing the missions later on in the game. There is a lack of things to do at max level  If you played the beta then well you basically seen most of the things game have to offer.  Most of the weapons feel the same   At the current price I would not recommend the game to anyone unless you get it at a discount.... that said we don't know what the DLC's will bring to the game but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",

            "review_text": "Tom Clancy's The Division is yet another maths game. It seems to be aimed at male preteens who find it too boring to learn math. The pace of the game is well-balanced, with players solving math problems interspersed with dramatic action scenes.  The protagonist, a very Alec-Baldwin-ny Jack Ryan, is tolerable enough, but the constant application of witty one-liners and the insertion of beautiful female characters into the plot does not a James Bond make. That said, the storywriting is competent enough, but few of the characters seem particularly likeable, and I felt a growing sense of apathy in the game, most noticable by the time I had defused the bomb in the President's briefcase. The main exceptions I can draw here are Mister Glozov, Jack Ryan's witty GRU counterpart, and Madame D'orangé, the scantily-clad dominatrix first seen at the end of 'Part 3'.  Sometimes the action scenes can seem a little jarring, as the scene cuts from dramatic sequences to solving maths problems. Barrelling down the corridors of the Kremlin as explosions crash around you is all well and good, but when a math problem appears mid-sprint in the centre of your screen, it does tend to take the player out of the action. That said, there is still something very satisfying about solving a complex differential equation and seeing the result play out in front of you.  I played this game through by myself, and managed a good twelve hours of gametime. I did not devote too much time to the 'side missions' and 'odd jobs', but I understand that these alone can provide another three-hundred-plus hours of content. You will probably want to undertake these side ops as the game progresses, if only to witness the changes that occur to your home area, the rather blandly-named 'Base Alpha'. While I did not undertake any of the side missions that appeared after 'Act 2', I was particularly happy when the Drama-Cola vending machines appeared, not to mention the Japanese stripper bar.  Oh, sorry. Forget about all that.  This game is actually a multiplayer, third-person shooter with brilliant graphics and MMO elements.",

            "review_text": "Review based upon beta and early launch.  This is an open world RPG shooter, meaning:  Open world: You are free to go where you want on the map, the game is not blocking you from going places that are too deadly. And the map is a large chuck of New York whick is mostly free roam (some areas do requite a load, like the player versus player area). Exploring the map is rewarded with lore e.t.c. While moving about there are random encounters of various kind, these can be ignored or not, depending on what you feel like.  RPG: Your character gains experience points that can be used to improve and acquire various abilities, like healing and using a (physical) riot shield. Loot/rewards are level based, so an improved item may not be useable right away.  Shooter: This is the base game mechanics against enemies, along with grenades and any abilites that have been acquired. It is also covered based, so using cover to advance/retreat to improve survival and supressing of the enemy is an important tactic. The weapons have slots, with options to slot in upgrades (laser sight, larger magazine e.t.c. if you have them) that modifies the stats on them.  The graphics in the game is great and very realistic, the atmosphere of the city is very convincing. However, since they did not do a complete city, parts of it ends somewhat abruptly and can break immersion as it obvious to see where the map ends. The occasional building and underground area does help to make the city feel more real, as well as offer alternative routes to locations.  Character movement feels a bit slugish when moving about and changing directions. Disengaging from cover can bit a bit wonky, as well as using some abilities. Quick double press for the heal abilities rarely worked for me and it switched to the throw version of it, which is not something you want to struggle with during intense battles.  Your base gives access to crafting (remains to be seen if it worth it, given the excelent loot from the PvP area), and new/better abilities when the base is upgraded. Upgrading is done with specific materials, which can be rewards from some missions.  The mission area/encounters design seems rather lazy, in that you either defend against several waves of enemies at a location, and/or go through several areas where one of more waves will appear, often with a boss encounter at the end. To me this is the biggest flaw in the game so far, it is very predicable what and when it will happen, only the number of waves and enemy type is a 'surprise'. Granted it is limited what they can do while keeping it realistic, still gives that part of the game a meh feeling.  tl;dr If you like shooters with some strategy/cover elements and the ability to roam freely in a city, this game might be for you.",

No way to leave the game, no way to quit the game, nothing but to sit there and try to connect over and over again. Now I know what you are thinking 'But Bob Dole you unplugged your internet cable.' Yes for a way for you to see what is like if you can't connect to the servers which currently happens all the time. For example when they have a maintenance on the servers you get that same error message.   Who there thought 'Hey lets go ahead and create an error about you not being able to connect but then give the users no way to exit the game?' The fact that I have had to use alt+f4 or ctrl+alt+del multiple times to close this game is just sad. It's like they hired some guys right out of high school who don't know the first thing about designing software.   Want another example of their poor design? Just look at the interface that they don't explain to you at all. Seriously go to the inventory screen and explain what every single item on that page does, i dare you try. If you did it would probable take a few pages of text because there is too much crap going on the screen.   Now another example of their ♥♥♥♥ poor design is that you can't break down items easily. No see you have to go from one section (say backpacks) and break down those. Then you have to hit esc, select the next catagory and break those items down. So no real easy way to break anything down.   These are just a couple problems that a blind ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkey could spot within 30 seconds of playing this game. Don't waste your money on this thing. I don't care if it's a single peso as that would still be too much money.",

You cannnot no matter what planning ahead you do prevent server slams when millions of people are loading onto then ALL At ONCE.  Some people can not be satisfied no matter what and never pay attention to mininum PC requirements and complain when their 'old' trusty 4 year old PC cant seem to hang with the latest game.  VERY BASIC REVIEW:  Graphics in this game are insane on the highest setting (and even lower settings are nice) My PC is a mid range gaming computer and is playing Divison at a smooth 60 fps. The snow? Collects on you as it falls, the fog can cause you to turn a corner and BOOM right into some bad guys. Its a very pretty game, but you have to have the PC horsepower to see it.  The cover and fire motion is fluid and you must master it to keep from getting shot to pieces. One mission was inside a mall (I played solo) with a tactic of cover and fire and with well placed grenades and the ability to throw out the auto turrent I was able to defeat the mobs along with veteran NPC's and a super bad guy with a flame thrower. It was not a cake walk. NPC's will flank you and others will provide suppressive fire and move on you. The NPC's that charge you are like drug fueled crazy's that will go down easy with head shots but if you get hit POW!  Some missions have a sniper that does crazy damage and you have to fire and move to get closer or pull out your own rifle and reach out and touch them.   Your character can collect and mix and match gear to have his or hers or idenity and stand out from others.   The missions to get a working base up are fun, story driven and make you feel like you have a purpose other than mindlessly just shooting everything. And remember this, you can do whatever you want. Dont feel like doing a mission? Do some quick side missions. Collect intel, phone logs, video logs etc etc etc. I personally like to listen to the phone logs they give a human side story to the pandemic doom. Collect weapon parts, and other material to make some good weapons and gear.  NPC's hang out of windows to praise you and or yell at you. Dont like them? Fire a few rounds and they retreat inside their apartment and turn the lights off lol. I like that kind of detail.  Did I say no loading screens? NONE even in the Dark Zone in and out, nadda, zero, NONE.  The cleaners are literally a blast to destroy. Hit them in their tanks and watch them go boom.   Anyway very basic review but this game is simply just plain old fun for me.",

I would say its hovering on undecided at the moment)  Story so far has not been able to tickle one give a damn. This game does display the Tom Clancy banner, so maybe it is just a slow start.  Combat is okay for what they are trying to do but it just doesnt feel like the right choice for a realistic style of game.  Game has run smooth so far. I did have some textures popping in at one point but my rig is getting a little long in the tooth, so that is on my end not the games.  As of this moment I would say that it feels more like a F2P play than a big AAA title. The game did not carry enough interest for me to stay up late or to get up early and sneak an hour or two in before work. It is a Tom Clancy game so I am hoping that it is just a slow start to a great game.  UPDATE: 50 hours played  Its good for Ubisoft that Mr. Clancy is dead because this games 'story' is a disgrace and a disservice to the man.  If you are looking for a great loot based shooter with a good story, go play Borderlands. If you are looking to play a tedius loot based shooter that will make you cry at the fact that you spent sixty bucks, The Division is the game for you.  R.I.P.

At the time of this review, there are very few people willing to go the PvP route though since the rewards for surviving as rogue are kind of low vs the risk, but it still creates tense moments I have never had in any other open world PvP game.  My group of 3 came across 2 groups of 4 at an extraction area and since mics are all open we started chit chatting with one another, all the while all 3 groups constantly maneuvering around to ensure no one could get the drop on their group then a shot and a grenade out of nowhere. Forty seconds later my group of 3 stands amongst 9 dead agents to loot, come to find that there was 1 guy hiding in a tent that decided to fire into our large group and create some chaos.  I am not saying every time you hop in the game it is like this, but it is still far better than most games similar to it. I certainly enjoyed it more than Destiny as a personal preference. If I had one critizism it would be that is seems low on content so far, but the devs are promising to add a lot more. I hope they come to deliver better than on previous Tom Clancy games.",

If you want a gread story and universe to dive in this isn't the best game for you.  But if you like shooting and the MMO genre it's the game for you. The goal is to play the story and get level 30 after this the online part get's more and more important, the main goal for you is gearing up. To dungeons or Darkzone.(i recommend darkzone because dungeons are to difficult for fresh lvl 30) The concept of the Game is a bit like Diablo 3. You run from Boss to Boss in the Darkzone, and loot everything, and check if it's better than yours and if a legendary weapon dropps (yellow one) and you like it you are very happy.  Grinding for gear is an essance of the Game, to do the challengs dungeons (lvl 30 dungeons in lategame) better and maybe to do some PvP in the Darkzone.  It's like Diablo the game with the loot.  Also the combat system of the game is great for this reason it doesn't get boring for me even after nearly 60 hours of playtimg it makes stil a lot of fun. Every weapons is different and the mods you can equip the weapon makes it better and let it feel better.  So if you like a Game like this buy it, if you need a Game with great Story and no lootgrinding and don't like the online part of the Game than don't buy it because you won't be happy with the Game.

            "review_text": "Easy to describe this game. At the beginning exciting and new, later specially when reaching level 30 everything is boring, nothing to do.   You either collect all the collectables just to get a cosmetic item or you play in the dark zone which you have to put up with people killing you, while your waiting to extract the items which you have just killed a boss to gain and that is the only way you can take out your hard earned loot. If someone kills you they can get your loot.  The bosses are a joke, they have crap load of armour which by the way you seem to have none in comparison again low level npc's. And take far too long to kill they just stand there blasting away without interuption.  Everyone looks the same in this game, you can not make yourself unique.  Weapons are weak.  I have completed the game in 48 hours. Now without friends online there's nothing to do but play it all again. But why? nothing changes you can't play differently.  My advice, don't buy until they increase the maps, if they ever will.  Seriously this is the biggest bag of ♥♥♥♥ there is for a multiplayer game. Save your money spending it on something worth it's money.  In the dark zone and you have collected some loot from the mobs you have to send a flare for extracting your items. But once you have done this you have to wait 90 seconds for the helicopter to appear, then you only have about 20 seconds to hook your items. Doesn't sound bad until you have mobs spawning and coming after you. So either your killed an lose your items or you take on the mobs and time runs out.  Your armour is a joke, I can see why people hack the hell out of this game. Everyone in the DZ is purple and have ♥♥♥♥ loads of armour.  Oh also if you die you lose a rank.",

Still have the same hacker issues but hopefully they address this next. At the very least the game is now solid and enjoyable experience even past lvl 30 just don't get your hopes up for pvp yet.     Edited review 10/8.   PTS is very promsing, I actually was enjoying what I played of the PTS, the changes they are making very well may revive this game and I will edit my review to a positive one upon release of 1.4 provided it's as solid as it is on the PTS!     EDITED REVIEW 06/13.   Quick check list of what they need to fix in this game.    1. Hackers (They finally took a note from Blizzard and claim they will be permabanning first offense now this is the right step but hackers were the number 1 reason this game fell so hard on PC) 2. Exploits (So many, PTR ftw.)  3. Better brackets for dark zone (Getting there!) 4. Stop breaking the game every patch (Seriously stop it, make PTRs) 5. Solo DZ queues because not everyone can gather 4 people up to play together all the time a solo bracket is needed in this game imo. 6. Last thing, your community managers you have doing the state of the game videos are not the right people to be doing these videos..... It would be like putting me up there I would just be a total uncaring ♥♥♥♥ which is essentially what we have now, I remember one of the states of the game early on the Hamish dude talking about how hacking wasn't really a problem right now and people needed to git gud they were getting owned by better and higher geared players but the reality was it was hackers 100% (thousands of youtube videos of proof and you still denied it). No one who is dealing with that wants to hear this kind of garbage in a state of the game. Recruit someone who doesn't have a chip on their shoulder, maybe someone you would view as openly empathetic.",

            "review_text": "First off I'll say I dislike shooters. Most of them are run and gun with no point to it.  The Division was recommended to me by a friend. I got into beta, I had a great time. After beta ended I spent a couple of weeks thinking about it before I pre-ordered.  Don't go into this game thinking it's like Black Ops or any other FPS. It isn't. It's not a blood bath and racking up body count. There is a story. And it is fantastic.   What I Liked:    Graphics where great even on medium.    I am running a nVidia 480, and the game runs well on medium. So optimization! Runs smooth!   The story elements, the echo system is awesome, and you use it to review sites and investigate sites in your side quests.   Once you get to your Base of Operations you start to unlock and upgrade it. It adds a great feeling of atmosphere.   you can specialize for a certain type of play. The are no classes, but you can build your character to play like a medic, sniper, scout, or assault.   I love the weapons system, and the upgrade and customization of it.   other elements like helping out civilians and getting random rewards is great, just adds more feeling of the in-game world.    What I didn't like:     The cleaner faction uses fire element as there primary damage source. I think that fire damage might be a little bit unbalanced, not even a chance to run before you are toast.   in between each objective when you and your squad, or just yourself, are traversing the map. There is very little to do. The bad guys that spawn are rare, and always the exact same.   The cash rewards vs gear and weapon cost is off. I saved all my cash up until level 10. Still couldn't afford a level 10 sniper rfile.   Some people might wonder why I didn't mention bugs or the server downtime on launch day. Simply put, no developer ever has gotten launch day perfect. Even the mighty Blizzards botched almost every Wow expansion release.   I've got around 15hrs total time played. And just one bug. No glitches. No stuck in the terrain.  EDIT: Hit lvl 30. Discovered you are forced into the Dark Zone for the rest of the HE crafted SET (Power ilvl 31). Dropped HE are lvl 30. So the crafted stuff is the endgame stuff, and better. But you forced into PvP (Seal Clubbing) to get it. Everyone @ lvl 30 is thrown together regardless of rank or gear. Rogues don't fight Rogues. Rogues murder players grinding to Rank 50 (yes rank 50) to get the BP's too complete the set that the BoO started. So if you want to be geared for PvE you must endure being merced (Murdered) in PvP. I don't recommend this game. The changes they have made since launch have turned the entire experience Toxic.  EDIT: In 1.4 I returned to the game. I have to say the changes to game have been tremendous. I have been playing for a couple of days and I'm having a great time. I love the changes and additions since March. It took them a while to get there heads out, but its definitely better.",

            "review_text": "As of the time of this review the game has become unplayable. Due to the constant match making bugs (most notably quick finding a group for an activity and the activity will not start), physics system failures (one layer of the world failing to render causing you to fall through the world), and other bugs all end game activities other than the Dark Zone are unplayable. Due to these persistent bugs I was unable to successfully join any daily activities for two days straight). The Dark Zone has turned into a giant gank fest of rogue agents constantly ruining your time in the Dark Zone. Unless you have a complete 4 man team it isn't worth the effort. In short, until this game receives some major fixes don't waste your time or your money. Especially if you are a player that tends to be a loner.  1.1 Update: The developers have not fixed any structural problems with the game but have only introduced more with this update. Due to an exploit that allowed people to speed farm top tier gear a massive balance problem caused by this exploit has made the situation far worse in The Dark Zone. The developers have not taken any definitive action to address the situation other than patching the exploitable bug. The developers are not doing their due diligence in QA and not taking definitive action to clean up their mess.   There are also many positive changes made to the game with 1.1 update. That said due to the lack of due diligence in QA, and allowing exploiters to benefit from their actions with no serious repercussions I still do not recommend this game unless you are willing to put up with a game in this state.  1.4 Update: Massive took the time to clean the game up top to bottom. All end game activities of any kind now reward you with ample opportunities for upgrades. Game balance is much improved. Game stability is much improved. The game has finally turned the corner and is now fun and rewarding to play. The game no longer feels like an unpolished beta product and now feels like a polished release. As a result of all the changes I'm changing my review to a thumbs up.",

The Devs have really put hard work into their game and have answered a lot of compliants. First - The underground is a great expansion as well as releasing Patch 1.4, it gives you a chance to select world tiers to choose how easy or hard you wnat the environment to be. There is a caveat for this though, the lower the world Tier the lower the gear drops are. Underground has decent drops on tier 4 but the gear is mostly garbage less a few gems dropped once in awhile. the main game really has not improved or has new missions in the story, I do like you can fast track to level 30 so you dont have to play all the BS missions that waste time. Hunter missions are nice and require team play which is nice. Now the Darkzone, is one big pile of ♥♥♥♥. Devs have failed to address the same old issues here, aim bots, increased kill rratio for guns and out right cheating is still rampant. although this concept is nice as you battle not only insane NPC's but other players that could turn on you at anytime for your gear. I had this game at not recommeded but now I must say since I have played a few hours I actually recommend it and hope Patch 1.5 brings some players back.",

From the buggy and disorganized release, very few enemy types, poor loot tables, and terrible PvP, to the recent 1.4 patch that fixed the loot tables, balanced and buffed skills, weapons and armor sets, and brought me back to the game!  While 1.4 makes Solo Play not impossible anymore, you would be wise to grab at lease 1 buddy to help you out. The game lacks variety in enemies with a total of 4 factions opposing you. Cleaners (hazmat psychos trying to burn out the infection with flame throwers) Rikers (escaped convicts) LMB (private military contractors) and the gang members looting corpses and stores.  Teamwork and communications are vital in this game as you and your friends buff each other, heal each other, and revive each other constantly! Keep your skills varied among your friends and assign roles as to who does what. A designated medic is always nice, but its also everyone's job.   It may seem weird regular people are sweating numbers as you shoot them, but trust me, its a fun game.

I think some people have a very confused idea about that this game is and hence are giving it negative reviews when it's always been pretty clear it might not be everyones cup of tea,  UPDATED 10/07/2016:  Switched from Recommended to Not Recommened. This game has slowly but surely gotten worse since release. Massive have illustrated time and time again that they simply have no clue whatsoever how to run an online game. The cheating debacle has pretty much killed this game on PC in terms of player numbers while the gameplay balance adjustments and content additions have been woefully inadequate at addressing the severe lack of end-game content. The stingy loot system does little to help in this regard, its focus being forcing the player to grind, grind and grind somemore with little reward.  Really, it's a crying shame. Visually this game features an incredibly beautiful game world that would benefit a great deal from actually being used by the developer. As it stands, the large majority of the game world is dead space that you will visit once or less and one has to wonder what exactly Massive spent their time on with this game. They could have cut the game world size down to a 1/4 of what it is and had more actual content and the game would have been so much better for it.  This is one loot and shoot game that is somehow less than the sum of its parts.  Avoid if possible. If, like me, you were already suckered into the season pass, well, RIP friend.  UPDATED 22/11/2016:  With the changes introduced in patch 1.4 this game has become a lot more fun to play again. Gear drops are vastly less stingy and the time-to-kill on enemies has also dropped a great deal. The question is, is it too late for The Division?",

Did it live up exactly to the hype of the trailer? No. That being said it got really damn close.  There are so many minor things that draw me into this game that aren't even noticed by so many. The way the snow builds on your character when the snowfall gets heavy. The way the explosion and bullet sounds leads you towards combat so well. The audio cues in combat, while they can often be repetitive, actually bring something to the encounter, ex. an Alex saying he's moving forward, or how when you retreat they actually call it out to their buddies so they move forward. I sat in Skype with my friends talking for hours about the minor details that I just love about this game and I could go on for several paragraphs about these little things that make The Division feel alive.  Most people seem to be stuck up on either 'Ew it's Ubisoft and uses UPlay' or how repetitive the content is. While both have some validation because Ubisoft has made some mistakes in the past, and the content can get repetitive, I don't think either are a slight in the context of what we have as the current product. I can't say how much of a hand Ubisoft has had in The Division but Massive has done an amazing job at putting their game together, listening to community feedback and actually taking action on it. We've already seen a few cases of them listening to the community and patching it in the first week. UPlay doesn't really add or detract from the gameplay, so move on.   As for the content being repetitive, it can be. As someone who looked at this as sort of a half step between MMO and single player RPG, it's completely what I expected. Much like Destiny or Diablo or Borderlands, any kind of loot grind game generally seems to stay the same throughout the entire thing. There are variations on the enemies you fight in all of the titles, but overall the gameplay doesn't change and that's exactly the same thing for The Division. There's several different enemy factions which feel pretty unique from each other despite being all human enemies. As well the last boss of the game shakes things up pretty heavily, though it's disapointing it's the only boss like this in the game, from what we've seen from the trailers of the upcoming updates, we'll likely see more of this type of gameplay.  Overall if you enjoy loot driving, MMO style games, it's worth taking a look.",

It is unfortunate as the game seemed to be promising, but I'm afraid I won't be willing to pay more money for content updates. _________________________________________________________________________________ Ok it's not that bad as half of the day 1 reviews have shown. Having been played the open beta it's clear there're more side missions and encounters, and the main storyline definitely has potential. I understand many people found the server issues outrageous but there seem to be no problems as of now. It looks great even on lower settings, and the whole scenery makes the story more immersive. I've played MMO-s before, though ones set in fantasy worlds like WoW or Guild Wars 2. I personally find this 'real life scenario' setting more attractive than those. I believe a lot of effort was put into this game, though they could have recorded more voiceovers. Poor Alex has died countless deaths just under 90 minutes. Hopefully this can be corrected in an upcoming patch. To sum it up I think we should give it time, and let's reassess in a couple of months. For now I feel it's money well spent.",

All this senseless repeating old mission stuff is not fun, and endgame is all about repeating the same dull missions again and again, just to increase some silly numbers a bit. It ruins my motivation to play the game. There is not even a reason to get better gear, the 'challenging' daily missions are so easy that I dont even need to move and still get the rewards. Its only for the stupid kids who wants to shoot other players in the dark zone.  This all feels disproportionate. I dont even know how i can increase my gear score, everything i can buy in any store or craft has lower stats than the things i already carry. And you need to have a specific amount of gear score to start the new incursion. Thats silly!  A specific jacket costs over 200 Phoenix Credits? Why? That is so dumb. Also, its hard to find decent random players, because most are exploiters.  So there is no reason to play this anymore. You just spend a huge amount of time juggling around with stats and other senseless numbers, just to repeat the old missions.  Dont get me wrong, i like to play around with stats, but there is just not enough content to justify it, because its all you are doing in the game, and on a very basic level. In The Secret World you can go crazy with your stats, work on different schemes, combine gear and abilities and you have multiple layers of strategic possibilities. AND there is plenty of content which forces you to use it. And i never repeated a single mission in Secret World.   I dont want another secret world, but please Devs, focus more on story missions and actual gameplay. And ban all the exploiters and cheaters please. I want to give a thumbs up again.",

In all seriousness this game is okay, i feel like it has a medeocre storyline, medeocre characters, it tries to be epic and falls into the cheesy medeocre catagory. They force you to do repetitive side quest in order to level up enough to do the main quest, huge city and they have only the imagination to make maybe 10 differant interriors for shops and such, and recycle them seaveral times in the city. The clothing options may as well not exist as none of the clothing options really look differant enough to matter. As far as gameplay goes, this game is great, however it is harder to play by yourself by design. Worth the buy if your into shooters but its not as good as previous tom clancy games in my opinion. For examlpe blacklist had a far suprior co-op, even if it was just two people. Speaking of multiplayer, the darkzone multiplayer is great, they found a way to balance it perfectly in such a way that makes it actually do able alone without much fear of constantly being killed by rouge (bandit) agents. 8 hours of gameplay streatched into 30.   I give it 7 of 10.",

There will probably be some improvements with future updates, but the base game so far is a blast.  EDIT: At this point, I'm about 50 hours in, Lvl 30 (max) with my darkzone level around lvl 20. The endgame loot system is very deep, and the addition of dailys and challenge mode at endgame makes for endless hours of non-darkzone playtime. The chance of lootdrops along with the Pheonix Credit system and blueprints make the player on the constant lookout for better gear and weapons.

On a side note, playing it on a PC is painful as it feels like a ♥♥♥♥ poor port of a console game that they put PC keyboard controls on as an afterthough. You get these circular menus with no mouse cursor to select, that randomly jump selections as you move your mouse and infuriatingly refuse to accept your inputs.   This entire game is very obvious cash grab by Ubisoft, that it took them over 4 years to make this game is a testament only to laziness and ineptitude.

I especially love the last ticket response I got where you told me to do the same things that are listed in your forums. I mean I would have never coughGooglecough found those troubleshooting ideas on your forums. LAME (will update when Ubi gets their ♥♥♥♥ together)",

Aquireing gear feels more like a chore than something that is fun and engaging. It forces you into a endless cycle of breaking down abundant purples into materials to craft yellows. The level of diversity in the player build system is lacking for an RPG. The game flaunts lots of RPG elements while some how mangaging to punish anybody for wanting to play the game differently.   The game was clearly built with considerable love and effort. But when it came to simple things like content, story telling, voice acting/dialoge it falls very short. This game has so much potential that really should have been taken advantage of. But it feels rushed and incomplete. Nobody should ever buy a game play it a lot, and sit back and realise. Wow I really wish they would hurry up with DLCs and updates. That is not a complete game. That is not worth 60 dollars. To be clear there is no replayability.   There isn't a functioning PvP system that I can get lost in. The rogue system while I enjoy the idea and I think it works reasonably well. Finding a person or a group of people waiting till me and my team have a position of advantage and exicuting that advantage for a swift victory then proceed to run because 20-23 people are now chasing me. That is fun the first few times. But once you have gear with rolls you are happy with. There is no point to continue going rogue or even entering the dark zone.   Challenge modes are a freaking joke. You can run all the challenge modes in sub 30 min in a good group. Anybody who says they are hard are ♥♥♥♥ teir gamers with absoutely 0 hand eye coordination. Bosses are not hard becuase they have cool unique abilities. They are 'hard' because they take 1,000,000 bullets to head instead of 500.

It is a pretty game though, Graphics are certainly Ubisoft's specialty and this game won't disappoint in that regard, It just isn't really the game they advertised or displayed in their E3 Demos. If you are expecting a Rainbow 6 MMO-esque experience you should know that this isn't that at all. For what it is, it's okay though.

            "review_text": "I'm 28 hours in, and have played maybe 1/4 of my time grouped, the rest solo. The game is largely about finding out what the deal is with what is happening, and retaking New York. As such, expect a lot of combat vs thugs, and researching/finding 'clues'. It can seem somewhat repetative, but I found the combat to be fun, and like how the use of cover works in the game. I have had a couple issues where I couldn't seem to get out of cover, but that could have been due to me slamming keys on the keyboard in a panic because I was flanked by a thug.  The AI works the same in most battles, with the exception of a few scripted battles. Essentially the hand to hand guys just rush at you. They don't even try to use cover. (Too bad. They would have been really something if they attempted to use cover to get to you.) The regular mobs tend to move forward, using cover, and engage you. Some of them try to flank. This works well and forces you to maintain situational awareness or you will end up with slugs in your back. The snipers hang back and snipe, which is what you would expect. A little more movement from them to alternate sniping position would be nice as they're easy to pick off at leasure once you kill their friends. The bosses seem to act mostly the same as the regular mobs, making handling them only sleightly harder since they have a ton more HP. Overall, AI is passable, but could be better.  Missions - there's a few different types, but it boils down to 'Conquer', 'Conquer and Hold', 'Investigate the things' or 'Go get/do/push the thing, repeat doing this to the other things nearby'. The different locations help with this, but in a game that is supposed to run several seasons, they had better improve on this somehow or most of us aren't going to go much beyond season 1, if we even go that far.  There are a few different types of weapons in the game, which allow you to tailor your character to your play style which is nice. I usually found I had enough money to buy a couple nice items now and then to fill in the holes. I am running blues with a few greens and things seem to be going well for me. Crafting can also help you fill in a couple holes. Most of my stuff comes from drops though, which is as it should be in my oppinion. Weapons upgrades are nice.  Character advancement is pretty easy and lets you tailor things to your liking. Nothing amazing here, but it works, and stays out of the way when you're busy shooting thugs. By this I mean, it doesn't throw things in the way of combat when you happen to advance something in the middle of combat. It knows you'll get to it later. (It does tell you you leveled, but not in any way that disrupts combat.)  The story is interesting, but the game starts things out feeling high intensity and that every moment counts. Once you get beyond the tutorials you realize there's no real need to hurry, and the story starts to feel like background noise to a fun MMOFPS experience. Would have liked the feeling of intensity and need to have continued.  Graphics are nice. Occasional lighting issues, but they don't happen often. I fell through the world once but was teleported back to base and was able to resume my mission easy enough. At least it handled it gracefully.  UI has a learning curve, but once you figure it out, it works.  I've started playing a bit in the dark zone PVP area. Put bluntly, this area can be brutal. Going at it solo? Plan to die a few times and have some of the stuff you got taken from you. There really should be a way to get the best gear other than going to this area. Uncontrolled PVP means anybody can come up on you and kill you at any time. And they will do this. I've had guys waiting for me to finish my PVE combat so they could hit me after I get my new stuff or when I'm hurt from combat. It's just a really tough place to be, even with friends. Not for the faint of heart. I think they're going to need to make alternate ways of getting the best gear, or make some changes to how the DZ works else it's going to end up the domain of the people who like that sort of thing, and the rest of us will be stuck with mostly blues and greens for gear.  All in all, it's an interesting game with a few problems, but quite a bit of fun. If you liked Borderlands, you'll probably like this game too. I might recommend waiting for a sale to get the base game, but either way it has the potential for hours and hours of entertainment.",

SUGGESTIONS not that they even would read this  why not wondering bosses is that to much to ask how about a little more pheonix coins.. how about randomising the god dam div tec boxes so player more stumble onto them, then they re apear elsewhere rather than farm grinding being the aim of this game.",

It seems like Ubisoft took their money and ran with this IP. I suggest investing your time in other games.   Original Review: Graphics are amazing and game play is i'd say 8/10. It's a typical gear seeking game like Diablo or Boarderlands, so if those types of games aren't your thing then this game isn't for you. The early levels are a bit slow but at this current point in time I'm lvl 20 and things are seeming to pick up quickly as far as enjoyment levels. Be prepared to get frustrated at the 'bullet sponges' that don't play by the rules that you'd expect. Meaning, shooting them with a 100 rounds from an LMG may not stop them, so you will have to use tactics. That said, that is what I like about this game with the risk reward of advancing or adjusting to a scenario can tip the scales. I wish there were more character customizations as far as body appearance (hair, head, eyes, etc.) Though this game needs a few tweaks, it's not enough to get me to not recommend this game.",

There are also so many bugs relating to connection, the quality of servers are intermittent at best, while several of the talents do not even work. In fact, sometimes they are the oppostite. The attitude of Ubisoft and Massive are: close threads down of anyone posting any negative feedback, while communicating the absolute minimum: the silence indicates that this game is in trouble. The fact that vendor blueprints are more exciting that loot drops is alone a sign of a completely broken game.

YOU CAN STILL DOWNLOAD ONE ♥♥♥♥ING .exe FILE AND HACK YOUR GAME AND YOU WILL NEVER GET BANNED. GET IT TOGETHER. rating was 10/10 then 8/10 then 0/10 and now its -999999999999999/10. I want a refund.  --Update-- Got banned for hacking. Finally.",

Other games have made me laugh, feel sad and once even cry, this is the first game that has made me feel depressed after getting told to 'Please, die.' and also playing a mission for about 30minutes before being kicked from the group for no reason other than to be a ♥♥♥♥.  There are too many problems with the both the game and the high end players.  PROS: - The actual gameplay is good fun and intense when played with friends or good online players. - The graphics are impressive, shooting fish tanks sees the water spray out onto the floor. - The mission are varied and good quality - The story is inventive and shown through gameplay not written words.  CONS: - There is way too many loading screens. You join a group you LOAD. You then transfer to the group location LOAD. They then kick you out for no good reason LOAD. Each load is a good 5-15 seconds further slowing the game down. - There is maybe 15 missions you can do, each of them good in itself but there is no variation one run to the next. You know when and where the enemies are going to spawn so you learn the exploits too easy. - There are a large amount of bad players. Not poor players of the game (like me) but just jerks, who will kick you out near the very end of the final boss just so you don't get the bonus. - There are a large amount of bugs in the game itself, the main one being that half the time the missions wont load properly meaning you'll have to quit your gropup and reload. - I have also been abused multiple times for playing to the best of my ability. Even going as far as telling me to simply die. There is no simple way to block/report this behaviour. - There is always people spamming the caht with ads for hacks. You can't read the chat. - There are way to many hackers which make the DZ(PvP area) useless as you can be killed in 5 seconds from 'god-like' cheats.  I want to keep playing but there are too many problems for me to continue.  SCORE 2/5",

I bought the game after 1.4/1.5 updates so I'll give a review from scratch as of the current version, I don't have any experience with the game before these significant updates.  Pro's  - Runs very well in fullscreen (Maxed out-50/60fps w/ R9 390) but it doesn't run well at all in borderless  - Lots of content, in 3 hours of gametime I barely managed to achieve anything because I kept getting distracted  - Great looting system w/ lots of weapons, clothing and other stuff, I just hope it doesn't end up with lots of the same weapons just with higher stats at the end  - The map is decent size as far as I can tell with a few different areas and nice fleshed out interiors without loading screens  - Matchmaking works great  Neutral  - Absolute bullet sponging, if you go after a higher level mission then you're basically playing cookie clicker for a few hours. *Click click click, it's kind of ridiculous. Alternatively play at a slower pace in terms of your level and it won't be as bad.  Con's  - I don't know what's going on with the texture filtering, textures from a certain angle look like PS2 textures and then you move the camera and it's back to current-gen, I am on max settings  - Lots of running  - Some missions are easier in solo, some missions are near impossible in solo, the way they're handling balance scaling is stupid, just alter the amount/accuracy/dps of enemies, you don't need to start changing specific missions &amp; levels or altering health this is simple and really shouldn't be an issue at this point  Summary: This is definitely not a GOTY, it feels a lot like a Borderlands mixed with a Rainbow Six Vegas but given decent circumstances and a fair chance this game could be a lot of fun for you, I'd give it a stronger recommendation for people planning on Co-Op.",

Still I believed it was some kind of MMO without fantasy and without monsters/zombies/aliens. Then I bought it because it was on 50% discount. Well, the game is fun. I do not know about the endgame, I am only 30% through the campaign, but the game is good. It's like Left4Dead meets Diablo. But more tactical. It's basically a co-op game (not an MMO with big scale PvP or PvE), but what it does, it does it perfectly.  The feel of New York in chaos is amazing.

The leveling up to 30 was fantastic but the endgame significantly was tedious and boring. The loot system, the DZ and the 'challenge' were over the top in harshness. In order to get the best gear to complete the hardest stuff, you had to beat the hardest stuff. I like a challenge but when you get one shot by an NPC when it takes a million bullets to do the same.  With 1.4 they have made significant improvements with accessability and time to kill. If you have played this and dropped it, I would recommend picking it up again and seeing if it is worth another shot.",

This review is mostly for players who maybe played at launch and are considering going back, I mostly just talk about the improvements they've made and why they make the game worth coming back, not so much about the game itself for newcomers. I played the game at launch on PS4 and really enjoyed it for a couple of weeks, but once I hit the endgame it quickly felt shallow and got old immediately. Then the first DLC and major patch hit and it became an unplayable mess; the dark zone (the only PvP offering at the time) became a complete waste of time, the first incursion was laughable compared to the destiny style shooter raids they were being compared to, and so many bugs were introduced hackers were everywhere, legit players were getting banned for no reason when ubisoft overcompensated, and for months the only updates were addressing these issues and no balancing or loot tweaks made the endgame any more exciting so there was no reason for me to go back and I figured the game was dead.  I heard the game was picking up steam again after patch 1.4 as I'm sure a lot of people did, and so when Steam had the game free for a weekend I gave it another shot (I wouldn't have paid, but frees free so why not). Well it's hard to really pinpoint what they fixed because it's definitely the same game I played before, but man it was so much more fun than the first time around. Somehow the loot drops feel better without being too saturated with overpowered stuff, the bosses are still bullet spongy as is the style of game, but fights don't feel absurdly long like they did. The bugs are all ironed out (except for a rather annoying one where your character grays out when changing clothes and gear sometimes) and once I hit max level on the new character and hit the endgame again it's definitely noticeable that they've focused heavily on adding and expanding existing endgame content in the first two DLCs and content drops since launch. There are tons of daily and weekly missions or side quests, crafting missions and rewarding log book style rotating quests, seek and destroy bounty missions, and the more difficult incursions they keep adding. They're still nowhere near Destiny's epic raids and certainly not MMO raids, but they're decently difficult without being impossible for a pick up group with no mics. Overall the game feels much more dense when it was very light on content before, and with the bugs and breaks fixed up its become very addicting the last week or so and I can see it keeping me entertained for quite some time not even coutning the multiple DLC drops planned.",

As of its most recent patches, it is now the game it should have been. A gun based diablo with lots of loot, lots of options on how to play, and a devastated but oddly beautiful post viral attack New York.   Gone is the absurd bullet spongeyness of enemies. With the nerfing of their health pools, enemies now do more damage. Side note, thankfully shotgunners are not nearly as potent as they used to be despite this. The changes help in creating an intense fire fights, and a much greater need for strategic use of cover.  Hitting max level is just the start of the ride, now loot drops plentifully, enough to let you try out the different diablo 3 like sets and build differnt kits. Some are still stronger than others, but you have options like never before. A torment like world system that features weekly and daily kill targets atop dungeon like missions, adding more replayability and options for getting better gear.  The survivor DLC, features a fun, roguelike, mission that throws you into a blizzard bound New York. Chosing between either PVE or PVE, you are left scrounging for gear and survival necessities to make it out alive with loot. Granted if you die you still are rewarded, but once you start getting into the dark zone you can find some very nice rewards for your normal game.  This is some strange child between a Rainbow Six styled cover shooter meets an MMO. Fun with friends, a fun co-op fest awaits for those willing to try and brave its waters after its rocky launch.   In its current state, I do reccomend it. Pleasantly surprised by the changes, makes me hope if they carry through with a plan for a sequel, they take these design decisions and improve upon it.",

Only downside was it seemed there weren't many people of lower level around to party with. Most of the players seemed to be higher.",

            "review_text": "After seeing the trailer waited for the game with much anticipation. Finally bought it from the winter sale, full goodies pack. Huge let down, game is fine but constant technical problems and have to use yet another client, the uPlay.  The game disappears in start, the game starts but in windowed mode even though full screen is enabled in the settings, the game starts but crashes during loading the current play, something in the background(uPlay?) crashes and the game freezes, the game crashes on exit.. I mean come on, 100 bucks on retail and you get this?  The loading time is a major hassle and after it has loaded and 'connected' I cross my fingers that it doesn't crash.  Actual gameplay is mostly just running to a checkpoint and shooting constant spawning gangbangers while trying to avoid getting hit, much what I expected but the prospect of exploring New York with amazing graphics makes up a lot. On PC you get to experience deaths due to control issues, many buttons to handle in a fire fight and the stats(health) are displayed so that you have trouble seeing if you are going to die especially if the camera changes stance. You get used to this and it is only a tad annoying. Melee gangbangers will kill you, period, if they come up on you from a dead angle to the camera.  Not being able to play offline is a huge minus. This should be stated in cat size letters on it's own box that you can not in any circumstances play it without an active internet connection. Even though I like that there are random people standing around in the safe zones doing nothing.  I would not pay full price for this game, get it on sale if you can live with the constant crashes, long loading times and the single player is a nono -thing.",
