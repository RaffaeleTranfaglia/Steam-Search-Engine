To play, you must find the butterflies.",

            "review_text": "How do I write a review about a game that was developed in the name of charity and stay objective. It's difficult to say the least, yet I find it difficult to recommend this to anyone unless you want to donate and it's on sale.  First of all, if I had to describe what this was, I would be more likely to call it an interactive art exhibit. The graphics and color choices are gorgeous of course, but all you do is walk on a beach, follow butterflies to items, spin the item until you locate another butterfly, then click on said butterfly, rinse, repeat.  It was designed to be experienced, not played or beaten, and the subject matter is supposed to illicit an emotional response from the user. Unfortunately, I don't think that subject matter was conveyed properly for it's intended results.  Honestly, if it wasn't for the discription on the store page, it would be hard for me discern the message this game is trying to convey. The idea is that each item you locate belonged to a victim of the Japanese Tsunami, however the game gives you no indication of this. After each item is located, the tide goes out a bit to uncover the next, maybe this was an artistic decision on the devloper's part to convey something deep. Locating the lost artifacts pushes the Tsunami back, acknowledging the victim's loss undoes the damage of the Tsunami, something like that? Maybe it's up to the player to discern for themselves how to interpert this. The focus of the game doesn't become clear until you locate the butterfly on the last item, which takes about 10 minutes from starting the game, if that. After which some text appears on the screen explaining the damage the Tsunami had done in Japan, then the credits roll.  I feel terrible about not recommending this game due to the nature of the title. How can you say no when a percentage of the profits go to the Tsunami Relief Fund? I want to make it perfectly clear that I in no way disagree with the game's message, and support the developers for donating to the charity through this title, I just disagree with it's design. The message could have been conveyed in a more understandable and focused way. As I played I knew what this title was trying to do, I just never felt that it accomplished it's task, and that's the only reason I couldn't recommend it.  Let this be a lesson to developers everywhere. Wanting to create a game to help educate the world of a foreign cataclysmic natural disaster, and to donate to a charity, is not enough. That game must be worth the time of the people donating, and more importantly, the game must make it's message clear. Otherwise people who wish to donate can just do it manually through the charity's website.  Thank you Space Budgie for developing this title and choosing to help out of the kindness of your hearts. I'm sure families all over Japan praise your work and thank you for your time. I wish more developers would put their talents to good use by creating things like this in the name of charity. Please don't take the fact that I'm not recommending this game as a personal attack in anyway, or a stance against your message. Don't ever stop creating and helping humanity the best way developers can. Your work is appreciated, maybe even more than you know. However, as a reviewer, I have to be honest, even though in cases like this one, I wish I didn't.  If you wish to donate to the Japanese Tsunami Relief Fund and other charities that the proceeds of this game are going towards without purchasing this game, here are some links.

A typical game review just can't do 9.03m justice because what 9.03m is and what it aims to makes you feel is nothing like a typical game at all. If you understand the context, through its short and unique use of symbolism, 9.03m is probably one of the most touching, real world relatable experiences that I've ever had while playing a game. Calling it a game doesn't even feel apropos. 9.03m is an experience, a touching, beautiful experience that will move you to the core.

It took about 12 minutes to play through and was basically a tribute to the loss brought about by the 2011 Tsunami in Japan. Just a very pretty, contemplative look at the wreckage of such a disaster, provided in minimalist fashion via shadows that dissipate into items on the beach, which in turn represent the people who lost their lives, which in turn become butterflies (in the game anyway) whose souls flitter across the sky. Since all the proceeds from the game go to two specific relief charities, I would consider it to be a good investment, and it is a brief and yet touching game experience.",

            "review_text": "The aim of 9.03m is not to challenge or entertain in the traditional style of a video game, but rather to humanise a tragedy that can seem so distant and hard to comprehend by those not directly affected by it. Set on a tranquil shoreline awash in shades of indigo, you follow small, floating orbs towards shadowy figures of people. But upon reaching them each one disappears in front of you, an echo of a memory of someone that is now lost forever. In their place is left an item for you to examine relating to the person. This is where the real impact is made.  A small snapshot into their life, we're given a tiny glimpse into the things that were important to them in some way, ranging from small, sentimental trinkets, to something of vastly more significance. It may be a mundane thing like a child's ball, or it could be something more profound like an engagement ring, heavy with the weight of all the meaning and potential that surrounds it. This is what personalises the event and the people, makes it more relatable and brings the realisation that these strangers we see on the news that seem a world away from us, were exactly the same as you and I. It brings everything closer, makes it seem more sort of... real in a way, being able to emotionally relate to it more so than we otherwise ever would.  With every object examined, the water recedes further down the shore to reveal a new trail to follow and a new person at the end of it, almost as if the tsunami itself is being pushed back and the very people themselves are being reclaimed by us with each new realisation we have of them. But of course, they're not, another point which I think this makes very well, the sense of loss. When all's said and done this experience should take between ten and fifteen minutes to go through, but even in that short time it still manages to create great impact and thought, and most importantly, empathy, especially by the very end.  50% of the cost of this goes toward Aid For Japan, with all further royalties going towards it once the production cost has been covered. Even if nothing out of the experience itself does anything for you, that small ask should be enough to justify the purchase.",

The soundtrack paired with the monotone color scheme of the game and the bright, full moon are the most captivating features of this experience. As you walk along the beach picking up lost items and clues to the lives that were before the Tsunami urges you to reflect on nature and how it can be indescribably peaceful or mercilessly cruel.   I certainly recommend people try this experience for the money. It might not wow you, but if you're in the mood for something short and meditative to take a break from the onslaught of shooters you've been playing, spend 15 minutes or so in this homage to people and the lives that could have been.",

However, unlike other artistic games, such as Flower for example, this one is very saddening and very much grounded in reality.   Without words it tells you- shows you about the very gloomy fact of reality and it's inevitability of tragedy. Not only that, but it goes about it in a tasteful way. It doesn't need gore or blood, instead it shows you the ghosts of what once had been. And with every passing object you keep wondering the question of 'What's next?'   With every step in the game, with every new thing I found, I felt my heart breaking more and more. Knowing that butterflies (and moths too) were something that had been said to be the spirits of the dead only made me feel both happy and sad at the same time as they lead me to the next one. And the end scene... With all of the people shows just how many can be affected by tragedies such as this, but it's still only a small fraction. And the moment with all of the butterflies simply flying in to the night sky and forming all of those stars I felt was not only the most beautiful moment, but the most breath-taking as well.  I would recommend this game a million times over, though not even that would seem to be enough. It's touching, it's brilliant, it's beautiful- it makes you think.",

The graphics are shoddy, the attempt at gameplay is benign and I have no idea what the hell is going on.  All you do is walk, pick up object, rotate object and watch some words float up on the screen before the trail or fire flies leads you elsewhere. Don't even both free roaming, all you'll get is an endless field of blue. At least Dear Esther had the common decency to avoid clicking on things senselessly. In short: 9.03m looks like an interesting experiment in gameplay with some cool screenshots to win you over. I'm aware this game costs $2 but I don't think the game is worth even that. Edit&gt;&gt; I noticed that all proceeds go to charity so at least I have the knowledge that my money went to a good cause to make me feel a little better... Honestly, just give your money to charity instead of buying this game",

You can either do this and have an extra little graphics demo in your Steam library or donate directly through a website. My thumbs-down is not against donating to the charity - I certainly won't mind if you go against my recommendation to donate. The thumbs-down is to the 'game' itself. According to my time log, it took me .3 hours to finish it, which translates to about 18 minutes. I'd honestly be shocked if it took me more than 5 minutes to clear it. I knew it was not a game in the traditional sense before playing it, but I thought there would be a little more exploring around the world than what there is. Basically, you find the first object, click the butterfly on the object, and the butterfly shows you where the next object is. Repeat about 5 times until the game ends. The graphic style is interesting, reminding me a bit of what Another World/Out of This World would look like in 3D, but they were somewhat blurry on my screen. Maybe it's because I'm the last person on the planet with a 600x800 CRT monitor, and most people won't have that problem? Rating: 1/5",

With only 10-20 minutes (approx) of gameplay you still get the satisfaction and the odd teary-eye.   Since this is in rememberance of the victims of the 2011 tsunami that hit Japan, the feelings gained from it are extremely real. And as I, myself, have been in earthquakes myself (Christchurch 2011 being the biggest and also had victims of close friends and relatives) I relate to this so much and it really hits home (no pun intended)  I highly recommend this game because it's so simple. There are no huge graphics that will take your breath away, no outstanding colours, yet there's this feeling of serenity that other games can't compare to.   Wonderful and beautiful game.  Love and blessings to all victims, families and people who went through that tragic disaster",

If there's a major tragedy happening in some part of the world, everybody likes to watch the news and speak with friends: 'Hey, did you hear the latest about....'. Yet it's in our power to do more than just watch.  9.03m makes you think about lives lost and what that phrase truly means.  Short, powerful and worth everybody's time.",

The only emotion I felt was boredom at the repetitive 'gameplay' and surprise at how short it was. 3) It's badly implemented too: only options are resolution and inverted mouse on/off. I would have liked at least to be able to decide between windowed and fullscreen. And you can't even change options while the game is paused! You have to quit, change the option (I accidentally inverted the mouse) and restart, go through the unskippable intro and start the game from scratch. Given that the whole game takes no more than 12 minutes it is not as much of a problem as I initially thought, though.  Which brings to me to: 4) It doesn't even last 15 minutes, and the most challenging part has been figure out how to climb a rock, solved in 30 seconds.  The only reason I don't regret buying this 'game' is because the money went 100% to charity (hopefully, since I bought the 'game' in 2013, two years after the release).",

If you're not moved to contribute to the cause before playing this game, I can't imagine you'll be moved after. I'll review it as a piece of electronic entertainment.   It's a walking simulator that doesn't let you walk anywhere, but where they want you to go. If you walk beyond their boundaries, the screen starts to darken slowly. If you don't turn back, it's game over, and you have to restart from the beginning. I mean the very beginning. Opening credits, and all. It sends you back to the main menu to start again. That was annoying. The game took about five minutes to play through. My total play time of 28 minutes is due to a game over the first time, then not being able to locate the first 'clue' the second time. Once I found the first 'clue,' the game showed me where to go for the rest, and it was over very quickly. I put 'clue' in quotations because that's what the game calls them, but there's no mystery to solve here. Find the item, click a specific spot on the item, watch an animation, done. You'll do this 4 times then the game is over. You haven't learned anything, you haven't discovered anything new, or made any kind of change to your environment. You look at objects that represent a life once lived then you look at shadows representing the people who lived them. That's all there is to see, and do here. It's not Dear Esther, or any of the other walking sims you may have tried. There's one monochromatic landscape that you can't explore. The music is inoffensive, but dull. The whole experience is dull. Art is subjective, so you may find this a touching tribute, but I didn't find anything particularly sentimental about the experience. Nothing that moved me, personally. Nothing that offers a new perspective on the disaster. Nothing that inspires you to get involved in the cause. It's a good cause, but a bad gaming experience. If I could go back in time, and talk to myself before I bought this game, I'd say, 'Just donate a dollar to the Red Cross, or something. Hell, donate ten. Just don't waste your time with the game. You won't be missing out on anything.'",
