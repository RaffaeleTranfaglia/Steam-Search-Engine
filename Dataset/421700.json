Art style was really cute, BG was amazing, BGM was okay. There’s really not too much to talk about Sakura Santa; it’s fan service mixed with Christmas. If you liked their previous works, you can get this one on sale. My favorite character was Akina, the fox spirit.   Now, I wonder if developers will ever make a “Sakura Halloween” VN. A horror-ecchi kind of a game would be interesting.   6/10.",
