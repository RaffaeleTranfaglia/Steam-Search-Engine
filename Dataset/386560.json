            "review_text": "A bullethell-esque game with ARPG-esque loot.  It's a bit short but it's a hell of a lot of fun. I buy a lot of cheapish games on steam and rarely sink more than an hour into any of them... I played this one through to completion (only took me 5 hours, but they were a very fun 5 hours). I haven't tried survival mode yet but if that's done right I'll definitely sink more into that.  From reading the negative review (someone thinking it's too hard/unfair) it seems that it could take some significantly more than 5 hours to play, but to call any of it unfair is nonsense. I had a few points where I struggled to beat areas but that's because I'd try to tackle the hardest available levels (relative to your current power) most of the time. And after all of that later in the game I figured out a significantly better way to change up my ship that made me much more powerful. Half the game is how you outfit your ship and that part is done well. The menu for it is a little clunky/a bit of a learning curve to navigate through it fluidly but after the slight learning curve it works great.  It's well worth the price. This is only the second game I've bothered to review on steam.  Oh.. and the negative review about controls not being customizable is bull. The customization is simply done part by part in the ship editor (and not some sort of global menu). A global menu for controls would be too limiting.",

            "review_text": "Excuse my crappy english (greetings from germany), but I decide to write in english, to reach a broader audience.  Totaly worth the 9,99€! Building your own ship and destroying everything is so much fun!  And on top of it... it's very beginner-friendly. In most roguelike-games, you die way to fast (and especialy in Shoot-Em-Ups). But here, you can take multiple hits (every ship-part has it's own healthbar), and your ship can also be repaired. And the game comes with a handy tutorial, so you don't get lost at the building screen.  And the last thing that is great: Like in 'Jets'n'Guns', you can sell every part for the exact same price, as you buy that part. So, you can experiement as much as you want.  This is a shining gem on steam, thx for that. :)  Edit: Also some bonus-points for really friendly developers. :D",

            "review_text": "Really wanted this to be a bit more polished than it is, and maybe it's just me, but it falls short for a few simple reasons. The biggest is how you can't save design templates, which can take a long time to get the way you want. If you die, that's it - game over, start from scratch. I've died from some really, really stupid circumstances and buggy physics, too. So what's the point in such a complex customization if you lose your design every time you die? I could see having to save the scrap to remake at least the physical structure in a future run, but anything less I would have assumed would be unthinkable. If this absolutely can't be implemented for whatever strange reason, then there should at LEAST be presets or something equivalent.  I've played Gradius, R-Type, Ikaruga, RayForce, Touhou and on and on since I was a child. I'm not new to the genre. At all. I'm using a controller, and PSR STILL feels like you're an ice cube sliding across a floor also covered in ice, shooting at snowflakes. Difficulty spikes and dips violently - it's either a little too easy or murderously hard (and I've tried several different routes with different difficulties). Blueprints are too random, so you're either OP early on or totally underpowered for the majority of a run. There's a way to die without a run immediately ending, and revert to the previous system you were in to choose a different route, but I have no idea how this is triggered and there's no indication of how to earn 'lives' nor is there a counter of any kind. It happened to me once, and I was totally lost as to how it happened.  Some blueprints are way, way, way too expensive (I've never even seen what the black hole generator looks like, despite being frugal on scrap expenditure) and once you clear the campaign, your save just loads back to the mission before the end - so that masterpiece you've spent all that time building up and tinkering with basically gets shelved. That's no fun at all.  It's an awesome concept. I feel like there was a lot left to experience, but the reward is not commensurate with the investment. The campaign ending is brief but has a shocking and dark twist, hinting at a much deeper universe than we're shown...but there are no achievements or unlocks or anything for clearing it. At all. You would think there would be a NG+ system or something, or maybe a sandbox where you could test wacky builds, but no.  I can only hope some of this stuff comes as DLC. I know I would actually pay for it. For what it is, though, I recommend it just for the Saberhagen-esque experience.",

I'm really enjoying this game, customizing my ships, making it look how I want, be it a simple box or a badass shard of death, it's really fun.  You start off the game with a little ship, it can kill enemies, yeah, doesn't do it as effeciently as it will do later on when you upgrade your weapons *cough cough* Lasers, but you can put more guns on but needs to be balanced out with more Generators so you can quickly regenerate the energy for your weapons, and Capacitors so as to store more energy so you can fire longer before having to stop to let your energy recharge, more powerful weapons generally mean they use more energy, but not always, weapons, depending on their grade, will come with bonuses, like -15% Cost or -10% Energy Conservation, that sort of thing.  The levels themselves can be fairly easy but the bosses are tougher and can take quite a beating, dodge their fire and keep hosing them down with either Bullets, Lasers, Rockets, Plasma doodads or more Exotic weapons, Blackhole Cannons or grab floating Rock or Debris with a Tractor Beam and smash it into them, Rocks and Debris can often do more damage than your own guns, so if you do find some and possibly have a bit of front armour you don't mind getting damaged, shove that garbage in their face for some free damage.  Hooray, you win, well done, now upgrade and win again!",
