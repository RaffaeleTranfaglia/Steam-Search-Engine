Its got everything a rpg should have like: - A open world with, like skyrim guilds to join en other sidequest as you explore - A fun and simple crafting system - Some funny humor and dialog. - Awesome combat, let's you choose what you will become, and you can become alot. Like a mix between a mage and a rogue.  - Some clever bossfights - Lots and lots of loot and dungeons Even the two dlc packs are awesome. But this does have some lame-♥♥♥ fetch this, kill this, retrieve that missions. But most of them are sidequest and can be easly ignored. It takes alot of time to finsh this game and the plentyfull sidequest/guild missions keeps you occupied for some time. So looking for a good action rpg, then picks this game up.",

            "review_text": "First time i played KOA i say to myself : 'Shiiiit it looks like world of warcraft !!!' BUT - With High quality textures - Without the thousands retaaards running around - Art Design :  Todd McFarlane  [en.wikipedia.org]  (co-founder of image comics) - Lead Designer :  Ken Rolston  [en.wikipedia.org]  (game design on morrowind and oblivion) - Game universe and Lore :  R. A. Salvatore   [en.wikipedia.org]  (Forgotten Realms)  Thanks Azura this game got nothin common with the mmo for rude and slow minded kids. It's a very interesting and poetic rpg with dynamic epic fights and an amazingly appealing world.  Pros : + The crafting, skill &amp; respec systems + The main storyline and the sidequests (no feeling like working for fedex) + The Ancient stones spread over the world who tell you a 'faery' tale when you activate them + The Zelda Hommage + It's really beautiful, colorful, not realistic at all, a bit cartoon like, well made + A world handcrafted with love + It's a good port and just for that it's worth to see  Cons :  - Music is not very diversified. - Not a lot of choices to build the face of your character. - Some weapons way too much massive, a bit manga. - It's blurry and pale without a   Sweet FX   [sfx.thelazy.net]  - There are Gnomes, I hate Gnomes. (one of my ex girl friend left me for a gnome)  ==AND THE MORE IMPORTANT FLAW OF THE GAME== - Even in high difficulty the game is cake and it turns quickly really boring.    You must use YSA to fix that===&gt;   HERE  [www.dropbox.com]   Don't use the standalone.exe, make your own choice to fit the game to your wishes For example : I don't use the XP gain reduction cause it's buggy (the shortcuts are shiitty after that) I don't use the health regen and mana regen modifications neither cause it screws some spells I don't use the gold gain reduction cause i love to be rich as a pig BUT except these buggy things it's a MUST HAVE !!!   In conclusion i would say i've been totally charmed by this rpg different from the Elder Scrolls, or the Risen or even the Dragon Age... But like i said it's very appealing, it seems to be a long game and the more i play the more i fall in love.",

For me Skyrim felt like you have no purpose to just wonder around and do a few missions, but Kingdoms of Amalur had more of a feel like - Get mission -&gt; Get lvls -&gt; play side and main missions, this has more of a RPG feel to me (once again this is all personal opinions)  This is a great game.",

One thing you really need to ask yourself before you purchase this game is ' Do I have a lot of time to invest in another long drawn out RPG'. I asked myself that before I bought KoA and just ignored how much time I do actually have to commit.   Though I havn't finished KoA and I bored of it at about the 70 hour mark, I did enjoy the exploration and the way the game felt to play. It's not exactly open world or a sandbox but there is a lot to see, lot's to explore. I found myself swapping out specs because playing the one style got tedious and my time got taken up with a lot of travell.   Otherwise, I'm actually glad a bought this, I may finish it when I have more time, up to the point I've played was enjoyable, just a little burned out. If you do buy this, be prepared to commit with small amounts at a time.     ",

            "review_text": "If you liked Skyrim, Fable and alike this has some elements of those like lock picking, committing crimes,massacring villages,crafting of armor,weapons, potions, and a few other things. Combat is the funnest thing, but it can be kinda repetitive, but still good, and very fluid. Its also open world, so you can explorer wherever. Story is not bad, not the best in my opinion, but not the worst, it just feels a little generic at times, it does have some interesting parts tho. Lots of side quest if your into that stuff. They have a good art style, the world looks beautiful and have a lot of interesting designs to the map, music sounds good, weapons and such look good.   I haven't ran any into any bugs or crashing issues, but that might change or not, plus might crash for you, maybe not. A issue I dislike in the game is the camera, sometimes it doesn't want to zoom in when your surrounded by a million enemies. The skill system, could use a little work for how its presented. Fortunately you can reset your skills. There also a tree system for abilities, might,sorcery and finesse, which determine you're play style. You can mix up points into each one of those, or spend it all in one aspect, like in the borderlands game.  Anyways, its a fun game. You have different play styles, like stealth,range, up close, magic stuff. Things might seem to start slow, but they start to pick up the speed as you progress in the game. Their a lot of story stuff if you're interested in that stuff. Most of all, the combat just fun, mainly brought it for the combat, anyways worth trying out.",

            "review_text": "I've tried several times to get into this game but it just isn't happening.  Pros: Looks gorgeous. Runs smoothly at (or close to) 60 FPS. Colorful, imaginative designs. You can reroll your character on the fly and try out multiple builds on one character. Combat is simple, but not awful. Reminds me of a combination of the good parts of Fable and an Elder Scrolls game. Lots of side quests and dialog options (if you want that). Fast travel AND a decent run speed make exploring not a chore.  Cons: Story is incredibly bland. Yet another 'chosen one with no memories please save the world' snooze-fest. Every quest is a fetch quest or a 'go here and activate 4 different towers and come back, thanks' deal. Random battles, as in enemies will just appear out of nowhere and attack you. That last one would be bad, but there are a lot of enemies that can fly and cast magic, so they spend most of the time hovering just outside your attack range spaming magic blasts. The menus are a slog to get through. Lore books everywhere filled with really boring, needless notes. Some of the worst fantasy names this side of Dungeon Siege 3.  If you can grab the complete edition for ~$5 and you really, really want to play another Elder Scrolls inspired game it's not a bad deal, but be warned that it is aggressivly dull underneath the pretty paintjob.",

            "review_text": "Kingdoms of Amalur sure feels like a refreshing wind after trying out a bunch of different mmorpgs and rpgs.  This game combines the combat of many console-esque titles like God of War and Darksiders, with the lore and rpg-aspect of games like Dragon Age and Vampire the Masquerade (roughly speaking).   Lore  After playing around 12 hours I was feeling fairly immersed in the world of Amalur. Bit for bit you learn more and more about the lore, machinations of the world and all the colourful characters that inhabit it. You can go further by looking for 'lorestones' across maps and reading books/scrolls that will teach you more about the Kingdom of Amalurs history, alas it is not mandatory for those who prefer to avoid lore alltogether and focus on the other aspects of the game. But for those who love lore like me, you'll notice that there has been placed a lot of thought into the this aspect of the game. I'm not aware if it's R.A. Salvatore or someone else who wrote the story, but it seems well thought out in overall.   Size of game-world  The game itself seems to be fairly large - the worldmap is quite grand &amp; you travel between subzones on it. 'Clearing' each area can sometimes take a couple of hours - so this game isn't really lacking content as to say. This game has easily 100+ hours of content to go through.   Quests  Some people voice concern that the game is too 'grindy' and compare it to games like World of Warcraft where you kill x amount of wild boars, and then move on to kill x amount of kobolds, etc. Amalur has these kind of quests too, but they are well mixed among very different and personalized quests which in my opinion makes the former ones bearable to a larger extent.   Visuals  The visuals look good, even if you find odd low-res textures here and there which isn't as bad as it might sound as long as you don't expect ultra setting Skyrim ENB with high res textures-quality. Kingdoms of Amalur can also utilize the ENB-injector technology and give the world a more vivid look which I recommend for everyone who aren't satisfied with the default visuals of the game. You can grab it off the Skyrim Nexus site.   Classes  One of the games absolute strongpoints is the 'class'-system that Kingdom of Amalur has. You have a lot of options to combine and customize your own 'class' - mix and match skills of different kinds. The game has the classic 'Warrior, rogue and sorcerer'-theme, but you can create hybrids of all combinations - and the ability to respecc for a sum of gold gives you a chance to try out different kinds of gameplay without having to create a new character every time.   Combat  The combat is fast paced and fun. You unlock and learn new kinds of attacks and 'combos' as the game progresses and you level up your character. The many kind of enemies and their behaviour means that you can't just spam attacks all the time (if you play on hard-difficulty), but you actually need to stop and block, or dodge attacks to be able to win. Thinking ahead is key, for example when positioning yourself so that all the enemies get in a big line infront of you, prior to using that powerful sword-attack that hits everything in a line up front.   Minor flaws of the game  My only gripe so far with this game has been minor annoyances like the FoV (which you can modify using a widescreen modification - google it!) and things like weapons sheathing too fast, both in and out of combat. I'd like to see more RP-aspects and abilities for the character, but seeing it being a single-player game - it's forgivable. The game is also not open-world, but rather 'instanced'. Still the 'instanced' areas are often pretty large, way larger than what Dragon Age had for instance - thus making it forgivable too.   Conclusion  In overall this game is fairly good if you're looking for decent story, engaging combat and many hours of gameplay. A little polish wouldn't hurt here and there though as I earlier mentioned. Unfortunately since the studio behind this game went into bankruptcy we can't be expecting any more updates, which is sad since the title has potential and I would personally be interested in purchasing a sequel if there ever was one.   Rating  Giving this game a 8 out of 10.",

I waited a Long time to play this game &amp; get a price drop on STEAM compared to retail/Etail editions due to some problems with the dev going under. This game has EVERYTHING i Love in a Arpg, looks great, plays silky smooth (on a old system gtx285/q9550/8gb ram), more then enuff replay value with tonnes of good loot to be found. The game has lots of depth, decisions you make actually make a difference in the game. If you like to explore &amp; want to get everything out of the game be prepared to sink hundreds of hrs into this lovely game. The music &amp; atmosphere help to project you further into this realm of Amalur, it really is a joy just listening &amp; watching all that is going on. Unlock abilities &amp; truelly have a say in what u can craft/disasemble as U lvl Up in the game. Some will say you waste time with side quests but i find it all adds up for those that love to dig deep &amp; explore the world. I love all the abilities this game has, something i just found out today is pickpocketing, i was like DANG, wish i knew that from the start, oh well....i can't read manuals, i just 'GAME'. This game has an artistic feel to some other rpg's i really like like torchlight, some will argue it but each to their own evaluation. For me, i Know a game is Golden when initially i i play it 18hrs+ &amp; can't stop playing it till i finish. This game is possessing me to finish it like the Batman series did, it Truelly is an addictive game.  P.S: BUY this game if u love Arpg's or '1st person view' rpg's in general ! Is it worth FULL PRICE for the base game ? HELL YEAH, is the DLC package worth it ? i don't know but if it's like the base game i say YES. Obviously to those wanting to save $ on a sale of 50% min it's a NO brainer !!!  Another note: the 'Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle' seemed to be WEAK, if you use it right away then it may be 'OK' but if u sit on the fence before using it after many hrs of play it seems like a ripoff. (IMHO) PLEASE DO BUY skills for $ from NPC trainers lvl1-3 Good day &amp; DO pick up this wonderful game, i hope the IP wasn't lost &amp; that there will be another edition, but it seems like that won't be the case:(  WIN 7 64x works without issue on my system !!! specs are: q9550 gtx285 (SLI) Not used 8gb ram 2tb hdd..... 256gb ssd",

The world is large enough that it was occasionally a bother to get from one place to another but for me it adds to the immersion, but not too large that you'll waste all your time wandering it or having to fast travel from one place to the other exclusively.   The writing, quests and options available to you are all well done with relatively few bugs. Only bug I found was a quest where you had to get an item from a character and rather than kill him I stole it, game didn't like that so I killed him, then it didn't count the item in my inventory but I couldn't grab something he didn't have at that point.

Nothing revolutionary but I love how you can fine tune the combat to your style considering I love being a Jack-of-all-Trades player and often times a player is penalized for it.   The world is large enough that it was occasionally a bother to get from one place to another but for me it adds to the immersion, but not too large that you'll waste all your time wandering it or having to fast travel from one place to the other exclusively.   The writing, quests and options available to you are all well done with relatively few bugs. Only bug I found was a quest where you had to get an item from a character and rather than kill him I stole it, game didn't like that so I killed him, then it didn't count the item in my inventory but I couldn't grab something he didn't have at that point. Slightly annoying but if that's the only issue I had I'll give it two big thumbs up.",

It's like someone took the combat from Fable, made it actually good and moderately challenging, and then took the idea of massive open environments to explore, chucked some sick Briton mythology in there for giggles and then wrapped it up with some top tier writing and dialogue. The best way I can think of describing it would be if The Elder Scrolls and Fable had a baby, and it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, with the sick quests of Oblivion and Morrowind combined with the combat style of Fable, but made way deeper and with enemies that aren't completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Basically if you took all the disappointment from Skyrim and Fable 3, and made the opposite.  I mean sure, it ain't Dark Souls if you're looking for something super hard, but many of the fights I've already encountered would wreck you if you did them wrong.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those underrated games that got overshadowed by Skyrim because they came out around the same time, and the company was pretty new and unknown. But there are major differences between Kingdoms and Skyrim most noteably, Kingdoms doesn't freeze, get lost, or crash like Skyrim does, especially the xbox version. HOWEVER this game was made for Windows 7, and the company didn't survive, which stinks btw... so there are crashes on Windows 10. Every time I tried to play this game on W10 it did crash after about 15 minutes of play, and others have said the same...so if you don't run Windows 7...you may want to pass on this one, even though it is a really great game.  Kingdoms is really well written, engaging, and fun to explore. The map is huge, AND most importantly, its easy to follow. There are a lot of cool features like dispel chests which are challenging to unlock but hold a lot of valuable stuff in them. Although learning to open them can be a real pain in the fanny because if you fail, you suffer health loss, but they will still be unlocked. There are chests to find, tons of them...and lore stones that when you find and activate them, they reveal narration of the backstory. There is a lot going for this game, it's visually beautiful, reminiscent of Fable, but also holds its own original story and style, and great music, and so is the voice acting. The combat is fun with lots of weapons, spells, etc, to aid you. But the best feature of this game is the combat because it doesn't require the player to be at a high level before they get powerful weapons and spells. You get that pretty darn early so that is a plus in my book. There are 3 game difficulty levels, and several races to choose and build your character from male and female. Human and other. I have logged about 90 hours on this game (mostly offline not recorded by Steam)... and I still haven't finished everything. There are a ton of side quests but not necessary for leveling up , but can be over-whelming if you start too many at once, which is very easy to do. Basically it is open-world, however the story is linear. The character design and environments were created by Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn) so ...you know it's great. This really is an overlooked game...but it plays very well, and you should check it out IF you run Windows 7.",

            "review_text": "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a colossal and deep RPG with a beautiful atmosphere.  The world you can explore is huge, even though it is parted into many little regions which are designed rather linear. However, this makes it easier to find every quest and not to miss something important. There are tons of caves, cities, castles and forests that are enjoyable to explore. Besides, you can fast-travel to any location you have visited so far, which is a great tool.  There are three skilltrees in which you can invest , you do not have to limit your points to one of them. You can mix them up in any way you want to. You will encounter several fateweavers in the game which can reset your skill points for a bit some money, depending on your level. The level cap in this game is 40.  The story itself is pretty cool and presented very well but gets a bit lengthy towards the end, yet the ending itself is spectacular again. There are several moments where you can influence certain outcomes with your decisions.  There is a extremely large number of available side-quests in this game, I ended up having completed around 300 of them (with both DLC’s). Some of them go with the standard pattern like finding some reagents or killing some mobs while on the other hand there are some pretty big side-quests that bring a little story on their own which are very entertaining to follow.  The game has 3 difficulty-settings and I recommend you to play it on hard since it’s still pretty easy on medium as long as you’re not fighting large groups of enemies, especially towards the end when you got the best kinds of armor and weapons.  There is a variety of different enemies that behave different in battle which leads to entertaining fights. The Gameplay itself is pretty good in my eyes, especially the combats are very dynamic.   The graphics are quite good for early 2012 and the world is designed with a love for detail. You’ll find many different environments that feel alive. The great music of this game strengthens the atmosphere even more.  On the downside, there are some bugs in this game which will never get fixed because the studio that produced this game went bankrupt. However, most of these bugs just make some quest items being stuck in your inventory after you completed the quest or other minor things that one can oversee.  In Amalur, you can acquire various houses in which you can store your items, you can even earn an own arena and a mining company which gain you money over time.  There are various weapon types with different advantages and downsides which brings some additional diversity.  Regarding the DLC’s, I can greatly recommend you “The Legend of Dead Kel” and “Teeth of Naros”, which both have a great storyline and add another big map part to the already huge map each. However, the “Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle” just adds a bit of loot that falls off quite quick and in my opinion is not worth the money.  All in All, I truly recommend giving Kingdoms of Amalur a try, for it a large and beautiful game with a wonderful atmosphere.    P.S.: Sorry for my bad English, it’s not my native language.",

Dont compare it to Skyrim or similar games and you'll be pleased...that is if you like fast paced and intense combat, deep storyline, alchemy, crafting, and great voice acting/diversion.   Has a nice spread of all the RPG elements so your not doing too much of any one thing. Reckoning is simplified in ways that makes it easy to play without getting bogged down by realistic elements such as arrow counts (which I actually like...as in Skyrim), but is very well suited for this type of game. It was designed for simplicity and even though its open world still feels linear, but again..keeps a smooth flow and makes it easy to play without having to over think or worry about getting lost (for example).   All the other reviews are true!...they did wonders for the inventory organization. SO NICE! Very nice story and voice acting...but does tend (for me) to feel like just one task after another, but THATS the game and means MORE XP!   Im not one for flashy combat like in Final Fantasy series, but Reckoning has a fast paced combat tied with awesome cinematics that will surely keep your blood flowing. Breaking down the 3 core rpg classes into warrior, rogue, and mage...you are able to focus on one or multiclass into any combination...and you get bonuses based on your choosing which can change as you do. The addition to a 'power up' state called 'reckoning' is awesome. Once you build this charge you truly do feel like a bada$$ and enemies beware! FUN FUN FUN....going to play it right now...cya!

I played the demo when it was available and on the basis of that pre-purchased the full version. I am not disappointed. It's not Skyrim, but it's got it's own charm, and in some ways I'm enjoying playing this as much as Skyrim. Some of the characters look cartoon like, but the environments are beautifully rendered; not in a realistic way, but with saturated colors which give the game another worldly look . The fighting in my opinion looks better than in Skyrim, with sword fights similar to Prince of Persia or The Witcher. The game is played in third person but that doesn't detract from the game in any way, however I would have liked to have had a choice as sometimes first person is cool and at other times third person. Overall I would say anyone into dungeon type RPG's will love this gorgeous looking game. There's already DLC available for this game.",

The story may seem nonsensical and the facial expressions of the characters may seem wooden, but it's all more than carried by the superb battle system. It is an absolute joy. One of the best non-turn based battle systems I have ever used. Easily on par with Dark/Demon Souls. It's fast paced and fluid. It just feels good. It makes you feel like an utter badass. You are given 3 archetypes to work with: Mage (clear enough), Rogue (bows, daggers, fast stuff, cool assassiny skills) and Might (great swords, hammers, tanky things). You can go solo in any tree or mix between two or even all three. Putting points in trees unlocks tarot cards as you go on that change how your character functions in fights. The 3rd tarot for a Mage/Rogue hybrid for example changes your roll dodge into a teleport and tarots beyond that adds the ability to poison enemies that you teleport through. It's pretty rad.  The game world is also pretty expansive; it'll take you a long time to finish everything. Steam is for some reason saying I've only put 3 hours into the game but I know that I have bare minimum but in 40 hours (lots of airport layovers while travelling) but I'm pretty sure I'm only about halfway through the games content.

It's a pleasant feeling to be surprised these days by a game that seemed to be so resoundingly denounced on release. I highly recommend playing it, even with all its' flaws, because it's fun and familiar.   Let's get the bad out of the way: -The first 30 minutes. It's awkward to control without tweaking because it was absolutely designed to be used with a controller. If you have one, I recommend using it. If not, tinker with sensitivity and hotkeys to make it more playable. The defacto tutorial level is unimpressive, slightly confusing, and rather buggy. It takes you through each class and weapon type but you don't have to commit just yet. At this point it seems to be super linear, on rails type of game but push through to the first village and it opens up. -The camera. It takes getting used to. The third person perspective is unfortunate. While I generally play in third person, not having the option to move the camera is frustrating at times. This is one of the areas where it's design for consoles is very evident. -Vanilla. This isn't really a negative or a positive. It's what you expect from a game like this. Some fetch quests, some kill quests, some steal quests, a few factions and schools to join, and the RPG trinity of classes. Even with some multiclassing, it's still an expected experience class wise.  The Good: -Rich lore. If you didn't know, it is written by RA Salvatore and it shows. Some of the stories feel familiar if you are a fan of his books. One of the first questlines, The House of Ballads, is very interesting and they continue in the vein throughout. -Tons of side quests. You can get lost in sidequests for a few hours with each new area and those discovered in the wild. -Combat seems simple on the surface (and can remain so if you desire) but with multiclassing can become dynamic and engaging. -Crafting! I generally only craft because I have to but this system makes it easy. It is not particularly deep or impressive in it's installation but it is perfect for players like me who don't generally dump a ton of time into it. I like that you can craft usable items at any point no matter the skill level. Strength of weapons or armor are based on components used and NOT player skill. A small but important distiction.  This game is everything you expect from an open world RPG in the Elder Scrolls vein. Why would that be a bad thing? Just because it has been done before doesn't mean it can't be done again and done well. Pick it up and have fun with it, I know I have.",

I honestly should have started playing this sooner.  One design aspect I really enjoyed when starting off is how easily I was able to distract myself early in the game regarding combat and character development. Normally in these types of open RPGs, I tend to get bored early on and rarely get to the part of the game where you actually feel badass and know what you're doing: you have good gear, nice weapons you're glad to have found, some money in the bank, etc. KoA:R lets you play around enough early on with different playstyles so that by the time you find the playstyle that fits you best, you are already well-geared and feel like a power house.  Combat is fluid, the weapons are overall pretty great (although I wish I had more patience for the slower weapons in the game e.g. Greatsword, Hammer, etc.).  There are likely flaws to this game that I haven't mentioned, but currently, I haven't really found anything that would annoy me enough to stop playing mid-session.  PRO-TIP: Play on hard mode!! I started off on Hard and was wondering why some of the enemies were still so easy.

The quest system is solid and will keep you busy for the forseeable future, and the game is brilliantly optimized.  As of writing this review I am not even half way through my first playthrough (finishing the main quest lines in both DLC zones). There are three distinct classes to level in depending on whether you want to be a ranger, who favours bows, a mage, who can summon powerful AoE spells, or the cheapest class I have found, the warrior. You are not limited to one class or the other and can make just about any character you could so desire. but the only way to get the very most powerful perks is to invest all of you skill points in to one skill branch.  The crafting system is solid, allowing you to make your own potions, weapons and armor, as well as gems that infuse your items with other powers (Health or mana regen, poison damage, extra armor). Crafting your own gear is recommended as anything you make with high enough ingredients will out perform any weapon or armor piece found in the world.  The game world itself is huge, and given that your character does not have a mount, you will be walking everywhere (fast travel becomes available after visiting a location). There are many different biomes that you will visit on your journey from lush jungles, to scorched deserts, to damp marshes.  It is true that no game is perfect, and I am quite sad that the developer shut down after this game was released, my personal rating for this game is: Story 7/10 The game starts in a new way to anything I have ever seen before, but still has some cliche moments Gameplay 8/10 The fighting system is a breath of fresh air to me after skyrim, it feels fluid and quick swapping lets you juggle your opponents Graphics 7/10 Don't expect crysis the RPG the game does look a bit cartoony but it earns the high rating because it fits so well with the game Sound 9/10 The ingame soundtrack is beautiful and the little details and subtle sounds bring this game to life, an absolute pleasure with headphones  This has become my favourite RPG in my steam library and I cannot recommend it highly enough, the game might be a bit slow for some people to begin with but after you begin levelling up you choose the pace",

            "review_text": "I purchased Kingdoms of Amalur on Steam as a complete package for $11.99 which included all of the DLC and finished the main story in 53 hours. As with most games I play, I finished all the side quests I came across.   Graphics – Great  I loved the graphics in KOA. There is a strong a vivid use of color and the world is filled with detail. Animations are fluid and my PC never once stuttered the frame rate from a constant 60 fps. The environments could have used a little more variety as by endgame you will grow tired of the same recycled assets.   Music – Fair  The music in KOA is well orchestrated but the songs lack depth and variety. More songs would have been a plus as a large amount of time is spent in each area before going to the next and this can have you listening to the same loop for many hours at a time.   Cinematics – Good  Picture the same dialogue cutscenes as KOTOR or Mass Effect. The dialogue itself is very well written but unlike the Mass Effect series, you may not find yourself delving into the various conversation options. The characters and their backgrounds just weren’t interesting enough for me. The choices during conversations also lacked the Mass Effect style feeling of autonomy. You could make good or evil choices but it never mattered much. “Quick Time” events in combat are a cool sight to see.   Story – Good  As RPGs go, this story is original and kept me interested enough to finish the game to see what happens. I did not grow attached to any of the side characters or find them interesting. This game is really all about you. The main villain(s) were menacing but far from the kind of evil we love to hate.   Control – Great  I had no issues with the controls. They are very simple and easy to learn. The UI was easy enough to use. The awkward camera may startle you at first but you quickly get used to it.   Gameplay – Fair  I played as a melee class so your experience may vary. Combat in the beginning is fun but quickly grows stale. All I really had to do was click mouse 1 until everything died. Even on the hard setting, combat becomes too easy as you gain better weapons and armor. You completely overpower everything and I did not die once the entire game. I also never needed any of the consumable items with the exception of a very rare healing potion.   Content – Good  There is plenty to do here and the game’s zones adjust to your level so you are free to do as little or as much as you want to for side quests. The loot you find is very rewarding in the beginning of the game but by the middle, I was scrapping everything I found for parts. I had over five million gold with nothing to spend it on.   Value – Great  For $12 I had 53 hours of fun. The game is huge and kept me playing until I finished. I did not feel inclined to play through the DLC quest lines. In my opinion, they weren’t worth it.   Recommended – Yes  I recommend this game for the price I paid. In my opinion, this game is worth $20 or less. It is currently $19.99 on Steam without the DLC.",

The skills are fun to explore and satisfying to combine, to find your own playstyle. The quests usually range from killing X to talk to Y and fetch Z. Nothing new here.  The game features a huge map, which is unfortunately not a single map, like in Skyrim,  but large Zones that are connected without a loading screen.   Art style and graphics are very colourful, yet gorgeous, comic-esque.  And although it looks a little like Torchlight, it features rather bloddy finishing combos.   If you are in need of easy action without a deep story KoA might capture you for hours,  until something 'better' comes along.  It's not Skyrim and it does not try to be, but it's also not as mature, deep and tantalizing.",

Secondly, if you're going to buy this game, it goes on sale fairly often so I would suggest waiting for a sale  KoA does a lot of things right but a lot is sincerely average: KoA has the option to completely change your character's style and perks at any point meaning that you can change the type of character you have whenever you want to try something new. This is cool but it made me feel like a second playthrough would be fairly pointless as I have already tried all the character builds in one playthrough. Playing through the whole game the environments are beautiful and varied.  The look of the game is more animated than Skyrim or the Witcher and this gives it a 'friendlier' look, this is either good or bad depending on your preference. The fighting mechanic is fun and fairly reactive, being more like the Witcher than Skyrim. You can dodge and mix spells and abilities seamlessly in with melee or ranged combat.  I found the game too easy, playing the whole thing on hard and never really struggling, eventually you become so powerful that you cannot be beaten and fighting creatures becomes tedious even though the fighting mechanic is fun The main story line is decent and has some originality but is definitely not on the level of the Witcher (but few games are in my opinion) The faction storylines are fun and to the point but fairly predictable But the side quests have some cool little twists and original little stories. The soundtrack is terribly repetitive and NPCs like talking during battles which results in you missing half of what they are saying because the background noise is so loud Some reviewers found the voice acting sketchy but I did not notice any problems There is a lot of lore to be discovered which is nice for people into that and it isn't thrown in your face so you can ignore it if you want Lastly, you can sell any item to any merchant and they all have unlimited funds (because running around trying to sell things in Skyrim is pretty annoying)  Pros: Beautiful environments Great fighting mechanic Lots of lore Decent storyline Recustomising your character at any point  Cons: Too easy (for a Dark Souls person) Predictable  Repetitive soundtrack and some difficulty hearing NPCs explain key story points (which they don't repeat) No point in a second playthrough  So in conclusion KoA is a fun game that I would recommend to any RPG fan, but I personally would not rank it above either Skyrim or the Witcher 2",

Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things. 38 Studios and Big Huge Games have created a world worth saving, and they have given us some pretty damn cool tools with which to get the job done.

The characters are pretty wooden, although they try to add some humor, that said the most humor I have is smashing down anyone, yes you can smash down almost every character. This can detriment the game a little, I smashed some people in a market and missed the chance at an inventory, but at the same time I smashed some blind followers on an island and got good armor.  I found one breaking bug on the Dead Kel DLC, didn't bother me too much cause the game is so fun, also take it of full screen mode but keep the native resolution to reduce the frame rate issues, it doesn't actually take it out of full screen but solves issues.   What I like is that it doesn't try to be realistic or serious, like ahmm, oh no there's a big dragon. You've got dialogue choices where you can belittle characters for taking themselves too seriously, more fun. I have a sword that's bigger than me and ancient frisbies.  As I said it's fun and funny, the beasts look incredible and they're diverse, the combat makes you feel like a megalith, you can become very overpowered very quickly, but you can challenge yourself by resetting your class and reassigning points or mixing your class up.  I really enjoy this game, it's fantasy, colorful, full of loot and funny. It constantly reminds you, that you are in a fantasy world and absolutely rips into it if you want.  I disagree it's anything like an MMORPG, it laughs at itself, it laughs at RPG's and then say's cause it's fun and that's the way it's meant to be.   If you're looking for a game that's bright, energetic, fun and funny, doesn't take itself to seriously, I find that it is a bit like the Borderlands of the fantasy realm with more dialogue choice and I love borderlands.",

However I do understand that this game has its issues and there are far more polished and more sophistcated RPG titles out there. But i blieve the late 38 studios did a great job with this title, with this being its first and now only ever game the company has produced i blieve it deserves the cult status it has slowly achieved. The story, the lore and the characters is were this game really shines, its ingossing and it makes you feel like you are a part of the world, and i am truely hoping that one day a studio, perhaps Obsedian, will save the franchise and make a much wanted sequal.  Now, there are areas that may turn people away, the combat is invigorating at first but quickly becomes quite repedative, and many of the side quests feel like you are just visting the same dungeon and the doing the same objective over and over again. Although if you just stick to the main quest, you shouldnt come across this problem. The crafting system is also very limited and is pretty forgettable with the game's competitors blowing it out of the park. But that said it isn't bad either. With the fast leveling up, it feels like the crafting becomes more of a novelty in the late game.  So in conclusion, 38 studios, now gone will not be forgotten with this hidden gem in Amalur. I blieve the narrative of the game alone is enough to warrent interest from a new studio to give this ip another chance. Over all a good game, with some sub par RPG elements but with an amazing story and lore. Well worth buying during a steam sale.  Score: 7.5",

Each category has a few skills you aquire and upgrade, when you put enough points to a skill you unlock the next tier.  The environment looks amazing and drastically changes depending where you go.

            "review_text": "Summary: This is one of the best purchases I ever made on Steam. I've always enjoyed fantasy RPGs, and this little know game is a solid 5 star gem of one. The game starts with you, the protagonist, waking up in the Well of Souls, a so far unnsuccesful experiment designed to resurrect the dead. Your resurrection has also imbued you with the unique trait that you are free from the concept of fate, to which previously every single person in the world had been. You and your knewfound gifts are then tasked to explore Amalur and take down the Tuatha, an army of evil immortals hell bent on the world domination and your personal demise. Some of the defining features of this game:   Combat: Some of the best combat I've ever experienced in an RPG. Simple enough in concept, its all about timing your clicks and mastering weapon combinations while weaving in spells when necessary. But what makes it awesome is how insanely good it feels. Think Shadow of Mordor, but faster and more epic. Plus there are so many weapons with so many stats that it almost feels like the fantasy version of Borderlands 2.   Upgrade sytem: Brilliant. Instead of forcing you decide to upgrade stats without having any clue what they do only to later have you regret your choices, KOA gives you three different upgrade trees: Might, Sorcery and Finesse. Unlike many RPGs, there is not an optimal way to spend skill points, rather upgrading is more about giving you flexibility in how you want to play. You can go full man mode hammer smashing tank with might, ultmate arcane master, become the deadliest assassin with finesse, or any combination of the three. Points in each tree unlock unique spells, weapon combos or perks that make levelling up fun and impactful. Best of all, at any point in the game you reset all your points and reallocate them however you choose (for some gold).   Story and World Design: Beautiful and original, KOA with leave you breathless at some of the worlds you find yourself in. The map is nearly Skyrim level huge, but also very well varied. There are dark caves, snowy mountains, massive forests, brooding castles, wide plains and many more, all populated with unique monsters, races and quests. You will never feel like the game is too small The characters and voice acting are spot on, if you like immersive RPGs then this one takes the cake. The art design is much more fantastical than many traditional RPGs, but I personally enjoyed it. Oh, and while there is a reasonable amount of walking, there is also a lot to do and see along the way, so I personally didn't feel like I was playing Hiking Simulator/Skyrim.   Main and side quests. With 60+ hours on this game as of this review, I have only just beaten the main quests, one faction quest (probably about a solid 10 hours itself) and a handful of side quests. This game has soooooo much to do that I'm not sure I'll ever get to it all. Oh, and I haven't even bought any of the DLC.   The only real flaw in this game is that it is pretty easy. Dying doesn't punish you at all if you save properly, and gold is so plentiful that after a point I never had less than 20 or so potions in my inventory, meaning as long as you restock enough you really shouldn't ever die. Even for your first time I would reccomend playing on hard difficulty.   Conclusion: A beautiful story, fun class/upgrade system and an immersive world collide to create this action RPG masterpiece. This was one of the few single player games that I found myself able to enjoy for hours upon nonstop hours. And for 20 bucks full price, I can't think of a better value on Steam right now.",

World is very interesting yet main storyline seems like 'I did that few times already'. I mean, for example, Fae (naming them just Amalur`s Elves does not give justice to their concept) and their life cycle. How they preserve history and traditions by repeating battles and happenings from long gone past, making them to reappear in endless cycle. Unable to reach for something new. Great and tragic at the same time. House of Ballads storyline is extraordinary. While main quest, tho has its moments, drives us to meat final Great Evil like so many before. Don`t get me wrong - it`s fine but nothing as extraordinary as some other parts of the game. I like fighting system. Played melee fighter. You can really create Your own style. And while most enemies can hit hard at the beginning of the game, all of them can be killed. When I died it was always because of my own fault. Problem is, later on there are no real challenges. The only achievement I didn`t get through normal playthrough was the one to kill enemy 4 levels higher then me. Thanks to scalling system I haven`t found one. On the other hand main hero is somewhat unique figure in the world of Amalur so maybe it was intended by devs to make god-like impression. Can`t say something about magic - haven`t been using that at all. I really liked minigames of picking locks and dispelling. Crafting is very usefull tho crafted items make game even more easy. So up to after Mel Senshir I used Alchemy to craft potions only. Then I made final tier crafts and my charactered trippeled its stats. So whoever wishes to make game more of a .... hmm no, not challenge.... rather more humanlike - do not craft. Whoever wishes to become one man army+++ please do. To sum up. I spend with this game 190 hours and I`m not masochist. So it means i like it pretty much. For World created, for Lore (mostly unused), for Fae storyline, for Dead Kel, for fighting. for many small things making it great rpg experience.

The last 20 hours I was done with the game, I skipped everything that was related to an achievement or the main story and just slammed it home.  Pros Story is really good Combat is pretty fun but there isn't a lot of variability. 5 or 6 moves per weapon.  Cons I played on hard and the game was really easy. You will fight the same enemies all game. A lot of quests and items of note in the game are complete rips off of other games but only done half way.",

Fully voiced, lots of lore, decent story, quests occasionally have options to alter the outcome, graphics are crisp, animations are mostly clean, there's detail in level design, lootz, crafting (optional) and a 'double layered' level up system (able to tech into multiple trees and choose one passive perk). In a nutshell it's a dungeon crawler in 3rd person instead of top-down.  Perhaps my favorite part about Amalur aside from above is the feeling of not being tethered to the game in order to notice progression. I can play for just 15 minutes and actually accomplish something.  On a minor negative note, Amalur does not give the full freedom other games allow. The player can not jump and the player can not decide to step off a cliff on whim; there are set locations to allow dropping into water or down a cliff-side. Fortunately these limitations do not or hinder gameplay.  Combat is straight forward and fairly rewarding. Left click to continue swinging, instill a pause or hold the click to start a special attack. The player can also mix in magic or swap weapons on the fly to make some interesting combos and setups. Though combat may seem too basic the AI does its job in finding those holes in defenses and can manage to really take a chunk of health. While left clicking is easy, positioning amongst groups of enemies is where the player needs to maintain control even though the AI isn't the smartest.  I would recommend Amalur to anybody who likes leveling up and combining classes. The game actually feels like a dungeon crawler but from a behind the shoulder perspective.  I would also highly recommend downloading the YSA mod which balances the game to make Hard mode actually hard and Normal not such an cakewalk.  Additional Thought: It would be nice if Amalur was coop multiplayer though it does a great job as a singleplayer game. If War in the North mixed with Amalur...",

Up: - A big, open world with plenty to explore and varriang landscapes (lush forests, dry deserts, damp swamps, etc.) - Really intuitive active combat it has some elements of darksiders and devil may cry (you can change between main and secondary weapons on the fly, use magic and can string together long combos *although therefore I recommend playing with a controller) - Quiet unique main story and setting (you are being killed and revived and therefore being able to change fate itself and later you also get information about your past before you were killed) - Crafting system (you can salvage any weapon/armor, except legendary and sets and get parts to craft your own weapon/armor and name it) - Dialogue system (sometimes you are able to persuade people, if your skill is high enough and therefore avoid some encounters)   Down: - Tasks, secondary quest are pretty boring (many fetch and kill-x-of those quests) - Crafting system somewhat unbalanced (mid-to-late game if you craft your own equipment you will be pretty overpowered and will kill most enemys with one hit)  - All in all a little bit to easy espacially some boss battles which therefore were pretty anticlimatic xD (minigames to pick locks is pretty easy even with few points in lockpicking *although the dispelling mini game can go eat it man, even with maximum level I still have problems but maybe it's because I suck at those things xD) - Graphics are average there are some good designed places, but other than that not really outstanding (and little variety in the faces, you will meet a lot of siblings but who knows maybe the genetic pool in Amalur is not really varied, that would explain the almost lack of facial animations espacially the main character which looks as emotional as a wet stone ;D ) - Some bugs and exploits (due to the developer going out of business :( ) - Best played with a controller  All in all it's a decent game, it's a real shame the developers went out of business before they could patch out all the bugs but you still get get enough entertainment if you go into it without expecting the next RPG-Hit.",

I wish more RPGs could be as well thought out and beautiful as this one.  For a single playthrough to experience a near full clear will take well over 100 hours, and that does not even touch the DLC. At $40, this is an RPG YOU HAVE TO TRY.

            "review_text": "Bought this on a whim despite many reviews stating it being too run of the mill, generic and feeling like a singleplayer mmoprg- namely Warcraft.  Never played Warcraft so i cant accurately confirm or deny that. Similar graphic style i guess but when i think mamapugu i think boring samey quests and doing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over. Sure at the core it all boils down to 'get thing/kill thing' but that applies to Skyrim, the de facto gauge of this type of game aswell. How the writing packages it counts and in that regard Amalur does a good enough job, the reasoning to get/kill is always nicely integrated into the current setting - there are 'kill ten rats' quests but theyre by far not the majority. They had a writer on board and it shows altho he prolly didnt do stuff for every single miniquest  Regarding map design and such its all well done. The overworld is pretty big and varied, dungeons and interiors are made of prefab parts however its not that glaringly obvious.  It has an interesting weapon/armor crafting system in that you can break down stuff you find or buy into components with different attributes like health regen, resistances, more damage and such - the higher the skill the more components you can add which is really cool and fun but also broken but more of that later. Theres also alchemy which kinda works the same way.  Theres a class system in that you can invest in skills divided into three branches (worrior, stealthy dagger/arrow wuss and magix) and at a certain amount of points in a branch you can unlock specialization bonuses.  Melee combat is pretty fun. Each hit you take makes you reel regardless of actual damage. Sounds annoying and normally would be but that way you actually have to use dodging and blocking and be wary of positioning especially with multiple enemies - the whole thing avoids being a buttonmasher. Theres also combos and parries.   Its a very stable and bug free game, the downsides are all in the gameplay mechanics. First and foremost its way on the easy side mainly because it seemed to be balanced around a player type which doesnt like to do lotsa quests and craft his own stuff and mainly just rushes thru the main quest line - in a sandboxy rpg. If you explore youll be overleveled and if you craft your own stuff it will prolly be at least double as powerful as anything you find or buy.  Hard difficulty doesnt help with that, enemies take longer to kill but arent really a threath either with very few exeptions since if you play at least remotely smart youll have tons of potions or health regen from crafted equipment to negate the higher damage.  As mentioned the fun melee combat saves it somewhat since you cant be asleep at the wheel. Im not a fan of Oblivion style autobalance - if you use all the options in an rpg smartly you should get powerful, its just in this case its too easy to get there. I suppose you could gimp yourself by not using available options and try and keep the game balanced that way but what fun is that.  Another negative could possibly be that the melee combat is fun but not so the magic. There is a move list where you can see all the attacks and there seem to be like one direct damage spell, a heal, summon, shield and a teleport instead of dodge. They can be upgraded in functionality and i havent dipped into that branch at all so i might be wrong how it actually plays but it seems very barebone by comparision.  In conclusion its a very solid, well made and definitely fun game, however it doesnt exist in a game void and despite it not doing anything wrong really it has to measure itself against the towering giant that is Skyrim and thats a lost fight. So yeah if youre really sick of Skyrim but want to play something similar give this a spin - if not play Skyrim :d",

But, what I can say here, is that for years I've been looking for a game that's centered primarily, if not wholly, around Celtic mythology, rather than generic European medieval fantasy or feudal Asian mythology. This game delivered, moreso than I could have ever thought a game could. Why there haven't been more games featuring such strong Celtic themes is beyond me, but Kingdoms of Amalur: Recokoning showed that it can be done, and done very well. I was definitely impressed with the story of the game.  As far as gameplay, things were pretty good. Combat and controls felt better with a gamepad than mouse and keyboard, but that's never been a dealbreaker for me. I feel there could have been more done with combos and chaining attacks, because combat felt a little static after awhile, but it wasn't awful. Most quests(but not all; here's looking at you, Til's Collection) were interesting and often felt like an interesting task, rather than a chore to do for XP. The main quest line especially was fun, interesting, and kept me pulled in to the game. Factions you could join in the game I felt were pretty mediocre, and are your generic warriors, mages, and rogues factions. Their quests were fun, but I never really felt like my character truely belonged to the faction upon joining. The one major downside I felt in the game was gear drops. Almost always, what you can craft at each level was better than anything you could find, even rare named pieces or sets. As for the DLC, Teeth of Narros had a fun main story line, but for the most part it felt drawn out and monotonous. The side quests were pretty boring, and involved a lot of backtracking. Legend of Dead Kell was much better, and felt more involved.  One more note: This game is LONG. And I really mean long, especially if you are a completionist and want to do all of the side quests.",

But the timing was not right.  It seemed unfinished with only one model for each weapon type and barely any difference in armour.  The combat was interesting with different specialised weapons to use with each class. The action bar worked especially well for it. The main mechanic that the combat was all based around was a sort of slow mo that seems to make you do extra damage whilst giving you the ability to do very impressive final hits or death blows. The class systems truly do make a difference and seem to be the biggest decision you will make in the game. The special attacks and weapons were the high point as well as the blends of the difference classes. (I played a Rogue/Mage)  The world reminded me a lot of the original Fable with the same reputation system and choice system. But your decisions didnt really feel like they were making a difference... Except for maybe a few larger points.  The artwork once again reminded me of Fable but the render distance for me was an issue. The world was always fun to explore with secrets hidden everywhere and new towns and houses to explore.   The questing was good and it didnt make you feel like you were grinding like some other RPGs. There are hundreds of side quests to spend your time on until you decide whether you want to buy the DLC or not.  Overall I loved this game even though it had its issues..  If it had a little more time and maybe more funding? It could of been amazing but this is where it was at, I have heard that modding the game can fix a lot of the issues I had with it such as the weapon models.  I rate it a 7/10",

If you took fable (without all the fun) and it had sex with the Elder Scrolls Wiki, this is what you would have.  This is far from a bad game! It is fun to be way overpowered (I played as a mage) and right from the gate you obliterate enemies left right and centre. This is good! It is exactly what I wanted from a game like this. It played well, smoothly and looks great in a very stylised fashion. What I didn't expect however is how DEEP and STEEPED this game is in lore. I can honestly say 90% of my play time (no joke) is reading and remembering characters/NPC's. I thought this was a little strange until I found out that Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning was originally intended as an MMO (something that I feel would have made for a totally different review!) and it changed how I played the game after that. I absorbed as much of the story as I needed and moved on in proper MMO style (and boy was I happier for it!) but it made for a hollow experience as it is (literally!) an MMO world and Lore with no other players...  So what do I think of this? Your experience will vary. It is a fun but very lonely experience with a ton of very cool story that you can delve as deep into as you like. Is it tedious? Yes. Is it huge? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Was it designed for single players? Not really.",

So you have the potential to change the course of history. Its a pretty good excuse for a chosen one scenario. This ties into a card mechanic that shows up when you level and accomplish certain milestones. It also gives a good excuse for how you can re-shuffle your stats. Then everything goes downhill.   There's still bugs, particularly when you try to remap your keys and a few crash to desktops, but that isn't the games greatest sin. Neither is the hideous menu system (which in turn makes crafting annoying at best). The worst part? In short, the game just becomes so boring. It became boring surprisingly early. It is a chore just to want to finish it. This is a direct result of the heavy investment in sidequests and how travel works. I've spent the majority of my 40+ hours just running from place to place for quests. Running from place to place is boring. Running in a linear dungeon with the same tedious fights that are always resolved in the same manner because of a lack of needed for any real tactics and a surprising lack in variety of gameplay is also very boring.

Gameplay, too, is much like Fable - there is some room for character development and loot progression, but it's mostly an action romp. If one chooses to do all the optional quests (many of which are rather boring), the game is fairly lengthy - I clocked more than 40 hours when I came to a game-breaking bug. Which brings me to my biggest complaint - no game of this depth and length should ever be released without some sort of dev console. At the point that I encountered my glitch, the only option was to revert to a saved game some 30 hours prior. Unacceptable. If it weren't for the bug, which I understand not everyone experiences, I would rate this game very highly. As it stands, I'm just not sure.",

You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition.

The Dead-Kel expansion was what stopped me. After defeating him, my companion spawned dead next to him, and remained dead when escaping the tunnel where there are 2 cave-ins which the companion gets teleported imbetween before coming to a dead-end beach. The idea is, your companion will be teleported to that spot so they don't get too far behind and will follow you onto the beach where you will be teleported out after speaking with them. Sadly, if your companion is dead, and you don't have multiple save spots, your game simply ends here. If your companion is stuck but alive, there's an exploit you can do which will cause it to get 'un-stuck' and you can hopefully continue with your game.   The game is insanely easy, even on Hard difficulty. Once you get a set-piece with +1hp regen, you'll almost never need to use a potion ever again.

I played at least eighty or more hours on the Origins version back when the game first game out. KoA:R is one of my all time favorite games, also one of the biggest disappointments to me as well in a lot of ways because I had such high hopes on the IP reallly going places and it's offspring becoming a contendter for WoW. Too bad that never happend, however that still doesn't stop the game from being a great RPG by it's own right.  Since I upgraded my main gaming rig to Windows 10 I found that my big screen TV seems to play better with my HDMI out on my laptop now so I decided to fire up KoA:R that I had on Steam and use it to as a gauge big screen preformance. Once of the problems I had with the PC version of KoA:R was FOV settings and luckily playing it on the big screen helps resolve a lot of those problems.    Game wise the game still is a beautiful game. Yes it has that WoW-like comic book feel to it, but I enjoy it personally over the more realistic Elder Scrolls artwork. No the combat isn't as good as TES and yes considering the writers involved the writing is a letdown but still the game is fun for what it is. It is a great lay back on the sofa / gaming chair and just goof off type of third person action RPG. It is overshadowed by other RPGs and yes it failed to live up to the hype and it was done in by legal issues but still years later it is a fun game by its own right.  It didn't reinvent the wheel, nor did it change the gaming landscape like I had hoped but still years later it is worth playing. It has me hooked again after a few hours now that I want to do another play though and see what look nooks and crannies I might have missed. All in all I still recommend it. I would recommend it though only on sale, and personally only on sale on Steam. I wouldn't pick it up on Origins.",

Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to 'jump' down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go.   Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)  Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this ♥♥♥♥ right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.  Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.  This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better.

But the difference is: To play this game feels more like work than fun to me. I know, the points I'll criticize are very subjective, but that's the thing with critics, so no offense to the ones who love this game, it just doesn't seem to be my style. ;)  Story/Quests:  Ähem. First a confession: I didn't finish it. Yeah. Sorry. It was just not interesting enough. There are epic bossfights, a very, very evil overlord, a war and you as - of course - the chosen one. At least everything you need for a high-fantasy RPG. NPC's are exchangeable all over the place, I cannot even remember a single name. Much less their background.  The main Quests are okay, the 'guild'-Quests also, the rest is too often just filler (Kill X to get Y and bring it to Z), nothing memorable.  World/Graphic: It's colorful. Very colorful. So colorful that I cannot take this game as serious as it wants to be. All this quirky, comic-like fairy-stuff... I mean, even the supposed 'Dark' areas are kinda sweet!  The Graphics themselves are okay, not state of the art, but it's a game from 2012, so - oh, wait... 2012? ... Yeah, they could have done it better then. But it's still not 'bad', just 'okay'.  The map is gigantic and you are free to walk where you want. Unless you walk against a rock. Or against any other obstacle on your path. Even if it's just waist-high. And that upsets me every time in every game! But the music is lovely!   Fighting/Level System: The Action is nice, there are a lot of cool moves you can do, some really powerful spells and techniques. All combined, it makes quite fun to slay all that monsters. And if you are as bored as me by the story (but still not bored enough to quit yet), you might also regard the looting and levelling as your last source of long-term motivation. Also the game has a cool crafting-system, it's diversive and sometimes useful at the same time!  RPG really is my genre of choice, but it seems that I'm not a colorful, very-high-fantasy kind of player... I really gave it many chances to thrill me, but the atmosphere, the story, the character - all that failed to thrill me.",

Unfortunately, this game plays more like an MMO, which is to say there is far more content than you can hope to complete before you become over-leveled.  This also means, however, that you often can't tell the difference between a quickie one-shot quest that takes ten minutes to complete and a six-part branching quest chain that ends in a fantastic and unique reward you'll be grateful to have.  Play the game through with a guide if you want to get the most bang for your buck. Otherwise, play it casually.

Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to 'jump' down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go.   Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)  Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this ♥♥♥♥ right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.  Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.  This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better.

            "review_text": "First off let me start off by stating that my hours played on Steam doesn't represent my hours played in KoA:R by a long shot. I played at least eighty or more hours on the Origins version back when the game first game out. KoA:R is one of my all time favorite games, also one of the biggest disappointments to me as well in a lot of ways because I had such high hopes on the IP reallly going places and it's offspring becoming a contendter for WoW. Too bad that never happend, however that still doesn't stop the game from being a great RPG by it's own right.  Since I upgraded my main gaming rig to Windows 10 I found that my big screen TV seems to play better with my HDMI out on my laptop now so I decided to fire up KoA:R that I had on Steam and use it to as a gauge big screen preformance. Once of the problems I had with the PC version of KoA:R was FOV settings and luckily playing it on the big screen helps resolve a lot of those problems.    Game wise the game still is a beautiful game. Yes it has that WoW-like comic book feel to it, but I enjoy it personally over the more realistic Elder Scrolls artwork. No the combat isn't as good as TES and yes considering the writers involved the writing is a letdown but still the game is fun for what it is. It is a great lay back on the sofa / gaming chair and just goof off type of third person action RPG. It is overshadowed by other RPGs and yes it failed to live up to the hype and it was done in by legal issues but still years later it is a fun game by its own right.  It didn't reinvent the wheel, nor did it change the gaming landscape like I had hoped but still years later it is worth playing. It has me hooked again after a few hours now that I want to do another play though and see what look nooks and crannies I might have missed. All in all I still recommend it. I would recommend it though only on sale, and personally only on sale on Steam. I wouldn't pick it up on Origins.",

It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over. It must have been very expensive to put this thing together.   Combat system is solid, you have to actively move around dodge or parry/block incoming attacks. There are 9 type of weapons and each type lets you perform different moves.  You can develope your character in 3 main ways (destinies). Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen cliché, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra).

Travelling, fighting, looting and mini games all are just not done well compared to many other games.  The fighting is way too easy to be any sort of fun and when your character is hit you stagger which interrupts any sort of flow. If an enemy does manage to hurt you, instant use health potions make it impossible to ever die in this game. Enemies popping out of the ground constantly is annoying and you may quickly find you get sick of it all and just run past as much as you possibly can. If you ever get into a tough fight, you have an *I win* slow-mo mode that also gives you bonus XP for using.  The looting is crazy, with chests littered all over the place. You'll quickly fill your backpack with loads of vendor trash to accumulate useless gold with. On top of that your armor takes damage for no apparant reason so you will have to go back to town to get repairs.  Inventory management is a pain with the massive piles of loot you get, which isn't helped by the fact that there are a billion different slight variations of potions you'll never use because the fights are so easy. Also many quest items are bugged and will permanently suck up your inventory space, yuck.  The minigames are just dumb time wasters. There are two to unlock chests, the lockpicking mostly is just holding a key down and waiting as the default position will unlock a chest most of the time. The dispelling of a chest is slightly more interesting but quickly becomes tiresome on the far far too common chests.  Outside of the main quest line and faction quests, which are good, there isn't a lot of variety with most being go to spot X on the map and kill a bunch of things and come back. The pirate DLC quest series is a standout and if you do decide to get this game (don't) and make it to Rathir then pick up the 'Legend' DLC as it is as good if not better than the main game.  This could have been a pretty awesome game with some tweaking but the good bits are buried under way too much tiresome muck you need to shovel through.",

However, I'm four hours into the game and still don't feel that compelled to keep playing it.  Here are the reasons I don't really like the game: 1. The voice acting is pretty bad 2. I find the main story and the characters boring 3. Gameplay has been laughably easy so far 4. It doesn't compare favourably to Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights, Divinity etc. - just so many elements that are not as good. It doesn't have the atmosphere of a lot of these games.  I've pretty much given up on it, which is a shame as it was £20.",

The skills allow you to fully customize your character into three different skill trees and get special bonuses depending on how you do it. You can also respec as many times as you like(with ample coin).  However, this game has some glaring problems. For one, the game is plagued by copious bugs. It is very frustrating to have to reload the game once or twice an hour because you get stuck in a loading screen, or stuck in the floor, or because the game just feels like randomly crashing. The game also has a strange and clunky cheap feeling to it. The cities are filled with guards who have strange psychic powers and can sense wrong doing from half a mile away. You're allowed to play good or evil and make choices in a Mass Effect like style. This is fun until you realize that your choices really don't matter much. You can go into a town and kill everyone, but that just means you killed a bunch of quest givers, so there really isn't a point. It feels like EA put a lot of effort into making the expansions and just left the bugs, because fixing bugs doesn't make money.  Overall this was an okay game and I recommend it if you'd like a nice time sink, can get it cheap, and can overlook the cheap design and buggy gameplay.",

I finally downloaded it several months later but once I started playing, I didn't stop for almost three months. EA, 38 Studios and Big Huge Games collaborate to create one the most creative, immersive and playable open-world RPGS I have encountered. Heralded as surpassing Elder Scrolls: Skyrim in depth of character, plot and combat dynamics from several sources, Kingdoms of Amalur was an absolute joy to work through. The world draws you in with all its vibrant textures and colors, begging you to explore more as you discover literature, warring factions, strange creatures and races, exotic locations and an enormous list of armor, weapons, and accessories. The fantasy world that you enter in to is overflowing with side quests and locations to explore in its massive scape. Gameplay is unique and intuitive enough that it never became old. Each weapons handles differently and takes time and experience to fully master. Colors and textures pop from the screen giving this RPG unique and warm feel as the environment comes alive in front of you. Side quests are diverse; allowing you to grasp the expanse of Amalur as you explore hillsides, desert, forrest, islands or plunder caves, dungeons and castles in search of better equipment. You become attached to your character, the weapons you forge for him/her and gradually become invested in their success as the story deepens and eventually unfolds into a fantastic tale set in a magical world. After logging over a hundred hours in this game and working my through every section and sidequest; I can say that I was left feeling extremely satisfied and pleased with this work as a whole. The story is masterfully written and gameplay is fun and intuitive. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fantasy rpg with a intricate story that they would like to sink a considerable amount of time into, experiencing all that Amalur has to offer. -10/10",

The combat is smooth and entertaining and the attention to detail in the world is enough to keep you interested during the 35 or so hour gamelength. While there are hundreds of quests, and the game could probably be played for 70-80 hours, I recommend playing this as a story driven RPG. Focus on the main quest and the extremely entertaining faction quests, and the game never skips a beat. However, if you decide to tackle the 100 or so side quests, you will open a pandora's box of issues. For one, most of the side quests are generic. Thats not to say they are not well made, just that they are not anything beyond 'go here, kill this/find that, return'. On top of this, you can quickly over-level. There are ways to avoid over-leveling, but the easiest is to simply limit the number of side quests you do. If you take all of this into account, you'll find that Kingdoms of Amalur is a fun, well made RPG that has plenty of story and gameplay content.",

You have a choice between the classic 3 classes; Mage, Rogue or Warrior. Which you can change between throughout the game by respeccing if you want.  The story is overall pretty bad, and i didn't really care about it that much. i mostly skipped all dialogue and just went on with bashing stuff and getting loot.  The leveling is fun, with levels being gained pretty quick, and new fun abilities being unlocked. You can stack up different types of damage to become rather overpowered in the end, which for me is fun.  The loot is great, and every pack of mobs tend to drop an item or two. But there is a problem of carrying it all. Some items are bugged so you can't remove them from your bags etc. so you end up with less space than you want all the time. You start out with room for 60 items i believe, and can buy bags so you can carry 110 or so by the end. The loot you don't use can be sold or salvaged for materials to craft new items.  The crafting is fun, you can combine professions to create really overpowered armor by the end if you find the correct materials. These crafted armors are much better than what you can find even as rare or 'epic' items in the game. depending on level of course.  Overall: Get the game if you want a fun RPG with many hours of dungeon crawling, looting, leveling etc.",

By utilizing Ken Rolston (formerly of Bethesda Softworks) the team crafted a world where your side quests feel like your helping people survive through a problem only someone of your skill can solve. The main story arc however is a highly uninteresting jumble of nonsense. I liken the experince to someone who cant speak english trying to teach me a forign language ive never heard. I still to this day have no idea who the F the Fae are and why i should give a crap that 'thier time is coming to an end.'  With that said the gameplay elements that keep me playing past the half way point are all present and like an MMO you dont really need to pay any mind to the story to get and enjoyable experience. The world itself is much more linear than they would have you belive , and since a zone only scales to your level the first time you enter there is very little reason to backtrack except when you want/need to visit trainers.  Overall i would rate this game a 7/10.A Solid RPG if you can ignore the giant bag of corn they call a story.

As soon as the game throws you out of that initial sequence you're pretty much free to roam as you please, it was quite a while before I touched on the main quests because I was so busy being distracted by side missions. The combat feels so invigorating as well, the smoothness of it is a plus point in its own. Regarding game-play and artistic stlye - It's very much reminiscient of Fable - if it were set to be an MMORPG minus the MMO, this is a single-player game with a lot of meat. There's obviously some issues with it, though so far during my play-time I haven't come across anything major - no game breaking bugs as of yet. I've heard people complain about the inventory system, but it seems pretty straight forward to me. The base character customisation is adequate at best (Appearance wise I mean, skills / levelling are quite extensive), and beyond the quest dialogue - communicating with NPC's seems rather repetitive and pointless. Those being my only real gripes, I'd have to say that by the time you realise how many hours you've clocked into this game and knowing that you've enjoyed every one - you'll think this was a definite worthwhile investment.

Faction quest are expample of better ones, you get some choices, story behind said facion and decent loot, so if you want to skip most of the side quests dont skip facion ones. You might consider skipping because you get heavily over leveled and open world enemies doesn't scale with your level, quest enemies do and most of the dungeon are scaled too but it's inconsistent.  World is pretty, colorful and with nice desing with some great looking landscapes and some stunning towns.  Although dungeon assets are heavely reused(it seem's like dungeons were desinged by at least 2 teams, with some having shortcut to exit, while in others you have to backtrack), same can be said about enemies, you will be fighting variations of the same mobs you meet within first 5 hours(DLC's have few new ones).  Combat. Yes this is where the game shines, meaty swings, hit sounds. Combat is great and thats what kept me playing, slaughtering hundreds of enemies was very enjoyable.  Crafting is very overpowered, whitch i took advantage of and bacame juggernaut of destruction, choosing 'nah i just wanna kill you' dialog option when some evil mastermind wanted to tell me why he does what he does and because story isn't very compeling that was the most fun option.

That being said, mods put Skyrim leagues above this game.   Aside from that, KO:A is an open world RPG where you can choose most of your own fate and change the fate of those around you based on your decisions. The world in this game is laden with fate and those who can read the strings of fate. You are an abnormality that bends fate to your own will and even use it as a weapon itself.   The game has 3 different combat styles that can greatly differ depending on how you play your character.  -The first is a warrior, the obvious and probably the main combat style for humans. You can go in with a heavy weapon, such as a greatsword for powerful slow swinging attacks. A warhammer to bash your enemies in with brutal force. Finally a longsword for closing the gaps and decent combos against your enemies.  -The second is the mage, and personally my favorite playstyle. The weapons here dont matter as much except to augment the damage of your skills. They consist of short range staffs, medium range chakrams, and long range staves. At higher levels you can summon a rain of fire, a lightning storm, or a condensed blizzard to take out your enemies.  -The last playstyle is that of an assassin. Their weapon set consists of daggers, faeblades, and bows. Short, medium, and long range respectively. The assassin deals mainly with bleeds and poison, causing damage over time and time to set up cunning traps to finish them off. Each of these paths get their own destinies (unrelated to the storyline) and buffs.   My main complaints with the game is the massive amount of gold fodder for either a house, upgrading your pack, or repairing weapons.  -I also have a problem how this game also tries to copy Diablo a little bit, though does it a bit poorly. As such you have sets in the game that rarely show up, and by the time you get anything more than one piece of the set, you've already out leveled it to the point where the set bonus won't bring it to par. Easily fixed by a shared inventory between characters, but not going to happen.  -Some of the skills and playstyles don't feel viable for progressing either. Though you can become an alchemist or blacksmith, you would spend an immense amount of time trying to progress by taking these paths.   All in all, I think this is a really good game, even after 4 years if it releasing, and I still come back to playing it time and time again, not even always on PC. I would suggest this game for anyone who enjoys open world RPGs.",

I was reading a few of the ingame journals I found in a cave, and I completely forgot I was playing a game still, I was totally sucked into this small story and it left me amazed. - Combat system is very fun. - The way the leveling system is built is genius to me. Being able to chose Rogue/Mage, Mage/Warrior or whatever combination made it very engadging. - The Character design is beautiful. Nothing feels better then having a complete set of badass armor equipped. Not t mention the world area's are beautiful and vibrant.   Cons  - Camera is finky sometimes. It very rarely causes problems, but when it does you notice. - The amount of side-quests is almost overwhelming at times.  - Inventory system isn't perfect (No RPG's are) but its not difficult enough that it gets in the way.",

The game was definitely meant to be an MMO and the amount of side quests you will encounter while progressing through an otherwise fantastic story is staggering. If you take the time to learn about WHY you are fighting you will find an enjoyable narrative penned by fantasy legend RA Salvatore. Even on the hardest mode you will find the game is a good bit easy. As a straight mage I was able to use 2 or 3 spells and win every fight just casting them over and over while letting my undead minion heal me as he fought all the monsters on the map at the same time with a seemingly endless supply of hitpoints. And if you want to be even more overpowered simple enter reckoning mode and blow everything up all at once, and suck out their soul while you're at it, because... why not?

It features a moderately big, open world and hundreds of quests for you to do in spare time. The lore seems rich but it's not for me to decide if it's very likeable or interesting. The overall gameplay mechanics work fine and combat is pleasantly dynamic. Reckoning works well with both a gamepad and mouse &amp; keyboard. To sum it up - a good game. But if you're looking for major epicness to strike your heart I don't think this is the right place.

Admitedely the start is very slow, but once you get into the swing of things, its a game that can keep you playing with the mindset of 'just 1 more mission...just 1 more....' The highlights are an open world environment very similar to the fable series, a choice system via dialogue very much akin to bioware games, random loot similar to arpgs, static monster spawns (clearing an area will cause monsters to respawn later). Another underrated aspect of the game is the destiny class system. A player is able to choose or combine from three professions (magic warrior or finesse) and receieve bonuses based on which they choose. At max level one will have 123 skill points, so to gain a purist bonus from one of those 3 classes, you need 109 points in a tree, a dual spec would be 55 in two or a universalist is 37 in each. Each specialization gives a different bonus such as archmage (109 magic) awarding fate orbs on kills, an ice damage teleport and elemental damage, whereas a combination of finesse/sorcery gives a poison damage blink among other things. With all that in mind, one is able to find a fateweaver in many parts of the game and respec for gold if they so choose. So one day you want to bash people with a hammer? No problem, tommorow you can play like a ninja.  The only problem I have with the game is the camera angles. For example, in one of the DLCs there is a race, which is easy enough, but to have to worry about camera angles adjusting while trying not to get slapped by a mob is somewhat annoying. All in all, you cant go wrong buying this huge game on sale at such a ridiculously low price.",

This game was made in the Big Huge Engine, and I must admit that the world is pretty Big Huge. There's always something new around every single corner, whether it's a new enemy type you've never seen, or a new sidequest you can do. Speaking of sidequests, there's a lot of them. I'm about twenty hours into the game and I've barely progressed in the main campaign because there are so many fun and interesting sidequests. I always have at least ten active quests at a time.  The combat is really fun. It's simple, but it's also quite deep, and it even comes with fighting game-esque combos you can pull off for maximum damage to your enemies. Combat can be extremely varied and is significantly different for each class or multi-class, and even among each class there are different weapon types to spice things up even more. The only problem I have with the combat is that at times it can be a bit too easy, especially if you play like I do and you save all of your fate for boss battles, which makes many boss fights easier than taking on three or four smaller enemies.    This game has quite the pedigree. The world of Amalur was crafted by R.A. Salvatore, who is a best selling fantasy writer. I haven't read any of his works, but after playing this game I'm quite interested in looking into some of his stuff. The world is so fleshed out, and for a fantasy setting it's quite original. There are some fantastic ideas that really make this world stand out from settings such as Middle Earth or Tamriel, which are both great worlds, if a bit generic. The artwork was done by Todd McFarlane, and he brings such an amazing spin to everything, making everything in this game range from really pretty to horrifying and creepy. The lead designer of Oblivion also worked on this game, and in some areas that's very obvious, and all around it is very welcome. This game has some incredible genes going for it, with people from the top of their respective fields bringing something to this game.   This game is the best RPG I have ever played, and also possibly the best GAME I have ever played. I sunk over three hundred hours into Skyrim over a three year period. In the next year alone I forsee myself dumping significantly more than that into this game. It has fantastic replay value, and even if you don't replay it there's enough content in it to put in well over four hundred hours in a single game. With potentially over a thousand hours of content, I think that forty dollars for the game and DLC bundle is well worth the price, with some of the best value for money I have ever seen in a game.   If you require a number rating, I give this game 9.9/10",

It's like the b-movie of RPGs, dumb but fun. And that's a welcome change after torturing your brain with tons of hardcore RPGs. Also the world is big and beautiful, it's very simple to dive into it. The Harry Potter-esque soundtrack makes it even more relaxing, I could probably take a nap while playing. And the voice acting really sounds like directly from a 50s b-movie, it's incredibly bad and that's fun to me.  The cons are: It will probably get boring soon. The story is so full of tropes and stereotypes, but what do you expect from Salvatore. The game kind of feels like it just copied everything from other games.

Lore, quests, even random NPC chatter is amusing, interesting, and energetic. I went into the game as a fan of R.A. Salvatore and came out very happy that his style and creativity translated really well into the video game world. 10/10, 5 stars, and *confetti explosion* for this video game's writing and dialogue.   Combat: This aspect of the game I felt was it's shortcoming. Any weapon and path you choose always ends up the same. You can take on monsters 4 levels above you without effort pretty early into the game and storyline bosses are extremely easy. That being said, there was a nice feeling of impact with large weapons, but little to no impact with small weapons or magic. 4/10 (no confetti explosion).  Zones/Ambiance/Leveling: I group these things together because, to me, they all mean the same thing. If you like the zone, you will level faster, enjoy the quests and leveling process more and feel more 'in tune' and immersed in the game. The zones, frankly, ranged from unbelievable fantasy art with such attention to detail I couldn't believe it wasn't a cinematic... to utterly dry, boring dust bowl that I had to slog through and couldn't spend one more second in or I would quit. The variances of the zones ensure that anyone who picks up the game will have a good time, but I wish they hadn't sacrificed quality for variety. 6/10   DLC: I only bought 1 DLC, Legend of Dead Kel, and it was a good bit of fantasy candy to spend a couple days on, refurbishing a home, getting ridiculous gear and generally exploring a small private island you can put your personal touch on. Definitely a good pack for the cost. 8/10  Overall: 28/40 (70%) I really enjoyed this game over the course of a couple months.

            "review_text": "Amalur could've used a bit more polish before release. It has its ups but the downsides keep it from being awesome. If you're a fan of western action RPGs, chances are you'll get some enjoyment out of this, but for it to be considered great, takes a certain type of personal taste. Kingdom's of Amalur isn't a masterpiece, but it's not god-awful either, thankfully. Perhaps most of the issues could be fixed if a sequel is ever made, though that seems unlikely with the developer having gone bankrupt.  Mind you, I'm still going through the game so some of these points may change.  The good:  + Customizable combat. You can switch between a mage, rogue or warrior or a combination of any of them pretty easily, and there're multiple weapon types in the game, which feel varied enough to keep things interesting. Bonus points for making Chakrams NOT SUCK  + Executing entire packs of enemies through Fate is pretty fun to watch  + The atmosphere &amp; exploration. I've rather enjoyed running around, discovering hidden loot caches and secret rooms, and the world's varied enough for me to enjoy exploring it  + The music. I found it rather relaxing in downtime, and exciting enough to fuel the fights in combat, though more variety would've been welcome  + The lore. I find this concept of a 'Fateless' person that is able to stand against the pre-determined destiny rather fascinating  The Bad:  - The graphics are a bit dated, even considering that the game went for a bit cartoony appearance which tends to age well  - Using Fate in combat is a quicktime event. I hate quicktime events. But at least it's brief  - Some weapons are broken, chief offenders being the bow and chakrams. You can completely stunlock some, if not all, enemies with them  - The inventory system is complete ♥♥♥♥. Each new thing takes up a spot and comparing items is a pain. And it takes ages to vendor everything, and you will be doing this a lot because most of the loot is completely useless.  - Money drops left and right. I haven't managed to drop below 60 thousand gold pieces yet, and it just keeps building up. And I'm not sure what there is to spend it on aside from inventory upgrades, since I've found all my best items  Personal pet peeves:  * There is no jump button, and jumping around in RPGs is something I rather enjoy * Default controls use Shift for Block, not Sprint, unlike pretty much every half-decent game made since the late 90ies.",

I feel like this is a game that, at the same time, wants to be Dragon Age, World of Warcraft and God of War. The good part is that it pulls this all off well enough. The story, while partaking of the age old trope that You and You alone, through a method remeniscent of Soul Reaver, are free from the bindings of destiny and actually have free will with which to change the world, is well written enough. The plot is decent for what it is, and you can see the hand of R.A. Salvatore all over it even before realizing that he hand a hand in writing the game. I really wish the PC could have been allowed to emit more of a personality, but the lack of such only gave me the chance to fill in the blanks with my imagination. The more action oriented gameplay is also neat and can be fun, though at times I felt the controls were so unresponsive that even with highly honed reflexes I still couldn't have dodged/blocked that hit that killed me in that last boss fight. It isn't so bad that you can't adjust, however.  The part where is resembles World of Warcraft is the part that buggers me, though. I'm only about 20 hours in and I'm already getting burned out on all the supefluous side quests. Some aren't so bad and have their own neat sotrylines, but way too many are the standard 'Go get me/kill X number of Y' MMO stuff that has you traversing an entire area map just for that XP boost, because lord know you're not doing it for the randomly generated loot. That's another thing I loathe, since I typically finding myself selling the worthless stuff I get for quests or from drops and chests. I don't know who it was who thought randomly generated loot was a good idea, but I really hope it's not something that becomes the norm.  Still, though, I got this game for a steal and it's pretty decent for what I paid. I'm having fun with it and that's the important part, right?",

            "review_text": "TL; DR: If you like fantasy RPG's this is a game you must play. solid 9/10.  Now i actually want to adress some things i like/dislike about the game,by the way i have about 100 hours in game, half of it was offline.  First of all, unlike in some reviews i saw, i will say professions are a big deal. My main has max blacksmithing and sagecrafting(gemcrafting) at max and my custom made armor and weapons are unmatched, i haven't found any weapon/armor pieces that is better than my gear yet. I like this, but there is a downside too, i have been running with same looking gear for more than half of the game. I mean, i craft new gear from time to time but in the end they look the same. Which is sad considering there are some great looking items in the game and i would like to wield them. And potion crafting is almost necessary in early game because you can just get locked from 2-3 enemies simultaneously attacking you and you die after 2-3 hits in early game on hard. But when you get some good gear it's almost useless.  Also, there are TONS of things to do, sidequests and errands(quests you can do over and over again) you can do, achievements to hunt, different playstyles you can try (for affordable money you can reset your skills/stats anytime in game), tons of lore to read (or listen from lorestones), huge world to explore. I love this, but yet again it brings something rather unpleasant too, you can pretty much get overpowered in midgame if you like to do any kind of quest/errand you find, which i tend to do. This makes the game really easy even on hard, specially if you craft your own gear.  Artstyle of the game, i think, is fantastic. Voicework is too good (specially Alyn Shir). Enemies are mostly unique. World design is superb.  I think the thing that could put a lot of people down is the level design, and game design in general. What i mean by that is, you can't jump, you can only jump from certain jump points. This actually is a big deal when you think about it. lets say you are on something that is about 30cm above ground. You just can't jump off or walk off and go on, minor things like that. Game design is, lets say, 'linear open world'. Map is consisted off very clear and distinct areas, which are again divided by sub areas, if you take a look at the map you will see what i mean.  Story is cliche but somewhat original too. I'd say it's a fresh take on the whole chosen one saves the world thing. I don't want to spoil much but it's just good.  Solid controls and a good combat system, almost all spells/weapons have at least 2 styles of attack, if not more. Like longsword has a basic swing if you just tap, a dash if you long press, if you double tap and pause and attack again it lifts the enemy up in the air etc. there are lots of combos and since you can equip two weapons at time to switch between, you can get a lot of cool interactions. There is also reckoning mode which has really cool finisher moves. There is also stealth in the game which i can not comment on because i never felt the need to use it since my character is a tanky beast.  There is also a twists of fate system which i find really cool, let's say you finished a long questline,main or side, that means you will probably get a twist of fade card, which will boost some effects on your character permanently. And sometimes actions you take during the questline will change the card you will get, and also will effect your game (for example in warsworn questline you can end up making them hate you or praise you, so they will either attack you on sight or be your allies.)  There is room for a lot of customization since there is no distinct classes in game, you can choose to spend your skill points in three skill trees without limitations, kind of like warrior,rogue and mage skill trees. You can make a rogue/mage, a warrior/rogue or so on. When you put enough point in a skill tree, or a combo of skill trees, you unlock destiny cards which will have effects varying from +% attack damage to changing your dodge roll with a shor ranged teleport.  There are 9 weapon types(sceptre,staff,chakram,longsword,greatsword,hammer,dagger,faeblade,longbow), lots of unique weapons with cool effects and looks (for example i had a pair of daggers which did fire damage at day and ice damage at night called 'shine and shadow'). Lots of armor types (leather, trollhide, sylvanite etc.) and lots of accessories with cool effects.  I want to talk about the DLC too, Weapons&amp;Armor bundle is almost completely useless, i mean, it does give you a head start but it will only last about an hour or so. Then you will start to find better gear. I just made a character in which i rush the main quest, no sides, no exploring just straight marching on the main quest line. Even tho it means i neglect main means of getting gear, in about 2.5-3 hours i replaced all the gear i got from the DLC. So i will say pass on that. But Dead Kel and Naros are actually quite good. Both come with completely unique areas, enemies, lore, stories, characters and gear. Which i dig.  Now, i could just go on and on about this game but i will just say one more thing and finish my review, People love to compare this game to skyrim, while you are not as 'free' in this game i would say in terms of combat, artstyle, enemy/environment/gear variety, and lore this game is way superior. (About the lore thing, i know elder scrolls universe has tons of written lore and all but, in my personal experience, when i played skyrim i never actually considered, thought of lore, i didn't think the continent was built into the lore, it felt more like lore was built into the continent, which may not be the case but it just feeled that way.)  It's definetely a must play for Fantasy RPG fans. ",

            "review_text": "A great action adventure role-playing game with a vast open world to explore and many quests to complete. Plenty of skill trees to try out and crafting to do, from potions to blacksmithing to enchantment. Suffers from clunky interface and at times it can feel grindy. All the characters are however, well voice acted and can bring a lot of life to the game. Finally, all cutscenes (and dialogue) are skippable. So yay to that. Worth purchasing during the sale, at $10 for base + all DLC.  Perhaps the greatest cons that are holding this game back in my opinion, is the very clunky interface when it comes to inventory and quest management. Instead of pressing, say, 'I' to open up an inventory screen, you have to press ESC to go to the menu and access your inventory from there. You can also only track one quest at a time, and can only view other quests on your local map provided that you're in the correct zone (this took a bit to figure out, but once it was figured out the single-quest tracking no longer posed a problem). Any other quests outside of your zone will not show up on your minimap. The game also has lots of loading screens, though they are rarely more than 10 seconds each, split between instances and interior / exterior transitions.   The game's combat can be very fun, a hack and slash sort of feel, with contextual 'moves' to use (i.e. pausing just before a second attack and you will launch enemies into the air) and the variety of skills to invest into can really mix up the gameplay. There's also a fate meter, which is essentially an execution bar where you go into a rage and deal extra damage whilst everything around you moves in slow motion, then you can execute enemies which kills all 'knocked down' enemies around you, whilst granting you bonus XP. You have your wizard, rogue and warrior skill tree. You have two weapon slots to quickly switch between as well as a 1-9 spell slot (casted by right clicking). The control might feel a bit console-like at first, but it's no where near as bad of a port as some other games have been (i.e. dark souls). Simply put, very playable. The graphics also look aesthetically pleasing, no real complaints.  There's a lack of 'open world' things to do beyond questing and hunting mobs, though there is more than enough dialogue to fill in each city / town / hub as well as letters and books to collect.  A revamped interface (as in, an actual in-game UI inventory screen, quest tracker and similar, would be significantly more palatable than its current clunky interface) and the addition of a few mounts could really improve this game.  Probably an 8/10. Definitely should pick this up during the sale (currently at 10$ for base game + all the DLC, which are worth the money).",

It does stroke the player's ego quite a bit, what with all the 'Chosen One' Themes, the NPCs are consistently impressed with your perfomance.  - There's quite a lot to do, thought the side quests can get repetitive. Once i reached the level Cap i couldn't be bothered to do most of it, specially considering i could craft much better gear than any quest reward at that point.  - It's definitely not a difficult game, in late game i was able to stomp everything in Hard quite handly, and i'm only a mostly competent player at best. seriously thought, by the end of the game all but a single type of attack (piercing, i believe) did any damage to my character, he literally could not be hurt from almost anything, on Hard.",

            "review_text": "The Story:   I found out about this game after doing some late night googling on Salvatore. 20 years ago I started reading his books and was amazed that I completely missed the fact that he worked on a game and it immediately went on my wishlist. The main story was okay, I don't really have any complaints but I didn't really feel any Salvatore coming through and I am unmoved. Anyone could have written/helped write the world and I wouldn't know any difference.   The Art:   Simultaneously I found out Todd Mccfarlane had some play in the art and I have an entire box of Spawn comics. My favorite childhood artist and writer together for one game, holy ♥♥♥♥. The color is great in the game but the lack of detail is mind boggling. Todd put so much detail into spawn comics and seeing character models without fingernails was just disgraceful. The graphics and animations are rather plain and nothing here is an artistic achievement. At one cutscene I recall a female soldier being shot in the back with an arrow and I think they tried to animate blood coming out of her mouth but it just looked like it was pouring out her face. Mediocrity is the theme for the art.   The Gameplay:   Through and through this is a single-player MMO action rpg. You could take any free to play mmo, remove the multiplayer and nothing about this game would outshine any of the uncountable amounts of games in the genre. Pretty much each zone has a town, each town has npcs with exclamation marks giving out fetch and kill quests. Each zone is linked together by a passage. There are basic tradeskills with the classic WoW style herb gathering, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing (except the last two you get regeants from chests and not nodes) and you don't need to invest in any of them although healing potions are the end all-most powerful item in the game as you can just spam them like Diablo 1. The skilltrees are decent, on par with something like diablo 2. The combat is mediocre to bad for an action game but better than an RPG like Skyrim. The main storyline is about 12 hours long and 'literally' 70% of the time you will be walking from one point to another like a really bad mmo, 20% of the time you will sit in inconsequential conversations and 10% fighting. The final boss was terribly boring/uninspiring/unchallenging and the entirety of the game was not challenging except at one point my main quest enemies became red (as opposed to neutral level enemies that are yellow, just like any mmo) and they were mostly unkillable. I went back to the surface leveled twice off yellow monsters (the 'open world' monsters scale to your level) came back and walked through the rest of the game without even trying.   Verdict:  Theres a lot of game here.. You could put 200 hours into fetch and kill quests if you wanted to and you can respec your skills as much as you want. If you (like me) have a history of playing mmos and you have no desire to grind out fetch quests ever again for the rest of your life just avoid this less than mediocre ftp-single player-mmo action game. If you have never played an mmo, or you love fetch and kill quests this game is ripe with them for many many hours.",

You can choose Primary and Secondary weapons to switch up your gameplay on the fly, which is really helpful. In addition, you can put 4 spells/skills into your slots and use at any time.  You also have access to a wide array of non-combat skills that help you create powerful weapons, craft helpful potions, and persuade the masses, to give a few examples. You'll want to stick with 3-4 main skills to level up, as you only have 40 levels to work with. Personally, Detect Hidden and Persuade are essential to see all the cool stuff available.  There are 5 main areas in Amalur, and each are unique in their appearance and ascetic. Each area has a lot of quests and places to explore. There are also 5-ish factions, each unique and fun to play through.  Due to your Fateless nature, you create Twists of Fate during big moments in the story and during faction quests. These Twists will benefit your stats, and will potentially change the faction you're working with for the rest of the game. These faction Twists have two paths you can take, meaning you have to play the game twice to see what both Twists offer.  Now this game, despite how good it is, does have some flaws. To begin with, there are some quests that have a chance to break, and will keep you from Fast Travelling if that happens, so save often. Persuasion has a percentage chance o work, but even at full Persuade, the highest chance to work is 95%, meaning you'll probably want to save if you are going to use that skill.  The targeting system is really bad, considering the nature of this game's combat. It's very difficult to change targets during combat, and sometimes you'll want to attack someone else during Reckoning Mode, but still keep wailing on an opponent who is already at the prompt. This game also has some quests that require you to escort/'ally' with NPC's that will fail your quest if they die. However, it is really easy for them to run off and get themselves killed while you're trying to fight off an opponent. It really doesn't help that enemies love to attack teammates, and I can't seem to find a way to draw aggro consistently.  In addition, the game's length, even if you skip the factions and most of the side quests, will still take a long while to finish. This can create fatigue, especially during the final haul, where it might feel like it'd be best to run past every enemy rather than deal with all the encounters you run into.  The DLC is also good, with Teeth of Naros being the best of the two expansions. The bosses in both are challenging but fun, and the areas added have plenty of content.  I bought this game and the DLC for $9.99 during a Sale, and I believe that the game is worth the initial $19.99, but I'd wait until the DLC's price goes down during another Sale to pick them up. This game can be frustrating at times, and I don't think I'll be playing again for a while, as this game can fatigue you with it's length. But Kingdoms of Amalur is a really fun game that you'll clock many hours into.",

There is the occasional camera issue and the absence of a jumping ability does give the game the feeling that it's lacking something, especially when you can't jump off cliffs unless you're standing on a specific location. Some of the locations can also feel generic and some of the enemies attacks just feel like they're hacking away at your health, which can ruin any sense of strategy.   All of those are minor flaws, though. The biggest flaw of the game is when you're fighting multiple enemies at once. You'll be hacking away at an enemy, then another enemy will injure you and you'll automatically lock onto that new enemy. This can get frustrating when you're facing off with a boss and they summon a swarm of monsters. You're character will keep getting hit, hack at that enemy, get hit again, turn around and hack at that enemy, then get hit again and hack at that enemy. This can cause the fight to last forever because you're not locked on to one enemy long enough to actually kill them.  This may seem like a lot of complaints, but I've gotta admit that I still really like the game. The story is interesting, with a deep lore, and you can usually either work around or suffer through the enemy locking problem. The bottom line is that, despite its flaws, this game is very entertaining.",

Kingdoms of Amalur is without a doubt one of the best free world rpg's out there. With a fast paced combat system that varies drastically depending on weapon choice, a unique doging ability allowing for quick strategy, and an amazing storyline crafted by the great R. A. Salvatore himself, this game is one you should not miss out on. Personally, I am a huge fan of R. A. Salvatore's works and my view on the story may be a bit biased in saying it is top notch, but regardless of how biased my opinion is, any fan of fantasy will respect this story and recognize the genius behind it. The graphics are also fantastic in this game as well; i never had a single problem while running it.  All in all, this was a great game for the price. Plus, if you can grab it on sale, as it is now for 5.99, dont hesitate  updating for nomination badge, still an amazing game",

            "review_text": "The title Kingdoms of amakur: Reckoning does not sound very promising. It sounds like the most generic pile of garbage, and in all honesty I expected it to be ♥♥♥♥. However, it turned out to be quite a bit better than I expected.  The highlight of the game is the combat. It's fluid, fast and fun. Nothing special about that really. It's a lot like a fighting system from a hack and slah game. The game does get REALLY combat heavy towards the end, which get's kinda annoying. The fighting can also get repeative, because it's not that complex, and there is just so much of it overall.Actually, my main problem with the game is that it's simply way too easy. I can count all of my deaths with 1 hand, and no, my hand does not have 36 fingers or anything like that. However, I do like the big world, and all the places that you can visit. I really wanted to explore the world and see new places, even though a lot of the tombs and caves are really bland.  On the other hand, the story and characters are really uninteresting. I never really cared about what was happening, and I barely remember any characters, Not exactly a good sign. I am also not a big fan of the visual style, just because it doesn't match the tone of the game at all.   This game is quite lengthy overall. I took me about +30 hours to finish, and in that time I almost got to the max level, and I beat quite a lot of the side missions, so that is pretty neat. I have heard that this game has enough content for over 100 hours, but I personally have my doubts about this. Many things in this game kinda give me the impression that this could have become a new fantasy RPG series, but that will most likely not be happening.  This game is not great, but it's not nearly as bad as I expected it to be. Even though the story and characters are weak, I still had a fun time playing through this game. Generally my feelings towards the game can be summarized with: It's fine",
