    "description": "INK is a fast-paced platformer about using colorful paint to uncover your surroundings. Defeat all enemies in the room and reach the goal! However, the terrain is invisible, so you need to discover the terrain by physically bumping into it, by performing a double jump or by, well, dying.",

            "review_text": "A masterpiece, an absalute treat to play with very little to complain about!  Good: - A unique mechanic/gimic that is very VERY well implimented, makes a very personal feeling world with very pretty colours and therefore making dark confusing world into a bight vivid one. - A well designed death system, I'm not quite sure what to call this but the way the developers made it so that dyingis not always bad, it works so that dying now just a way to discover more bits of the level, that is until you splat the entire level with ink, then dying has no benefits, as it should be. The way that only double jumps splat ink everywhere is a great choice making levels more difficult and interesting. - A good difficulty curve, as a good precision platformerer like myself you would not find anything in the first 2 world too difficult and the 3rd world will get challenging, for newer players the game eases in to the difficulty very well making sure that the first 15-20 levels won't be tough, neither will the first boss. The game DOES get difficult and you will die many MANY times in your playthrough(s). Each enemy is brought in at a good time so levels don't feel repetative and then once you know hoe they behave, they get diffucult again. - Enemies are very predictable and the fact that they leave ink trails just adds to pretty nature of the game. I do have a few issues with the basic enemies as seen below - The physics is very nice and floaty simular to Super Meat Boy, it feels a bit slippery as you'd expect and suits the game well. - Fantastic level design, some levels are repeated with extra difficulty and enemies and I can't fault any level! - It is a great speedrun for people who want to get into speedrunning or for experienced runners, it becomes a test of memory to complete it, very fun!   Mixed: - Bosses are well done although I do have a few problems, the 2nd boss took me a while to figure out what I needed to do, once I'd done that it wasn't too bad and also the final boss (quite rightfully) alot harder than the others making it an interesting fight, it is hard but once you know the attacks it becomes quite easy to manipulate to your advantage, otherwise the bosses are well made, the first one is a great introduction to how you damage them. All in all well designed! - When you kill enemies, your sometimes feel like you can't get away from triggers that crush you, this maybe because you didn't hold the other direction soon enough. - For experienced precision plateformerers, the game can feel a little bit short but with mensions of DLC with more levels AND potential steam workshop support (one of the developers said this may be a possability when I talked to them) it should get even more reasons to play.  Bad: - Ememies. I have 2 problems with the normal enemies in this game:  1) The fact that you don't get your double jumo back after killing them (this is just personal preferance and is probably a design choice),  2) Going into the side of enemies feels inconsistant whether or not they die, again there may or may not be something I do not understand about this.   Conclusion: Very well made, solid game with minimal faults, definatly worth playing! I are a few issues but PLEASE don't let that put you off because this game is truely fabulous. It's so different and so interesting that anyone that gets this far through reading this review NEEDS TO PLAY THIS GAME...   NOW!!!",

PROS +Unique concept that works well +Looks really nice (sort of... more on this later*) +Fast-paced gameplay with usually pretty good level design +Nice amount of options for default controls; anything most people would want to use can be used  CONS -Capped at 30 frames per second... terrible -*Game is rendered at a low resolution -Inconsistent controls; especially in the air -Hitting corners at a certain angle will kill you for seemingly no reason -Homing projectiles home in way too accurately and are too difficult to dodge -Music is lackluster -Game is very short; 1.5 hours and I'm done already -No options menu: this means... -Resolution can not be changed, nor can the game be put into a windowed mode; it is fullscreen by default -Anything else that usually comes with an options menu cannot be changed  To expand on some of the points;  The inconsistent controls are one of this game's biggest problems; the momentum is very inconsistent. Trying to adjust the momentum of a jump whilst mid-air feels more like luck than anything else; you may completely change direction or you may just slow down. It's unnacceptable.  The homing projectiles can spin a full circle (360 degrees!) if you dodge them and will continue to home in on you, Need I say more?  I like the concept; it's really unique and works well. It pains me to write a negative review on this game. Unfortunately, the game is poorly built and very short. With all the issues this game has, I can't reccomend it. Even if the developers fixed all of the issues I've listed, I still would not reccomend that you buy this game at full price. Seeing as how the game only lasted me 1.5 hours, I'd pay 4 bucks for it at the very most.  If one of the developers reads what follows this, they will surely be insulted, but it's the truth, and it's the best way to sum up the review:  There are better, free flash games out there. Don't waste your money.",

            "review_text": "This game is a slight breath of fresh air if you've had a hard time finding a new platformer worth playing lately. Making the player become the catalyst that reveals the platforms that are hidden adds a surprisingly non-obtrusive mechanic to the platforming in INK. The very bright contrasting colors your character (Of seemingly white light or something of the sort) shoots out colors across the spectrum when it double jumps, runs along the ground, or meets its early demise.  Dying almost becomes an additional tool to aid you in completeing a level, and for obvious purpose. The soundtrack is very ambient and calming, which complements the early levels of INK, but make no mistake, the difficulty does ramp up in time!  Controls feel tight and reminiscient of Super Meat Boy, I don't feel cheated if I fall to my death because its not typically because of a bugged jump or something of the sort.   All pros aside, there is one con I find that detracts enough that it is worth mentioning. This game seems to be capped at 30 FPS and it shows when the colored ink flies through the air, or when you move your character around. The bright and very contrasting colors can also be a factor if your prone to eye strain from numerous bright/saturated colors.  I would say this game is definitely worth playing, but I truly hope the Devs make it so it runs at 60 FPS, and you can swap out the color pallete of the ink with different palletes, like monochromatic, split complementary, and other color schemes, rather than just super bright colors.  8/10, I will be playing this more and more.",

            "review_text": "Well well, now here's a surprisingly simple yet fun and hard game. Platformers aren't really my thing, but this game is a welcomed exception.  I usually don't do reviews but this game does deserve one. This is probably one of the more challenging platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. And I love a good challenging game. Makes me think over just what it is that I have to do in order to advance to the next part of the level; how can I make this jump; how is this jump even possible; how do I even get that coin?! This game forces you to think fast, something I'm not used to, but something I definitely appreciate. The fast pace of the game only adds to the challenge, because you have to tap your keys just enough to make that landing or risk overshooting it. Oh man, and the complexity of the jumps you have to make is just well thought out. Kudos to the developer for putting complexity into simplicity. The only thing that I am kind of frustrated with is...my tendency to hit the 'A' button when really I want to hit the 'D' button. Damn me and my weak hand-eye coordination.  But overall, I give this game a 9/10. Why? Because sometimes a simple game can be just as good as a game like Skyrim. Definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for fun and a simple challenge in their gameplay.",

I'm not particularily good at platforming, but not entirely bad either. With that in mind; I beat the game in one sitting in 94mins (my playtime may go up to farm cards). With 75 levels the game is broken into thirds with a boss marking each 25th level. The real challenge isn't found until the final third of the game. It takes the Super Meat Boy endless life approach with short levels, slidy controls, wall jumping, double jumping and blood stains left over from the last life. There is even a similar behaving key system and similar 'smart' projectiles in that challenging final third of INK. The one unique thing it has going is that every level starts blind. And your 'blood' is colorful ink that paints your surroundings and reveals the task at hand. Deaths as well as double jumping spews the colorful ink about. Its interesting in its own right but I wish the rest of the game was as original.   While I had fun and enjoyed the challenge my recommendation is very reserved. Its too short and way too familiar to pay full price for even if that price is low. This is a perfect bundle game though.",

INK is a twitch-platformer based on the principle of learning from your mistakes. Anything the player touches leaves spatters of paint on its surface. Even when the player dies, paint is released. This basic mechanic instills a sense of discovery in a subgenre that often misses the mark in this regard. INK is definitely one of those ‘just one more level’ type of games, and maybe one of the most addictive games of 2015. What seems so simple on the surface turns out to be one of 2015’s best games.

It takes Super Meat Boy's challenge and combines it with the goal of splattering paint everywhere in order to see the area, playing with the concept of the unknown environment around you. The game starts out with exploration as the focus, making you use your paint to discover the level around you, and ends with ridiculous challenge as you die hundreds of times trying to dodge projectiles among showers of color. There are collectibles that are very difficult to find unless you splatter paint everywhere, and most require you to think outside the box to reach.  Overall, the game is short but well worth the money. I've never seen this concept before, and especially wouldn't have expected to see it done so well without another game like it out there. It's about 2 hours long if you're experienced with platformers, but it was more worthy of my money than a 2 hour long movie would have been, and it costs much less than a ticket would have.",

You must get to the end of the level, and more requirements are necessary to get there as the levels progress from defeating enemies and unlocking areas. More mechanics are gradually introduced, often shocking you at first but nearly immediately becoming easy to understand so no tutorials are necessary. The mechanic of revealing the platforms around you is done as well as I'd like it to be done, and as the main gimmick I feel it was a strong point, however....  After the first boss the difficulty increases dramatically. This however is a nice change from the fairly easy preceeding levels. After the second boss, the difficulty changes for the worse, making most levels just a matter of memorizing the exact second to jump, trying to ignore the constant screen shaking from enemies and ink splattering, and trying your hardest to do everything frame perfect. Combined with the inertia and sloppy controls, it makes it more frustrating than fun. Combined with heat seeking missles that are faster than you, it becomes a real chore. The final boss was a good design, however how to damage it seemed inconsistent - what would hurt it one time kills you another with no discernable reason as to why. There is some replay value as there's a hidden item in (seemingly) each level, however I would not be inclined to play through again to collect them.",

This momentum will also continue if you land on an enemy, if you land on an enemy that is close to the edge of the stage you will be forced to continue your momentum to your death.

            "review_text": "At first I was really into INK. I got it as a part of a bundle and was curious. 5 minutes in I was thinking about the neat visual style and ambient music and how death is actually helpful in a way as it covers new hidden platforms. In fact, even running around covering platforms with ink was fun and I felt a bit of a Splatoon-ish satisfaction for covering as many surfaces as I could. You sort of swapped between scouting out platforms in a level and moving towards the level’s exit. Dying meant little other than a bit more ink near that platform you’ve been struggling on, making it a bit more visible. Finally, I thought, a nice stress-less, enjoyable platformer.   Oops. It was Super Meat Boy in disguise. I mean, I should’ve guessed. Slippery, momentum-based platforming where moving creates a color to show where you have been and where you have died. I don’t know what I was excepting. I guess I was really just hoping for something a bit more relaxing after finishing some homework, buying the bundle containing and then giving it a play before bed.  There was one level that got me frustrated that was pretty early on. I had to do with having to jump from one side of the more longitudinal map to the other killing enemies to unlock the exit. I won’t get into too much detail but there were two enemies place on the far left/right, very close to the edge. When you touch the edge, you die. When you bounce off an enemy, you keep your momentum. So I tried and tried to make a huge jump up to the next platform and then jump on the enemy while also moving a little to the left to avoid hitting the edge but not too far to avoid falling or having the enemy run into me. And it gets weirder because the next level was a breeze. For some reason the game just really wanted me to experience this learning curve and really drive how a kind of minor scenario that could’ve been show through a much less frustrating experience. Heck, in the next handful of levels you don’t even really get close to the walls of the level.  This game, based off the little I’ve played, does this a lot. It has a just rude level that interrupts the occasional string of neutral or fun stages. Plus it’s hard to ‘hate’ at times as the visuals and music are very, can I say…relaxing? Interesting? Whatever it is, they kept me playing.  Meat Boy is a hard game. And I’m the sort of person who isn’t a fan of difficult games despite their more rewarding pay off for beating a level. Completing a level begins to feel more like a chore than a challenge especially when it comes to a scenario where you see yourself die every 15 seconds only to give another shot at preforming perfectly in the same seemingly endless level where you spend 10 minutes dying on the same part only to move forward a little bit but still have to go through and die to the previous part a few more times. That’s kind of what Meat Boy is for me.   It’s only really when you’ve died plenty of times and the bit of ink that is flung up from your death stops helping you that thinks get frustrating. The ‘exploration phase’ is over and now it’s back to the grind stone to perfect your jumps in order to get past the level.  I probably won’t finish it. I know it’s gonna become even more difficult and, well, if I want more stress I can just do Honor’s Bio homework.  Like Meat Boy and colors? It’s a pretty cheap game, give a buy. It certainly got me thinking even if that wasn’t its intension. Oops.  I’ll be honest though: I kinda just feel like someone played a ton of Meat Boy and found themselves trying to paint all the surfaces of each level for fun. XD  [Wait. Did I just play a game for 20 minutes and then basically right an essay on it that compares it to Super Meat Boy while also analyzing what really seems to be the root of why I didn’t like that game too much either?

The music is fantastic, very calming and atmospheric, which certainly helps with keeping your cool while playing.  Gameplay is solid and addicting with good controls and physics, although it is slippery. The game also introduces new obstacles along the way and even has boss fights which are pretty cool, something I did not expect. Another thing to add is that when you fail its not that frustrating, you usually can get back to where you were pretty quickly. Half the time when I die, I help msyelf out by reaveling more of the level.  Despite the good there are some things that hold the game back a bit, one being the lack of an option menu. Its a bit annoying not being able to easily adjust the volume or resolution. There is also a 30FPS cap which is also annoying, but its does not kill the expirience.  Despite that, from what I have played so far I would rate this game an 8/10. Simple, but very much worth the $5 price tag",
