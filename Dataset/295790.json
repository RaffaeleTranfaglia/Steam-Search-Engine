            "review_text": "The fox is adorable and the cultural videos are interesting and informative, but the gameplay is repetitive, tedious, and glitchy in some parts. The game is only 3 hours long, but towards the end I just wanted it to be over. The developers did a nice job of gradually ramping up the platforming difficulty, but towards the end it gets really tedious: jump into wind gusts, switch to the other character to pull platforms, switch back, and jump again -- over and over. When you are playing solo, occasionally the computer will move the character you are not controlling in a way that causes it to die - forcing you to start over. That gets annoying after a while. It happens most when you are controlling the fox, which is too bad because playing as the fox is much more fun than playing as the girl.  All-in-all, I give Never Alone a 3 out of 5. Nice graphics, excellent animation, and interesting videos, but stale gameplay.",

Aside from playing game, you would get to experience their cultural traditions, right from their perspectives which are amazing and rarely seen. The key of the game is its story. Please remind yourself to watch every single video, provided from your playthrough. You will surely have a lot to experience.  Even though I played in single-player mode, I also loved how you can play in co-op with a friend. You could switch to play the fox or the girl in the needed time even when you chose to play it in single-player. Well, I had to, because in some evidence I had to play as a fox and vice versa. It was fun!  The characters are cute. The relationship between the girl and the fox are beautiful. The puzzles are fun. The soundtracks are awesome. Great game, great story and great idea! The only reason I felt sorry for this game is its horrible controls. What a pity! So be patient and wait for some bug fixes, then you will have no regrets!",

Right now I'm stuck at the floating ice area due to glitchy collision detection. Either my character or my companion keep getting stuck on the sides of the crunching platforms, getting bounced off from the corners, turning around and falling into the water, or the companion lingers back just a tiny bit enough to get crushed by the ice.   So far, it's a beautifuly presented story, with an obnoxious platform element wedged in.  While I do recommend it, I also recommend either having lots of patience or taking your meds before playing.",

            "review_text": "A game made with love, that I can not recommend.  The premise of the game is pretty interesting, we're presented with Alaskan indigenous stories in a playable form, with a cute little fox as our companion. The start of the game is great, a (very) young huntress tries to find the reason of a storm that has been active in the area for quite alot, to end it before her village dies of hunger, because they can't hunt like that. You walk, find a fox, and walk to the right, and walk a bit more, and a cutscene appears; occasionally the narrator tells you what's going on, and that's about it.   The platform parts were tedious; from what I recall, the fox has a mystical connection with spirits , and when he approaches them, they turn material and move to help our little protagonist, but they move slowly and you'll find yourself falling quite more times than you'd like to admit, the movable objects and puzzles are tedious and slow, you'll fail and get a bit angry because you wasted 1 minute just pushing a stick, and when you complete the puzzles you don't feel great, it's just like, 'ok', I don't know how to explain this.  After some time walking and walking and jumping you find your weapon, the 'bola'. To use it you have to use the right stick of your controller in a very weird way; I found it extremely inprecise and tedious; the first boss is just walking right and ocasionally hitting small fences that he creates of snow with your bola. VERY TEDIOUS and not rewarding at all, because of the horrible controls of the bola. I decided to quit the game because I wasn't really entertained.  I have to admit, the videos are pretty cool and you learn more about their civilization, you can see how the developers put lots of love in the game, and care. But the game per-sé is not enjoyable, in my opinion.",

My only gripe is that sometimes the A.I. partner can be stupider than a sock full of sawdust and run into the path of oncoming disaster. Or just toss themselves off the nearest ledge for no good reason at all.  Aside from that, it's a wonderful game with roots tied in a deep and vibrant culture. The collectible videos are pretty much a mini-documentary, but that's not something I'd really complain about.  To keep itshort, it's beautifully designed, the story is nothing short of simple and sweet, and it touches base on some issues concerning today's world as a whole. Yay learning. ",

            "review_text": "A Girl And Her Fox versus the Arctic  Absolutely wonderful. 3 hours long but it's varied throughout with one seriously epic finale that might remind of Shadow of the Colossus. The mechanics and setting make it a refreshing experience. There is a crazy plot twist that changes the gameplay significantly. Easily recommended if you're into a beautiful, awe-inspiring, and really challenging platformer. By challenging, I mean testing you on everything you've learned with quick timing towards the latter parts of the game. This isn't quite as breezy as Brothers or Journey.   It's a strong tale of courage to seek serenity in a harsh world full of spirits, blizzards, and along with the best and worst of humankind. What makes it more impressive to me is how the original character for the fable is meant to be a boy but here it's a girl and she's just a strong inspirational hero that doesn't get nerfed because of some plot convenience and isn't subservient to others.   Sometimes the AI can be a bit wonky, but you can manually switch between both the girl and the fox instantaneously. If you have friends/family/relative/significant other, I'd recommend playing with them as you hear them shriek at the challenges and chases like I did with my sister :D  Gorgeous is an understatement, coming from a small game made in Unity. The snow, wind, and ice effects along with the foley made me feel subconsciously a bit colder as I was playing. The narration during gameplay reminded me of Bastion, and if you're into games like Brothers, Limbo, or other cinematic platformers that have cool animations but can be a bit trial-and-error, check it out.   I would love more interactive tales that explore other cultures' mythos and fairy tales.",

            "review_text": "This 'game' is dreadful. An excercise in complete and utter boredom, frustrating controls, atrocious level design, and a nonsensical story. If you'd like to learn about the culture of these people then go for it, otherwise I can't in any state of mind recommend this.  I played through this in co-op thinking it'd be a fun short experience and we were bored to tears, the videos are interesting, but the gameplay is so repetitive and uninspired, causing nothing but frustration and confusion.   The pacing is all over the place, with the most exciting points being right at the beginning (the polar bear bits) and the ending being painfully tedious and anti-climactic.  There are endless amounts of glitches that will constantly send you back to your last checkpoint, and for a game that only lasts roughly three hours, after the first two or three levels I found myself longing for it to end, yet it dragged on and on and on and on.  There's a line in one of the videos which talks about how the Alaskan Natives are brilliant storytellers, which seemed to come through in some of the interviews (particularly the one about being stranded on the ice) but where was that ability during the creation of this game? The story is complete and utter nonsense, turning something as magical and beautiful as the Northern Lights into an infuriating obstacle that you can't wait to be finished with.  If you want a cute and difficult platformer, grab Ori and the Blind Forest, if you want a heartwarming and quirky story, pick up Gravity Ghost, but under no circumstance should you buy this if you're looking for a solid gaming experience. There are just so many better games out there, don't waste your time or money on this one.",

            "review_text": "This game is not so much a game as a documentary with a game in it to lead you to watch the documentary. And, I'll tell you what, that part is interesting, and the game itself lets you know that. At the end of every level is to remind you to watch the documentary, the game itself is steeped in vague symbolism and strange unexplained details that you'd understand if you (points at) watch the documentary. And that's fine except I was sold a game not a movie.  Meanwhile, the game itself is just so incredibly poorly done. The closer you look at it, the more you realise the holes that are in the platforming and the padding pushed into it. For a platformer, the jumping itself should be seamless and the movement (the thing that is the MOST IMPORTANT PART) is jerky, glitchy, and unclear. I died at several puzzles because I just did not know where I was expected to go and, best part, a lot of the time you're timed. I was being chased time and again and I had to take multiple leaps of faith on parts that might've been branches, might not have been. Sometimes a spirit platform would show up, sometimes no. I met my end at the bottom of many cliffs and frozen waters because that game was built on trusting your partner and the mechanics to work like they're supposed to (gusts of wind, platforms appearing out of nowhere)   My favorite part was when I was at the penultimate level and I could not get past a particular part not because it was difficult, but Nuna literally, could/would not, grab a hold of a wall at the end of a jump. I slid my face all the way down that wall and into a bed of spikes, and had to redo. In fact, I thought I broke it until I finally made it somehow without changing anything and then had to wrestle with the same pit of spikes but on a /higher/ leverage. You are never taught your limits because those limits were always changing. It was buggy and long, and i hope you liked doing it the first time because you're gonna have to do it a second time.  So, the short of it is, for a documentary, its wonderfully researched and very informative. As a game, I never before had so much frustration in one thing that I had to put it into words and now I guess I'm publishing it.",

            "review_text": "First things first, the game is short, but that's not a point against it. It's not over before it starts, and the pacing is okay. However, the game is interspersed with (optional, but constantly unlocking) videos explaining the culture of the people the game is based on.  As a cultural exploration, it's okay. Production values of the videos are fine, but the content is mildly interesting, not enthralling.  As a game, it's just not very good, or very fun. The mechanics can be finicky in a way that break not only with platforming conventions, but it's own rules. If you're climbing, you can jump backwards away from the surface by pushing away from the wall and hitting Jump. However, you can't jump backwards from a standing position. You have to turn around first. But, you can't just turn around, since if you even just tap a direction, you not only turn, but move in that direction, which changes your location and possibly makes it so you'll not longer be able to jump and grab the ledge you could have if only you could just jump backwards. Or just turn around without moving. Or if the ledge-magnetization was more forgiving (it's inconsistent).  You end up dying and returning to checkpoint (after a few seconds unskippable 'oh dear' cutscene from the other character) quite often, but rarely because you didn't know what to do, but because the game fails to execute on your intent. If the platforming was tight, I would have completed the game in even less time, and enjoyed it more. But despite a patch fixing some of the behavior, I doubt they'll fix the fundamental platforming to make it actually fun.  I think the people making this game enjoyed it a lot more than you'll enjoy playing it. Can't quite recommend it.",

I learned a lot about Iñupiat people. Not only did the game entertain me, but it educated me as well. And I must admit, that I didn't know about their existence before. The game's art design is really beautiful; a mix of cartoon style with scrimshaw influences is on the spot for this game.  But the game-play was a bit frustrating, sometimes I just wanted to leave the game. The bear cave for example; that part of the game is just annoying. Or bola aiming/throwing; dear God, that was frustrating.   Or later in game when Fox turns into a ghost, and then randomly buggers up, letting me die.   Or Nuna's randoms jumps into her death while I played with Fox. Other than that, the gameplay was satisfying.

I would have rather just listened to the remainder of the story and put it away.  The DLC adds a new mechanic (rock throwing; 2 if you count rowing but that doesn't add anything meaningful). The levels are much better designed with actual problems to solve as you progress, but I found the extremely slow move speed, overall lack of action, and no collectibles/reason to (or areas to) explore to be too slow for me. I lost interest before completing the DLC.   PROS: -Good way of introducing people to an otherwise unknown topic -A simple but acceptable story -Graphics are clean and look good, but are VERY simple.  -The fox's motions are extremely well done.   NEUTRALS: -Use of video clips (esp without the ability to seek) is interesting but questionable in execution.  CONS: -SLOW. Why is everything in the game so SLOW??? Walking, pulling ghosts, swimming, flying....its all super slow. -NUMEROUS game breaking glitches. I had to use the 'reset from last checkpoint' option several times because things that should be breaking just weren't breaking (esp during the polar bear sequence).  -Very SHORT game. My 3.1 hour is a 100% clear of the main game and about 1/3 of the DLC. If I had finished the DLC I probably would have been just shy of 4 hours total playtime (main game +DLC). -Very poor level design. Very little use of actual mechanics in the levels (except at the giant, near the end of the game). The vast majority of the game is just moving right with a trivial jump here and there. -Most of the game is a walking simulator. What little platforming there is is very simple. Almost no puzzles. -Crude controls lead to frustration every now and again. -Boss fight isn't a fight. Its simply trial and error until you figure out where you need to stand. You don't even need to move, just stand in the right position and he will miss you everytime. -No real collectibles or any reason to explore. (There are the videos but I got all of them on my playthrough without any attempts at exploration. One or two of them did require me to actually try to get them but it was very trivial). -Completely linear as a result of lack of exploration.",

            "review_text": "Never Alone was a great experience, and if I could classify it as something other than atmospheric puzzle-platformer, it would be as an interactive documentary and view into the cultural aspects that shape the Inupiaq people and their beliefs and way of life. The story itself is relatively simple: It is about a girl, Nuna, and her fox companion traveling to find the source of a mysterious blizzard, Since it is based off of a commonly told story, it's understandable there wouldn't be a strong emphasis on story twists or even on character development. It really does shine in incorporating a lot of different aspects of the Inupiaq culture into the game, however, and with this artistic choice it sets itself apart from other puzzle platformers. I enjoyed seeing a female protagonist, and a protagonist from a culture you would not usually see within video games. The art inspiration they drew from the art of the Inupiaq is also very apparent and delightfully different from what you might usually see.  Gameplay-wise, as a puzzle platformer you control either Nuna or the fox (with one person controlling each character in co-op). A lot of puzzles will require coordination of both, and the use of the spirits added a very interesting element to the gameplay by allowing you to manipulate and change how to traverse (this is apparent later in the game). I played with a controller, and the input felt very smooth, though I heard that keyboard users may find it a bit more difficult to play. It can be a bit confusing playing by yourself and forgetting which character you're controlling, but this is very minor compared to the overall scope of the game. However, when I was not controlling a character, they sometimes moved unfavorably, resulting in my having to restart from the last checkpoint, but to my understanding a patch was rolled out prior to this review that fixed this. There were also some glitches where characters got stuck in walls, which I think may have been fixed, but as of the time of this writing is something to keep in mind before purchasing.  I enjoyed my experience, and if you like learning about new cultures and some neat art design and puzzles, then I recommend picking this game up. If anything, it allowed a brief but insightful look into the culture of a people normally not represented in many works.",

Unfortunately though, this game failed to reach expectations and I got quite bored in the first hour of gameplay. I played the game alone so controlling and switching between the Fox and Nuna was quite bothersome. I often got frustrated at the puzzles mainly because playing alone is kind of glitchy (Fox follows Nuna if you are Nuna and Nuna follows Fox if you are Fox) so often times the character I  wasn't  controlling got hit by the obstacles, jumped/fell off the platform, etc.   The whole Bola thing was quite frustrating too. Not only is the aiming mechanism REALLY weird (you have to indicate where the Bola where go   JUST  with Nuna's arm suggestion), but Nuna PAUSES to aim the Bola and you are unable to throw the Bola while running. This resulted in me getting chased down by bosses and having to redo tasks over and over again. It's really upsetting I had to give this game a bad review, but it wasn't very fun for me.:(  I liked the characters, the history, and the soundtrack, but game style just wasn't for me. I only played for an hour or so by myself so it might be a completely different experience if you really get into it and if you play with another person. Overall, I give this game a 4/10 based off the first hour of gameplay (half of which was just me falling off platforms due to these glitches).",

The overarching strength of this game is its story, art, and the brief documentary videos, which can be watched during or between levels, or even skipped. The sound direction is also very well done. The weakness of the game are the sometimes clunky controls (I used the keyboard) and the simplistic gameplay. Had to restart due to a glitch once, and encountered a couple of game bugs.

The game also suffers from clunky player controls which in my experience is standard unity powered games (Is that the default player input script???). I want to support indies but make your game work!  Even if the bugs were fixed, the gameplay is quite boring. The platforming elements are lackluster and the game lacks any other mechanics asides from the bola to solve 'puzzles'. There's no variety, there's no gradual and continuous introduction of mechanics to keep me interested. You get all the tools you need within the first hour of the game and that's it.  The Pros: The artwork and theme is pretty nice. The educational snippits saved the game. I had something to work towards.

However, as a platformer / puzzler, it's mediocre. The controls are iffy (played on xbox 360 controller), the 'puzzles' are tedious with blatantly obvious solutions, and the mechanics are all pretty standard: jump on platforms, climb some stuff, jump off walls, etc. What actually makes this bad is the presence of two characters. Perhaps due to flaws in AI, sometimes the secondary character won't follow you, so you get to switch to them and do half the 'puzzles' twice. Other times, they will follow you when you actually need them to stand still for a puzzle (though I've only encountered this once). It seems to me a very simple follow me / stay here system would be infinitely easier. There's room on the d-pad and even more room on a keyboard.   An even bigger issue is that the game's story, it's cultural uniqueness being a selling point, does not transition well to the video game medium. Roughly speaking, the story is a Iñupiaq folktale. The problem is the gameplay itself does not help the story. Around the start of the game, the narrator says the girl and the fox formed a bond. I didn't feel that bond. I just met this fox a few minutes ago, and frankly, for the exact AI reasons I mentioned previously, it was more of a nuisance than anything else. Also, the cutscenes are in a different artstyle, which detracts from the experience somewhat. I can see why, most likely out of deference for the original folktale, but they seem to have taken the original folktale in its original state and then built the game around it, which was a grave mistake. If I wanted to hear a folktale, I could find plenty online, and they'd be just as interesting: I would't feel emotionally attached to the characters but would find the basic story interesting.   One possible reason for my negative experience with this is that I didn't watch the cultural insight videos, for two reasons. Firstly, I didn't want to be taken out of the experience. I understood the story completely, but maybe the novelty is in the learning and not in the game itself. Secondly, much like the folktale issue, if I wanted to watch a documentary, I'd watch one online.",

The simplicity in the art style and overall story helps sell this game as a must have. This game shows that there is no need for complex stories of betrayal and revenge. All you need to tell a good story is the combination of a believeable world and believeable characters. Never Alone exhibits these exceptionally with a warm and caring approach with the narration tracking the player's progress throughout the game. The stylistic approach is beautiful and the transitional sections provide a wonderful view into how stories are actually presented by the Iñupiat.  I bought this game purely out of fascination for the Inuit people in general. I was curious to know more. This game did not dissapoint. If you want to know more about these amazing people as they etch out a living on the ice, be sure to get this game. You will find yourself falling in love with how beautiful their holistic way of life is. This game is a truly amazing experience and is worth every cent.  Now for the scores:  Story: 95/100 Visuals: 95/100 Gameplay: 85/100 Soundtrack: 90/100  Overall Rating: 92/100",

But then I have been playing Rayman Origins lately so maybe that prepared me.   You navigate some antarctic areas with your little fox buddy who I honestly cared about more than the girl. I just got annoyed whenever she died, my heart broke evry time the fox cried out though... cute, little, fluffy, white ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!  It probably works better in co-op but it played just fine on my own. You also unlock these neat little interviews clips with some of the... um, people. I forget what thems were called but normally I don't give one ♥♥♥♥ about culture and for some reason this really interested me. Having forced my way through a particular supremely over rated game recently this was a nice break. It only took me a few hours to finish the main bit but I'm a firm believer that condensed awesomeness is better than dragged out mediocrity. Hell, MGS V dragged out a reasonable amount of awesomeness to become painstakingly ♥♥♥♥. Even 6 hour campaign is still thrice the length of a movie.  Ignore my playtime, I played most of this offline, I'm halfway through Foxtales now.

BUT, as a gamer I still want to rate this as a game, and in that I find it lacking. The story is mildly interesting, but really is not very deep. This is a linear platformer, and much of the time this is implemented quite well, but there are moments where frustration gets hold, and repeated attempts are the only way to try to figure out what the game wants the player to do. Luckily though, the autosave points are never very far, so it is fairly tolerable to repeat the mistakes. Finally, the main game is very short (took me three hours), which in this context can be a good thing, but not if you paid the full price.",

You get to hear from the people themselves and their stories and struggles with living at the top of the world.  The music is also astounding, moving and just about perfect in brewing the right emotion for each moment of the game. My only real frustration with the games were playing with a mouse and keyboard and some of the more challenging portions requiring qucik timing between the two characters...well it made replaying quick portions on a couple of occassion more than a dozen times a little bit rage inducing. Still the checkpoints were fair and not too far apart at all and may not have been a big deal at all for people more ace with platformers or having the benifit of a controller.

I finished this game not because I really enjoyed it, but just because I wanted it finished.  The platforming was not really a challenge and required little skill or thought. In the three hours or so it took to finish the main game and the 'Foxtales' DLC, the only times I felt challenged were because the controls were not responsive enough or the other AI-controlled character jumped off of a ledge, causing more rage than enjoyment in these parts. If you're looking for solid platforming, look somewhere else. Also, The story and the characters were semi-forgettable. It was not really a bad story, just not something I 'got into.'  However, as an educational experience, this game did manage to provide an window into the culture of the Inupiat. The collectible 'insights' explained various details relating to parts of the story. If this is what you are looking for, the game may be worth it, but I can't recommend it on gameplay alone.    *TL;DR*  This game is not worth it for the platforming, but the story and the cultural background might make it worth it for some people.   Gameplay - 4/10 Story - 7/10 Educational Value - 9/10 Overall - 6/10 Value for price - $15 is a lot for 3 hours of gameplay. If I were considering buying this game, I'd definitely wait for a sale.

Throughout the game, which takes about 2 to 2.5 hours to go from start to finish, the player will also be exposed to other bits of folk lore, from the Little People (a group of mischievous, super strong humanoids), Manslayer (a person who puts their greed and selfish desires before the community), Sky People, nature spirits, and more.  At times controls can feel stiff and there are a few moments where you will miss a jump or fall off a ledge due to this. Had they put in a little more work towards this, I think the game would have been much more rewarding to players and less frustrating.  I think the art-style of the game was a very good choice. Cut scenes also mix in animated tribal art and figures, which help keep the tone and mood throughout the game. Living in the praries of Canada, we get our fair share of blizzards and wind storms, and Never Alone does a good job depicting the blizzard in the game in both animation and sound.  One of the things few mention about this game is that it also has mini-documentaries which are unlocked as you go through the game. There are 24 in total, lasting only a couple minutes each, and can be played in the middle of a game when you unlock one, or after through the main menu. I found playing these short documentaries during the game actually added to it, as they would have something to do with the lore of the level you were in. Some of these documentaries are about the lore of the indiginous people (such as about the Sky People), while others were more practical (like how skin of the cariboo from different seasons were used for specific clothing).

The artwork and enviroment are stunning, the plot and concept are interesting, the gameplay is a bit frustrating at times, but it's nothing unbearable.   My only real complaint was when I tried to play the game before, it had too many glitches that rendered the game nearly unplayable at some parts. It turns out for this game, I needed to set my computer's settings to 'high performance' instead of normal. That got rid of the game breaking glitches, though there are still a few (unfair death at one part, a glow that doesn't disappear when it should) but nothing that majorly impacted the game play.",

As it is set in what I guess is Alaska, it has a metric ton of ice physics. This makes the controls feel extremely slippery and nonresponsive, and in a game with as much platforming as this, that's extremely hard to deal with.

I'm gonna start with the BAD, this game disappointed me a tiny bit. now the bad things im about to say might only have affected me but i wanna say it just to say. This game is a little hard, i found myself dying and seeing the fox or girl luna morning over and over and over. The cause of all my deaths was mainly my keybored delay, the keys have a 1 second or 2 second delay(this might not seem like a big deal but when ur getting chased an you have to time your jump to live, its a big deal.) so the controls are a bit weird. However the game gives you NO direction i mean most of the time all you do is run away from who is trying to kill you and most of this game was going to point A to point B but once you get to point B they sometimes give you a little puzzle to solve, and these puzzles are pretty dang hard which i like, i mean its a good challange. but when you give me no direction on where to go or any hints on what to do its a little too hard and you have to die ALOT just to get passes a puzzle or even find out where to go next after you've completed half the puzzle. and in these puzzles you might have you knock down some ice with a bola you get soon into the game. But guess what? YOU CAN'T ♥♥♥♥ING AIM THE BLOA! i mean luna(the girl) kinda sticks her arm out to inticate where it might go but ♥♥♥♥ i had to try and hit a thing of ice like 4 times before i finally got it. So the game doesn't really tell you what to do, i guess it might be fun for some but when you've died about 5 times and you've only gotten like 25% done with the puzzle it gets annoying.  Also the settings arent the best, i only had 2 quailty options which where low and high. either way the game looks amazing but it kinda got me annoyed i couldnt have more options. the game did have some minor clipping issues but i guess its tolerable. If you're gonna buy this game to play alone, be ready for a challange! i recommend playing co-op. co-op makes this game sooo much better cuz the A.I is not very smart, they will fall of ledges or be too far away or too close its just a pain sometimes. anyway im gonna leave some other bad stuff out because i forgot them and i just wanna tell you the GOOD. This game is beautiful with nice graphics and amzing atmosphere this game has an amazing display of color and wonder. Luna has a very good character, they displayed her character well but the fox? mehhhh just a friendly white fox(thats what i got from the foxes character i dont know 100% about him sorry) the story telling is amazing with a story book cutsene and a navite language narrator(pls turn on subtitles) the plot is well said from the narrator and its just really nice. Through out your gameplay you run past owls that unlock videos to play if you want, and i like to play them because they are really nice and woderful to watch i won't really talk about them tho, you can see them yourself. Now going back to the puzzles, they werent all bad and yes they are very hard but it test your mind or teamwork and i love it. they are mostly very diverse and are even beautiful puzzles to look at.  Over all this gave was made with passion and you can really see the passion, its hard but its a nice challage. I give this game a 8/10 :D",

But it doesn't take much for some of the physics to start becoming wonky. I have had my character been slingshotted and turned into ragdoll elastic due to some combination being too near a ledge and environmental hazard. At one point the girl could barely move on a small platform because she got locked into the 'teetering' animation when she got too near the ledge. At the same time I was suppose to dodge homing fireballs with only that ledge. The animation overrode my movement commands.  Stages were sometimes hit or miss. Some stages meshed very well with the story, such as the one in the living forest. Others are like the the stage within the whale. Nothing about the environment's design or gameplay reflected the fact I was in a whale. Only the next cutscene saying 'I got blown through its blowhole' to the outside.  Overall, the cultural insights, videos and story contained with in the game are important to preserve and for us to see.  But the game itself may not have been the best possible medium.

Rarely do games choose to adapt stories like this, often sticking to much more well known mythologies (Greek, Roman, etc).

This game is not fun. It doesn't feel good. It doesn't work right most of the time. It's rarely clear what you're ever supposed to be doing. I'm not sure at what point I actually hated playing it, but this game will soon wear on you with it's incredibly poor craftsmenship. You'll fall into pits you shouldn't have, you'll clip through walls, you'll get stuck in midair a lot, and you'll die when you're AI controlled companion can't navigate correctly. It's really hard to recommend this game on ANY level. If you really want to learn about the stories in this game, just go read them.

A friend of mine is an Alaskan Native and I'd always been interested in the culture since I met her, and this game certainly does not dissapoint on that.  I had issues when first trying to start the game, but after updating my graphics drivers I was good to go - though I had to play in low quality. This is apprently a common issue with anyone playing with Windows - even windows 8.1 like myself - so keep that in mind if you're purchasing without a high level graphics card.  Anyhow far as gameplay goes, I haven't had nearly as many issues as everyone else. I've found the jumping responsive, the borra pretty easy to manage, and the other keyboard controls work fine. I haven't used a controller, so I can't speak for anyone who plans on that, but keyboard is just fine.   The only issues I've had is when you have to make the fox fly and press shift to move the spirits. That can get a bit tedious and annoying, but I also have very short fingers so it's quite a reach for me to keep pressing the shift while guiding with the other fingers. (I know this won't make much sense, but it's due to the fact I dont wish to reveal part of the story).  As for the enviroment, it's lovely. Even on low the graphics are quite nice, and the variety they can create with a rather limited setting is admirable. The ice caves - especially inside the whale - are very pretty. Playing the game kind of made me wanna drink hot chocolate.   I find the story great. It is a classic Native Alaskan tale (I say Native Alaskan because I can't spell the word for the life of me) about a girl, a blizzard, and a special little fox. There are subtitles to read while the storyteller tells the story in the native language. Very enjoyable to listen too. The lack of highly descriptive words makes it all feel more ...true, persay.  As for Nuna (the girl) and the fox, I love them. Neither ever says a word, but through playing them both on singleplayer I kind of get the feel of the connection they have. Nuna needs the fox, and the fox needs Nuna. Neither can survive without the other, each stage requiring them to help one another in many ways. This will especially be enjoyable if you have the ability to play co-op.  And the historical videos that you unlock on the way are maybe a minute long and all very, very interesting. It details how the natives lived, what they ate, how they dressed, played, their beliefs and spirits and everything else, all from various generations of Native Alaskans.   All in all I highly reccomend this game, especially for the sale price. Some people say it's a bit short, but I'm not finding it that way.",

            "review_text": " What's it about?   Never Alone (Kisima Ingithuna)  is a 2.5D puzzle platformer based around Alaska Native stories and culture. You play as Nuna, a young Alaska Native girl, and Fox, her four-legged vulpine friend (I call him Pat) as they journey across the tundra and ice floes of Alaska in their quest to uncover the source of the savage blizzards that are threatening their very existance.   How does it play?  As previously mentioned, the game is a 2.5D platformer, by which I mean it takes place on a 2D plane with backgrounds in full 3D. It can be played in local co-op, with one player controlling Nuna and the other handling Fox, or single-player with the player switching between the characters at the touch of a button.  The puzzles are not too difficult, though they do take a few tries to get right, and they use the environment well. Each character has their own set of skills that you uncover as you progress through the game. Nuna can push heavy objects and throw a magical bola to destroy ice barriers, while Fox can scramble up high walls, perform wall jumps and get the spirits of the land to help you out.  The game has some AI problems, with the character you're not controlling sometimes doing some stupid things like casually hopping off a platform or forgetting to brace in the wind. These problems were apparently worse at launch and a patch has since addressed some of the issues, but it is not perfect. The platforming also feels a little bit heavy, which makes sense when you consider the characters are not superbeings. I prefer platforming to be more dynamic, but this is just personal taste. Nuna's bola is also awkward to aim when using a controller, since you have to tilt the right thumbstick away from and then towards your target. I didn't play with mouse and keyboard, but the game apparently works just fine with them.   How does it look?   Never Alone  runs on the Unity engine, so it should run just fine on any system. Its a lovely-looking game, with glistening ice and whirling snow bringing the harsh landscape to life, aided by good-quality textures. Animation quality is somewhat lacking, but the character models have a pleasingly cartoony look to them and fur is pretty well rendered on Nuna's coat and Fox's body.  Cutscenes between stages are animated in a traditional native art style, which made me think of shadow puppet plays. While I respect what they were trying to achieve, I ultimately thought that these looked a lot worse than the game itself, and actually detatched me from the experience. I think the cutscenes would have been better had they been done in the game engine but, again, this is down to personal preference.   How does it sound?  The narrator delivers the story in his native tongue (I don't know what it's called, forgive my ignorance) with a voice that seems to carry the wisdom of thousands of years. It is not reactive in the way that  Bastion  was, but does a good job of giving relevance to your actions and progress. The music grants the game a feeling of loneliness and isolation that makes me think of the Phendrana Drifts zone in the Gamecube classic  Metroid Prime , and the howling winds of the blizzards are brilliantly realised. You can almost feel the biting cold as each gust of wind threatens to send you flying over an edge or aides you in crossing a wide chasm.   Long story short   Never Alone  is a lovely game. It is only a couple of hours long, yet it seems to be just the right length; not outstaying its welcome but not leaving the player gagging for more. The AI could have done with just a little more tweaking and a couple of glitches could be fixed (there were a couple of times when I clipped through a wall or across a gap), but the experience of the game is one to savour. There are several videos that give you some insight into the Alaska Native culture, which you can view ingame after finding them (I recommend you wait until you've finished the game before viewing them). Overall,  Never Alone  is by no means perfect, but is a heartwarming tale, ideal for the cold winter nights ahead.",

Very frustrating, died more than 10 times in a matter of less than 15 minutes. Apart from that, the art is good and story seems interesting, very buggy controls.

The environments look fantastic. These thing really made me want to like the game.  But the game is awfully buggy, and kinda ruined a lot of moments for me. As I got closer to the end, I felt like I was doing a chore. I was just finishing the game for the sake of reaching the end. The bugs were so frustrating, I eventually started fuming, literally. When I want to jump onto a platform, I glitch my way too far and fall to my death. When I want to jump to a ladder, I don't grab on, and I fall to a spot farther back. There are also a few moments where the controls wouldn't respond like I want them to. And the game doesn't have very good AI, so a character sometimes won't jump to another platform unless you take control.  Another problem is a lot of the moments where you have to switch back and forth between you and Foxy. At the end of the game, it was so frustrating how fast I had to get away from danger, while constantly having to switch between characters, and trying to do several things at once. It sometimes caused me to die from either falling or the danger catching up with me. That kind of thing gave me the idea that this game was probably MEANT to be played by two people.  But a lot of the more anger-inducing moments started when Foxy changed to his second form. He moves like a frigging sloth, and speeding him up doesn't make moving around any easier. But this is where the real problems of having to switch characters begin.  I really want to recommend it, I really do. It looks fantastic, the story is great, the characters are great, but the gameplay is what stands between me and a good time. So I'm afraid I can't. Unless the bugs can be fixed, you can just avoid this game... unless you think you can look past all the bugs and glitches, then kudos to you. I sincerely hope you have fun.  Also I really don't like Foxy's second form. But what's done is done, so whatever.",

I couldn't even get myself to finish it, but let me tell you why.  - Terrible AI that consistantly dies on it's own causing you to go back to the previous checkpoint.  - Awful sluggish movement and platforming. Which is a problem because this game is a platformer at heart. Its just not fun to play. - Glitches and bugs. Had myself fall through the floor in a boss fight. Polar bear got stuck. AI walking off random edges to its death. - As much as it is story focused, it completely lost my interest. This is probably more because of the gameplay making me frustrated and ruining the story. - The narration sometimes cut's off if you go too far ahead. Meaning you miss some of the story. - Repetative. - This game is meant to be played Co-op. Controlling two characters on your own is a chore and you have to fight to get them to do what you want.  - Bland graphics and art style. Sure the designs of the spirits are interesting but everything else seems...meh. - Not once did i stop and just look at the world they created. In a game like this, where it is more about the world and story/ Puzzle solving, there should be some 'wow' moments. Not once. There are much better games similar to this one which do have those (Braid, Limbo, Ori, Contrast, Trine etc). - Forgettable soundtrack. - It can't make up it's mind if water kills you or not. Freezing water kills you. 30 mins later you can swim in the freezing water (You can't even drown). Then only five minuites after a section where you can swim water kills you again. It makes no sense.  In conclusion, i feel that Never Alone is a great premise which fell short due to clunky controls, design and execution. It's just not fun to play. It's a game that isn't fun to play. Disappointing.",

            "review_text": "I first read about this game in an issue of Game Informer and decided immediately I wanted to play it. A friend of mine is an Alaskan Native and I'd always been interested in the culture since I met her, and this game certainly does not dissapoint on that.  I had issues when first trying to start the game, but after updating my graphics drivers I was good to go - though I had to play in low quality. This is apprently a common issue with anyone playing with Windows - even windows 8.1 like myself - so keep that in mind if you're purchasing without a high level graphics card.  Anyhow far as gameplay goes, I haven't had nearly as many issues as everyone else. I've found the jumping responsive, the borra pretty easy to manage, and the other keyboard controls work fine. I haven't used a controller, so I can't speak for anyone who plans on that, but keyboard is just fine.   The only issues I've had is when you have to make the fox fly and press shift to move the spirits. That can get a bit tedious and annoying, but I also have very short fingers so it's quite a reach for me to keep pressing the shift while guiding with the other fingers. (I know this won't make much sense, but it's due to the fact I dont wish to reveal part of the story).  As for the enviroment, it's lovely. Even on low the graphics are quite nice, and the variety they can create with a rather limited setting is admirable. The ice caves - especially inside the whale - are very pretty. Playing the game kind of made me wanna drink hot chocolate.   I find the story great. It is a classic Native Alaskan tale (I say Native Alaskan because I can't spell the word for the life of me) about a girl, a blizzard, and a special little fox. There are subtitles to read while the storyteller tells the story in the native language. Very enjoyable to listen too. The lack of highly descriptive words makes it all feel more ...true, persay.  As for Nuna (the girl) and the fox, I love them. Neither ever says a word, but through playing them both on singleplayer I kind of get the feel of the connection they have. Nuna needs the fox, and the fox needs Nuna. Neither can survive without the other, each stage requiring them to help one another in many ways. This will especially be enjoyable if you have the ability to play co-op.  And the historical videos that you unlock on the way are maybe a minute long and all very, very interesting. It details how the natives lived, what they ate, how they dressed, played, their beliefs and spirits and everything else, all from various generations of Native Alaskans.   All in all I highly reccomend this game, especially for the sale price. Some people say it's a bit short, but I'm not finding it that way.",

            "review_text": "I got this at an 80% discount, which I now kinda regret so I'll be shelling out for the DLC. It's a really beautiful game. I didn't encounter any hiccups with the controls (except for some time-based sections that are irritating to play single-player since the NPC doesn't always realize to AVOID threats), the story kept me invested despite a few (obviously cultural) narrative quirks, and it's absolutely the kind of game I'll replay just for the pleasure of it. One aspect that I really like about games like this is controlling two characters who are looking after one another, so if you find that really annoying then this might not be the game for you, but bear in mind the AI is mostly spot on. I only occasionally needed to switch around because one or the other was struggling with an obstacle, and there are only one or two onscreen at once so it never felt obnoxious to me since it could take several screens before a problem even occurred. I mostly controlled Nuna, because I got the impression that the fox's AI was more flexible, and it turned out to be a mostly smooth playthrough.  My only major criticism is in late game when the gameplay changes up a bit. It's a natural evolution of the mechanics, but I just didn't like it. (Major spoilers follow:)   I was really glad that my fox pal wasn't dead, but it was almost hard to be happy about that when his controls were so different and, for me, much harder to control. For one, his ability to manipulate the environment, which had been automatic before, was now tediously under my control--which I understand for branches I have to move in specific directions, but not for the orbs that had effortlessly followed him in his fox form or platforms that moved along a specific path according to how close or far away he was. I probably wouldn't have been as annoyed with this if he and his ability were easier to direct.    Regardless, I otherwise especially loved the first part of the game and look forward to Foxtales.",

            "review_text": "I like to think that this game is a complement to the video and not the other way around because the game itself is clearly not memorable and lacking in some ways. Let me describe what made me think that way  1. Bugs The game is buggy, I went past barrier several times and resulted in death and sometimes I could walk in an invisible platform  2. AI is stupid Playing this in single mode sucks ball. There was a time when I play as the girl and standing at the edge of cliff and then the fox run towards me and pushed me down below. Another time the fox would walk too far away from me when I'm riding the spirit which obviously resulted in death  3. Aiming is hard I hate using bola, there's no cue as to where it would go. I hope there's something to mark the trajectory of where it would go or at least a glow on the surface of where it would land. But no, I just have to use my instinct to guess. This system is especially upsetting when every failed attempt to use the bola mean one step closer to death like when you're being chased by the bear in the early game.  So yeah, this is not a game with documentary. It's a documentary with a game, that's why I'm still giving a thumb up   TL;DR Pros: +Nice atmosphere +Decent puzzle +Cute fox  Cons: -AI is quite stupid -Buggy -Stupid aiming system",
