Core features like roof slopes are missing and the libary of constuction elements is extremely small,  If you plan to use this software to plan your new flat or apartment it might just work fine. For a whole house i recommend using another software with more features.",

Weight off chest being able to picture exactly what your planned room is going to look like before actually having to move in and deal with the rearranging of items. Helped me out a lot.",

I use a mix of keyboard/mouse and touchscreen devices. Despite it being easier on a keyboard and mouse, the touchscreen use in this app still worked inuitively. The application is not for professional use, despite some reviewers writing reviews as if it was. Granted the application is not perfect and the choice of furnishings and objects is lacking heavily with minimal choices. However, this app is a life-saver when redesigning a room or a house and beats the old pencil and paper method as the digital version can be shared across devices through steam and screenshot images.  I have used this application on multiple projects at redesigning rooms and at work and it has impressed many people.",
