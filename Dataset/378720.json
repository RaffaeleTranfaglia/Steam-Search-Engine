            "review_text": "I usually don't write reviews, this might be the first one I do on Steam. What makes be 'break the silence' is the pleasant and extraordinary surprise I had playing the game.  I never heard of it until a couple of days ago(two days before release), I wasn't hyped and never heard about the company before.   So imagine my surprise when I started playing the game:  Fully random world each time you play, no handmade scenarios, no premade campaign. Sound scary no? On the contrary, they manage to pull it off. Each world is beautifully generated, no odd stating points or placement of terrain etc. Each game you play is unique.  New lore: It's Slavic (or so they say) folklore. Is that enough to differentiate the game lore from the generic fantasy games out there? Yes it is. Just enough to keep you interested and too much that you have no idea what those creatures are and you have to either take notes or take random action against them.  No legion of units to manage, each unit is one piece, it has more skills and abilities that any RPG I've played and when they die, it's forever and you really feel it. Not just because you cared for them but because it brutally handicaps you. You can't recruit units when you want to. If you're not careful and build enough of the right buildings you don't even have enough units to survive(gather resources and defend).  All that micromanagement of units and building might sound scary but you only get one settlement in the game. That's right, you won't have a ton of cities, legions of units. No sir, one is all you get. The world (planet) is trying to kill you. Only once have I experienced this feeling and that was while playing Alpha Centauri (SMAC).  A multitude of ways to defeat your enemies (aside from fighting).  A unique card based combat system that is actually fun to play.  Hundreds and events and quests that remind me of King of the Dragon Pass.  All that originality for 15-20 euro. And coming from a small indies studio. My hat off to the devs. And a recommendation to anyone reading this to try the game. It's more than worth the price and time to learn the game (about one hour for me). ",

            "review_text": "This is a really interesting game!  It really is mostly a rogue-like. However at it's core it is a turn based strategy game, not an RPG. You have a town, but it is not a 4x game as such. From what I see you only have the 1 town. Some of your people are gatherers, some are soldiers, some are crafters. You send the soldiers out to kill stuff, send gatherers with them if you want to gather as well. People are sent out in 'expeditions'. The main resources here are food and fuel (for fire). All the other resources are basically optional, and used for crafting or putting up buildings in your town.  Technology is very simply done (but it works well). Choose weapons technology, get powerful ingredients and make amazing items. Or use tech to unlock more buildings and follow the growth path to victory.  Combat is done unusually. Your units are placed as cards, enemy units are also cards. Some cards are attack and some are support (chosen randomly). The idea is to try and set up the best order of the cards before combat begins. The combat has a lot of depth, watching a video to figure it out is a good idea.  The game is very complex, especially figuring out how combat works. At the same time it is slow and almost relaxing game, until you watch your people die horribly and fail :(   7/10 would die horribly again",

            "review_text": "TL:DR - If Dungeons and Dragons and Expeditions Conquistator had a love child, this would be it (but with more polish and better execution than EC).  I recommend Thea: The Awakening if you enjoy survival, rogue games, mythology and/or strategy games.  Full review:  You start with a group of people, there are different classes, each with their own skill sets. You can split your group and send out expeditions to explore, collect resources, complete quests and battle enemies. You cannot build any other towns, so I would call Thea a 3x strategy. You grow via your people and the crafting system, not via the number of cities built. It forced me and my merry band of survivors out into the world, risking their lives each time, which I loved.   There are lots of quests and random events that move the story forward. The random events also ensure that even in late game, you can lose one or more of your beloved crew. Some people have complained that some events are too harsh and unfairly punish a player. I agree, there are a few of these but the developers did add a reload function, so it is up to the player if they want to accept a massive loss or reload. The game keeps trying to **** you right 'til the end and I will always choose that over mindlessly pressing 'next turn' over and over with nothing to do but wait for the victory screen to appear.   The card-based combat system is not one I have encountered before. At the beginining this was one of my least favourite features. The early battles are way too simplistic for my tastes, but as time went on, I enjoyed it much more. By the time I was fighting battles with 20 odd cards on each side, there was a lot more strategy involved and I often feared for the fate of my people.  The crafting system is fun, has thousands of items and feeds directly into the combat system. Your characters will level up as they gain experience but you can add huge boosts to stats if you choose the right combination of items to equip them with.   Slavic mythology is also something new to me...and I loved it. There is so much atmosphere in the world of Thea, creatures, events, beasts and magic and I got sucked right in. For anyone interested in mythology, this title is a must.   I could rave about Thea some more but my boyfriend said I was bordering on rambling, so I'll just say this...you get a lot for your money at full price. If you're still unsure, try the demo or pick it up on sale, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty original and hits all the right buttons: It's addictive, fun and challenging with a high replay value.  It's basicly a roguelike 3X game. Why not 4X you ask? Because it only has the eXplore, eXploit and eXterminate parts. There is a very small part of eXpand in that you build up your main settlement and attract new villagers, but you are restricted to one village and can't expand its borders like in for instance Civilization or Age of Wonders.  You play as a re-awakened god or goddess in the world of Thea, which is just recovering from an era of utter darkness. Your goal is to help the few people who still kept their faith in you survive and rebuild what they've lost while also trying to figure out what happened in the world that caused this darkness.  At the beginning, the game seems pretty restricted and simple because of the missing of the 4th X: You build weapons, armor and buildings with the materials that your expedition brings home, which in turn generates research which unlocks new materials, buildings and crafting recipes.  However, after you horribly fail the first few attempts, you start to notice how deep the game actually is. Do you want one large expeditionary force or multiple smaller ones? If you bring along a lot of gatherers in your expeditions, you can rapidly collect that valuable steel, but your wood and vegetable production in your village will suffer.  The game is also very clever in the way it handles conflicts. Most conflicts can be resolved in a number of ways depending on your expedition composition. You can not only fight a pack of wolves traditionally, but you can also opt to hunt them if you've got a few people with the proper hunting skillset. If you have a few intelligent people with herbalism and medicine skills, you can choose to just set traps for the wolves with poisoned meat.  These conflicts (named Challenges by the game) are all played out using a card game that is part luck and part skill. I'd say it is more skill-based than Hearthstone for instance. The cards are the people in your expedition (or village, if it's under attack) and the stats and abilities on those cards are determined by the type of encounter.  During fights, the Damage statistic (which is mostly determined by strenght and the damage of your equipped weapon) will determine, you've guessed it, the amount of damage a card can do. However, during social challenges, damage is determined by the character's Speech skill. That beefy warrior with the giant two-handed axe can suddenly be completely useless if you're trying to convince a group of slave traders to let go of their cargo.  It's a very interesting system and it makes party composition extremely important, as you never know what's around the corner.  When you (inevitably) meet your demise, you are awarded a score based on all that you've done and the difficulty modifier. This score is then added to the experience of the god you've used, unlocking extra passive abilities. When any god reaches level 3, you will unlock a new god with a different playstyle. I enjoy this system, it gives a sense of progression and although the gods' abilities seem subtle at first, they have quite an impact on the way you play.  Additional things that I like are the art style used (the cards are very pretty), the music and the setting. You will encounter very unusual creatures that you may sometimes recognise from the Witcher series, as both games take inspiration from the same mythology.  All in all, I highly recommend this game, it's a lot of bang for your buck. And you will think about what you did wrong that cost you that precious Crafter's life long after you've shut down the game.",

Your expedition and your settlement experience frequent random events Oregon Trail style(some brutal). The scope of how awesome this game is cannot be encompassed in a review, play the demo.  At the end of my last game I had a rabid bear, two malicious spiders, and a goblin worker working side by side to make sandwiches and defend my base. My party was joined by five elves one after the other. The poor children though, so many get taken or eaten by witches.  Also, the combat mechanic is great and original.",

            "review_text": "Game has a really great idea and future. Wanted to give some tips from my point of view to make it great: 1.randomize monster compositions(cannot emphasize enough how important this one is!!!) After only 5 hours into roguelike game I can list all monster comps and tactics against them. Simplest way to do this is army strength. This one really ruins the game 2.make it so if you have more than 95% chance to beat monster in any way you can you get the loot automatically and not forced to click auto-resolve for 2 hours untill monsters become stronger 3.while different types of challenges are great their variety ruins it a bit as well (you will never try to make a talking or a sneaking party coz you just don't have enough men to spread so thin) If your warriors have some additional stats - great, if not - you won't bother. 4.the stats on weapons need to be way higher to make sense, otherwise you just pick the highest damage and variety of weapons falls from 2000 to 5(this actually clicks great with my previous point - you will never give a character a will weapon for example coz you can't will-solve all problems but you can fight-solve almost all so you always pick damage) 5.is it me or constructions except well are useless? For example you will never ever need smithy - one crafter is more than enough for making key items, you can find the rest on your adventures. Same with watchtower - by the time you build it your adventurers will already explore that much. Same with medical tent - you will never make it to town. Maybe last one should give you a doctor on the next baby born? 6. add hotkeys and hotkey list - this is a roguelike(not important but easy and will make game better) 7.side-materials like darkwood are useless cos it's always better to unlock elvenwood and they are the same? 8.Maybe for the sake of making characters for the challenge when a baby is born you can make a sacrifice to Gods so it receives stats you need? For example you give 5 rubies so it receives higher chance of getting bigger strength. 9. Need to add option of receiving a doctor(maybe sacrifice as well) They are key party members. 10. Main point - death of party member almost in any case means game-over. Newborns cannot compete with stronger monsters. If this is core of game design you need to make medicine abundant and add medical - challenge to save lives. Otherwise blind chance can ruin your game, while you can do nothing. 11.Dunno if it's me but making different kinds of food is not worth sending x expeditions to gather them all? Better send second group of warriors to move slower but explore more.",

In this case case the second layer is a card game which comes up when your party is in a fight.  Music is good, GUI is simple to understand and easy to use and addional artwork (painted pictures) is added to the storyline and quests. Unlike a lot of modern games this one feels really crafted .  The game itself, however, is heavly dependant upon the random diceroll. You either tie yourself to the up and downs of random game encounters, random skill level up, random quest reward, random start postion ressource seeding and random card play opening ...... and then the game can be impossible hard sometimes. Or you just reroll /reload the game to avoid negative game encounters.  This is my main concern / critique on 'Thea: The Awakening'. Maybe the players desire 'to reload upon negative event' can be battled by ingame tools to reduce/improve the odds ?",

When I saw the screenshots I thought it was to good to be true and skeptical as I am I start reading the game info. Fantasy setting: check. Turn-based: check. Random maps: check.  Price: check....20 bucks? For an indie game? Did I have to wait for discount? hmmmmm..... Since this game combines two of my most favorite genres and start to look some let's plays on YT I was sure I need to have this game now. And I did not regret I paid full price for a game. This game. The artwork is really beatiful and since 15 years I really like to see some devs takes an original approach in their game. At the moment of writing I don't have much hours in the game. It is like delicious food. You don't want to eat everything at once. With this game I have the same feeling. I own the game now and still like just to read about the game and watch other people playing. I don't want this experience is over too soon so I play with patience and wait a bit till it's updated to a more stable version so I don't miss any important changes.  The tutorial is very well done by integrated it as a story inside the game. If you played it once and you want a new start you don't have to do the tutorial again. Also you can reset your progress when you want or create another profile.  The artwork is really nice. The landscape and unit models are all made with love and the basic, very well done, design of the cards is very nice to let it feel like an old board/card game.  Every part of the game is made with a lot of attention. Everything is made of different layers. You have loads of items, resources you can combine and craft. Lot's of unit stats and many different styles of how to play the game.  It's a great idea to not have all the 'gods' unlocked at the start of the game. It really give you some extra goal to play the game to unlock new content while you are playing.  This review is just to say to all my friends who like strategy/turnbased/4x games and are in for a very original fighting/diplomacy system in a card game form to buy this game.  If I know how to exactly play the game and find out all the different gameplay possibilities I extend my review in a more seriuous one game play wise. For now I just want to say how happy I am with this game and look forward for any DLC they want to make for this game because I buy them without doubt.  Thank you devs! Did I say the artwork is really nice?  ---Update after a few days---  I'm more and more excited about the game after playing it now more then 10 hours. I don't even have enough space to write everything I wanted. For me the game can compare easiliy with my 3 classics of lifetime and that is the first time in ten years I say something about a game. This is what I was waiting for since Heroes III, Disciples II, Age of Wonders and now there is Thea: The Awakening.  While it's very different then that games listed (graphics are 2015 standard) it give me the same feeling of love for a game.  The fact is that every game you start is a new adventure with so many different items, fights and challenges that it keeps you hooked for hours after hours even before knowing how to play well and start to read about stats and configure your party as best as possible.  Same for the card game. While I was skeptical at first how well this would work i'm impressed.  It's challenging, random but fair and after your card draw even when it's bad you have change to win the fight. PC character don't have hidden profits or invisible buffs. It's just how it is and not frustrating at all even when you loose.  Is the game really that perfect? It is! But with room for improvement on map navigation. Maps are huge and finding important places back is a real survival itself. More diversity in starting town is welcome. More content (it's only 4400 objects now) is welcome. Interface can have some improvements (lot of useless clicks sometimes). Show movement rate on different terrain. Make it possible in the future to let an expedition make a kind of outpost to hide fog of war in area where build and let you manage some resources from there. Those are my suggestions.  In the time playing I had 3 big updates. Devs respond within hours on the forum and are very passionate and kind.  Game gets better when you play more. Too much to discover in just a few hours time. They added Amazing huge maps, Iron mode, difficulty options are the best list I saw in any game, almost no bugs I found while it's still EA.  I'm really amazed. I give this a 10/10 because I want to have some space left for the 11/10 because the devs promissed us free DLC and event editor in the future.",

I do, however, want to give credit to these guys, as I hope they have great success with this title, they certainly deserve it.  I think this is the kind of experience I, brad wardell, and the rest of stardock were hoping Elemental would become during its early development. This game has such a cohessive and well thought out set of mechanics it generates its own very real tension, challenge, and personality. Where many games end up being more or less a facade; asking the player to care, but not really giving them a reason to -the product of a designe philosophy focussing too much on goals, and less on how to actually achieve them. Thea seems to have been built from the ground up off good ideas, and has developed them to their great potential to create something with substance.  I can't say for sure whether you'll like it, you may not. But if you're looking at it and thinking it's the kind of thing you're interested in, take my word that it is extremely well implemented and realized. I am proud of the developers for doing such a good job, and wish them success.",

The distinct nature of resources is handled well, and the random availability thereof actually makes for a surprising amount of replayability. The card / battle system is a little bit opaque, not so much because of the actual mechanics involved, but because there are so many statistics that each influence different types of combat in different ways, it's hard to keep track of who will be good at what sort of combat (Fight, Physical, Social, Hex, Sickness, etc). That said, it's still quite fun.  I do wish there was a bit more 'personal interaction' on the god level - you're supposed to be playing as a god looking through your people's eyes, but ultimately that's not the feel you get. You could just as easily be a chieftan, and god selection would just represent what god your people held dearest. That's the feeling I get, anyway, kind of a King of Dragon Pass sort of treatment of the gods.  A bit more diversity in production options would be nice too, as far as buildings go at least. Maybe in addition to producing goods and structures, those with magic could produce 'spells' or 'blessings.' Then again, it might be too late to add in something like that, given that it's no longer in beta as of November. Perhaps a later expansion or something similar.  The events are probably the highlight, especially the more detailed ones that lead to questlines. Quite interesting and immersive. If nothing else, more and more variety of those would be awesome as well.  All that said, I've enjoyed the game immensely, and my comments above are more nitpicking than anything else.

It's a mix of 4X-ish, RPG, roguelike, card game elements and overall is a pretty original package. I've gotten 76 hours out of this game so far, more so than many other AAA games that are 3x the price.  I do have some gripes though, there seem to be some performance issues in the late game, which I presume are due to the high number of enemies on the map, villagers and items. It's not a big issue, but a bit annoying since the frames dip from time to time.  My only other gripe is that the difficulty curve is a bit off, the game starts off as being pretty difficult, you have to struggle to survive, but later on when you start crafting higher tier equipment and your villagers get a bit higher up in level, the game becomes progressively less difficult.    But those negative points are counterbalanced by the fantastic music, great art and most importantly, the very fun gameplay. I can't describe it any other way than 'you'll lose track of time' when playing this.

While very little actually changed apart from additional content dealing with giants (which, if I'm being honest, the game would feel incomplete without), my review is basically the same, and remains positive.  PROS: * Combat is fun, and better yet, you can skip it with Auto-Resolve if you're positive you're going to win... or just don't feel like facing your demise for long.  * Fully narrated by one guy. Like a true Dungeon Master, he also does the 'voice acting' for all the characters. This is a huge pro for me just because it adds even more to that campy storytelling element that's so rare these days. * Difficulty is highly customizeable each play-through. * Very deep game system overall, though it can be a bit overwhelming at first. * Comes with an event editor. * Crafting system is simply fun to play around with. * Nice ambient soundtrack.  CONS: * Can only have your starting settlement, which is kind of a drag. For larger maps it'd be nice to have two or even three villages. But this is a very different beast from the sort of base expansion type game you'd expect from other 4x titles, with more of a focus on your expeditions. * In order to start a new game, you must erase your previous one. I get that from a roguelike perspective, but I wish I could save a world. * Kind of short, but there is the iffy replay value. You're just playing mostly the same events in different ways and varying difficulties.  * The UI and input could use some cleaning up. Would some more keyboard input hurt? Most of your input is going to be with the mouse.  Overall though, this game is worth every penny. It might put you off at first but you'll find yourself drawn back.  BUG: The further you get into a late play-through after hundreds of turns, you'll notice the UI start to hitch in the inventory/production/expedition screens. Initially I thought this was a memory leak, but I never experienced a crash; I'm not sure what exactly causes this, but it's probably just from having too much stuff. Equipment and villagers both count as inventory items, so maybe that's it? If you dismantle items you know you won't use as you go along you should alleviate the bug, and there's a neat shortcut to do so when you acquire them.",

The card mini-game for fights and challenges are simple but versatile, bringing out unique customizations while maintaining overall balance. It works.

The events that happen are constantly changing and have different outcomes.  Leveling up and equiping my teams with great gear has become an addiction, and despite the world being small, there's a ton to do.  The game is tough, even when played on easy novice, but not too tough that you don't want to play. Just tough enough that you aren't bored.  Getting the hang of the game is quite easy, and is done in the first hour, but mastering this game could take ages.   CONS:  No save, other than an autosave every 5 turns, which is super annoying for someone like me, who hates every negative outcome or the death of a person. *** I have been informed there is a save feature by one of the developers. You have to change the settings before you start playing the game to turn on saves, and then, while playing, you press esc to access the menu that allows you to save. You can NOT turn on saves after you have been playing, it has to be done before you start a game (which still makes it a con in my book)**** Every time I die and reload (and sit through a two minute load screen), the tutorial popups start over at the beginning. There's no way to turn them off without starting a new game, and losing the hours and hours of building my little town.  The battle screen is done in a card battle format, which is absolutely NOT for me. I just press 'auto resolve' or I lose. AND sometimes they will give you a starting twon where the people you begin with all do literally no damage. You can't kill even the first mobs of the game.  They rate the enemies with a 1-5 skull toughness system, but it's very difficult to tell how many skulls your team can safely go up against.

These cards are modified by character types, equipment and stats all which combine to give a huge variety of customisation of your characters.  The game is also quite brutal, many of your characters will die along the way. This is the kind of game where demons sweep down at night and steal all your children and eat them, or your community is crippled by plague, disease, curse, or ... insert your favourite pestilance here...  With a randomly generated map every game is different, and resource placement on that map means wach game is a different challnge.

            "review_text": "Short review: Incredible game. The game world is laid out sorta like Civ or Endless Legend - a hex based grid with resources, events, enemies scattered about. The big difference is all you ever get is one city. You use your citizens to gather, build, explore, fight, and do quests. Sort of a mash up of a 4x and a survival / base building game. The game's mythology and atmosphere is extremely interesting and well done. Very highly recommended, one of the best games I've played recently.   Long review: There is a main story quest (several if you count the DLC lines, all of which are free) and you'll constantly be encountering various other events. Some are repetitive, some only happen once. But they all generally offer many different ways you can solve them, often based on the skills of your characters.  Combat is handled via a card system - each of your units (and enemy units) is represented by a card. They're randomly split 50/50 into attack + support. Attack guys can only jump into the field of battle, and support guys can either buff/debuff or jump into battle with a 1 turn cooldown. Each side takes turn playing 1 card (or 2+ if they have lots of units) and once all cards are played they are resolved in order, attacking randomly whatever enemy card is closest to the left or right of them. There are only 2 turns per combat round (after all the cards are out) and then you re-allocate the existing cards.  On top of that you'll often have different combat options presented to you - social, physical challenge, actual fighting, hexing, poison, etc. Each depends on a different set of stats on your characters and there's a LOT of stat types. It can be a bit overwhelming at first but I think it adds nicely to the depth of the game. In actual fighting, every time your guys get hit they take wounds, which can result in death if the wounds are too severe. The other challenges are generally a better option since you can take 'damage' without wounds - but if you fail there will be penalties which can be quite steep, and often times you'll end up having to fight after failing. So even before you jump into battle you're making decisions on how you want to approach encounters.  Your units level up universally. So your in-town crafters will still benefit from your raiding party's escapades. Oh and if you craft using better-than-basic materials you get a lot of tech and XP, so an important strategy is to farm a bunch of mats to spam junk items to level up your crew.  I'd say the most frustrating part of the game is the very beginning. It's very easy to lose units, especially when you're new and don't know what events/fights are risky. Losing 5-6 guys early on is essentially crippling. But losing 2-3 early is recoverable, and you just have to embrace the fact that you're going to lose some of your guys from time to time.  The game's atmosphere and story are excellent. I really felt like I was in a world wrapped in magic and mythology. The main story was also quite interesting and I've seen very different endings based upon what starting god I chose and the way I approached the main quest.  The starting god you choose does make some difference to how the game plays. At first you only have 2 choices and you unlock more by playing. The gods themselves level up as you play under their banner, but it takes a LONG time to unlock their bonus tiers - or even just to play a full game. Which is fine, I don't think 15+ hours for a single game is unreasonable for this type of game, but that only unlocks level 2 or 3 out of 5 for a given god. So unlocking the top tier buffs will take quite some time.  Co-op works well, I rarely had desync problems, and when they did happen I was able to exit + restore at worst losing 1 turn. The biggest issue is you can't do anything when your partner is doing their start-of-turn events, that plus the regular turn-based game imbalance (sometimes one person has a lot of stuff to do when the other person is ready for the next turn instantly) makes for a lot of down time. I got some good mileage out of my smartphone while playing co-op. But I think that's just the nature of this type of game played multiplayer, so I don't have any complaints.  There is strong replayability here, every time I play through I think of different ways I want to build up my town or different starting loadouts I want to try. On the other hand, while the world layout changes, the main quest stays generally the same, and you sort of get used to the types of enemies and side quests. So after beating the game 3 times I'm ready for a break - but I'll definitely be playing it again in the future.  Overall one of the best games I've played recently. The combat system was surprisingly enjoyable, the game combines some of my favorite elements of base building + survival + 4x games, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic world of atmosphere and lore. If you're interested in this game at all, I very highly recommend you get it.",

To enjoy this game, you should 1) enjoy some micromanagement and planning 2) find enjoyment in RNG screwing you and coming back from it. 90% of the gameplay in Thea is RNG based, from which events happen, to which characters you get, to which resources are close by. Count on high child mortality. 3) find small pleasure in taking notes for gameplay because there are A LOT of skills that affect battle and you want a cohesive group (e.g. which skills are attack for which challenges) 4) role play your group like the god you choose, selecting different choices in various events that happen in the world  I think you will know if this game is for you from this alone.   The difficulty can be customized in a fairly good way and you should not think you're good at this game until you have evidence of it, keep the difficulty down to start. But since difficulty affects your score, and score affects how soon you unlock all 8 gods' powers, you will always want to push it until you've unlocked them all, then set the difficulty that keeps you interested in the game and just enjoy it. No forced multiplayer, no gimmicks, stop playing pretty much whenever you want, it's nearly the ideal single-player game.

The obvious similarity, as pointed out by many others, is to the exploration phase of Civilization, when much of the world was still shrouded in the fog.   Here the concept: You start with a village in the aftermath of a world destroyed by darkness. Now, your aim is to survive, thrive and eventually defeat the big bad. There is a village simulator, in the sense of producing resources, crafting, and keeping the village alive and healthy. You lead expeditions or parties of characters out to explore the world, find treasures, search ruins and destroy evil. You have to balance the 2, as well as many other luxuries - but you won't have the resources or time to obtain them all in a desolate and unforgiving world.   Pros: Good world-build and narrativising. The lore really sets a sense of dread and devastation at every turn.  Solid mechanics, from combat to research to building the village. Some complexity, but aided by clear and extensive tutorials (and even video tutorials). Combat is quite different from most other games, but the tutorial clears the confusion after a battle or two.  Varied encounters, enough that it doesn't devolve into a nonsensical choice merely between 'search for goodies' and 'leave'. Has any gamer ever picked the 'leave' option??  Cons: This has been likened to a rogue-like, in that you will lose often. However, what is good for me is the meta-ability to power up your villagers after every game, based on how well you have done. I am sure there's a mode/mod for the full rogue-like experience of having no advantages if you prefer that too.   For me, the innovative gameplay and emphasis on narrative makes this interesting and fun enough from other games out there.",

The one thing that I'm only slightly worried about is the tangential learning about slavic mythology, and more of a question to the developer than anything else. Is this game only based in slavic mythology with taking enough creative license to deviate from the myth, or does it actually present the mythos in a manner that could be used in discussion without a theologist punching me out?",

The tutorial is good, the game isn't hard to pick up, and it has a quasi Heroes of Might and Magic/DnD feel to it; yet you will get wrecked the first time you come into contact with a 4 skull group of enemies.  You don't 'win' Thea, you just do a little bit better each time.   Eventually you will finish the Cosmic Tree quest and you unlock more attributes of each god you play as. Then you turn up the difficulty and try a more stealth approach with a different god.   For $10 Thea is a good game to buy. The card 'battle' system is unique and uses the skills of your group in different challenges, the game can be very hard at times, and you feel good when you can successfully charm a group of bandits out of their loot because one of your group has +5 attractiveness.   Nothing like medieval pimping to fully round out a DnD game.",

They care, and that means a lot with all the unsupported schlock out there.  Anyway, the game itself is sort a 4x... Except there's no eXpand. You only have one village and getting another villager is a pretty big deal. The research tree is large but well considered. The two major mechanics are a skill influenced choose-your-own-adventure (fully voice acted), and what I think is an extremely well done card based conflict resolution system. I say conflict resolution because it's used for sneaking, parley, outwitting, etc and continues to work great, although there is a small learning curve.  There is a lot of game here for $20, my only.... Negative, if you can call it that, is that I cannot even guess how many hours of voice acting have been put into this game. How much money and time and effort, and it's well done. But... It's a rogue-like, permadeath with progression, so you will end up seeing some of the same quests over playthroughs (a la FTL). Many times, if you know the quest, you're just going to click through it. So I've shut off the voice and I wonder how many others have as well after hearing it so many times.

This game's main issue is that it has a stupidly large learning curve. It is that simple. There IS a tutorial available for the game, but the game is extremely poor at guiding you through the nuances of the mechanics and giving tips along the way on how to improve your play and keep villagers alive. It really doesn't help that the game is on permament Iron Man mode so you cannot take back moves and experiment with different approaches to the same problem.  Once you get over this learning curve however, the game suddenly becomes easy. Some folks say trivially easy. Since I'm over that stupidly large learning curve, I'm now playing the game and I'm enjoying navigating my way through all the challenges and experimenting with different strategies. So yes, in spite of the negative tone of this review, I actually recommend this game. It is a good game once you can get past the learning curve.  Recommendation: Before you start a battle or any type of challenge, learn how the card battle system works exactly. Do not try to learn it on the fly. The game does a very poor job of explaining, yet the card battle is a core gameplay activity that is used to resolve all encounters.",

I've won the game twice, but... I dont even know how/why I won it!...... I keep playing it because I'm tryng to understand it o.O - Replayability is not that good. After a couple of games you start thinking 'If I start a new game, everything will be like last game, so why would I?' - There's no summary of village bonuses from buildings. - When you send your expedition\\units somewhere that takes several turns to go, you have to move them manually every turn. And there's no reminding you that they haven't moved. Why? - It's a bit hard and time-consuming to keep track of what equipment is excessive and what to keep. A lock-function or something would be nice. - The longer into the game I get, the more I keep ending turn because I'm waiting for rare resources to be gathered. Not the most exciting end game. - The quest log feels like a mess, it's tiresome to figure out what exactly is left to do. - I have close to 200 kids, and I still have to wait several turns before 1 of them grows up...

Lots of crafting with different ingredients and recipes. Relatively short games, but with high replay value. Most negative point is the way battles/challenges are resolved, a bit repetitive after a while.  ----  The world has fallen into darkness, and you're a god, trying to lead a last enclave of your followers through the dark times and towards morning. Your task is to figure out what happened in the world, and how to go forwards in it.   You start out with a village (and will never have more than the one) with a small population. Each of your people is unique, with its own combination of skills that make them suited to different tasks. In the village, you gather, craft and build. You can send out scouting parties across the hex-field-filled world to explore, fulfill quests, fight enemies and fetch rare resources. Dangers are posed by roaming bands of monsters and random events; and a dangerous world it is indeed. Death of a beloved villager is always a possibility, and each and every one will be missed.  There's two things here that I really like about the game that I should stress: The crafting system and the events/quests. The latter are well written, especially for a primary strategy game, with different creatures than you'd see in your standard fantasy genre. The former consists of recipes unlocked by research (research points are generated through practially any event and through crafting). The wonderful thing is that you get a recipe that allows many, many different combinations of resources that not only impact the stats, but also the name and appearance of the result. Experimenting is fun! Without good equipment, the most experienced warrior is but a bloodstain in a giant's path.  Then there's one thing I've grown to dislike about Thea: The card-based challenge system and the multitude of challenges. I won't go into detail about the card system, but it does get tiresome after the umpeenth time you play the same basic idea. Fortunately, there's an auto-resolve. Unfortunately, it occasionally screws up badly and you're in danger of losing people you really can't lose. Me, I use the configurable difficulty scale to allow manual saves and reload if necessary. Cheating? Maybe. But I'm playing to have fun. There are also many kinds of challenges; not everything is combat. That is good. It is, however, quite difficult to keep all the stats and the way they interlink in mind. A little less may have been more. That's a minor squabble, though.  The good absolutely trumps the bad in Thea. I very much recommend that you check it out for yourselves!  ",

At first, the game may raise your eyebrow and leave you perplexed, since it's quite unique, or rather, it's a unique mixture of things, but don't let that discourage you! It only took me about 2 hours to learn the game and once you do, man it's cool! It's like mixing a Civ game with Minecraft, some Heroes of Might and Magic and a card game that is very different from most.   This interesting and unqiue blend of gameplay elements make it a very enjoyable game, with a TON of content, lot's of strategies, awesome tavern music and much more.  5/5, definitely worth the asking price!",
