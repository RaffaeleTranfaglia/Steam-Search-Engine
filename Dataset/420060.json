Breathtaking watercolor graphics. Excellent intuitive (but not too easy) puzzles. Runs so well you won't believe it's made in Unity. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.",

            "review_text": "I like that the key to solve most puzzles is to observe, and this game is a pure bliss to look at.  Some puzzles took me a long time to figure them out (like in the old graphic adventures), but when the solution is seen it's so much rewarding. The cave painting one, it had me looking at the drawings for a good half an hour and then in one second it all made sense and it blew my mind, so simple and so difficult :-D  I recommend this game. Specially if you enjoyed Sierra and LucasArts games.",
