    "description": "A Visual Novel set in the Deadlands Noir RPG Setting from Savage Worlds. * Now updated to include Episode 1 and 2 * New Orleans, 1935. Whoever called this &quot;The Big Easy&quot; sure got that one wrong. Things are tough all over. Honest work is hard to find, and even dishonest jobs are getting scarce.",

Seems I've been getting away from my normal otome games that i love so much, To see what other genres have to offer. This came at a cheap price with a free 2nd episode/chapter with unlockable achievements. Its good all around.",

            "review_text": "I have no idea why this game is getting such negative reviews. I've attempted to play quite a few visual novels over the past couple years that came in bundles and not many were worth playing more than 5 minutes. This one was worth sticking it out for though its only about a 1/2 hour. There's only really 3 times in the game were your choices lead to different outcomes but overall don't impact the story to much. The music is not bad and sometimes is quite good. I found the writing enganging if you like the whole 1930's noir PI trope. The occult bits in the game too were mostly good and that made this short PG-13 choose your own adventure experience worth finishing. Easy to reload those 3 turning points to get all the achievements as well if that's your thing. 6/10 - If you don't like the trope probably not for you. If you do I think it's well worth at least $2.",

If you are strongly opposed to any mention of religious themes, or on the contrary have peculiarly bizarre beliefs and are offended by anything contrary to them, this might not be for you.",
