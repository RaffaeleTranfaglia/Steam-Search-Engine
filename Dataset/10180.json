God, I wish I could bring those days back.   Now, about the game. The graphics are crisp to this day and the multiplayer still gives me a reason to hit it up every now and then. The Campaign is pretty intense and challenging, just like its predecessor. Sometimes it gets so intense, it tends to challenge your emotional stability. Especially the part where... Okay, no spoilers.   People still play this, so yeah, to those of you think this game is dead, it isn't, not yet. I have played all the 3 games in the series and this was the best, for me. Just a wee bit ahead of MW1, and light years ahead of MW3.    Edit : The only concerns are that of hackers plus these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unlock-everything servers that you get connected to without your notice that instantly promote you to level 70. Happened thrice till now and resetting the stats is pretty complicated. ",

            "review_text": "The very last great Call of Duty game.   Hello, I originally began playing the original WW-2 set CoD on PC back when I was a boy on my Uncle's computer. I was fascinated with how fun and 'realistic' it was. I was immediately hooked on the games. I played Cod 2 and 3 religiously, and I will never ever forget the day I heard about Modern Warfare. Finally. FINALLY a game of 21st century setting. I was ecstatic. I played through the campaign and had endless hours of multiplayer logged on my Xbox 360. After doing everything I thought possible in that game, my dream came true, and another was released. To some, there's almost no difference between CoD4MW, and MW2. To others, like myself, there's an indescribable gap between the two games, where MW2 is on a whole new and higher level. To me, no other shooter game has had the balance MW2 had. It has set a standard for me that I look to in other FPS games, often times I find no equal, save the original Black Ops game. This balance is what made the game for me. I've never been a person to be 'naturally' good at video games. MW2 was one where I excelled. Because I had a fighting chance. I found my niche and I stuck with it. I maxed the game on my Xbox 360, and eventually grew into PC gaming, leaving consoles behind. I only have a few minutes played on this game so far, but I had to actually back out and type this up even after the first few matches. It has been such a trip for me going through the menus and the lobby system. If you're considering buying this game for nostalgia, do it. Do it and don't take any flak that comes to you. Do it, and relive your early teens of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ girlfriends, mountain dew, and yelling at your parents. If you've never played MW2 and are looking to see the hype, I'm afraid it's gone forever. There's a few people around on the servers, but the HYPE, the actual maxed pace heartbeat of a game that took the world by storm is gone forever and ever. Then again, maybe that's the beautiful thing. Maybe that's what has this game frozen in time as one of the all time greatest.   Forever and ever, Modern Warfare 2.   NuovaVita",

And unlike what you might expect, all my skyhigh expectations was suddenly very real. The gameplay was smooth (for a freshly launched game, mind you), the levels were well made, and the action was fast paced.  Now, even after several hundred hours spent in the multiplayer, and many new titles being released since, I still find myself returning to this game from time to time. the amount of players still playing, is ever dwindling, as can be expected with an aging game.  but the feeling this game gives you, of nostalgia, of pure fun and carnage, is unlike any other game out there (save for DOOM 3, and UT 2004). It really is, an all time classic.   If you have yet to play this game, but like fast paced shoot-em-in-the-face-and-laugh type of FPS games, then this is for you. If you on the other hand like FPS games that require more though than duck, run, and shoot, this game (hell, this whole series of games) might not fall to your liking.  However, given that its drop in price of the years, althought still not cheap by any means, it's defo worth a try. If nothing else, to take on your mates, and have a blast that you will all be able to remember.  I hope this provided you with some usefull insight into this game.  All The best  Pvt. Mini",

You can also play the second game mode which you can play in co-op and get three stars in all missions and stuff, I did it on the Xbox and it's really fun to play with a friend.  Multiplayer is pretty good. It's not as dedication-rewarding as the newer games, prestiging resets everything litteraly so it's not very fun to prestige. The guns are really fun though. Lots of traditional weapons such as UZI and M4A1, good off-hands (shotguns are secondaries, overpowered but fun). All the guns are fun in their own way if you know how to use them. Attachments are as usual. Red dot sights, silencers, noobtubes (which are horribly overpowered in this game and has never been fixed, probably because IW doens't care about gaming experience), nothing new. You can unlock different versions of attachments by using that attachment which is pretty cool. Using the Red Dot Sight unlocks Holographic Sight, using underbarrel grenade launcher unlocks underbarrel shotgun, stuff like that. Emblems and titles are really cool and well-made imo. Killstreaks is nothing new. Care package, chopper support, airstrikes, controlling AC130s weapons and being a chopper gunner, stuff like that. They're cool and fun to get but not original. Maps are really cool. A russian snow map, a woodland map with a really cool cabin on a hill, tight urban combat in an afghanistan-like map, love the maps in this game. They're the best maps in any CoD game imho. You can also buy a map pack that gives you the maps from CoD 4 (not sure if all of them) which is really cool  If you're a CoD fan then this game is nice to play sometimes when you want a good CoD game to not dedicate yourself to or take seriously. Of course, there will be hackers, as in all IW CoD games.",

The storyline follows 2 different characters (and a few more but for the most part, just 2) It's a great storyline with betrayal and plot twist, and will end fittingly in Modern Warfare 3. Modern Warfare 2 is arguably my favorite game in the Call of Duty series (I lost interest after MW3) and I recommend it. The Online is in fact alive but you have to navigate through a few modded/hacked lobbies (and I believe some may bring a VAC ban). I played MW2 and MW3 quite a bit on my PS3 but as I revisit it, it's just not as fun as it used to be for me. (It's worth a buy while on sale though!)  Pros: Great storyline Nostalgia for some people :) Fun spec ops missions with quite a bit of replayability (though MW3's survival mode is much better) Many environments to explore Cons: Not many 'legit' lobbies left Without a friend, spec op missions aren't nearly as enjoyable",

Good sound design. Soap on a Rope. Outstanding soundtrack. Great killstreak variety. Best story of any Call of Duty game. Cpl. Dunn.  -Cons: Player base is annoying. 'Ramirez! Aim down 'ya sights!' 'Aim down 'ya sights!' Sergeant Foley alltogether. Campaign is WAY too short, but is continued in Modern Warfare 3. NAT Type STRICT... 24/7 Disconnected from host alot.  TL;DR, f*cking buy it.",

Overall Campaign is a great rollercoaster of setpieces and missions that drive the story and the characters around the world. It was great but its short length and lack of a complete conclusion keeps it from being perfect. If it was the last Modern Warfare game without the cliffhanger ending it would be almost perfect. the Spec Ops mode is a Co-Op oriented multiplayer mode that puts you and a friend together to take on a few mini missions. These are extemely fun and can be played solo, but I HIGHLY recommend you get a friend. Overall Spec-Ops is a great addition to the game and I enjoy it more than zombies.

Weapons in the game are fun to use and each one has their own little niche for different players, whether you're a rush-in-and-hit-'em-hard type, or a-sit-back-and-let-them-come-to-me kind of player.   Biggest gripes I could come up with for this game are the scant amount of perks available at the start and how much of a grind it feels like to level up. The most redeeming feature are the maps - most of them are fantastic and well-designed with different overwatch spots, cross-ways, multiple routes to take for flanking or getting to the objective, and a lot of maps force you to play differently than you would on other maps. Also, if you're at all familiar with the map Favela, for some reason it never comes up in map circulation anymore; it's weird.  If you're a fan of Call of Duty and you won't mind the chance to happen upon a modded lobby in multiplayer, dealing with players liberally using grenade launchers, or those players using the cheapest tactics they can so as to get that Chopper Gunner/AC-130/Nuke, then by all means get this game and have fun with it.",

I'm sure this will be on sale again soon with MW3 on the way. If you haven't experienced this game yet, I highly recomend it. It was worth the wait.",

This was the first Call of Duty game that truly started to feel like a string of set-pieces. However, at this point, the series had not yet fully developed into the farce it would become.  Modern Warfare was known for its big twist, which made its story great. Modern Warfare 2 tried to capitalize on that infamy by doing the exact same thing, multiple times. It did not have the same effect.  There are some filler missions in the campaign that you will not ever go back to after the first time, but some campaign missions are genuinely fun to play over and over again (Wolverines!, for example). There is replay value here. Also, they finally removed the infinitely respawning enemies that previous installments were known for, which is a big plus.  The Spec Ops missions were actually a highlight of the game, if you could find a friend to play with. Playing as a sniper team together, or having one person provide fire support from an AC-130 was truly enjoyable.  Modern Warfare 2 is silly, but it’s probably the last still-enjoyable Call of Duty installment.",

But this game, Modern Warfare 2, was and still is THE LAST GOOD CALL OF DUTY GAME! Every game after MW2 was not bad but not good either, except for Black Ops, maybe.   CAMPAIGN: 7,5/10 The campaign is set 5 years after the events of Modern Warfare. USA is under attack by a new terrorist, Vladmimir Makarov, and of course are YOU the only one who can save USA and the world from World War III.  You play as 4 soldiers: PFC Allen, SGT Gary 'Roach' Sanderson, PVT James Ramirez and CPT John 'Soap' MacTavish. 'Roach' and 'Soap' are from Task Force 141 and Allen and Ramirez are from the Army Rangers. The missions are different from the TF141 and Ranger missions, which isn't very surprising. The TF141 missions are more stealth missions rather then a full scale war, like the Rangers mission. If I had to choose my favorite Ranger and TF141 missions it has to be 'Cliffhanger', (TF141) and 'Wolverines!'. (Rangers)   The story took me about 4 hours to complete on PS3, and I haven't completed it on PC. It consists of three acts, each with about 5-10 missions, in total 15-30 missions. It's a decent number of missions, but it could've been more.   The set pieces are sometimes great, sometimes not so great, but overall it's good. It's ranging from large cities to oilrigs and prisons. Overall, pretty good.  MULTIPLAYER: 9.5/10 In every COD game, is there a multiplayer feature? YES! This is definitely the best part in the entire game! With loads of unlockable perks, weapons, camos, titles and emblems, THIS IS AWESOME!   + - Great quantity of unlockables - Decent graphics - Good music  _ - Only 12 players in a private game - Small maps - Hillarious but gamebreaking GLITCHES  Overall rating: 8/10 This is still my favorite COD game and will continue to be so. With loads of errors and loads of sucesses, Modern Warfare 2 is the last good Call Of Duty game.",

Sure there were issues with kniving, bullet sponging, and balance but they never spoiled the fun for me. However when the next cod came out i left MW2 in the dark, but i always regarded it as one of my favourites.   I have contemplated buying this game for the PC and so when i saw it on sale i decided to buy it, it was a good choice.   The singleplayer mode is still great fun as are the spec ops missions. The only let down is the multiplayer but that only down to the lack of players. 8/10 times i can get in a full game but its usually TDM and nothing else which is a shame but not the end of the road. Its still great fun but now we get to the crux of the issue; do i recommend it? For a sale price, definitely. For full price, nope. Its a shame that Activision refuse to change the pricing with the times, heck COD4 still goes for £20 when not on sale which is ludicrous when you consider its age and lack of active community.   TL;DR On sale? Buy buy buy! Not on sale? Dont bother.",

The Special Ops mode adds replay value to the game if I wanted to get better at the game.  Mind you, multiplayer mode is totally broken and without a doubt unsupported, but I've never been interested in FPS multiplayer games anyways. Besides, if I felt like playing that mode, I could always mod the game so I could play with offline bots where I'd never experience lag, complaints, or waiting.  Also! This means that my playtime hours are misrepresentative because unfortunately, the mod I use makes the game independent from Steam so the rest of the hours I spend playing the game don't get recorded anymore.

            "review_text": "Five years ago I bought this game in the blink of an eye, and the world (people at Gamestop) just f****g watched.  CAMPAIGN - The campaign is a very good, action packed, fast paced, cliche thrill ride, like a Michael Bay flick, except instead of spectating, you get to participate in. It continues indirectly about 5 years (see a theme going on here?) after the events of Call Of Duty 4, and you play as a variety of characters and take part in a variety of over the top events in massive setpieces. One even is allowed to partake in the massacre of civilians, which might be in bad taste for sensitive individuals, but I honestly felt the whole sequence was an arbitrary catalyst for you to shoot stuff, and seems like IW just squeezed it in there for the shock value than actually advancing the plot. Not much else is to be said, but if you want a thrill ride, play it, it's a fairly short campaign, with a run on Regular lasting only about 5-6 hours depending on how fast you play.   There is also replay value in Veteran Mode, if you are an achievement hunter like I am, but be prepared to die, see lots of red jelly on your screen, and a lot of 'eh eh eh eh eh ahhhh' when you get shot every 15 seconds. I find it odd and stupid you grunt and groan the same way no matter who you play as, but the real question is, who the hell does that? It sounds more like something else was going on when they recorded that clip, and that's been in every COD since 4. Get some new sounds going on IW. Other than that nothing else to be said about the campaign.  SPEC OPS - More replay value action here, run through a bunch of recycled maps and assets from the campaign, alone or with a friend. Get completely torn up by Juggernauts in the Delta and Echo ops on Veteran. Rage quit and try again for insignificant gratification of virtual stars. Great fun.  MULTIPLAYER - 2009, absolute fun, with almost 200-300 hours clocked on my console version, its a blast just jumping into a game and blasting people away with M1887'S or Glockin' someone's grill up by drop shotting them. Lot of unlock, lots of weapons and killstreaks to play with, and the gimmicky prestiging, if you're into that sort of stuff. The maps are similar, but not wholeheartedly recycled from the campaign, and 90% of the maps I enjoyed, and varied from long sightlines to close quarters height based combat. I dare say it was probably the best MP experience of the time. 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 - The multiplayer is absolute fecal matter exhumed from buffalos, its absolutely abysmal, plagued with hackers, boosters, cheaters, noob-tubers, the list goes on. 95% use OMA Pro, Danger Close with a TAR-21 GL and noob-tubes across the maps infinitely, and you'd be lucky if anyone is using a assault rilfe, or even playing this game now. Since COD has now become a epitome of FPS and dished out annually, it is expected that support will be relinquished for this game, but that just shows how much Activision and IW care about their products after less than 11 months on the shelves.  CONCLUSION - Good SP experience, OK MP experience, if you play spec ops or have private matches, but don't buy it for MP, even for 10 bucks save your money, and don't be a fool to also buy all the map packs that you'll never get to because the game is pretty much dead, only populated with sad lonely hackers that feel some gratification cheating on a 5 year old video game. 2009 RATING - 9.5/10  2014 RATING - 7.5/10",

It is a throwback to a time where I scrapped up $60 to grab it from the local video game retailer where I lived. To be honest, I didn't understand how to play the game when I was that young. I just shot wildly and would have tantrums playing it if I lost. I didn't end up having fun, and I'm sure I ruined the game for everyone in the matches I played. What I can say, is that I have grown to respect the game now, and that comes with age. It's not about the best kills or the best quickscope, its about playing the game to have fun, not pull a 'Ohh, 1v1 me you ♥♥♥, I'll no-scope you!'. Games are meant for fun, not to be the biggest A-hole on the interenet. And it's no place for 13 year olds, the maturity to play the game may not be 18 for the content, but you need that maturity that comes with age to play these games.   I do highly recommend this game for the reasons as it is a highly fun and addictive shooter, That is meant for Fun.  Graphics: 7/10 Story: 8/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Multiplayer 9/10  Overall: 32/40  Tl;Dr Great game, buy it for a throwback if you haven't already.",

The campaign is brilliant and much fun. The 'No Russian' mission is still a great one in my opinion. Not many games dare to go where Infinity Ward did with that mission. And they managed to pass it off successfully. Showing off the sheer brutality of Makarov and his crew. Now it isn't as graphically appealing as such games like Battlefield 3, but it is great for a CoD game. This is when the graphics of CoD was at it's finest. And nowadays, not to beat around the bush, but... CoD is now the most ♥♥♥♥ franchise in existence. I hate it. The only reason I bought MW2 was for how much fun it was and how much it brought to the table for FPS games. It still manages to be enjoyable and so much fun. Spec-Ops is brillaint with a friend. Hours on end went into Spec-Ops splitscreen on my Xbox 360.  Overall, I would only recommend this game now to people that still enjoy this game and are willing to pay this amount of money for a few hundred online players, the campaign (which nearly everyone has played before) and the Spec-Ops.   8/10",

Ive played 360+ Hrs. on my 360 and 11+ (as of now) on the pc version. The multiplayer was the last to have Stopping Power a perk that really made the game a level playing field it was the only home to my favorite gun: The Intervention, the QS is unbelieveably fun and never gets old. As far as the PC version goes there are some hackers and if that bothers you either learn to live with it( i had to) or dont buy this game( JUST DO IT). The campaign may not have been the most realistic but its still my favorite( the favela mission is a B****). The spec ops is IW way of giving mission based co-op and its the smoothest of any of the titles(Note it doesnt have the seriousness of the campaign its more of an arcade expierience if your not into that avoid this mode). It has the best map structure of ANY of the call of duty games and that is the feature i praise it for most. If you have $20 and you feel this may be your style of game(or maybe your a battlefield fan and thought about getting into COD this is a great game to start with) go ahead and give it a try and if you need someone else to play it with just drop me a friend request and ill be happy to play it whenever im not dealing with anything else ill be on. I hope this review helped and if it did give it a thumbs up so other can see too, and thanks for reading through this rambling of the game that was COD's glory days.",

So when I transitioned for Xbox to PC, My friends and I grabbed MW2 to relive some memories. And while we did relive our addiction for the game, we noticed a few flaws for the PC port. Now make no mistake. It's still MW2, but note that the PC port feels a bit downgraded than the console versions.  PROS: -Great story, many twists and well written for what it's worth -Great gameplay -Special ops is a great feature, especially co-op -Great voice acting -Many weapons -Many perks and equipment to choose from  CONS: -Multiplayer is flooded with hackers. I won't hold it against the game's score, but be careful when looking for a match -Death streaks, many are completely unbalanced -No controller support. Really Infinity Ward? -Shotguns are completely overpowered -Multiplayer is easily exploitable, which can lead to an unbalanced match  Despite minor complaints, this game is truly the last of Old School Call of Duty. Every time my friends and I decide to play a match of SND or TDM, it becomes and competitively tense match with lots of fun every minute. Such a shame how the current games are so focused on catering to the younger audiences with the futuristic garbage instead of taking risks and going back to the modern era or World War 2. However, Call of Duty won't change. Because the money talks. And the series is still successful with millions of dollars rolling in each year. But during each release, I feel more and more bored with the games. Literally feeling like they're trying to make it more complicated than it should be. Hopefully one of the developers will try to make something different in the historical or modern timeline and make something fun, intruiging, and simple like MW2. And then stopping for a few years so the game can have the lifespan it deserves.   Verdict: 8/10",

I originally started playing this game on the Playstation 3, but while that community died out and almost being unable to find a game to join, I decided to get this game dirt cheap on sale.  You might not find a lot of games in the rather obscure gamemodes, but if that's what you are looking for I wouldnt reccommend this game anyway. The fast phase of the game, the mechanics and basically maps do not give you the right feel when playing for example CTF or Demolition. There are other games out there that excel at this type of gameplay. But back to why i originally started playing it. Team-Deathmatch still is very playable, even to this date there arent many cheaters if at all in the lobbies I join. The fast phase of this game just makes me come back every time, Its that shooting someone feels so rewarding, even if you die 20 times after that, It doesnt matter, you'll respawn anyway.  While i dislike certain changes that there are, for example no (voice-)chat in lobbies, it doesn't influence gameplay.  This game is old and still there are people playing this, this and all of the above is the reason that I do recommend getting it if you do not have it already. Dont have the 20 euro for it? Wait for it to go on sale, I promise you its not a waste of money. You'll enjoy hopping on, playing a match or 2 and quitting again, But that like every 2 week for the rest of the time that this game is in your library.  Don't like multiplayer? Thats cool too! this game offers a great singleplayer gameplay with a continuation of the Call of Duty 4 storyline which also goes on till Call of Duty Modernwarfare 3. While the game doesnt offer much free exploration and such, I do like them because they give me the 'you are the star of the movie' kind of feel. That might not float your boat, but hey, I am reviewing this from my point of view.  The special ops is also a great addition to the game, while you can try to complete them by yourself, It makes it a lot easier when you try it together with someone else. There are a few acchievements to get here too, so when or if you have the time I'd highly suggest doing these too.  Overall is this game great, Especially now that it has aged so much, still playable in pretty much all aspects.",

I PAID THAT UPON RELEASE!  there is zero justification to pay this much, especially considering the community has dwindled exponentially, and moved on to MW3, BOPS, Ghosts etc.  even on special at the moment for $49.99 there is still zero justification to pay so much for a game that is so old. honestly? you would be better off buying CoD4 and have the joy of private servers.  it makes me sad to not recommend this game, but with the blatant price gouging by both Steam and Activision, there really isnt a choice. i just hope this review will stop alot of people wasting their hard earned money that will offer a sub-par experience at best.  off the top of my head, i can think of a dozen games that are more worthy of your hard earned $$",

If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead.

That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.",

First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did.",

Ontop of that this game issued a VAC ban on my profile for 'cheating'. The reason being is that I installed a custom weapon camo. Nobody else could see it so it was only changing my expirience, not theirs. Its funny how all the millions of hackers on this game get off the hook for hosting lobbies and using aimbot and the minute I use a simple weapon camo I am banned. From a game that came out in 2009 VAC bans should really be a thing of the past. If you want the game for the campaign go ahead but forget about the multiplayer.

Oh, and no dedicated servers, just to screw you over that little bit more. Single player campaign is way too short, multiplayer takes years to get going (and is bad, anyway). Should be in the bargain bin, but they're still charging something ridiculous.",
