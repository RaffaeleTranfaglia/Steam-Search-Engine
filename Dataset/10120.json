The difficulty levels feel pretty appropriate, however there is even a challenge on Easy mode.   The biggest complaint I have, whether by design or not, is that there is no save state for progression. Every time you exit the game, you and return, you'll start right over. Now this could be an homage to the classic arcade style that this game represents, but for most modern arcade games, a save system is really a requirement I feel. Not having the ability to continue is why I would not recommend this game.",
