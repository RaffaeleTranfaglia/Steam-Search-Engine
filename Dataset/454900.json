The game has great pixel art. But there are some problems like how the ships has content speed or it's really fast. If you like pick up and play games this is the one for you.",

I enjoyed the rougue-like element to improving your ship and the grinding was quite fun. Time will tell if I come back to this one or not, but it's going in my 'keeper' folder... If you like this style game, I think you'd like this game.",
