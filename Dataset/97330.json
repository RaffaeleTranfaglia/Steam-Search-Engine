While I appreciate all the new cards that were added, the experience as a whole felt less interesting than Magic 2012  Fortunately I was able to unlock cards this time around. Given the sheer number of decks, they really should have awarded at least two cards per battle. 30 battles per deck is just a horrible time sink, especially when it's not as fun as it used to be. I'm also starting to wish they had an option to turn off ALL animations. If I'm going to be grinding a long-♥♥♥ game, I don't want to see every card taking 5-10 seconds to play.  Sadly Archenemy mode is gone, and 2-headed giant only exists in custom games. I actually found both of those fun. In its place is Planechase mode which... *shudder*. Every round you wait for 3 CPUs to take their turns and they spin that atrocious dice over and over again. It's just... kill me now. Every time.  To the game's credit, decks felt more balanced overall. There's some strategy involved where some decks fare much better versus others, instead of a one-size-fits-all deck, but I kind of miss the feeling of overpoweredness from the previous game. The puzzles are still fun too.  Overall it's a distinctly inferior game compared to 2012. On its own, only average. I'll rate it 6/10. It makes me wish I was playing the last one.",
