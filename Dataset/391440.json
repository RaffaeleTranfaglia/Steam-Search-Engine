            "review_text": "Someways an interactive screensaver, for mathematically minded folks it may provide more. Not the most spectacular pixel art but works well for what it is. Worth nothing is the focus on plant-growth, not lifeforms. Fullscreen doesn't appear to be supported either which does reduce immersion. Only a few hints are given and gameplay is left up to experimentation. Draw in cells, fastforward time and watch the dancing pixels on-screen. DNA collected reveals new plants and mutations while power harvested gives the ability to change growth conditions.         YouTube™ Video:  XenoBloom Gameplay [PC HD] [60FPS]&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "An easy to learn but hard to master puzzle game about growing plants in a confined space where each plant has it's own little preference on space, type of soil, environment and even how close to other plants they are. The game allows you to place and remove dirt and alter the plants traits to try to get as much bio mass as possible. For only 5 bucks it's a pretty fun way to pass the time until some of the bigger games hit the digital store.",
