            "review_text": "The DROD (Deadly Rooms of Death) series, a hidden gem long revered by discerning puzzle connoisseurs, finally makes its Steam debut with DROD RPG: Tendry's Tale, complete with Steam Cloud, Achievements and Leaderboards!  DROD RPG is quite different from the main DROD series, which will also appear on Steam (hopefully) very soon. DROD first appeared in 1996 and has been kept up, reworked, and extended by just a few talented, dedicated developers and an active player/modder community.  (NOTE: when I refer to DROD RPG as opposed to Tendry's Tale, I refer to the engine and imply the possibility of there being further official DROD RPG titles)   Gameplay",

            "review_text": "Don't be fooled by the name: this game is not an RPG. It is first and foremost a puzzle game. The title isn't misleading though: DROD has become synonymous with excellency in puzzle games, and RPG means it will appeal to every fan of min-maxing or theorycrafting one can usually find in RPGs. This is a numbers game wrapped in a pleasant interface, an original soundtrack and a deep backstory sprinkled over all the DROD games. This game is story heavy for a puzzle game, but story light for an RPG: there is no complex story to read or numerous anecdotes and side-quests. The story elements are delivered through voice acting and will make you love Tendry for is panache ! The game is best enjoyed with at least two playthroughs. Saving often and backtracking is an inherent part of the gameplay. You have to strike a balance between going forth to gain knowledge of level layout and going back to better optimize your road. The DROD series is user content friendly and DROD RPG is no exception: if you liked the game, you can get more !  I highly suggests you visit the official website caravelgames for additional content... including FREE games !",
