            "review_text": "I really want to like this game, but I put it down for very long lengths of time and when I pick it back up to try and play again I'm reminded of why I don't like the game. Would I reccomend this game? I wouldn't. Not for full price, anyway.   First I think I should delve into things I do like about the game. The music, the visuals and the overall aesthetic are really nice-- it's what attracted me to the game in the first place. The music is brilliant with memorable tracks. That being said, I haven't gotten past the first stage so I've potentially only heard three or four of the total number of tracks.   The thing I don't like is the actual gameplay itself. I don't mind the fact that it's a brawler with enemies swarming near constantly. I'm used to it as I've played games like Castlevania where enemies continue to respawn. But What I don't like is the movement lock when your player character attacks an enemy with a lot of health. It's fine if you only have to press the attack button once, but on enemies that take two or three punches it's irritatingly unfair to be locked in place without the ability to push them back with your attacks. Either the attacks should be better weighted, or you should be granted the ability to move while attacking.  The largest problem for the mechanics of this game is that punching and kicking is essentially all you do which make the mechanics more glaringly frustrating and grueling. EDIT: It's also worth mentioning that the item pick ups add another layer of frustration. You must choose between attacking with your body, attacking with a very perishible item that may only eliminate one enemy from the screen, or healing if multiple items and enemies pop on you.   It does have multiplayer but I prefer playing alone and since this game does have a singleplayer option, I don't feel as though buying a miserable, unplayable time by myself makes any sense.  Try it if the premise interests you, but I wouldn't be surprised if you returned it.",

Stuck on Lvl 2 Stage 7 cause of the witches, i wish they introduced that enemy like they did with the others, a tad slower, I can't seem to kill them or jump high enough or have any way to practice against them for that matter but damn it is a fun game no matter the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off I am. Should pick it up, youll get way more then 10 hours out of it if you wanna beat it.",

            "review_text": " A really enjoyable arcade game with very good super low-res pixel art.  The artistic part of the game is absolutely inspiring. The difficulty is high but —as in any good arcade game— it allows you to go further every time you play. Learning and getting better at the game's nature and parameters is part of the experience. BUT sometimes the gameplay is more punishing than I expected. I can't say it's due to a bad design, but a matter of getting used to the game's tempo:     It seems the game needs to be more responsive sometimes. There's a certain delay between your actions and the character.    If you are facing a direction while punching enemies you can't change to the opposite one with ease. You need to stop, face the other direction and start punching again. Once again, it's a matter of tempo. But a bit frustrating on occasions.    The main character's death or impact animations are exaggerated IMO and the recovery is slow. The added displacement often gets you into an even more complicated situation.   But the most important thing:  it crashes all the time on Mac.  Constantly. For no specific reason. I haven't been able to finish a single play without crashing, which is really, really annoying, considering it's an arcade game with no continues. Super unstable. I'd like to read more reviews by Mac users an see if this is usual. I think the game would improve with some little twists and —above all— avoiding the crashes on Mac. Otherwise, it's unplayable.  Despite all these things, still a great, beautiful and addictive old-school arcade game.",
