            "review_text": "Belladonna is a point &amp; click adventure game, featuring subtle horror/ Frankenstein-esque atmosphere, beautifully painted backdrops and a sweet, likable protagonist. She wakes up in a laboratory, not knowing who she is or what she is, but exhibits joy of discovery &amp; curiosity rather than fear. Her character traits quickly emerge, like the urge to name things (suit of armor? must be Roland the Poet:) making her the more fleshed out.  The story is quite simple, but still graceful &amp; interesting. We learn most of it by reading torn out journal pages, which are well written &amp; well paced out. Some additional information comes from interacting with objects or looking at things. Her commentaries about the surroundings are quite enjoyable, even if they have nothing to do with the plot itself.  I liked it myself, hence the thumbs up, but it has one major flaw - length. This is very short game. If you read everything carefully and listen to the protagonist's every comment on every subject, you still will finish it under an hour. It's is also quite easy, especially if you pay attention to what is said (the main character will often hint herself as what to do next), so you basically breeze through it, which just intensifies the length problem.  Also personal &amp; really minor gripe - card settings. I basically finished game 3 times when I hit 2 hour mark and first card dropped, and then I left it idle, but cards seem to be set do drop every half an hour or more, so I had to idle over 5 hour mark to obtain them all, in a game that takes under 1 hour to complete (and that's only if you try hard to prolong the experience).  Overall I liked the atmosphere, the story and the characters. Belladonna is an enjoyable and definitely memorable, albeit short game :)",

            "review_text": "Atmospheric little Indie point and click. And by little i mean a game that can be completed in an hour, at first time. There isn't achievements to get, but there are cards. If point and click is your preferred genre, then this is a good addition to your library. But for people who want a quality point and click, there are much better alternatives for random point and click gaming moments.  Puzzles are pretty easy, the main emphasis in this game lies in the story, and it's pretty mediocre. You can easily guess the ending halfway through the game. And at times seems like the devs were going for different endings, but for some reason didn't. There were couple pretty clear points where you, as the main character was supposed to make choices. It wuold have added replayability to this otherwise linear point and click adventure.  It's a cool, bug free game thats fun to play through once. But not really worth many euros since you get only about an hour of linear playing, best to get with a bundle. I don't even have much to say about this game :D I just don't know what to say. It's pretty neutral in my eyes.  My thumbs up is mainly to give a positive score, since it isn't a bad game, it isn't especially dull actually. This game just exists. One hour of fun, and that's about it.",

            "review_text": " Pros and Cons list at the bottom of the review.   Belladonna is a decent point-and-click adventure, and it's low price tag makes it easier to recommend.   The story is not exactly inspired, somewhat of a generic 'Frankenstein's Monster' story, but it is passable. About halfway through the game you will likely have guessed the rest of the plot.   The game itself is only about 75-90 minutes long, depending on how fast you read and how much backtracking you have to do to grab items you didn't see the first time. Luckily, the game levels are not very large, so backtracking isn't much of a pain. The puzzles themselves are not too bad, I had an easier time with this game than some other point-and-click's where what you have to do next is very obscure.   The writing and voice acting are somewhat amateurish, though for the most part the journals you will read throughout the game were not too badly written. The main character's voice just sounded off to me, more like a young boy than a young woman's.   The graphics and aesthetics in the game are likely the best part of the game, and I thought everything was beautifully done. The only issue graphics-wise would be the walking animation. I didn't notice it too much until I was almost finished with the game, but the characters legs look strange when she walks, it does not work smoothly.   The biggest issue with the game would have to be the ending. I knew that I was nearing the end, but instead of finishing the storyline, it basically was one last click and then I was brought to a big 'game over' screen. The game was mostly wrapped up, but it needed a few more lines of dialogue and/or another cutscene to properly bring the game to an end. It was rather jarring.   Overall, for the asking price, especially if you can get it on sale, I would recommend this game if you are a point-and-click adventure fan.   Pros: +Graphics/Artstyle +Decent writing, if not as refined as one may like +Clear, non-frustrating puzzles +Low asking price  Neutral: +/- Short game length (can be a pro or con depending on the person's interest in the game)  Cons: -Not great voice acting  -Abrupt and unsatisfying ending",

The game is very short, I've done it in less than 1.5 hours reading all the letters and staring on every scene to enjoy it's beauty. The drawings are great in this game and strangely it seems like different scenes are drawn by different artists, at least 2-3 of them. Dut despite all these beauty it's only like 10 or so scenes in this game which is not much. As for the gameplay it's more like a story-driven waling simulator in a form of an adventure game. Yes it has more than just walking around but believe me it's barely 15-20 usable items in the game so it doesn't make any difference. Also the use of items is very logical which is a plus of course but the minus is you use it immediately very often, few pixels away from the place you found them.  Overall the story is interesting though not very original, game is well-made, art-style is great, diary pages are entertaining ro read but the game is very easy, short and lacks actual gameplay and also the game almost has no ending and looks like devs wanted to make more but decided to just cut the game to the The End screen at some point.",

PROS: + I loved the artwork and the general environment. + Music wasn't annoying, and voice acting was ok. + I liked the Steampunk vibe, the theme, and the story was cool. + References to Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe, which made me squeal in delight. + Easy and logical, there is no constant backtracking, no pixel hunt, and no nonsensical inventory combinations.  CONS: - Extremely short. I'm a VERY slow player, and I finished it in 2 hours, and that is including a pause I took for dinner while leaving the game on. - Too easy. Not one puzzle and not one remotely challenging situation. - The ending leaves lose ends, almost as if hoping for a sequel.  In short, if on sale, go for it. It's a nice hour and bit of a dark little story. But if you're into really challenging stuff, this one may bore you a bit. I still enjoy it and I'm not sorry I got it (then again, I got it for 0,69€).",

I was gifted this game during the winter sale - $7 is a bit steep for an extremely short game in my honest opinion so get it during sale time or when/if the game is improved with more content.  + a quick and easy game (point and click) - therefore its relaxing in a way + story was interesting and easy to follow + art is beautiful, especially for the small objects (though Klara's walking animation was a bit awkward) + music was pleasant and relevant  - I wish the writing on the letters were in bold/larger or an option to make the font verdana or tahoma to make it easier for blind ♥♥♥ gamers like me - super short game for $7  Adding in voices is always a huge plus when it comes to games as it adds to the experience while playing. But, I had to mute my laptop for a bit   when Belladonna started talking. Not that it was a horrible voice, it just felt very misplaced and awkward. Klara on the other hand was adorable. Maybe it was the stark contrast in the accents?   Despite that, from what I can see from the credits I am assuming the voices are all one person(?) so kudos to her!

The nods to literary greats like Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe were lovely, especially for bookworms like me! (There's also a character who is extremely reminiscent of the Bride of Frankenstein.)  The history and character information are fleshed out via journal pages/letters that you find while exploring. Each story is intriguing, with maybe one or two unexpected, little twists. While the style of the fonts were pretty, they were sometimes hard to read, but even I -- with glasses several years old -- read them just fine.  The music went well with the art style, and I appreciated some of the more dramatic moments. The voice acting was pretty good, not over-the-top or cheesy at all. Mechanics were easy and intuitive.  Overall, this is a great game for someone interested in a more casual point-and-click experience with a good amount of storyline. A bit short, but more than worth it for a sale price.",

I would have wanted to start with the pro's, rather than con's, but...there are very little pro's to it:  - the concept: it is sort of interesting, sadly it remained what it was, a concept; - SOME, and i mean SOME of the visuals are truly keeping up with the graphic style entirely; - voice acting: Klara is rather nicely acted, a nice voice to listen to actually;  CON'S  - game content and inherently its length: are you kidding me??? The game is made out of maybe not even 10 rooms! And some of them are only used as passage from an area to the other, while other contains just a note and nothing else! - story: the plot is almost entirely unfold through handwritten notes over and over AND over again. If that wasnt enough, they're just an image and therefore the font can't even scale up to proportion, and stays awfully small.  - puzzles: all of the puzzles are just a joke. They take seriously no time at all to figure out, and often you're even told plainly what to do. They're not even puzzles!  - some drawings: i chuckled as i saw Doctor's Wolf body. It has so many issues...and Belladonna isnt truly well drawn either. - animations: oh my freaking god. Klara literally fluctuates and has no interaction whatsoever with the surroundings. - overall lack of polish and care: room transitions carrying the description 'exit' or 'to the next room', truly short soundtrack looping over and over, lack of basic interaction. - the ABRUPT ending. There's not even a cinematic at the end. Just a colorful screen with an 'END' sign so you get it, at least....
