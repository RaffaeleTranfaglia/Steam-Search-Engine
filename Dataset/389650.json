            "review_text": "Pros: * Mechs have well defined roles (tank, ranged dps, melee dps, and evasion) which allows for synergy between players (tanks deflecting bullets and making everyone invincible to help those who are less familiar with this type of arcade-style game, sniper marking targets to take more damage from all sources, melee dps slowing time for everyone, ...) * Good amount of customization between picking a mech, a main weapon, and a sub weapon, which are all available immediately. Also frequent upgrades (usually 2) in the middle of levels that allow you to build towards your defined style (such as being a sniper and picking up crit upgrades) as well as a shop at the end of each level that allows for spending points towards more upgrades. * Tons of game customization (enemy durability, player shot speed, hibox radiuses, spawn rate, fire rate... just about all low level manipulation you can think of). Lots of presets available, so you can easily switch between 5 difficulties' worth of settings, as well as extra presets like 'Iron Man' where you have 0% shield multiplier. * Lots of environments - from frozen skies to exploding suns, underwater wrecks to alien hives, gas giants to robot factories, there's 10 locations in all with quite a bit of variety. * Can jump right in with the gauntlet mode - basically a never-ending mode (well, until you die) where you go for the high score.  Cons: * Story dialogue / plot is seemingly intentionally bad, but just ends up being unfunny and adding very little. Anime avatars for the characters seem a bit out of place. Wish I could turn it off entirely. * Would really benefit from having online multiplayer (as well as would probably sell a ton more copies. I know I'd be able to get some more friends to play it with me if it had online). * Achievements would be a nice touch, as it would give me more reason to play and try out all the mechs / weapons solo (and more reason to spend time in gauntlet mode).  Other: * Pretty quick game - around 2-3 hours. Want to call this a con, but can be a pro if you have trouble spending lots of time with friends after school/work since this game only has local co-op - it does mean you can beat this game in one sitting though, from start to finish. * Music is ok (opinion), although if I bought the soundtrack it'd probably only be for a few tracks (namely the last boss ones, because that fight had multiple phases and is pretty exciting)  Update Feb 2016 - it does look like they are listening to users, and they added a bunch of new upgrades, a new level, steam achievements and a bunch of other little features while I wasn't looking. Definitely a plus, and it rips out one of my few cons about the game.",

Among other things, here is what is awesome about this title: -Fully adjustable difficulty level (I played by myself, and with my 5 year old) -Tons of character customisation and upgrade options -Sence of humour, cool levles, fun soundtrack, great art...  Totally worth the money, imo.",

There a few small cosmetic glitches I have noticed (spacing of menu options) but this is quite rare. Played with K/M, but would be much better with a standard controller. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Will play much more in the future.",

            "review_text": "Not bad, considering this is their first game. The soundtrack is great, the choice for weapons is nice, enemy variety is nice, but it really shows that this is their first game Level progression is different backgrounds with enemies flying towards you in waves. There's even an endless wave mode you can play, which is nice to have. Bosses are okay. They aren't amazing, but they aren't bad. Overall, for their first shmup, it's passable. I feel I got my money's worth, though I also somewhat feel the soundtrack is as valuable as the game. The amount of options with regards to customizing the game is also nice, but I feel in the end it may have hurt them as I would rather have a very polished single form game than an unpolished 'you can do anything' game. The story is stupid, but I enjoyed it because it was self aware. However, nowadays, the 'I hold up my spork' kind of random stories are a dime a dozen.  That said, I feel there is a lack of polish on some things, which I imagine occurred due to this game being an amalgamation of ideas and the little bumps haven't been ironed out. The many pieces of the game don't really fit together. They're just...there. Like the different mech's special attacks. Largely unneeded as it's better to prioritize shooting your main weapon. The game needs focus.  This game is not a slow moving bullet hell like touhou (which I am glad for, as I do not enjoy that game), it's not a score/coin reward game like giga wing, and it's also not a strong level progression game like r-type or jamestown (though jamestown is a mix of story and coins, which was very highly polished).  I think that its main problem. It's not quite sure what it wants to be. Numbers pop up like crazy, so is it a reward kinda game? There's no coins, so my brain's reward center isn't happy. Level progression is lame and consists of different enemies on a slow moving background. There's no level elements like barriers or a finely detailed background that goes along with the enemies. At times it is a fast moving bullet hell game, which is great as the recharging shield mechanic makes the game frantic, but it's missing that polish to tie it all together.  The stupid story is kind of the epitome of this game - forgetable. But, it's ten dollars forgetable, and most importantly, it's not bad, so I feel I more than got my money's worth out of it. If they make a sequel I would be very highly interested, provided the above points were addressed.",
