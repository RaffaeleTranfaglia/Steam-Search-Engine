            "review_text": "Last summer I fired up BoN to see how well it still played. The overall impression is that it's still unique in its (very small) class of gladiatorial tactical TBS titles.  Imagine a sports manager game, tied to a tactical RPG scenario generator. That's what you're getting, and now you know if you're interested. If you've sunk dozens of hours into Out of the Park Baseball, and also played lots of slow-paced tactical RPGs, you'll probably play this sort of game -- and feel like it's an efficient way of getting both experiences at once.  The balance for the strategic game is quite good. There are always hard decisions to make about how to spend money, and even as you figure out the 'best strategy', it's still a lot of fun to see how well you can do using self-imposed restrictions that force you to try a completely different approach ('no archers, all magic', etc.)  The tactical engine is very simple, and missing many of the modern features that you might expect in a full-featured game. There are no fractional modifers for cover, or elaborate line-of-sight or elevation systems, and even terrain is minimally varied (passable vs impassable). Still, everything that's been attempted works very well, giving the game a nostalgic appeal that calls back to a 90s era console-based tactical rpg.  Nice features of the game include: * themed enemy teams (like a team of only one class) that all 'feel different', and are sometimes amusingly named * a 'press your luck' mechanic where you can sink lots of money into hiring short-term ringers -- which might pay off big, or might just waste a ton of money when you fall just short of the big prize * a realistic retirement system, which means you'll always want to keep developing new rookie stars and rotating them into the line-up * spells that encourage symbiotic relationships between the classes * lots of paths to success (big team vs small, magic vs melee vs ranged, speedsters vs bruisers)",
