Despite the amount of work that clearly had to go into balancing all the different variables of this game, there's not a whole great deal of gameplay when you get down it it. After some initial touch-and-go difficulty, I made it through my first election, and from then on it was a pretty steady rise until I'm 10 terms in, with no unemployment, no poverty, 100% of the vote and the highest possible GDP. I say this not to brag, but merely to demonstrate that you can ace this game on the first try.   In saying that, it took me 6 hours, which is as long as a CoD campaign and they ask $90 bucks for that. And it was nice to turn Australia into a profitable yet compassionate and sustainable nation.  Even so, I can't justify spending $20 on something that you can buy on the app store for your phone. But for the sale price, it's wonderful. I'd highly recommend getting the DLC, by the way, as without it, I'd feel like there was too little content, even for the sale price.",

Various policies, different groups, natural disaster, monarchy and so on. You can do a bunch of things to build the country in your own way. And at the same time, choosing different countries will also give you various scenerio. (in which i consider USA is the easist country, since it have the economic power).  After 8 hours or so, it was becoming bored to me, because there are just these policies (or maybe it's because I changed the difficulty to 40%). Then i found there are more things provided by the community. You can add more policies, countries and balance mods into this game.   However, there is a limit of policies and coutries available to be selected. And the gameplay is kinda one-dimensional. Overal   i still recommand this game  , despite you might be bored by these things after 20 hours.",

Rock solid game   144hz support and nice looking charts, layout, good design, etc   Fun variety of different political philosophies and policies   This game kept me playing for hours   Workshop has some cool add-ons    My chrome browser auto-loads  realclearpolitics.com  everytime its launched. If you don’t follow politics I don’t know that this game will be enjoyable for you. The fact is, the game is easier if you intuitively know what “biofuel subsidy” or “private school vouchers” are.   I would also say that the game is difficult. However, before starting a game you may reduce the difficulty. If you turn off assassinations the game becomes much easier and allows you to focus in on the policy.  At first I felt like the game forced me to play left, socialist. That’s not accurate, as a libertarian-leaning-conservative (right party for non-usa readers), I found my games always playing on the right side of the spectrum. Sure, I might subsidize the **** out of mass-transit to try to fix one of the “problems”, but overall I can’t help but gravitate towards my own belief of  what  government should do.  As a sim, the game puts you in charge of running the country like a business. This will cause you, or at least it did me, to abandon your precepts. I don’t believe government ought to tax behaviors like smoking; yet in the game they present a big red colored problem of asthma affected heavily by smoking. So to “beat” the game or solve this issue I tax the crap out of smoking. I don’t care if people want to get sick from smoking, and i certainly don’t think the government should be meddling in it.   The biggest reality problem is that you run the country as a limited-power dictator. There is no legislature or high-court to deal with. I think that for the scope of the game, this is a reasonable concession After all, who criticized Simcity because the mayor built a giant eco-friendly tower or a huge amusement park? I would suggest that we have a way to end game or retire out of governments like that of the UKs where you won’t term out. I would like to just “end” my carreer like when the US president terms out. I would also like to see a history of all my games and how they ended. I would also like a one-page summary that I can screenshot and post to steam (the current system doesn’t fit on the screen all at once).   The technical aspects of the game are good - given that the game is just texts and simple charts. At Least it runs at 144hz. I found the music obnoxious and play in silence. No crashes or other problems. Save system is fine.  ",

Things I like: •It is easy to align yourself with a specific ideology (capitalism, socialism, etc.). •The game is simplistic enough to understand, but still allows a general amount of micromanagement. •The game allows for easy modding and several of the mods look as if they were part of the game. •The DLC expands the game a great amount and is not very expensive.  Things I don't like: •The game feels a bit expensive and although I enjoy the game, I was skeptical of buying it. •The Extremism DLC is not expansive enough (i.e. it allows the ban of homosexuality if you choose, but not the ban of religion, which would be a sort of opposing idea). •It is ridiculuously easy to be assassinated in the game. You can only assume that you, as a leader of a country, have absolutely no protection and have a target on your forehead. For example, I decided that my country should have retinal scans for those entering the borders (it was a test) and I was assassinated the next turn. •The game is a bit simple when it comes to names for various groups. For example, if you are assassinated by an ethnic group, it will ALWAYS be the 'Black Power' group. This needs more diversity, as black people obviously do not represent all ethnic people.  Overall, I recommend this game, along with its DLC. However, I would wait for a Steam sale to purchase it at a discounted price, because I can't really imagine having a desire to purchase this game if it is over $15 USD.",

(This feature can be deactivated, but breaks the game if you do such. this includes making the game too easy.)  While, the game goes quite in-depth into actual policy integration, it lacks in the actual government structure. For example;  'the United States is bent around the two-party system, and the triad structure of government which includes congress, the president, and the supreme court. The game assumes that you no matter what policy you wish to implement all you need is the support of your cabinet of advisors in order to implement it, rather there should be conflict as you should have to work the system in order to implement such ideals. Including having to deal with congress.'  I still reccomend the game for pure idiology sake. It demonstrates the conflict and difficulties of trying to balance the opinions of the people while still making the country a better place.

            "review_text": "TL/DR Not a realistic politcal simulator, in my opinion, but it is fun once you realize it's a game and not real life.   Overall, I would rate it as follows:  GAMEPLAY/REALISM: (6/10) As stated above, not a completely realistic simulation but still enjoyable. Can be quite the challenge, watch out for fringe assassination groups. Also, it seems your own cabinet members are a challenge to appease.   GRAPHICS/PRESENTATION: (6/10) Very straightforward text based game with Solid layout that is very easy to navigate. Artwork is simple yet suites the game well.   OVERALL: (6/10) A solid game that offers plenty of options to fulfill one’s desire to lead a country to their liking. Not without room for improvement but enjoyable none the less. If you like political simulation games this should appease your desire to lead a nation, but don’t expect too much. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At first I disliked Democracy 3, having been assassinated three times in a row my frustration was growing exponentially. I suppose I came into the game with ideas of grandeur that were slightly unrealistic. Who wouldn’t want the deficit lowered to the point that it became a surplus and the general quality of life improved? Apparently it’s not that important. This makes the game challenging and that’s a “good” thing.   GAMEPLAY/REALISM The game is not overly complex but many issues are interconnected appropriately and increase the difficulty of the game. The game has a spider diagram with all issues and policies. Upon highlighting an issue or policy the interconnected nature is displayed, i.e. increasing the Petrol tax will gain influence with Environmentalist but will negatively affect middle income families due to the direct increase to their cost of living. Frankly, it’s setup well to easily navigate between many different issues to change the country for the better or appease a particular political group.  In regards to artificial intelligence, I seriously doubt that it would be so easy to assassinate a leader of a country, especially a large one like the US. Also, I have a problem with the frequency of cabinet members becoming dissatisfied with executive policy to the point that they step down. Having an option to establish your platform at the beginning of the game would probably fix this and would be a beneficial addition in my opinion. I suppose there is an element of this based on the party you select but it’s not customizable. For the most part, all major policies and issues are covered. It is very easy to customize budget allocation and political preferences, i.e. lowering spending on military or increasing corporate taxes. Overall, the game is very fluid but in many ways it’s not realistic. It seems the best strategy is one of balance between the different political factions. Sadly, it seem all you do is try to appease everyone to survive, literally.    GRAPHICS/PRESENTATION Simple yet fluid, with a plethora of information displayed in an easy to read format. I can’t say that the graphics were very complex or cutting edge but they suited the game well enough to not become a distraction to gameplay. Overall, the graphics don’t really matter and the presentation of the game is excellent.   OVERALL The game could be much better, but it does offers enough to satisfy most political simulation fans. I can’t say it’s realistic but it isn’t simple either. It is very satisfying to erase a deficit or completely abolish crime, but the repercussions of political change seems overly skewed towards minority political groups. In the end it’s more about surviving by appeasing and less about political progression. This really holds the game back from being an outstanding political simulation game. I realize that the designers wanted a difficult game, because political issue are very complex and impactful on life, but a missing element is the ability to persuade and inspire your virtual citizens.",

I did very well with making all the voters love me for about 3 elections my first run, but I'm pretty sure I ran my country into horrible debt because I wasn't paying attention to my money which caused me to lose my 4th election. My only real problems with the game however is changing the resolution and the start up. Every time I change the resolution, I have to close the game and restart it to have the changes take effect. I'm not sure if this is just my laptop being sh*t as per usual or if this is a problem among multiple players. Also, on start up, Steam constantly does the first time set up even though I've opened the game multiple times already. I have no idea why it's doing that. Again, it could be my laptop, but I might as well mention it if it's not. All and all, regardless of my problems, I love this game and would definitely recommend giving it a try even to politically apathetic people like myself.",

Gradually taking away all the social rights, and liberties that the Chinese had, felt really good and satisfying. After just 12 years in office the semi-communist country was turned into a capitalist candyland where money, gambling, drugs, alcohol and prostitution were the cornerstone of the society. Just like most of the western countries once strived to be.   I also had a go with Germany, turning it inro a police state faster than Angela Merkel could ever dream of at night. All liberty was taken away, granting them forced labour and minimum wages in return. Such fun!  Want to turn France into a military powerhouse? Now you finally can! Want to see if the USA is ready for a more European approach towards society? Now you can, but beware of the capitalist plots against you.  I had so much fun playing this game and I'm already fantasizing about my next plan with a new country. Gameplay can get repetitive after being stuck in the same menu all the time.

Everything is represented through nodes: policies(police force, grants, tax, law and order, etc), statistics or 'simulation'(CO2 emissions, crime, poverty, etc) and situations (technological advance or obesity. Every decision you take through policies will have various consequences on simulations and each simulations will influence other. For example, if you implement police drones, crime will lower, causing prisons to cost less but it will also anger liberals. And if you keep rubbing them the wrong way, they might radicalize and an extremist group might just assassinate you. Another core part of the game are situations. If your policies go a certain way, they won't just cause simulations to adjust. They will trigger situations which will have much more effects. For example, if racial tension grow at the same time as unemployement, you might trigger race riots, hurting the economy and upsetting the conservatives, maybe destroying your popularity and making you lose your reelection. Everything is connected and it is always fun to experiment various ideological programs. Try to make the USA into a eco-friendly paradise, Australia into a socialist festival, France into a theocratic state or Germany into a fasc... Nope, forget that one.  Now... What is not Democracy 3? It is not an election simulator. If you do well, it is quite easy to achieve stalinian results in the election. Democracy 3 is about governing and influence society through state decisions. It is not an geopolitical simulator. Foreign affairs are quite limited. The focus is on domestic affairs. It is not a universal political simulator. Everything is based on the western world + Australia (therefore, dominantly white and christian). It is not a scientifically accurate simulator. There are no precise datas. Everything is about plausibility, tendancies It is also not an AAA game. The team behind it includes one coder and one graphic artist. Take it into account! It is not a doctrinal game. Meaning, you can't expect a very precise political agenda to work without a scratch. You need to be pragmatic, adress crisis, think about costs and benefits. Trying radical approaches without carefully considering various factors and consequences is a leap of faith.  So, should you buy it? Definitely if you enjoy politics and are looking for a challenging but not overly serious experience. Also worth to notice that modding D3 is quite easy. There are numerous mods deepening the gameplay or offering fun new challenges.  What about those DLC? Social Engineering: nice but a bit halftone (it was the first). Buy it if you really enjoy the game. Maybe on a sale. Extremism: a big yes! This DLC brought a lot of fun in democracy by allowing you to go EXTREME! A must-have if you enjoy the game. Clones and Drones: a DLC about futuristic issues and policies. It is a great addition because it upsets the balance you can achieve in the base game. Problems will come and you might not expect them.

I turned Canada into a theocracy one game, just because I felt encouraged to by the game set up and design.  There's a lot of potential here, and the developers are actively working on the game.

While getting used to the UI is pretty quick, it can be a bit cumsersome to always have to navigate one's way around the sliding arrows in order to get the full information that one needs.  Also, beeing able to have a flat income tax AND a progressive tax at the same time feels a bit like a cheat, altough it makes wonders to correct the budget deficit.

The goal is to get yourself re-elected for another few years or so with another candidate competing against you (at least that is what I interpret), To do so you need to get the citizens of whatever nation you choose to lead to vote in favor of you by adjusting things relating to law, health, taxes, etc. to favor the party of your choice, the parties consisting of one group and their counterpart, ranging from motorists to environmentalists to capitalists and democrats as well as others such as parents, farmers, wealthy, middle class, poor, etc.  However, simply adjusting certain things in the game is not the only thing that happens, that would make things too easy. You have a cabinet of your own whom all also favor one group or another and may leave or work ineficciently if your actions do not favor their party. You can fire them if you wish but that would require hiring a new person for that spot which isn't bad, however the people you have to pick will not have as much experience in work as your previous one, for the longer they work the more better experience they have. Your cabinet also gives political capital, which is basically how much power you have each turn. You use political capital to act on whatever you choose act on like taxes or education etc.. Depending on how drastic a change may be, one may require more capital than the other, it would take much more capital to legalize narcotics or make gun laws less strict than it would to raise taxes. You can also enact policies which take no capital until adjusted.  Conflict may also occur in the game as well. For example, you can never favor every party at once, if you decide to stop the production of roads, for example (I couldn't think of a better example at the time I was writing this) you will anger the motorists and they may not vote for you, but the environmentalists will be pleased because this means less car usage which in turn means less pollution. Angry parties won't do much but not vote for you but if you cross the line against a party, they may send you a threat and you could be assassinated, leading to game over.  You'll also need to take note of the consequences your actions may take, you may decide to raise taxes on alcohol and lower the drinking age, this will profit you due to the fact that more people may be drinking if not stirred by the tax, but all the alcohol could lead to violent crime which you may need to raise security on, spending more money! You also run the risk of alcoholism being a problem. Other problems may arise in the game every few turns or so like asthma or homelessness. These issues are dealt by working on what causes said issues. Asthma is caused by pollution and the main source of pollution is cars so you can try to decrease car usage and help the epidemic.  Other things you might want to watch out for is your money, which is also taken on most policies and enactments. You want to watch your money otherwise you could be in more debt and lose your credit rating and decrease your chances of being voted for. Each turn you also have actions in the form of situations dealt with one decision but two questions such as freedom of information, yes or no? You also have intelligence that watches the parties in case any try to assassinate you but their effectiveness is based on how much money you put into them.  Overall, it's a sophisticated game and I highly reccommend it",

            "review_text": "Democracy 3 is a splendid game, that is in its essence hardly a game as it feels more like a policy simulator. However, it is a very extensive and amusing policy simulator.  So what is the game about? In Democracy 3 you pick a country of your own choosing and become the president of its freshly elected government. Your task is to manage your country any way you see fit. Want to create a socialist utopia? You can do it, comrade. More enchanted by the prospects of a unlimited free market with limited government intervention? Go and cancel all those nasty free market deterring subsidies. However, none of these actions is without consequences and if you want to get re-elected you will need to keep all segments of society happy (well at least a bit happy, if you do not want to be assassinated by a motorist group because you thought it was fun to ban cars from cities). To do this you have an array of policies available which you can micromanage via sliders depending on how widespread a policy should be. If you introduce CCTV cameras in your country you can choose to have them “at every corner” (hello,   1984  ) or you can have them placed at only known crime spots. The choice is yours.   The core of the game thus focusses around balancing sliders to get those extra voters or that extra amount of tax revenue without having an open revolt. This aspect of the game can be perceived by some people as negative since the game largely revolves around spreadsheets and sliders and does not visually communicate the effects of your policies. Literally everything is presented through either text, symbols or graphs. Therefore, this game is not for those who want to be shown the effects of policies in a visual manner such as other games – like SimCity – do.  Therefore, my advice is that if you always wanted to know what it feels like to manage a modern democracy then this game is just for you. However, if you dislike spreadsheets and enjoy a game that is more visual in communicating the effects of your policies then this game might not be for you. And if you are really not certain then you can always wait and pick this game up when it is on sale: it is certainly worth a try.",

While you have a few countries to choose from and lots of policies (especially with the DLC), you find yourself bored in the sessions at times because the gameplay is static screens. While I can live with this, at times the game becomes too liberal at base value. This game was clearly made with liberal intent instead of an unbias one. I say this because citizens become violent and angry at the slightest conservative policies. However, most of the time, liberal policies meet little resistance or strange niche violence.   This game, is like my review, all over the place. It's fun and a bit educational but this is macro-politics at best. I recommend this game to anyone because it really is fun to have the power and gives different perspectives from many political alignments. But this game could be way more than what it is.

Democracy 3 is less entertaining but more educative. There are no cutscenes, there is no story, there aren´t even animations. So if you want to have fun, this is not the game to try. Instead of controlling life-events as you might expect, you will have to read and wait, a whole lot.   Democracy 3 is a complex simulation, confrontating you with one of the most difficult exercises in the World:   Leading a state.   As easy as it seems, it´s not. Everything you do can have strong consequences, each solution will result in a new problem. There are always tons of things to take care about, simultaniously. Like in the real world nothing works as it should. While you are trying to count as many voters at possible, your whole government can be ruined one day to annother, just because of one simple aspect you did not think of early enough. There are crysises, natural catastrophies, riots, assassinations or even worse things, making it hard for you to develop a solid economy. Before I played this, I wouldn´t ever have thought of the difficulty beeing president.   So, in conclusion I can absolutely recommend Democracy. It´s a well made, realistic simulation. For all, who are interested in politics this is totally worth the price, for some others this could also be interesting when on mass sale, while Hardcore-Gamers or Action-game-players should definately stay away from this, since Democracy 3 hasn´t any gameplay at all.  One last thing: When playing Democracy you should be pretty good at speaking english, because the translation isn´t complete. There are a lot of sections, such as the integrated guide, that are only available in english. To the fact this is an educative game, the grammar is pretty advanced and the texts are using uncommon words. If you are new to the game you might not understand the basics, the toturial is short and reduced to the minimum. That made it pretty hard for you to be successfull here.

It's a balancing act of sorts, and although it may sound like an oversimplification, it really isn't.  A good developer would mask the simplicity of a game with enough layers of complexity. In democracy there are no layers of complexity, it's an X-Ray of a skeleton.  How you play the game is 'slide this to make X group happy and ♥♥♥♥ off Y', then 'Slide this to reduce Y group membership and increase it in group Z'.  The functionality of the game is lacking too. Something that jumps out at me straight away is the Save option. Why aren't any of the current saves selectable? In order to save your current America game, you have to type out the name of the save you used last time (if you wish to use the same save of course). At which point upon 'selecting' a save name, you will be promoted to OVER-WRITE the existing file name. Yeah.... so why the heck didn't you see this as a lacking feature and just make them selectable so you can over-write in two simple clicks?  The theme of the game is far from the videos. Do not be fooled! The one where the eloquent American politician is speaking - with an morally strong and positive outlook - is not at all what the game really feels like. It has numerous loading screens per round with quotes by famous people. Quotes which are mostly, if not all absolutely cynical. And that is very important that you understand this.  The game has a cynical sense of humour and it just feels out of place. It just carries this bitter vibe which speaks about the creator's world view.

Everybody has their own dream utopia and even though the developer has done a good job his personal opinions still manage to shine through. The consequences of certain actions and policies are not realistic compared to real life examples.   2: Budgets   I find it really hard to maneuver the economic sliders in this game. It is hard to understand just how much money I need to make something work properly and how much I can spend without breaking my budget. The result is an ever present feeling of always thinking that you are spending a bit too much or not enough.   3: Ministers  The game has only one resource, Political Capital. You obtain it through your ministers every turn. Each minister has their own political allegiances and for some reason you are not allowed to pick the ones you like before you start your term. I often found their loyalty to crumble eventually and I never quite figured out how to assemble the most effective cabinet. Overall it felt like an annoying distraction from the main game.   4: DLC  With such a minimalistic game I would have expected there to be more nations aviable to play. Packaging a series of additional policies and events that should have been present in vanilla as 5€ DLC is not in any way okey.",

I bought it because I liked the concept that everything influences everything and that you gotta keep balance on everything. This is a huge plus of the game, while I found the rest more or less disappointing.  After some rounds you find yourself just clicking from turn to turn (each turn equals 3 months) to gain more political influence, which you can use to introduce new policies. That is quite monotonous, since nothing really happens except for some decisions you gotta make (i.e. allow fracking yes / no; appoint a more open-minded / conservative judge, etc...).  What disturbs me most is that it does not really reflect the way a democracy works, at least not how I perceive it. In the beginning you can choose the country you want to gouvern, that slightly changes the starting circumstances, but no matter which country I choose, I get the feeling that the system of Democracy 3 is influenced a lot by the American 'democracy'. There will be only 2 parties and as the 'ruler' you have the full power over the political system. You do not have to justify towards your party. I expected that as a leader of a socialist party my party members would punish me for abolishing social welfare, but that does not happen.  Furthermore, since you always need to get the majority of votes, you are obligated to make moderate politics (which makes the extremism extension quite useless imo). The last thing is that the game is really easy. The first election is always difficult to win, but since most policies have more positive than negative influence and you can introduce more and more of them, from the second election up to the future I won with &gt;95% of the votes (which is completely unrealistic). The economy is not THAT easy to handle, but it is possible and as long as you don't lose yourself in debts, it's okay and not punished very much.  Overall, the game has some nice ideas and features, is overall quite well balanced, but lacks depth and what I thought would be 'endless possibilities'.",

Cons: - Games are very short, usually about 1 – 2 hours long. - Not enough nations in the game and also the difference between is only slight. - Poor tutorial which allows the player to play but does not explain everything. - Elections should be more intense and have some form of adding / boost candidate numbers. - An expensive game for its playing time and outdated look.

It isn't worth it for 5€, and it sure as hell isn't worth it for 23€(!).   Democracy 3 is a game about, well, democracy. There are several groups of people (socialists, capitalists, liberals, conservatives, religious, parents, youths, motorists, etc.) and each one has its own demands and characteristics. As a governant, you might try to get the votes of one of those groups, but you will, inevitably, displease another. Hey, that's what democracy is about: a constant balance between different social classes' needs and demands.  The problem is, there isn't much more to the game. Democracy 3 isn't about politics in the machiavellian sense. There are only two parties, yours and your opponents, but it's like they don't even exist until it's elections' time. They just don't play any relevant role in the game. Want to implement a new policy? Here's this thing called 'Political Capital', which generates every turn, to get things rolling. Indeed, there is no parliament in this game. There is no constitution, no judges, no president, no angry mobs trying to get your head. In short, THERE IS NO OPPOSITION. As long as you have the boring, mind-numbing, one-dimensional resource that is Political Capital, you can do what you want.   And that makes it a very simplistic game. Sure, there is some challenge in this game. After all, you need to have a positive budget in this game. You need to find a way to please different groups and ministers, while staying true to your political project. You need to adress different problems that may arise during your gameplay, such as crime, low productivity, or homelessness. But the way it is done is so simple and boring, you can't help but keep thinking 'Isn't there more to it than this?' all the time, while getting disappointed at the end. Because no, there isn't much more to it.   This is what you do: You start a new turn, you solve whatever dillema that shows up (for example, legalize euthanasia, yes or no), you spend your Political Capital on new policies or adjusting old ones, you end turn, and you repeat that all over again. That's it. Start a turn, spend Political Capital, end turn, repeat. That's all you do. Oh, and those dillemas don't seem to make any noticeable impact in the game whatsoever.   It is a very repetitive system. It's actually interesting in the first turns, when you're learning how to play the game. But then you realize that there isn't a goal to this game. You can't win, you can just keep from losing (which happens by being assassinated or losing next elections, which, once you get the hang of this game, just won't happen). There is no motivation to keep going except to win achievements (which are pretty easy to do). Hear me, developers: just implement a scenario type of game, where you have to do things like solve poverty in 10 turns, while pleasing to capitalists or something like that. It would make the game so much more interesting and challenging. In other words, it would have a point.   Unfortunately, there isn't anything like that. There is only a 'make your own goal' type of gameplay, but unlike Minecraft, there isn't a lot of room for creativity here, besides making your own fundamentalist or communist country, or something like that.   There aren't a lot of different nations either. They are few, but at least they have different cultures, and so you have to play differently depending on what nation you're on. That's a plus (until the part you realize that some things have no effect whatsoever in your gameplay, like Monarchy). Other positive aspects of the game are the interface, which is pretty and clean, but it has some issues here and then. It might be confusing at times, because you're never sure whether the green colour in an Unemployment or Crime slider means more or less Unemployment or Crime (it means more, but it is still confusing). In the Tutorial, the adviser window overlaps the main window, and it blocks things you'd want to read or do, and there is no way to move or minimize it, just quit it. It's bad. However, overall the interface is positive.   So is the amount of detail in the game, with text explaining every policy, statistic or effect. I was never confused about what was happening. It is probably the best thing about this game: It is a great educative tool for those who want to get introduced to politics. It is, however, very poor as a game, and I hope there are some mods out there to correct its faults.    Conclusion: It is a niche product, better as an educative tool than as a game. Don't buy it for more than 5€, and that may be pushing it.",

Do stuff like raise agriculture subsidies to get the farmer vote, etc. etc. That doesn't happen. As long as you govern well- keep the deficit+debt down, keep crime low, don't let wages drop too much, etc - you'll do fine in the elections (And I've cranked the difficulty up to max). Theres next to no political maneuvering- at least no political maneuvering to secure votes.  No matter how happy everyone else may be, if one group gets too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, they'll attempt to assasinate you. And in this game, the secret service couldn't stop a 5 year old with a bb-gun. Also, your ministers, who give you political capital which determine the amount of policies you can enact per turn, can turn on you if you ignore their interests. It may force you to make selfish, politically driven decisions, but it feels fake.   It's really fun for the first few hours, whether you're screwing around or playing seriously. The options, difficulty settings, and different countries extend the replayability, but unless you're interested in domestic policy (which I am) the interest probably won't last more than a few hours.

Firstly, the game has utterly ridiculous simulations for party support. In a democratic society, parties will essentially never get above 80% support in an election, but when I got good I could consistently get above 90% support every election, no matter what I did with the settings.  Secondly, the demographic sliders are effed. I played around with some farm subsidies and social security, and made it so that 100% of my population was both farmers and retired. While hilarious, this is not desirable in a simulation game.  Thirdly, I broke the game when I realized that the key to victory was eliminating all taxes and spending immense amounts of money on every frivolous program ever. That's right, folks, this simulation game has absolutely no limits on how much money you can borrow, essentially no inflation mechanic, and just generally seems to have been farted out by a developer who doesn't know anything about how an economy functions and couldn't care less!  It was hilarious constructing my taxless utopia of retired farmers, but I ultimately can't recommend.",
