            "review_text": "This game is meant for people who are willing to come back a couple times a day and check on their biodome(s). If you don't like that, this game may be tough to find fun. However, if you are willing to check back every so often, the game has incredibly well designed ecosystem development and many options for flora and fauna for each of its (currently?) three biome types (in vanilla). The gameplay is mostly placing animals and plants in a custom ecosystem you create from scratch. The longer it works and the more diverse you make your miniature worlds, the more the game rewards you with coins, which let you unlock new animals, plants, etc. Be careful though, as fast breeding grasses and rabbits can overrun the entire environmental plan you thought you had set up, or the extra foxes you put in ate all the herbivores and starved. The only constant is that no plan ever works out perfectly, as the interactions always tend to surprise you each time you log back in. The camera feature gives you extra oppertunities to do some non-ecological work, such as taking snapshots of a bunch of baby hares roaming around in your custom made desert bush garden, or peeking at a sleeping turtle.   The devs are wonderful, active, and more friendly than every other early access devs I have ever talked to. A simple email or a forum post will get their attention, and they will contact you in a timely manner with support and/or response to your feedback.   At this time, however, there are certain things that I found midly troublesome (not to say they ruined my experience, but these small things could greatly improve my gameplay). Listed below: -clipping (animals can go inside of large trees, making it hard to spot them as well as slightly damaging the realism the game is going for) -swimming for animals. Not just for realism (which would be amazing in its own right), but because like the tree clipping, it can be hard to spot animals 'buried' beneah water. Again with both issues (this and tree clipping) it isn't a huge concern, due to the fact that the need to see individual animals is somewhat small, but it would be nice to keep track of certain smaller populations (such as bobcats or foxes) on a more precise and individual scale without having to look inside of large trees (such as kapok). -not being able to pan the strategic camera (the top down view) while trying to place animals or plants (this is now possible! thanks againt devs!) -not being able to see which population I'm being alerted about (a snap to function would be amazing) Again, this game is lots of fun and functions as a good creative outlet, and for 7$ it is easily worth the cost. Please support these wonderful devs! (please remember this review was written in later summer of 2016, and despite my efforts to update this review I will not always be on top of any fixes that the dev team makes)",

            "review_text": "Edit : Ok after feedback from the Devs i've gone back and taken another look.  Pro's : Devs that are really responsive to thier users. Mushrooms! Unlike some other spawns the mushrooms appear randomly around the biome within the spawn radius. A good veriety of creatures and plants etc. Camera is better after 1.6 update.   Con's : Static spawns such as butterflies. I guess it would be very resource intensive to have hundreds of individual butterflies but the current alernative seems to be a small cloud that just stay it the spawn point. Poor AI. I find it annoying to place some plants and herbivores and then a single carnivore and then sit and watch as the carnivore strolls around the group of prey and they dont respond at all. Shouldnt they try to hide in vegitation or at least try to move away from the predator? Water looks terrible even on the highest setting. Its like a slightly animated oily mirror.  Lastly and this is just my personel preference but the pace is just so slow with little to keep me interested. I want to like the game but i get bored very quickly. Dont assume i dont have patience either... I just stopped playing a virtual cactus growing game!   For me it needs a lot more to keep me interested. Maybe more stats and data on your biomes and inhabitants. Better AI would make the interactions between creatures more interesting. Maybe speed up the ability to unlock more stuff early on to add more variety. I like that you need to work for progression but early game its to slow to keep me interested.  So in summary, i looked again after the 1.6 update and although the camera control is a big improvement i'm sorry to say i still cant recommend this game as it just isnt something i want to play yet.  I will look at the game again after more updates.   [Old Review]  I didnt like it. I usually love this type of game but this just left me feeling very bored and disappointed. Graphics are pretty poor and need more and smoother animations. Gameplay isnt there yet either as you place a few plants and then plant eaters and throw in a carnivore or 2 and then sit back and wait.... and wait.... and wait... and ok i'm bored. Yes the foxes eat the rabbits and the rabbits eat the plants and the insects/worms do the biodegradable what not but what do i do... its boring...  Sorry not for me.",

            "review_text": "First off, this game isn't an edge of your seat, action packed game... which you should have been able to tell from the title. If you liked Zoo Tycoon, Sim Park, or any of those other old wildlife simulation titles... be prepared for a bit of a nostalgia trip.  The gameplay is failry straightforward. you start with an empty biodome. At present, there are three to choose from- Desert, Grassland, and Rainforest. The Desert biodome is based on the American Mojave Desert (for those FO: NV fans reading this, NO there is not an option to include radioactive mutated wildlife), and the Grasland biodome is based on the Great Plains of the United States. The Rainforest biodome, in contrast, is based on the Amazon rainforest of South america.   Once you choose a Biodome to work with- and you can have multiple biodomes at once- it is your job to create a functioning ecosystem. Word of advice- start by unlocking as many plants as you can first, as you start with a pollinator and there is no way to 'make space' for new plants later on. Also, it will make keeping you dome healthy easier in both the short and long run. Reproduction is handled simply but realisticly, in the sense that while there are no mating animations, the time periods and litters are scaled to their real-world time periods as much as possible. This, combined with the lack of gore, makes the game very kid friendly and educational. A predator will kill prey by simply running up to them and delivering a quick bite. No blood is involved.   Importantly, you only start with a single section of your biodome available for use; you must unlock the other areas through use of ingame 'tyto tokens' which are earned at the end of every ingame week. You CANNOT purchase these coins- you must earn them, and the number of coins you earn is based on the health and biodiversity of your biodome. There is no pay to win feature here. Incidentally, these coins are also how you unlock new species to place in your biodome. Also important to note, animal territories that extend into another section of the biodome can and will take resources from the section they extend into. Place your territories carefully.   Other than these tips, I will leave you to discover the fun by yourself. The game is fun and relaxing, and can be enjoyed at your own pace. The developers are VERY interactive with their community, and problems are answered propmtly and quickly. One quick thing- 'Tyto' happens to be the genus name for  Tyto alba , the barn owl. The game is called Tyto Ecology, and your inagme avatar is a cute little robot called the owlbot. Do the math. ;)",

            "review_text": "This is one of the most realistic ecology simulators I have ever played. It teaches players about looking ahead to see the consequences of their actions. If even one thing is out of balance, the whole ecosystem will collapse, which is just like real life. The devs are also really helpful. When you post a bug, they get back the exact same day almost every single time. They are very friendly, unlike in other games where the devs are mean and refuse to accept your advice.   Right now, the game is just a seed with so much potential to grow. The more people that play this game, report bugs, and share their screenshots, the more that seed grows into a beautiful tree.

But after getting in to the game unlocking more animals,plants and areas the game really begins to move faster as you decorate and plan were things will go on your biome",

If you have a multi-monitor setup,DO NOT pass this game up,as its a fantastic game to have running while you are playing something else.For me this is gonna be a great 'Sunday Morning' game to play while having my coffee and catching up on house chores type of game,because you can walk away from it for 15 minutes and not go apocalypse on you and have things to do when you get back to it.You have to pay attention to whats going on management-wise but you don't need to babysit it.Although i only have 2 sections of the 5 in the Biome open so when they are all open it might get nutty.  I have not played very long as of this writing (2 months gametime),but i really like it so far.I can't wait to make a bad decision and see the results.  I have suggested to my daughter to recommend this game to her old biology teacher as a possible class experiment/project.  ",

            "review_text": "Simple in every aspect. Don´t expect a complex simulation sandbox.  A simple calculation of the food chain and it´s balance graphicly presented. Placing territorys in reach of needed foodsources, maintain a certain balance, unlock species through achievement coins.. beside the simple animations nothing really happens you could watch, while you wait for passing time. Controls are awful. Interface is sufficient. The educational content is the better part of this software, though no mechanic guides you through or links you to, and it is relatively basic as well.   So, i would like to recommend this software, because i appreciate the genre and would like to see more, better and complex kind of this. But i barely would call this either simulation, game or well made. ..for me.  Edit: Ok, now i feel a bit sorry for my negative vote, as i´ve done some research. I think it is important to make games not just fun, but also relevant for the player and the 'real' world. So, i like to appreciate this project, but, assuming i´m just not the targeted audience for this game, there are still some aspects, which are especially important, if you focus (mainly) for kids to keep them entertained while motivate and facilitate research. So, i find it still not so well executed, yet. I would be fine with the progress of the game, if it wouldn´t be released as final game. Though, this might be due to ressource reasons.. So, i quarrel with myself, whether i should recommend and promote or rate and demand. :/",

            "review_text": "I haven't played that much yet, but so far it feels like the game is worth it's price. You have to build a working eco system out of different kind of animals and plants, with everything serving it's purpose in the eco system. The beginning of the game seems easy. The difficulty will probably come once you have unlocked the whole dome (playable area) and filled it with all sorts of animals etc.  I do like the music in this game. Although there doesn't seem to be a big variety in different background tracks (2-3?) they fit the game very well, are relaxing and don't feel like being forced onto you. The tracks remind me a bit of the tracks from Simcity 4 and City Skylines.   However there are 2 downsides I would like to mention at the moment. There is little to no sound effects. Only when you click on an animal it will make it's distinctive sound and obviously normal mouseclicks on the interface make a sound. Other than that, you only hear the music playing.  The animations and AI seem a bit strange at times. Sometimes you do see bobcats hunting and killing rabbits for example. But sometimes their hunger bar just fills while they are standing moveless at the border of the dome.  Overall and due to a lack of alternatives, I would say the game is definitely worth the little price it costs.  ",

            "review_text": "As someone with a keen interest in ecology and biodiversity I can appreciate what this game is trying to achieve. Unfortunately, as with the majority of educational titles, it fails to deliver a polished and engaging experience.  The user interface, while relatively clean and simple, doesn't feel polished and rather more like a indie phone app. A lack of tooltips make figuring out what each component of the interface does a bit of trial and error. While some of this is covered in the brief tutorial, it would have been a nice feature to include especially as the game is probably marketed to a young demographic.  A lack of transparency regarding the statistics of your biome was dissapointing. Again, some of this was accessible by manually clicking through each population however it would have been nice to have some sort of central overview of the correlation between all components of your ecosystem. I found myself wondering what aspects of my biome were causing decreases and increases to my biodiversity, so some sort of indication as to the source of these fluctuations would have been welcome.  Visually I was actually impressed. While the graphics certainly would not win any awards I can see that a reasonable effort has gone into art and animation, which could likewise have been easily overlooked in such a title. An inability to remap controls was disappointing.  Unfortunately the fun factor here was minimal at best. There was no real incentive to do anything, other than to keep your biome health up. I really liked that a comprehensive database of information regarding each component was included, much like how Age of Empires and the Civilisation series have consistently included in-depth information, but when there's no actual fun to be had alongside this feature you may as well just read a book on the subject.  Overall I would recommend this to someone who has absolutely no concept of the basics of biodiversity as an extremely basic educational tool. I feel bad giving this a negative review because I really support education in interactive media but there are a number of areas where this game falls short. I guess I can buy my guilt off knowing I paid for the title and supported the developer in some small way.",

[04/18/2016] – Final Review Tyto Ecology is a very intriguing idea where your role is that of god-like being able to place plants, animals, and decomposers as you see fit. However, you are limited in how much you can do with the creatures and biomes; like you cannot shape the terrain nor can you give commands to anything to do something. You are just trying to maintain a balanced eco-system as you fill up the map. That is, if you were able to do that…at all.  The game has a cool idea, but it is hard for me to even call it a game at all. With about 19 hours of gameplay, I was only involved with maybe 5 hours; a few of which I forced myself to play just for this review. The first few hours are fun to mess around with stuff and watch your biome burn from a lack of understanding, but even after reading through the only information given in a form of an index (which I assume is accurate scientific data for the biomes and etc.) you will still be scratching your head wondering why your biome cannot maintain itself except past a certain point. Which becomes a common theme. And it doesn't help that the majority of your time in Tyto Ecology will be spent just waiting…and waiting…and waiting….and waiting…for something to happen.  The game is still un-optimized and contains bugs that will lower your framerate to a slug’s pace (even on my $5000.00 pc), making it un-playable. It has many of the drawbacks of a mobile game where you feel like a lot of decisions for the pace and mechanics of the game were made in the thought of micro-transactions (there are not micro-transactions on PC).   There also isn’t enough information for the player, like given in Sim City or City Skylines, for you to digest or to understand (mechanical information) and even when your waiting for “x” to happen, there is nothing for the player to do (besides reading all the scientific facts of the creatures and plants).   There is also a lot of annoying features and tools that should be in the game, but are missing; like being able to rotate and move the camera while placing objects or being able to rotate larger objects, like trees, a certain way. It just isn’t fun to play after the initial look, you will find yourself doing other things the majority of the time while this is alt+tabbed in the background.   The developers have been extremely active which is great and makes it more painful for me to say, but this game is not worth $5.00 and you should only really play Tyto Ecology if you’re the type of person who enjoys playing a game, or multiple games, periodically throughout your day.    [04/16/2016] - Initial Entry Before I give the game a proper review, I currently cannot recommend this title as there are some game breaking bugs that either make it unplayable or very frustrating to play. I will revise this review as updates come out.",
