            "review_text": "It seems like I've been choosing the games with the feels to play for a while. First  Serena , then  Cahors Sunset , and now  Labyrinthine Dreams ... This is starting to become a habit. I wouldn't like to seem like a tragedy junkie. I just wished to play an RPG maker game, and look what it has done to me: all teary eyed and big with the decision on Carpe Diem!  In  Labyrinthine Dreams , our protagonist is Beth; a young woman who is crippled with anxiety, due to the timeless death of her father. In many ways, she is terrified that she may end up just like him. She is trying to deal with judgement, apathy and depression while recounting the events of her life from a dreamlike perspective. She travels within many dream fragments that symbolize both important moments of her life and her hopes, dreams and fears: namely her inner world. Within those dreams, she constantly tries to escapes from a monster, a dark creature that comes after her. For every step that Beth takes, the monster can take two. Is she doomed to end up in the grasp of her inner demon despite whatever she tries?  The gameplay is the marriage of a visual novel and a refreshing selection of movement puzzles. Puzzles are decent, and takes some time to figure all if you were not to use a guide. I'd like to add that, every detail that you come across, alongside with the nature of puzzles you solve, the game world is genuinely symbolic. You shouldn't expect a straight forward story consistency. The story works around the linear concept that you expect from an RPG maker game. For example: for the first puzzle that you come across - The Forest - you are not allowed to make left turns. It gave me the sense that Beth is forced to abide by the expectations of society: one way only. There should be millions of other paths that she could take to finish the labyrinth, but she is forced to use a single one. Beautifully thought!  There isn't much free will, but Beth's tale is so ordinary, so real and everyday; I found no problem on emphasizing myself with the character. The game asks the same question that we ask ourselves everyday: Will I make it? Will it be okay? Am I taking the right decision? Is it foolish to chase a dream? We all are afraid if we do not abide by the rules of the society, and work on a course of 'guaranteed future', we could end up wasting our life after a dream that we shall miss in the end. We all are a 'Beth' when a new day begins.  This is a very short game that you should spare the time to take a look at. At the end, I promise you, you'll feel better about whatever your life may hold for you. I know I feel better, and every Beth is a hero.

            "review_text": "Labyrinthine Dreams is a short puzzle game with a story to tell.  What elevates this above a simple grid puzzler is the fact all the puzzles are actually a part of the story: it makes sense for them to be there, and they are not just thrown in to pass time between the short cutscenes. Cutscenes which are done in an anime style with fully voiced dialogue.  Roughly said there are four types of puzzles in this game, all with their unique move sets and rules. Each 'level' is beautifully rendered, and has a score fitting the scene.  The game's soundtrack is simple yet beautiful, and the voiced parts are done by good voice actors.  All the dialog is subtitled as well and the voice can be skipped, not that I felt the need to do so even once.  The big minus point is that this is an RPGMaker game, and therefore suffers from the engine limitations. The game has absolutely no resolution control: you either have to play fullscreen, or in a tiny window, and then use something like Windows' Magnifier to blow up the window. The game can also be very short. Once you learn the trick behind the puzzles you can probably beat it in no time.  The big question then, is it worth €5? My answer is an absolute 'yes'. Even if you manage to beat it in an hour.",

This game has challeging puzzles with different ellements in each one of them which makes each puzzle extremely fun as well as challenging to play through. The game also has a deep story emerged with the puzzles and the art used in the game really adds up to both the story and the game in general. Not to mention the amazing updated graphics, in comparison to the first version, and the beautifully calming and fitting music for this game.  And don't forget the voice acting. The voice acting really adds something special to the game.  All with all it's a must play and more than worth the money.",

Voice acting is better than I expected for a game of this price, and overall it's pretty well put together. If you can pick this up for $1, it's definitely worth it. Hopefully those involved in the creation of the game will continue to improve their skills and put out better and longer offerings in the future,  tl:dr; If you like casual puzzles, can get this for $1, and have an hour to spare.

Now, I would just like to say, that even though I didn't enjoy the game, it was intricate and the story was beautifully done, the voice actors played their parts well and the art is pretty fantastic.  Even though I don't/didn't like it, I am sure there are people that would play it and enjoy it more than I did.",

            "review_text": "Labyrinthine Dreams is truly a game that is well deserving of its “Very Positive”, as of this writing, review rating. The game has a story that a lot of people could relate to in one way or another, with a lot of depth. Don’t believe those saying the game and the story are disconnected, as they’re actually really tightly connected on a very deep level. I can’t get into it more than that without giving too much away, but if you wander around and use (Z Key) the random objects in the very first area it’ll start to paint a picture for you that’s fairly easy to follow.  This game is mostly a puzzle game where you have to plan your movements carefully in order to complete each area. Sometimes you have to outthink the moves of other NPCs. Sometimes you are limited in the directions you can turn. Sometimes the ground even vanishes as you use it, leaving you having to carefully plan your route to the end. Sadly I do have a couple gripes with the game and I’ll go through them one at a time;  First, I found the limitation on video resolutions to be a bit of a letdown. The game is set to a strict resolution (640x480) and that’s the only video mode there is. You can go to a full-screen mode in which the area around the window is just black, or you can stretch it to full-screen which has the effect of seriously degrading the video quality. For those with wide-screens, even the full-screen stretch leaves you with black letterboxing on the left and right. I would have liked to have seen at least a high-resolution mode added for those (like myself) who have resolutions set over 1600x900.  Secondly, I found there were several bugs that heavily affected game play to the point where exiting and reloading the game was the only option. The most notorious bug was the “Additional Keys Disabled” bug which hit me within the first 3 maps. The map was designed so I could only do left-hand turns and walk forward but suddenly (after a map reset) I found myself ONLY able to walk forward. The game had accidentally disabled the left-hand turns in addition to the right-hand turns. I was unable to correct the problem without exiting the game. I also found the “bad guy” would sometimes get stuck and the AI couldn’t figure out how to chase me, which made some maps too easy.  All in all the bugs aren’t really enough for me to not recommend this game. The cost of a few bucks is a fair price and if you can see the link between the story and the puzzles you’ll really enjoy it.",

If anything it'll relate with everyone who buys it regardless of your life it has a atmosphere that makes it automatically sink in depending on how you are. An makes it feel personal. Really good game, again i'd recommend buying it. Though, lol. ;)",
