            "review_text": "slitherine has really outdone themselves this time. I have played many grand strategy games and after a while alot of them seem to slow down to a grind with a rather clear path to victory. This game is slightly different. You may very well be able to win by just holding europe as a whole and posting an army to keep the contenental resistance down. But... you could really use those extra point from completely subjugating spain and Austria's not gonna rule itself (at least not while your tearing it down anyway) and russia sure doesn't seem to long of a walk in the summer, and by the way did we mention your allies the ottomans just ran out of their army fighting russian so the only thing standing between you and india is some *slight* royal navy presence and a few remaining ottomans. Conquering the world (or what matters of it) seems to be a piece of cake. Till everyone else learns how to fight. Then quite a few countries are going to come knocking with new training and equipment and very rudly ask for their stuff back, from you, in person, at paris (and only at paris). So you have to stop the conquest of random Italians and Ottomans to re-finish off the austrians and russians meanwhile the British keep you locked away from your troops in egypt and the spanish seem a bit peeved at your suggestions of 'synergy'. So you wind up trying to keep and empire the size of europe+1 together with shoestrings shot and strategy (and a ton of cursing the british). So in short I love this game. Buy it if you like grand strategy but don't want to know the name of every french sergant involved in the french reconquista.",

            "review_text": "Victory and Glory: Napoleon recounts the Napoleonic Wars using six expeditions that cover the most important events in the career of the great general. The basic expedition begins soon after the coronation of Napoleon as emperor and chronicles his following expedition against the European coalition of England, Austria and Russia with other forces in the continent observing the struggle with a neutral attitude. The secondary expeditions will lead you from the triumph of Marengo up to the Battle of Leipzig, also named Battle of Nations.  The action unfolds in two levels, in the general map where you will receive the most important strategic decisions and in the field of battle. The map reminded me the unforgetable tabletop strategy Risk and includes all the countries and the troops in the simple form of icons. The units can be split up at will and incorporate themselves with other units as well as move independently in different territories in order to confront crises.  Victory and Glory: Napoleon distinguishes itself from the other titles in his category, not because of the amazing graphics or his musical score but for his strategic innovations. Every single minute that you will spend in his company you will feel inside the same sentiments that Napoleon felt in the course of his career: the loneliness of a person who is hated from an entire continent, the stress that rises from repeated crises in your state, you will experience the pride and the arrogance of a conqueror but also the sadness that burdens the breast of the loser after a difficult battle. The highest enjoyment you will feel playing it is no other than the absolute autonomy of strategic movements in his digital world.  The tools of governing in Victory and Glory: Napoleon is the diplomacy, event cards, the deployment of great armies and the armed conflicts. Fluctuating the diplomacy rating with the use of political points that is gathered by your choices is possible to guide the neutral powers at your side. Thus you can turn your newfound allies against the hateful British or improve your relations with the members of the hostile European coalition, isolating your arch nemesis from his allies. The event cards provide many bonuses that should be selected at the appropriate time so that they have also the biggest possible impact in the strategic outcome. If, for example, an army of ten units approaches yours with hostile intent and your army have only five units dont worry. Check the event cards and use (if you have them) those that exchange your units with corresponding superior ones, annex the nation where they standing (if it doesn't belong in your state) and voila, you have neutralized the numerical superiority of the enemies.  In the field of battle, Drover made an amazing work drawing the unit's icons with the quality of a microscopic work of art. With the numerical depiction of experience on units it becomes easy to line them up in strong formations. The strategy in the battle is much deeper than that I have expected before playing the game. The alignment of the military in quartets where the side units enhance the interior ones is a fresh perspective in our digital wars. Placing experienced units in the flanks and weak units on the interior, form an armored legion that withstands everything. The battle mode has nothing to envy from the strategic greatness of a game of chess. How and whether the units will move, where to hit, along with the selection of the target, separates the winner from the loser. The automated processing of battle usually has better results than the manual one but does not offer the same pleasure. You will jumping from joy when you destroy a powerful hostile army cleverly placing your units and killing the enemy units by hitting them in the proper order. The randomness of the attack's outcome favors the continuous loading of your saved positions.  The artificial intelligence of Victory and Glory: Napoleon is so good that it will surprise you. Enemy nations are simply cunning: like a flock of hungry wolves they move carefully in the outskirts of my Empire and gather their forces by choosing the right time to strike. If they have superiority in a field, they attacking mercilessly. For example, in naval battles, i spent many nightmarish moments because the powerful British navy attacked and sank with ease a small number of my fleets. With my navy ravaged, the British temporarily made impossible any possible landing of French troops on their island and also they gain the ability to disembark their troops by sea to every part of the continent they want, remaining a constant threat to my territories.

A major complaint tho, when attacking it seems you can just place a row of 12 Artillery pieces blow theirs up and have them sit on the defensive not willing to walk forward to harm you, essentially granting you free kills.  Enjoyed my time with it might re-visit, too expensive tho, but if you get in the spirit like i did totally worth it, was mad when the game refused to let me go on so reloaded and sabotaged my own playthrough just so i could get to defeat all the powers before having the game declare victory for me.",

            "review_text": "Wargamer? Like playing games that put you in the period? I'd say stay away. Despite initial looks it's risk with cards and very little of any historical accuracy remains after that. Much faux-complexity lurks here, lots of things you'd have to consult the manual to even guess at but it doesn't matter because it's risk with cards and ultimately after a few hours you'd be better off getting out a vassal module and playing something else; in 1805 the Brits landed in Denmark with a huge army despite historically having a tiny army, in 1806 the Spanish attacked the french. Yes really. I turned it off after that.",
