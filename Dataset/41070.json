OOO67VH: kill ♥♥♥♥ =======  Now, the review. ----- 6/10 above average, barely ----- Thank you, Steam Friend, for prompting this review.  This review is for those who don't know Sam and haven't played the other SS games.  Unlike Sanctum2, Borderlands2, Team Fortress 2, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead 2 (differentiated characters co-op), Serious Sam 3 is essentially:  - wildly killing things.  In co-op, add these astonishing features:  - several people running around;  - i think they're killing things too; - dying; - running back to kill more things.  Sure, it's similar to Sanctum 2 or Borderlands 2 in that regard. It's snarky, like BL2. That's always a plus.  But there is a sense of teamwork in other games. Kiting (leading on a baddie to get his back turned to another shooter). Specialization. One-two punches. Syncopating bullet storms.  One, new to co-op, might wander in SS3 to a point where one is both lost and seeing zero baddies, and the game might stay that way for that person for 5 minutes. Lost, with 'fighting sounds somewhere over there'. That's silly.  Here's the rub: there's absolutely zero incentive for others to notice, much less find the team and fight together. In 2013, that's also silly.  Killing Floor/Left 4 Dead 2, OTOH, on Hard, requires that every single member take turns syncopate a bullet storm, have multitasking medics, for the entire team to survive.   Don't get me wrong. I enjoy it, though. SS3 is a fast-paced shoot-everything-that-moves game.   It, like the other SS, has zero active story and purpose. It's like the original DOOM. The goal is to kill ♥♥♥♥ to get to a key, which unlocks a door, so that you can get to kill more ♥♥♥♥.  DOOM reference!  Co-op SS3 means only that more baddies are on-screen and more people are coincidentally playing in the same general map.  I have bought it for a few friends. I did the same with Borderlands 2, Sanctum 2, and Killing Floor. We play the living hell out of those games. We've played SS3 just once, I think.  But I've played it for hours on solo.   It's fun. But it knows its place in gaming. So should you, before you buy it.  Better value than easily half the movies I've ever rented.",

            "review_text": "Here goes my first attempt at a 'serious' review. Serious Sam 3 has great gunplay and customization.  That being said there were several questionable choices made by the developers such as:  -Extremely slow first few levels and super long levels over all: When all you have is the shotgun and imo boring assault rifle the first few levels are really rough, tons of hitscan and lame monsters like the technopolip a person might get the wrong idea about the game in general. Later it's a lot better though. Sad because the other Sams are fun the whole way.  -Enemy trickle effect: Lets slowly let enemies pile into the playing field instead of doing them in nice clear waves so players get bored standing there killing 1-3 at a time. Okay. Yeah this speaks for itself, super annoying. Last level this is SUPER awful and annoying. Artificially extends the game length like a half hour at least.  -Default Performance settings: Are all horrible, to get any kind of FPS out of the game unless your computer is crazy (and mine pretty good) you have to tweak settings a bit. Average Joe gamer is okay with 45 fps but he's usually on a console w/30 fps anyways. This is PC gaming and you should have your midrange presets giving midrange pcs 60+, preferably 100+. But instead its like 5-7 settings that don't get changed that really should so people claim this game has crap performance. Blame the preset options.  -Technopolips: Super annoying to fight and when you only have the rocketlauncher to kill them it's just really all around annoying. They can shoot you thru stuff, kill you really fast and chase you around, all while being immune to small arms and having high hp, and ya know, flying. Slows gameplay to a crawl and makes it annoying and not as fun as it should be.  -Enemies immune to small arms: No place for this in any SS game, terrible design. Makes weapon caches required, bad design.  -Weapon caches: Infinite ammo gets really boring, enemies immune to small arms aren't interesting or fun. Make better more interesting levels please.  -Brides: Slow gameplay down, take control away, pointlessly slow to kill because they gotta pop up a few times and you have to look for them, really annoying.  -Space Monkies: Terrible, I C'4d the ♥♥♥♥ out of those pillars or logged off the game for a while every time i saw these. They hide and attack you around pillars. So there's several places where its just you chasing the stupid monkies around, they aren't really a threat but id rather be mowing down hordes of kamikazes and stuff. Slow gameplay to a crawl as well.  -Dark flashlight sequences where you move slow: Slow gameplay, make the game scary, which i can't stand personally, i dont play SS to be scared but to have fun.  -OP wrist lightning thing: Just really lame overall, looks cool, should be a gun or something.  -OP Devastator: Fun but too much better than the rocket launcher, prefer sniper rifle and grenade launcher instead of weird OP combo gun.  -Sam is _too_ Serious and swears constantly for no reason: SS1 TFE TSE were hilarious. I loved SS2's style even tho most ppl didnt. But SS3 my god man, you don't need random pointless love interest for sam, or him cursing constantly. So weird and out of place from the rest of the games.  -Animations: 3rd person and some others are really bad.  -Egypt: No more god damn egypt lol. Make levels bright and fun like SS2 or TSE.  -Laser gun: NOT ENOUGH OF IT, favorite gun in the series!  That being said many good choices were also made:  -Graphics: Beautiful, awesome looking  -Sounds: Some great sounds (gore/rocketlauncher) Some not so great (assault rifle)  -Gunplay: Overall fun, not as good as SS1 or SS2 as far as i'm concerned however.  -Scrapjacks: Great new monster, pretty fun to fight, i prefer the T-rexes and big red guys from SS2 though.  -Gore: Is great in this game.  -Last boss: These games always have a gimmick at the end, look at quake or nearly any game like this, keeps the hectic tradition alive.  It seems from my review that I might of not liked the game but overall its pretty fun if you like serious sam games and can set it up for decent fps and make it thru the first few painful imo pretty terrible levels.   6.5/10 (+1.5-2)",

            "review_text": "It's funny how this game which was inspired by Duke Nukem in the first place ends up being 100x better than Duke Nukem Forever. If anything, this game should have been the true sequel of Duke Nukem 3D.  Anyway this game is one of the best games in the modern fast paced style first person shooters, and I myself am a huge fan of old school shooters like Doom, Quake 3 Arena and Duke Nukem 3D. In a time when MOBA's, CoD clones and bland mixtures of both, I gotta congratulate CroTeam personally, they made a game that has that old school charm, that old school difficulty, that makes you rage but at the same time the game rewards you for a job well done, something that most modern games threw it away to appeal to a casual audience (well until Doom 2016 came out but that's another review). In other words, this game stands out from all the FPS garbage we have been fed upon ever since the release of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. The replay value is certainly there, the secrets are well hidden. Once again, CroTeam, who were inspired by the fast paced old school shooters, they created a masterpiece.   I do recommend fully that you buy this game if you are into fast paced challenging first person shooters and at the same time tired of the bland modern CoD genre. Seriously, this game is worth every cent.",

Of what the story is for Serious Sam in general, it wasn't fully told, or rather, didn't fully detail what went down in Sam's timeline before stuff went ka-blewy. This game, it fully explains the backstory behind Sam's ventures into the past, and of what leads into Serious Sam 2 of him hopping from planet to planet to finding pieces of Sirian Artifacts.  To share a few gripes about it... it takes itself a bit too seriously. Although it empasizes the old nature of arcade shooters of exploring to find secrets and stuff, about a third of the weapons are found through secrets only. It's a let down, really, unlike the other Serious Sam games, you'd at least get to experience those other weapons once at the very most, or, make use of them quite often.   Though Croteam boasts about the nature of their game, there is much to be seen for improvement. Some effects can get a bit annoying at times, such as the lens flare, making it a tad impossible to see at times. Their animations show their age as well, especially in third person... whoa-hoh-boy... if they didn't take this game too seriously, I'd have laughed along with them in their share of mistakes and blunders.  To the good about it, it does maintain that old arcade shooter feel of collecting armor and health, and of wielding enough fire power that's capable of taking down an entire city. You can freely run amock throughout the levels running and gunning, executing certain enemies, messing around, or enjoying the gauntlets that are provided at times.  If you're a fan of shooters where health doesn't regenerate, and looking to have an enjoyable experience throughout them, this game may as well be for you. It's fun, chaotic, tells a simple story, and best of all, it's Serious Sam.",

The aforementioned outrageous sh!t is all here in Serious Sam 3: BFE.   It's a fine game to rush around and kill anything that walks around and attacks you. For that purpose, wield a 10 round Desert Eagle, a coachgun that can blast most enemies in one hit, a normal assault rifle, or a minigun and turn them into 'Alien hamburger meat'. If a gun doesn't work, then use an ancient bracelet and make enemies explode from the inside-out.   Co-op is satisfying and it was very fun to play with a couple of buddies. Unlike some games, there is a 'compass' in which it will inform you where and how far your pals are. This is very helpful when scouting around for hidden areas or to provide support. Once you experience SS 3 with a trusted friend, you don't ever want to go solo (again).   Serious Sam 3: BFE did have some disappointing qualities. The level design is not impressive (especially for the underground ruins). Newcomers, like me, will have frustrations and tend to run around the map in circles when trying to find something to make progress.   As the game progress, it will then spam large amounts of enemies. To me, this is mostly annoying and repetitive. Sure, you may more targets to eliminate but it quickly becomes unnecessary to endure.   The A.I. has some bugs. A couple of enemies tend to get stuck or have troubles to choosing a target (if there are more than 2 players). Furthermore, their intelligence is mostly predictable and too easily exploited.   The plot is very thin and is forgettable. Unless you're a fan of the series for a long time, it will make you confused. To make matters worse, the dialogue is 'cheesy' and the stale characters are not interesting (well, save for Sam as he's serious enough to be a main character).   Still, if you want a game to play with friends and fight hordes of aliens, then get SS 3 at a discount. $49.99 for the game itself is too much considering my cons.",

The story, as it were, is pretty thin. It's the future. Mankind has gone off into space. Evil aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Earth has been invaded. Humans are screwed. Sam is humanity's last hope. He doesn't give a damn, he's good with a gun, and high explosives are the perfect solution to most of his problems. Most of the dialogue is corny with a side helping of heavy cheese, but there are a few laughs sprinkled throughout. The game isn't afraid to poke fun at genre conventions, and Sam is more or less a self-aggrandizing caricature of the 'buff dumb hero' stereotype.  Most of the enemies are familiar, with headless kamikaze troopers, laser-spewing Biomechanoids and vicious Kleer skeletons returning with their familiar attacks in place. Every enemy has been redesigned to make them look more detestable and even disturbing than ever.  Serious Sam 3: BFE is not a game for the faint of heart. It will challenge your resolve while it constantly pushes you back under a tidal wave of skeletons, fireballs, rockets and chaingun-wielding scorpions. Its levels can last up to an hour, its gameplay never deviates from one note, and it will cause players to thump their desks and roar with rage, but it's so much fun.",

The mechanics are fairly the same as for the others in the official series campaign (excluding the indie games) just run, gun, blow up, and basically 'shoot everything that moves!' Along with the (not entirely rspected) modernized mechanics for sprinting, which is extremely helpful in some cases of survivalbility. Aiming sights, which is kind of dumb having to do that because the original games had their guns automatically pinpoint accurate. And the melee which is a nice touch for me, giving more killing varieties. The levels for this game are MASSIVE and have secrets scattered about everywhere, but I am not going to complain how people think the level designs are 'linear.' Just to note that the classic games had linearity of their own perspective, but not big. The music ambience is really soothing, battle music fits my tastes, and boss music gives a big sense of adrenaline for me. The artstyle for me is decent, I do enjoy its 'semi-realism' approach; but I go for the classic's artstyle which had more cartoonish aspects to it. The weapons are still as devastating as ever. The enemy count is HUGE and there are some new variety of enemies now, though not much more, but some. The DLC (Jewel of the Nile) topped the icing, bringing what fans more wanted. My overall verdict: Buy it!",

So, what makes Serious Sam 3 stand out from the rest?   Well, here are a few reasons: This game is perfect for playing with a friend. The whole game of Serious Sam revolves around you plaing in huge, open-ended enviornments, mowing down wave after wave of literally hundreds of enemies. Playing by yourself is intense, challenging, and down-right panic enducing. With a friend, the intensity is doubled, and the fun factor just shoots through the roof. Trying to separate the waves of enemies into two different targets is really challenging, and it feels even more satisfying when you've got a buddy.   The game's also down-right hilarious. The developers and writers knew what kind of game they were making, and they don't take themselves seriously at all. The game rags on itself, common action movie tropes, practically anything related to action movies in general.   The weapons are just straight-up badass. They even have a double-barreled shotgun (DooM's famous 'Super Shotgun') that feels just like the classic iteration. Some of the weapons are down-right wacky - like the canonball launcher, which literally flattens hundreds of enemies at a time. The gunplay feels solid, and you feel like you can dole out some serious damage-- a thing that's lacking from a lot of modern-day FPS.   The amount of customization in the PC version is stellar, too. You can honestly get lost in the graphics settings menu. Seriously, more PC games need to take a hint from Croteam and allow this lush, rich level of customization options.  I love classic First Person Shooters quite a bit, and I guess that's why I'm even more happy with this product. I'll be putting tons of hours into it before DooM comes out. I also highly recommend you check out the other games listed at the top of my review, but pick this one up first and go blow up some monsters.  ",

            "review_text": "Let me preface this by saying only one thing: If you are used to easy games, then stay very far away. VERY far away.   With that being said...  Serious Sam 3: BFE is set a little bit before the original in the series, and has some different mechanics from the pure run'n gun originals that preceed it. Tweaks such as a dedicated sprint button, and *gasp* reloading. But the core mechanics are still the same as they always were: Kill anything that moves.   The story of the game is quite a bit below average, aping the Call of Duty series thinly in the cutscenes with a touch of 'serious' humor to go along with it, but for the most part, it can be ignored almost entirely, as it doesn't really add much to the overall mythos of the series. Wait.. did I just seriously say that? Though I will admit that the cutscenes involoving the reveal of bosses and such are extremely well done, and of course, the voice acting is... 'serious.'  Graphics of the game are a treat to behold in all their glory, especially on decent systems, and despite the sheer number of enemies you face at one time, there isn't usually much slowdown to be had here. The art style has shifted to a more realistic approach, unlike earlier games in the series, which used a somewhat toned down cartoony approach to the visuals. Not an unpleasant look overall, but it might infuriate the fans of the older games.  At the heart of it all, it's a run-n-gun shooter, much in the line of the legendary Quake and Doom, only amped up to the 'nth degree with literally thousands of enemies to shoot. Thanks to that, the game becomes brutally difficult, mainly due to the sheer numbers of enemies that you have to deal with at any one time. I've seen as many as 100 enemies coming at me at the same time.   Are the enemies intelligent? No, thankfully. Because if they were, it would be truly impossible to beat them. Instead, they run straight for you, for the most part. Granted, there are some that have a bit of variety in their attack patterns, forcing you to shift your strategy mid-battle on a regular basis, but overall, they just have one thing to do: kill you.   However, due to the variety of enemies, and the differing requirements to kill them, it NEVER gets boring. This is one of those games that every weapon is good for something, even the lowly sledgehammer gets some use, even in late game. Learning what works best for each situation becomes a part of your strategy, as each weapon has unique qualities and uses.  Is this game 'serious' enough to stand on the giants shoulders of the genre? Close. The brutal difficulty is the main thing that stands in the way of it being considered, in my opinion, the best of the series.   One other thing...it has a serious sense of humor.   Seriously.",

I've been a huge fan of Serious Sam games for a long time, and have played First and Second Encounters to death (can't say the same about SS 2, but I'll tend to that in the nearest future). So far I have completed about half of the game, and I really like it. The first few levels were quite slow paced and felt a bit different from previous Serious Sam installments, but eventually the pace picks up and it plays just like the classics. The tone of the game is more serious, with more realistic weapon and enemy models, but it's not a bad thing. Overall, Serious Sam 3 is a worth a play for an ordinary FPS fan, and a must buy for seasoned Serious Sam players.",

The campaign is generic and outright boring but the combat is o so addicting with weapons offering crisp sounds and impacts into the target and once you get that sledgehammer and take your first wack at an enemy they explode into gibs which is hilarious in its own sick sense. And as i've said before the devs are really keen on making this game which is what really saves this game and gives it the charm that valve games get from most. I'm hoping this game gets better with every update. If you're a fan of classic doom and the original serious sams this game will deliver and keep you going for a while, however the game is extremely easy (i'm on a normal playthrough and have encountered no changes thus far) so if you play shooters in general try the serious mode.

Although the game mixes both baked and realtime lighting, the performance cost for running realtime lighting and shadows is staggering. The Serious engine will no longer be known for performing well - it stutters and has inconsistent performance.  The maps are 30% bad, 70% good. The beginning of the campaign is almost a mockery of modern shooters with its tight corridor design and linear progression. Thankfully, soon into the game the levels open up as is customary for a Sam game.  The weapons and enemies deserve no special comment.

TRIGGER WARNING: Features ♥♥♥♥ and a good, albeit sexist and misignist soundtrack.",

With a massive arsenal of weapons to choose from and being able to hold all of them at once, it's refreshing to see this type of game series is still alive and even has a fourth edition in the series on it's way.

            "review_text": "Serious Sam 3: BFE, what a great series to see make a come back. Mental is once again assaulting Earth and it is up to Sam to save the inhabitants through his various, unorthadoxed ways. More wacky, creative, and outrageous enemies to fight and more amazing, cinematic, and over the top battles with crazy amounts of enemies!  That being said:  I absolutely adore Serious Sam, these games have managed to stay on top of the graphical benchmarks in each installment making their beautifully designed levels stand out greatly. On top of the amazing visuals the game has a unique gameplay style where rather have you focus on cover, you focus on movement and dodging the onslaught of enemies that seem to endlessly rush your position.  There have been many spin offs of this series as the developer encourages people to experiment with the insane universe of Serious Sam, but I only recommend the cannon games.  Serious Sam 3 itself, is a very nice game, taking a slightly different spin on the series and adding in mechanics such as hand to hand combat and more realistic environments. For some reason, as someone who grew with Serious Sam, this game doesn't strike me exactly like the others. Granted the 'second' game was cartooney and not even close to what I expected from the series, this one is... off.  I enjoy it and do plan to finish it sometime and I would totally recommend it as a 40 and under game. The environments, weapons, enemies, and just about anything else you can think of are all nicely detailed as you would expect from the game. The developers take the Serious Sam universe very seriously in the sense that they take the time to fill in back story and give each item and character a back story. Eventhough you are killing enemies by the hundreds and will never care to know why they even want to tear the flesh from your bones it's nice to slow down the pace from time to time and hop into the menu that gives you details on everything you could possibly need to know while also giving you a nice detailed 3D model of your subject.  Now onto gameplay, this series is known for its amazingly large battles where enemies are sent to you in masses and you have to systematically remove them from existance. The games usually feature limited cover, large amounts of ammo and nearly no reloading. This keeps combat fast paced and interesting as you are no longer worried about reloading at the best opprotunity but more so, dodging the Werebull charging at you or the rockets hurling at your back. I think this is part of the reason the game gives me so much trouble. It seems in some parts of the game, you are actually given cover in dense urban environments, which isn't unheard of in serious sam but it is definitely not common. The weapons also seem to have been revamped for more of a call of duty-ish feeling than a serious sam feeling. I have yet to beat the game but I don't think this is too much of a problem. There is also this new leash sort of weapon, which only reminds me of the leash in Bulletstorm. I have yet to use this mechanic to its full potential but I hear it is fun to use. Aside from that the game hasn't changed too much and I still recommend it as much as I recommend every other Serious Sam. I'm seriously serious here, you need all of these games at some point in your life.",

Through towns, to tombs, and plenty of places with nice vistas, the game looks quite good. While every level throws hordes of enemies at you, the action never felt overly repetitive. Some of the most memorable moments come from when the odds become absolutely absurd, such as fighting the Alcor Class Warship in The Power of the Underworld level. Entering an area with quite a few structures about, and leaving with none of them left standing definitely brings a smile to one's face.   While Sam has no witty and deep dialog, some of his gruff one liners are rather comical and they fit in perfectly well. Some of the battle music tends to get repetitive, and some of the best music is played during down time (meaning not very often). Outside of that one small inconsequential complaint, the gameplay mechanics are solid, making Serious Sam 3 a great buy and highly enjoyable game.",

Story based FPS games like Half-Life or open-world FPS-RPGs like the Elder Scrolls or Deus Ex series gave me more fun and variety. I dropped the pure FPS games for a long time.  Serious Sam takes the old shooter route: there is no fight realism and tactics are just on a molecular level due to the speedy gameplay but hey where else can you kill single-hadedly half the hostile galaxy in a single gameplay now'days? As the game story grows so do the number and size of your opponents. It becomes vast. The protagonist is on the level of the king of macho alien poppers, Duke Nukem. As a game, it does everything right that Duke4ever failed to deliver (at least to me, maybe I suspected too much). If you played the ancient predecessors of the genre you will find a lot of funny but respectful references to the pioneers of FPS while Sam is doing its own take on it.  If you seek for depth and like to stop and plan your actions, this is not for you. But if you like bold, raw, in-your-face games and you are into larger-than-life, over-the-top gaming experence that you play by instinct, give it a try and kick some serious major ♥♥♥.",

The co-op mode immediately offsets this with silliness, as you are accompanied by as many as 15 compatriots, each wearing a skin of their choice We played with a team of Sam, an enormous black man wearing a revealing pink frock, and Croteam's CFO.   The first few levels don't do the game justice - but it's not long until you are elbow deep in wide open areas, surrounded by waves of diverse and enormous foes, smashing into them with a sledgehammer and sticks of throwing dynamite just for the mad glee of it.",

The game is just pure tan/brown/yellow and the only time you see a different color is on the enemies or when you go to activate one of the generators that power the time gate. the color scheme needed to be worked on and i hope that if another game is in the works that it takes on the colorful nature of the second encounter.   the game has online capabilities but they are completely empty as no one really buys these games for the vs aspect of it at all; instead we have everyone playing the singlplayer or the co-op modes that the game comes with.

Serious Sam 3 is sort of a hybrid combination of modern day FPS and the old style wave FPS. My first impressions of Serious Sam 3 were very skeptical. The glowing items and overall Call Of Duty feel almost convinced me to bail after the first two stages. The game felt unfinished like some sort of abandoned military game snatched up and modified with the Serious Sam name. I want to be clear that while there could be a lot of improvements and it's certainly not like the originals I am glad that I kept playing.  The graphics in this game are more realistic than the originals and they are pretty impressive. I like the original art style but SS3 will give you a break from that entirely. The sounds are pretty good but very repetitive and while I like the music I did eventually mute it at certain points because there just wasn't enough variation. The controls for the most part are similair to the originals which is convenient because you can double press a bind to find the secondary weapon if you don't already have a unique bind set. There is a sprint key that will completely change how the game feels if you never use it the entire campaign. I played almost to the last stage without sprint because I didn't know it was there and without it encounters are more horrifying.  How does the progression feel? There are situations/areas that are constantly bombarded with opposition like the original games but it doesn't flow like first and second encounter. Expect to see some of the same enemies and a few new ones as well. There are many areas, mainly interior structures, that take on a Resident Evil type vibe which I didn't expect having played the originals. Despite the deviation from the original format the environments and ambience in some locations really impressed me. *spoiler* I found exploring the pyramids was extremely creepy and at times outright horrifying. If there were more spawns inside the interiors and if the layout was more complex like the originals the game would have been ten times better. It's one of my main complaints about SS3 that the interior encounters felt unfinished or nearly non-existent. The outdoor environments were reasonable but giving the player a temporary deployable lighting effect and finishing the underground even as DLC would have improved SS3 drastically. You could potentially justify the slowplay elements if this was done.  Overall where my expectations with SS3 dropped off initially they picked back up considerably after I gave it a chance and progressed through the game. I can't say it can compare to the originals because the format is not the same at all but I enjoyed it for what it was. *spoiler* some of the boss fights are pretty epic and the space ship appearing blew me away.",

(i hate games that give me loads of guns and then i end up just using one of them) -Ammo and health drops are plentiful but not coddling (at least on normal) -Varied gameplay, from urban mazes to good ol' open fields to circle strafe around  -Fun boss battles -effective if generic soundtrack -It runs on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ macbook and still looks decent -great effects and lighting (from what i can tell lmao)  cons  -it doesnt have much in the way of 'immersive storytelling' lel -some of the sound design is meh -the humor is hit or miss -some of the gun animations are a bit meh as well  aside from some nitpicks, this is a great game.  9/10 would AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA again     ",

Details: The beginning of the game isn't very 'exciting', but when the action starts it's very fun. The classic use of 'Boss' levels and such is very nice and adds some nostalgic values to the game. The game runs good, however sometimes FPS drops to 40FPS even on a powerful computer (6 cores + GTX 970). The game has some really nice action moments, it also has some horror moments (at least for me it was), Big maps and fun to use weapons, good graphics generally (even for 2011 game, the game looks OK today). Sometimes the game is very frastrating and hard (epsecially the ending! very hard!)  In conclusion:  Pros: - It's actually relaxing to shoot at hords of aliens (weird aliens), many times the game has really intense action moments which are REALLY REALLY fun. - The game has some humor in it. - Maps are big, their design is OK. - The game has a unique setting which I like.  Cons: - Dead online community (you have nobody to play with online). - Can be really annoying at times, you have to do the same thing over and over until you succeed. - Music is repetitive (soundtracks are not long enough in my option), and after spending some time in the same map, it starts to annoy. - The last section of the game is VERY VERY hard and can be really annoying sometimes.",

The final boss was also seriously lame, and it was hard to tell whether they were trying to make fun of SERIOUS MODERN SHOOTER plotlines or actually thought they were writing a good one. Serious Sam 1 and 2 are going to remain my favourites of the series, but the middle of Serious Sam 3 is pretty good.  The start suffers from just a serious lack of fun weapons, and the end just has... too many interminable waves of enemies.

Before starting the REAL review, I play in 'Serious' difficulty and I've played all the previous Serious Sam.   At the beggining the game was really fun and you had to use your brain sometimes (I said sometimes, you can still maintain left click and kill everything), but the more I play, the more I have to force myself ... I'm a little bittle after the middle of the game and I don't enjoy shooting at alien's face anymore. It's just ennemy waves after ennemy waves and you just keep dying and dying.  So, I'll end this little review by giving goods parts and bad parts   GOOD : Fun at the beggining, a good variety of monster and a lot of weapons. Good bossfights and a wonderfull story (I'm not trolling Kappa).   BAD : After 11-12h into the game, you'll do over and over the same kind of event which is just killing HUGE ennemy waves (it can be good, but over and over, you just feel annoyed). And in 'Serious' difficulty, you really had to count every bullet that you shoot else you'll have trouble",

            "review_text": "Sure, the graphics are prettier, but this installment lacks the zaniness and epic scale of the previous games.  In my mind, Serious Sam games are about letting loose hoards of enemies in a field, piling the player with sweet guns, and having them cleave a bloody path to victory with some liberal circle-strafing and smart ammo management. Also lots of cool secrets. BFE has surprisingly little of all that.  What this game has lots of is: 1. Fighting small groups of powerful enemies in tight spaces 2. Long stretches without powerups - demanding harsh conservation of health and ammo 3. Boringly gritty, realistic desert scenes copy-pasted ad nauseam 4. Slow, steady streams of Kleer skeletons  I'd like to focus on #4 for a moment. If you are familiar with Serious Sam games, you know that Kleer are extremely dangerous if they get the drop on you or surround you, but in a pack in the open they can be easily dealt with with some clever strafing and a good rapid-fire weapon. Some sadistic game designer at Croteam seems to have figured out the best way to get the worst of both worlds: the slow, steady stream of Kleers. The slow stream means that you only ever face one at a time - making rapid fire weapons impractical (especially with the harsh ammo distribution I mentioned in #2). That means you need to use the shotgun: a matter of extreme nuance. Fire too early and the Kleer is merely wounded and just as deadly as ever, too late and you risk the massive damage they deal. No, you must fire at it mid-leap while dodging out of the way. If you miss or fire too early, the Kleer ends up behind you. But there's no time to face it again because the next Kleer in the stream is already on its way, but now the timing and dodging is harder because you have to keep in mind the one behind you. Miss the second Kleer and the third is harder still, and so on. The most viable strategy is a sequence of perfectly timed dodges and shotgun blasts; and BFE has you perform this punishing ritual for minutes on end many times throughout the game.  As for #3, BFE has essentially 3 environments: outdoor ancient ruins, indoor ancient ruins, outdoor modern ruins. It gets stale fast. There is one brief and wonderful change of scenery late in the game but it amounts to little more than a cutscene. The first game did a much better job of providing variety while keeping with the desert them. Speaking of custscenes, BFE's attempt at a narrative is terrible. If it were a little worse it could have perhaps been laughably terrible, but instead it's just 'Dear God I hope they realize how bad this is.' terrible.  The lack of powerups is a real shame. The game has a few cool weapons but I spent almost the whole game without any ammo for them. I think got to use the laser gun... twice?  There are some good moments. The final level and boss are pretty cool, I just don't think it's worth suffering through the rest of the game to get there.",

The games always had a very specific charm to them; there's something mesmerizing about slaughtering dozens of colorful enemies with dozens of colorful guns for hours on end. The First and Second Encounter were hours of fun, amazing in multiplayer, whether it was playing through the campaign or on PVP servers.  Serious Sam 3 displays these traits in tiny, sorrowful streaks of what little SS identity it pathetically tries to preserve. This game is torn between being a Serious Sam game, and being a modern shooter that will appeal to the masses, ultimately failing to truly satisfy either.   The game is devoid of the signature silliness of your standard SS game; the WHOLE game is set in a washed out desert/city environment with little to no variation. The weapons you get are very similar to one another, and the game forces you to use the ones that are the least fun to use (Assault Rifle, i'm looking at you).  The game breaks the legs of its own pacing every time it makes a step. An hour of mindless shooting at the same colorless enemies with the same boring weapons gets interrupted by horrible tomb-crawling sequences, where you are supposed to blindly navigate awfully laid-out underground mazes pressing switches that blend with the walls to open completely random passages in another section of the tomb.  Even the microgameplay is severely flawed: most weapons have a rather boring feel to them, feeling like a chore to use (again, Assault Rifle), and even the signature Minigun has a pathetic sound that leaves a sour taste in one's mouth. A monstrously bad decision was to make some guns have a reload mechanic which straight-up ruins any sort of attempted flow, as you awkwardly backpedal while headless kamikaze run you down. The weapons also feel severely underpowered: both shotguns have horrible firerate coupled with pathetic damage at any range larger than 10 feet, the assault rifle feels like it's spraying popcorn instead of bullets, and the only truly powerful weapons you get (Devastator and the cannon) are starved of ammo throughout the game, making them unusable on any but the largest enemies.  80% of all the enemies you face are the same enemies you fought in other Serious Sam games (the headless shooters and kamikaze make for probably 70% of the kill count), while the only enemy that is truly new is also the worst of all you face: a floating sorceress that blinks around, turns invulnerable, and whenever she gets a line of sight on you, lifts you into the air and screws up your turn rate so you can't even fight back as you take damage.  As a Serious Sam fan, this game is an abomination and an insult to the name. As a gaming fan, this is a shallow, washed out FPS with corny attempts at humor, frustrating mechanics, basic game feel and a disappointing experience overall.  4/10",

I like mindlessly shooting mobs as much as anyone, but here it's too much. I did enjoy playing it somewhat, but I can't reccomend it as to be honest there are much better ways you can spend money on steam.  So lets start with whats good. The co-op is pretty fun, if you can find a server that is. But it's not perfect, for example it's quite easy for everyone to get separated because of the large and sometimes confusing maps (especially in the dark). But for the most part it's a good time teaming up with people to face to onslaught. Other than this, the enemies are initially quite fun to fight, and the high intensity of it all is good fun.  Now lets move onto whats bad. The map designs are pretty repetitive. The early maps quite bad as well, they feel largely empty and there is far too little variety in colour. Later on it's just nondescript egyptian temple style structures. So it's either desert colour or grey colour. I suppose you could say that the large and empty map design is so that you can have a huge arena to fight all the enemies in. This works to a degree, but there's far too much of the same thing. After a few hours you will get bored of constantly clicking killing wave after wave of enemy.  So in short, I can't reccomend it because it's too monotonous in the long run.",

Once you pick up the double shotgun things get more fun for a while, but the overall level design just doesn't feel suited to this sort of game - there are too many places for enemies to get stuck and the sounds they make are misleading: they sound a lot closer than they usually are.  The last level goes on for far too long, and the final boss is a bit of an odd fight.  The graphics are fairly pretty, but the dust and smoke (although pretty) from the suicide bombers means that you're often unable to see most of the onrushing enemies.
