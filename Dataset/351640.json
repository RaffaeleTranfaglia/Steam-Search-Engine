I don't usally play RPG games at all, but this game.. was a exception  Good: The Story is rich and full of meaning, your always finding out more things about the characters and backstory throughout the game It's easy to learn it may only have 4-5 MAIN levels but they are VERY VERY! well done and good hidden secrets. For a small RPG game, it has aout 5-6 hrs of gametime and i didnt even collect all the sercets! I'm not gonna ruin the game but the endings..actually made me cry alot.. they ARE moving The Art in this game for the endings and other parts are high detail and truely amazing. A Ton more!  Cons: I only have one.. PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE  Overall 10/10 on the Wolf Scale It is rather sweet and careful constructed story and this game really deserves alot of praise. I will be playing this game again.. I can't get enough of it!",

Eternal Senia is an RPG Maker style game with unique battle system but simple with a story about swordman girl Senia who find her lost sister a priest Magaleta in to the 'Tower of Eternity'.  Tower of Eternity, a mysterious dungeon with a powerful power call 'Eternity' that can grant a wish if someone receive and grant control it, many have tried but all failed and never come back. Why Magaleta seek for a such power?   Ok, enough with the story. let's start with Cons.   Cons - Not long enough, about 6-7 Hrs with some grind. - Translation isn't perfect, there are a lot of an awkward grammar once a while through the game, need to improve for more experience with story. - Can make you cry.   Pros - Great battle system but simple unique and cool, an ARPG style without fightscene and not like a cheap RPG Maker game you can find on internet. You'll find yourself addict to it. - Deep story and great development of story line that make you forget the time. - OST is great especially piano, love it! - Interesting Characters. - Crafting system is simple and easy to grind but effective. - Multiple difficulty on boss fight, hardmode is fun and challenge just take your time read the mechanic and you'll be fine. (Not effect the story) - Can change resolution with less quality lost.(F6) - Some Ragnarok reference make you feel nostalgic - Multiple ending. - FREE!  There's no reason not to try this game.  10/10 would keep on finding again.",

            "review_text": "Eternal Senia takes you on an epic journey through the eyes of a young girl named Senia. Although simple in presentation, this game exemplifies how the ARPG genre should be through innovative changes to classic mechanics and a strong focus on story and ambiance.   The graphical style and user input are sure to inspire feelings of nostalgia for gamers over 30. A throw back to a time when fundamental game play mattered more than death counters or clicks per second, Eternal Senia is a fresh new experience that anyone looking for a little bit of relaxing fun at any age should be able to pick up and enjoy.   This game has:     immersive atmospheric effects and high quality background music     replayability due to sections of randomly generated content and multiple endings     side quests for collectables and optional boss monsters  Game developer and publisher Holy Priest has delivered a gift in the form of Eternal Senia, completely free of charge, back to the game-playing community that embraced him many years ago within Ragnarok Online. I have no doubt that others who take the time to experience this labor of love will be similarly motivated by his inspirational work.  In the end, the game is shorter than I would like. I also would have preferred more graphics options including native support for 16:9 displays and the ability to play in a windowed fullscreen mode, however these are minor technical points compared to the positive aspects of the game. For what is essentially a hobbyist project, Eternal Senia is an unqualified success worth taking note of.  9/10",

The simple game mechanics are simple, and easy to understand. The game even rewards the player for exploring and grinding for enemies for loot and equipment, good for the people who search in EVERY CORNER.       The boss battles were kinda hard, although all i played though were the hard mode bosses, so even with the best equipment, they still hurt. Kinda makes for a great challenge if you can beat the game and hard mode bosses with terrible gear. So if you play through the game and gather the best equipment available for that stage, and find the boss to easy, swich it up to hard mode, or remove some equipment for a challenge, although it does not affect the endings of the game (If you end up going crazy because you cant beat the bosses on hard mode, its just to have the battle harder, it doesnt affect the game anymore then that.)",

Like the 16-bit graphics and anime-styled artwork, the sounds and music of this game help add to that classic RPG feeling. None of these things will leave a big impression on you, but they are good for a game like this. The controls are simple. There is also the option to play in either full-screen or window mode.   The Good: + Good graphics and sound for a 16-bit game + Low CPU usage - runs smoothly on most all systems + Full Controller Support  The Bad: - With tons of dialogue, an auto-scroll timer would be a welcome addition   True RPG fans will want to add this game to their libraries.",

            "review_text": "This game is really lovely and well made. Would give 9/10  Story:  It starts when a young swordswoman called Senia tries to find her High Priestess Sister Magaleta, which vanished into the Tower of Eternity. Following her, you get to know more about the sad background story and emotional relationship between those two.  Gameplay:  This game is doable included all endings and doing all sidequest in about 4-5 hours. It's short but still a lot of fun and once you are into it, you don't really want to stop playing it. As you can see it's an ARPG, so you are basically only playing one character with some skills equipped. A good thing is that you can grind ingredients and craft your own equipment in the game.  Difficulty:  To be honest killing the small mob is really easy it's like u get 0 damage from the mini monsters, only the boss fights are challenging and only on Hard Mode anyway.  Characters:  Really well done, I like the art design and also the personalities of all characters. (might be that I known them from Ragnarok Online, which was my favourite MMO 7 years along)  Music: Not many different tracks, however some of them are tearjerkers and very emotional, which totally fits perfectly at specific scenes.  It's not the best game I've played, but a real good one.  I'd definitely redcommend it. ",

Not great, but good. Definetly had me engaged, desperate to see the final outcome. It took me a while to get all three endings but the good news is you don't have to play through the entire game again just to see a different ending. Characters are an important part of any good story and Eternal Senia has some ok characters. You get a decent idea of Senia and Magaleta's personalitys and their backstories which really helped add extra emotional impact to the endings (There are three endings and all of them are real tear jerkers). That being said, they didn't feel quiet as fleshed out as they could have been.  Gameplay in Eternal Senia is really good. Combat is quiet a bit different from the usual RPG affair with no turn based combat or anything like that. Instead you simply run into enemies to attack them and use Q, W, E and R to use special attacks. It's a simple system that works very well with the game. The graphics are also nice and I really liked the artstyle. The music was also really great. Not much else to really say there. Um. Yeah. So it's pretty great. And free. Not flawless though, it's a tad repetitive right at the end and the final boss fight was a bit unfair, it's still a good game.   +Reasonable characters +Decent story +Very nice visuals +Great music +Simple yet good gameplay  -Characters could have been a little more fleshed out -A tiny bit repetitive towards the end -Could have done with at least one happy ending  70/100 - 'Just a lil' bit 2 sad'   Sequel please?

A remarkable journey where the sister ventures into danger to find the only family she has left, her sister and will risk anything no matter how small the chances are, to be with her and to back to the Church together. Throughout the Journey Senia is more and more emotional yet never gives up. Determination at it's finest. 10/10  Gameplay: Simplistic and yet fun. Maybe not the best combat system but it's still one fun game to play. The Game developer didn't try to win us over with the gameplay regardless. We're in it for the story. Even thuogh so the traps, monsters and obstacles to push are fun and joyable in it's own right. 9/10  Grahpics/Visuals: I can tell they worked hard on it. The characters look absolutely stunning. They display the correct emotions at the correct time. The visuals also impact how we,the player feel about thie story and we feel more emerged into the story, Feeling Senia's pain. 9/10  Music(OST): I'll be honest here and say this game's OSTs are some of the best OST's I've ever heard. Especially the menu music. QUite addicting, it's like a mix of rap and hiphop. Anyway the game developers did a good job designing the music. It fits well into the game and they put it in the right times for a better emotional attachment to both the character and the story. 10/10  Overall Rating for Eternal Senia: 9.5/10. It's without a doubt my top RPG at the moment and I hope they'll make a sequel. This game must be explored by other gamers out there who's not looking for anything super fancy, but a nice little RPG that can take your heart away.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  All credit to Mr Pie. Youll find him on my friends list somewhere  oh yeah ive totally just played this game for 5 minutes but it did the anime dash cutty thingy where they dash and then the enemy dies behind them and Senia will never be Roranoa Zoro but i wont ruin her dreams. and my mum just gave me a toasted bacon and egg sandwhich. oh yeah. im gonna enjoy this. have fun with the pie and remember dont forget to scorn the guy who came up with the condom tutorial  oh wait  thats me  bye",

It puts you more in the action during battles and makes for different levels of play. If you are having a hard time during a boss battle and can't get passed it, just put it on easy mode. Most of the battles are decently challenging on the normal difficulty, but there is a big difficulty curve for the end boss fight.  The story is amazing.

This is a totally free game, so unless you hate video games you probably should give it a quick download and at least check it out.  Now that that's out of the way.. yes, indeed, it's an RPGmaker game-- but don't let that turn you away. Sure, it's got RPGmaker assets for most the backgrounds/terrain and some of the enemies, but;   - It's got fully custom character art for the main characters, with many different states as well as gorgeous full-screen art for many cutscenes;  - It's got REALLY nice custom music with only, like, 2 of the 20 or so songs in the game being anything approaching repetitive or grating, and several tracks being downright excellent;  - It's got a simple but beautiful and bittersweet story, especially once you get to the end;  - And best of all, it's got a hand-crafted action-RPG battle system reminiscent of the original Ys games and other oldschool RPGs instead of your regular random-battles-turn-based RPGmaker faire.  My only real complaint would be its length; as a free game made almost entirely by one guy, I wasn't expecting too much, but this lovely game is simply over far too quickly. Even if you're the type like me that's going to go way out of your way to do absolutely every single optional thing possible and grind every item, you're still looking at a single afternoon's work all told. The good news is the guy's apparently already hard at work on a sequel.  So yes, get this game, download it, play it, fill out the post-game survey, let the creator know he's a rad dude, and have a great time. Sure, the gameplay's quite simple overall, it's not very long, and there are some generic graphical assets you MIGHT notice in between the gorgeous manga-style character art, but I can think of little excuse for anyone not to give this game a play.",

The game is so simple and straightforward, heck, there are puzzles where hints are discreetly hiding right in front of your face to which I find quite enjoyable for an ARPG~  Visual design and Music I must say that I'll give the developer a double thumbs up if he drew all of these by himself! If he only had more time and people to help him, this game could have been more for an SNES-like game. As for the music, I am hearing a lot of familiar BGMs and OSTs from anime, it must've been remixed version? Correct me if I'm wrong but one of the bgms in the game is strikingly similar to one of Clannad's BGM but overall, each of them perfectly fits to where they are placed.  Do I recommend the game? If you're a Ragnarok Online player,  YES  due to an ample amount of reasons. What if you're not? I still recommend it trying, first of all, it's FREE. A game which you could play for approximately 5 hours and has 3 endings for you to unlock if the game managed to reel you in.  A truly enjoyable game~    FUN TRIVIA   ALRIGHTY! As the developer says front-hand without sugar coating it whatelse, etc etc. This game is inspired by one of the best MMORPG back in the old days called Ragnarok Online which is also based from the manwha of the same name by Lee Myung jin.   History, comparison and differences;   The developer also stated that Egnigem Cenia or Ygnizem Seniar from RO (or whatever her name is on your preferred language) and Senia of the game  are identical to both name and appearance only  as the Egnigem Cenia from RO met far worst/cruel/fatal fate than our Senia here which RO players must not link it from the original in any of sort.  Before I continue, I've only seen the 2nd ending of this game. I don't have the time to play it again #, also completed it at hard mode lvl 34, all unlockables, get!    A fate worst than death;    Egnigem Cenia   She is the boss of Biolab 2nd floor and is revealed and confirmed to be Seyren Windsor's little sister; their father resisted the human experimentation thus as a punishment, the Rekenber Corporation experimented on them as per shown in Biolab questline. After she and countless others died due to an explosion where the corporation attempted to do its final experimentations whereas they resisted to give in which made the containment area to overload. Their spirits materialized into the present world ever haunting the place to which whomever tries to stumble upon the dreadful place will meet their demise.   Ygnizem Senia   The only survivor from a monster invasion occured on her village which later then she was saved by the Archbishop Malgaleta. Ventured through the Tower of Eternity to look for the person whom she cherishes the most only to find that 'Eternity' has already taken control of the said person. Our heroine has the capability of containing Eternity within herself which we don't know if has fatal side effects but as shown in the game, it's more like she becomes the vessel once she absorbs Eternity and so indeed what happened. Our heroine, Senia, mercilessly slashed Malgaleta to death whilst trying her best to save her but it was all for naught. At the end, both of them perished, Senia, wasn't able to contain Eternity vanishes? along with them giving the game a bittersweet ending.   NOW THEN, isn't that quite a fun trivia?",

The puzzles are very well made and the crafting element of the game is well made enough that I put a fair amount of time backtracking the dungeons farming for items and find hidden treasure chests. The combat system is simple and easy outside of storyline and boss battles (and once you become accustomed to skills and crafting it's a breeze).   My only dislikes is the story telling but it's a pretty standard synopsis (no spoilers).  It's quite easy to log 4+ hours in this game just by the secret puzzles and weapon crafting. Great for any RPG lover (especially if you like trying to get 100% completion in a game).  I rate this game 4.5 / 5.",

An interesting, yet incomprehensible game with characters and plot that feel like they were cut out from cardboard, game design more backhanded than a Rakshasa and all put to the most baffling musical scoring I have ever encountered.  The game's writing is full of contrivances, grammatical errors and scenes that are either unneccessary or perhaps just a little bit too long.   I remember a key instance where an elf showed up in my path, armed with a bow and arrow. Immediately I saw that the bridge I was stood on was wide enough to sidestep their attack, and that they had a missile nocked and ready to fire, but the game decided that Senia hadn't fulfilled her moping quota yet and needed to strain out a tutorial disguised as poor character development, instead of me just knocking the forest dweller onto his silken britches.  The gameplay is fundementally flawed, if at times entirely broken. The key to interaction here seems to be a unique, action-oriented combat system in which mobile foes wander around aimlessly on a grid, until you walk up to them in order to initiate an auto-attack, slicing them to peices with your sword. However, attacking has a high chance to knock you back one space (Though not into hazards like trips and traps, because that would be engaging), and very quickly it devolves into 'Butt Heads with Creepy Mc. Crawly #394 encounting'.  Bosses tend to shake things up a bit more than regular grunts, with actual attack patterns that force you to move around the arena instead of just bumping into them repeatedly, but they're all far too easy and exploitable to see the full potential of this system. The first boss in particular, was a dragon with a mighty breath weapon... and an arthritic neck. I slew him easily by moving up to his left flank and carving it into wyrm-burgers.  There are also puzzles - which are nearly all beatable from brute force - traps that pose little to no threat when your Hit Points regenerates faster than lightning and a crafting system that aims to releive frustration, but this is mitigated by the overly fast pace and the fact that a girl I found in a magical forest, deep within a ethereal kingdom of swords and sorcery knows what 'Facebook' is.",

The main reason I give it a thumbs down is due to the lack of polish in the user interface. You start the game and there is nothing telling you what keys to use to move or even how to accept or cancel. It's very ackward for the first few minutes. There is also a bug where two types of gems show up with the same name and you are left wondering why you can't build certain items eventhough the gem is in your inventory. Some of the boss enemies sit there not doing anything. You hit them until your health goes down, then get some space, wait for health to regenerate, hit them some more, then repeat.   It's an average game given that is is free but I could have spent my time playing something better.",

If you have ever played any of the Ys games, this is fundamentally a dumbed-down version of those games with much less dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay.  On top of that, the game was originally written in Japanese, then translated into English... and while the translation is never non-sensical, it is obvious that it was not translated by a native speaker.  But even beyond that... the story just isn't very interesting at all. You're a girl who has lost her sister. You need to go find her. You run into... some people along the way. None of them are very interesting or memorable, nor is the protagonist, for that matter. There is just nothing gripping about the story of this game.  Given the very simplistic, not very rewarding gameplay and the unrewarding story, there is just no reason to play this game. It isn't terrible, but lots of things aren't terrible; for something to be worth your time, it should be actively good.  This is not.  Your time is better spent doing other things.

Perhaps its fits ARPG,but at least not a battle system like this. The music and the art are good. (as a free game) The chapter bosses are fair enough. The monsters and the dungeons are a little poor.

The combat system is pretty simple and easy to use. It feels a bit like playing the early type of Zelda, where you go from one screen to another, hitting monsters, gathering ressources to upgrade your gear, there's a total of 4 skills you can use to make the battle easier. As a fan of JRPG's music, the soundtrack in this game is AMAZING.  Now, there's one downside to this game: the ending(s). I'll let you guys see it for yourselves.  There's a few grammar problems here and there, the game was originally made in Chinese, I'm guessing the translation was not by a professional but it's not important in this case, that's a minor thing. Feel free to try this game, it's finishable in a few hours, and it costs 0$.

Senia displays interesting emotions, and being brave is beautifully shown.

Weapons/armor breaking resembling plot points is quite unique too.

It was an unfinished game, the first in a series, but it's combat system was pretty neat. Like in Eternal Senia, you attack by charging into the enemy. Even if it is more limited due to RPG Maker mechanics, it was really cool to see this concept again - one that I really missed from the first game, that let me longing for a sequel that will never come out.  The character design was incredible. I am not familiar with RPG Maker so I do not know if all the sprites are original from the creator (they too are superb btw), but the drawings for the protagonists and bosses were wonderful for a free game, better than a lot of paid games with anime visuals. The story was great, it is simple but manage to immerse you into the plot, and actually like the characters.  What really got into me was the secret chamber - don't read if you want to discover for yourself. Until then, it was a really good game that I pretty much enjoyed and became attached to the characters; but to see the love invested in this game, and the care the developer devoted to it really moved me. The reference to old games, specially Legend of Mana, made it something special. It was like it could be any of us there, determined to create a game moved by childhood memories, and sharing with people that could possibly get the same feeling. Maybe I am reading too much between the lines, but this line of thought amuses me, and make the fact that it's free even more interesting. I don't know, I give it some thought and this game may as well figure between my favorite games.  The only thing that I quite not liked was the soundtrack. It is not bad, really, but it's just not my thing and it seemed a bit off sometimes. And after some point it became a bitty grindy, and I found myself yearning for the the progress of the story rather than having fun with the combat. Nothing sort of a nuisance though. I am seeking out for the dev next game, if it is expected.",

It was by far one of the best, actually the best, RPG Maker game I've played so far. I will put specifics below.  Story: One of the three biggest things that made this short game amazing and memorable. The story of the main character risking her life to save her older sister is maybe a cliche to an extent, but they got that cliche and made it beautiful. The story has 3 endings total, each one being emotional and memorable. This is one of those select few were I actually loved all the alternate endings. Personally speaking though, the 3rd ending is the best. 8/10 for the story (could easily be 10 if it wasn't only 6hrs long)  Graphics: The second biggest thing that made me love this game. Anyone who played Visual Novels willl more than likely see what I mean when I say these graphics are absolutely amazing. This game has some of the best graphics I've ever seen in RPG Maker games, competing with a lot of Visual Novels. Of course, the gameplay graphic is mediocre, but you can't expect much from RPG Maker in that aspect. (Still amazing for being made in RPG Maker). It's the story images that hit me hard. They were the biggest thing that made me love this game. 9/10 for the graphics  Music: This is definetly important in games. What background to play at what time? Should it be silent? Loud or quite? Fast or slow? Well, this game did an amazing job with the soundtrack. I am using the piano theme on my phone for a ringtone as I type this, and I am loving it. The soundtrack was beautifuly done, adding a lot of emotion to the story and images. 9/10 (the music was beautiful, but a few played several times throughout making it not quite a 10)  Gameplay: The gameplay was interesting in several ways. The creator got rid of the turn-base combat and instead implemented his own. You move around freely and attack enemies by running into them. You also us the buttons 'Q'W'E'R' to use your skills. It sounds sort of simple, which it is, but the enemies make it challenging. Especially the bosses, who have unique skills of their own and can do AOEs causing major damage. I've died by all the main bosses except 2, the first boss (Slime) and the semi-final boss (Final if you get Ending 1). 7.5/10 (feel like more could be added)  Overall, I give the game a 8.5/10. It had a great story combined with both great graphics and music. The controls were simple, yet amazing in their own way. I would most definitely reccomend this FREE game to anyone who loves RPGs and Visual Novels. I would've proudly paid for it if it costed money. =(^,.,^)=  Nominated for the 'I'm not crying' reward. =(^,.,^)=",

I thought it was definitely worth the few hours I put into it, and I admire the developer's dedication and thought put into the game (the crafting system is a good example, being easy to follow while still adding flavor). The soundtrack has its fair share of standout moments, too (personal favorites include 'Inner Forest' and 'Passage of Bravery'). A few minor issues exist here and there (e.g. iffy translations from Chinese, lack of exit game option), but nothing major.  What keeps me from showering this game with praise, though, is that I could never get into the story, or its characters. A quick glance at the reviews suggests that I'm in the minority here, but for me, the story felt unoriginal and uninspiring to the fullest, never deviating from the tired 'love conquers all' theme, never even trying to explore minor intricacies like the mysterious 'Eternity' substance.  So, ultimately, I end up viewing this game as the developer's tribute to eastern RPGs - a soft, quick encapsulation of the genre, but nothing of substance on its own. Do I recommend it? For free, it'd be hard not to. But neither do I think you're missing out if you don't bother.",

Well first off im just gonna say how I felt going thru this game. - I enjoyed it, the story was solid and left me crying in the end. The art was pretty damn good in my opinion. The Characters were very cute and the story between them very nice. The Combat was pretty good being it was made with RPG maker. The enemies were plentiful and they dropped items which were crafting supplies used to make. Armor and weapons. The crafting system was very grindy but that just made me want to put even more time into it. For it being a Chineese/Japanese game the english translation was pretty decent. I found myself pretty happy thru the entirety of the game. Until I played all 3 endings, I bawled at the end of them but I loved all of them as each ending showed how each character felt and showed how the relationship had evolved between the characters. The sound track is Phenominal to be quite frank and if you think its not you have some issues. The level design was very odd but interesting and I often went back to see if I left anything behind me.   Im not going to give this game a number rating, but instead im just going to say. If you loved Anime, and enjoy story and dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about graphics and want a nice dungeon crawler esc. feel to a game. This game is for you and look no further, so quit reading this review and get the damn game and experience the ♥♥♥♥ing beauty of this game.  -Gabe Carter ",

            "review_text": "There are stories where the world is at risk, and the hero must rise up to fight injustice and restore balance to the world. Eternal Senia is not that kind of story.  Despite the first impression the name might give, the game is very short (My [at time of writing] 5.2 hours of playtime was enough to see everything.), but that does not mean it is not also good. I won't go into detail of the story because, since it is so short, just about everything falls under spoiler territory.   The mechanics are very intuitive and easy to get used to. As this is an ARPG, there is no need for navigating battle menus for each time you bump into one of the random mobs wandering around; the player will damage the enemy by simply walking into them. Additionally, there are no random encounters in this game, so the player is free to completely ignore the mobs about 75% of the time. The remaining 25% is when they are blocking the one way forward. Grinding is almost totally unneeded, and simple normal progression will generally keep the player's level and skills high enough to overcome whatever comes their way. Boss battles are done in an interesting way; with the exception of the first and penultimate, they are a static part of the background and the player has to run into one tile where they are vulnerable, while dodging AoE attacks and summoned mobs.  The heroine is developed rather well, as she narrates the backstory between chapters. She also stands out from many RPG heroes by not being chosen by any divine entity or having been predestined to go on a journey; she is just a regular person that knows how to use a sword and has an objective.  Lastly, there are a total of three endings to this game, based on player actions, which can roughly be seen as a bad, normal, and true ending. The game prompts the player to save in the endgame every time they are about to reach a decision gate for determining which ending they get. Because of this, replaying the whole game is not needed to see all the endings.   In the end, this is a good game with an engaging story despite its brevity, and certainly an afternoon could be spared in order to experience this. Word of advice, be ready to cry at the endings.",

I feel as if the songs for each part suits it greatly.  This brings up the fact that, while in full-screen, I could not Shift+Tab to answer a friends message or Alt+Tab'd to call my friend on Skype. This issue needs resolving.  Overall, I would rate this a 9/10 and would cry again!",

            "review_text": "I spent around five hours with this game, debating whether I'm impressed or sad.  The visuals are very simple but there's a lot of care and attention into making every screen make sense. The characters can look a little out of place sometimes, as there are a few sprites here and there which were probably used from the default models from RPGMaker and they don't really go well with the handmade models. The two main characters are also extremely obviously based off of a female Swordsman and a female High Priest, both from the Ragnarok Online MMORPG. I wish the creator would have put a little more work into making them look more unique, because it truly is very obvious. That said, the hand-drawn portraits and models look nice.  Every level is carefully designed with its share of unique challenges, from exploding enemies to platforming. It's genuinely impressive how much love was put into each and every segment of the game world -- even being a linear game, there's a lot of incentive to truly explore and gather materials, as well as tackle the secret levels for special rewards.   The combat system is very reminiscent of the Ys series; this game wears its inspirations on its sleeve but I believe that's a good thing. It's relaxing but, at the same time, it can be quite challenging to overcome certain bosses even though there's not even an attack button. The skill system isn't as fleshed out as it could be and using SP to increase the skills is very simplistic -- most of the time, you'll just want to dump the points in all skills equally but only a couple are really ever truly useful (at least up until where I am). Even still, each skill has its very own application and they stand out from each other.  The story is extremely generic but it keeps itself mysterious enough that it doesn't need to shove itself down your throat. I believe this was the right decision. The narrative wouldn't be interesting enough to flesh out every 30 minutes with exposition so the choice to keep it to a sheer minimum and focus instead on Senia's confusion was appropriate. It's a little weird that all bosses (up until where I am) are basically variations of a succubus but that's not a real complaint or anything. Just something that annoyed me a little bit. I'd also like to point out that the game's text sometimes suffers from a severe lack of proof-reading by a fluent English speaker. There are a LOT of grammar mistakes and even some conveyance problems, particularly in dialogue. It's too bad because it harms the already very vanilla storyline. It's an issue that's easily fixed. It may add to the charm for some players but, in my case, it's a little cringy at times.  I noted at the start that I didn't know whether to be impressed or sad. This is because, on one hand, I'm impressed at the amount of sheer love the creator put into making this game. Most complaints I noted above could be justified by the fact that the game was made on absolutely no budget and it's being distributed for free. I'm sad, however, because this is one of those games which will find it very hard to get publicized due to its nonexistent marketing campaign and minimalistic approach.  As an indie game, this is clearly a step behind a lot of videogames as far as technology goes. As a labour of love, being distributed at absolutely no cost, with no DLC or any strings attached, this deserves my utmost respect and admiration.  This is free. Download it. Play it proudly. Now.",

That's it, that's all the negatives I could think of, otherwise, even the combat is very solid and enjoyable, the only awkwardness being in the somewhat random knockback mechanics.  TLDR(lolwat?) - PLAY THIS GAME!",

The puzzles were challenging enough that you will probably miss one each area but they allow you to fast travel to make it easier as well as providing a randomly generated hallway to farm materials if you are interested in crafting everything.  Also, there is no penalty for choosing easy mode for boss fights which I really appreciated. Would definitely reccomend.

I would reccomend the game to people who are more interested in story then gameplay.  My only 2 minor complaints are that:  - dungeons in the game are rather easy(with exception of boss fights which you can play in Hard Mode). But, considering the strong point of this game is story this isn't as big of a problem considering there will be a lot of players who will just want to push trough to see what happens next)comendations to the developer for includeing 'easy mode' in boss fights for this kind of players).  - English is a bit broken here and there.

This game has a girl that loves to use ellipses and is obsessed with her motherly sister/friend/lover? That's all you can say really. The main character doesn't want to explain her feelings or get into any d e pth. She just wants to find her 'sister' and go home.   Anyway, I liked ending 2 out of 3 because all of them are really the same but it actually lead to a conclusion that made a little bit of sense. And I didn't get ending 1 because  I wore Nia's cross in the fi n al boss battle.    So there you go, I guess I recommend it. It all ends up feeling like  a never end i ng loop with the best ending  but if you want to kill around 5 hours this is an ok free game to try.

I've beaten the game 100 % getting everything I could!  --General  Graphics are the usual type made half 3D. Sadly bosses lack any sort of animation, which is fixed by adding interesting attacks (lasers seem to be quite popular!)  Gameplay is simple and addicting. You have few skills to use, but main fighting goes by simply walking into the enemies to cause damage. Leveling up really feels like you get a lot stronger, and though upgrading your gear is slightly grindy, it's still decently fast and with this fighting style it's also a bit of fun.  Music.. Cant say much about it, it was good enough for me and my friend to pretty much sing along with it, by reading the texts aloud in the music rhytm :)  Story in the game is good and involving, nothing epic, on the contrary it could be the story of an average family, with some monsters and magic mixed up with, making it more believable and much better than your usual plotlines. And the ending.. I loved it! It breaks the usual ending format slightly as well with a twist.  Also checking out the Dev-room was a nice extra to see inside the effort put into making the game.  --Negatives  On the other side, the bosses lacked animation and at some points that felt out of place compared to the rest of the feel in the game. I guess bosses need to look different after all. Even though the bossfights were fun and all, if they had atleast moved a few pixels up and down hovering it would've been better in my opinion, to make them look alive instead of paintings. Developers did explain the reason for this in the Dev-room.  The game was also really easy most of the time, while the bosses were challenging on hardmode and seemed to require some extra care. If only the normal enemies midgame onwards would've required slightly more to beat as well. Now I know this game must've been hard for some people, but since the bosses had hardmode, I would've loved to play hardmode even outside bossfights.  --Overall  I loved every moment of this game and definetly would recommend it to other people! It's also free so even if you dont know the genre this is a good game to try get in on!  For the developers: Good job! I will eagerly wait and hope for more games from you!  9/10",

You're thrown into a basic tutorial dungeon right away, and the story is then explained by flashbacks. I currently haven't beaten the game yet, but the story is great and I won't be spoiling any of it here. At first I thought the combat was choppy, which it is because it's using RPG Maker's (VX Ace or XP I'm not sure, most likely XP) tile system for movement which means you can do a dash attack and go through an enemy because technically he's in a transitionary limbo. However after the first boss in the tutorial and after fighting medusa, I realized that the combat is actually really good. Overall I'd say the combat is pretty much like a top down Zelda game. Next I'd have to say the UI is really good looking and custom made, so is character art. There's a neat skill system and it always makes me feel as if I'm progressing which helps things to flow and stay interesting. In conclusion I'd say this game is amazing especially since it's free. My only complaint would be the heavy reliance on RPG Maker's default assets. So finally, I'd give this game a 9/10  Pros ------------------------- - Awesome music - Smooth combat - Good story - Good art - Pretty UI - It's free -------------------------  Cons ------------------------- - Too many RPG Maker assets - Although good combat can sometimes feel awkward and choppy - Music...Just kidding the music kicks ♥♥♥! -------------------------  Tl;Dr: Its an amazing game.

I know it says that I played this game for 5 minutes but I played it in offline mode so yeah.  This game will seriously bother me for a loong time, I would probably space out a lot. I dont know if I regreted playing this or not because I have mixed feelings about the game right now I mean I do love the game, I love how simple it is, their artwork, the story, I downloaded the game just for the story, and everything else. I dont know if I should be proud because I did not cry or shed a tear, I dunno I have always been emotionless to everything. I am such a horrible person, but anyways It is seriously a great game if you are more on the story than the game then you guys should play it, too bad there is no secret ending.  So what are you waiting for? buy a box of tissue and start playing already.   You dont need realistic graphic to make an awesome game, all you need is a story, and that whats make an awesome game.  The game needs more characters tho.   (I am sorry for any grammar mistakes I have made, it is just that everytime I write or typed something long, I lose my grammar) ",

            "review_text": "As a poverty gamer, Eternal Senia caught my eyes.   First thing I noticed right after I clicked 'START' is that Senia's sprite is pretty flat and ugly. The illustration is decent but a lot of the visuals left a bit of a bad impression. I messed with the menu screen a bit and the volume slider is much appreciated and the brightness control is a neat bonus. Then I walked through the corridors filled with enemies the player needs to bump into to kill. Fun! No, it was bland and by the third room or so I started rationalizing 'it's free after all'.   Some things happened and there was a cutscene and it signalled to me that the creator was trying after all. Then I met the first boss; then it got angry. At that point, a switch in my head was flipped.   From then on, I went through this game thinking how rather thoughtfully designed it is. A lot of the enemies have some neat gimmick, albeit same-y. The (large) boss fights are fun and they have 'unique' visuals. The skills are all awesome. The maps almost always have something to make it more interesting (i.e. puzzles, etc).  The upgrade system (skill enhancement and crafting plus bonuses) is more of a hodgepodge. But as imperfect as it is, half of it requires the player to pretty much just play the game while the other half, although a bit of a chore, makes for relatively fun games within the game.  I have only one actual complaint about this. It doesn't let the player go back to the previous areas, or if it does, it should make it more obvious. Nothing much is lost though, even if the player missed something, they're just a few stats upgrade and equipment that is quickly outclassed. If the player missed too much though, I'm pretty sure the best weapon and armor are locked out.  Finally, the story--it's decent. It is based on miscommunication and 'misaligned' expectations and whatnot. So people who doesn't like that, take note. The characters aren't too compelling for me but I'm sure they are relatable to enough people.",

The storyline is okay, with the occasional flashback here and there.  Still, I have to admit that the game was a bit depressing.  If there was a sequel, I would probably play it, given that the last ending route did leave some unanswered question leading to many interpretations.",
