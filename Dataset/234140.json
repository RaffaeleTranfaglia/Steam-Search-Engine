            "review_text": "Mad Max is an intriguing game to review, and a tough one to succinctly assess. It captures the atmosphere of its source material very well, presenting an open world of majestic dunes and industrial wreckage, replete with anarchy, chaos and quasi-spiritual linguistic quirks. Avalanche toss players right into this turbulent land, and the game thrives in the moments where Max is jostling with War Boy raiders on the open road or tossing ignited cans of gasoline into their scrappy fortresses. But it’s also a title which seems, at some point, to have gone through significant changes (perhaps related to its delay in 2014), and some of the hastier joins around the story pacing, resource systems and progression mechanics still remain.  Befitting of a Mad Max game, the vast majority of the plot concerns Max’s tireless quest for a V8 engine. He’s forced to build a new car (with the help of the irrepressible sidekick/acolyte Chumbucket), after his famous Interceptor is stolen by a roid-abusing chap with the very Mad Max name of Scabrous Scrotus. Though this encounter leaves him bruised and bereft of car, clothes and equipment, Max does at least leave a chainsaw blade in Scrotus’ forehead for good measure. In order to piece together a vehicle worthy of Chumbucket’s ‘Magnum Opus’ moniker, Max needs to roam the dusty wastelands, scavenging scrap, trading favours with local warlords, and ramming or punching every War Boy, Buzzard or general road filth who tries to get in his way.  Pretty much everything in Mad Max is upgraded through the scrap resource (including, somewhat bizarrely, Max’s combat skills), so any of the open world activities that reward scrap are potentially worth doing. Luckily, that’s basically all of them; so unless you have a worrying compulsion to clear the entire map of icons it’s possible to almost exclusively stick to the things you enjoy. A few of the story missions will force you into owning certain upgrades or tackling specific side-areas, but this is kept in moderation.  Avalanche’s art team have done just as tremendous a job as their technical division (the game runs incredibly well even on minimum-spec PCs), creating a dozen or so desert zones that actually look distinct from one another. Red, Mojave-like scrublands border rolling dunes, which in turn become rockier, mesa-filled landscapes, or areas pocketed by vents of near-luminous sulfur. For an area of land that’s ostensibly barren, it offers a palette of bold colours and striking, post-civilisation landmarks.  Roaring through these realms in pursuit of a convoy, harpoon primed to pull wheels off escorts, War Boy boarders tumbling in your wake, and a well-aimed shotgun blast turning another wheeled foe into a spinning, combusting ball of debris, is one of Mad Max’s most exhilarating diversions. The versatile Shadow of Mordor-esque photo mode isn’t just in the game for moody shots of the desert, it’s also for snapping some of the magnificent explosions in full bloom.  The various camps, hide-aways, and ramshackle dwellings scattered across the wastes do eventually end up seeming over-familiar. For a decent while though, it’s a delight to roll up on a new location, comb it for scrap, engage in some un-gentlemanly BatMax fisticuffs with the locals, and explore whether there are any unique, handcrafted little dioramas contained with. Such encounters are only enhanced by the random events of Max’s world. You may end up having to deal with a honking patrol showing up while you’re on foot and vulnerable, or a powerful dust storm bellowing its way across the dry earth.  Of such things are the finest of Mad Max’s moments made. There are some shonkier aspects though, which aren’t gigantic problems in themselves but are amplified by being repeated across hours upon hours of playing. Max has a bit of a case of ‘Geralt movement’, where the weight of his animation will often carry him beyond the ladder, box of scrap, or weapon you’re trying to line him up with. A great many things in this game demand that you stand somewhat perfectly in front of them and hold down E (or equivalent) for a bit, so that gets rather old.  It’s also extremely aggravating to have to watch an almost-cut-scene every single time Max tips gasoline into something or refills his water canteen (effectively your back-up health potion, and probably preferable to the other options of consuming maggots and dog food). This is borderline crazy, because I’m pretty sure it all still happens in-engine. Having the game cut to black after those actions makes very little sense. If modding is ever possible, the removal of these repeat irritations must be a priority.  Though it doesn’t directly detract from a lot of the fun, Mad Max shows various signs of features being hastily changed or wrapped up before they were quite ready. The game’s opening tries to impress the importance of fuel and water for survival, when in fact those resources are now found in abundance across the wasteland (I never ran out of fuel, and having an empty canteen has no additional penalty).  Every ‘Top Dog’ mini-boss looks basically the same, attacks in the same manner (a couple do have assistance from underlings), and may even use the same voice actor. Encounters in the wasteland offer ‘intel’ on these fights, vaguely hinting at a sort of Mordor Nemesis system of particular weaknesses, but it’s obvious stuff like ‘he doesn’t like being shivved in the neck!’ The same tactics which work on all of them. Clearing minefields seems like a hold-over from a time where Max was intended to regularly use a wider selection of vehicles than the Magnum Opus. You can still collect a full set of cars, but outside of races or a sneaky plan to drop mines in front of a convoy, only the mine-clearing buggy (and attendant dog) has such a specific purpose.  Unfortunately, some of the Magnum Opus upgrades are tied to the reduction of ‘threat’ in different regions, and that can mean having to take time off from your campaign of chaos to settle into some familiar busywork. Getting the top level harpoon (the only one which can reliably yank down the most hardy ‘scarecrow’ structures dotted around the land, and one of the most hilarious weapons overall), means sniffing out a whole lot of minefields.  Some of the unlocking methodology may irritate, but the way upgrades for the Opus are handled is quite novel. Later armor and ramming options are not automatically the best way to go; they’re heavy, and become a trade-off with speed and handling. In this sense, you do actually have to design a workable car to some extent. It’s refreshing that the ‘last’ upgrade in a chain isn’t automatically superior by default, but is instead a new variable to consider.   Mad Max has its fair share of quirks and odd design decisions, but creates a sandbox of anarchic chaos that’s both wonderfully rendered and, on PC, a technical marvel. A word on the sound design too, which is just as responsible as the art design and animation for capturing the whump of explosions and jaw-breaking punches alike. There’s much to revel in. But although it’s appropriate that a game from this universe should feel like some aspects are misshapen or hastily bodged into shape to fit a grander vision, the annoyances really peel away at you over the course of a title as long as this one. Like the original 1979 film, Mad Max seems destined to be a cult classic; beloved by many, in spite of the components that appear to have been ripped out and reassembled, or otherwise abandoned to the desert basin.",

Well, it's simple --  Mad Max  is an excellent amalgamation of tried and true, well-polished sandbox mechanics that serves as the ideal interactive tribute to the extensive Mad Max film canon. Hardly revolutionary, but by all means fun, engaging and superbly optimized.",

First of all it works great (nice optimalization) ! 60 FPS as a starting point gives smoothness especially needed in car chases (btw car mechanics are cool). Incredible vistas! They are rather minimalistic in details but this is a good thing. The feeling of isolation is palpable here. Also the different color moods are fantastic! Another good thing is hand to hand combat. It's got batman's formula and It's enjoyable. The story is ok with many cool looking characters but don't expect to much. The downside is too busy map. The core of the game is grinding for scrap but with two good mechanics like driving/combat you don't mind doing so. Overall I give it 9/10 score-(if you don't like post-apo then 8/10) great fluid car-combat gameplay with beautiful scenery!",

Starts out as annoying hunchback-clone from 300, but grows on you.   -Repetitive. Repetitive. Repetitive. Re...you get the point.  -Minefields. These really suck. Drive around semi-randomly, wait for dog to cry, exit car, press and hold E.  -No story. I mean none.  -Large green or purple dot stays on screen to denote a destination removes immersiion. We already have a map, mini-map, and green line on mini-map leading us to destination. This is an over-the-top, unnecessary dumb-down. -Superflous button-mashing; I understand the batman style melee mash, but 'Press and hold E to mash' certain chests and doors? Why, developer, why?? -Ladders: first you have to line up with them just right, press E to get on, and slowly trudge rung by rung until you make it to the top.  -'Press and hold E to collect scrap' Why the hell do we have to hold a button for no damn good reason?   7/10 Will return to Jeet's Stronghold again.",

            "review_text": "Genre - Post-Apocalyptic 3rd Person Action/RPG  I have watched the Mad Max films and really enjoyed the latest installment. When I first heard of this game I thought 'oh a movie tie in that will follow the film plot and be pretty pointless'. However, I was able to get this game on a good deal and was surprised to find this a great example of how to do a movie tie in.  You take the role of Mad Max and meet a character called Chum Bucket early on. You then spend the time together helping out allies by destroying enemy landmarks and capturing camps. As you progress you earn scrap that can be used to upgrade your car and Max himself.  You spend a lot of the game in your car, which you would expect, and the battles you have with other road users seem to work well with Harpoons and your Shotgun being essential gear.  The story itself is short and sweet, and It is in addition to the film and allows you to delve into Max's world even deeper. As you are in a fairly open world you can also compete in races, collect relics or farm scrap to your hearts desire. I plugged many hours into the game doing just that and although I have had my fill, did not manage to get all the achievements by the games end. I might be tempted to go back though at a later date.  The game isn't too difficult but adds a fair challenge at certain stages and is great fun to play. Definately in my top 5 games of 2015. Unfortunately I think it was over shadowed by Metal Gear being released at a similar time.   Now I am just hoping for a Bullet Farm DLC. ",

            "review_text": "*Note: I'm almost five hours into an open world game that could potentially take 30+ hours to completely clear based on the huge map. I've sampled every different type of open world activity and have unlocked all the core 'equipment' under Max's glossary.  Let's start with what Mad Max *isn't* for those who may be looking for something specific: Mad Max is not a survival game. It has gameplay elements that sound like they would belong in a survival game like water and food scrounging, but this is an open world sandbox action game. Because it's an open world game, it's not as focused on delivering a narrative and tightly scripted action scenes as the recent 'Fury Road'.  Now let's get down to what Mad Max is. Mad Max is an excellent open world sandbox in the vein of Just Cause. I say 'sandbox' specifically because this game gives you a vast number of things to do and unleashes you upon the world to do them. Besides a few main quest goals (the story is frontloaded in the first few hours, as far as I can tell), you are given leave to plunder the wasteland while reducing the threat level presented by the big bad warlord Max is seeking to topple.  The graphics in Max's wasteland are solid and I never felt like the world was merely one big desert. This really becomes apparent when you ascend in a scouting balloon and see just how many interesting land features there are to explore. In a way it reminds me of the Fallout series, barren but interesting. The sound design, though, is the real star. Engines revving, powerful explosions, and the crack of Max's shotgun and punches really sell the brutal experience.  I can see the core gameplay loop of Max getting old if you don't particularly enjoy the activities of car combat, fighting, and exploring camps. However, I quite enjoyed the 'Arkham' style combat and the great combat racing that allows you to slow down time to execute amazing attacks against foes that scream along the roads at breakneck speeds.I think it's safe to say that if you played tons of Just Cause (the other game these devs are famous for) then you'll love this game, but if you're looking for an open world game with an involved narrative like GTA or The Witcher, you may be less excited to take your twentieth bandit camp.  I'd say Mad Max is a definitely worth a buy if you love the post apocalypse and want to spend hours tweaking a cool car, exploring camps and caves, and turning Max from a scrawny survivor into a Top Dog of the wastes (with an epic beard to match).",

            "review_text": "An open-world adventure game, full of salt, gasoline, blood, crushed metals and souls. Bitterness prevails above all of it. Still, this one is the helluva fun ride, all the way down the road.  You can finish it in 10-20 hours, going straight through quests, but that would be a waste of time, from my point of view. Like I said, the game has bitter taste, and the story line will not give you satisfaction after final screen. So I beg you: play it like open-world adventure. Don't mind major quests, until you really have to. Just get yourself a decent car, and go for exploring this land. Eroded, crumbled to dust, but still striving for survival.  Some time ago, I was really fond to Far Cry 2, which was baptized as horrid and bleak by the majority of players. But I found in Far Cry 2 one thing, for it can be loved: the driving part. Here in Mad Max, the same feeling of driving through wasteland, where there are no actual roads, only directions, and it goes 10 times better than in Far Cry 2!  Let's settle pro and contra:  + Graphics and optimization are very good parts. All is smooth and fine with that.  + Driving is the selling point. It is one of a kind experience, I suggest everyone to get at least some of it.  + Fighting part is very similar to Batman's games, or Sleeping Dogs - strike and strong strike, parry&amp;reposte, combo... It goes fine, for the most time. Although some moves Max showing are certainly not fit the realistic setting the game's narrative assuming. But the same can be said about the whole game: the realism is here, but steps away to make some emotions brighter. Still, after about 200-300 broken jaws, it is finally not that fun, as with Bats or Wei Shen... The Shadow of Mordor gives much more contentment, than Mad Max, at this point.  + The gameplay main features certainly looks familiar. Fighting from Batman, scrap collecting and gear tuning from Tomb Raider... you can proceed with the list, but here's the main thing: it was blended alright. Unlike Watch Dogs, Mad Max gameplay is not seems like Frankenstein style. All things there at right places, so the final expression the game gives is pure. You're getting a fresh new game out of long-known features. A good deal.  - The only strong point I have against this game is amusingly overall accolade to Death. All those skulls, achievement for eating maggots nesting in the rotting corpses... All that gore is an over-act, an over-kill and exaggeration of the Apocalypse theme. I felt disgust sometimes during playtime. So I'm certainly not recommending Mad Max to kids or to sensitive persons.  - The game is open-world, but it contains almost none of any sandbox experience. After you clear the given territory from the enemy presence, there are absolutely nothing to do. So you can't play this game by hundreds of hours, like Skyrim. Unless you really like driving in wastelands over all other gaming experience, of course.  In sum: Mad Max is pure and solid action game. Very brutal, and quite entertaining for some time. You ride a death car, right in the middle with the real world and hell. And while your good deeds somehow fixing something around you, your hero goes deeper and deeper on the dark side. Very nice and very grim adventure in the post-apocalypse crack of world we used to know. Give it a go, but leave any hopes before entering.  I mark it as 7.9/10. I like it very much, but it hurts something inside me. Let's just pray we'll never see this dream come true.",

A great many types of vehicles are in the game, and a great many tactical options to fight them. No other game has handled car-combat with such finesse.  2. The game is a must buy for Mad Max fans. The atmostphere is very faithful to the movies.  3. Customizing and upgrading your vehicle 'Magnum Opus' is a lot of fun. There many options, most of them are meaningful and open up new ways to play.  4. Production values are superb. Audio, visuals, the design and voice casting of enemies and in-game characters, all beautifully done, bring the wastelands to 'life', as much as can be possible.  5. Combat is reminiscent of Shadow of Mordor, with a bit of gun combat mixed in.  6. The wastland is pretty massive. Quite a lot of things to do in the game - car combat, capturing strongholds, improving allied bases, boss fights, even car races. A lot more than many famous open-world games.   Cons  1. Some of the missions and tasks can be a bit of a chore (eg Mine clearing).  2. Melee combat can become monotonous by the end, especially in contrast to vehicular combat. Car combat remains so much more entertaining that I sometimes avoid getting out of the car whenever possible.  3. I wish there were more settlements and characters in the game (but given the wasteland setting, I doubt there is much the devs could have done).  Overall. a definite buy at anything more than a 25% discount. One of the better movie adaptations ever produced.",

Mad Max is a third person, action game set in an open world enviroment, based on the Mad Max film series. It was released on September 1st 2015 on PC, PS4 and XBOX One. You can explore plenty of deserts, canyons, wreckage, tunnels, hills. In the story, Max's car was stolen in wasteland by Scrotus. Then Scrotus beaten and threw him into Chumbucket's region. After few minutes Max wakes up and found Chumbucket. Then Chumbucket helps Max to build a war machine for Wasteland War. After all this, journey begins.  Mad Max featured with massive open world map. We can do several things in Wasteland. Like terminating Snipers, Camps, Stop Dogs, Scarecrows. Even we can play Death Run races. Like Time Bomb and Finish The Line. We can earn cars by winning Death Run races as reward. There are many types of cars available for our collection.  We can make better and proper progress if we play this game accordingly. There are quiet numbers of Side missions. We can earn great numbers of scraps for upgrading Magnum Opus, Max, Chumbucket, Weapons.  If you wants to upgrade everything then you have to increase your legend rank. Making progress of legend rank will unlock new upgrades for Max. Terminating Camps, Convoys, Minefields, Snipers, Scarecrows will reduce threat meter to 0 from 5. This will also unlock new upgrades for Magnum Opus.  Pros ::: 1. Realistic Graphics Quality. 2. There are few things to do in Wasteland. 3. Plenty of Side missions. 4. The fuel system and filling my cane with water is really amazing way for better focus in this game. 5. This game featured with massive open world map. 6. Highly Optimized Game. I am really impressed with it's optimization. 7. Story feels really epic and emotional. 8. Really a great style of combat with Fury Killing Ability. 9. Driving Magnum Opus feels really comfortable. 10. We can upgrade Max, Magnum Opus, Chumbucket, Strongholds.  You can rebuild strongholds by Project Parts. You have to collect Project Parts after tracking them on your map. Like if you build Scrap Crew then this Crew will collect scraps from all over the Wasteland while your game is off. But you must need Internet Connection for collecting those scraps from Crew.  You can play this game better if you upgrade your harpoon to level 6 which is max level of harpoon weapon. Also try to upgrade Max's Knucles and Jacket for his better defence.There are many types of enemy out there with upgraded in highly power. So you need best defence for Max that he can fight longer and defeat them.  This game is highly optimized. You can play this game smoothly with low mode settings in your low config. If you got Intel Core i5 with 8GB RAM and 2GB GDDR5 then you can explore Wasteland in Ultra High Settings.  Let me tell you that i am the 1st finisher of this game in Bangladesh. I got a best name for this game. Name's The Rising Legend. I found a best game after many years later. Like Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed Revelations, Life is Strange, Tomb Raider, Metro Last Light, Deus-Ex Human Revolution. Really it's a amazing game with epic and emotional ending. The ending of this game made me so much weak. The price of this game worth it highly. So that's what i want to say about this game.",

            "review_text": "Amongst a multitude of open world games with maps littered by icons for collectibles as a substitute for gaming content,  Mad Max  does something with the genre: it turns all of these collectibles into exploration pieces. This doesn't exactly  solve  the problem; exploring over a hundred of tiny settlements becomes as tedious as hunting down a hundred of other collectibles, but it does turn what would be a collectathon into a series of adventures and the resulting product is that much richer for it.  Mad Max is at its best whenever it turns into a dungeon crawler in post-apocalyptic Australia. Imagine  Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor  where instead of gaining intel on orc warlords you gain intel to take down enemy bases. Scout enemy camps from afar before taking out their perimeter defenses in your V6 engine car, then battle it out inside while seeking treasure troves of metal scraps.  The features are what sets Mad Max apart from other games. There are definite improvements to the traditional Batman-style melee while car combat has a range of over-the-top special attacks such as the harpoon slam, drive-by shootings, THUNDERPOONS and flaming jets of incineration. Meanwhile, the weakness in the main story actually made me wistful for the  Assassin's Creed  franchise! Say what you will about their game balance; you knew absurd action hero ♥♥♥♥ was gonna go down the minute you accepted that Story Mission! Here it's the opposite: Story Missions are quite tame and most of the value comes from investigating non-essential camps and hunting down enemy convoys.  One must enjoy the greater changes Mad Max brings to the genre if they are to appreciate their purchase. This could've just as easily been a negative review if I nitpicked every little thing that went wrong: Top Dog bosses follow identical patterns, the vehicles you collect from the enemy serve no purpose, ditto the archangel 'alternative car builds', some cars are deliberately rendered hard to maneuver as artificial difficulty, the greatest threat to your lifebar is an impromptu event against which you are completely helpless (OH NO, A MIGHTY DUSTER!), same ol' chore list of tasks to do ('kill 20 enemies with wall finishers.' No, stop adding those), not to mention the glaring elephant in the room:   you are STILL searching for collectibles!   They're just properly hidden as part of your (side-) adventure rather than showcased on a map, so you end up longing for those traditional map icons whenever you're stuck searching for that one final object and be done with a particular encampment!  Most games have you seek out upgrades in side quests, Mad Max makes upgrading your V6 engine into a V8 the main plot of the game. It's true! You get your car stolen in the opening, you vow vengeance, you find a substitute which you'll upgrade with better wheels, armor and such but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if Max Rockastansky is gonna drive anything with less than 8 cylinders of pure power! This is literally 'Upgrades: the Game'. Assault the various strongholds of Scabrous Scrotous to unlock upgrades, collect piles of scrap to pay for upgrades, perform feats of daring-do (or kill 20 enemies with wall finishers) for character upgrades. This is...  'pure extract of open world game' . Mind you; the upgrades are indeed wonderful, but there should be more to games than just upgrades. I don't want to play the world's most skillful scrap collector.  There's just so much good in this game for it to warrant a Thumbs Down, despite my numerous gripes. However, I obviously cannot recommend this to anyone burnt out on open world games at the risk of seeing them puke map icons. Important: check your system requirements before purchasing as this game actually caused my computer to overheat when played at its highest graphical settings. If you're still on the fence, consider watching a few Let's Plays. I promise it won't spoil the story.  REVIEW SLIGHTLY EDITED FOR LENGTH",

It is Mad Max for bananas sake, this is a must play game for post-apocalyptic fans and especially Mad Max fans. It plays like a blend of Tomb Raider (2016) and GTA, meaning it has a nice combat flow but doesn't focus on it as much as it does on the cars. GG 4.5/5! ",

The car combat is fun and i thrilling, there is nothing more satisfying than ripping enemy driver out of their car with the harpoon gun.   The hand to hand combat is reminiscent of Shadow of Mordor and the Batman games, i know not everyone likes that style of combat but i think it fits very well into this style of game.  I love richness of the upgrade system for the car, aswell as the items and clothing that you can unlock for Max himself.  Cons:  To be completely honest i haven't found anything that i dislike in the game as of yet. In certain open world games i get tired of the hugeness of the maps but by having the car to travel around in its not like it takes you that long to get you from A to B and engage in some vehicle combat inbetween.  Overall i am thoroughly enjoying it so far. In my opinion i feel its a shame that it was released on the same day as MGSV as i feel that a lot of people will play that first and probably try and pick this up later on in the year.",

            "review_text": "All I remember of Mad Max was a dusty Mel Gibson, a big bad car, and feeling a connection to the desperate wanderers he came across. In a way, it's one of the first apocalyptic worlds I'd ever seen. It has it's appeal. Thunderdome and Tina Turner with the crazies and bloodlust. These days it's all post-apocalyptic hell with zombies, so seeing a wasteland in a new but familiar universe of Mad Max wasn't hard to process and a nice change for all the end-of-the-world-ness in games I see.  Well then, what's it all about? Giant open world areas, some fun car caravan takedowns, the usual batman-eque fighting, using a fast car to destroy stuff, and mostly enjoying the world of Mad Max in a video game. A first I thought, 'Ok, Batman-junior with a car. Not bad'. There is a fervor in the knuckle-fighting that is Max. It's not a precise brawler, yet not a hack n slash either. I couldn't really stop, though. Insert coin, get video game fast food adrenaline rush. My goal was to try and take them all down without firing a shot, that made the fights extra edgy.   The fun bit for *me*, though....the open world car takedowns. And this varies from gamer to gamer because some folks dislike open world. Personally, I just dive in and forget to actually play the missions. After playing for a few hours I left the main campaign and drove around the open world leveling up for 20+ hrs. Then I got back to the campaign all uber-leveled with a wonderfully growling car only to find I could not get to the next mission. I wasted about an hour or more trying to get it to work. Finally, I gave up and looked online. I found I had to level *down* my car to get to the next mission. What is up with that? At least give me a hint, but to keep it completely out of the mission description? Weird. Why bother making an open world if you need a linear leveling playthrough? So, *that* kinda stunk.  Next up was learning to attack cars, gates, and snipers with my grapple hook. Soon to be upgraded to a THUNDERPOON. Yep, it's called a THUNDERPOON. Basically having a lightweight RPG gunner in the back of your car. Sweet. But I preferred the grapple personally. Maybe it's more batman-ish, but I enjoyed aiming it at tires and stopping bad guys with a hook to the chest. Pooning was a bit too easy and I only used it for aiming at gas tanks at camps. Some of those camps had several flame inducing gas tanks, snipers in tight areas, and defense towers made of shooting fireballs. These were a great joy to attack. That was the best part really. Once you got past the defenses, you crack some heads until you get to a mini-boss with minions and usually giant blazing stationary flamethowers. I ran my bosses into those as a fast way to finish. The problem? ALL the mini-bosses were like that. It got old after awhile. Even down to the last side mission, it was all the same attack, evade, attack. Not much to it. Makes me scratch my head how come they didn't add some variety to the bosses. It would have added so much more to the game if *any* of them had some special abilities.  Now I loved the driving and chasing the bad guy on their supply routes. It was sorta GTA style and even though the car was hard to maneuver I never got tired of it. You can add more armor and stabilizers to get better handling, but I found the armor slowed me down. Better to stay light to keep up. Unless you skid out of control and end up in a ditch. But, the car could take a good beating. The death runs were okay and just required a bit of practice to remember where to slow down and speed up. Using nitro was also a good help on a straight path with it's fast speed boost, but in general made me lose total control if I made any sort of turn. What NAILED me was the race against Stank Gum. It was there - after a bajillion attempts - that i realized i had too much armor and needed to lighten up the car to keep up. Once I did that, i was able to complete the mission with just a handful of tries. That can be the hardest part of the game, or the easiest. Depends how good you are at driving games and how heavy your car is when you start.  Right around that part of the game, the story *finally* gets interesting. Before, it was mostly summer-movie-story-action filler. But towards the last 15% of the game the story makes some good progress. Which is great because after awhile I would just get bored and chat with my buddies on steam or watch twitch while I played 10 minutes every hr.  Some nights I'd play maybe 20 minutes with the game running all night long. I was losing my interest pretty bad. Past the Stank Gum mission, though, you may finish the game a little faster because it's getting more varied as you go. I will say the end mission is pretty decent and I felt like it was a good ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but that ending was a lot better than say the ending to Shadow of Mordor. I had to play the Bright Lord DLC to get a good ending to Mordor - which is a shame because I *loved* Mordor other than that ending. Mad Max ends well and becomes a decent game towards the last 15% of the campaign.  Story isn't much, but it's voice acted well and frankly I liked the storyline more than the movie. That isn't saying much because the movie was mostly an action packed sequence with little dialogue going on ( in my opinion ). But the game has a lot more going on. What it *is* missing is the connection to the people surviving out there in the vast dry death of a world Max lives in. You get some connections here and there, but mostly you bounce from camp to camp and just do missions without really talking to anyone. Where is the love? Max is a loner, I get it. But, wow, there wasn't anything even close to a personal experience until the end.   Art direction is a gritty gorgeous wasteland. A perfect Mad Max open world with quite a lot of detailed landscape and nicely working physics. I got into it. Maybe I'm a loner too, who knows, but it appealed to me. At least until I finished and decided I need to move on to my backlog again. Lemme drive all over and smash into bad guy cars. I loved that.  One more thing towards the end - and here I will be critical - it gets more and more glitchy. A few scenes had my car inside of another car, I drove all the way to the end of a mission only to get stuck on geometry for 15 minutes while i wiggled everything possible, and the occasional cutscene where the person's head disappeared. But my biggest gripe was the last side quest. Someone decided to make it only work *at night*.  I could not fast forward time! I tried upgrading the camps with scrap metal which seems to fast forward time a bit, but it would miss the nighttime somehow. So, i drove around for over 2 hrs until I got to a night scene in order to finish the game sidequests. That was *so* annoying. Somebody got cut a check for that idea. Arrgh. Please WB, it's *not* fun or challenging. *Don't* do that again.  Overall, a solid entry. Nothing spectacular, but it has it's good points if you enjoy driving recklessly beating up brighly painted shirtless dudes in an open world. Amazing? Nope. Bad ♥♥♥? Nope. Worth the time? Um, yeah, as long as you like the above statement on driving and don't expect much variety in the bosses. Plus, you get to be Mad Max! 7/10.",

But, you know what.. Let me introduce you seven fundamental reasons why the game forces you to play it!  1. Optimalization. What a perfect optimalization!  ... forget on Batman´s epic fail. On the highest settings the game runs like a Swiss watch. Many thanks to Avalanche studios for really good job.  2. Wasteland. What a atmospheric wasteland!  ... really big, really large and variable.   3. Details. What a impressive details!  ... fortresses, various locations, points of interests and more.  4. Sandstorms. What a real sandstorms! ... I can´t remember better processed video games sandstorms. Maybe in Spec Ops: The Line, but in Mad Max sandstorm appears randomly in two variants.  5. Ride. What a rough ride!  ... feeling of riding is really enjoyable. Not only in Magnum Opus.  6. Combat system. What a brutal combat system!  ... simple but effective. You know his older and better brother from Arkham series.  7. Visualization. What a sexy visualization!  ... nice graphics, effects of explosions, mentioned locations.   After 15 hours of gameplay, Mad Max caught a second wind, gets momentum and simply will not let you go. Despite the fact you´re doing the same thing all the time.  I´d like to support devs by purchase upcoming Just Casuse 3. They deserved it in times of terrible console ports.         Mad Max&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "It is a hell of a ride.   The game is definitely more than the sum of its parts, and it can be pretty rough in some parts, but man, what a damn ride.  The game's on foot combat is pretty much just doing a Batman/Sleeping Dogs thing. Not as fluid as either, and somehow less brutal than Sleeping Dogs's. It gets old. There are nice ways to avoid it, since the shotgun is pretty much a 'end this fight' button, and while the ammo for it is plentiful, it is scarce enough that you are encouraged to save it for big fights. It is always great to reenact the swordfightning scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but just like in that movie, you can run out of projectiles at the worst possible moment.   The driving is a VERY big part of the game, as it should be, since this is Mad Max we are talking about.  The environments are pretty distinct from each other, which makes travelling a pleasure. The bad part comes that for the optional races, you generally get to use a completely different car that handles unlike your custom rig, and it gets a bit hard due to not being used to the handling of the race cars.   Vehicle variety also suffers, since it feels like the factions each have the same cars, but with cosmetic differences.  The convoys start as an interesting activity, trying to replicate the feel of the chase sequences on the films, but unfortunately they fall flat after a while, since the experience is repeated over and over, though it gets easier when you get more tools at your disposal. Funnily enough, the closest I had to a chase sequence from the movies was in an optional 'wasteland mission', where you have to drive a big, slow truck with resources to a relatively far away point.  That felt a bit like the final chase from the Road Warrior, but not quite the same, obviously.  Apparently, if you reduce that area's danger level, there would be very few enemy encounters in that mission, which is an interesting detail, there were scripted pursuers AND ones drawn dynamically from the regular area spawns.   Enemy variety is kind of lacking. The factions each have similar archetypes. And the 'top dog' fights are unfortunately, not unique. All the top dogs behave the same, which gets fairly old. They are optional, but it would be neat if there were differences in them besides what comes in their arenas.   The strongholds and bases are quite fun to explore, often having far more going underground than what you can immediately see above ground, they feel like puzzle platformers at times.   The game is by far the prettiest of the open world games I have played. Which makes the use of the picture mode (shared with Shadow of Mordor) a VERY welcome addition. Both are ridiculous eye candy and worth absorbing.  The main story itself feels fairly aimless at first, but the set of endgame missions are ramping in intensity greatly, they are honed to a point. It ends with both a bang and a whimper, but be warned, this is Mad Max. This is not Road Warrior. This is not Beyond Thunderdome (even though it has a tacked-on thunderdome), and even though it looks a bit like Fury Road, this is not Fury Road at all. The tone and pacing is more like the original than anything else. And it manages to hit almost as hard as that one did.  Maybe even more so, because of the interactive nature of games.  There are many things that could have been better done, but for what it is, it is an amazing ride. If you have a chance to play it, do so. It might surprise you.",

            "review_text": "After taking my time and completing the entire story of the game along with so many of the side missions, I can safely say that this is not a bad game and it is worth the purchase. However, I don't recommend it at full price.  - The AI is very basic and very predictable, all of them are the same (including boss fights). So as soon as you learn the technique, you'll rarely ever get hurt from them throughout the entire game. - In terms of gameplay, you see everything there is to see within a few hours of playtime, aside from main story stuff. - Story isn't long at all if you remove all the filler missions they force you to take. - While the layouts of each camp are more or less different, the mission objectives of each camp are always the same. - You're apparently the only good guy driving around in the wasteland, everyone else is either bad or a straggler with info / side quest or beggar. - Your car is apparently a ticking time bomb whenever it's broken and if you don't get out within 5 seconds, it explodes, but if you do get out, your helper just fixes it back up and you can continue on your way... that is if the enemy that put you in that state don't just constantly run you over and not allow you any chance of dodging them since Max is ridiculously slow at getting back up and moving again once injured. - The NPCs in the game are so very afraid of the Sand Dunes area and always hype up the area to be extremely dangerous, yet it's much safer to hang out there than anywhere else in the entire game. Even the missions in that area are really easy.  - Giving beggars some water seems to have zero effect to the game at all... even running them over with the car has no effect either. What's the point of having them in the game?  - Apparently you're the only person that can save the world... or do anything at all in the game. Way worse than other games. - There is at least 1 known game breaking bug. There's a door that cannot be opened in one of the camps. You either have to do an extremely difficult stunt with your car in order to have a chance at shooting the oil pumps or you have to resort to cheating. For the record, I did the stunt. - Extreme weather events look awesome! But at the same time, they're stupid and they ruin the immersion of the game. By that I mean, the very second you go indoors, the weather effects go away, but if you stay outside and try to wait it out, it'll stay there forever (unless you drive through it). So if you trying to complete a mission and there's no way to go indoors, then you're probably going to die from it. I've also seen glitches where the weather effects continue happening deep underground. - Overall, I didn't feel like the game was challenging enough. The only time the game was challenging was usually due to the limitation of the game's mechanics or they just buried you in enemies hoping that will add some challenge. - I hated the ending too. It felt so rushed to the point where it just irritated the hell out of me.   I don't even care that certain individuals died in the game even though I liked them... it's just how they died and how they rushed it all to happen so quickly.   The story was only starting to get good and interesting and then wham! Stuff happens and the end, all within 20 minutes (that mostly includes actual gameplay, story is maybe 3 minutes?). But then, after the credits,   you go back to your destroyed car and see ppl that should be dead but aren't... all as though nothing had happened.   Talk about breaking immersion.   There's probably many more issues I didn't like about the game, but you get the point. And yet I still recommend the game... on a good sale price, which is what I paid for it. The graphics are nice and run smoothly. The overall game isn't frustrating enough to get me to stop playing it. It's almost like playing something like Euro Truck Simulator... there's really no point to playing it, but you do anyways cuz it kills a lot of time and you don't mind spending that time on it. I doubt I'll ever play the game from start to finish all over again though.",

The game starts with a roar and ends with the gamer wondering if doing it again is worth it.  The  story  (which is a pretty interesting one to say the least) revolves around the gamer playing as Max, a man scavenging the desert wastelands. As you progress through the game, you unlock upgrades for your car and perform different missions for various warlords. Max does this in hope of getting to gastown, a town filled with all the guzzoline (not gasoline) one could wish for. Unfortunately, the whole wasteland is overrun by Scrotus's War Boys. Max has to clear out their camps to get rid of the threat in different areas.  The  gameplay  is simple but has it's moments of fun. There are only two buttons required for combat : parry and strike. While it is simple, clearing out 10 to 15 guys in a in a camp is satisfying until it starts becoming redundant. Additionally while engaging in combat, cans of gas can be lit on fire to blow up enemies and shotguns can be used to get enemies at a distance. The driving part is fun due to it's simplicity but isn't as action packed as clearing a camp The driving controls are your basic right trigger to accelerate and joystick to control the wheels. The car has the ability to ram into others with a simple tap of the button. The car, the Magnum Opus is very customizable. The areas that of the car such as engine (transmission), body armor and thunder poons, which is the coolest weapon. Additionally, players can acquire cool hood ornaments that give the car upgrades. To take down enemies in towers, sniper rifles and harpoons can be used for extreme distances. There are many ways to keep entertained when roaming around, you may clear out scarecrows, scavenge war boy locations, and (of course) clear out gas camps.   Graphics  and  sounds  are also well done in this game. If your car takes damage, it's very apparent. Max will be bruised up and walk with a limp if he falls a certain distance. Your car can also go up in flames if you damage it too much. There is a neat visual feature in which Max's hair becomes longer over the course of the game. Max himself is also customizable. The sand looks very clean as do all the enemies. (When you bump into rocks or drive through a large pool of sand, the environment will react to you. There is a huge variation in the Scrotus War Boys compared to the many enemies that appear very different. The camps also look amazing. Many details are put into secret entrances into the camps so it is difficult to find the small opening you need to get in. The progression through camps is also what makes them special. Many small details go into making the huge world look clear to the human eyes. The water and sand look like they should but they vary in their appearance depending on which region Max is in. The enemies make noises when they fall off ledges and get hit. The sound is clear and grunts are well heard. Max seems to be in an active environment at all times.  The story line/campaign could have been better but seems to be the high light of the game. As I've said, it becomes repetitive : go collect or defeat this warlord can lose its grace after a while. Clearing out minefields and scarecrows can easily become tedious (and booooring). Also, when you have to drive across the map for sulphur, that's enough to drive anyone crazy. The game is good but has the potential to be a lot better. Following missions and clearing out camps can keep only keep you busy and entertained to a certain extent. All in all, this is a decent game. If you enjoy driving around in a free world like GTA and a bit of action raiding camps, this will appeal to you. It seems everyone I talk to either quit this game after 2 hours or kept playing it. It truly is a game in which I feel anyone can pick up and learn to play easily within an hour (which isn't always necessarily bad)!   I will recommend this game but with extreme caution. If one of your friends has this and their sharing this game with you, better to play it that way!

            "review_text": "ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF THIS YEAR --- DEFINITELY A CONTENDER FOR GOTY  I wasn't expecting much of Mad Max before the release but I was blown away when I played the game.   I'll start off by praising the developers for the perfection that they've put into optimization of this game. I hardly notice any frame drop, it runs at constat 60 fps on maxed settings @ 1080p.   You wouldn't exepct much from a wasteland in terms of versatality but this game is unbelieveably dynamic. I mean going from town to town, you'd see the environment changing big time. Every town is different than the other in many ways. While playing this game, you'd never feel like you're stuck in same cliched location.  What makes this beautiful game even more beautiful is the awesomely implemented, better version of Batman style hand to hand combat with lots of upgrades to keep the game fresh till the very end.  Chumbucket's engineered Mangum Opus (Oh saint, the angel cumbustion wants you to drive it) So probably ya'll know that this game offers great deal of cars combat but on top of that you have this one main car, called The Magnum Opus, It offers soo many different upgrades that even when you finish the game, you still wouldn't be able to have unlocked all the upgrades. You can modify the car in many different ways, whether it be in terms of its appearance or its performance.  Story - I still haven't finished the game, I've been doing side quests mainly because I don't wanna finish it fast but thus far, the story has been progressing nicely and it's quite engaging.   I'd totally recommend this game to everyone.",

            "review_text": "So here we have it. Mad Max. Id never seen the movies until I bought this game and playing it made me watch Mad Max 1 and 2 tonight. I didn't even know about this game until a friend mentioned he was quite hyped close to release. I waited until after release to buy it actually due to the 'wonderful' launch of Arkham Knight (sarcasm). But in all seriousness this game has slapped me in the face and proven me wrong.   I have enjoyed 37 hours of Mad Max so far and I have not enjoyed a game this much since one of the Assassins Creed games which im not going to go in detail about as I am not here to promote AC. Every new title that comes out nowadays gets me worrying about optimization and whether the game will actually be in any way playable at launch. Mad Max is 100% playable and 99.9% bug free. A 2MB update could fix the only issues the game currently has and the best part is that the bugs aren't game breaking! The gameplay is extremely fun all the way through and even though im a guy im not afraid to admit that the main story has some emotion in it. There were moments that I actually gasped in shock lol. The driving is very smooth and I would compare it alot to GTA's style of driving but it feels like driving the Batmobile from Arkham Knight quite a bit when it comes to vehicle control and drifting etc. The vehicle customisation is great. You can change every little piece of your car to your liking but it comes at a price of course. Combat. Once again very like Warner Bros Batman Arkham combat although you do notice the difference in moves and overall let's say 'gore'? Yeah gore. So ive actually completed the main story now and I was worried that when it is done will I still play Mad Max? Yes is the answer. The main story may be complete but still I had only 43% completed the game. It was beautfiul in it's own way. When it comes to character customization I would choose the word endless. You can change Max's facial hair, his head gear, wrist armor, jacket, gun and unlock new fighting moves. So after watching the first 2 Mad Max movies I would compare the game to Mad Max 2 the most. I was watching the very long car battle near the end and right away I was getting flashbacks of vehicle combat in the video game! Even the map/scenery makes me feel like im a part of the 2nd movie.   Most interesting feature of the game:  Chumbucket. This is a character you meet in the game. After meeting him he leeches onto you and never goes away. After 45 minutes of playing you are very thankful to have him there. 3000 pieces of scrap later you are extremely happy to have him with you because your car will begin to look beautful because of him. He is very helpful throughout the game and got me through some situations. Ive usually found that having a character like this who constantly is with you in a game gets annoying. It's like Roman from GTA IV. 'Hey Nico! Want to bowling?'. I know Roman wasn't physically there but he still got me trying to find subways so I could escape the world of phone signal. Although Chumbucket knows what he is doing. He knows when to speak and when to shut the hell up. That's always a great thing. Right?  Sooooo graphics! Beautiful! Some may shoot me virtually for this but im gonna compare this game to the Arkham Knight graphics. I know ive compared it to Batman enough but seriously it is the best and most accurate example and it's by Warner Bros for god sake! Honestly the graphics are great. The game is very well optimized and im extremely shocked that it is due to more recent games and their examples. Warner Bros have done a great job at recreating the Mad Max world for us to free roam around in with our rumbling V8 engines. Good job. And yeah here is the gretaest part of all for people worrying if they can run this game. Im using an AMD Radeon HD 7870 with an AMD FX 6350 on high 1920x1080. No stutters no lag and 30fps+.  Also on the main menu I see a DLC tab. The excitement is real and the wallet is open!  9/10",

            "review_text": "Its actually the first time ever I take the time to review a game. I never had much to do with the Mad Max franchise until I saw Fury road and I was immediately sooked and almost made a salto when i heard of a standalone game instead of a crappy movie adaption for the franchise as I love cars, explosions and desert wasteland settings.  Technical aspect:   ♥♥♥♥ this game runs smooth, SHINY AND CHROME . Its been a long time since i have seen a so perfectly fine optimized game. I run an i7 4770k @ 4,5 Ghz CPU and a Nvidia Gforce 670 GTX and the game runs on ultra settings like a charm on a very very stable 60 fps. I only had minor camera bugs, like the camera trying as hard as it can to focus on something your pulling after you with the harpoon, but thats more a programming thing than a grapical bug.  9,5/10   Story:  the story needs some time to get going and as im at like 20% of the game ( yes i like exploring) i havent seen much of it- however the game takes its time to introduce you into the characters, story and wasteland as much as it rushes you into the customisation and missionobjectives- overall that makes a good balance to me as the objectives are fast paced and short, rough fun but the story promises to take a deeper breath and contrasts well with the overall pace. However the story builds up more with the questions that are not asked rather than with those asked- the game gives plenty of hints if you are willing to observe characters and the world as to what happened, why people are the way they are and how everything went to ♥♥♥♥- the brainchild you are producing while driving through endless dunes, seeing oiltankers and airplanes alike inbetween dried salty coral reefs and giant chasms is a sight to ponder and behold.  8/10  Gameplay:  As most people already delved into the way the game plays ill just quickly summarize it:  batman like hand to hand combat with powerful combos and finishers , but not as deep as one would like to wish... well what do you expect of a wastelander- meaty fistfights and crude mean weapons. The game doesnt do much in that regard but it does everything right that it attempts. the animations are fluid and dont evoke a repetitive sense as the enemies are plenty.  Stronghold invasions can be done the mad max style or the mad max style- one way or the other you will make stuff explode, fall down and die- here and there are some sneaky bits if you dont want to bother trying to rip down a fortresses defenses but eventiually things will explode.  Exploration is immensely fun, one would think a wasteland is hard to make feel alive but every time i started to get bored with the environment i got something new to look at and behold thrown at me. The game strikes a perfect balance of wasteland and living world to me and you can always spot a lovingly handcrafted wreckage or sightseeing spot around the next corner. (dont look too close tough- sometimes the graphics designers got a little bit lazy with the textures)  The survival aspect does get a mention but is rather something that adds a little athmospere than anything truly survival-esque -- youll never have to really bother about water, food and gas but its just a nice immersive aspect to take care of these things- i rather eat maggots and the occasional lizard that eating one medpack after the other and never actually drinking ( lookign at you tombrider) It just fits into the game and the developer noticed its a smart move to just immerse you a little bit more  scavenging is a good balance between exploring and reward- sometimes it gets a slight bit frustrating given the low rewards , but youll find story sniplets and nice vantage points ever so often- and overall the game isnt so littered with collectibles that you lose interest in picking them up at some point *cough far cry cough*  Cars:  now here lies the fun- the customization options are fun and plenty, you actually have noticeable impact on the behaviour and playstyle of your car when you modify it- its an actual second character- Drawing a line to assassins creed black flag here- in Assassins creed the ship felt like a static thing to me that i would just upgrade- the magnum opus however has its characterchange for every addition or substraction you make and that brings a lot of diversity and fun- if you get bored with your heavily armored boulder of a car- how about ripping all those armor plates and bumpers off to create a fast and furious but very squishy dune racer? You can even do this on the fly so you never have to enter a situation unprepared ( even tough i would rather have the garage only accessible in the safe havens- yet i understand that would hinder gameplay a lot, given the constantly changing world and objectives- so i understand the descision to make the garage acceccible at all times)  car combat is everything michael bay has to offer and it feels like the movies. Its fast, unfogiving and lots of metal will fly through the air.   Shiny and Chrome factor 9/10  Verdict:  you like desert wastelands, survival, cars ,explosions and mutated people ? get the game, its definitely one of the best releases 2015   9/10",

There's two strikes, but guess what.... it works!  Mad Max the game captures the spirit of the traditional Mad Max movies, and blends them well with the current Fury Road movie as well.  An easy game to get into, a little 'console' in nature, it's just a fun way to spend an hour or two. No overt brain power required, just a good bit of escapism.  Pros:  Runs well on moderate systems. Accessible and simple to learn. Atmospheric. I feel parched everytime I play! Graphics ( esp burning cars ) is VERY well done. Scenery is excellent on PC.  Cons:  A little repetitive ( but you can streamline and concentrate on the story line ) GasTown not as imposing as was elluded to in the movies and lore. Feels underpopulated, protected and generally underwhelming.  Knit Picking Side Notes:  For those who do not know or even remember such a thing as Aussie Slang.... Dinkie Dye ( yes, pronounced Die, not DEE as done in the game ) means 'The Real Thing' 'The Genuine Article' 'Not fake or artificial' 'The Real McCoy' 'The Real Deal'. You get my drift. I'm assuming that Chumbucket pronounces it 'Dinkie DEE' because he never went to finishing school, and not because Americans have no clue on how to pronounce 'Australian'. I tell myself this because to miss pronounce it otherwise through ignorance would make this a 2/10 game for me, instead of a 7/10.  Enjoy.",

My belated game of the year for 2015. Gameplay's simple but extremely satisfying, combined with amazing post-apocalyptic atmosphere. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!  One of the only games I've ever played that makes me want to 100% it. Despite the fact that this game has the 'Ubisoftian' style of open world design, it's not like Assassin's Creed or Batman, where the world is filled with absolutely mind-numbingly boring activities. You drive around and visit decrepit locations, loot and collect scraps while sightseeing, beat up people with a satisfying Batman-like combat, maintain and upgrade your vehicle, run errands for Warlords and learn more and more about both Max and how the world turned into a wasteland. Everything is fluid, you go from one simple and satisfying activity to another. Not like AC or Batman where half the activities are clunky, time consuming and boring. Need scrap to upgrade car, drive around, find a camp, beat people up, reduce enemy presence in the region, take their scrap, upgrade car, need more scrap to upgrade further, rinse, repeat. Perfect and simple.  One single unsatisfying thing exists in the game, which is disarming minefields. Gigantic speed-bump. Very annoying. But not at all mandatory, it just triggers my OCD if I leave them undone.  Nobody hates the Ubisoftian design more than me. Seriously, I didn't even like Assassin's Creed 4. But Mad Max shown me that it can be done well. And I have to re-state how amazingly well done the atmosphere is. I will keep the studio behind this game on my radar, because it takes true talent to take the idea of a 'desert' and flesh it out into such a complete, detailed world. It's actually way better than the movie (Fury Road) in that aspect. Fury Road was just a desert. In this game, you go through dried out seabeds, an uncovered volcano, abandoned highways, decrepit buildings, an airport buried in sand... It's beautiful.  There's a host of cons, which would absolutely destroy a lesser game, but the fact that I don't care about them here is a testament to how good this game's core gameplay is.   Pros: -A simplistic, Ubisoftian game design actually being executed well for once. -Near-perfect PC port. The only thing I can nitpick is that Anti-Aliasing is just a simple 'Yes' or 'No', despite there being many other highly customizable graphical settings. -Long, if you want to do everything. -Photo Mode allows you to pause the game and take pictures while noclipping. There's also a selection of post-processing you can apply before taking the picture. -Highly detailed atmosphere and game world. -Good voice acting. -Very satisfying action. Vehicular combat is powerful and explosive. Melee combat feel powerful and requires you to pay just enough attention to make it interesting. It plays just like Batman, but the amount of handholding is taken down by a strong notch, making you have to pay attention to your positioning and timing. The sound design also makes your hits feel much more satisfying than in the Batman games. -Style. Not sure what else to call it. There's a bunch of little things that make me feel good. Like the way Max behaves while interacting with the environment, being able to use the Harpoon for more things than you'd expect, the chest-mounted flashlight actually having it's uses, etc. etc.  Cons: -The cars cannot be flipped. I can think of several good reasons why they made this decision, that go beyond the simple idea of 'handholding', but overall it really takes away from the game. There's no risk to making bad jumps or driving through uneven terrain. In the end they should have found a way to make it work. It looks goofy, too. -There's no enemy variety, which holds a really big threat to the game's replay value, but not a fatal issue. Not to me, anyways. Even the bosses are all the same. -The game is overall on the easy side, so long as you pay attention. -The gotdamned minefields are so stupid, I swear to god. Play the game to see what I mean. It can't be put into words. A huge break in the action. -Max has a shotgun and there's enemy Snipers littered all over the world, yet gunplay is not actually a part of the game. Nobody else carries any fire arms. It would have been hard to implement firefights into the game, but I hope they consider it, if there's a sequel.  -The soundscaping could have used some more work. The NPC that rides along with you constantly calls out events that aren't actually happening. 'THERE IT IS! THE MIGHTY DUSTER!' he tells us, warning us of a mini-tornado that is nowhere to be seen. 'YONDER! A WAR PARTY!' but not a single enemy unit anywhere. -The races are really dumb. Might have been an unfinished aspect of the gameplay that they didn't have time to flesh out. Or maybe it's an unwritten law of the Ubisoftian game design that your open world game needs some side-activities that nobody in their right mind would ever consider entertaining. Still, they're somewhat engaging at least and fast paced enough to not be a huge negative. Not to mention optional.",

But I did like the game, you basicly have to survive in a Wasteland that I would call Australia. You fight on enemy's either on foot, but also battles between cars and try on the path upgrade your car to make it better.  What I like about the upgrading is that it's not your default +1 level armor upgrade, but it's about balancing stuff out so you create the ultimate beast, for example a better engine will decrease your handeling, so you add something to balance it all out.  I pretty much only used the base car with some pimping to make it beast offcourse, but the game offers you allot of different body types for your car so you can change it (named Archangels).  This game just has allot to offer and it can be repetive for people, but If it didn't have some of the same elements like taking over a Top Dog Camp then you would finish the game to early and get less value for your money.  You don't have to do all the side stuff you know.  Anyways I loved the game and played it for 46 hours then I had enough if you go for 100% it probally takes about 50 hours.",

            "review_text": "I went in not knowing what to expect. In my experience, movie games tend to be poorly made cash grabs, but I had heard good things about this one.   The leveling system is rather unique. Rather than being based on experience, quests or the like, you raise your legend rank by completing specific tasks, some of them repeatable. This in turn gives you 'tokens' which you can redeem with the enigmatic Griffa, who I am not entirely convinced isn't just one of Max's hallucinations. Now, how many tokens you can spend on any one aspect of Max's abilities is gated- a gate which increases as your olegend rank increases. While this does prevent you from just maxing out health right away, it also encourages you to spend tokens in other attributes- and you have to spend them all. Reaching the (heh) Max level is not that hard- by the end of the game, I was 84 levels over the 'max' level after I ground to around level 90 at the first stronghold. Not that you have to, but it does make the game significantly easier.   The Magnum Opus, well, she's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, once you get fully upgraded thunderpoons there is nothing in the game that can stand in your way. On the other hand, in order to have anything resembling decent handling you have to keep her relatively lightly armored. God forbid you want to do ramming attacks as well, although with thunderpoons, the stock harpoon, and a fully upgraded shotgun you won't really have need of those.   Strongholds... now there's a fun mechanic. Strongholds are safe havens which you can upgrade to give you various benefits, such as free ammo refills, water, a full tank of gas.... basically, everything you need. And the more you improve a stronghold, the more it improves visually as well- you can see the difference you are making as it gets more built-up. Getting all the pieces required to do so can be a bit of a pain, but the payoff is well worth it, and thankfully you can mark their locations on your map while you are in the stronghold.   The threat mechanic is two things: first, it determines how dangerous an area is by determining how many patrols there are, and second it acts to gate Magnum Opus upgrades. This is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand, scarecrows and snipers are easy to find, and you can find a number of them just by using the omnipresent balloons which are in every region. On the other hand, clearing camps can become frustrating if you cannot find the last objective to destroy, as these are not in any way marked on your map. Minefields are actually not that bad, though- their is a mechanic for finding them, and it has a good bit of range to it. And generally, clearing out the camps is fun. Convoys are generally meant for when you are highly upgraded- the early ones can be taken out by Max with a fully upgraded shotgun, but the later ones almost certainly need high-powered thunderpoons to do readily.   Now, the story... the wstory actually made me not like Max that much, but it fits; he's trying to survive, and trying to avoid becomming close to anyone. He is very single-mindely focused on his quest to cross the plains of silence, and to build a car that will let him do so. And he does not let anything or anyone get in the way. Could the story have been deeper? Almost certainly. But I do think the story was decent.      My conclusion? The game is fun, but as with any game, there are cons. But in my opinion, they do not outweigh the pros.",

            "review_text": "Very under rated game.  Most open world games lose my interest fast as they involve a lot of repeat content. All those side activities and missions end up feeling indentical after you have done a few. I figured madmax would be the same. I was pleasantly surprised when I started noticing how each little side area and objective were not only hand crafted/designed to be different, but many had different mechanics from each other. No two warcamps are the same. Hell, even the balloon quick travel points are different and require a unique mechanic to complete (ie: one might require you to refuel the balloon, another has you driving your car around to remove the cables that are tieing it down).  The game feels very mad max. The world is closer to feeling like the newer film than the older (which is fine, I love all of them). Driving is a lot of fun, and the batman like combat is also fun. I enjoy the combat in this better than in batman for a few reasons. 1. The rage system - It makes combat that much more interesting than in batman. 2. Unlike batman, there are times when you realistically just cant counter an attack, even if you see it coming. If you are in the middle of grabbing some guy and breaking his neck, its just not realistic to think that you can suddenly counter another attack. Dont worry though, you can still counter 9 out of 10 attacks if your timing is good, but there is a bit more realism with the system than there is in Batman (where you will go flying accorss the screen no matter what you were doing, to counter an attack).  The amount of customization and upgrades in the game is pretty insane too. You have TONS of car options and upgrades, character upgrades, a skill/train system with upgrades, and a 'hideout' upgrade system that lets you build things in your base of operations. The car upgrades are by far the most impressive. The sheer number of things you can add and customize is great.  The voice acting is also top notch and very accurate with a Max film. The characters all have that no longer part of the reality we know behavior, much like the films.   The visuals in the game look very appealing too. Sure, its not super 4k ultra mega Alpha X resolution textures and special FX, but it still looks darn good. Not only that, it runs VERY well. Smooth framerates 99.9% of the time, plenty of video options to adjust. No complaints here, and im VERY picky about graphics and graphical options.  My ONLY 2 gripes about the game:  1. Getting enemies OFF your car is just a pain. Even after you put spikes all over your car, people will still jump on it. If you are low on shotgun ammo (which you are most of the game), you dont have an easy way to remove them. Smashing into another car sometimes does the trick, but if you dont have another car to smash into, then the best option, believe it or not... is to stop your car... AND GET OUT. WTF?? Really? It really breaks the whole 'high speed action car chase' if the best option is to stop and get out.   Id like them to add some more ways to remove enemies. Especially if they are on the driver side. Let Max reach out and punch or pull them off the car. Maybe your hunchback can push them off? Maybe once you have spikes, it drains their life the longer they are on the car, until they die and fall off? Something more needs to be added. Its a minor gripe, but one that pops up every so often during car combat.  2. Climbing up on things. Imagine this situation. 2 cargo storage containers. Both the same size. One has a yellow marked metal bar on top, signifying that you can jump up, grab it, and pull yourself up. The other doesnt. Er... why cant I climb the other one? Worse yet, there are things that are only 3-4 feet high that you cant grab and pull yourself up to.   Thankfully, most of the game doesnt revovle around needing to get up on these things, but from an open world exploration, or even 'which path should i take' aspect, it can be kinda annoying.   Both of these things however dont take away from the games fun, or keep me from recommending it. The game is a blast to play and a visual feast for mad max fans.   The one thing id like to see from a DLC, would be a co-op play via the net. Would be super fun to do all the racing and car combat with another person by your side. (doubt that will happen though)",

The game is very immersive, visceral, and brutal. There are a good amount of supplies available so it does a good job of making you feel like your in a wasteland without being annoying. The hand to hand combat to me feels like a mash up of Batman and Shadows of Mordor and the car combat is amazing. The progression system feels meaningful, the graphics are superb, the weather system is like another enemy (especially the storms), the voice acting was done well, and the story is engaging.  Cons:  1. The boss fights can become a bit repetitive due to a lack of diversity of NPC 2. Some of the side missions can become a bit repetative but no worse than taking outposts in FarCry 3 &amp; 4 and there is more variety than those games 3. Replay value didn't quite hit the mark for me, but you can continue to play after the main campaign and it took me about 80 hours to 100% so you'll get plenty out of it 4. The main campaign is a bit short but the difficulty level is designed to encourage you to play a lot of the side mission in between to properly level up. So if you don't try to plow through the campaign you won't really notice this issue.  Overall, I definitely recommend this game.",

Travel from one objective to another. I'll destroy this convoy, I'll blow up this scarecrow, I'll go to this location and pickup the collectibles. Do this repeatedly, this is Mad Max.   The story is decent, but short and few inbetween it's roughly 30 hours of playtime (50 for avid completionists).  The combat is similar to the Batman Arkham series so it's enjoyable enough.  Driving: The car mechanics are poor and clunky; it's overall quite bad. The main enjoyment comes from upgrading both the car and Max, adding stronger attack/defence, weapon capabilities etc.  The environments are bland and filled with nothing most of the time. Sometimes it's pretty to stop at certain locations and admire the sun setting or some mountains in the distance, but the majority of the time there's nothing, just sand and more sand.   Overall the game is fun, yet contains heaps of tedious collectibles and does nothing new to push the open world genre forward. I'd say look into it, if you've exhausted better open world games before it.",

It has a plot, that starts Mad Max-like but by the middle of the plot, it's gone completely convoluted, trajic mess that I feel was the worst part of the game.  It starts out very Mad Max like but the plot turns out more like a detour from Max's normal mundane life to be the driver of a super-car. It doesn't start that way, but with the help of his 'bud' for most the game, a mechanic called Chumbucket, it doesn't take long to become a rolling death machine.

            "review_text": "This is a tough one...  Let me start with a few points :   It is a great open world game!   It is sort of repetetive and somewhat forces you to do the same things over and over (not as often to ♥♥♥♥ you off but to get you bored)   takes around 20 hours to complete when you are not focusing on completing it   Not comparable to the movie( I know they are not at all related but I want to make this point so people who expect it can rethink it)   Ammo or fuel are laughably available after a few hours into the game(seriously it's ridiculous you can waste it however you like)   about 65% on foot and 35% car time which could also be misinterpreted ( I for once thought of a 90% car ration when buying so I somewhat got disappointed)   The game is not really challenging. The bosses are laughably repetetive and easy and because car combat is always the same you are more likely to just be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off than actually feel beaten   Story did not really seem interesting(I have to point out that I don't care about story in any game but this one seemed very generic)   There was no story mission that took longer than ~15 min. which makes them seem unimportant   Now let me get to the point:    It is a good open world game   It is a mediocre car combat game but one of a kind  It has a lot of weaknesses mostly that it's repetetive. You can easiely compare this to Metal Gear Solid V. MGSV has almost always the same objective but offers many different approaches. Mad Max offers to slaughter everyone and everything either by blowing them up or beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of them which makes somewhat boring.  As I have stated I played 20.8h . If my playtime in this game grows by more than 5 hours I probably changed my mind but if not than I tell you this: After 20 hours I am done with the game. I unlocked pretty much everything and don't see a point in upgrading anything else since there is no challenge whatsoever in it anymore. Other than with Shadow of Mordor for example where it took me 24 hours to get to ~90% completion I am not really satisfied with the time I spent.   Do I recommend it? Yes!",

The above save (mine) sits at 99.3 hours total for anyone curious and the final achievement is... one that could take an hour or another ten heh.  Fun game, open world. Vehicle use feels like RAGE or Far Cry 4 with a masterpiece combat system. Grappeling hooks, thunderpoon(rocket launcher), nitrous, fully upgradeable vehicles, over fifty vehicles ingame btw.  On foot combat is melee focused, your only ranged weapon is your shotgun but ammunition limits plus overall use steers you towards melee combat which feels like any of the batman titles.  The story itself feels set aside all the way until the last 15% of the story play at which point it goes knee deep and becomes more engaging. Sadly though it dosent answer some popular questions amongst this franchises fanbase such as a, where is fury road timeline wise with the original trilogy and b, is this the original mad max or someone else and c, is he married before the game or during the game only.  Thankfully the story isnt the main focus of enjoyment. There are hundreds of places to explore/loot, vehicles to collect and upgrade, talent points, races, convoys to chase everywhere, strongholds to build, relics to collect, it rocks!  I walk away from this game now (until some sort of dlc of course) satisfied that I got my money's worth out of it. I'd like dlc, I'd like more lore depth explored, more non hostile groups out there in the wastes to encounter, more exploration in to ruins of the old world, there's lots of potential here. I have no hope that this game will match fallout 4 when it arrives but there is ALOT that can be done to this game to put it on a level near F4 when it hits in november :)",

To ask that there should be more is like saying the Cow Level exists in the Original Diablo game, it simply does not. The game is ALMOST perfect in every way it was designed. Keyword 'Almost'. Just remember Mad Max's universe is a cruel barren wasteland, and to expect an ocean of water in it is simply a laughing matter. Its an awesome game in my opinion.  The only 2 things that bothered me were   - the fact that Max had to 'help' people &amp; groups to progress, yeah thats kinda the main mechanic of the game, but having watched all the movies its kinda the opposite since he only helps just enough to get by and get his car back or take out those who messed with him. Its the only way to progress the story and unlock the map. Just a small pet peave of mine, it all worked as intended.   - The 2nd big thing for me was the Racing needs some balance. Its fun, but obnoxious at times, especially the barrel bash races.   On my first play through which is the nearly 125hours on record i have because i took my time and had fun scavenging the map for all the cars and parts, which also includes currently 28/29 Achievements, all but 1. The last is semi hard to get, but obtainable by anyone, its just tedious. Once you finish the games final chapter it allows you to roam the map and finish any loose ends, side quests, scavenging or ingame reward achievements to continue Leveling Max's reputation up. I think my Max is lv 140.",

I've played for a few hours and the balance of unlocking things with increased difficulaty is done extremely well. I find it consistently somewhat challenging at this early level and by that I mean I know there are places that I can go where I'll just die so I don't go to those places mostly.

The tools at your disposal include a shotgun, car-mounted sniper rifle, boomsticks, and Max's bare ♥♥♥♥ing fists. During your adventure, you will roam from stronghold to stronghold, capturing camps, killing the big baddie's Top Dogs, and just generally being a helpful guy. This is all well and good, and some of the coolest open world roaming I've ever experienced.  Then, you hit the last few missions, and ♥♥♥♥ gets real. I won't spoil anything, but the story breaches out of the rest of the game like a whale on Red Bull and stays there. It's a hell of a slap in the face, and I loved hating every second of it.  Bottom line: If you ever wanted to walk a few hundred miles and drive a few thousand more in Max's boots, this is the way to do it.

And blow stuff up, of course.   Big time.    And just imagine you can do all this in the most beautiful wasteland! Yeah, I mean it. It really feels remote and empty, but incredibly detailed at the same time. And even when some content may get a bit repetitive: there's really lot's of stuff to discover in nicely placed locations in a vast open world.  A game that idolizes, no, openly worships motor cars as true saviours in this harsh world. That makes fun of some roaring monster of a modified V6 engine, because it will forever be inferior to the most sacred V8 block. And the way, the vehicles are presented and used here, is so incredibly over the edge, that all those friggin 'don't try this, always wear your seatbelt' need for speed warnings don't even DARE to show up anytime on the screen. If Max had a seatbelt, he would rather fasten someone else   behind   his Magnum-Opus.  Car crashes have never been so aesthetic and satisfying. You can almost feel the flames! 11/10 Pyromaniacs AND skilled cameramen would recommend.  Only downside for some people may be, that in spite of it's awesome post-apocalyptic setting, this really isn't some kind of survival game. Even though food is rather scarce, you do just fine with your water canteen most of the time which is only used like a refillable med kit. No dehydration / hunger / bleeding whatsoever. Just refuel your car and take a sip of water from time to time.    Pros:      Easy combat and overall controls.    Blowing stuff up in incredible detail (even on slow machines, like...V6 engines).    Vehicular combat done right. Really nice driving physics and insane combat maneauvers at the same time. The cars really handle a lot different and you can feel the overall performance. AND: First Person driving. May be unwise in some combat situation, but the camera also does a decent job, when riding your wheels in third person.    No speed limits, no guardrails, just some paths for faster travel, but always the ability to go fully offroad and discover stuff on the way. (There are even fast travel locations but...b****, please. Who need's them anyways?)    Nice character upgrade system (which extents to your Magnum Opus Car, which is like a character itself and totally modifiable)    Lot's of stuff to do that keeps you busy.    Really catches the visual style of Fury Road.     Cons      Combat is fun but not that varied like Sleeping Dogs' for example.    Overall a bit too easy at the moment I write this. No difficulty settings. (22 hrs. of playing. You can boost Max' skills and his car quite fast, even though West Coast Customs wouldn't be proud of you. But why not tear through a fortress like a real man, without even a shirt on? Putin would be proud..)     Not really a Con for me, for this game really is fun, the way it is, but stuff like a Survival or Sneaking system might have made the experience even more interesting at certain points, but this one sticks to the action and facing the wasteland head-on, Mad Max style.   In my opinion, if you are not looking for a survival game but love postapocalyptic settings, fast and loud cars and a whole lot of explosions, this one is a must-have..  especially   when on discount like the moment I wrote this review.",

            "review_text": "Well, I do have to agree with almost every critique point people who don’t like this game bring up. Yes the missions and tasks are repetitive, yes it can be a humongous grind at times, and yes the story is a bit bland. But does it matter? Well, it depends. Sure, having more varied missions and tasks and a more compelling story would make this even better, but it’s not like the game is not enjoyable as is. I for one love just driving around the wasteland for hours, tearing down scarecrows, harpooning snipers from their towers, chasing after every enemy car I see or duke it out with a convoy. And I even enjoy the grind of looting every damn camp I find for minuscule amounts of scrap and ammo because it makes the world feel like it should: A harsh wasteland where resources are scarce and most of your time has to be spent on finding supplies to survive.   And surviving is not easy in the world of Mad Max. You don’t have insane amounts of health and armor, and enemies are plenty and dangerous. Your only way to heal is through water or food, both of which are incredibly rare and you’re sure to have none of both available when you most need it. I have spent quite some time just trying to find water. Of course, as you progress you can complete projects in the strongholds to provide you with all you need. But it takes quite some time to finish these (because you have to find the parts) and even after that, depending on how far out in the wastes you are, driving all the way back to the next stronghold just to fill up on water might not be all that appealing (unless you’re willing to use fast travel, which I’m not). Because the wasteland in Mad Max is freakin’ huge!   And it is also unbelievably beautiful. Avalanche really did an awesome job at providing the most beautiful wasteland possible. Despite it all being desert the terrain varies greatly between regions and is littered with ruins and awesome sights. The colors are just perfect, the textures and details gorgeous and the horizon always looks captivating. No matter where you look or where you look from, you just want to print out what you see, frame it and hang it on the wall. Best looking wasteland I’ve ever seen, both in games and movies!   Oh, and it has sandstorms, huge, monstrous, violent, end-of-the-world sandstorms that will rip you and your precious car to pieces! Best moments are when one of those is happening while in the middle of a convoy chase, that’s when things get really awesome! And it’s not just a weather effect that suddenly appears out of nowhere, oh no, you can see it coming on the horizon, and then you can either race ahead of it to the nearest friendly camp or stronghold to sit it out or take the risk and head right in to hunt for the loot the storm is carrying with it.  And it’s not just the landscape that looks gorgeous, the whole game looks absolutely fantastic. And it runs as smooth as silk on highest settings no problem if you have a halfway decent machine. I run it with a GTX 780Ti 3GB on 2560x1440 and didn’t have a stutter or freeze or anything. I haven’t checked the actual framerate, but from how it looks I’d say it must be around 50-60. Also so far no bugs and only a few minor glitches encountered and only one CTD in 30 hours. For a game that just came out and looks this stunning, this is really something.  And the combat? Well, the car combat is awesome, obviously. Especially when you take on a convoy which will start a battle that can last for minutes. Taking out the escorts one by one through various means like shooting their fuel tanks, harpooning parts off the cars or even the drivers out of them (which is exactly as hilarious as it sounds), exploding them with your thunderpoon (yes that’s really what it’s called) or just drive through them with your nitro boost and then going for the big price, the tanker. What do we need the movies for now? Why just watch it when you can start up your PC and do it yourself?  The only negative thing to mention here is that the car physics sometimes can break immersion a bit as they are quite unrealistic at times. It is almost impossible to flip the players car over and even then it will always land on its wheels. While I understand why it was programmed that way I still find it a bit off putting when I see my car magically level out midair. But that’s really just a minor thing. As long as you don’t get airborne physics are ok and make for some awesome crashes.  Also, taking down enemy camps is not as bland as some make it sound, at least not for me. I quite enjoy doing recon on them to find the weak spots in their defense and figure out the best approach to taking them down. And there are quite a few possibilities here. You can try to sneak in undetected, use the sniper rifle from a safe distance to kill everything you see, drive around the base and tear the defenses down with your harpoon or just storm in head on and hope for the best (and probably die in the process). It’s up to you, there isn’t a perfect way to do it, so you do whatever seems most fun to you. Now once you get into the camp is where things can get a bit annoying as swarms of enemies descend upon you while you struggle with the less than perfect melee combat controls. Mostly it’s just button mashing paired with hope. But once you get the hang of it and have your tactics down it can also be quite satisfying to break bones, smash in heads, finish someone off with a gutshot or just outright exploding someone with a thunderstick. Just don’t get stuck in a tight corner as this will completely mess up the camera!  A bit frustrating is the search for all the items you need to find or destroy to complete a camp 100%. Some are so well hidden that you can run several time through the entire camp without finding them. Or you find out you need the shotgun to destroy that last Scrotus insignia but you just run out of ammo. Bad luck, come back again when you have found some ammo… That’s actually a bit stupid. They should at least have put an ammo loot close to things you have to destroy with the shotgun, like they did with fuel cans next to things you have to blow up.  The progress system for Max and his car I think is well designed and balanced. It really requires you to do about everything that can be done in this game to finish all the challenges and unlock all the upgrades as opposed to games where you can just ignore huge chunks of the content and still max out. The pace is also just right, not to fast but also not frustrating. Yes it does require you to grind, especially to get all the scrap needed to actually buy the upgrades, but as I already said, I don’t mind the grind as it fits well with the scenario and is also quite fun to do at times.  As far as the scope of the game, I have played 30 hours so far and statistics say I have completed only 31% of it. So, I still have vast areas to explore and loot as well as many, many hours of insane road battles, violent explosions and bloody fights ahead of me. I’d say it is worth every cent I’ve spent on it.   To sum it up, I give it an 8 out of 10.  Pro:  + vast open desert world that’s harsh but incredibly varied and beautiful + insane, spectacular and highly enjoyable car combat + fantastic graphics and sounds + highly customizable car + good and well balanced progress system + very good and streamlined controls and camera while in car + car combat can be quite tactical at times  Con: - missions and tasks are repetitious - bland main story - some issues with melee combat controls and camera (especially in confined spaces) - unrealistic car physics sometimes break immersion  So, do I recommend it? Hell yeah! For me this is the best action game I have ever played, and I recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone who likes this type of game. Yes it has flaws, but I think I have pointed them out sufficiently. So it’s up to you to make up your own mind about it.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game on a whim. Although was expecting it and had seen pre-release material, I wasn't too hopeful, given movie tie-ins and was planning to wait reviews. After a weekend of a music-festival-turned-unplanned-Mad Max-cosplaying, I decided to buy the game, my face still covered in chrome spray.   Just like Fury Road to original three Mad Max films, this game follows its own continuity of sorts (although the ending suggests it might actually be a prequel to Fury Road).   First off, the game looks *amazing* and is incredibly well optimised to PC. This is a statement I had seen in reviews before I bought it and thought it was just people struggling to find compliments for a bad game ('Damned by Faint Praise') but it really looks good and runs very smooth. The distances show very well, there is little to no flickering, I have not encountered any obvious glitches. I had only one spot where the framerate dropped significantly. Flames and thunderstorms in particular look sublime.  Gameplay is fairly solid. Nothing too exciting if you have played AC or Batman, as elements of both are readily apparent. Controls are a bit off. Some of the default key mapping puts commands in odd places but you can re-map them. As a whole, the gameplay is fairly shallow. Most commands are reliant on holding the E button. Or mashing the E button. Or mashing the E button while mashing mouse keys if you're fighting. Controls are stable and it is fun to fistfight, use your gun, shiv or weapons. No real issues stick out.  Car controls vary but overall tend to lack handling, though nowhere as badly as the cars in Watch_Dogs did and they depend on the car you pick too. Still, without dedicated handbrake buttons and the like (though the vehicle slam button can substitute as one in some situations) the vehicle mechanics feel fairly shallow. Nitro boosts, harpoons and other abilities on the Magnum Opus make this a bit more enjoyable, almost to the expense of other vehicles. I honestly fail to see why you should even step in any other vehicles if Magnum as around. Given the abundance of interesting vehicles around, this is bit of a shame.  The pre-release material touted the game's survival element quite a bit. You would need to make sure you eat and drink to avoid starving/dehydrating and would be on the hunt for guzzoline like in the hunt for Mad Max: The Road Warrior. These never really come into play. You come across food (in the form of dog food cans with a reference to The Road Warrior, lizards and rats you can kill and eat or maggots on corpses) but they are all effectively static health pickups. There isn't a real hunger mechanic or picking up and hoarding food or spending hours in the wastes looking for it. Same with water. You can carry it in a canteen and it replenishes your health. Max will comment about thirst if canteen is empty but doesn't actually suffer for it. Most camps tend to have some gas canisters and locations where the gas is part of the objective they regenerate. Bullets are rarer and easier to run out and is effectively your only resource to keep an eye on. However if you fully upgrade allied camps, you will rarely be lacking resources.   Both Max and the Magnum Opus can be upgraded and customised, using scraps as resources. Most of the customisations improve abilities but some are purely cosmetic. Throughout the game, you also come across a wastelander called Griffa who has some cryptic conversations with Max, which lead to additional upgrades for Max's abilities. This allows for a degree of customisation and especially on-foot sections will challenge you even if you are fully upgraded. On vehicle, most of the fighting is fairly balanced, if prolonged. Once thundersticks are unlocked, they become a cakewalk.  Thoughout the game, there are many small camps/ as well as a number of bases belonging to Gastown. Most side missions involve taking these out for scraps, history relics, upgrades for friendly fortresses. Destroying Gastown bases also reduces the threat level in the region, reducing Gastown patrols and enabling you some of the upgrades. Taking all of these out can get a bit tedious and repetative. There are many camps that are just mooks + loot with nothing specific to flesh the world a bit more (other than some history relics). The more interesting places don't really appear until later in the game (especially in the Buzzard territories) and are still rare and in between. Most Gastown bases follow the same formula with no interesting sidequests (rescuing people for instance. There are many corpses in cages. Why can't some be alive to be rescued?) The %100 completion chase can sometimes kill any momentum, as the devs seem fond of showing how clever they are by putting things in really obscure spots. As a whole, this is the weakest part of the game and I enjoyed it a whole lot more once I got them out of the way. Outside these, there are the occasional wasteland encounters (mostly wastelanders with something to tell you and occasional questgivers with very simple quests) and a racing circuit that makes things a bit more interesting.   The setting and locations are a bit more interesting. As stated before, you play around the Wasteland surrounding Gastown and despite it being a desert wasteland, the creators went to some effort to make things varied. Jeet and Gutlash's territories used to be the ocean and there are plenty of reminders as you drive into a cave and notice all the dried corals or take shelter in grounded ships, giving a clear idea how messed up the world is. Heading inwards, you see go through old highways and abandoned towns. Eastwards, there are dunes which look empty but have a whole city that was buried beneath. Finally, the area around Gastown is a polluted wreck. So, kudos to to making the different locations a bit more varied. The history relics you collect give a sense of how things became the way they did and probably go into more detail about the nature of the apocalypse than any other Mad Max production so far. After a while, they don't say anything you didn't already know and could be a bit more detailed but are still a nice touch.   I initially didn't have much hopes of the story but it actually didn't turn too bad. As his is getting ready to travel to the Plains of Silence, Max is waylaid by Warlord Scarabus Scrotus (son of Immortan Joe, introduced in a Fury Road tie-in comic) and loses the Interceptor, gravely injuring the Warlord in the process. Max then comes across Chumbucket who is looking to create his own vehicle, the Magnum Opus. Believing Max to be a Saint of his strange religion, he enlists Max who only helps him looking after a new car. As they look to build it, they encounter settlements that have come under attack from the Warlord scouring the wasteland, gradually leading up to Gastown itself in pursuit of a V8 engine. The earlier parts of the story are fairly standard but as it develops, it goes more and more into Max's demons and his fears of attaching to people in fear of losing them just as he lost his Wife and child and these issues come pretty heavily later in the story. Between that and the optional encounters with Griffa, the game actually goes into a lot of detail regarding Max's solitude and survival guilt. Not going to spoil a lot more but there is a reason why I feel the game is a prequel leading up to Fury Road.  You won't find the charm and crazy-fun of Fury Road here. I doubt even the film sequels will have that. The characters aren't as memetic or memorable either, although the makers clearly tried to and Chum, Crow Dazzle and the Outcrier shine among the rest.  As a post-apocalypse game taking place in the Mad Max universe, this is a good, solid game that will keep you busy, so definitely buy it, though you may want to wait for a discount if you have doubts. I almost regretted a Day 1 purchase but it grew on me as I progressed, so I am glad I bought it then.",

You can also use any other car you find in the game, but sadly no bikes or war rigs. This is only singleplayer, however you can compare race times with friends. On-foot gameplay is in third-person, but there is the (suicidal) option to use first-person while driving. Vehicle combat feels great! Fast-paced and intense like in a movie. and the on-foot combat looks and feels just as brutal and intense! There are a few bugs like occasionally having the cursor stick around after being in the menu which can be easily fixed by quickly opening and closing the menu; another is very rarely (twice in 92 hours for me) being stuck in the menu, where I would have to turn off the game. This wasn't a big problem though since the game frequently autosaves. I've heard complaints about the game feeling repetitive, which I guess just depends on the person because I never got tired of exploding cars, chases, shooting, looting, surviving storms, and just exploring. Plus a great bit of story if you're an interested Mad Max fan. Definitely worth the Steam price, though you can find it for much less on other sites like I did :) Would recommend anyday!",

(Immortan Joe's Son) You must seek revenge on this murderous warlord but on the way meet some interesting allie and characters.    Pros Amazing battles in car and on foot Interesting and beautifully made wasteland and atmosphere Upgrading youself and car is rewarding and fun Never seem to get bored of driving around battling insane Scrotus War Boys or red eyed Raven men at night.  Cons A bit glitchy at times Doesn't exactly get the mad maxian feel Main quests can get a little bit repetitive but all in all doesnt really effect much The hyper realism they tried to get in the game did not work. The game is not very logical or realistic at times  Conclusion Mad Max hardly ever gets boring in battles and its endless fun blasting warboys with shotguns, to ramming them off cliffs or just harpooning them in the face. ( For people who hate endless action and find it boring am one of those people most of the time but I find this extremely fun with its unique road combat ) The wasteland is amazing to look at an never just empty dunes. The game does glitch sometimes from graphical errors to cars disapearing. If you are coming into it a fan of Mad Max think of it more as based of the movies. It doesn't really get the feel of Mad Max but if you think of it as a independant game more than complete mad max it is amazing. 9/10",

No bugs to speak of, fluid ground combat, good car mechanics (in the open, anyway), good atmospherics. I had nothing bad to say about this game... until the Gastwon Race. This is a story mission that basically locks off the V8 engine and all further story advancement if you cannot complete it.   And I cannot.   It's not a matter of trying again or trying with a different configuration of car components. I've tried and tried, and I've read online guides (such as they are) and the bottom line is that this beautiful, fun game ~ruined~ its reputation with me because of this one, required, mission for which there is precious little precedent. The death races, the most similar mission, are wide open. Racing in the confines of the Gastown track is an entirely different experience.  I would have liked to have seen the ~rest~ of the game, but this one mission that I cannot beat has pretty much bricked the game for me. I got the game on sale, which is the only way I can advocate getting it, now. And at that, I would urge people to enjoy the game ~while you can~ because that Gastown Race would infuriate a pope.",

The melee fighting has you punching light or heavy attacks as well as being able to shoot the shotgun and stab with the shiv. How about being able to throw that shiv, to stealth inside and sabotage some things before assaulting. Things like that.  Strongholds themselves are surprisingly lifeless. No one moves around, it's basically a garage with an added space to it. Sure it evolves as you upgrade things, it adds some cosmetics. It would have been more fun if a stronghold actually was a settlement too, where you see NPC's doing their wasteland businesses.  It has a lot of fun elements, that could have been more fun if they had added some more functionality to it. Overall, it's a very fun game, but it wears off the longer you play it due to the extreme repetition. Storywise, it's more of a guide through the game and you don't really have anything to say about it. So, don't expect any deeper RPG functionalities.  Final words; Having said all the above, the game itself is really, really fun. It feels like a Batman (light) game set in the Mad Max 'universe'.",

You can customize Max as well, mostly in terms of linear upgrades &amp; abilities, but these all add new cosmetic changes to Max along with being able to customize his beard &amp; hair.  The world has a great size, with lots of little things to do in it. Side quests, upgrades for you, your car, and civilian settlements, along with finding water &amp; fuel to stay alive and stay driving. In terms of graphics, it all looks very nice. Heatwaves over the horizon, &amp; explosions that look great.  The on foot gameplay is good too. You can fist fight enemies very similar in style to the Batman Arkham games, &amp; you can pick up weapons to do special moves and do more damage. You block, parry, and eventually get into 'fury mode' I think it's called, which lets you break through enemy blocking &amp; do more damage along with special finisher moves. If you have the ammo, you can always just shoot your way out of a melee combat situation since you have your trusty shotgun at all times, along with some other gadgets.  This game is pretty well done, &amp; is a great representation of the Mad Max universe in game form. It's not perfect, &amp; there are plenty of silly, weird, and unrealistic things in this game, but Mad Max was never known to be without all that. I definitely recommend.",

The customization is good enough, the car battles are fun, and driving around the desert may be more a challenge then expected, but that is enjoyable as well. The fights on foot are also really fun, and become really challenging. It's a simple formula, but one that is used well. All in all, this game is well worth having in a collection, especially if you love the idea of free roaming, no rules, and amassing enough power to become a total boss. The rush off speeding down the road, spotting an enemy car heading in your direction, and just ramming him head on, tearing right through him in a huge explosion. That alone was worth $10.

            "review_text": "Mad Max is a third person (with and option for first person in car), open-world, single player game. Gameplay focuses on action and exploration, both on foot and in car.  The biggest thing Mad Max has going for it is the world. Avalanche Studios have crafted a wasteland that feels seamless, alive, and genuine while still maintaining faithful to the source material of the movies. This game is in fact treated as a prequel to the movie 'Fury Road'. For all the violence and terrible things that happen in this place of squalor it is almost always shockingly beautiful to look at. The map is absolutely giant and filled with different things to do.  With the help of your sidekick, Chum Bucket, your journey revolves around finding scrap to build your car, 'The Magnum Opus' into the perfect road warrior machine. Chum Bucket is probably my favorite video game sidekick. He was always entertaining, particularly when he starts spouting lines about his crazy religion and praying to his angel of combustion. If you have an understanding of mechanics and car parts there is a lot to enjoy here and will enhance your experience. Your car, The Magnum Opus, feels like a character itself and the more you build it the more you will get attached to it. I'm not sure if that was intentional game design or not but I thought it was really cool that it happened to me because that's how most characters in the game world are. They worship all things mechanical and are attached to their rides.  In addition to collecting scrap through exploration, combat is other core pillar of this title. Combat is split pretty evenly between on foot and in car. On foot, the game uses the Arkham Style fist fighting that you know and love. No complaints here. Its fun and rewarding. My favorite though is the car combat. I can't think of another title that delivers on this more. It's exciting, and at times even heart pounding. This is where you actually get to feel like Max from the movies. It's incredibly cinematic when you take on a convoy in first person view.  The game also offers a photo mode that you can activate at almost any time. Its a great addition and I used it often, given how beautiful the game is. I wish every game had an option like this.  The game isn't without it's shortfalls though. The main story is extremely short and underwhelming. I feel like you could complete it in under 8 hours. In contrast, if your're a completionist you can easily spend 50 hours in one play through. To me, that's a little unbalanced. Just like other reviewers have said all the filler here can become repetitive. For me though, it was more cathartic than anything. I was just so enraptured by the game world and loved exploring every nook and cranny to get my precious scrap.  In my opinion, the biggest offense here are the missed opportunities. You never get to drive a huge war rig in anger. And there's never a giant chase scene that lives up to the ones in the movies. And most disappointingly, 'The Big Nothing' (the maps boundary), never panned out the way the developers said it would. They said it would be a kind of procedurally generated area that would have high risk, high reward exploration that you could drive around in for hours. In an interview with GamingBolt, senior producer John Fuller said, 'There are no finite limits to the map… in other words, there is no ‘one side’. You can continue driving into The Big Nothing until you get bored or killed.' Sadly, none of this is the case. It's simply not in the game. If you enter The Big Nothing you will see an onscreen message that tells you to turn back. If you don't, you are killed and your last checkpoint is loaded. I couldn't find any developer comments online as to why this feature was dropped but it was something I was really excited about.  All in all, Mad Max has been some of the most fun I've had this year in games. Ever since I saw 'The Road Warrior' as a kid, I've been drawn to the Mad Max universe. This game let me become Max and live in the wasteland. It was an amazing experience for me.  TL;DR: A must play for fans of the franchise and a safe bet for anyone else.",

Then the main missions themselves.. they were short. I thought there would be more to the story, but I'll get back to this after. I realized (correct me if I'm wrong) this game was based before the movie? due to the movie having flash backs of Max letting the mother and daughter die? which means there will be a sequel or two. What upsets me is the ending, both mother and daughter die and so does Chumbucket. I wish we could have a choice to either save one of them (chumbucket) Still was hoping there would be more to the story, sidequests are good though but it feels weird playing after i know Chum dies.",

            "review_text": "A lot of people call this 'Open World Game: The Open World Game'. A lot of people will hate on this because it does nothing especially new with the open world genre, or close combat fighting systems, given that the fighting is basically completley cribbed off Batman: Arkham Location's fighting system pretty much.  Personally I don't think these people are wrong, but they are focusing far too much on that. When it gets down to it, Mad Max is a very capable, very good open world game. There's lots of sidequests and things to do, taking out camps is a lot of fun, clearing out convoys, upgrading strongholds, upgrading the car and Max's equipment and max himself are great fun, the scavenger hunt for history relics is actually really interesting and really does enrich the world and setting...  There's a good deal of great characters used remarkably well too, though the scant female presence in the game is relegated to 'current necessary 'move the plot forward' key', 'damsel in distress who could have been way more badass but in the end is merely a mcguffin for the story' and 'cute kid you see almost nothing of'. This is a little bit of a shame, but ultimately doesn't detract too much from the game's story.  Speaking of, I personally feel that the game's story is exceptionally well done. It's really well shot and acted, the graphics are fantastic and even when you aren't playing on full graphics with everything turned on it still looks great (apart from shadows feeling a little shonky at times). The cars drive well, the missions are great fun, and the story plays out wonderfully.  Hhhoooweeeverr... I do have one pressing issue. I am a big fan of all four Mad Max films. I actually have gained a new appreciation for even Beyond Thunderdome, despite how cheesy it is at times and how it devolves into Peter Pan: Wasteland Edition at the end. In all but the first one, Max isn't really the main character. He's not the character the story is really about. He is an observer to, a reluctant participant in, and essentially the mcguffin OF the storyline. The Road Warrior is more about a group of escaping survivors and their plan to be free of their pursuers. Thunderdome is about the rise and fall of Auntie Entity. Fury Road is about the rebellion of and eventual rise to power of Imperator Furiosa through brutal conquest. In all three of those, Max is simply (to steal a line from HL2), 'the right man in the wrong place'.  I suppose when it comes down to it, the game is more of a call back to the first film, where the story is rather squarely centralised around him, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It does feel a little like it's lacking somehow as a result, but honestly if you see it as a prequel to Fury Road, it does work rather surprisingly well, and the way it's all executed really grants a lot of depth to Max and his madness. There's lots of subtle details here and there, lots of tidbits of details that let you fill in the gaps on your own without you being left scratching your head in confusion.  Gameplay of course is pretty much rock solid, driving works great, fighting is visceral and brutal and very kinetic, and there's a lot to keep you busy. However I did find myself at certain points going through sidequests just so I could fully upgrade the car and wishing, wishing I didn't have to deal wth certain things. I imagine if you just went for the main plotline, the game would be over fairly quickly. I'd guess I spent the majority of my hours doing sidequests, exploring scavenging locations, building projects in strongholds and just bumming around doing stupid crap in the wastes, but I still had fun for the most part.  It does everything right for an Open World game, but it excels at very little. Nevertheless its story is definately worth experiencing and the game is really well done. Very, very, VERY few faults, and an exceptional port for PC.  Worth picking up, definately.",

It shares many of the great features of Shadow of Mordor, but also brings enough of its own ideas to be a worthwile addition. It took me a little while (perhaps a few hours) to find my momentum, largely due to the strange hand-holding the game foisters on you to start with. However, once I was free to head off into the Great White and start having my own adventures I soon fell in love with it.  If you enjoy sandbox style adventure games then this is a great purchase and will give you hours of fun. It's not a story game in the way that GTA or Assassin's Creed is, so do be aware of that. But take it on its own merits and it's a wonderful game that is unique enough to warrant a place in almost anyone's library.",

            "review_text": "VERY enjoyable game! (mostly)  First of all let me point out what is awesome about this game. Atmosphere! Oh! The atmosphere! If the movies did it well, then so too has this game captured the bleak-yet-beautiful nature of the wasteland. The skies, the weather, the STORMS!  The great addictiveness of Mad Max is perfectly executed in 3 things: 1) The development of your car - the Magnum Opus (a wasteland mistransaltion of the Greek - Magna Opus - Great Work of Magnificence) 2) The development of stronghold projects for benefits - every project is a mission and every project is a reward. 3) Collection of vehicles - who needs cards these days when you can collect cars?  Summary of things I loved: The majetsy of driving and fighting in the vehicle. The intensity of the physical fighting and great dynamic moves Did I laready mention atmosphere? I'm sure I did. The sandiest sandbox I have ever played in. Australian accents made by a real Australian. No-one can do a real Aussie accent . Seriously. You can't. We can tell. Also, right hand drive. Get used to it.   Now this game peaks on so many levels and it is well worth whatever you decide to spend on it, but that said - I do have a few gripes. A lot of peeps complain that the gameplay can get repetative, and whilst that is a little true, it also offers up a big variety of things for you to do - so when you are getting bored of busting bases, you can race, and when you get tired of that there are wastelander missions, scrap looting missions, convoys, minefields or just bombing around in your recently stolen vehicle admiring the scenery non-missions to do.  The intro could have been playable. The ENDGAME could have been playable - but no - all we are given is a cinematic. VERY unsatisfactory.  I don't want to spoli the end, but I'll say this:  Poor storyline at the end. Very poor in a way that makes you question whether the writers just couldn't care about putting any effort into the endings. The storyline is written to force you to fail - at EVERYTHING - and I don't care for it. It made me feel like the wiorters were just too damn lazy. I also felt very cheated on the outcomes of the major characters, both friend and foe. But, let's put that aside for a moment.  Neutral things: The car collection you can achieve is nice, but not particularly engaging unless you are a screenshot ♥♥♥♥♥ (and yeah - I find that fun). For all you other screncap ♥♥♥♥♥s, there is a nifty in-game feature to let you get your own caps and vid - and that's a very cool thing. Car collection? Well - I guess it might be what you make of it.  Races - well, very musch a lot of fun if you want to compete amongst friend or be the bestest of the bestest. A good addition.  Overall - this game certainly rocks!  My advice - Don't get too caught up with the storyline - get your V8 early-ish and have fun blowing ♥♥♥♥ up!   ",

I think the issue with some of the negative mainstream reviews is that we have non-Mad Max fans expecting the wrong things from a Mad Max game. Mad Max should be filled with brutal, fast paced action and that’s exactly what I’ve experienced so far. Sure it’s not perfect and it’s true that there’s nothing new or innovative here at all but that doesn’t mean the game is trash. The driving is decent (better than most), the gun combat is ok (par for the course) but the hand-to-hand combat is GREAT (above average for sure). So far the story is decent but again it’s not groundbreaking. The marks of a good game are how well the core mechanics function. If you have a great soundtrack, graphics and storyline but poor gameplay mechanics you’ve realistically paid $60 for some cool tunes with pretty pictures and some neat voice acting and that’s not the case here. The devs did a good job at nailing what makes Mad Max, Mad Max. For non-Mad Max fans I give this game a 6/10 (just a bit above average) and for Mad Max fans I give it a 7/10 (above average).",

Driving the cars feels good, the fighting is a-la-arkham so you'll either love it or hate it (near the end, I chose to just shoot and stab everyone because a fully loaded shotgun + ammo belt makes Max a walking Guns-n-Shivs-r-Us.)  It's a big open world that you can do whatever you like in- and progresses nicely with the story. It truly is vast and for being out in a sandy desert is pretty varied.  Ammo, Guzzaline, Water and Food are how you survive out in the wasteland-- and all of them are waaaaay too easy to find. You can also upgrade strongholds to provide free top-ups of each. Upgrading Max makes the game really easy- which makes the hand-to-hand combat tedious, and if you decide to thunderpoon every vehicle you see, the car fights are also boring.  Sounds like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing more than praising-- sorry. The game is PRETTY and has a camera mode which is fun to play with. It's also optimized AMAZINGLY for PC-- kudos for Avalanche/WB for this, it's not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. I have a GTX 960 and was nearly at 60fps all day long on the highest setting, the only time it dips is when you're inside a small dark area and using the flashlight.  The story's not bad and fills in what happens right before Fury Road (the movie.)  I'll liken the game to Assassin's Creed II-- a bit more varied than AC1 for sure, but there is a lot of repetition.  Also, the boss fights suck.  But who cares, you can upgrade the Magnum Opus into a sexy dune basher and burn all over the desert-- as speedy or as tanky as you personally like.  I didn't really understand the point of the Archangels at all-- by the time I could build one, I had gear better than what it provided. Meh.  I recommend Mad Max if you like open world, car driving, face bashing, apocalyptic kill-em-alls' and don't mind grinding to improve your car for the sake of posting sick screenshots of you setting ♥♥♥♥ on fire.

Before I begin, I want to point out that I did say that this was a recommended game, but sadly after playing for 90 hours, I see that my over excited attitude was a bit misplaced and I need to change my review. For those who read this previously and agreed to it, I am very sorry, but for those who have not bought the game, please read what I have to say about this game.  PROs ==== 1.) The game has a HUGE world for you to work with 2.) Lots of missions to accomplish 3.) Lots of side quests to keep you busy 4.) Lots of locations to go to 5.) Lots of vehicles to collect 6.) Lots of upgrades to find and equip 7.) Lots of great places to restore supplies (water, gas, etc...) 8.) Lots of hand to hand combat fighting 9.) Plenty of things to do outside the main missions  CONs ==== 1.) Missions and side quests are more about fetching and returning 2.) The things you do are more repeated than seperate 3.) A lot of the required accomplishments are pretty easy (Although I played similar games) 4.) Combat is more hand to hand since you can only hold about 6 ammo for your shotgun 5.) Hand to hand combat is just 1 button while defense has 2 buttons 6.) Chumbucket will ONLY join you in the Magnum Opus 7.) Dinki-Di will ONLY join you in the buggy (Required for mine locations) 8.) Other vehicles don't really serve a purpose except possibly for the races 9.) The only real missions I enjoyed doing were the ones where you help build the bases up 10.) You can win the vehicles in races, but it's more satisfying to find them and steal them 11.) You can't have Dinki-Di and Chumbucket at the same time 12.) A lot of the locations which require destroying are not as challenging 13.) Overall, nothing unique about this game, a lot of elements are taken from other games 14.) You have to get pretty close to use the harpoon and gun when in vehicle combat  SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER ABOUT THIS GAME!!! ======================================== Many aspects of this game don't give the ideal concept of realism. On top of that, a lot of the missions, quests and other accomplishments don't give any real sense of accomplishment. The whole point to most of the quests are to lower the threat level of each region you enter so you don't get attacked as often, as well as to collect scrap, which is the games form of money to help build up your character, car, and outposts. Although this is actually fine, there's other things going on that don't show a sense of realism. For example, the fuel tanker routes don't really lead to ANY location on the map. To top it off, it doesn't serve any REAL purpose other than to gain a trophy and to lower the threat level. Why would a fuel tanker be a 'threat'? Most cases, it's more of a threat to anyone who would be near it when it explodes. I even managed to steal a tanker, only to find out you can't have a fuel tanker for any reason. I find this to be a bit odd as you can get other vehicles, but not a tanker. I would think that if you designed a 'route' that a vehicle is taking, it would do more than just lower a threat level. How about making it so that the tanker actually enters a building, and either steal it to gain fuel, or maybe destroy it so that the base it's coming from loses say electricity or the vehicles stop working after a while. (This is just one example) Clearly they didn't take into a more psychological point of view when making this game. These days, missions or quests should have a sense of accomplishment as well as have different ways to make you feel good in that it served an 'in-game' purpose throughout the whole game.  Also, I noticed that 'stealth' wasn't in the developers list of 'Things to add in the game'. Most games I have played offer some kind of way to 'sneak' or 'stealth' your way into a camp, base, even on someone who is walking away and can't see you. In this game, no matter where you are, you are noticed coming a mile away, even if you walked all the way there, you are still noticed. It's as if you can be seen and heard coming a mile away, especially in areas where it is almost void of life. I would have thought that this would be ideal for locations that have alternate ways of entering the base so you wouldn't 'set off alarms'. Oddly, the only purpose the 'alternate' routes of entering a base serves is to simply avoid wasting resources to open the 'front door'.  Plus, the jump button is almost useless, as you only jump a few 'inches' off the ground instead of say 3-4 feet off the ground. The jump may as well be left out of the game as the locations you reach have plenty of ways to climb up a high platform.  And hey, wouldn't it be cool if you could ride, say, a bike? Nope, no bikes at all in this game, even though it was clearly in all the movies. I guess they thought that since the enemy would only be using vehicles with 4 wheels, it would be a super disadvantage to make bikes.  My biggest one is why you need 2 different vehicles to transport 2 different passengers. For some reason there is no way to transport Dinki-Di and Chumbucket in the same vehicle, even though it's clearly big enough for Dinki-Di to fit in the back seat of the car. I guess it was to create a challenge for the game itself.  The hand to hand combat is okay, it's pretty cool to be able to bash their brains in while knowing when you block and counter attack the next guy that wants to do the same to you. The attack and counter attack is a neat idea and works well for this game.  The extra DLC has absolutely no outcome of the game nor does it serve a real function other than to have another car frame. The DLC doesn't even give you improvements over the other car frames you collect.  About the only real enjoyment I had was simply collecting the cars 1 by 1. I have only been stealing them as well as finding them from certain locations which have special vehicles parked at the landmarks. Although I have not particpated in the races, I think I would have enjoyed finding and stealing them more as they offer a certain satisfaction after stealing them. From what I could tell, the only purpose the races offered, outside gaining vehicles, was to open additional 'fast travel' as well as offered refueling locations for you to go to when you are running low on fuel.  This game starts out strong and enjoying, but you later see that all you are doing is playing 'fetch the stick'. So much repeated missions as well as so much repeated boss fights that this game loses challenge because you see the truth that you just repeat and repeat, over and over to accomplish all your missions and quests. My suggestion, wait til it's $20 or less.  OVERALL ======= The main thing to remember is that this game is a lot of fun. Regardless of my rants, there's plenty to do, lots of things going on while you accomplish your missions, and more than enough to keep you busy. The only thing to consider is that you will be doing constantly the same thing over and over. The map is insanely huge so there is that. Lots of vehicles to collect and make. Plenty of places to go and side quests to accomplish.  HIGHS ===== Huge map, tons of locations, lots of vehicles to find, plenty of things to keep you busy, and enough of a challenge to allow you to come back for more...  LOWS ===== Tedious meaningless mindless tasks that, although help you get more scrap as well as lower threat levels, takes way too much time to accomplish while you are trying to finish the main game itself.",

Would have been nice to see some variance in items (collecting wires, sheet metal, finding actual parts instead of amorphous 'scrap')  The NPCs you encounter in the wasteland serve very little point. Share your water with them, feel better about yourself? Good because it doesn't really seem to do much else. You can listen to them mumble and sometimes point you in the direction of scrap because there isn't already tons of it littering the countryside.  Exploring the interior levels was fun and they are gorgeous, but I was never 'discovering' anything. There were no surprises or secrets. It counts down how much more scrap you have to find and tells you when you've found it all. For all the work that obviously went into designing the levels, they seem sterile and missing personality. The incentive to explore new locations ran out when I knew all I could get was more scrap and already had plenty.  I still enjoyed all 50 hours that I played, and I can see myself going back and visiting my hunchback friend in the future just to make life miserable for the bad guys of the wasteland.",

Pros: - Rock solid port it seems like, with consistent FPS on upper end settings (my machine is more mid tier than top of the line) - Interesting and varied gameplay between arkham style foot combat, car combat, exploration and upgrading - Great voice acting and script seems quality thus far - Graphically true to the Mad Max series, explosions, combat and theatrics feel powerful and emphasized.   Cons: - I can't create my own road warrior? - With controller, button configuration doesn't necessarily feel natural (often find myself firing off shotgun shells accidentally) But that could be a good thing. It breaks from the norm, but not in an unreasonable way, just wasn't quite ready for it.  Overall a really welcomed surprise.",

This game does a really great job of incorporating the lore and feel of the Mad Max movies while feeling like something that could also stand alone without the backing of said movies. That to me, is an important distinction.  I will keep it short and sweet in regard to my review.  Pros - The vehicle combat is the true highlight for me; always fast and intense. This also holds true for hand to hand and melee weapon combat, which ends up feeling alot like the hand to hand combat systems from the Arkham or Shadow of Mordor games.  Cons - Very simple. Exhuasting and uninteresting gameplay loop. You will get a good 20 hours of enjoyment out of this title, but continuing your progress through to completion will be a real labor of love.  Overall, it has my recommendation with one caveat. Buy it on sale.",

            "review_text": "I didn't expect this to be as good as it is, usually very untrusting of movie adaptions but the devs actualy give sh*t about this game and it's not the usual blatant money grabbing from WB.  After Batman (the new sh*tty one) where they actually had to take it off and repair the game, I thought this wouldn't be well optimised but it is, very well, I'm almost in disbelief. It runs on my fx-6300 and R9 270x (4gb) at around 70fps consistently on high settings.   The game looks f*cking amazing as well, the environments are beautiful and the particle effects are great but the characters don't really share the same level. They look just a bit samey and kinda stand out from the environment for not looking as good.   The driving is pretty good, it takes getting used to though and a controller might be better as it's not often you need to aim and even then it's in slo-mo (except sniper/shotgun). Vehicles to tend to feel a bit sluggish but the sense of speed is good. Car upgrades are pretty powerful, but in harder sections the more difficult cars need some serious gear to take down easily (upgrade the sh*t out of the harpoon).  There's loads to do as well, multiple sectors of increasing difficulty to play with by destroying oil camps, legions, top brass or scarecrows. What's good is it doesn't feel that repetitive, not sure why but I actually feel like I want to go and 100% everything, never been like that before.   Combat is mostly melee which works like batman or AC, parry and attack, dodge that, shoot them if need be. It's fun but not as fluid as batman and doesn't have as many moves. Still works great though, although there's a move I just learnt where you snap their arm, like fully it goes backwards, and they just get back up and are fine?? Doesn't really make sense, would be better if they just used other limbs instead or just stayed on the floor in pain.  Health is replenished by water/food which is kinda easily found, same for ammo although you can hold like one shell to begin with... Also fuel is used up by driving which needs replenishing after a couple hours-ish. Again no big problem.   The story is like most open world games in that it shows you being all badass, get f*cked up and have to rebuild. The end goal is to get to the plains of silence or something, basically just have peace. It's decent enough but don't expect Metal Gear level.   Overall it's a great game.   ",

            "review_text": "A fun, and enjoyable game.   Do NOT get hyped about this game. Take it slow and enjoy it, do not expect overly great things from this game.   It is 100% singleplayer with the only real multiplayer aspect being race times.  For an open world game, this game is very cinematic. Not just in the story, but also in how you destroy vehicles and watch them burn. A lot of really nice cinematic moments.  Pros: 1. Really really well optmized. Even on my weaker pc, the game handles pretty well with minimal frame drops.  2. Not too overwhelming of an open world game. I personally dislike open world games. I love the concept of them, but they don't do well with the balance between story or side missions and then fill them with meaningless collectables. This game balances the two and makes it feel like you can 100% the game within 100 hours. I like to take my time with games, specially ones that are single player and story driven (hehe). So I do recommend playing this game if you have time to spare and just enjoy the wasteland. It's definitely one that open world gamers will chew up really quickly. I, not being an open world gamer, took my time to enjoy what the game offers before finishing the story missions.  3. Tons of destruction: This game will constantly put you in fights throughout the wasteland. It's a little annoying at times but it's not too bad. More-so when you have your ride geared up. I've yet to get bored of destroying vehicles and watch them fall off cliffs and exploding.  4. Gorgeous: It's just a lovely, beautiful game with a ton of epic camera angles. I could probably spend a day driving through the wasteland and taking snap-shots of Max standing over a cliff and looking over the wasteland.   Cons: 1. Repetitive: I know this is a constant complaint about this game but it truly is repetitive. The boss fights are pretty much carved out of everything you've already done in the game, just with more health. It's still a fun game but I would've liked to see some more variations. About halfway through the game, you can experience almost everything it has to offer. 2. Story/side missions not replayable: I love replaying missions from my other games like Max Payne. Again, I'm not an open world gamer so this really does bug me a lot when I can't replay an epic mission.  3. A bit short: This is a double-edge sword. The game is fun but it is short with content and story. Just about any open world gamer will complete this game relatively quickly. If you don't play that many open world games or if you want to play open world games, I'd recommend to start with this one. Even for me, the story was too short and although it had some really cool moments, it didn't quite reach my expectations.  4. Not enough racing: So this is more of a car-combat game, like Twisted Metal. So although racing is part of this game and there are a few races to play, it focuses more on the vehicular combat. I'm a bit mixed about it and I feel they could've been a little more aggresive with the races.   Overall, if I had to rate the game, I'd give it a 7/10. It's great, it's fun, it can probably run on a toaster. It's just a bit lacking in story and would definitely need more content to have a higher rating. This is one of those very few times where I would beg for DLC.",

Out of every big game release this year, I would have to say this is the best one by far. Aside from the very rare graphical glitch, and sound glitches, this game has not stopped running at 60 FPS.

However, as much as I profess to say it engaged me, it's not for everyone. You'll be riding around a good while in a burnt out wasteland with nothing but a deranged hunch back of a companion in a rattle-trap of a vehicle, combing it for scrap as you desperately build your car to become death on wheels.

The story was also a highlight for me as I really like well put together stories in games, and this seemed to fit the Mad Max universe even if it was a bit of a reimaging of the Max character, though this didnt bother me in the least and did not in any way hurt the game at all.  Gameplay was awesome except for the few bugs I did encounter in my playthrough, but it was very atmospheric. Tense when it needed to be, sometimes scary in area's, and action-filled all around.   It does start off a bit slow in the begining and can be a bit frustrating for new players (as was for me) but after you collect some scrap and begin upgrading Max and the Magnum Opus, it really opens up considerably.  Would recommend to anyone. I'm a big PC gamer, though for this one I would recommend having an X-Box 360/X-Box One/Logitech F710 controller as to me it just seems suited to one, much like the Arkham series does as well.",

The game looks amazing in most areas like lighting and effects but they could have done a better job on the characters, especially as the 'Top Dogs' are all the same character just with a slightly different outfit.

The intro to the game is wonderful, very well done. A lot better than Witcher 3 and most games that have been released in the last year. Very artsy, very well done.  The game itself, the story, I like it. I'm not a big fan of the Mad Max series. I saw the first film, that is it. But I like the characters, the narrative, the story.  The thing I like best about the game is that for me, this is the first game that actually really looks great in 4K. I mean the difference between 1080 and 4K in this game is very dramatic and I am playing it in 4K with a single GTX970 and getting 60-70 FPS solid. The game is very well optimized. I get 144 FPS solid in the game with 970 SLI.  Only a couple of negatives to report. My Logitech conroller won't work in the game, and this seems to not be an isolated problem.

            "review_text": "As a PC gamer I was a little apprehensive going into this game, after feeling let down by Shadows of Mordor, which was similarly designed mainly with the console player in mind. In particular I was worried about the lack of difficulty levels or any real mod scene that could make the game harder. I like a challenge and I often find that lacking with these kinds of run-here collect-that kill-him kind of open world console games. I'm going to compare Mad Max below to Shadows of Mordor quite a bit, because its a nice way to highlight what this game does well.   The best thing I can say about Mad Max is this: Twenty hours in I definitely want to play this game right through to the end, unlike Shadows of Mordor, which I enjoyed initially, only to find that I just couldn't be bothered to pick up again after finishing the first area.  It does suffer from some similar problems. Repetition of a few basic tasks, looting, killing, looting, killing, again and again and again. A world that is a little too forgiving, allowing you to rarely feel seriously threatened even when vastly outnumbered.   However Mad Max, I think, is at its core a superior game.   Yes, Shadows of Mordor has the Nemesis system, which gives you a dynamic army of orc captains to fight. Meanwhile the bosses of Mad Max are your old static type. The orcs themselves in Shadows of Mordor are also a great enemy to hate, while a lot of the enemies in Mad Max feel bland. Going further, the combat in Shadows of Mordor is fluid and very professionally done, while movement and combat in Mad Max can feel a bit clunky. There is no sneaking, no acrobatics, and you often feel frustrated by your inability to even climb over simple barriers.  However the wasteland is a much more realised and lovingly crafted setting than mordor. From the overall design of the different regions, to the huge variety of gorgeous textures and colors, to the tiny details put into the little camps you raid, you really feel like you are in an actual world that is a pleasure to inhabit. The landscape nicely balances your two modes of play: Open vistas for high speed racing, and more cramped nooks and crannies for exploring on foot. Switching between these two helps alleviate any sense of tedium of always doing the same thing.  Meanwhile the world is also responsive in a way that Shadow of Mordor's is not. Bases can be taken over. Towers and snipers removed. Minefields cleared. And as a result the threat level of the area drops. The strongholds you 'upgrade' are also being saved by you from the brink of destruction, slowly coming back from the edge and developing into actual decent little towns.   This sense of progress is perhaps the strongest aspect of the game, beyond the pure fun of racing about the place. Your car gets better. Your equipment gets better. And these upgrades directly relate to your ability to take on harder enemies. Most importantly, the upgrade path seems well balanced, such that you won't quickly become capable of taking out everybody and everything, which is the biggest problem in Shadows of Mordor. As you progress further you find that you have to put a decent amount of work into getting the scrap you need to upgrade just one part of your car. Basically, Mad Max will reward your OCD tendencies. It's repetetive, but in a good way.  Above all, this is a fun game. It's been made with plenty of love and care, and with a decent budget. It's a little clunky in places. And the design falls down here and there. But it has a fully realized setting, a responsive world, a fairly decent difficulty scaling, a good upgrade path, great racing mechanics, and some fun characters (Chumbucket alone makes this game for me). I'd definitely recommend it to any PC gamer, even if not on sale.",

            "review_text": "While there are many jokes about this game being an Austrailian outback simulator, the game itself isn't a joke. For something sort-of was under the radar and had a very silent launch (If memory serves me right, MAD MAX launched alongside Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.) and while people were preoccupied with MGSVTPP, those that did pre-order MAD MAX got a very pleasant surprise, The game ran well at launch, hell it was really well-optimized. To have to be surprised every time a new game does that sure shows the state of the games industry nowadays.   MAD MAX (2015) The game follows Max Rockatansky in his quest to cross the plains of silence. You are in control of Max, and while there are no far-reaching consequences to your decisions in game, playing as Max is interesting to say the least.  The game offers open-world exploration, driving in said open-world, melee combat and car customization. Melee combat is reminiscent of the Arkham games where combat is basically 'punch, punch, heavy attack, dodge, counter, dodge, counter, finishing move animation, rinse and repeat.' What makes the combat fun is when Max is swarmed and his FURY™ counter gets filled up and he goes into a powered up state in which he is almost able to one-hit almost any enemy type. This does not make you overpowered at all, but it does help in moments where you're really in need of a pick-me-up.  Driving in the wasteland is interesting as you will encounter enemy drivers who will not hesitate to ram you off whatever is left of the road so they can chew on your innards. Customizing your car, the Magnum Opus, grants you various advantages and disadvantages that you can of course tweak to your taste. You can also customize Max, but you are limited to a few options in terms of hair, facial hair, whether or not you want some oil, dirt or face paint on you, as well as different iterations of the leather jacket (or rather progression as it gets armored up as you progress.)  As I played the game, I tried to avoid the main quest for as long as I could before I either get bored or can't hold the excitement of wanting to know what happens next. If you want to finish the main quests easily, doing all the side activities will help. But if you choose not to, the experience gets a bit harder.   Do I recommend this game? Do I think you should pick it up? Do I think you should spend money getting it? Well, yes.",

            "review_text": "I was a bit on the fence about this game when I first played it but I gradually became immersed in this world. Graphically this game is beautiful and the car combat and ground combat are both incredibly satisfying. Downing enemy vehicles is very enjoyable with awesome explosions that play out in different ways due to the incredible in-game physics cars can veer into each other causing chain reactions.   Smashing into enemy structures with your customized war machine is immensley satisfying and it actually affects the enemies hold on a territory. Take out a base and you will obtain it as an allied camp and it will generate scrap for you which you will use to customize max or your main vehicle the 'Magnum Opus'.   Any enemy vehicles you manage to capture and bring back to your stronghold will add to your car collection and the vehicle selection on offer is wide and varied.  The more territory you capture the better as it weakens the state of the enemies hold on that region.   Sound is excellent and theres some proffessional voice acting here which really pulls you into the game world. Random storms can hit at any moment so hunkering down somewhere is recommended as the wild winds will toss up debris that will damage you and your vehicle.  My only two gripes about this game is it will slow down in large bases. (This shoudn't be a problem though on an I7). Also the jumping mechanic when scaling rocks is a little weak but using your car to scale large mountains is fun.  A large world to explore and many hidden secrets to discover.  The closest thing to being in the movie Fury Road.  If interstate 76 and fallout 4 had a baby this would be it.  Overall a fantastic experience and since it was on special a must have purchase.  Tips: Destroying an insignia saves your game which is useful in large bases  Water and ammo is scarce in this wasteland so I suggest building the armoury in a stronghold as soon as possible so your ammunition will replenish every time you enter the stonghold.  Destroy as many bases as possible to keep an income of scrap coming in.",

Cars are ace but i will say the handling is so so. The combat with the cars on the other hand is amazing! Nothing better than pulling an enemy driver out if the car with the silly ragdog effects. The game runs flawless and is very optimised on my 780ti. I will say they could have put more effort into the boss battles as they all pretty much are the same but with different colours.

Gameplay Impressions:  So far I like the game, to the contrary of many of the Negative Reviews, I like the controls, but they should have been thought out a little better as defaults. The game also plays extremely well with the mouse and keyboard, again contrary to many of the -Neg reviews. I guess I dont blame developers for thoughtless control mapping, but rather blame myself for not picking up on them fast enough.  Character movement and Vehicle movement / Map Navigation. Both are good, they have the perfect amount of feedback, the cars have very nice weight and slip systems and very easy to control.  Character and Vehicle Combat. I've never been a fan of the button mash style fighting system, but this feels just as good as any of the best games out there doing it, Including the Batman Series, Witcher 3 and GTA 5. Vehicle combat is also well thoughtout, but due to odd control mapping it can be challenging. I was able to figure it out pretty quickly after a few fails.  There is some bad level design decisions you'll discover, for one the character cant climb much and cant jump very high. This is normally not a big deal, but there are things you'll be trying, logically, assuming you can climb up certain objects, but you cant. Climbable objects are Designated much in the same way they are depicted in Tomb Raider. Dont expect Raider'ish control though, and once you've gotten over that, the movement is well done and works well.  The Story seems decent enough, C'mon, these game plots are nearly always crap, and you know it, 90% of gaming suffers from crappy storylines. Try to base your expectations lower here and you'll have a good time.  Graphics:  Visually, I like everything about the graphics, detailed models, great animations, solid voice acting, interesting locations I dig it. Would I change certain things, oh yeah. So much empy open space, yet nothing really to discover. This game needs tons of lootable caves to explore and gather stuff - (yeah, I'm refering to Skyrim here.)  Performance: The graphics look great maybe I wasnt expecting much, but theyre as good as they need to be. Simply put, the game looks great, even the wieniest of the graphics cards (in my case the a Stock '2gb GTX 650') with my settings (mostly Normal, but a few Ultra Settings @ 900p, the game is comfortably sitting between 45-55 fps, a few lower in complex environments and gameplay sections but its never dropped below 35 fps for me. I'm thinking I can increase the resolution to 1080 and it will sit at 30 fps or more. Not bad.  Thats it for now. I have a feeling the game becomes a grind after a few hours, but we'll see. I'll update this review as I go.",

            "review_text": "I got it on sale, but still, given the fun I've had, I wouldn't have minded paying the full price.   This game isn't perfect, though. I really missed stuff like those huge concentrations of enemy vehicles in pursuit, like in the movies...  Anyway, let's go with the good, the bad and the ugly.    The Good:  +Overall, the game has beautiful graphics, with some exceptions (more on that later).  +It runs like butter (i7+R9 290)   +Like the rest of WB games I've played (Batman saga, Shadow of Mordor), it's very stable and has very few bugs. It still has a couple of clamorous bugs, though (more on that later)  +Pretty decent voice acting, Chumbucket is pretty hilarious sometimes.  +Pretty decent progression mechanics, vehicle and character upgrades, stronghold upgrades, etc.  +Driving through the wasteland with the Magnum Opus, laying waste to enemy camps and chasing convoys is pretty sick. But, as I said, I missed certain things (more on that later).  +Combat is savage and enjoyable, although with certain limitations (more on that later)  +The game has very nice touches like massive and deadly sandstorms, survival elements which include eating worms from corpses, keeping your canteen and fuel tank filled, etc. Thunderpoons are also sick.    The Bad:  -The main story is perhaps too short and simple. So much happens so fast, without really giving the story time to build up for the big moments.    -Repetitive grind. This isn't an issue for me, since I don't mind grinding in games that I like. However, you might get tired of clearing enemy camps and collecting loot in repetitive ways. Personally, I didn't get tired since I took it as part of the experience. Anyway, there are plenty of games out there that force the player to grind in a much more painful and tedious manner.   -This game lacks those huge concentrations of enemy vehicles from the movies, it's pretty scarcely populated with enemy vehicles, overall. 'Large' concentrations of enemy vehicles are limited to convoys and war parties, and even then, those are pretty small (less than 10 vehicles).  Also, once you destroy a convoy in a region, it's gone for good, it won't respawn ever again.  -The game is way too easy. Very little challenge overall, plus the Magnum Opus is essentially indestructible, as long as you exit the vehicle within 5 seconds of having lost all hp points.  Combat is pretty straightforward, it's essentially the same combat system fround in other WB games like the Batman saga and Shadow of Mordor, but perhaps a bit simpler (less variety and density of enemies). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since I quite like to keep it simple sometimes, it's just too easy, that's all.  At least in the Batman saga there was challenge introduced by the sheer number of enemies. In this game you'll find concentrations of up to 12 enemies, with some variation, that's about all the challenge you'll get... It's still fun to break skulls with savage strikes, but, you know, being that easy it kind of takes from the experience.    -The game lacks combat gore for my taste. No dismemberments, beheadings, etc. There are plenty of gore elements scattered around the map, like tons of corpses impaled on scarecrows, rotten corpses pretty much everywhere, truly disgusting body piles, etc., but there's almost no gore in combat, which is strange.  Although there are several combos that are painful to watch (broken legs, arms, necks and skulls), and you can stick enemies with the harpoon and drag their corpses around the wasteland, or stick thunderpoons in them and watch their bodies explode, there's almost no gore in combat.  Sometimes, if you get lucky, you can stick enemies to the Magnum Opus by equipping some spikes and running them over in the right way, but it's not a built-in feature (if it is, doesn't look like it). In my opinion, this game lacks the great combat gore found in Shadow of Mordor, but I guess we can't have it all, can we?  -Absence of fear effects in combat. Enemy cars do run away after getting overpowered by the player, but that doesn't happen in combat, which is a real pity. In Shadow of Mordor, it was delicious to make orcs panic by massacring their mates.  -I've found a couple of game breaking bugs, sadly.  There's a camp in Pink Eye's territory called Havoc Point. This camp can't be cleared in the usual way because the door is bugged. There's probably some script that fails to activate, preventing spawns that unlock the door, so it stays closed and there's apparently no way to open it.  So you have to find a workaround for it. I had fun getting creative, tbh, the workaround is kind of challenging and fun, but this is still a major bug that needs to be fixed. (I'll leave a description of the workaround at the end, for those of you who are desperate and don't know what else to try).  There's another bug that makes one of the scarecrows disappear as you approach it, so it can't be destroyed. I think it's located in Pink Eye's territory too, on top of a destroyed highway overpass. Some people claim that it eventually reappears, I still have to check it out, though. Last I checked it was still invisible.    Then there are other minor bugs, like some npcs that apparently don't unlock any side missions or anything when you interact with them... which looks like a bug, since those npcs are marked on the map and are supposed to unlock locations, loot, and other stuff.  You also tend to get run over by enemy patrols when you are interacting with said npcs, which shouldn't happen.    -Character jump...it's a joke.   The Ugly:  -Low polygon rock models in several places, which are masked with dark textures, in order to give the impression of grooves where there are none. Well, I NOTICED! And I don't approve of lousy 3D modelling work! XD.  -Low polygon chains, which basically consist of two lines of flat chain textures, arranged in a cross pattern.  This was common practice in the 90s and early 2000s, but it's 2016 already, chains must be modelled with the same level of detail as the rest of stuff, otherwise what's the point?  I mean... 'This looks amazing! Look at the nice detail and beautiful effects... oh wait, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rock there and disgraceful chain here... we are still in the 90s after all'.   -Most npcs that you encounter throughout the game are basically clones of three or four character models.  This is common practice in a lot of games, but it's still ridiculous and detracts from the experience.  Also, most enemies are clones too. Sure there are different kinds of enemies, with different weapons, skills and armors, but they are all based on the same few models, making the game suck when it shouldn't.  It's like Shadow of Mordor, where all slaves were basically clones, unlike the orcs, which were pretty diverse and well modelled. It's sad to see games with so much potential being ruined by npc cloning.    That's pretty much all the stuff I could think of. Overall, I definitely recommend this game to all Mad Max fans and people looking to have a savage time raiding the post-apocalyptic wastelands in a sick Magnum Opus.  If you can get the game on sale, it's totally worth it.     *Workaround for the Havoc Point gate bug:  There are several things you can do in order to blow up the fuel tanks in the camp without having to enter it. One method consists in getting behind the camp and waiting for a sandstorm to come.  Hopefully, the sandstorm will carry lightning, blowing the tanks up for you, liberating the camp.  The method I used is funnier. I blew the tanks up by firing some thunderpoons at them, after jumping high above the rear fence with the Magnum Opus. The tricky part is achieving the jump. You'll need a maxed out V6 (or any V8). Keep the Margum Opus light and fast, without ramming grill. Get behind the camp and use the natural rock ramp located beside the convoy road to make the jump.",

You find a lot from all the movies - most from Fury Road - but anyway - I liked Mad Max 2 the most and being able to recreate the old car was just too cool. I liked the characters being part of the story. The partner who throws hooks and bombs and his comments are funny. The fist fights are not too difficult , so one doesn't have to start all over all the time. There are many other things I can praise, but enough of it...  The only thing that I thought got boring to the last third of the game was that the missions to free the regions were a bit tiring and pretty much the same repeating stuff. But riding around in those cars in a very realistic sunset and this kind of setting was so enjoyable that in the end I was happy. And that's the most important - a game that makes you happy to have played it and not too difficult to make through all the challenges. Please more of this!  In comparison: I am a huge LOTR fan, but Shadow of Mordor is still on the system not played to the end - it was not gripping enough to keep me in the game playing it through. The new battlefront looks great, but without a story... sorry - just running, flying etc around is not enough. And it's not available on steam.",

            "review_text": "The game doesn't do anything new. If you like games such as Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, and other open world titles, you'll like this one.   The atmosphere is pretty good, and while the wasteland can get rather boring to look at, well, that's kind of the point of a wasteland to begin with. Death is everywhere, and seeing just how quickly and completely humanity has descended into barbarism is just as jarring as it is in the films; indeed it makes me think of the Comedian's philosophy from the comic and film versions of Watchmen. Sad thing is, I really don't think it's all that far-fetched, but that's a discussion outside of a review.   As said, it's a run of the mill open world game with the addition of a customizable vehicle. Vehicular combat can be a lot of fun, and there are a variety of different strategies and weapons at your disposal to deal with opponents. Should you use some of your precious ammo to blow up a few gas tanks, or wear down their armor so you can rip off a wheel with the harpoon? Is it worth it to spend precious fuel on your car's flamethrower, or are your rims spiky enough to grind their car to scrap? Really, the only downside of car combat is the sometimes wonky as hell physics. A full-on crash sometimes barely moves either vehicle, yet barely scraping a barrier can send you into a wild airborne spin. Out in the world it's not so bad, but during certain story races it's absolutely maddening.   Other than the vehicle, the one thing that stands out is the storms. These things are TERRIFYING during the early game, and even late game you can find yourself in trouble if you're not careful. There are several different types, ranging from relatively low winds but with lighting which behaves more like artillery fire, to turbulent winds which blow debris hard enough to knock your car straight off the road, and send poor Max ragdolling a good fifty feet. They're really well done and a lot of fun, but sadly they don't really occur as often as I'd like.   Ground combat is pretty much ripped from Arkham Asylum / Shadow of Mordor style games. It's fun, it works well, and Max's punches definitely feel very weighty. Countering can become problematic due to the camera at times, because unlike the Batman games or Shadow of Mordor, the parry prompt isn't visible if the enemy is off screen, which can lead to some very frustrating moments. Furthermore sometimes parrying just doesn't seem to work in really 'busy' fights, however this might be my own fault (don't have that problem in SoM though). Still, it's a relatively minor issue.   The game is a solid 8. Good open world fun, good ground and fantastic car combat. It's nicely done if you can forgive the fact that it brings very few new ideas to the table, and can get pretty repetitive. Still, I recommend it to fans of the genre, doubly so for fans of the Mad Max franchise.",

The main story doesn't unlock all the best upgrades, you have to get those from lowering threat in areas.  Gameplay 8.5/10 -Definately one of the best action games I have played, story was alright, but the gameplay, like the fighting was a real button mash, beat em up game and it was really good.  Graphics 9/10 -Graphics like the car parts, and the bases were really detailed, and very immersive, there is bodies hanging from ceilings, there are bodies that are torn apart for food, it is really graphical.  Environment 8.5/10 -This game is one of the best environmental games, massive sand dunes, there is remnants of a civilization all over the place, whether it be an airport, or just a simple highway, it really makes you feel in a different world  Immersion 6/10 -The game's first person camera is absolute garbage, the game really lacks a real sense of challenge because either it's fighting a lot of enemies or finding a lot of transfer tanks, which is repetitive and boring. The explosions in the cutscenes are bad because it explodes and you are just standing 10-20 feet away from it.",

This problem is not unique to Mad Max, but it stood out in a user experience that largely includes pleasant, even familiar things. Also, making deeper characters of the friendly/enemy warlords and their bands would have made building up friendly bases and crushing enemy lairs even more satisfying.  Over all, however, a very fun experience.

While the cast is different, it really works well. If you are into Cars, looting, missions, free roam, upgrading vehicles and hideouts, and surreal graphics, go for it. The gameplay is arcadish. The reason I say that, isn't so much because of the physics, but more because of the gameplay itself. For example nitro auto refills, and when your Magnum Opus (car) gets damaged, all you need to do is get out and your mechanic will fix it in the middle of a dessert without parts, like new. SO while it isn't realistic, its still fun and enjoyable to play. You do however have health, gas, and ammo that have to be manually refilled.  Graphics 8/10 The superchargers on the motors don't turn, and there are a some minor visual glitches (nothing to be worried about)  Audio 7/10 Amazing sound but the V6 engines sound like a V8. All the vehicles do sound different though.  Gameplay 8/10 There's lots of stuff to do in this game. So if you start to get bored you can always do something different like, collecting scrap which is the currency in this game, taking down other hideouts, collecting cars, etc...

The combat system is absolutely fantastic both in-car and on-foot, and the sheer amount of violence and explosions is enough to make anyone happy. If you’re a fan of games that let you play your own way, Mad Max is definitely a game for you. There are multiple ways to tackle almost every area of Mad Max, and customisation is a huge theme throughout the game – it’s very much your personal game. Even though scrap collection can be tedious, it’s all worth it when you buy the upgrade you’ve been waiting for and you feel the improvement it makes to your cars handling and performance.  In fact, I was really surprised about just how good Mad Max is when compared to the amount of attention its getting. I think its down to timing - it was released on the same day as Metal Gear Solid V, a game that people have been waiting for, for years. In all the MGSV excitement, it seems Mad Max has been pushed to one side and even though it's a fantastic game, I don't think it'll get the recognition it deserves.",

The post apocalyptic desert with scarce resources and people a half way or more closer to becoming an animals.   The graphics and easiness that my computer dealt with it (2yrs old PC with Radeon R9 200) is really impressive.  I love the locations. Their diversity, they looks, their climate. The biggest surprise that you can make so much out of sand, dirt, stones, rocks, rust and scrap and maybe a little bit of human flesh as decoration. Hands down the best part of the game. I am really impressed with e.g. camps (the ones you take over). Surprising how different they are.  I really like the story. It is not long but both main story missions and wasteland ones are really good. One disadvantage is that there is not as many of them as it should be ... for my taste.  I quite enjoy the cars, their looks, the feel when driving, the scope and selection of modifiers they have and the battles in them. Also the possibility to free-roam almost everywhere is quite satisfying.   I also really liked the characters. There is not much of them but they are created quite well in regards of looks, characters, behaviour and dialogues. Max included.  The amount and quality of opponents is also more than enough.  The melee fights was something I had some problems with in terms of having fun but when I got used to it and developed my main character I started to have some enjoyment out of it. Keep in mind it is just not my kind of thing.  Now the things I do not like. The repetitiveness of other than main story and wasteland missions. Most people will find it tiresome and too boring after a while (mine sweeping yay). I stuck with it cause of other things (mentioned above). It is something many sandbox games are struggling with and Mad Max tries to balance it with other qualities. Nevertheless it is not the best result.   I do not like the bugs. Only good thing about them that there is not much of them and are mainly a minor ones. The game only crashed once so with over 90 hours it is quite a good result.  Boss fights. They are almost the same with little variety to actual fights (shotgun and shivs ftw).  General difficulty. You cannot change it and most of the time I found this game quite easy. There are some difficulty peaks (main story boss fight) but I died like 10 times and mostly cause I wanted to test out some things not of actual challenge.  And there it is. My recommendation? If the post apocalyptic world is your thing, you like the carmageddon style of driving and beating people with your fists makes you smile then go for it ... or if it is below 5€ ... then pick it up even just for the main story (around 20 hours).  EDIT: ... and I even cried once ...",

I brought it a few days after release and was immediately blown away by the visuals and detail - superb, especially in 4k.   Having said this it isn't a fantastic game, at times I found myself becoming frustrated with the tedious elements that you have to do over and over and over again to progress. Like collecting scrap - don't have a problem with finding and getting it but gets annoying when you keep having to wait for the timer circle everytime you do something. Same goes for filling your canteen and more - long winded and takes you away from the pace of the game.  The two main elements of fighting and driving are fun along with big boss fights but they get pretty easy. Even fighting the main bad guy towards the end was just a simple evade move, let him take a big swing then roll back and beat the c%^p out of him.  The best part of the game for me was building up the Magnum Opus, very rewarding as you amass enough scrap to attain each new part. One flaw tho was the v8 engine late on - so cool with the distinctive Mad Max hum taken straight from The Road Warrior movie, except you only get to use it for the last 20 mins or so of gameplay if just playing to the end of story mode. You even get the drive a carbon copy of Max's legendary 8 interceptor - at the very end of the story mode in the game.  There is also a really frustrating race where you have to destroy Stank Gun's big rig, took me about 20 attempts to get past that! Some forum fanboys say how they did it first time or found it easy - to me it frustratingly wasn't.  So all in all a good game but no classic, but I enjoyed it being a die hard fan of the Mad Max movies - tons of subtle references throughout the game, even a scene in a thunderdome at one point.  Will say this for it too - no glossy Hollywood happy ending here, the developer was very brave and dared to go full on and tread into the blackest territory at the end of story mode - but then that is the essence of Mad Max.

There are references to all 4 Mad Max movies (like the thunderdome, immortan Joe and the black on black).  The fact that you can freeroam around and get a look at the wasteland up close, aswell as collecting old photographs to get more backstory really makes this game great.   If there was something I could complain about then it would be the driving, it just isn't smooth at all when using a keyboard atleast. Several times I've failed missions because of overstearing or things like that, and its really annoying.  Apart from that then this game is great, if you like the Mad Max movies then this is the game for you obviously.  I'm going to rate it 7.5/10 just because that driving is a major part of the game and it doesn't work out that well with a keyboard.",

At first a film continuation hit, after the premiere of which it became clear, that it is possible to resurrect cultic series thoroughly and with the stamp, guaranteeing itself not only symbolic praise from fans, but also the rising tide of lots of the tangible cash. It isn't known, which factor more firmly had an influence on an Avalanche studio in the moment of the decision making about moving adventures Rockatansky'ego to three-dimensional world, but the game of the Swedish team was just going to repeat it success of George Miller. And at least about the success under the account purely growym for many reasons to say rather with difficulty, the odd charm of the production despite everything is able to stick to the monitor. Enthusiasts of the universe can sleep calmly - Max is unfolding Mad before the player vision consistent, in accordance with the spirit of cinema originals of postapocalyptic world overfilled with dirt, rust and dust. The title without ceremony at first is throwing us right in the middle of action (we are observing the film showing the bloody fight of the protagonist against outgrown Scrotusem), and next is throwing extensive roadless tracts to the very centre of sandy wildernesses ruled by self-appointed gangs and organizations, travelling across mercenaries running all over the desert in armours glued together of scrap and mutant-madmen in wagons. Authors of Just Cause series managed smoothly to lard the production with diverse tastes, characteristic notions and spectacular seat reservations, in the end integrating the grey-brown atmosphere into everything, what exerted the very positive first impression on me with - particularly that such the built place of the action, thanks to concise basics, doesn't seem hermetic and should not scare off even persons not-acquainted with the universe. The first minutes announced experience and so really promising. Unfortunately quickly to ruin the narrative-climatic liquidity very main character started …. Because Max has mentality of the thug devoid of values standing out from the crowd of other brawlers with exclusively an Australian accent. Upgrading one's cart is an only purpose motivating him - I was under the impression that for gaining access to the new bumper he would be able vacantly to shoot the pregnant woman dead (in accordance with the principle: 'and need it - and of it get it'). His actions are lacking sensible motivation - wants only to kill and to destroy more in order can go more quickly. Surprisingly - quite not better the case looks in case of marginal heroes. The entire gallery of figures having a potential constitutes the blend of rolls of film noninteresting, deprived of the personality and character, can except for a little bit of unstable Chumbucketa - of the personal Maxa mechanic and the designer of his quad bike (of called solemnly Magnum Opus). I don't know, whether behind such a state of affairs I should not burden the plot which it is possible to summarize with the fault with words: Max after loss of the first car wants to get the second car, avenging himself by the way too first. And so he is collecting the rustheap and is smashing the half of Wildernesses in order to get one's hands on the V8 engine. That kind of history won't leave too much space for ambition, but all games turning up at the more late part, 'more serious' subplots, trying at least symbolically uplastycznić story, I shrugged off - because I knew that for Maxa they weren't outweighing.   Pluses: the splendid climate, the cohesion of the represented world and keeping spirits of film originals; functional and imaginative project of the location; give the mechanic and the diversity of skirmishes; spectacular, sophisticated realization of the sequence jeżdżonych; enough developed system of improvements of the hero and his cart; considerable, diverse, well developed world; the graphical cover and the optimization. Minuses: the crude, schematic plot and heroes insipid, not-falling into the memory; repetitiveness of all activities - of both the mission, and optional tasks; subordinating the entire game to clearing scrap away;  monotony accompanying the games all along the way.

I wish I could say I was lying in some cases.  The main issue I have experienced is the batman-style combat system. When a hoard of enemies come hurling towards you at once, it's impossible (and I mean impossible) to live to smash another day when you attempt fifteen different parries at once. (I won't spoil the game for anyone, but i'll say the two words 'Buzzards' and 'Airport'). And then of course you're stuck back at the start of the rarity of which is a checkpoint.  In my opinion, the game is great but not perfect, the combat system needs improving and there needs to be an increase in the number of checkpoints so you're not forced to restart literally everything again from scratch.

Graphically great, story is interesting, car combat is fun, the overall feeling is very Mad Max. There are maybe one or two tweaks I'd give it to make it feel a little more Australian, otherwise, this is solid as hell. All that worry about the PC version being heavily discounted before release (40% off in many cases), didn't mean this was a bad game. Infact, I don't know why they were discounting it so heavily.

            "review_text": "Forget the critics, this is an excellent game. Immersion is great; very faithful to the mad max universe. Stretch of desolate wasteland, vehicular combat with large displacement machines, twisted characters, constant scarcity of resources (not so much in game mechanic terms as it is thematically), pretty much all of the elements of a mad max movie are there. All of it is convincingly depicted via terrific audio and visual aesthetics. The desert feels hot and dry and electric storms feels dangerous. I'm no audiophile but the way the game audio adds an extra 'oomph' when max's fist connects with someones face is so damn satisfying, more so than many brawlers out there.   Speaking of brawling, the combat is pretty simple. It uses the same ol' single button attack another for counter system popularized by Batman Arkham series. Even though it can get tiresome if repeated too often, on foot combat portion is spaced out far enough that I personally had no issue with it. The previously mentioned brutal aesthetic of fights does alleviate the monotomy of it somewhat. Plus outside of clearing out fortications, you do have the option of simply running enemies over with a car.   The other part of combat is the vehicular combat. Vehicles control is good and as expected. Didn't say tight and responsive since different cars under different circumstance will expectedly exhibit varying degree of control and responsiveness. In fact, it's surprising to me how realistic the cars control considering how bad I thought the vehicles in Avalanche's Just Cause were. Granted, it's no Colin Mcrae Rally but it does a suffient job of convincing me that there's a car running on a solid surface. When the game is running on all 8 cylinders and you find yourself in the middle of a hostile convoy at full speed, it's a realization of the movie video game cliche of 'being in the movie' even if it's fleeting.   It's equally solid gameplay wise, even if it is not particularly original or innovative. Despite having nothing to do with Ubisoft, the game is actually pretty reminiscent of the typical Ubi open world games. You get to an observation point (maybe solve a simple puzzle) and reveal different cookie cutter activities in an area. And then there are 'strongholds' in the area you have to clear out to reduce influence of the hostile factions. Rinse and repeat. I think most of the negative reviews are based on this aspect of the game. And that criticsm isn't without warrant; it does make the game feel recycled. But I feel like there are so many other things that this game does right that that lack of originality in overarching game structure can be easily overlooked. In any case, the game is at least worth a try at ~$30 especially if you are a mad max fan.",

Great vehicle customization   Cons 1.Repetitive , can get boring trying too do all the side missions and camps and what not after awhile 2.Not enough variety in the magnum opus's body type: i found myself driving everything but the magnum opus whenever i could. all of the magnum opus's bodies were hot rod based. it'd be nice to choose between vastly different body types , like a van, truck, car, hell , even a coupe wouldve been cool. but this is a really trivial con. 3. unlock extra upgrades before unlocking story mode upgrades. if your a completionist and you 100% areas as you go along instead of coming back end game you'll find yourself getting the master unlocks before the scripted ones. 4. spoiler! you dont get the V8 engine until basically end of the game. 5. the dead ,brown and beige wasteland can get boringly repetitive to look at after awhile.  6. pure ambiance sound track: the majority of the sound track is ambiance, i wish the wasteland had a theme song of some sort , something calming and dead like to match the environment to keep me humming as i drive around.  most of these cons are minor issues I personally had but it didnt tarnish my experience that much.

The voice acting and plot are good, and it definately takes its lore from a mix of not only the new movie, but the old movies as well. The driving and controls feel fine, took a bit of getting use to with a Keyboard and mouse. The graphics are pretty damn good and the combat is basically Batman/Assassins creed style. You can even upgrade your character and level him up. And unlike that terrible Polygon review, I dont find the world lifeless at all, it has great character.",

Attempted to give water to a group in the desert, swerved, hit a rock, and murdered them all in a glorious flip. 10/10 - Would offer water again.  Buy if you enjoy:  -Fast paced combat on foot or in a car.  -Massive open worlds to explore  -A well constructed weapons and armor system  -Running people over  -An equally well constructed car upgrade system  -Blowing things up  -Or if you generally love causing mayhem.

If you, just like me, prefer inverted Y axis, and play with mouse and keyboard, you will find that the setting in menu do exactly nothing (at least, not for the mouse). Luckily you can circumvent this by editing the settings.ini file in tha game's main directory.  Look for: MouseInvertAimingY=0 Change it to: MouseInvertAimingY=1 Save the file and enjoy the game.  After 40 minutes, and finished the first story mission. The graphics are neat, and I have no frame rate problems with a mediocre, not-too-new graphics card. The game so far delivers the Mad Max feeling with decent voice overs. Driving seems to be enjoyable with keyboard. A new bug popped up though, but it's more of a nuisance than a real problem. The mouse pointer tends to remain visible during playing, but entering the menu (ESC) and resuming the game so far hid it again. Also a few footprints can 'blink' in the sand, but whatever.",

There is simply nothing significant to do unless you follow the story line. It's very much like Farcry where you are trying to capture key points. So overall, its open world, but definately not to the extent of something like Fallout or Elder Scrolls.  The items you find are pretty repetetive, scrap, ammo, weapons and that's about it. I wish there was more diversity in loot. There should be a lot more loot for customization that is not directly connected to the main story.  The graphics are adequate. The voice acting is VERY good. The characters are rememberable. It does not follow the Fury Road story but has the same War Boys as enemies. You are basically trying to get your car back.  It also has a slow-motion feature when pointing your weapons which is very useful when you are trying to shoot from your vehicle. You can target individual parts of vehicles too!   Lots of customization for the vehicles, but for character customization its not as free as many RPG's. Instead its limited to a 'level up' style. The previous upgrades you had are worthless for any purpose.  I put it's value at about $40. Right now I think it's over-priced but that's a personal opinion.",

Ground combat is good too and again max's skills can be upgraded. They havent reinvented the wheel by any means with this game as it borrows a lot from whats been done before (taking down strongholds is like in watch dogs, combat like AK, simillar playstyle to far cry etc). But it's a joy to play (if not a bit easy if you upgrade with griffa tokens (you'll probably never run out of water or ammo which makes it less of a survival in the desert game, which is part of the fun) and even then it aint that hard).   Overall The atmosphere of Mad max in a desert surviving on his wits against nutters is done well :)  Finished it now and thought it was a fairly well done story although kinda depressing though (lets hope the apocalypse never happens :) ) I didn't quite finish all the side stuff (90%) because it did start to drag a bit because there is so much to do, otherwise good fun.",

It plays very similarly to Shadow of Mordor as far as combat, movement is a little more limited but it doesn't take away from the game. The story line is good also, giving us the classic Mad Max type villan.   Con's - A lot of the game is based around car upgrades, which worked well but not as great as I was expecting. You need scrap (which is found all over the wasteland) to upgrade most of the vehicle parts (most of which don't come until you do repetative missions to reduce threat level in each region of the map). Once you do these missions you then need upwards of 1-2k scrap to fit your new gear. Most scrap piles offer 5-30 but you can get perks to upgrade this. This made me stop playing the game once I completed it however it doesn't take away from the main campain. If you are at all into gathering collectables and scavenging, this is defenitely the game for you.   Overall the game is what Mad Max fans have been looking for. It is very immersive, its has nice subtle references to the films and as the strory progresses you meet individual and memorable characeters.  Final Verdict - I would say the game is a solid 8/10. Combat and story is great, car customisation could do with a bit of work and the repetativeness toned down a little.",

This is a great Post Apocalyptic, Action, Open World in which you are constantly looking for ways to find scrap to upgrade your gear to take on the next bigger, badder, faster, enemy! Definitely recommend it to anyone who liked the movies and/ or enjoy playing hours on top of hours of RPG games to perfect your character (Max) and your ride (Magnum Opus). It is a bit grindy, but this type of game really is right down my alley. There is a bit of busy work, but I'm a perfectionist when it comes to clearing whole areas of a map an at a time, so it suites my play-style well.  The graphics and atmosphere are very well done. Character models aren't brilliant, but that's not why I play fun games. This is just a simple grinder RPG with brutal battles and a great look into the Mad Max universe.  I've put hours and hours into this game, and plan on spending much more time completing it in its entirety.",

            "review_text": "Is it a Harpoon simulator? It may be in the first half of the game but if it is, than its a good one. It is open world, you ve got a ton of upgrades to unlock through the countless activities and 'busywork' that is located all around the map. You fight on foot and in the car. Its a set of simple mechanics, which on foot rely mostly on your fists and in the car on tools like the harpoon, a sniper rifle, flamethrower or a bazooka like 'thunderstick'. This is it, and you do that over and over again.  Is the story good? Probably not. Its got some got elements and fits well in the Mad Max universe but overall its not that great. But then again, thats what Max is after.His car.Nothing else. Your goal is the upgrade that ride as well as your stats and your tools.Thats pretty much it.  However, it s a good game I stand behind that. If you dont like that game because you ve played too many titles with similar mechanics doesnt make the game bad.  Is it an above average / great game? No. Some of the issues like combat or invading camps do exist and are highly repetetive.  I paid around $20 for the game and thats what its worth for me. Totalbiscuit makes a very good point in that regard as it really comes down to what its actually worth for the individual.  Its a good game but not more than that. I agree with it having problems and that might indeed ruin the experience for some but calling it a bad game based on that isnt fair in my opinion. The mechanics / graphics and narritve are solid, fluid and well implemented. Some are average, some are better and some are worse, plus they ve been used before. Makes a good game. If its worth the money is up to you to decide.",

On only one occasion have I got the car completely stuck inbetween an ubreakable barrier, and another barrier that I did not have the capability of breaking. Part of it was my own foolish driving, and I was able to fast travel out of the location, so it did have a happy ending. Another thing is the punishing fall damage system. It seems Max will die even agily rolling off of a ten foot drop. That's the bad. The good out-weighs all of that, blowing it all out of the non-existant water. The melee combat is fluid and has a decent difficulty. The driving can feel clunky at times, but the excitement that goes along with bashing two cars together at high speeds just about overshadows that. The customization, while I don't have much to customize, looks extremely vast and feels like it makes a difference. There's plenty to do in each area, and the story keeps you engaged and interested in what's going to happen next.

            "review_text": "I have spent a little bit of time with the game and have just completed it. Overall, I would say it was a pleasant experience and I can and cannot see why critics gave it mediocre reviews. Below are the pros and cons I experienced during my time:  PROS -The game looks very, very good. The weather effects look awesome; the landscape is beautiful; the key characters have good detail. -The story gets pretty good, once you get to Gastown -- given all the criticism given to the game in regards to lack of story, makes me wonder whether critics just gave up on the game before getting to the climax portions. -The combat is fun and brutal -- if you like Batman style combat without any restraint on killing people, you will like this. I liked how the shotgun can be used during combat and how you could eliminate troublesome enemies quickly with it. -Overall, the car combat is quite fun and, once you get your rocket launcher (exploading harpoon), it becomes a blast -Using the harpoon on the Magnum Opus is very fun during car combat, as you can do lots of things, like pulling off the wheels of cars and harpooning land pedestrians and flinging them halfway across the map (Just Cause style) -The upgrade system for the car and Max are good, if not standard now for these kinds of games -Some of the setpieces and battles are pretty cool (e.g., going into an abandoned burried airport or church, with enemies surprising you in the dark) -The atmosphere is very bleak, which suits the character -The game ran well on my low end gaming PC. Optimized to a 'T'. -The voice acting was really good and I enjoyed Max's stern reserved hero characterization. The actor did quite well.  CONS -The majority of the gameplay revolves around doing very, very repetative missions. There are 4 major territories in the game, each with 4 sections with things that need to be cleared and scrap to be found. All the territory clearing missions consist of the same 5 types of missions (searching for mine fields, taking down totems, clearing bases, destroying a carravan of bad guys, or killing snipers) and random scrap bases. If you are like me, and like to try to get 100% clear in zones, you will find yourself getting worn out by the time you even get to Gastown. By hour 40, I was really slogging away, starting to get burnt out of doing the same things over and over again. This seems like really lazy gamplay design, and quite common for this genre. If it weren't for this aspect, I am sure the average critic review would have been over 8 easily. -Because of the above, the game has no replay value. Who would want to do all those same, boring, side missions again? There is no game + mode either. Once you are done with this game, you are most likely done. That said, I got 60+ hours out of the game, which isn't bad value. -The game is too easy. There was little challenge in the game, except for one racing mission. -The cars handle pretty poorly. For most of the game I didn't realize how poor the cars handled until a mission where I had to race on a real enclosed racing track. Then I realized that driving the car, even with all the upgrades in the game unlocked is like driving on ice. You will find that when you run over a rock or barely clip a wall your car will ALWAYS spin around, stop and face the opposite direction of the one you were facing previously. This can be pretty frustrating during races. -There is a notoriously bad racing mission in the game that comes out of the blue and took numerous tries to beat, not because it in itself was hard, but because the very poor car handling controls made it hard. -You need a controller for this game. From what I can tell, the game is pretty awkward using a keyboard and mouse. -There is basically no character development until you are almost done with the game. Probably the most regrettable flaw of the game is the lack of story throughout the game. The story content that is there is superb, but it only makes you realize how empty the rest of the game (the majority of the game) was. -There are bugs in the game. I found myself at times when trying to pick up scrapped warping through floors. Some climbing locations are not marked with yellow, like every other climbing location. Some scrap was not labled like every other. The UI suddenly disappeared sometimes. The fast travel and summoning Chumbucket was very inconsistent in working. And more. Overall, it was pretty smooth experience, but beware of bugs. -The sandstorms that randomly occur in the world are cool the first two times, as they look neat, kick your butt and are a great source for scrap. HOWEVER, the rest of the game they are super annoyance. They are annoying because you cannot fast travel while they occur and they take 10 MINUTES!!! So, if you are on your way to just complete a basic mission to clear a zone and sandstorm occurs, be prepared to just run around trying to live and wait it out. This became increasingly frustrating as I was trying 100% zones. Sometimes I would just come into the game and leave a base and it would immediately tell me beware of a sandstorm... if that occurs, just go back into the base or leave the game and come back in and the storm will be gone. -The day night cycle TAKES FOREVER! You probably won't notice the day/night cycle, except its aesthetics, for most of the game, until you get to two sidemissions that require you to do something at night and it is daytime. There is no way to speed up the clock and, if you log out, and come back, the cycle will be at the beginning of whatever part you were at previously. Thus, if you log out during the day, it will be morning. Therefore, the only way to get to these missions and make it night, is either go off and do something else in the game until it turns night or just sit there with the game out and check back later. Given that these missions occur near the end, and, if you had been clearing stuff out as you went along with little else to do, this will be a bit frustrating. -The combat was fun, but it didn't feel as smooth as some of the other Batman Arkham type games. -Some of the bleakness was a bit over-the-top, especially in regards to the 'relics' you find, which are pictures from the world prior to the apocalypse. For example, you will find a cheerful picture of a little kid with some stuff written on the back about the kid being turned into 'raspberry spray' and then Max will make some depressing remark about how we are in hell. I guess this fits the world he lives in, but the 'doom and gloom' of every comment does grate on you after hours and hours of play, especially once you start to realize that he is making the same comment over and over again with just new words. -There is car collecting in the game, but I didn't see the point of it, as every other car in the game pales in comparison to your main vehicle, as they don't have harpoons and the like. They tell you when you get in the car that you have some sort of stealth towards a faction, but it hardly works and usually as you drive past that faction, they will realize who you are in about 5 secs, if not before.   Though I do have a lot of negatives, and I probably wouldn't touch the game again in the future, I did have a fun experience and it was worth the discounted price I paid. The story at the end was pretty moving and and it saved the game from a lower score. I would probably give this game a 8/10, with the hope that it gets a sequel so they can try to resolve all the issues I listed above. If they made the game much more story centric and less rinse-and-repeat missions, it would be pretty amazing. If you are thinking about buying this game now, I suggest you wait and buy it on sale, as some places were selling it at 40% off at launch, which I image was because Warner Bros. just wanted to get the game out after all the trouble during the development cycle and figured it was going to bomb.",

Car combat is great, and the convoy chases and explosions feel straight out the film. Less faithful is the ground combat: Max can disinterestedly take out dozens of enemies with his bare hands, a stark contrast to the brutal ferocity that he would, in a more realistic way, need to focus on single enemies in the movies (yeah yeah, it's a videogame). You'll also never have to contend with mis-firing shotguns, and will almost always have ample fuel. As such, it's not The True Mad Max Experience, but at least give it points for coming close.",

Graphics are quite frankly the best ive seen in a open world game since GTAV (that alone is a very high praise). Recommended for those who loved the Mad Max original trilogy and Fury Road.",

After playing for 30 hours you kind of feel like only doing the camps and story because of how much scavenging there is. Overall I did enjoy the game and its setting, maybe in this case we could say that less is more though since the scavenging got too much of a hassle before the game was done. The game is definately better than average and you get plenty of content, but i wouldn't buy it full price and wait for some kind of sale.",

This game sits on its own playing field following the events of the movie mad max fury road in lore only, the game is its own entity with its own story and setting in the world of mad max apart from still being in Australia that is. The gameplay is solid and the mechanics of the game are fluid. If I had to describe mad max I would say it was like “Fallout” and “Just Cause” had a wild night together in the Australian outback; had a kid, then took that kid threw it into a rusted out shell of a car with a supped up V8 engine in it and a butt load of high explosive artillery in the trunk and said “go do whatever the hell you want to” and then threw that kid the keys! In Australia where everything is already trying to kill you at any piont and time, now we’ll add some crazed car driving nutjobs tweaked out from huffing gas fumes for the last three days and that want nothing more than to skin you alive and wear you like the latest fashion accessory from an L.A. designer runway show. The game gives you a car and says “Right now whatever gets in your way run into it, grind it, bash it, shoot it, blow it up, or harpoon it through the chest, and if that doesn’t work get out and pummel it into a bloody paste with your fists.

None of that is to the extent that the game isn't still a brilliant story, with a massive and living open world that runs extrodinarily well on mid level PCs.  If you are a fan of Mad Max, Fallout, Borderlands or open world games this is certainly worth a look. You can even watch some twitch gameplay which spoils story elements and NOT have the experience ruined because when you experience it, it will be different. (At least it certainly was for me).

I hope future movie based games take pointers from this one, by default any game based on a movie have always been poorly developed. This one raises the bar and then straps it to a rocket and launches it into space.  What more could you want? Amazing visuals, coupled with open world and smooth performance with very little bugs. I've spent hours in this game and the only problem I ran into was a little wonkiness in the garage menu but it was minor.  The combat system both on foot and in the car are very satisfying. The upgrade system on your car pushes you out into the world to gain more scrap just so you can have that extra boost/tweak to make your 'own' interceptor.  Get your video recording software ready on this one because the physics are top notch, you'll want to hit the record button just so you can relive the moment. I had a buggy heading right at me when the magnum opus was badly damaged, he hits a bump that launches him into the air a bit just as I was blowing up the car next to him. The explosion caused his buggy to explode which launched him into the sky like a rocket. Could'nt stop laughing....wished I had recorded it.  The story is decent but you actually end up exploring the world so much you tend to forget you're on one until you need that required part for your car. The world is really depressing and disgusting but yet beautiful at the same time. The capture mode system in this game is amazing, to be able to pause the game erase the HUD, adjust your camere settings/angle to take the perfect shot is something I hope future game developers implement into their games. Like I said, a lot can take pointers on the development of this game. Buy this game!    Pros: Amazing Visuals Flawless performance on max settings Engaging world and combat You're Mad Max...need I say more? Tons of elements from both the new and old Mad Max films. Impressive physics and explosions  Cons: That moment when you realize the end game is near. You spend so much time tweaking your own car, by the time you're rewarded the interceptor it seems subpar from the one you created. The V6 sounds meaner and louder than the V8, but that might just be my headset.",

Here is the main positives gist version: - The vast desert, strongholds, wrecks, open sand dunes, they all create a desolate world so sO SO worth exploring,  - Customization (both character and car) is off the charts for an open world title.  - Graphics range from above average to HOLY SHEET!, depending on the scenery. Overall it is truly eye-candy in terms of art direction and color palette, I honestly loved it. - Sound is sweet as hell if you have the appropriate sound system. With a 7.1, the gunshots, punches (Fury mode !!) and engine sounds were a true treat. Obviously hearing authentic australian accents is a plus too:) - Car/fist fights. The core of the game. And yes, AAA action game/movie caliber. I dare anyone to dispute this.  - And last, but not least: it runs like a dream. Seriously. Knife through butter kind of smooth. This is how games are supposed to ship in the first place, so take note everyone else. But nevertheless, Avalanche did a stand up job here!  The story is passable, but then again, I did not expect Witcher/Mass Effect complexities in the 1st place. It is simple, with a few turns here and there. Enjoyable. I might have expected a bit more variation in the side quests or available stranger stuff, but I honestly cannot fault this game for that, as practically every other open world has the same, if not worse issues. No biggie, its the story + setting + options that count. And in this, Mad Max truly succeeds. My darkhorse for 2015 is exactly that. Bravo !  ",

Textures, lighting, particle effects (smoke/fire/explosions) are all top notch.  • The car combat is fun as hell and the best part about this game in my opinion.  Cons:  • The story itself is a bit dull and predicatble. The only real choice you get to make in this game is what side quests you want to do. The main story is very much on rails and a bit uninspired.  • No interesting antagonists! All of the bosses in every zone are the same character with different paint jobs (big brute, heavy weapon, lots of health).  • The caravans are kind of fun to take down, but they just drive in a loop/circuit instead of actually transporting something from point A to point B, which I think would have been a bit more immersive.",

With the game, I first noticed that it was developed by Avalanche Studios, a swedish game studio known for Just Cause-series. One of the absolutelty best Open World experience there is. So with the Mad Max game, I get the best of two worlds, being able to play and live as Mad Max and enjoy the wasteland as an open world.  My first experience with Mad Max was with TotalBiscuits PC-Port Report, and after that I decided to get the game.   So after a +25h of gameplay I am very glad that I did purchase the game, because it is really worth every little $$$ spent on it. The game is so rich of content, even if some may find it very repetitive, but I love it. I love Open World and I love exploring. The graphics is really amazing, and I can't wait for Just Cause 3. Even if I run the game with a 660 TI OC, I can still cramp up the graphics quality. I run smoothly at 60FPS.   The gameplay itself I find very enjoyable, I fínd a good balance between fighting with vehicle and fighting on foot. I love the fact that it really takes time to save up scrap (money). It is really amusing to just drive around and doing silly stuff or just waste time. I do agree that the story telling aint that strong, compared to other games, but I don't really see that is what Avalanche Studios wanted with this game, they wanted a beautiful Open World game with so much content instead. It wouldn't even surprise me if this was a intended joke, to other games in the genre.   It is above average, it is, but for me, I really do enjoy it, and I do not regret buying this game at all. It is worth all it's money.",

Assassins Creed was a game I loved for the first two hours and hated the next 4 until I found myself not wanting to play it at all anymore. I didn't get this game for the reason of that and after watching some streams the game just looked like it might be great for killing time. Turns out I love it and even though I hated the rinse and repeat of AC towns, I find 77 hours later still loving the game.  Pros The three button combat is so well done I actually forget that it really isn't my style of action game. The driving and harpooning people just never gets old. So much upgrades and side quests to take hours, but most of the stuff not really required. Optimization, the game runs so smooth and I think that is the second biggest reason why combat is so fun.  Graphics and storms really look sharp overall.  Cons Mine fields (they just are so boring, but the plus is I haven't seen where they are required to do). Can get to overpowered if you find yourself enjoying the game and doing everything. A glitchy instant death. (2 times in 77 hours I have died twice to some sort of bug, the first was getting out of my car while on a little boulder and the second was doing a arm bar style move that I went up into the air and fell to my death.)   Overall I have 77 hours in and had the game a week. About 20 hours is probably AFK time to be honest. Some of it is just because I was trying to see if I got scrap faster while AFK versus offline and I didn't notice a difference to be honest. And the other is just the main menu running in the back ground while I stepped away.   I can't give you a score for you, but for me it is a 10/10. The game draws me in and the other night I started playing at 6 PM and before I knew it was midnight. Decided I wanted to finish up what I was doing and one thing led to another and it was 2 AM.

            "review_text": "Amazing sandbox game and I'm hooked, not immediately but gradually as the story unfold and the world opens up. I started off as a skeptic of this game, thinking i might have wasted money for a mediocre action game, as many movie based games are. At first glance, the graphics seemed a bit primitive at close up. Character models, furnitures and buildings are somewhat low polygon but serviceable. The open world felt inaccessible at first and many fun things are hidden from plain sight. But as i played on, i began to explore the nooks and crannies of this barren wasteland, and taking part in all the activities the game has to offer like car races, convoy raids, base takdowns, mine sweeping with Max's dog etc., and just surviving in the vast open world, i started to become one with Max and his car. Without a doubt, the outdoor environment and car combat are the highlights of this game. And when you spend a lot of time on the road by yourself with your car in a hostile environment, the world and the road began to take on a dangerous and personal outlook as crazies from the apocalypse start to scream at you chasing you off the road with their modded cars complete with spikes.   There is a lot of survival things you can do on your own in this game, such as finding water, food, gasoline and scraps in various camps that dot the map, or more dangerously by clearing out random caves or enemy bases populated by menacing enemies, some with red glowy eyes that looks especially menacing at night. The unarmed enemies on foot are generally not a match for Max but i still find myself in more than a few tight spots early in the game, as ammo is scarce in this game and you can quickly become outnumbered and surrounded by your enemies. Some even wield knives that are unblockable and can only be dodged. They would attack you when you are busy fighting the unarmed ones and do a lot of damage. Later on in the game you will fight enemies armed with shields and heavy weapons, which are deadly and even more so combined with dozens of unarmed ones that constantly harass you making you fight them while the heavily armed one charges you with unblockable attacks. There are even suicide bombers. In short, melee combat can be quite intense and challenging. These enemies don't wait around and take turns to have a swing at you like in Shadow of Mordor, they come at you all at the same time and they want you dead. For your character to level up and unlock new gears, you have to do missions or favors for NPCs and side quests, gears like jacket/armor to enhance your health, wrist guard to enhance your blocking power, ammo belt for extra ammo and shivs, and new fighting moves to help you in melee combat, which you definately need as enemy grows stronger. There is also a whole range of upgrades for your car such as tires, suspensions, engines, spikes, grappling hook, sniper rifle, flamethrower/sideburner etc.. The detail in this game is very deep and not at all apparent for people who only plays the game for a short amount of time.   I truely feel immersed and living the life of a wasteland wanderer, maybe more so than even the last fallout game could deliver. Fallout always felt small in terms of scope, but the world of Mad Max is huge and truely menacing but also eerily beautiful. At least for me i now see the Mad Max franchise becoming a strong contender to the fallout franchise in the post-apocalyptic genre. In the future, I hope they make Max completely customizable (name, appearance, voice etc.) so that we can create our own version of him/her, games like mass effect, fallout and knights of the old republic all have a market version and player versions of the main character, even the latest metal gear solid is allowing players to create their own solid snake, so i don't see why it can't be done.   My favorite thing to do is exploring the wasteland on my trusted Magnum Opus, complete with its hunchback mechanic that can repair your car even from near-explosion. With a press of a button, he would climb from the back of the car over the roof to the front hood. And it is quite amusing to watch him work from the driver's view :D The game is 3rd person while you are on foot and on wheels, but there is a very versatile 1st person driver view, and i frequently use it during open world exploration, car races, and even during car combat to get that full-on immersion ie. shooting your shotgun from your window during car chase at close range with the help of the game's slow-motion system for aiming. I can see myself continue to play this game after finishing the main story if the game permits it. I will certainly be a customer when they release DLCs for this game. And i hope they introduce a playable female character in one of the DLCs. It is quite an achievement how the game manage to faithfullly recreate the world of Mad Max from the movies and especially from Fury Road. The Cars, the enemies and the eerily beautifully desolate world in the game, they all look and feel like a natural extention to the films. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the game has day/night cycle and full weather system complete with its own thunderstorms and sandstorms that come and go as they please. I have never experienced something quite like the storms in this game. Watching a huge 100 feet tall and miles wide storm front catching up on you from your rear view mirror as you zoom across the barren landscape in your fast car looking for shelter was quite the jaw-dropping experience. Nuances like these are like icing on a cake for making the game world feel that much more alive and menacing.",

If you are playing in hopes of a lasting and meaningful world with lots of interesting things to do, dont bother. I wouldn't buy this game unless it is on sale otherwise you may just feel cheated out of your money. ",

            "review_text": "This is more of a first impressions review, but I am loving this game so far. I'm just gonna give a brief rundown of the game, and what I think about each section. At time of writing I have put 5.4 hours into the game.  Performance/Graphics On max settings, this game looks gorgeous. Now my rig could handle it at first, but once the world opened up a little more I did start to experience some slowdowns, but just dialing some settings back I could keep it at high resolutions with 60fps+ and it still looks great. Overall, really well optimized, but make sure you have the hardware for the higher settings.  Gameplay The gameplay on-foot isn't as good as in a vehicle, but it's still good, but it's not great. The melee combat is good, but I still wish they could've used a different system other than the FreeFlow. It works, and it's pretty simple to use and it is satisfying with the animations and the sound effects. And the vehicle combat is fantastic. Just the vehicles in general are amazing. With the customization and the way they handle, it's so much fun and it makes them a necessity in the game just like they are in the world. There is no handbrake, but I'm okay with that.  Sound I love the sound effects and what I've heard of the soundtrack so far. It's right up my alley with the heavy guitars and drums and all that good stuff. It's very similar to the movie soundtrack, so if you liked that, you'll love this too. Cars sound gorgeous and the guns sound good, but they could have more punch to them. Overall, the sound is good, although I did have a bug where Max stuttered on one of his lines for a second or two, then it was fine.  Bugs Speaking of bugs, I've seen two so far in the 5 hours that I've been playing. One was the sound glitch I mentioned already, and another where the cutscene froze for a second, but then it caught back up and it was fine. Like I said, performance was great and I haven't seen any other bugs that I can remember.  Overall This game so far is really well put together. My only issue with it is that there is a fair amount of grinding to get some of the car parts/Max's gear and it takes more grinding on top of that to afford the parts. But that's taken a little bittersweet, because that means you get to do more of the combat and traveling around and exploring to get the currency for these upgrades. I'm having a blast with it so far, and if you have any doubts about getting it, it's worth the $60 in my honest opinion. And I can see myself playing it even after I beat the main story, and perhaps even going for 100% completion for it.",

            "review_text": "  Fantastic open world game by Avalanche Studios, made with the license of Mad Max Fury Road (the new one with Tom Hardy). The game looks great while running at a stable 120fps on max settings. The game sounds fantastic (especially the motors/exhausts and explosions) and has good audio settings (device, speaker type, dynamics). The vehicular combat is innovative (deeper than RAGE) and fun. Melee combat is Arkham style but a bit harder since you can't automatically parry every direction and the camera is a bit closer, you need to actually press the direction + parry button, which means you shouldn't get surrounded. Voice artist for main sidekick 'Chumbucket' is amazing, sounds just like the movie. I wish the game had more vehicular combat, as the regular combat is kinda boring.  Similar to Shadow of Mordor, the wonder wore off after some repetition. I 100% cleared the first area, 80% cleared the second, ~40% cleared the third and don't give a rats ♥♥♥ about the fourth. There are strongholds in each area and you can unlock buildings there which replenish your resources, but unlocking this multiple times is too much of a hassle. I'd rather fast travel to a fully upgraded stronghold and then fast travel back to another one. It's unfulfilling that most of the income is passive through unlocked camps. The only other big income are Scrapulances (special rare vehicles full of scrap which have to be driven to a stronghold) and scrap pallets during storms. Both of these are unreliable. The scrap rewards during normal gameplay do not scale. This is ok since scaling rewards would be unrealistic and wouldn't work that well with an open game world. The passive income scales naturally, but this also means that it eclipses all other sources of scrap.  Is this a design weakness or a design strength? I've played so much that I don't want to pick up every single piece of scrap. The camps got repetitive, so I stopped doing those. I'm a bit disappointed in the boss fights, they're very simplistic and samey. I'd rather have had more vehicular boss fights than melee ones.  I'm giving it a thumbs up since it's great during the first third and it's normal for games in this genre to get repetitive after a while. For my taste, these games should be shorter, but there have to be people who like the 'extra content'. ",

            "review_text": "Mad Max is a very polarizing game. Although the Metascore is very solid, the individual critic reviews can range from positive to negative. But I've never found myself more satisfied by and more addicted to a game than Mad Max! This game, in a nutshell, is 'scrumptious', and you'll come back for more if you love open world games that have lots of objectives to fulfill.  Here's a summary of the positives (+) and negatives (-) so far, which will be added to as gameplay time goes on:  + Extremely well optimized and beautiful. This is one of the very few games that won't make your PC feel substandard and ancient if you had mid range hardware. Breathtaking all around, with a few average textures here and there that barely hurt the visuals. It's smooth as butter, with an excellent selection of video options.  + Very cool progression system. Leveling up in Mad Max is a joy filled with lots of fun rewards! His appearance even evolves over the course of the game!  + 'Car porn' are two words to describe Mad Max. There's a ton of customization and ways to make your vehicle truly yours. Vehicle combat is high octane and adrenaline pumping, but only after you unlock higher level harpoons and other weapons!  + Excellent characters that are often quite interesting, especially a few of the main characters and villains. Chumbucket is funny, and a charming companion for your journey. Griffa has an excellent aura of mysticism and mystery.  +/- The game IS a collect-a-thon, but is that a really bad thing? It encourages exploration around the various beautifully desolate locales. Yeah, it's not like Banjo Kazooie or something of the sort, but I don't understand why this aspect of open world games is considered so bad. Maybe to critics who tend to hate random busywork, it's bad, but for the average gamer who loves to fill up meters to 100%, collecting is quite fun in Mad Max! Many items actually affect things, such as scrap which is used as currency.  +/- Ground combat can be a mixed bag. I personally enjoy it a lot. The sound effects have impact, especially when your fist meets the faces of your many foes, but the cinematic combat is really just two or three buttons you push the whole time. Is that a bad thing? Perhaps, but it feels satisfying as hell to see how one button can cause so many varied and cinematic attacks to appear on screen. I don't agree that it's better than let's say, Devil May Cry, but I do like how it aggregates fancy combos into one button, and it's always fun to parry attacks then counter at the right time. Special finishers, weapons, and moves help add flavor to it.  - Ran into at least one gamebreaking bug that forced me to shut the game off, and the other bugs are minor. The most useful and strange bug caused enemies to vanish entirely during battle. Mostly random encounters on the road.  - There might be TOO MUCH to do, it's easy to get sidetracked for hours on end, spoiling the narrative flow. If you want to get to the heart of Mad Max, you'll have to skip a lot of the side content which makes up a majority the game in general.  - Some side objectives are repetitive as hell, but somehow I still enjoy them. But the game does indeed borrow heavily from other open world games... especially the 'vantage points'.  - Game does tend to lose performance in some car battles, or when there's a large number of enemies on the screen. Dense areas will lose some performance.  - Car combat is weak at the beginning of the game.  - Progression on Max, and his vehicle, is very linear. There is no reason to choose previously unlocked equipment... but baffingly, you can, which hurts your stats. Some vehicle customization options will lower stats, such as top speed or acceleration, giving some depth to it, but there is zero repercussions for using any upgrade for Max.  - The thunderpoon is an overpowered car weapon that is the definition of 'dominant strategy'... in the end game. There is no reason to use the awkward harpoon or any other weapon when you can just one hit kill every enemy vehicle with a fully upgraded thunderpoon.  - The currency, Scrap, becomes pointless in the end game. There is no reason to aquire it besides for fun when everything is upgraded and bought.",

I am running nearly 'max'ed out everything setting wise and it still seems to run smooth and is is GORGEOUS. There is an occasional blip when it loads a new area but not very often. Load times are short and I love that in a game. The combat is fluid, much like the batman games. So much fun to fight with because it is so smooth and intuitive. The Car and Character customization are great. They are super creative and stay very true to the theme. The characters in the game are much like the original movie's as well. By that I mean that they are outlandish in their banter and dress. Over the top and exotic was always a theme in the movies and it is well portrayed in the game. If you were curious if it sahres a story with the new movie, it does not. The characters look similar as far as the 'warboys' go but that is where it ends. So no this is not a movie game. So far I have had two hicups that have hurt the gameplay experience. Once, I got out of a car and my character flew into the air and died. I tried to replicate this but to no avail. As well, I had the UI glotch out once and my obkectives didnt update. Aside from those to little things that were easily corrected by rebooting the game, this game is great.

Having paid full price on pre-order, I still feel that I got most of my money's worth out of it in enjoyment. That being said, if you get the game on discount you will probably feel better about the purchase afterwards.   The themes of post-apocaliptia, scavenging for limited resources and exploring the ruins of a bygone era all things that appeal to me as a fan of the Mad Max world. The added bonus of vehicular mayhem with a somewhat customizeable car certainly adds alot of potential fun factor.  What this game does right:  - Stylistic atmosphere and graphics (lighting, smoke effects, wind and dust, explosions... good stuff)  - Crazy car vs. car combat with limited adherence to real world physics makes for a fun arcade feel  - Varied, but not overly difficult ground combat, with multiple ways (with skill upgrades) to eliminate enemies in gloriously brutal fashion  - Colorful and interesting NPC character models  - Varied enemy types and their respective combat techniques and day/night appearance of alternate enemies keeps fights from feeling overly repetitive  - Making each location to explore unique enough that the numerous 'fetch-quests' give you reason to really explore the open world provided without it growing too stale  - Opportunity to race your car in 'Death Races'  - Mostly good in-game engine cutscenes  - 60fps highly optimized PC Port (with minor menu flubs)  Where this game falls short:  - This game is crazy easy for any mildly experienced gamer  - No pressure for survival as all resources are abundant and/or need is completely nullified through game progress  - Limited story provides no real opportunity to become attached to main character or any NPC  - Apart from achievement, no reason at all to do 'Death Races' since rewards are nil/laughable  - Mixing and matching car upgrades is pointless... best is best, period  - In-game currency of 'scrap' is so abundant and easy to acquire that intermediate character and car upgrades could easily be bypassed for top quality gear too early in gameplay providing no feel of progression  - Limited or no tutorialistic explanation of simple game elements (how to quickly abort a failed race run or progress in the story) leads to avoidable web-searching frustration  - Major bosses feel extremely 'cookie-cutter' in a boring way  - One really stupid and nonsensical cutscene (if you play, you'll see it)  Overall, the game had a fair balance of pros &amp; cons that neither made nor ruined the game for me. Play this game for the atmosphere and the arcade style simplicity. Don't play this game for the story or the survival aspect. This is a casual game with ZERO replayability. Purchase with hefty discount is reccomended.",

Now add wide open areas like in shadow of mordor only completly trash any element of any climbing engine besides climbing things that are yellow (there is literally one stronghold location that has lines painted on the rock formations for you to climb). Now add a few good things like the storms and the convoy (from farcry 2). Now the main character have him start off as a shirtless guy in olveralls and have him be upgraded to the point he looks like a reject from duck dynasty. Now take the strongholds from red faction and nerf the destruction in it till it is simplistic and last but not least change one of the giant warcheif from shadow of mordor into a human being and make him the antagonist. you pretty much have a somewhat fun game but becoems bland in a while.",

The game takes place after some sort of apochalypse, so all the oceans have dried up (Don't ask me how, but that's just how it is) and you are just driving around in the desert looking for fuel to your car, the Interceptor. As you are out to refuel your car a huge bodybuilder with a rhino horn pen*s and a chainsaw staff called  ''Scabrous Scrotus''  appeared with his big @$$ car the  ''Land Mover''  and stole the Interceptor. You jump onto the Land Mover just as it drives away and try to get it back, stabs Scrotus with his own chainsaw staff in the head, get thrown off the Land Mover, and then you have nothing to do but to walk, then all of a sudden you find someone called  ''Chumbucket''  that promise you to make a car for you, he calls that car the  ''Magnum Opus'' . And as the game goes along, you keep upgrading the Magnum Opus until it become a fortress on wheels. The game is focused a lot on car combat, you can ram, grind burn, shoot and pull your enemies in it, and the game has got great ground combat too, it's practically the exact same as in the Batman: Arkham franchise.   More game developers need to learn how to optimize their games properly, in this game we have seen EXACTLY how good well-optimized games can run and still look beautiful. In my rig I have a GTX 660 (For those who don't know what it is, a 3 year old mid-range video card, which isn't that great) and i can still run this game smooth as butter (constant 60fps) on high graphic setting.  The game really looks great, while driving around in the wasteland you get the feeling of having dust in your mouth.  If you like Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor you will definitely LOVE this game. The gameplay is prectically the same but better in my opinion.  I give this game 10/10, because everytime I play it I have a great time, and that's what I think all games should be like.",

            "review_text": "OK, I haven't played enough to do an in-depth review of it, but I have a couple concerns about this game that arose in the veeeery earliest missions:     Evidently, the Australian Wasteland is coated with black ice, butter, and banana peels, because that's what it feels like to drive on it. Mildly tight turns might as well be Lombard Street.    Starts off...oddly. After playing the MGSV prologue, I guess my expectations were a bit high from the get-go, but it definitely feels rushed.    Fighting feels competent, if a little boring. It definitely feels like you're actually hitting people hard, rather than giving them little love taps.    WHY THE F**K IS MAX TALKING SO MUCH? It seems like, in trying to adapt him into a video game character, they've kinda lost, like, one of his only character traits. In this, so far, he seems to be '3rd person action hero #7' rather than Max Rocktansky. I can see where they're coming from, but not many people have a problem with Chelle or Gordan Freeman, so I don't know why Max needs so many lines of dialogue.    The port here is  excellent . I simply  cannot  get it to run below ~120fps with everything set to the Max. I do have a GTX 980 and a 4790K, so it wasn't gonna run badly  anyway , but Avalanche did a seriously good job with this one, which I guess is to be expected at this point from them.    The devs seem very keen on adding mini cutscenes for things that didn't need them (e.g. putting gas in the back of the car, drinking water, and eating food.) It makes the whole flow of the game feel very disjointed, especially since the game fades to black whenever one of them ends. I don't understand why they couldn't just have that stuff be a part of gameplay.   So, I'm gonna finish this off with a table, and will be updating my score with time played, so you can see how it grows on me.       Time Played   Score/10         45 min.    6/10 (above average, but nothing to write home about)     3 hours    7.5/10 (actually pretty enjoyable, and definitely above average.)    ",

You're Max and everyone is relying on you weather you want them to or not. Ya gotta fight for everything and the rewards are small just to get you by. The landscap is vast and in ruin. Open world, ya can drive anywhere. There is a big emphasis on driving. Car chases. Sometimes you are the pursuer, sometime the pursuee. You can slow down the car chases by aiming the harpoon attached to the car while ya rotate the camera and soak in all that action. Graphics are great. They got the dust down. Feels like it is in your teeth. Nothing cooler than being on a clifftop looking through binoculars at enemy vehicles driving down the road as you watch them. There are sand storms that will kill ya making you panic to find shelter. Fighting mechanics are good-great and it really feels like you are crackin some skulls when 12 of them attack you at once. Want to take out the shotgun between punches? Go ahead and send that dude flying. Pick up a bat and really make em hurt. The game is fair. No where did I feel like I was being cheated or something was out of place.. Bosses are beatable and fair. It is a long game to get through everything. The only gripe I have is Max cannot kneel. He always stands. There are tons of photo moments of Max staring out into the wastland, they shoulda let him kneel. I recommend this game. 9/10",

If there was one thing that could use an improvement it is the story. It's not very gripping nor it gives you any real motivation to push forward. Honestly i've spent most of my time on exploration and vehicle combat than anything else. However to it's credit, it ends in a way Mad Max movies end and that's fine. Don't listen to all the people complaining how 'anti-climactic' the ending is. If you watched the movies you should know what to expect, but i digress.

        {
            "review_text": "I've already wrote a brief review of this title on reddit, but I'll expand more on here...  ---  Mad Max is probably one of the most optimized PC games. Lots of graphical options to tune, and maintains a nice fps in nearly any setup. A thing to note is that under Audio there's a setting to turn on Fury Mode, which amps all the sounds in the game. It's not so that it's louder but everything's much more furious and raspier, as the mode is named with. I'd recommend trying it out as it gives the game a much more grittier feel.   In terms of looks the game looks stunning. It's a treat to even drive around the region. And those sandstorms - they're pretty intense! It's even crazier than FO4's rad storms!  In terms of gameplay it's a little repetitive. I'd compare it to JC3 because in Mad Max you're basically reducing Scrotus' and Stank Gum's influence in each region, much like in JC3 where you reduce the DRM's influence. However Mad Max does it a bit better because there's a number of ways to reduce influence, whether it's taking down oil wells, removing scarecrows, or removing convoys off the map.  Other stuff you can do is take out scarecrows, take out snipers, blow up Buzzard lairs, find high-value cars (for some reason these aren't explicitly tracked), build Archangels (basically special variants of your main car that require certain upgrades to build), do Death Runs (sort-of like races but with twists), and so on. Basically there's a lot of stuff to do. As of this review I'm still not done. So in terms of replayability there's a good amount. But I doubt I'll be repeating another playthrough, as the story itself is very linear.   Vehicular combat isn't very common in games these days, but Mad Max gets it right. Eliminating convoys for example are surprisingly lots of fun. And you have plenty of tools to take them out, like the Harpoon or the Thunderpoon (aka a rocket launcher). Outside of convoys you'll run into War Boys or Stank Gum itching for a fight, but sometimes they won't even chase you, either because you're too fast or they won't bother. These guys don't seem to provide very much loot, so it's better to ignore them.   Speaking of combat there's also on-foot combat. That means that you can upgrade Max, so you can spend your Scrap on more skills or better gear. Now onto combat: It's a bit like Batman, but isn't. Meaning there's no actual flow to it. Max can enter Fury which boosts his attacks, but it doesn't introduce anything jaw-dropping. There's also different archetypes of enemies which spices things up but you still throw the same punches. Top Dogs act as bosses but they all seem to have the same moveset and weapon.  I honestly thought there was gonna be combat where Max would get out of his car, climb onto the roof and fend off the guy next to him. A bit like in the movie Fury Road. Abit disappointed there wasn't one.   The story is good but not groundbreaking or anything. Max himself is almost like a silent protagonist and takes favors as long as he gets something in return. There's also Wasteland missions but those are basically fetch quests. The characters you meet are interesting (like Gutgash) but they aren't that developed (however their respective Wasteland Missions expand on their intent). The history relics you find in the world tell sad tales of the past and how it became as it is now. Max commentating on the relics are a nice touch (some of what he says are surprisingly profound). There's also Wasteland encounters you find when you explore the wasteland. Most of those are just jargon that you already knew, but some of them can provide Intel to help in taking a difficult camp. But there's the odd encounter or so that made me pretty depressed, really bringing out that it's really the end of the world.   Much of the upgrades in this game don't seem very worth it, especially the Griffa tokens. Mostly because the game is inherently easy. Though once you unlock the northen region the game gets much tougher, while the southern region is exceptionally easy.  Plus in spite of being a post-apocalyptic game there aren't many hardcore or survival aspects. Max doesn't get hungry or thirsty, so eating food or drinking your canteen only heals you. And fuel is plentiful and declines slowly enough to not worry about (there is a weapon that uses fuel though).   Each region has a Stronghold that houses the main guy of that region, like Jeet or Deep Friah, as well as their followers. You can improve these places by setting out and finding project parts to construct Water Storages or Maggot farms. These projects provide Max instant full water or instant full ammo when you enter the Stronghold, as well as improving the looks of the place. While the projects do make searching for water or gas redundant, bear in mind that there's a time limit after you get your stuff, so it kinda forces you to go out and find more sources. Of course that only affects the Stronghold you've entered. Additionally some projects are unavailable until you've done the main guy's Wasteland missions.  The game's 'currency' is Scrap, and you find it pretty much anywhere. You can earn them through clearing camps, so allies can populate 'em to deliver you Scrap every once of a while. You can also find them in places that you can loot, off of cars you take out, and so on. There's even a project in the Strongholds that adds Scrap when your game is off! Essentially it doesn't really run out. Of course you spend the Scrap on upgrades or improving Strongholds. However a lot of the upgrades require prerequisites to be done first. This can be like doing Wasteland missions or achieving a certain level.  Speaking of levels, you can gain more levels by completing Challenges. I don't personally track 'em but getting upgrades that require a certain level take some time. Fortunately the bulk of the Challenges come pretty naturally so they don't become a huge chore.   All in all Mad Max is a great PC title that's optimized and has pretty engaging gameplay. In terms of story I'd say it's decent but it isn't Undertale or anything.     Recommend?  If you want a nicely optimized PC title, yes.  If you want good vehicular combat, yes.",

Fortunately, they don't make up a majority of playtime, but since (as you'd expect) the game ends with one, it's pretty anticlimactic. Secondly, and a slightly bigger problem, the difficulty scales poorly. Early in the game, with not much of a car, no skills, and weak attributes, survival is a real struggle. By late game, you're a superpowered killing machine. The sweet spot between the two is vanishingly small, though. It may work out better if you don't (as I did) complete a lot of optional side quests along the way, or if you leave them for the end.

The developers made each of the regions look distinct and they are crammed with stuff to do: places to loot, camps to take apart, scarecrows to pull down, snipers to neutralize, and so forth. You also get to upgrade friendly strongholds, whose inhabitants will slowly go from utterly despising you to pointing you out to their friends as your legend grows. The story is interesting and there are a wealth of side missions to go on.   Hand-to-hand combat is a simplified version of the battle system found in the Batman: Arkham games, with one button to strike and one button to counter. You also have a shotgun and can pick up melee or throwable weapons off the ground. Along the way, you will upgrade Max and be able to pull off special finishing and counter moves that add variety to the combat, which otherwise moves along at a steady clip.   The main feature of the game is, of course, your car. The black-on-black gets stolen at the beginning of the game, but Max gets a new friend (Chumbucket) who want to build a new car called the Magnum Opus. As you level up Max and engage in various missions, you will be able to unlock new upgrades for the car that can be installed if you have enough scrap to pay for them. The car is as much a character in the game as Max, Chumbucket, and any of the other people in the game. It is also a delight to drive this vehicle around the wasteland and use its harpoon to take down gates or, with the 'thunderpoon' upgrade, make opposing vehicles explode.   All in all, this is really a terrific experience that has kept me capivated from the moment that I first started playing. The game looks gorgeous and runs great, and it's the closest thing to actually being in one of the Mad Max movies. I really recommend that you give this game a go.  Edit: I have finished the game and must admit that the last two or so story missions have soured the experience a bit for me. I don't want to spoil the story, but let's say that the ending doesn't really fit what we've seen of Mad Max in the movies. Once the final cutscene played out, I was dropped back in the wasteland, but I had zero interest in continuing to play and ended up uninstalling instead. Still, I really enjoyed the 40 hours I spent cruising the desert and would still recommend the game. I don't see myself replaying it again, though -- at least, not for a long while.",

I have only experience about 3 sandstorms in my time playing. And i have done alot. Have cleared the whole bottom half of the map in Jeet and Gultash's territory. So i have done a fair but, but am not experiencing a main aspect of this game. The graphics look beautiful, Combat is so FUN and well thought, Alot of customization, Story is long and gripping and most importantly, it is very well ported. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10. Only thing it lacks in my opinion to enjoy the game is sandstorms. Highly recommend this game!",

If there was one thing that could use an improvement it is the story. It's not very gripping nor it gives you any real motivation to push forward. Honestly i've spent most of my time on exploration and vehicle combat than anything else. However to it's credit, it ends in a way Mad Max movies end and that's fine. Don't listen to all the people complaining how 'anti-climactic' the ending is. If you watched the movies you should know what to expect, but i digress.

            "review_text": "First things first: this is a great game. Some of the critics gave this game average reviews, which I think was undeserved. The gameplay seems to draw in elements from lots of different third-person open world games in a way that really works. The game itself is beautiful and really easy to get immersed in. If you play for long enough you really get that feeling of bleakness and despair driving around the wasteland.  That being said, some of the complaints for this game are fair. I'm going to point some of these out because if they make a sequel, I hope they improve on some of these aspects:  -The customization is bad. The game sort of markets itself on giving you the ability to create your very own Magnum Opus. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of customization options when it comes to designing the look of your car. You can mix and match different upgrades, but for the most part the cosmetic options are pretty limited. For a Mad Max game, this is pretty bad.  -Some of the side missions are repetitive and monotonous. Throughout the game you have to clear out camps, scarecrows, minefields, etc. in order to reduce the threat level in the different areas. Some of these can be pretty fun, but some of them, such as the minefields, can be pretty tedious. A lot of the car upgrades require that you reduce the threat level a lot, so you will be forced to do a lot of these if you want the best upgrades.  -The story really only picks up during the second half of the game, mostly at the end. Sure, there are little side stories when you go to the individual strongholds, but they're not very in depth. For a vast majority of the game there's not a whole lot of story elements going on, you're mostly running around and taking care of side missions, clearing out camps, scavenging, etc.",

        {
            "review_text": "This is one of those games that's great but leaves you wanting more. The game itself looks great, runs great, is genuinely fun and is generally free from bugs. The few that were there at release were taken care of quickly. It immerses you in the world of post apocalyptic Australia really well where the only thing in abundance is blood and oil. Even remembered to make the cars right-hand drive. Max out your graphics if you can and you'll forget it's a game and not a movie during the amazing looking cutscenes. It's one of those games that is so good that it feels way too short. It's just a linear story with a few missions but with a serious jump in difficulty between each one since you're meant to build your car and yourself up in between them. If you're that hardcore you can bulldoze your way through the main story in half a day but if you're a completionist who doesn't want to fight the last boss without having your car and Max be as badass as possible then it is going to take awhile. It has really nice feeling driving of course as well as a surprisingly satisfying melee combat system. There's sniping and racing and bomb defusing with your bomb disposal dog. It has strongholds that are tough to fight your way through and have a collectathon feel to finding all the hidden collectables and there are no hints to guide you. Not just that though as you can collect most of the cars in the game by simply taking it and driving it home. I don't usually approve of DLC but I would really love some more things to explore, cars to drive, and more customization for the hero car. It gives a lot of freedom in how you can play. You can build a car for ramming or grinding or speed and eventually all of the above. Make a lowered speed demon or a lifted rat rod or something in the middle. It's not like a racing game where you just blindly upgrade it though as most mods add in one aspect but equally subtract in another. Also for maximum immersion play with headphones with the volume maxed out so you can properly enjoy your eardrum shattering exhaust. The two downsides I see to this game are the high price and that once you beat the game there isn't a new game plus or anything. You just get to go back and explore what you missed with a few new cosmetic items. Oh and there is the mysterious lack of Australian accents. Still it's one of the best single player games I've ever played. I really hope there are as many of these games planned as there are Mad Max movies.  In short if you like cars and fighting and games where the fun part of the game is from beginning to end, you're gonna like this game.   Overall is it worth full price? I'd say yes. Is it addictingly fun? Yes Will it make you drive more like a psycho? Possibly Is it a gateway drug into modding your own car? Oh yes",

It involves a lot of driving around in the barren wastelands, and finding camps to take down, scarecrows to destroy and many more things. The games main character is Max. Max is a man who lost it all. After your car is destroyed, and you have nothing, you meet Chumbucket. A lunatic liing in the wasteland, worshipping a divine spirit called the 'Angel Combustion'. Together with him you upgrade your Magnum Opus (A car) and your final goal is reaching the Planes Of Silence.  Pros and Cons  Pros: +Great driving mechanics +Good combat +Storyline is good as well +Super good optimized (i could play it at 30 fps with my geforce 840 m) +The capture mode  Cons: -Game can get a bit repetitive after you completed the story and side missions -Chumbucket talking to you with the same lines over and over  My rating of this game: I enjoyed playing this game so much. As you can see i also spent a considerate amount of time with it, before writing this review. I was really surprised that i was actually able to run it. As i said, the game can get a bit repetitive, after the story, as you can only drive around and clearing threat in the different areas. I really enjoyed the story, as i think it was thrilling to watch Max become less the mad man he was. There is also an issue i have with this game. You never really feel that you'll run out of water. You never feel that you'll run out of gas. It doesn't really make you feel like you're in a dire situation. After a few hours of playing this game, i could just teleport to a stronghold, and get water. I really enjoyed this game, and i really recommend it. Finally Warner Bros. didn't come out with a game only half finished. Nice job!  If i had to rate it would be a 9/10!",

The first few hours, as I had feared failed to impress and I found the whole experience a little dull and underwhelming. However, I persevered and something pulled me back in for another try.   It's frustrating in the first few hours, and you will die a lot. You'll be punched to death/fall off a ledge/get ran over repeatedly while your car is slowly repaired.   Yet if you give it a chance - and the mood takes you, and you can get into Mad Max it really is a fantastic, criminally overlooked game, which looks gorgeous, is fantastically optimized and addictive as anything you have played.   In a nutshell, the game is split into regions (all completely open after an early mission, with no load screens or barriers inbetween, at least not that I came across) and you need to perform tasks such as destroying an enemy camp, in order to reduce the threat level, which in turn unlocks upgrades for Max and your car the Magnum Opus. If you've played Far Cry/Assassins Creed/Shadow of Mordor you know how this type of game mechanic works.   There is something strangely satisfying and addictive about leveling up in this game. It has a certain old school flair, whereby nothing ever feels impossible, even if you fail at the first few attempts. To me, that was always the mark of a great, well balanced game - you always have a shot of accomplishing your goal the first time around, and it never takes more than two or three attempts should you fail - including the racing challenges which are optional, thankfully.   It captures the spirit of the films nicely in terms of the character names and bizarre, twisted traits found in the bosses and main personalities found throughout the game. Mostly inspired by Fury Road, much of the game will seem familiar if you have watched the movie, and there are plenty of nods to the original trilogy as well.   The voice acting is good, the landscapes are bleak and beautiful, and the Magnum Opus feels suitably powerful. There are character bios (all of which are in keeping with the tone of the films) and a wealth of information and tidbits about the world available from the menu screen.   Mad Max is a rarity for an open world game - given it's enormity, it almost has a linear feel to it, and you have very limited options as to how you can approach the game - once you've done it, it's unlikely you would ever consider a replay, but in the near fourty hours I have played I have enjoyed it tremendously, and often found that sitting down for twenty minutes to destroy some oil pumps or tackle a convoy turned into an obsessive three hour stint, being unable to tear myself away chasing that next upgrade or hood ornament.   Overall Mad Max is an excellent game I find it difficult to fault, other than in terms of replay value.   Oh, and one thing - there is a glitch with one camp - you'll know it when you get there - whereby waves of enemies keep on coming at you, and the doors don't open, and you'll Google Youtube videos of the wall trick to complete it. Take note - remove all accessories from the Magnum Opus, blast up there, and DON'T AIM - JUST AUTO FIRE! Camp complete.  Sole glitch in an otherwise awesome game. 8.5/10",

If you're looking for a game that's close to the newest movie, this isn't it. All it's got Max and Gas Town with some nods to the movies that you'll understand but not see. What you'll find in this game is a bunch of awesome car combat, along with some hand to hand combat. If you're a completionist this game will be great for you. I find the 100%ing extremely fun and it's not extremely terrible like a lot of games are. If you have the money, the $60 price tag isn't an issue, but if cash is tight and you don't want to pay full price, the game goes on sale on Steam at $20 pretty frequently, and lower on some other sites.  I don't write many game reviews but I loved this game so much. I highly recommend you try it.",

Or, in case of Mad Max, you don´t run around, you drive. And that is the second very cool part about the game as you can modify your car as you see fit. The whole design follows the Mad Max Fury Road movie design with awesome desert landscapes and some really cool interior ideas. You can upgrade the car, Max himself (gear and abilities) and the holdouts you unlock on your way.   Like Shadows of Modor you have to be careful and pick your fights carefully until your car, your character etc. have reached a certain level but once you reached that the game becomes really fun as you can rampage away as you please.   Again like Shadows of Modor the story line is a bit meager but as both games are more about running/driving around and slicing up/kicking ♥♥♥ that was to be expected.   I give this game a 7/10. It´s really fun but the story is (as I said) a bit meager and the game forces you to jump through a couple of hoops I consider unnecessary. I particularly hate it when forced into story time missions without proper controls where you have to grind and grind and have to be lucky to get passed just because some overpaid developer didn´t have any fresh ideas.",

            "review_text": "If you're like me; and enjoy the Mad Max movie franchise this game is for you. Is it a great game? No its not... But as a fan of this universe I found myself smiling and really having fun being in this world. The tone of this game is very much like the tone of the movies. Morbid, lacking color and crazy.     Gameplay 7/10:  Take every RPG game made in the last 10 years and throw its elements into a Mad Max world. Seriously.... why does every game need to fill the void with collecting things, breaking things, tearing down things, climbing things. Isn't there some other game mechanic that devlopers can come up with? Throw in a mix of exciting and fun car combat and a copy/paste clone of the batman fighting mechanics and you have a really medicore mix of smiles and yawns. For the most part when I was outside of my car I hated the game. When I was inside it was a blast. Much like the movies you could say. Leveling system a very simple one. Do things get tokens which you can then use with the weirdo/philosopher guy to uprade yourself. The worst part of the game actually comes inside of the car though. Through a game mode called 'Death Run' which is a race. With exploding barrels and bombs and snipers taking out your tires. It's a dumb mode, that lets you litterly blow up the other races at the start line as soon as the race starts. The barrels often knock your car out of control and make you lose the race.     Visuals 9/10: From the lighting to the dust storms, this game is beautiful. This is the shining example of building a world that looks and feels like its movie counterpart. The fire and smoke shoots out like a scene from Fury Road. With that amazing dark red and black mixed with a hint of orange. Fire flys from your car and drops on the ground still burning fuel from your muffler and adds a deep effect to the games realism. Sparks fly, explosions everywhere. If Michael Bay made a video game, this would be it. The dust storms rolling in on the horizon make your jaw drop. Like that scene from Fury Road. Looks like a painting coming to life. Negitive points only because of the poor use of Depth of Field sometimes make things grainy and out of focus.     Story 8/10: Short, to the point. First plot point is just to build a sick car. Max is Mad about building a beast of a car. He has his trust companion Gollum on his side. I mean Chumbucket. A hunchback, radiation poisoned mad man that prays to the combustion god. He is all about taking care and building the car, which he calls the Magnum Opus. Then after doing some car things and chours for people in order to get some car things, you get to experience the 1979 Mad Max movie plot all over again. Which I guess is fine.     Sound 9/10: Everything but the soundtrack is brilliant. Gun Shots, explosions, engines screaming. Soundtrack is dull and sometimes there is silence. I actually turned on the Fury Road soundtrack in the background and it made the game feel 100% more awesome. I suggest doing the same. The Fury Road soundtrack while in a car chase or beating people up will give you chills and make you feel like a badass.     PC Port 9/10: Some problems with depth of field and other consoley thigns hold it back a little. The devs still did a good job of making it run at 60+ fps and have made some great strides in optimising the game.     Value 10/10: If you're a OCD collector like myself you will find this game will offer you 50+ hours of gameplay and even more if you are into really 100% things. If you are into just doing the main storyline then take a 5 off of the score. Because its short that way.     TL:DR: A great Mad Max story redone with stunning visuals and very fun car combat gameplay. Falls short on gameplay outside of cars and has a bunch of tedious collections and loot scavaging. Story is what you would expect from a Mad Max title. Tons of hours of play time if you are OCD and like to 100% things, if not you should get 15-20 hours or so.    Total Score: 7.5 out of 10. Higher if you a Mad Max fan.      ",

A tip to get many scrap is to disregard the safety warnings :) of the storm warning due to loot crates spawning in storms.   Loot crates can be harpooned and a total of 3 spawn per small region, each crate contains 3 pieces of scrap containing a constant 100 scrap per piece, for a total of 3x3 = 900 scrap per little region, for those who are grinding to upgrade their V8 engines    ",

The fighting was not boring as the different types of enemies kept the battles fresh.

My review won't be reflecting graphics quality as i've had issues running a lot of my games since a current update to my OS i'll be working with. But the gameplay itself was rather solid.  pros: -extremely sizable open world -single player (a nice almost relaxing change if you're burnt out from online games and need a break) -you get to see and use your progress through the game. Something felt rather satisfying seeing more people join the strongholds as it grew (as did my scrap wallet) -explosions, lots  mehs: -from my gameplay quality i'm unsure of how well optimized the game has been, in my lower framerate range i noticed it varying a lot -for all of you batman arkham series fans, the battle mechanics are near identical with less controls to worry about -enemy AI seem always vigilant, making my total count of sneak kills about 3 by this review. -unless I'm missing something, (and granted i should have gone and checked before writing this review, will check and edit this part once I do) the possibility for griffa tokens seems to be incredibly unbalanced to the max total you can use on him to max your stats. This could be so that players can play to their style and still hopefully rack up enough to max their stats but with going around and simply doing story missions and most of the death races You'd more than likely have more than enough without doing intel quests/whatever else with all the killing you'll be doing just to get to the next story mission  cons: -Even after patch 3 i've noticed numerous audio bugs, which for me was a dissappointment after the rather high-quality audio from the arkham series. -mouth movement in cutscenes often didn't match up with the audio (could probably be added to the previous con) -scrap locations.... if you are one to 100% a game, then have at it, but I believe the creators set these up to gain avg. gameplay hours from their players. You'd gain as much scrap taking out 3 cars as you would in some of the scavanging locations. The only vital scrap locations are maybe the pallets and the stronghold items which i found ammo (storyline) and cleanup crew to be some of the most useful ingame, the scrap crew is nice for being away but i've seen little advancement with it vs. the regular stronghold profit.  and the big one, the story. I won't go into detail as to not spoil anything for newcomers. The most irksome thing to me in the story is the bonding of the characters. To me it seems like they wanted max to continuously push away those around him yet his actions and talks with griffa constantly betray this main plot idea. Maybe more that Max just isn't being honest with himself. Later in-game bonds begin to form with what I assume the creators wanted to be major characters instead of minor characters but their role by this point was undeveloped and felt half-baked. Max is meant to continue on alone, he is the modern lone ranger, I get that. However, I feel like a lot of the game's story could've gone more fluidly. A game with straight-forward linearity can be nice, but being able to make some slightly pertinant decisions to characters or situations in the game, allow the player to feel attached to part of the game, making the sensation deeper and gaining a better experience from the player. Mad max was more a 'I'm gonna tell you to go here, go here, kill, blow stuff up, and in return you get chunks of metal to slap on your car like you can make a fully functional engine out of the 300 superchargers and 200 radiators you've scavanged across the great white.'  All negative points aside, in the end I actually very much enjoyed it, and plan on continuing to play and clear out the rest of the camps and such. It may not be suitable for everyone and I'd suggest watching a playthrough or something of it if you are unsure, don't waste your money if you dont know if you'll like it. But I certainly enjoyed it, and I would still reccomend this game. Some of the hiccups can be fixed, and I hope they offer some sort of story DLC to the game as I think it could use a little more support to the backbone of the game.",

Lots of driving.  Usually, I would go into the story here, but I won't spoil it. The beginning is great so... The basics are that you need to create a new car, The Magnum Opus. As you progress you get to customize your car a ton, so you can have a car that's slow, but almost impossible to destroy, or you can have a car that is fast, but weak etc.....  Ground combat is brutal, It's like Shadow of Mordor but without the swords. You really don't use guns, aside from a shotgun which you don't have mutch ammo for. You can upgrade Max to have better versions of Brass knuckles etc... you can pick up spears, machetes, baseball bats and other stuff from enemies, which you can use only for a short period of time as they break pretty easily, plus you can't get into your Magnum Opus with it as Max immediately drops it.

I believe the strong point in the game that it might provide fun for those who are hasty and for those who like making every small detail on an open world or a mix of those (such as myself).  Having means to make your Magnus Opus a car of legend, you soon start looking for means to have the parts and the scraps to build them. Besides, you also have Fortresses where you can replenish your resources (if you build them), and make fast travels, and run for your death trying to get new vehicles.  I admit that near the ending I started getting bored with the worldly missions and got rushed up to the last missions at Gas Town, so the game ended rather suddendly (although it'll continue from there, if you want).  Car battles can be rather nice and/or extremely annoying, depending on what you have to do. Sometimes some stupid small rock you make your world an inferno. Alas, that's what it takes when driving at high speed trying to explode other cars which are trying to do the same to you.  Man-to-man battles get fairly easy in no time. You must mainly be wary of counter-attacking at the exact moment, even when you a surrounded by a dozen foes of different attack styles, it's not hard finishing them up without being hit once. Also, learning battle skills make these battles even easier and faster to finish up.  I also think that you must visit Griffa more often to learn what he has to say to Max. I used to visit him after collecting around 15 or so Griffa Tokens, so I visited him not that often and got Maxed out in all my abilities too soon, then I guess something was left 'unsaid'.   Graphically, it is a pleasing game that I need not to play in low stats. The voice casting was also nice.  Something that got a bit boring was sniffing out land mines with the dog and cleaning the maps whole, sometimes going to very far fetched places to get only a handful of scraps in which you could also get by exploding a single car in your way down there. I believe some places could be a bit more rewarding.  Story-wise the game is not groundbreaking. It does show some situations in which you ponder about how it would be if it was real, specially considering natural resources, food and the likes. Still, it has room to show a branch of expansion towards Bullet Farm, which is again only mentioned here, just like it was in the movie, so I think there's a probability to have an Expasion entitled Bullet Farm. As long as they don't simply only add a new region without any tweaks in gameplay to make the game less repetitive and more engaging and insteresting.  All in all I would give a 8.5 even a 9-10 for this game. It was fun.",

            "review_text": "So, now that I finished the game 100%, I can properly and thoroughly review it.  It should be noted that the game has a somewhat faint connection to the movie, and it's probably a good thing - game devs had a greater freedom in terms of things they could make.  Before you read the review, you should understand that this is a sandbox game with all the cliches and quirks sandbox games have: lots of collectibles, vast map, going from A to B, killing X enemies. I do not mind such gameplay, if the game provides something in return for my struggles, and Mad Max delivers.   What I loved about the game:     Graphics are absolutely gorgeous - I had no idea the desert could be so beatiful. Cars and people are made in great detail, and special effects are top-notch. True eye-candy.     Storyline and atmosphere - the game is true to older, darker, grittier vision of Mad Max - the character has no remorse, he is a broken shell of a man, willing to sacrifice anything to complete his goals.     Car gameplay - driving your Magnum Opus is always pleasant experience - it really responds to your modifications and changes, gently pushing you to find new pieces to improve it. The game also provides quite a vast customization pool for the car, allowing you to choose various tactics to deal with numerous enemies on roads.    As you can see by the amount of hours I spent in the game, I found a lot of elements of the game appealing, but these come to mind as gems. However, there were some little problems that reduce my final grade a little bit.     Hand-to-hand combat is lacking depth. It has a well-known batman mechanic of one-button hit and one-button parry, and you can take melee weapons, and use shivs and shotguns, but the upgrades do not add any real definition or depth to the fighting. At first 8-10 hours it is not visible, because you do not really fight that often, and Max has a lot of moves to compensate for lack of depth.    At first, it appears that there are many types of enemies, since there are 3 factions: Roadkill, Scrotus and Buzzards, but they are essentially recolours of existing models, and there are only 4-6 distinct fighting mechanics along the enemies.    Bomb defusal optional objectives and the Dog. The Dog plays semi-important part of the story in the beginning, but then gets unceremoniously put away until you explicitly need it. I know this is not Fallout, and Max does not care much about Dog, but it is not mentioned at all later on.    You can see that most of my complaints have the same basis - lack of content. The game could be much better if the devs tried to introduce a little bit more diversity to the enemies, Max's moves, and Wasteland missions. However, you will only start noticing the abovementioned problems after 8-10 hours in the game, which means that you pretty much already get a good value from it.   Final grade: 8/10.  If you are a fan of Mad Max - play it. If you are a fan of sandbox games - play it. If you like dark, gritty, post-apocalyptic settings - play it. It is all-around good game, and you probably won't regret getting it.",

Pros: Lots of things to do Punch on scenes and fighting tactics personalaties of characters open world feel weapons and enhancements looks amazing Cons: None really only that there is no MP or Coop (Coop would be wonderfull to have factions etc) The car revs wild everytime you get into it, considering Fuel is a valuable resource that does not make sence. not mention it is anoying after a while. Must have game in your collection.. And if they would allow modding tools so people can make there own coop mp that would be a bonus..",

Yea, I  SORTA  heard about this game afterward. Not much though.  But no, I never paid attention to it, just like everybody else I know, including you probably.    Here are a few short statements that describe this game for those of you who are short on time or looking for a short read( TL;DR for those who really want an even shorter read at the bottom ):     Those screen shots? Long as your not on a potato hooked up to a monitor with an old VGA cable, those screenshots are pretty accurate to what you'll find in-game. Not totally, but closer than most games will advertise.    Didn't play much Batman, but the game feels alot like it. (I play on a X360 controller)    Those Buzzards dont look like birds at all....    Very well optimized.    That open-world tag up in the corner is right. It actually is an openworld game. Go left. Go right. Go up and down if you like. There are only a few set paths for certain quests in the game.     Leather out of fashion? Wrong. Leather is always in fashion. Even if your your girlfriend doesnt think so. But lets face it. You dont have one if you wear that. And you dont need one either.     Is she still nagging you about that leather? Pray to the Angel Combustion and silence that blasphomous demon with a shiv to the back of the skull. Or with a shotgun made out of scrapmetal. Or, if you dont want your nice leather to get blood on it, use a sniper rifle for less personal silencing.     Hahahahahahaha, he said Scrotus.... That sounds like a dirty word....    Dang, who knew that a giant pit filled with almost nothing but sand and dirt could be made to look so beautiful.    Your not supposed to shoot the War-Crier, its a rule you know. I was just telling you in case you didnt know.      TL;DR: Great game. Buy it. Get meds for your ADHD.  ",

As someone with no experience of the films I saw a movie tie-in game with mostly positive reviews and thought 'oh, that's quite rare'.  This game isn't just a good movie tie-in, it's a solid game. And to be honest, it's far better than it has any right to be.  Combat is simple, yet nuanced. The landscapes shockingly varied. Upgrades not entirely linear, with some room for play.  Kudos to the devs, the only real gripe I have is that the personal and main plots don't progress in sync with each other, which meant I had a slightly weird tone to the ending. Given how poor games writing is in general, I can forgive that.",

It uses a model similar to Batman Arkham City and if you play this title you will know what I mean. I want to get into it's finer points, but first I'd like to point out that Mad Max does better at capturing the Post Apocalyptic theme than does Fallout 3 &amp; 4.  - Open World.  Similar to Arkham City in that you have free open world, but it's bigger and you have a vehicle to rampage through it in. The Open world feel is perfect. Some games try to do this but can't get it right. There are some amazingly creative contructed spots to explore. The desolation fits and makes you feel a sense of   -Customization. The vehicle customization is unhinged and is one of the most fun aspects. To some it might be strange to center the main plot around building the perfect car, but I swear if any developer could have done it right it was these guys. If customizing your car isn't enough then customize Max Rockantowsky. Still not enough there are a bunch of different bases that have some needed customizations or upgrades too.  -Sound or music. I work in film and I know how important this is to making a good movie. I didn't realize how well it enhanced my experience in this game as well. Whoever did sound really did nicely even down to whatever value they set for hearing a person talk from at a distance to the roar of the car engines to explosions to hearing the voices in open areas to caves. I can tell a lot of work went into this and it deserves honorable mention.  -Characters and Voice acting. The sound crew really did well at capturing these fine actors voices. I believe it is some of the finer acting I've seen in gaming and I can be very critical as an actor myself. Character wise, oh my gosh, Chum is the best NPC I have ever seen done in a video game. The character Chum who is your mechanic is fanatastic! He is creepy, his comic relief isn't forced, and if you play this you wil see he is the most useful. When I first started playing I didn't trust him. Once he started proving himself I wastalking to my computer screen telling him to shut up. By the time we were smoking the best V6 engines I loved him, he was my pal and made me feel an array of opinions about him which I believe is the halmark of a truly well done character. Seriously, great job Warner Brothers and great job to Jason Spisak in this role.  All in all, I don't really need to go into the finer points just look at the screen shots. Look, if you have the system to run this game then you should really just reward yourself and let this game rock your world. Honestly, I'm worried that Mad Max (2015) may have ruined Fallout 4 for me; in a good way.",

What I liked most about this game though was the way the fighting felt. you could almost feel all those heavy wrenches and stuff in your gloves as you cave in faces and rib cages. It works kinda the same as the arkham series batman beatdown style, but max cant backflip 20 feet to hit someone on the other side of the field, so he just does more hitting instead. The melee was repetitous in a way i never minded, and you could always spice it up by shanking someone or letting off a shotgun shell... maybe at a gas can. Max is a completley unstoppable beast and you can almost taste the rage. Mmmm... bitter. Ever been so mad you picked a guy up and threw him down on his head? Ok just you and max then.   buy it, help people collect garbage for their garbage towns. take things that arent yours just because you need them. let every one you know learn just how much they dont matter at all.

Although the story line is a little lack luster (so far - haven't even completed it yet) the enviroment that you'r exposed to is harsh and unforgiving.   The game looks pretty great with nothing but wasteland as far as the eye can see and the vehicles and characters all have a decent level of detail. The map covers a fairly large area and hosts many strongholds, little secrets and remnants of the world before the fall of humanity. Some of the characters have interesting stories and offer a bit more depth to the game.  The ability unlock numerous componets for vehicles and perks for Max keeps me always looking for the next upgrade so there no massive lulls in the gameplay.   The only aspect to the game that I actually have a negative viewpoint on is clearing minefeilds - it can't be done on-the-fly and is time consuming let alone the fact that there is no skill required in it at all so its not challenging in any form either. It just slows the game down in my opinion.  Aside from that, for what little it costs, it's a pretty decent game with very few minor flaws. Highly recommend it!",

Not really game breaking bugs, but pretty annoyingly obvious ones that should have been patched.  - Controls are very sluggish, moreso when running around then when driving though. It plays (and may very well been based on the same engine) as the old KOTOR games. Not that hard to ajust to, but pretty bad in 2016.  - Can get very repetitive.   - Upgrades can be totally meaningless. And weirdly staggered out of order.  - Dialog can be really really out there, and seem to have no meaning what-so-ever.  - Chum is obsessed with ripping off tires with the harpoon, often to your detriment.

            "review_text": "The User Reviews are correct - Mad Max is an over-looked gem of a game.   At first glance you'd think you were playing another canned, boring formula game such as 'Rage' employed. But Mad Max is much, much more fun and interesting, well-polished and balanced.  The inspiration to keep playing comes from the need to upgrade your car and fighting abilties by collecting scrap, parts, and completing open-world objectives, such as clearing 'camps.' Camps are fun, because there is some real variety to their types and layouts, and assortment of enemies...and the hand-to-hand combat is fun, well-done, and shows that it's not just another FPS action game.  And that's the key - you battle enemies and overcome obstacles in the game, in a variety of ways...your car, its harpoon, sniper and shotgun options (with very limited ammo so you use them spaingly, as they're tied to set hot-keys), or you can toss a lighted gas can, or use a melee weapon if there's one lying around (temporarily).  You essentially take-over various areas of the map, leading up to the final confrontation with Gas Town, which is the key to survival, dominance, and easy-living in the desert. But it will also take a buffed-out car and abilities to do it.  The driving is fun and well-done, although the camera can be a tad wonky when fighting or driving, it's tolerable and otherwise similar to any other modern game in that regard. Your main car (Magnus Opus) is heavy and loud, and comes from 3-4 different models of your choice (they are not drastically different).  Finally, the voice-acting is fantastic! What a surprise to experience Ace voice actors and characters in a game, makes such a big difference to the game's charm and sense of immersion. Chum, your mechanic assistant, is a classic video game character who is constantly jabbering warning you of on-coming enemies in the distance. He's a great, whacky character, and have nothing but praise for his voice actor, seriously one of the best voice-over jobs and writing I've ever experienced in a game.  The environments are detailed and immersive (for a desert), the storms are crazy cool, and the sunsets are great to drive around in. Roads are faster than the shiftier, deeper sand off the road, cars spin accurately in the dirt.  Got this for $10 on sale, and maybe that makes me a bit biased, but the game deserves more praise from the gaming media than it has received.    ",

The melee combat is not just a bleak copy of the Arkham games, but improves upon them in some ways. The car combat is not the gimmick that some people make it out to be, but is grounded in non-trivial gameplay systems that feel satisfying to use.  However, the one issue with the game that I couldn't get over was the awful pacing for someone doing a completionist playthrough. If you clean up all the outposts, missions and pickups in the first area, you have seen a lot of what the game has to offer. There is no clear motivation to go and do the other areas, and if you attempt them you get mostly negative reinforcement when you realize that the new outposts and missions are extremely similar to those you have already done.  It is possible that the pacing works better if you skim on the surface of the additional content and focus on the main quest, but I didn't play the game like that. I would have preferred a shorter game that offers a reasonable amount of additional content that is meaningful, avoids repetition and builds towards something.

            "review_text": "Wow. This game took me by surprise. First off when I started out in the game, I thought 'These graphics look ridiculously good'. Then I wondered around on foot and completed the first set of missions until I was able to drive the car. And that's when I drove around and thought 'This world is huge!'. But that was before I checked the map for the first time and realized that the part that I thought was huge was only one twentieth of the entire map. Whoa. I didn't like the combat at first but as I began upgrading max, I began to like the combat way better, because of all the moves you can have max learn. I also love how much the game plays like the movies. It really feels like an entirely new mad max sequel. Really really good game that I would totally recommend purchasing if you love games like Batman Arkham or Tomb Raider. The only thing that I found a problem was the controls feel a little bit clunky to me but then again that might just be me idk. I found the story very deep and actually pretty emotional. It really proves to the audience how Max is so detached from the world; he loses everything. The death races are a bit annoying to do with a keyboard but they are all pretty much optional. There is TONS of extras in this game to give any hand to hand combat-lover, gear head, lore fanatics or completionist a lot of replay value. If I were to add one thing to the game it would probably be a new game plus option, that way, my scrap, upgrades, and progress through the map/outposts would carry over too each new game. I would love a feature like this because after you complete the main story/side quests, the extra stuff to collect in the game may get a little repetitive/grindy for some people, but I was able to look past this due to the diverse vehicle/hand to hand combat. Overall, 9/10 game. Definitely an experience to remember and one of the few recent games I've played with a story that really stuck with me.",

It really only seems to exist as an excuse to move you from zone to zone. Several missions, including one that forces you to do every activity in a zone, serve only to impede your ability to aquire upgrades. Too many missions or activities require you to slow your momentum or return to an early zone and thereby suffer outright boredom if you want to complete this game.  -Late game car combat difficulty: I like the vehicle handling. It reminds me of the Mad Max muscle cars and the indie movie Bellflower (inspired somewhat by Mad Max). What I don't like is the way that car armor is used late game to remove the most enjoyable part of the car combat (the grapple gun) and the way the AI can outperform you or get random speedboosts in cars without nitro. It's something that can be learned to deal with, but it's just not fun.  -Dejay vu: The huge game world is split up into zones that feature the same tasks in every zone. The developers did a great job adding random touches of personality here and there. However, it's far too easy to experience moments of 'didn't I just do this?'  +Optimized like ♥♥♥♥ yeah: Even on my old GTX 750 this game runs surprisingly well. There are occasional stutters at Low with resolution 1920x1080 but that's about it.  +Mad Max inspired all the way: Mad Max as a character isn't very interesting. However, this game is arguably more about exploring his world then exploring him, and from that perspective the game does really well. The cars, the combat, the guns, even the stupid hot-air balloons feel like they belong (the hot-air balloons are stretching it a bit, though).  +Open desert world: I am a huge fan of post-apocalypse wastelands, and the open world for this game is on par with Fallout and STALKER. Actually, between Fallout 3 and Mad Max, I'd say Mad Max wins both in terms of world building and personality. My hours were spent driving everywhere and trying to see everything, because there is always something new when you least expect it.",

Running an Nvidia 970 with every setting cranked up to its highest possible value (beyond the presets), I get a solid 60-80 FPS at 1080p. The only time I've noticed the framerate drop is, oddly, around numerous latern/candles (not sure exactly how to describe them), which only bottomed out at 48fps. The issue seems to be limited to these particular objects and no other sources of fire (like burning cars) or other graphically demanding things (like giant sand storms) seems to bring it down at all.  The game, like many these days, seems to handle controllers relatively well. I plugged in my 360 controller while the game was still running and automatically detected it and instantly switched the buttons displayed on the interface upon using it, and switched it back upon using mouse/keyboard (you can swap between the two, no problem). My only complaint here, which, I know is nitpicking, but the game doesn't seem to be able to handle simultanious controller and mouse/keyboard input well. As absurd as I'm sure it may seem to some, I like to be able to use my controller to drive with one hand and my mouse to aim with the other, and while I'm using the mouse the controller input goes undetected, so I'm not able to drive and shoot as well as I'd like. The slow-mo and aim-assist makes aiming fairly easy to do with the controller, so this is a pretty minor gripe.  The audio seems to be great (using the headphone configuration), but I've had a few relatively trivial issues here as well. When opening something with the crowbar (I think it's called something else in game), the sound for when something is finally opened seems to be absent. I also had an odd experience where the audio was very slightly muffled off and on for about 15 minutes. I can't say whether or not this is normal game behavior though, just the two things that stood out as seeming odd.  Overall, this definitely seems to be a great port. The few issues I've encountered are minor to the point of being something that could easily go entirely unnoticed without looking for it. While the negatives may seem highlighted over the good things here, that's mostly an artifact of any port review - if it's done perfectly there's really nothing at all to talk about, and so much of this port seems to be that.  If the game sounds interesting to you and you're a linux gamer, I'd definitely suggest picking it up.   Edit: Here's a video showing off an example of a low-fps area. The video was captured and uploaded at 60fps (so watch at either 720p60 or 1080p60 quality). The video also shows an example of one of the audio bugs (at the start of the fight). It may potentially contain spoilers.         Mad Max (linux), Low FPS area&nbsp;",

You can even strap other people's garbage onto your car, to ward off enemies, how cool is that.   You play as Max, you awake in a desert, with no clothes and no alcohol left in your canteen, you come accross a hunchback named Toto, who has a spare pare of clothes left that his father keeps sending him that... yup okay too much info. Let's skip all that, nitty gritty stuff. Well anyways Max is very mad, and he's out for blood. He found a car, well he didn't necessarily find it, it belongs to Toto. So Max was just about to steal the car when Toto decides he still is emotionally attached to the car and jumps on to the back, while Max speeds off a couple of people begin to chase after Max and Toto, Toto starts to fire this large harpoon into the tire of the enemy vehicles, and begins ripping them off, sending his enemies flying through their windshields. Max realises that Toto has some skills, and they both become great friends. Who is Toto? Exactly. . . The End.  - Is it worth full price? Well I played it and have got way over my 60 hours of fun on it, still playing it now so it's definitely earned it's value, if you can get it on sale obviously your going to any way. In my honest opinion it's a great game, loads of fun and worth it. - When your near dead the absence of water can be the difference between life or death, but without any real consequence while getting checkpoints it's really not that meaningful when you die. - The AI is very basic and over time can be very predictable, Max is just that good of a fighter. - Storywise the game does have a good story, but there have been alot of complaints that the main story isn't long enough. - The layouts of each camp can be different, the mission objectives of each camp have only minor differences that repeat with most of the other camps. - Your in a place surrounded with people that want to kill you, so don't just hang out in the middle of the road, because there will be enemies coming for you, the only safe place is camps you've either taken over or ally strongholds. - The storm events look spectacular, and help to make things interesting during a chase, and can even help assist in destroying objectives in camps if you stay near the gate way, in the safety of your car, also they come with tons of scrap if you survive it out, or you can skip the weather events by going to the base camps. These are not random, so if you can memorise where the blasts hit, you can use it to your advantage. - Difficulty it's a standard button masher, if you've ever played a button masher before you know what your getting into here for example the Batman Arkham games;  For those who are unfamiliar with button mashers, I will explain certain events that occur while battling enemies. Sometimes you'll get certain enemy notifications like charging you, the other ones a parry, car battling is pretty simple especially once you can upgrade Thunderpoon and can just blast your enemies dead. Like many other games of this genre they play quite the same even ending off with a slow motion finish, once all enemies in the immediate area (the gang currently attacking you, have been taken care of.. Some enemies require you perform a parry move first, before you can attack them, or catching them off gaurd, or using an attack shield move, before you can really begin doing any attacks to them.   Gameplay: 8/10 (Great story although short, it's easy to pick up and play, great time spender, could use more things to do in the world)  Difficulty: 5.8/10 (When compared to other open world games. Mad Max is borderline easy, but just enough difficuly where you can still die if you're not careful, it's extremely easy to learn and master, getting upgrades just makes it more easier)  Controls: 10/10 (It does what it's supposed to do very well)  Graphics: 10/10 (While comparing it to other open world games, it definitely has gorgeous graphics, they could only get better)   Music/Sound: 7/10 (Some times the sound almost kinks out completely, while driving, but when it does play correctly, it sounds nice)  -------  Possible Spoilers:   -Your car when damaged fully will engulf on fire, if you don't get out within 5 seconds, it explodes, but if you do get out, Chum just fixes it back up, (watch for repair meter to hit the arrow to be able to re-enter your vehicle, or you can also quick repair, any vehicle for those where your helper Chum isn't with you, for a price.  - Giving beggars some water, or just helping out allys grants a nice bonus to your XP/points for skills, and also grants loot locations around the world. All events are done in real time, the game doesn't stop while your giving someone water or seeking info, which can cause you to get attacked while performing certain actions, which can even cause the ones your trying to help, end up dead.  - The absence of bikes in this game, was a real downer, while playing you'll even notice they had a few tiny jokes about them, and having bikes could have really increased the dificulty.  Glitch wise:  - Invisible walls glitch: while underground (Subway train car) also while standing on certain objects, can force you into getting stuck on them.  - Missing enemies glitch: one or more of the enemies go out of the immediate area, and the game can forget about them, while you are required to kill for an objective, forcing you to run around in circles desperately trying to find them, only to realise he's no longer in the camp, requiring you to find a way to kill yourself in order for the enemy to respawn. Very frustrating.      Boss Strategy:   While standing infront of fire, aim your weapon at the boss, boss will then begin to charge toward you, dodge out of the way, the boss will usually run into fire, which leaves them open for an easy attack, repeat this tactic and you'll have that big mean bully down in no time. ;)",

            "review_text": "From start to finish, this was a really fun game. All of its various elements worked well together, and the game is as stable and bug-free as you'd hope it to be. The setting is intriguing and fun, even though it's handled as a bit of flavor rather than the focus of the game. The focus is simple: you're killing bad guys with your fists and your car. Along the way there are goals to accomplish. Most of those goals are optional, and you aren't penalized if you only focus on the main storyline while avoiding the somewhat repetative sidetracks. I loved the sidetracks, except for the races, which were just hard enough for me to only bother finishing a couple (I'd rather bash heads).   I would criticize the repetative aspect of the game, but it works to train you in getting better, and the most repetative part is also the most enjoyable: driving a nigh-indestructable scrap hot rod! Where I really wanted more from the game is in the survival aspect. There is so much water that it's hard to want for it. Fuel is simple never, ever an issue at all. Maybe since the game revolves around Gastown that makes sense, but I would have had to blow up or ignore 5 gas cans in a row to ever risk running on fumes. You do not get the sense that surviving the ravages of Nature is an issue for Max, even though it is hammered over and over that survival is an issue for everyone else. That keeps the focus more on the combat, but I would have liked to have a 'survival is hard' option.  The plot is extremely simple and offers few twists and turns, but the dialogue throughout is immersive, engaging, and bordering on exceptional. Where the story part of the game really shines is in the ending: maybe the best end for a video game I've ever experienced. Play the game and experience it for yourself; it is not an ending you can appreciate without having played through the whole thing.",

One positive/negative of the Mad Max universe is how little you know about life before and after the early days of the apocalypse. As you go around the Mad Max game theres multiple interactions and items that you pick up that tells you more of this hidden past that you wouldnt be able to find in the movies. *LITTLE BIT OF A SPOILER ALERT*    The ending for this game as actaully really ♥♥♥♥ed and sad which I find in a weird way fitting for the game.    As the game gets older I know it will go down in price (for those of you in the future) So if you have twenty bucks to spend I highly suggest buying it.

I started playing less carefully and much faster (and more in keeping with the game) after that and really focussed on the storyline because I wasnted to kill this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

While it follows the typical open world game, no two areas are exactly the same and this helps keep the missions and combat from getting too repetitive. The hours will quickly go by without you realising.  The story isn't that strong and the ending not particularly rewarding after all that work. We hear little from the main characters once their part in Max's journey is done. But this is no reason not to play this.  Most upgrades aren't very useful other than the harpoon and wrench. Collecting vehicles and Archangels serve no purpose within the game.  Of all the ways I expected to die in this post-apocalyptic world, it wasn't from dehydration trapped underneath a car service ramp (about the only bug I encountered). If you come across my decaying body in the Wastelands, there's plenty of scrap for you to claim!  Expect to spend 65+ hours if you want to complete all achievements. However, you need to continually track them as a number of challenges aren't possible to complete once the main stories have ended and you've taken down all factions.",

The boss fights are all exactly the same save for two small bosses but they fight identically. The lack of imagination for boss battles is the biggest drawback to the great effort put to fleshing out an original world.   Pros: Every base has a different layout with some very interesting visuals. The car battles can be fun but this is a very small part of the game mainly when battling convoys which there only a few. I think this was a lot of fun and a very fleshed out world that if you have the time on your hands is worth playing.

While this game has cool GRAYFIX and all that, gameplay is lacking pretty hard.  Here's the generally good stuff;  *Very nice visuals, as I mentioned. *Even though the world is mostly sand and rock, each territory has nice variety and cool locations to check out. *Melee combat has a lot of fun moves and contextual things like slamming heads into walls or pushing people over rails to their doom. *Vehicle combat is satisfying and visceral. *Story is fairly good, not much to complain about here, except the ending is a bit anticlimactic in my opinion. *Characters are interesting and memorable. *Voice acting is superb. *Low usage of invisible walls, instead uses level design and deadly storms to create boundries, that's a plus in my book.  And here's the rest;  *Poorly balanced, very easy to get very overpowered. You can reach close to Max (ohoho) level before you leave even the first territory of the game, obviously designed towards being rushed through, which is a bit sad. *Supplies are extremely abundant, fuel, water, food, ammo, whatever. Never once did I run out of anything other than water, which I promptly refilled moments later. Skill upgrades are detrimental to the game, making supplies 'even' more abundant, giving you a ton of health turning you into a tank (combine with good armor and you'll be unstoppable), making combat even easier, etc. *The only thing that ever got me killed was me being silly where I fell off cliffs or such, oops.  *Melee combat is pizz-easy(yay censorship), even if you use no combat upgrades. Melee combat also had potential to be a bit more interesting, but for no actual reason everyone fights with their fists, nobody except you has a gun (not counting snipers), and melee weapons are fairly useless and magically break after a handful of hits. You also can't store melee weapons, not even in your car. *Vehicle combat is pretty fun and provides some challenge, only real complaint here would be that you'll never ever leave the main vehicle to drive any of the other tons of vehicles available, because you can't bring cumbucket with you on anything else. *Vehicles handle poorly with keyboard controls, so get a controller if you wanna have more fun driving. Additonally, vehicle physics are a bit strange, with vehicles uprighting themselves constantly and being near impossible to flip. *Some vehicle upgrades are a bit silly, for example Armour upgrades where you stick a few guard rails on the side of your car and suddenly it weighs enough to warrant a military tank licence. You also can't even unlock and purchase the V8 stuff until there's like, 5-10% left of the game to play.  *Gameplay is very (VERY) repetative, all bosses (yes literally all) are copy-pasted with different colours and voice lines. That is a huge point deduction in my little book. *Side missions are fun for the first few times, until you realize they're all copy-pasted as well, sadly. *Sub-par freedom of movement, unbefitting a modern game with a modern engine, you can only climb specially marked areas, nothing else, not even a belly-high fence. It feels very primitive and unorganic, especially for a modern 3rd person game.  *Racing is, as you probably would guess by now, pizz-easy. You either outrace every other driver within 20 seconds or shoot out all their tires within 10 seconds ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°) I can't write much else about it since it nullifies its own existance so quickly.  *Exploring can be fun for eyecandy alone, but don't expect to be rewarded with anything substansial, only generic supplies, and Project Parts here and there, but.. Projects makes the game, once again, even easier, giving you infinite fuel, ammo, water, health refills, etc.  'But hey, it's fun to upgrade strongholds you big meanie!' So thought I, as I assumed it actually had purpose, but it turns out it has no function whatsoever. None. Unless you count looking less arze with each stage, but yeah..  *So this is supposed to be related to Fury Road right? Supposedly, but there are no real ties between the movie and the game, in either direction. Max himself also acts wildly differently between the movie and the game, it doesn't even seem like they're the same person. Compared to the movie, in the game barely anybody has guns and Max can't fight anywhere near as good in the movie as he does in the game. But now I'm stepping towards reviewing the movie instead of the game so let's drop it here shall we.   All in all, if you like Mad Max, you'll get a thrill or two out of this generally casual game, but it's certainly not worth full price, it's more along the lines of 15-20 euros.",

In fact , its the best movie-tie-in game I've ever played which you really do feel like Max on a post-apocalyptic wasteland . My opinion about this game is like a tug of war and it really does have its highs and lows .    Highs     Beautiful setting - Although it really is a wasteland , it doesn't feel that repettive . The game developers try there best to make the experience of driving around the wasteland actually more entertaining with each region have a unique character to it . Alogn with change of weather and nighttime.    Gritty Combat - Akrham-y combat mechanic without the cool gadgets and kungfu moves . When your playing Max , the only combat experience is your two fists and boy it really does feel good suckerpunch a godamn war boy in face .    World - If you like the crazyness of the franchise, then this game gives that same lust of insanity and madness that we all crave with specific tribes with there own culture and beliefs . Typical Mad Max trope to survive by scavenging scraps , food and water is also the main theme for this game.   Car mechanics and Combat - The soul of this whole franchise and this game is the car combat . Its basically Pimp-My-Ride with your sidekick Chumbucket as xzibbit . Car Combat is as entertaining as it gets especially when you high tail a convoy all by yourself , rampaging through dozens of cars jsut to get that head ornament as the cherry on top of your sweet Magnum Opus .    Story - This is probably in the middle but like any Mad MAx movie . It is kept pretty simple with a clear objective      Lows    The Grind - This is the bad apart about customizing your car , to upgrade the best parts for it you have to start doing small missions by destorying camps and clearing the region which is a chore especially if majority are almost the same . This is what BREAKS ME for this game , its tiring &amp;repetitive and I had to take a long rest from playing this game before going at it again .    THE DOG IS USELESS - At first when I saw the dog at the first part of the game you'll be like ' hell yeah , Dog partner in wasteland just like Road Warrior ' NOOOOOOPPPEEEE . The only thing that dog does in this game is to sniff out mines and there is no reward other then clearing the region out of doing this . It is menial and boring as heck .    Mini-Boss are the SAME- THroughout parts of each region theres a mini-boss camps for you to beat to get that sweet paintjob on your crib but my god is it boring . Each Mini-boss has the same moves , body and mask and it is repetitive and lazy which makes the game almost a cakewalk .     Verdict   Overall , its really not a bad game but for those who enjoy a collectathon with a same-y sandbox gameplay with added car combat and collecting while experiencing post-apocalyptic franchise then you would love this game but for me it felt like chore .",

Even enemy patrols are caring for Minefields. -Stealth: There is no stealth, the Enemies know, you are there, even if they are behind a thick wall and you have your lights off in a dark tunnel, you being in complete darkness. -Enemy awareness: The enemy knows, that you are there, don't try to hide or going around them. -Enemy cars spawning: You can keep looking around and stare on your minimap, you don't see them coming until Chum tells, what kind of enemies are appearing and then they are magical there. -Simple controls: Yep, bad point there too. Because too much is bound to ONE button. That ONE button opens doors, loot the corpses, pick up weapons, putting Finishers on enemies and to climb marked stuff. Yep, best part, the actions overlap each other. Top Dog fight, you want to finish him and...loots the corpse instead, because Reasons! -No combos: Yes, there is a lack of combos. -Scraps: EVERYTHING UNLOCKABLE is brought with Scraps. Just take Scraps to get a better Jacket! Or Scraps to get better Tires! Oh, you found the best Tires? Still spent Scraps to install it! Seriously, they tried to put Grind into this Game and that Grind is actually just a joke. -Upgrades: You must earn Tokens to upgrade Max. Sounds good, but after half the game i already have a full buffed Max, taking away the actual difficulty of the camps. -Difficulty Spikes: Yep, even fully buffed and unlocked all the Upgrades of your Car, there are missions, you hate and are FORCED to play. Best Example, the Big Chief Race, you have to change your Car to be fast and agile, and yet does the game not tell you, that you have unlimited ammo, while you try to save ammo for Gum. -Nice Start and Terrible Ending: Sounds complicated? Well, you are forced to watch a little move at the Start, that gives you the Mad Max feeling, but it is a movie, you have to wait. Then finally, after the movie, you can start playing, the tutorial, which you can't skip it as it unlocks the stuff you need to be able to do. And the end finishes off with a movie too! But that ending...terrible. -Yellow Marked stuff: Want to climb and interact with the world? Look out for yellow marked stuff, because Max refuses to touch anything else! -Unnecessary stuff: Jumping, why is jumping in the game when Max doesn't want to jump? And the forced Jimmybar, which is actually a Crowbar, just feel unnecessary and forced. What were the Devs thinking? -Sound Bugs: Yep, this exists too in the game. -Story: Won't spoil it, but to be honest, go watch the Mad Max movies, they are better. -Literal Screenshot places: Yep, there are spots, where you are thinking: Best place to make screenshot with the graphics and the special option to do so. I don't even try to find them but the game is full of them, i started to think, that the Devs wanted a Mad Max Screenshot game instead of this. -No DLC: In SoM atleast had DLCs, one in particular which gave us wonderful content to play with. But this game, no DLC, no reason to keep playing it.   I played it through, i got all the Upgrades and upgraded all the Strongholds. And this game gets mediocre after half the game, as you really have nothing to fear actually. All these good reviews must had their Honeymoon phase as this game just offers Mad Max, in a Car, in a Sandbox with Objectives. Sounds like a Mad Max Movie? Atleast the Movies are nice to watch and enjoyable.  In all honesty, i'm dissapointed. The start feels good, really. But at the half of the game, are you starting to wonder, why there are so many stones in the way, not obstacles, because obstacles would be atleast challenging. With the stones, you are just forced to stumble over them. And the end, UGH, so dissapointing, so stupid, so foreseeable and no challenge at all.",

The fighting is old news and I really disliked it even in other games so that just might be me, but it could at least have some sort of update so its not a straight copy cat. The car driving, which I imagined was the centerpiece of the game, feels sluggish and just does not feel rewarding like it ought to. It may be 'realistic' to desert driving, I have never driven on sand so I don't know. But dang at least make it fun somehow.  The story is a bore as well, Max is about as dull as the sand, and the 'crazy characters' kind of wear thin as they are all just nonsensical in the same, blaring way.  The car combat is okay, it is not great but at least the harpoon is alright and being that I have not played much I hope it gets better but I cannot get through more grinding to find out. Graphics are great, but a bunch of HD sand only keeps you in awe for about a second before you become numb to the color of beige. Also, DO NOT watch the movie if you plan to play this game as it is even a larger let down from the fantastic film. To sum up, I would rate this game akin to a puppy dying slowly.  Scratch that, I would rather play puppy dying simulator, as least that doesn't feel like a chore and would be memorable.",

            "review_text": "Super short summary: Mad max is far cry 3 on a desert with a ♥♥♥♥ing cliché storyline.  That is the main game I will use to compare mad max with because they really share a lot. But mad max also borrowed tons of gameplay mechanics from other games, in fact the game doesn’t have a single ♥♥♥♥ing unique mechanic. The devs only included tried and tested mechanics from other games like Batman (melee combat) but without batman’s intensive amount of tools/gadgets making the combat very shallow. Ubisoft’s Assassins’ creed and far cry 3’s watchtower replaced by a hot air balloon to view legends on the map. Repetitive encounters in ubisoft open world games replaced with scavenging locations where most of them you only need to get 1-4 actions/scrap to finish which are pretty meaningless since you’ll be overflowing with scrap anyways.   I don’t get why this game has such a high rating since everything was done in mediocrity and the map is only filled with repetitive tasks. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing bosses are not unique! They are all the same with very minimal changes on the terrain you are fighting with. The skill tree and upgrade tree for you and the car is very shallow, the archangels serves no purpose but to put prefabricated cars with specific parts which is most of the time weaker than your custom car (they didn’t even put a ♥♥♥♥ing bonus for using a prefabbed car). Only 3 modes in the races and they are so boring. It is such a ♥♥♥♥ing chore to finish with its hundreds of checklist to finish, I think out of the 54 hours I’ve played, the story is only 4 hours and 50 hours was spent doing all those chores to 100% the achievements and challenges. And the story line? Easily ♥♥♥♥ing forgettable, I won’t spoil but the side characters aren’t fleshed out to get the treatment that the game had given them.  Now that I have finished my rant, let’s see some of the pluses on this game. Game is well optimized, most of the time 120fps on all settings on max @ 1080p on my 980ti, but I guess it’s easy to run this game since it’s empty (desert setting remember?). Cool ♥♥♥♥ camera filters for screenshot and in-built recording (I know I said mad max didn’t have a unique gameplay mechanic, this is a feature not a mechanic). Andd uhhh, that’s it I guess?  This game could have been amazing, they could have put survival aspects where you need to eat and drink to survive making the game even longer, they could’ve added more cars and unique weaponry and ♥♥♥♥, they could’ve make each boss unique and racing duels different. But no, devs have made a very safe decision to only put simplistic designs and gameplay to it.  For this, I cannot recommend the game since this is easily forgettable. If you really want to get it, get it @ 75%, you probably can get it the next summer sale since it was already on Humble monthly for $12 ",

The story is well done but they failed in every aspect of gameplay. If you are a very big Mad Max fan and only want the game for the story and setting in the Mad Max universe you will probably get enough out of this game for the price.  The one things I really like in this game is the story and the characters, these things are wonderfully implemented, the setting is also pretty well done even though we already have so many post apocalyptic desert settings.  Everything else is either needlessly prolonged and tedious or doesn't work as it should and is tedious. Here are a few of the annoying things that get me mad: - You never feel like you have a badass car because everytime the enemy cars are finally weaker than you, you get to a new region where your car once again is weaker than even the weakest enemy. - The driving works like in any other game, it sends you flying off in random directions only because you drove over a tiny bump on the road and one doesn't need to be on full speed for that to happen, while the enemy drivers can pull off nearly impossible maneuvers. - The enemy cars will always catch up to you when they are trying to engage you, it doesn't matter how fast your car and how fast their car should be, but when your trying to get a fleeing car it's nearly impossible to only stay near it much less attack it. - In meele fighting the button presses only register half the time, so 50% of all blocks and finisher just won't register, it seems to me that somebody with no knowledge on what exactly makes that style engaging and fun tried to copy the batman game finghting style. - If you want to interact with anything you have to stand in the exact right spot and also look in the right direction or the game won't realise that you're trying to interact with it. - Everytime you want to interact with anything you have to hold the interact button instead of just pressing it, man is that tedious. - The jump they give you is the most pathetic jump I have ever seen in a video game. - Sometimes things can fall through the floor, an example: one of the hood ornaments you can get from defeating a convoy gliched trough the floor - Trying to aim with the shotgun or throwing weapons while engaging in battle is poorly implemented, because when you try to aim, the camera needs a few senconds until it's in the right place for the aiming and normally you get hit in the time it takes for that. There is a 'fast shot' where you don't need to aim, but that doesn't help you when your trying to kill the warcryer while you're getting swarmed.  And these are just a few of the things that drive me crazy. So when you can buy the game for 20-30 bucks it might be worth your money, but for a 50 buck game I can only say it's really rage inducing and disappointing.",

Well its simple 'It's boring, it feels like I'v done it before but It's was more fun back then' In Far cry the world has something to it!

All this grinding further amplifies the repetition in the game and confounds the number one issue in this game, its repetitive nature.   As for the story? Its a nothing story for the most part and, you guessed it, is quite repetitive. The entire game is basically an extended side quest, which is to say its quite repetitive.   So what would I pay for this game? I honestly, in hindsight just wouldnt have played it or bought it at all.

Either pick up the scrap 6 at time for that 1400 scrap upgrade or let your game run in the background for days. 5) No incentive to do side activities. You max out early in the game, eliminating the need to do any side activities unless you're a completionist. 6) No customization. You're Max and your Magnum Opus will be the same as everyone elses. Awesome. 7) Downgraded combat from Shadow of Mordor. I don't know about Batman, but Talion could chain together multiple takedowns to form a nonstop chain of awesomeness. Max can't do that. Max can be mid takedown and get punched in the back. Max can not chain multiple take downs in a row. Max will refuse to parry 50% of the time unless the target is right in front of him. 8)Glitches. A) Sink in sand. B) Fall through world. C) Get flung through air by dust devil. Just the ones I've personally experienced, not the ones that I've heard of or scene on YouTube.  If you were looking for something similar to Shadows of Mordor then you looked in the wrong place. They took everything but the awesome parkour, the good stealth, the better combat, and the nemesis system and made Mad Max with the disgusting leftovers. Sure the game is well optimized, but that's the best I can say about it.

Got this game for 15 bucks. Not worth my 15 bucks. The game would be 90% (probably more) busywork, if I kept playing this. Just not worth the time and money, as I don't get enjoyment out of mindless repetition. It seems 91% of all people reviewing this game do, though.",

The graphics in the game are superb and the animation quality is even better. The story gave me no motivation and didnt really make me care for the characters-even though the voice acting was very good- this was partly why i didnt finish the game.  The gameplay here is where it really falls apart though. Car combat is fun and dynamic but they dont spend enough time utilising it. It eventually gets a bit boring when you are trying to get from point a to point be and enemies contantly spawn interupting your journey forcing you to fight them. It makes the car combat feel like a chore. The ground combat though is much worse. It is the free flow combat from the Batman Arkham series but not done as well. It starts off fun but NEVER evolves and you will eventuall be spamming the same 2 buttons over and over again without having to ever change your style, beside a few times when they throw a diffrent enemy type. In the game there are only three enemy types. There is little mission variety and you will end up feeling like you have done the exact thing already. Not too mention being forced to collect scrap which often takes too long and just forces you to extend you playtime.  I really had high hopes for the game but due to a mediocre story, repitive gameplay and mission design it ends up falling flat on its face. It lays really solid groundwork for a possible sequel which could be very good, but for now rather use your 60$ to buy a game like the Witcher 3 or Metal Gear Solid V that really have amazing gameplay and story. I suggest you get this game when it costs something like 20$, because right now it really isnt worth 60$.  5/10",

I played this game for around 20h after release and took a huge break, because it simply couldn't keep me interested after that. The missions are super boring and the empty and lifeless world doesn't really help. I know it's the apocalypse, but that doesn't stop other games of the genre to make the world feel more lively. There is no interaction with the NPC's, save those few and rare moments you get a new quest. Every zone feels the same, it's filled with enemy encampments that need to be cleared and bosses that need to be killed. As I said, it gets boring really fast. I tried to like this game, and at first it was fun to play. The more I played, however, the more I realised how uninspired the game was.  And yes, i've seen the movies and loved 'em.

Here's the gameplay: -Go to an outpost. -Meet the leader. -Do something for the leader. -Find all the parts for the scrap crew (they harvest scrap while you're offline) -Take over all the camps in that part of the district. -Go to the next outpost with a leader and rinse and repeat.  The gameplay and narrative is sooo uninspired and drab. There isn't much of a story and the gameplay leaves alot to be desired. For one, the ground combat is buttom spam. The car combat has bad controls at times until you fully upgrade the Magnum Opus. Then it becomes fun. Until then, farm scrap by taking over every camp in the game.   Taking over camps is a contest in tedium. Each one is practically the same. Kill all the guys in each camp, or torch their oil well (which doesn't make sense, since you would want the oil for yourself) and then your cronies come on in and take it over, giving you scrap over time.   The controls are so floaty while you're Max. Dropping down a ladder or just falling down entirely makes you feel like you're on the Moon. They made the run button right trigger. Everything just feels awkward. You can't customize Max's look all that much. I just have several minor gripes that take away from the expeirence.  Mad Max's plot should've been this: You are trying to create your own outpost for yourself and those you trust. To do that, you have to take out all the corresponding tribes in the area. You also need parts to upgrade your outpost to withstand attacks. From time to time, you get attacked by rival factions and have to drive to your base to defend it. You can set up defenses as a mini game in case you arent there and your cronies can defend it. That would've made more sense and been alot more enjoyable then just driving from zone to zone doing the same ♥♥♥♥ as before.",

Visually it's beautiful, the cars have weight to it and while the combat is on the easy side it has its satisfying hits to it. So what's wrong with it you might ask?  The Game makes you deal with so much boring filler. 3.7 hours in I just feel like I've played this game for a hundred. Collect scrap, drive to Point A to Point B where there's nothing going on, spend 2 minutes of your time watching a hot air balloon go up in the sky. Collect more scrap, go through boring menus adding parts to an ugly car that'll never be as cool as the Interceptor. Etc.  This would be acceptable if I felt there was a percentage of the game that encouraged player creativity. From what I've seen so far there simply is not. You have to do tasks pretty much the same way each time. Sure maybe you can use your shotgun but why would you waste precious bullets when you have a harpoon with Infinite Reloads.  Games based on films should capture the feeling of the movies. Mad Max are fast and crazy movies, this game would have been far better if they reduced the tedium and just focused on blowing stuff up and kicking ♥♥♥.  Yes I did not complete the game, but I'm not a professional critic. If you're hoping for a fast paced cinematic game look elsewhere this game is slow. According to  'howlongtobeat.com'  it takes 18.5 hours to wrap the main story up. Sorry I just can't commit to that. I refuse to collect more stupid scrap.  ",

I imagine the dev conversation went something like this...  RAD = Radical Avalanche Developer SAD = Standard Avalanche Developer  RAD - Let's have him hijack vehicles to collect them, drive back to his shop to get upgrades off them and scrap for parts, and he'd have several frames to upgrade and use. Because in real life car thieves steal cars and take them to chop shops for parts and scrap.  SAD - Nah, let's bore the player by making them wander around for hours collecting paltry bits of garbage we hide everywhere which is used to to upgrade one single vehicle, there by removing the entertainment of hunting down vehicles.  RAD - Let's make them configure their car at a garage, so they have to strategically choose how to load it out, since they'll be stuck with it like that until they get back to base.  SAD - Nah, let's just let them insta-alter their vehicle on-the-fly, even in the middle of the desert while doing 80mph. People like convenience, so let's let them rip all the weight off their car instantly to make it go faster, then load it all back on to protect themselves right before they hit an enemy.  RAD - So you're gonna bore people to death by making them collect tons of garbage to upgrade the vehicle, but they can insta-swap parts while drifving... on the one extreme it's super inconvenient, and on the other it's illogically over-convenient.  SAD - Yeah, we like to throw logic out the door here.... whatever we can do to annoy players by either frustrating them with tedium or trashing all logic ... that's what we do.  RAD - Let's give Max a dog and mechanic companion, and he can have both ride with him in any vehicle he takes.  SAD - Nah, the mechanic can only ride along in the main car and repair it, so it's pointless driving any other car.  RAD - Well, let's make the dog cool by having to jump out of the car and go along with you to attack people when you're on foot.  SAD - Nah, let's just make him utterly pointless by having him only go along in one vehicle, and then only used for one very specific, boring task by driving around forever looking for mine fields then tediously clearing them out one at a time.  RAD - Let's add some stealth to the game to let Max sneak up on enemies out taking a leak and steal their cars!  SAD - Let's not. Let's have every enemy in the game instantly know where he is instead.  RAD - Let's have Max take over bases, supply lines and other things to help out friendly factions. The more area he controls, the easier time he'll have finding gas, water, etc, the more friendly patrols will roam around, etc.  SAD - Let's have him destroy everything, because that makes no sense to do so in a world that's already struggling to get by.  RAD - Let's have different enemy factions get into road battles instead of Max being the only one engaging. Those buzzards scavenge from anyone!  SAD - Let's have all enemy factions be friends with each other, and only attack Max.  RAD - Let's make road battles cool by letting Max get onto his car while someone else drives, and jump to other cars to get into fights and take them over!  SAD - Let's not.  RAD - Let's make there be lots of high-speed vehicle fights, and let Max drive in and wreck bases in his car!  SAD - Let's only have a few vehicle battles, all others are just random cars driving around that have nothing to do with anything and give paltry amounts of reward for defeating them, and make Max get out of his car for half the game to wander around getting into fist-fights and waste hours looking for hidden boxes of garbage.  RAD - If he's going to collect so much stuff, let's give him bonuses for collecting stuff.  SAD - Nah, let's just pad the game out with historical crap and cars to collect, but it's all pointless. We're just padding the game out with stuff that's easy to code.  RAD - Let's at least make it where if Max takes over a base he auto-collects all other scrap and memorabilia from that location.  SAD - What?! Wandering around collecting junk is half the fun! When he defeats a base, he can still spend hours enjoying the thrill of looking for junk that we hid in annoying locations.  RAD - Let's make one really awesome area with great scripted events and story and unique things to do! It'll be a shorter game, but it'll be a great experience.  SAD - Let's make several HUGE areas with the same repetitive tasks going on over and over that take hours upon hours to do, and once you clear an area it's just the same thing in the next area for hours on end, and clearing areas has no impact on the game whatsoever. That'll be boring and repetitive, but we can brag on the box about '100 hours of game play'  RAD - Let's give Max a sniper rifle!  SAD - ... that he can only use in his car, even though all the enemy snipers are carrying them on foot.  RAD - Let's have the mechanic auto-fuel up the car if there's a jerry can in the back.  SAD - Let's not. He'll auto-repair the car, and he'll auto-swap parts for you while driving 80mph down the road, but let's not get carried away with convenience here.  RAD - Let's have challenges that are difficult, but can be overcome if the player just grinds and upgrades a bit more.  SAD - Let's make a really hard race that downgrades your vehicle weapon regardless of how good it is, and put all kinds of twists and slopes on it that make the horrible driving mechanics really shine, and force the player to overcome that if they want to progress the story. That way 1/5th of the players rage quit the game and get a refund.  RAD - Let's have artillery at bases work for friendlies after Max takes over a base. This incentivizes him to sneak in and try to keep things intact.  SAD - Let's not, and just leave them standing there as pointless reminders that friends in bases don't do anything for Max.  RAD - Let's have a steady rate of progress that is either story-driven or xp driven, thus the player will gradually get better over time one way or the other.  SAD - Nah, let's be bipolar and make some upgrades unlock by clearing areas, and others unlock by following the story. So, players that ignore the story to clear areas are punished when story upgrades are kept locked until the last 10% of the game, and players that rush through are punished by having other critical upgrades locked away for not clearing areas. We want to make sure all players get punished for whatever play style they choose.  RAD - Let's make Max an understandable anti-hero that becomes more respectable over time.  SAD - Let's make him an unlikeable scumbag that treats people helping him like garbage and causes problems he later has to clear up because he's too weak-willed to take on his own personal issues.  RAD - Let's make the mechanic a likeable, quirky side-kick that Max slowly comes to trust and confide in over time.  SAD - Nah, let's have Max treat him like absolute garbage the whole time, even though he's the only person that sticks with him through thick and thin and has unwavering confidence in him and is trying to help him find his way.  RAD - Let's have Max auto-collect goodies from enemies when he defeats them.  SAD - That ruins the fun of trudging over to manually pick it up, though!  RAD - Let's have ti when the player hits a button, Max does the action.  SAD - Let's make the player hold down a button to do the action for no reason.  RAD - Why don't we really do something unique and awesome!?  SAD - Because, we're Avalanche. We used the same formula for Just Cause and Just Cause 2, and that was mediocre enough to make a profit. So, we're not going to change the formula.  RAD - I quit.  SAD - Good... we don't need people like you with creative, interesting ideas screwing up our mediocre games!",

There is little to no customization as they would make you think by using the word 'customization' yet they are actually 'upgrades' It would not make sense to use a 10% stat increase because it 'looks cool' opposed to a 20% stat increase.  You unlock every 'tool' in the game before the first mission even starts. Yet they advertise the 'many tools' at Mad Max's disposal. Little was stopping them from producing a great game other than not making a beta and being funded by a mega corp with deadlines and quotas. With minimal effort and funding they could correct MANY of the issues that plague this game; alas they will only focus on DLC (if we are lucky) which is not saying much at all.

I can't recommend it just *because* it's a good game, why pay 50€ for a good game when there are so many *great* games out there for less?  Here are some of my opinions about the game: * The story is kind of harsh, it was not what I expected from an seemingly common revenge plot. It fits the mad max universe well. * The upgrades are many, but customizations are very limited. Your car is everything, it's basicly maxs soul. So I found it surprising when there were so many upgrades but no customization. After all customizations are what makes your car yours. * Controlling the car was often challangeing and sometimes frustrating, the devs are not car fanatics that's for sure. You will find the controlls sloppy and a lot of wiered mechanics. For example, adding weight to the car creates a delay from stearing input and upgrading the suspension gives you more turning radius. Becuase this makes totally sense... right? * If you want all the upgrades be prepared to grind and grind and grind and grind... you get the idea.",

            "review_text": "Reviewing Mad Max is a mixed bag for me. I'm a fan of the franchise and have watched and enjoyed all four movies. I had already seen the mixed reviews ranging anywhere from 60% upto 85%, and the Very Positive rating by gamers on Steam. Had a voucher for GMG so used it and got Mad Max for a bragain, so if the game turned out to be mediocre I wasn't exactly losing much.  Truthfully, having now finished the game (with only a few locations left to loot), I did enjoy my time in Mad Max, but this comes with some cavaets. Firstly, I'll start with the pros.  Pros: Environment - The game is generally beautiful... for a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The crafting of the desolation, particularly the ocean floor is in my opinion stunning. Strangely, the working of the overly saturated pallet actually adds to the atmosphere instead of detracts and the place really feels like a world gone awry. Not much more I can say about the environment, it's just done really well. The first visit to Buzzard underground areas (i.e. the Underdome) was very nice indeed.  Driving - The driving, though extremely simplistic, is really allot of fun. The is one exception, but I'll cover that in the cons. Otherwise, whether cruising through the wasteland, or battling Road Kill, Scrotus minions or Buzzards, the handling of the vehicles just feels right. The sense of speed when hitting the higher gears is nice, espeacially after some of the later stage Magnus Opus upgrades. Using the various weapons, particularly in the wide open spaces, is simple and doesn't generally cause issues.  Fighting - I've read a few reviews where the reviewers bagged the melee combat with negative comparisons to the Batman series. I think this is a little unfair. Having played the majority of the Batman series I think Madmax's holds up pretty well on its own and feels allot more viceral than any of the Batman games. The moves are obviously less flashy (being Mad Max vs. Batman), and the game is actually less forgiving than Batman (Batman is allot more forgiving for poorly timed counters and combos), but if you pay attention to your opponents, and don't always try for the heavy hits you can chain together some very cool combat sequences... espeacially when Max's rage bar fills up and you go berzerk.  Base assaults - Probably my favourite part of the *repetitive* missions. Actually really enjoyed attacking the various bases. Prep work while driving (destroying defenses etc...), exploration and plenty of melee combat. Nearly all of the bases were hand crafted, can't really remember any carbon copies, so was interesting exploring the various bases.  Cons: Repetition - Three primary game zone hubs (3 1/2 if you include the Gas Town zone), and three sets of identical missions. The base assaults I enjoyed, but tearing down the scarecrows and sniper posts, and hunting mindfields in 3 zones was actually fairly boring. Also, the loot locations became rather boring as well. In the last zone I ended up only hunting out historic relics and base project parts. The repetition wasn't a massive detractor, but was still annoying.  Driving - Now I have this as a Pro, but there is one particular point where this is really really bad. The Big Chief race is seriously ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. What worked out in the open areas, causes nightmares in the tight confines of the Big Chief race. Partially hampered by exagerated vehicle physics which cause you to ricochet at crazy car-stopping angles off smooth walls, the real problem is the cinematic camera. If you have to target a vehicle to the side or behind, the camera stays locked on the vehicle as it's destroyed which prevents you seeing where your car is heading. Not so bad in the wide open wasteland, but in tight windy corridors it's a nightmare.  Griffa - The RPG elements are just odd, and really game breaking. I actually enjoy the conversations Max has with Griffa, but there isn't any decision to make in the point allocation. You will max everything pretty easily, so what is the point? Also, once maxed the game becomes just too easy, which is saying something when the game kinda starts out easy to begin with. The game needs hard and nightmare difficulties. Any seasoned player is going to find the game pretty casual, and if they make the mistake like I did and spend the Griffa points the game becomes Hello Kitty's Desert Fun Race.  Story/Character Development - Spoiler warning, so read with caution.   This is perhaps the worst part of the game for me. Not just have they rehashed the revenge story from the original Mad Max, they've turn Max into a completely unredeeming murderer. With how well Mel Gibson played the fracturing pysche in Thunderdome, and Tom Hardy's understated almost-mute protagonist, how could they get it so wrong in the game?   In the last three Mad Max's, Max has always shown a hint at a redeemable character. In Mad Max the game he simply a psychopath. Narcissitic, emotionless, and cruel. He is entirely at fault in the deaths of the two female characters, and in his misguided revenge spree he murders the only character that has help him. Then, just drives off. Baffling.    With that list of pros/cons, do I still think the game is worth playing? Sure, if it's cheap enough. Don't grab this at full price, it really isn't worth the price of admission. But if you get it for a bargain like I did, then it's worth a few hours, particularly for the environment, the driving and the base assaults.",

Really, there was a huge amount of work put into this game. You can see it in the way that the landscape has tell-tale icons and signifiers of an old world. You can see it in the carefully-crafted expressions and dialogue between characters (  and ol' Dinky Di  ). The gameplay concept is deceptively simple, and it all works together to draw you in.  Apart from a few annoyances, I would have given this game a 10/10. I'm a reasonable critic, and as such, I would give this game:  A solid 6. The aesthetics and the storyline carried over half the weight. Flawlessly.  As I see it, a 6 is generous, a ****ing 7 would be asking the world of me for the following reasons:  Mad Max uses the same progress-limiting tactics as the newer RPGs (see Dragon Age: Inquisition, Witcher III, etc.), where you are in an open world, but you don't have access to it until you complete enough filler quests to 'buff up' your neighborhood stronghold. While I understand that company big-hats (looking at you, Warner Bros.) want their games to have big numbers and get big ratings, this mechanic becomes anti-fun if it yields no actual  gameplay reward . In other words, this mechanic detracts from the immersion of Mad Max and prevents progression from feeling rewarding to players.  All of the big battles and the little battles are  the exact same difficulty . I don't expect the game to twiddle my   Scrotus   and give me a   Rim Jobbie  , but even the bosses and sub-bosses dealt so little damage and used such insultingly simple tactics that    the hardest part of Mad Max happened mid-way through the game, when players had to break through The Jaw  . Why even use a difficulty gauge on various locations when you can mow through the hardest areas just by performing the same block/punch/parry combo for a slightly longer amount of time? Why even bother   making a last fight with Scrotus seem like a big deal when it's so obvious that the original concept was deemed 'too hard' and dumbed down to an idiot child's level? Chumbucket even tells you how to ****ing kill him, it's insulting.    I know that I black-boxed a ton of that text, so I would like to recompose myself and reiterate: A good game  rewards  players for time and effort spent in a game. While Mad Max rewards players for time -- and it does so excellently --  the reward for effort is almost nonexistent .   To who this may concern, If I spend the twenty or so minutes that it takes to defeat a Top Dog, do me the favor of  actually making the in-game notification address him by name . Hell, go ahead and  give him a unique character model while you're at it . You already gave him a name and a background bio. If you knew this game was rated Mature from the get-go, please do not try to set the standard difficulty to toddler-level and rewarding the players accordingly.  Sincerely, Jeddest Min'Add  P.S. Please go ahead and correct the other in-game notifications containing immersion-detracting text. Your tech team and your design team worked too hard for Mad Max to be the absolute ****ing disappointment that it is.",

Not that any of the movies have had that great of a story either...  All the quests and missions are pretty much just a slightly different version of the last set you did. Visiting new areas is basically setting you up to do the same thing you did in the last section. Bosses are all the same model with the same weapon with slightly new mechanics added to each.  Now cutscenes.. All too often you will be sitting and waiting for these damned cutscenes to end. Waiting for you're water bottle to fill up, filling up your vehicle, putting in an extra gas canister into your vehicle, taking the gas canister out, etc.. It gets old quit and there is no way of skipping it. Another minor annoyance, you cannot skip the title sequence upon starting the game.  So many bugs. such as when using keyboard and mouse controls, in some dialog your mouse ceases to work. Go ahead, try and use your mouse to switch vehicles.. It does not work. You have to use a controller or keyboard to select the vehicle you would like to switch to. Another being the mouse scroll wheel fails to work that well under the part of the game that gives you detailed information on enemies, vehicles, locations, items, etc. It is very glitchy trying to scroll through the listing. Also randomly getting flung through the air for no apparent reason.. always nice. Sometimes you live sometimes you just die.  This game was definately rushed and doesnt seem like anybody play tested it using a keyboard and mouse.  The game is not even close to being worth its asking price of $60.

You conveniently meet a physically and mentally challenged wasteland autist who just happens to be a professional harpoonist and car builder/engineer/expert that will swear fealty to you for no reason at all just to sit in the back of your car while you get rammed, shot and stabbed to death and will repair the car on the go with a monkey wrench and an extinguisher when the engine goes in flames.

Once you've got all the basic car utilites leveled up enough, car combat becomes a rinse and repeat pattern of: blow their armour off and pull their tires off. Even the more leveled enemies become boring to fight once this pattern is discovered.  There are Camps, Scarecrows, Snipers, Convoys and Minefields which classify as the side missions. At first doing these things is enjoyable but once you've done them more than a few times it becomes a chore. There are variations of camps, which have a 'boss fight' at the end. I hesitate to use the words 'boss fight' because you fight the exact same character model just with different colours each time and their attack patterns are exactly the same. The combat is the same as the Batman games and Shadow of Mordor but with less variation. Once you level up your ammo belt and shotgun enough you can pretty much just shoot most enemies and not have to bother with fistfighting.  This game has a lot of stuff to do, but it's of no importance. Completing all the side missions doesn't feel fun, it just results in more stuff so you can get a slightly better this or a slightly better that.

The combat is taken directly from the Arkham serie, aka you spam click left mouse button, you rarely shoot because you don't need to. The car gameplay is boring and annoying, taken directly from watch_dogs.   Voice acting is a joke, animation are a joke.   Graphic is something we saw at least three years ago.",

            "review_text": "Mad Controls, Grind Max  There's a lot of stuff to love about this game and I'd like to do just that, but the things I don't like pretty much ruin the game for me.  Unskippable animated logos of WB Interactive &amp; Avalanche Studios. It's just a few seconds, but it still annoys me.  The controls (keyboard &amp; mouse, but I guess it's the same with a controller) are just wrong. Few examples:  * There is one general action key (E) used pretty much for everything. It picks up a weapon when you are unarmed. It drops weapon when Max is armed. This key is also used for climbing up ladders and also for various executions of stunned enemies. All too often you just accidentaly drop weapon instead of climbing up a ladder or (which is much worse) you just drop the weapon in the middle of the combat when trying to execute an enemy. This key is also used for all possible executions, where some cost you a shiv and some do not. Sometimes enemy is on the ground, making it possible to perform some kind of execution which does not cost a shiv. At the same moment when you press the E key, this enemy stands up and the execution mode is changed to 'kill with shiv' and this costs you that shiv. * Similar problem is with the F key when holding a gas canister. Normally this key lights up the canister so that it can be used to blow something up. But when you're standing behind a car, the same key is used to refuel the car from the canister. So when trying to refuel, it is not that uncommon to accidentaly light the canister on fire. * The right mouse button is used both for aiming the shotgun and for countering enemy attacks. Sometimes you can see enemy approaching you and you start to counter a little bit prematurely which ends in Max drawing the shotgun and thus being unable to counter the attack and dropping any melee weapon he was holding. * The game hints when you can counter an attack or perform an execution. The problem is that apparently all these actions have some max range (you can't execute an enemy at the other side of the room) and the game does not take that into account when hinting a possible action. So all too often you press E for 'melee weapon execution' just to drop the weapon because Max is not in range. The same is with countering enemy attacks which started out of range, which result again in drawing the shotgun and dropping any equiped melee weapon. * Problem with hints is that if in combat you have two stunned enemies and one on the ground, you have on screen three hints which all say that by pressing E, you will do this action. At these moments I'm really confused as to what action exactly will pressing the E perform. Most often in these situations I'm happy with just dispatching any of the hinted enemies, but end up just dropping equiped weapon instead. * The controls sometimes feel bit unresponsive and there is no reaction from the game when I'm trying to perform an execution or block enemy attack.  Advanced car components have various requirements, where some of them are tied to grinding. I'm completely fine with the approach where to get the best engine, you have to completely clear some part of map of enemies and then get the engine as a bonus reward (just an example, not actually in game). There are similar requirements for some of the components. The problem is that some of these are not optional and you need these grind-earned components for some of the main story missions. I have my moments where I like just to roam the map and destroy enemy buildings / capture bases and there are other times where I'd like to advance the story. I don't like being forced to 'destroy N enemy structures' to lower threat, earn another component and thus be able to advance the story.  You can raid various small settlements for scrap (used as a currency for upgrades), but it's not really worth it. Raiding any settlement takes at least few minutes (defeat enemies, explore the settlement and find all the scrap lying around) and you get few tens units of scrap. Low tier components cost 100-200 scrap, mid tier around 900 and the best even more. So it's not really worth it to try to get the scrap for upgrades by raiding these settlements. You get much more scrap by capturing enemy bases. These are then occupied by allies who give you some scrap on regular basis. So the best way is to actually capture few bases and then let the game running in AFK mode, to get the scrap needed for upgrades.  At times the game fails to explain some (possibly important) concepts:  * In strongholds, you can build stockpile by giving up large amounts of scrap. The game says that building the stockpile helps the stronghold grow. OK, but it is never mentioned what are the benefits of stronghold growth (other than more people showing up in the stronghold when visiting it). * You can break enemy limbs by performing a 'perfect parry'. Unfortunately it is not mentioned what that is. Judging from the Arkham series experience I guess it would be hitting the 'block' button at the exact moment when enemy blow lands, but so far it just feels pretty random.  In combat you can break enemy limbs and bury knives deep into their eyes. The problem is that the enemy is then completely happy to punch you with the broken hand or attack you again with no regard to the knife in the eye (which also magically disappears).  Upgrading stronholds is bit unnecessarily time consuming. To build an upgrade you first need to find it's components scattered in the wastes and I'm completely fine with that. But to actually build that upgrade, you then have to go to the stronghold and find the empty spot where this upgrade is supposed to be built and then build it there. It would be much better just to arrive to the stronghold and build it without having to go anywhere else, or have it auto-build just by visiting the strongold.  Apart from the very poor controls (car control seems OK) and story-required grinding, the game itself is not that bad. For me it's not worth the full price and I regret buying it now. For lower price or with at least the controls fixed I could recommend it.",

I should say I plan on playing all the way until I beat Mad Max but I don't think I'd recommend it over some other games releasing this time of year.  My biggest issue is just how boring it gets, and really quickly. At first the car explosions, face pummeling, and oil rig destruction is great but that's literally all you do. When you have 9+ large areas to canvas, it becomes tedious, especially trying to collect all the upgrades for the different strongholds in the land. There isn't a lot of difficulty thus far either, and with how quickly you gain upgrades I can't imagine it'll get much harder as time goes on. There's really no sense of urgency or death looming above you as it's easy to keep your tank filled, health high, and ammo stocked.  Either way if you're a fan of the movie you'll probably like this game, but I wasn't a fan of the movie yet I wanted to give the game a chance. Maybe it can at least hold me over until the other wasteland game comes out in November.  Other notes... People seem to be confusing 'well optimized' with 'not very demanding.' This game doesn't have spectacular graphics, at least compared to Arkham Knight which everyone else seems to also be comparing it to. It's also clearly made for consoles, the keyboard/mouse controls are pretty bad. The menus are clunky, space-bar is dodge by default rather than jump, and for some reason I have to hit Q to exit most menus instead of Escape. You can only jump about three inches high and countering during combat has the same Arkham Asylum 'works when it wants to' feel. I've been in battles where I completely perfectly demolish everybody, and that's after I died in the exact same battle where I got completely demolished by everybody.

So the polish is there, the game runs great, the graphicaly is nice.  The game dumps you right into action.... and the driving model is awkward... I guess this is expected. The 'cars' are make-shift conglomerations of scrap parts with V8 in them.  Then we go to combat, it's the exactly same system which was in Batmans and SoM. Sadly the upgrade paths of the fight system aren't as interesting in the former games using this system.  And then we get to the open world parts, and this is the major disappointment.   Sure, the world is dry, desolate and barren as expected. There are some wreckeges which you can scavenge for couple of scrap pieces, and sometimes an 'old-world relic' which is issually a picture of a kid and a dog.  Issue here is that the scrap ammount obtained from these is really low, almost to the point, that it doesn't make sense to scavenge.  There are ubisoftian towers in form of balloons. Issually they are guarded by a terrain traversal puzzle. When you get to the balloon you need to wait til you get high enough then to manually observe the surrounding. Which is nice, but it is quickly becoming a choir.  Other thing I highly dislike are arbitral restrictions on stuf, especially harpoon and upgrades.  I'm getting stoked with my harpoon, tearing down scarecrows and suddenly - (Level X Required). Man, I've just got a special talon thingy to tear down the hinges of the jaw and still can't rip out wheels from random buggies?  Ok, I want to upgrade the harpoon. Oh wait, I need to reduce the threat level on a territory I just left. I need to go back do more more choirs for to gain access to stuff.  You know what game did the exact same thing? Watch Dogs.  Mad Max is Watch Dogs, but with a big of fun, and lots of choir... and sand storms.",

My main problem with this game is the amount of time you need to spend clearing the many side objectives from your map. Its extremely tedious. Plus max doesnt even look like mel gibson or tom hardy, and doesnt even sound remotely australian (neither do any of the characters you come across). Also, why does max need to visit a crazed desert nomad apparition to level up?!  They give you a sidekick though.......a mental hunchback who works on your car, and, as much as his dialog may put a smirk on my face from time to time, his is not needed in this game. It wouldve been more satisfying to play this game without a comic relief side-kick, so that atleast you can feel like the lone badass that max is.  The car combat is quite nice, however, theres only so many times you can rip an enemy out of his vehicle with the grapple hook before that too becomes boring.  You want to know how heal in mad max? Your probably thinking its like the movie where you use bits of useful junk on hand to fasion iv's or some sort of transfusion system. Nope, you drink water....... who knew that being shot or run over could be cured so easily with just a sip of water! -.- Why this game has no multiplayer function is beyond me. It wouldve been brilliant to add a multiplayer element with unique character design and group options, maybe even base building.

            "review_text": "+ graphic and style of the game is fitting to the Mad Max universe + story is mostly good and the characters are as well - ending is anticlimatic as it is completly forced on you not giving you any chance to intervene at any point. You are basically just looking, never get a chance to fully fight Scrotum, and in the end it all just feels very unsatisfying as the last part is full scripted and cinematics. - The story is absolutely linear, no alternate endings, no way to influence anything at all ever -- you may have spent much time and effort ugprading those strongholds and what it does in the end for you is really absolutely 0, nothing, worthless. Games are supposed to give you choice, but this one has none. Whenever you would normally use your unlocked abilities to intervene in what is happening, the main storyline will force some illogical other route of happenings on you if you want it or not. You could as well watch a movie instead of this, in a movie you would also likely not be confronted with the same fights and same bosses over a timespan of multiple hours. -- full of repetitive chores (defusing entire mine fields seriously?) and grinding if you want to upgrade anything to a meaningful degree - full of unskippable, boring cutscenes during simple actions, at least these can be skipped if upgrading max at Griffa - Boss fights are always exactly following the same pattern to defeat the boss, almost all bosses are just reskins - Melee fights make up a large chunk of the game and get boring really fast, you just click two buttons in the right moments repeatedly + Driving and causing havok with your car is fun but... - ...mostly you will destroy other cars by shooting at them instead of ramming them etc., since that is often the fastest and only practical way - Voice acting for Max is ridiculously bad at many many times. At many points it sounded to me like an uninterested body-builder, who is at the very end of the autism spectrum, is voice acting for him. That's also why I never could immerse myself into Max. It is very different from the original Mad Max movies (old ones).  Summary: Overall good, but too much grinding, repetitive fighting, focus on melee, and fully linear story in a relatively open world",

The game looks nice, it's got cars and deserts and fighting and aussies, but I was hoping for some more open-ended gameplay and heavier focus on survival in the post-apocalyptic wasteland instead of what basically boils down to a (bad) WB movie.",
