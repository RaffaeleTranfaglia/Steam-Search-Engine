    "description": "Welcome to StaudSoft's Synthetic World Beta! It allows you via a seed to create a unique landscape with mountains, oceans, trees and beaches. Although it looks like a normal game engine, everything in the game is based on voxels. So everything you see can be changed. You can cut down trees, build a house or dig into the ground!",

            "review_text": "*Reviewed with a Press Key* *EARLY ACCESS 16/05/2015*  So Currently as people have said the game isn't 'Bad' or a 'Scam' but it is lacking in a lot of things that would make it a fun game, the settings don't appear to work properly and the menus are horribly designed as I acidentaly figured out how they work. There's a lot to craft but most of it seems to just be different variants of other objects. I'm not sure what to add due to the lack of content.  Pros - Can pick a world Size - Brilliant size selection of how big or delicate you want to be when digging or placing - Great Terrain deformation  Cons - Initial Load times for a small map are too long - The atmosphere is very dull - Not Much to do - The Optimisation is terrible. - Other games have done it better in EA.  I do see this game becoming something great but the fact other games have done done this exact same thing but much better makes me want to tell you to avoid this game for now, if it takes the correct approach I can see this game being a great success but at the moment games like Rising World are much more worth your money.  I give it currently a 6.5/10 for being intuitive with the pointer but lacking in content.  YouTube Video: Coming Soon",
