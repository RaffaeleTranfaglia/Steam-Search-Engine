    "description": "CivCity: Rome, an innovative city builder inspired by the world of Sid Meiers Civilization, and created by a collaboration between Firefly Studios and Firaxis Games, invites players to shift focus from building a multi-city empire and zoom-in on the great cities of the Roman Empire, culminating in Rome itself!",

            "review_text": "I was a victim of Microsoft's deceptive ''X' means consent' policy for upgrading to Windows 10, and it did cause some problems with this game. The thing is, I'm not too upset with that (in this case), because this game really hasn't held up very well.  I originally bought this from Direct2Drive (before Gamefly killed it), and back then I had a pretty good time with it. So I recently re-bought it on Steam... and like I said, it hasn't held up. The ability to see inside your citizens' houses is nice, but that's really all that this game has going for it. Truth is, there are other games out there that do the same things that CivCity Rome does, but do it better.  If you're short of funds and just want a city builder to mess around with for a few hours (and don't have anything to compare it to), then this game works (Win10 troubles aside). But if you want something a bit more solid, I have a few suggestions:   Imperium Romanum:  If you're looking for a Roman-themed city builder, this one has a day/night cycle, more detailed citizens, better graphics and is overall just a better game (IMO).   Children of the Nile:  All of the above (except it's Egyptian-themed), plus it has a nice ebb and flow to the daily life of your citizens.   Tropico (1, 3, 4 or 5):  You can't go wrong with any version you choose (my preference is 4), with very detailed citizens, more building options, and overall just more stuff to do.  So if you're thinking about buying CivCity Rome, for a little bit of extra coin you'd be better off getting one of these instead. And if you already have one or more of them, by all means do NOT buy it. You won't be impressed.",

            "review_text": "The game has great gameplay, good graphics and good mechanics. The campain of the game is entertaining and as you progress, it does tend to get more and more challenging. You can build huge cities and it does makes you think about building placement. I personally like it because I love Roman history and this game teaches you some of the concepts of how people lived in Ancient Roman society. Downfall is, limited space (after few hours of building your city, you tend to start running out of space). In freebuild mode, trade system is very limited. But overall, the game is very entertaining and I can definetly see myself spend 100s of hours playing this game without a doubt. So far I haven't noticed any bugs, so that means it was well programmed.   Rating: Graphics 7/10  Replayability 9/10  City Managment 10/10   Mechanics 8/10  Strategy 10/10  Campaign 8/10  Battle Mechanics 1/10  Research Tech Tree 4/10  I know this game is old and all, but it would be great if the developers would go back to it and design more stuff and add it as a DLC (which I would definetly buy). Maybe even a multiplayer where you try to sabbotage other cities or help one another with trade.",

I'd hoped to see something soecial from this game which is a decade more recent (or thereabouts) from the 1st Caesar but the graphics are very disappointing and there's some sort of bug which means your workers won't do their jobs. Which means that even with two fire stations fires totally destroyed my second city whilst the firemen did nothing.   To effectively just copy someone else's game without bringing anything new on board is reallyy poor. But to do it very badly too ? I expect a lot better from Firaxis.",

The map editor in CivCity Rome does NOT allow you to make trees/rocks/marable/iron infinite, so you can't build your dream city unless you make 90% of your map resources.  This game tells you whether you have high or low unemployment, but does NOT give you percentages. There is nothing to tell you how much it costs to run each building either.  I asked Steam for a refund on the game, but they wouldn't do it.  I only got 4 hours into the game to realize this game isn't for me.  The only reason I got stuck at 4 hours was because it took a while to figure out the weird mechanics they had for granaries and warehouse buildings.",

It has a mix of both developers such as researching technologies from Firaxis and the city building from Firefly. There is a small portion of combat gameplay but not on a grand scale or as broad as such from the Stronghold or Civ Series.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a sim city builder with the concepts from Firefly and Firaxis.",
