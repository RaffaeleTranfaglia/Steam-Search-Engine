There will be several paths for us to try out on our journey, with the shadow of our doubts slowing us down if we let it. We will inevitably crash and burn many... many times into obstacles that came out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and there will be that one stage that will seem impossible. However, if we have the courage to press that 'retry' button, then eventually we will beat the game. Just remember to never lose sight of your dream, and don't let the sun set on you before you get to the end.   Praise the sun. 10/10",

            "review_text": "Overview: Arcade Racer focused on avoiding obstacles  The Good:  +The game goes on forever, the goal is not only how far you can go but how many points you can get. The premise is that your ship is solar powered, thus staying in the sunlight keeps you going. The sun slowly goes down creating more shadows. Powerups can extend your time.   + Every 24 hours the course is reset. Everything is randomized to a degree forcing you to rely more on skill and luck rather than memorization  + The game gives you a multiple objectives to complete. After completing them your ship gets upgraded.   +VERY addicting, the game has the 'just one more time' feeling to it.   +Steamworkshop is intregrated very nicely with a variety of different maps to try out.   +The game has a unique and simplistic artstyle to it. As the sun sets it creates a really nice setting. After playing some of the user generated maps you really see some of the verstatily of the engine and graphics despite how simple it is.   +Hard mode to really test you to the limit....if you find the main game to easy.  The Bad:  - You will get frustrated....a lot.   Conclusion  This is a really fun and simple game was a simple premise and works wonderfully due to the randomness of the world. Its a game you can keep going back to and play in short sessions.  ",

            "review_text": " A peaceful runner-style game where you guide a solar powered craft through an ever more shadowy obstacle course.   From experience of driving towards the sun, you wouldn't think much of a game that focuses on flying towards the sun. Why would I want to do that? The sun is bright and makes my eyes hurt. This game is a fun way to use our imagination, and enjoy ourselves in a solar powered aircraft. If it helps, presume that you are wearing sunglasses, perhaps even fashionable ones. Do you feel cool? Are you prepared to look directly at bright lights? Fantastic.  I imagine this takes place in a sad, dystopic future devoid of fine art or literature, where fossil fuels and other natural resources have been exhausted. All that remains are a few mostly abandoned cities, the wilds between, and due to the political turmoil of resource starvation, the world is on the eve of annihilation.   Enter our protagonist, a strong silent individual. You're transporting yourself and a motley crew of rogues, miscreants, and iconoclast scientists aboard a solar-powered plane last-ditch effort to survive the imminent nuclear annihilation and attempt to prolong the death of a dying world much as a doctor extends the lives of those with chronic diseases. Specifically, you have a technology, a solar powered technology that is also built into your very aircraft. This technology opens portals to new worlds, and any one of them could be the paradise awaiting the future of humanity. Occasionally a bird approaches to aid you on your quest, as if nature itself is encouraging you in your quest.  Every once in a while you find structure capable of powering these warp gates and moving through them transports you to strange, fanciful, wonderful, and potentially terrible lands. Are any of these places inhabitable? It is unlikely, but any leap into the unknown could eventually show you the future of our species. There is such limited time though. This is certainly the last day before the missiles launch, and that means that when your plane falls to the ground at dusk, the world is lost.  Controls are simple. You turn left, you turn right, you jump when you've got the right power up, and there's also a powerup which allows you to accidentally crash into a wall without dying. Throughout you pick up stars that increase your speed. You may note that speed will keep the sun higher on the horizon for longer periods of time. You can do a barrel roll as well.  If the sun sets you run out of power and die. If you collide with sufficient force, you die. The difficulty ramps up nicely as well, so that death, which comes to us all, may always be delayed a bit longer. There's a couple of starting levels of differing difficulty, and a workshop with extras, as well as an expansion that I have not tried as of yet.   You level up by doing things like not turning left for a while, or being good at not hitting stuff, or collecting a lot of stuff in the air. These levels give you things like a magnet that makes it so you pick up stuff easier, or a battery that lets you survive in the shadows better. You can also put stickers on your plane, which alone with the portals is the closest thing to visual texture in the game.   This game is grey scale polygons everywhere. Grey pyramids? Probably trees or mountains depending on scale? Grey rectangular prisms I imagine are buildings. There are some that look like shrubbery or boulders. The aesthetic is minimalist and produced a light feeling of ennui. There is quality lighting and shadow, which is fantastic as these are actually used as gameplay mechanics. Different modes have differing color schemes, and the apocalyptic mode is especially pleasant to view.  The sounds are quite nice. The music is of limited quantity, but the quality is apparent and it elicits an appropriate response.  If you have an imagination, or just want something of variable relaxation and pace, something of an original concept, then this could be quite an enjoyable original addition for you. Personally I gave it my full attention for several relaxing enjoyable hours.   This review has been produced in accordance with green technologies, specifically the aeronautical technologies behind solar powered propulsion. These machines are often light weight fully electric craft and represent an important engineering challenge for developing technologies for cleaner, cheaper aircraft.

Each region has a distinct visual style, making you want to explore it, but there's no way to go too far off the path, and the repetitive nature within a level makes it hard to remember what comes next. Upgrades are tied to a series of achievements, some trivial, others frustrating, but always having three current ones makes it fairly easy to climb quickly.  My children, too, love it, partly for the thrill of seeing a place they've never been able to get to before, and partly for the flashy barrel rolls. Granted, they die even more often than I do, but that makes it even easier to prefix a request with 'Okay, the next time you die, ...'",

            "review_text": "Race the Sun is a type of forever runner game that has you piloting a flightless hover ship as it glides along a minimalist desert of walls, triangle spikes and blocks that fall over. Your ship is solar powered and going too far into shadows will slow you down and with the sun setting in the horizon itself, that turns the sun into a timer. Slamming into an object is failure, but you can graze an edge of your ship and be fine for a while.  On the surface, there's nothing wrong with the game, its easy to play, left and right to steer and well left and right to steer. It takes a moment for your ship to shift. The controls are simple and work well with a keyboard or 360 controller. You can do things like barrel rolls if you steer too far one way then hard turn it the other way. You can even unlock a single jump and other upgrades for your ship like a magnet that draws in orbs.  The game is shallow and even worse it relies on only one level for the most part. This single level resets itself each day. New day, new level. Other than that, you can unlock two additional levels and even play a credits level that has you flying under the credits in what feels like a flat open space with no challenge rather than an actual level.  Because its just one level, and the game never modifies itself, it makes the game feel like its more about memory than skill. Sure it takes skill to move between two falling blocks, but it takes memory to remember that you can just drive around the wall to a much easier path.  Each level consists of different regions and each region seems to be a loop of itself twice. Well loop with some extras thrown in. As if someone copied and pasted then added some extra fluff. Between each region a white bird will zig-zag and drop four orbs one direction and four orbs another direction. Then it will drop a sun orb which surges your ship to its top speed. You'll find several blue orbs, sun orbs and green jump orbs throughout each level. There are ramps here and there that let you catch big air, falling blocks and shadows to slow you down. The funny thing is you can jump off a ramp high over orbs and it will still collect them if you touch the beam of light over them. Perhaps that's an unlocked feature. Its about as bare bones as it comes to runners.  You'll find portal gates that for whatever reason send you into space where you have a view from the cockpit. The game plays much slower and everything is black. You get to see a galactic space battle in black and white as you fly through it dodging lesser vessels as they zoom by. It feels out of place at best and only makes the game feel a lot easier going so slow. If we're still piloting the same ship when we're in the portal, am I still powered by the sun? Where is the sun in space? I sure can't see the sun.  In the main game itself you can change the camera view from a behind chase cam to a bumper view. Inside the galactic space battle, you're stuck in the cockpit, pressing the camera view button shifts the view by a few pixels. its odd that the game shifts at all when its that small of a difference.  There's a leveling up mechanic that has you accomplishing three goals to get to the next level. Getting to level eleven and twenty-five unlock new levels, but to get there you'll need to do things like jump ten times and do twenty barrel rolls in a single play. The further you go, the more challenging these goals become. Its definitely a way to add some longevity to a shallow game that feels like little to no effort was put in. The entire game feels like no effort was put in and its really the players that need to put time into the game. I want to play here, not work here.  To the game's credit, it looks great. The minimalist approach enhances the game and my enjoyment of it. It makes good use of a dynamic lighting system. The sun casts shadows, although some of the shadows seem to be painted on hazards to hurt your time. Even with a sun, some levels are just gray. Yes indeed, two-hundred and fifty-five shades of gray monochromatic action. Of course a level can be any color, I just seem find gray levels.  Race the Sun has a level editor and Steam workshop integration, so you can always find new levels. I took one look at the level editor, saw how deep it is and then closed it. I've learned so many other level editors that its tough to justify putting time into this one. The real problem is why is that our job as players to make new levels? Sure its fun to create levels, publish them and rate them, but as a developer why are we stuck with one level per day on the computer version of what is essentially a mobile game? That sort of mechanic is what keeps people coming back and sitting through ads day after day and not people that paid money.  Speaking of paying money and mobile ports, on the start screen, they have DLC, the soundtrack and the mobile version to buy. That's understandable, a lot of bigger games, non indie games with shareholders often use this tactic right front and center and fans let them know it. Race the Sun is immune to this and people still manage to love the game for its brief and addictive gameplay. For a game that sells a soundtrack, why is there only one song? This whole game seems like a big cash grab.  There's so little here that its a starvation and so the game keeps you coming back for more with daily courses. You keep coming back to get your moneys worth, to get that quick shallow fix and move on with life knowing that level you spent an hour memorizing and mastering will never appear again. Your work, effort and bragging rights are replaced by tomorrow's level. A chance to wake up and do it all over again.  While I hate to judge a game for everything but the game, there's just not much game here. you go left, you go right, take a ramp. remember what you did wrong. Wash; rinse; repeat.",

But in Race the Sun it does. The 24 hour world resets strike a great balance between getting the chance to practice and perfect something, while always having something new to try each day. Also, unlike the side scrollers in the genre, RtS offers a degree of movement freedom that actually scratches something of an exploration itch in me.",

Control is good, only left, right and action button. The default tracks are refreshed every week so you won't get bored, though it just retrack the obstacles.  The thing I don't like is the gamepad navigation is awful. Example like in main menu, i have to try really hard to get the cursor to move to the option menu. I had to rely on mouse for navigation. The soundtrack are pretty plain.  If you're planning for a short-burst game or just wanna have relaxed game, this can be a good choice.   How long can you go before the sun goes down?",

Your objective is simple, your controls are simple, and your environment should match, especially given that this is a a fast reflex and short-term planning game. Complexity would only create more problems in the way of hitbox management and identification. Immersion, as a result, is minimal yet engaging.

This game is a basically a racing / dodging game, you are trying to race the sun in your solar power vehicle. The sun is setting in the distance, casting shadows on the scenery in your way. The lower the sun, the longer the shadows, and whilst your vehicle is powered by the sun, entering the shadows = slower speed. This itself might be an advantage as the game runs along at a hell of a pace and thou' early levels you will dodgy the scenery with ease, later levels it gets MUCH more difficult.   If the sun sets, it's game over, if you hit the scenery (most likely) its game over. Along the way there are power ups to collect, some increase your score multiplier, some buy you a bit more time, some offer you a shield, some offer a jump facility (usually good for getting out of trouble).   The maps are randomly generated, there are 'objectives' that help you raise the level of your craft which gives you various additional perks. The genius of this game is the maps are randomly generated every 24 hours!. So today's level/game is nothing like yesterdays and wont be the same tomorrow. The random maps are the same for everybody (if that makes sense, so yes the map is random, but someone playing on the same day as you has the same level).   There is a learning curve; however, with repeated attempts you do get better and progress. It's good for a quick blast. A 20 minute filler game, which is different everytime you play it (so long as you play it on different days) :D ",

            "review_text": "For all the grand adventures and intricate experiences that video games have to offer nowadays, sometimes it’s the older and simpler ideas that stick in the mind the most. You may share similar memories to me; ones of heading to websites such as Miniclip, and playing those little games which consisted of dodging and weaving a spaceship round the many blocks and obstacles that came hurtling in your direction. It was good, clean fun.   Well, Race the Sun doesn’t really try and disguise the fact that at its core it’s basically offering more of the same. Still, that’s not a bad thing – the concept remains fun even today, whether you are wearing the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia or not. It continues to be satisfying to watch your score go up and up as you expertly weave your way through the narrowest of gaps, all the while experiencing that jolt in your stomach as you brush far too close to your death. Even when you inevitably turn into a fine mist, the feeling you can always do better compels you to hit that restart button and so through the whole process again.   Race The Sun manages to easily pull all those emotions out of you, but goes on to amplify them via the added spice of challenging you to stay one step ahead of a setting sun, all via the means of collecting certain power –ups and staying out of the shadows. This makes it so you have to be taking more risks if you want to survive for any extended period of time, meaning those exciting near death moments come at such a rapid pace it certainly keeps the blood pumping. It’s a cool little mechanic.  That’s not the only thing different that Race the Sun adds to the table, either. There’s also a list of challenges to complete, varying from reaching certain distances to performing a number of risky manoeuvres, where success slowly levels you up. With new levels come new power-ups or the means to improve your high scores, and then the cycle beings anew. The fact the game generates a new world to try every day is another nice feature – each generated landscape sticks around long enough to give you a good amount of time to truly master it, but not long enough for things to get ever get stale. None of these ideas are mind-blowing, I concur, but they’re enough to keep you coming back to the game once the appeal of high score chasing wears thin. With Steam Workshop additionally seeing people generate some truly crazy levels, the game’s lifespan extends far beyond when you’d probably initially expect.   Things aren’t entirely perfect, mind you. Some of those aforementioned challenges the game throws up at you feel blatantly more difficult when compared to the rest, and a bunch of the rewards you’ll get for completing them are basically inferior compared to those that you unlocked many a level ago. While not frequent in the slightest, I’ve also had a few occasions where I’ve encountered a death which felt downright unfair – either I’ve suddenly found myself flying at an impenetrable wall of stone, or power-ups don’t appear anywhere near the frequency you need them to in order to viably stay alive.   The menus also achieve something remarkable in the sense they’re both very basic and oddly confusing – the ability to customise your ship’s wings is not advertised very well, for instance, and I’ve had moments where joypad button prompts kept popping up even though I was using a keyboard and mouse. The fact you can’t restart after dying if using a joypad (forcing you to reach over and do it with your mouse) is also something that may seem tiny, but becomes so incredibly frustrating over extended play it’s impossible to ignore.   The question that perhaps sprung into your mind at the start of this review, of course, is why you should be buying this game when I’ve highlighted there’s so many free alternatives online. It’s a fair enough question... But in response, I would state that Race the Sun does things so well, and implements its own ideas in a way that keeps you truly interested, that I honestly think it’s worth your time and money. I was pleasantly surprised by how much entertainment I got out of it, and I think you will be too. Just don’t go beating my scores. ",

I played it a few times after buying it, and haven't touched it since nor had any inclination to. Once you've played it a few times then that's it, you've exhausted the variety of the game - there's nothing left to discover other than how far you can get into the game. You'll never uncover anything new in terms of the gameplay. You just might see a few more types of object to dodge.  Sure, the layout of each level changes every 24 hours. Sure, some people have created quite a variety of levels in the workshop. However, it all boils down to the same very simple game - dodge until you die.

            "review_text": "Race The Sun is a good game, and you can probably tell whether you'll like it by the screenshots and videos on the Steam page, but, in case you're not sure, allow me to elaborate.  I think the goal of the game is fairly obvious, you need to race the sun with a solar-powered spacecraft. The theme is not just a gimmick though: since some obstacles in the game project shadows, you will sometimes not be able to see the sun, and that will slow you down, meaning that the sun will set faster in the horizon. Basically, every mistake you make has an immediate and tangible effect on the game.   The controls are tight and responsive, and the hitboxes seem logical and fair most of the time (if you die, it's most likely your fault and not the game's). Plus, the view distance is not infinite, but good enough for you to be able to spot obstacles and react to them in time.  The 'real' goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible by collecting 'tris', which are basically score multipliers. For every five tris you get, your multiplier will go up by one, but if you bump sideways into something you lose one. You lose the game when you crash into an obstacle or if your craft's battery is depleted due to lack of exposure to direct sunlight.  There are some collectible items you can find as well, which can increase your speed temporarily, allow you to jump, skip the level or save you if you crash into something.  A final thing to keep in mind is that there are some mini challenges that you need to complete in order to level up, which will, in turn, unlock collectibles, give you ship upgrades, a better starting multiplier, decals for your ship or make your existing upgrades better. I got to the maximum level in about 8 hours, but that's not where the game exhausts its content.  If you wish to keep playing, there are plenty of things to keep you occupied: first off, the main game's world is reset every 24 hours, which means you have some time to learn the various obstacles during the day, but you will get a new challenge after you're done with it.   Secondly, there are two other modes, one that is a considerably more difficult version of the standard world and another one that is actually a beatable maze, which I found to be a really cool alternative take on the core gameplay.  And, last but not least, you can find some special portals on the levels, and those portals will lead you to an 'alternate universe', which is basically a user-created level. And yes, there is an editor, of course.  That's quite a bit of stuff for an indie game, right? Now, when it comes to the audiovisual aspects of the game, the graphics are really simple and streamlined (and, let's face it, somewhat outdated) but they have their charm, especially if you enjoy a 'zen' sci-fi aesthetic.  While the basic colors are gray, orange and white, the alternate worlds are much more varied and explosive in their visuals and can range from dying planets blowing up in front of you to star wars-esque space battles.  The game's music begins as a calm but focused tune which slowly ramps up in intensity as the sun goes down, finishing in a downright violent manner in the later levels. It might get a little tiring after a while, but I find it to be pleasant to listen to either way.  I think that's it, if you like racing, obstacle courses or simply want a new indie game to kill a few minutes every day with, this is definitely a good and cost-efficient choice.",

There are also pickups that extend the time it takes for the sun to set helping you keep your sun energy high and I enjoyed this teeter-totter style play where I frequently shift my eyes all around the screen hunting for pickups while trying to concentrate on my ship and the obstacles ahead. The maps are also generated daily and this keeps the replayability levels quite high whether you play for a few runs a day or hours at a time.  In short: I'd rate it around a 7.

You do the same thing, pilot a ship through uninteresting white terrain with obstacles, and you gain increased points and then you die and you have to restart the entire thing over again. It is not randomized and you will just redo the same terrain and area you just did, making it feel super repetitive. The controls of the ship aren't good enough or tight enough that they demand. Trying both the keyboard and a gamepad, the ship takes a bit to get moving, and then one you start it moving it takes a while to stop or switch course. It just feels too heavy and not as responsive as it should be, leading to many undeserved deaths. Yes you can keep grinding and finally get to much later levels, but 5-10 min without a single mistake is kind of dumb to ask, although some people like it I guess, judging from the reviews. There is only one mode unless you grind for a while, and the free mode they should have included as free update/DLC they instead charge for. You complete tasks while playing to gain little abilities, but things like the magnet don't even seem to work much, and others are just more pickups that let you jump once or speed you up for a second, hardly changing things. At once point I was doing well and all of a suddent a plane appeared right above me and dropped a bomb that covered the screen in white and I did. There was nothing I could do to stop from dying, and being killed by something I had never seen and force me to start from scratch just seems dumb. This game encourages grinding and doesn't have much to offer. Really not enough here to differentiate it from a free game, so just go to  addictinggames.com  and save yourself the money.",

The developers, despite what I'm sure were good intentions, have made the game - if not   impossible   to play, then at least annoying to the extreme. Flippfly appears to have little regard for player imput, or indeed, play choice in how to play the game. They have implemented sounds that, if you find them annoying as I do, and want to turn them off - too bad. You'll have to turn off all game sound to mute the whiring, overheated computer fan sound of your engine.   But I can deal with that. No, the reason for the negative review is the breaking of the game by compulsory community maps. I'm all for community participation in games, but when you are   forced   to play maps off the workshop, the game becomes frustrating and broken. They are either overcomplicated, unintuitive, or simply completely broken - one places you in what I imagine the creator was a 'cinematic' view, which has the kind of serious flaw of completely dislocating you from your ships position, resulting in crashes where you thought you shouldn't have been.  Despite continual complaints against this forced participation and lack of player adjustablity, Flippfly has refused to even acknowledge there is a problem. If and when they fix these issues, I'll more than happily recommend this game to any-and-everyone. Until then, though, I can only recommend it if you're looking for a frustrating, unoptimizable, and, as a product of the two, broken game.",

But first of all, there are advancement levels to be gained through solving challenges, as well as additional achievements to be reached for, with plenty of emotions to be had along the way. Obtaining further levels opens road to the technological implementations and features, which empower the experience and final score. Eventually new modes of play are enabled.  The game looks conceptually coordinated with the solar craft riding against the setting sun, the death-timer. The action is placed within an Egyptian-like minimalistic desert environment. Nevertheless, there are also beautiful side-worlds to be discovered - milk and honey, if you are persistent and lucky. Speaking of the basic map, a new scheme is generated each day, with a new leaderboard to be settled for it.   Race the Sun  is perhaps a perfect speedrunning game in the futuristic abstract tone with minimalist design style. 8/10 wHATs grade. Definitely recommendable to those who want to feel the vibe of screen image shaking under the impact of acceleration.",

It's difficult to describe my thoughts on it, and I also don't think it's necessary. This is a MUST OWN, it's really that simple. And then complexity comes, when you try to describe it. Let's start with the obvious.  You have your solar powered craft, the setting sun in the background and obstacles in front of you. When you complete a set of obstacles, you arrive at a new region, which will certainly be far more cruel and unforgiving that the previous. You have a variety of power- ups, the yellow beacon thingy is the most important one, since, and this is where the 'race the sun' part comes, the sun, as I said, is setting and your craft is solar powered. The yellow power- up will speed you up, prolonging your pathetic death, just long enough to see yourself plunge into an obstacle at an utterly insane speed, all because of your suddenly malfunctioning reflexes. But that's OK, you could always momrize the terrain and each obstacle, right? Nope. The people that made the game are actually so cool, that they are changing the game World every 24 hours. It may be similar to the World from yesterday, but it may be completely different. There is also a Portal World, which is also different every day. It may be a relaxing one, like, for example, observing a space battle. Or it may be one of those Portal Worlds that keep you on the edge of your seat, praying for a successful exit. They recently added a labyrinth mode, which is very fun to play and will really test your reflexes. The Sunrise DLC is absolutely worth buying.  In conclusion, you have a perfect gameplay, a real challenge, amazing soundtrack, new World every 24 hours, Leaderboards, ship customization and a loss of words, upon witnessing perfection.",

Certain missions may be easier on certain days, but it's still mainly an exercise of skill and memorizing a path.  The visuals, sound, atmosphere are all excellent, as other reviews put it. The controls are tight and the game feels fair once you have some experience.

You can play pretty much with every controller as well, because the controls are pretty simple.

Also, there's Steam workshop, it's not that popular game, but there's few maps to try out and try to complete.  Cons: As much as I love the leveling system at this game, it's boring that it's very easy to get to max level in just few hours. Then the game becomes more like 'I just want to play it for relaxing', not 'I want to complete this game now' -kind of game.  -------------------  There was The Steam Awards competition in 2016, where you could choose a game to each category  I chose this game to ' The “Test of Time” Award ', because this is actually the game that I have big pauses between my game sessions, but the game that I have played since 2011 (yes, even before it came to Steam), and it is always as relaxing as it was the first time I played it.

First off, you should watch both trailers so that you understand a little bit about how the game looks by watching someone play it. They both sum up what things look like very well. I'll write my review first from a mechanics aspect and end with an aesthetic aspect  Controls: The controls for race the sun are very simple and, I think, intuitive. Arrow keys make you turn right and turn left; Space bar is jump. They are remapable though I'm not sure I would ever want to. Controllers are supported, but the game plays just fine with the arrow keys. I'm pretty twitchy from playing shooters and RTS though. You can tap the arrow key at varying speeds and get performance similar to a joystick or controller. I've never found the controls to blame for any of my deaths after about the first 15 minutes  Learning curve: Race the Sun introduces a leveled progression throughout this otherwise arcade style game. Your first run is very simple: Dodge things, and try to hit the yellow speed boosts. As you advance, power-ups like jumps, world portals, emergency portals (a get out of dying free card) and even portals that instantly warp you to the end of that level start to appear. You level up in an interesting way: by completing challenges that the game poses for you, ranging from simple (like jumping 10 times) to complex, like only turning left for two regions (levels) in a run. You have three at any time, and the simpler ones are often worth less, but makes it so that you can always progress. By introducing these new features one at a time, you can get to grips with the new one instead of the game dropping a lot of confusing stuff on your head.  Customization: Another consequence of the leveling system is that the game rewards you with mods for your flyer. They do a variety of things from increasing the amount of jumps you can hold, to letting you grab power ups from farther away, to turning faster. It's a nice way to tailor your craft to how you like to play. Additionally, you'll get the ability later on to choose multiple to equip.  Procedural Content Generation: The levels in Race the Sun are procedurally generated. Under normal circumstances, this would probably be infuriating, because every time you crashed you'd have to learn a new world (you'll crash often). However, Race the Sun generates the same world for everyone, probably based on number sequence for each day to act as the seed for the generator. There's no downloads involved, and you can play instantly when you boot up the game or play offline anytime. Since the levels are generated, you can also go as far right or left as you want.   Graphics: Simple, yet good enough. Shadows are dynamic based on the height of the sun, and actually imact the play of the game. After all, your craft is solar powered. Most things are simple hedron shapes, but it looks good enough that the graphics don't ever distract me. Besides, since the sun is always in front of you, you usually only see the dark side of objects. Occasionally you can blind yourself in the sunlight (it halos nicely when you're staring straight into it) obscuring things around you but is never bright enough to actually blind you.  Gameplay: I think the game is fun as hell. As you can figure from the youtube trailer, you move FAST. You will miss things by next to nothing. You'll crash often trying to catch that one speed boost that you know you can't make and it will only be your fault. I've never found myself blaming the game for a death. The games are the perfect length to hop on and play one between doing other things.   10/10: Perfect execution on what it set out to do. Doesn't try to do too much. Looks good, plays better. ",

Race The Sun (Flippfly﻿) has an interesting mechanic, whereby your solar-powered vehicle will slow down if it's in the shade, and you can only go so far—period—because the sun is setting. It uses a progression mechanic based on completing various objectives (collecting power-ups, getting your score multiplier to a particular level, making it through stages without any collisions, etc.), and since you have 3 different objectives available at any time, there's usually SOMETHING you can make progress on…  …until you can't, because you're terrible at racing games and your reflexes just can't make the cut (and by 'you're', I really mean 'I'm'). I guess this is what I get for not playing any racing games since F-Zero﻿ on the SNES (1991) and Mario Kart 64﻿ on the N64 (1997).",

Does this mean the PS4 is just a better gaming platform than the PC? I'd have to conclude yes.  That aside, race the sun is a decent little game that you'll get your fun out of. It isn't mind blowing stuff and you might be able to spend your time elsewhere on a deeper experience, but you could do worse.",

Quick edit: Make sure you set your dedicated graphics to run it on a laptop. Even then, it isn't really very well optimised, the antialiasing is a joke and forcing it up in nvidia control panel cripples performance on my low end, but definitely capable GT 740M @ 1366x768.  Runs poorly on my tablet (it's a mobile game..), Surface Pro 3.  A decent Linux support on good hardware, thanks a lot for that.",

            "review_text": "This game is a lot more fun than the description and screenshots make it out. It is a racing game crossed with a bullet-storm game (especially in apocalypse mode) with a very rapid respawn rate. The rapidly repeatable difficult courses and challenges gives this game an old-school feeling, in that it relies on muscle memory.   I died probably 100 times within the first hour I played in apocalypse (hard) mode. Then I finally got through the first region, and that little bird that normally drops power-ups dumped a brick on my head. Considering it was apocalypse mode, I thought it was funny and oddly fitting.   (+) The penalty for dying is merely about 1 second before restarting from region 1. This quick turn around time makes the frequent deaths surprising tolerable.  (+) You can level up (gain upgrades to your ship) by accomplishing special tasks. These special tasks can be difficult, but again the quick respawn time makes this more fun than frustrating. These two game mechanics complement each other perfectly.  (+) This game makes it easy to have the maximum framerate, even from lightweight hardware. Trust me, you'll need 60+ fps to effectively play this game.  (?) Race the Sun's spectactal performance comes at the cost that the majority of the graphics are overly simplistic. I cannot mark this as a negative, because it could be a stylistic choice.   (?) Rather than make a half hearted attempt at a story, this game completely forgoes the story all together. I consider no story better than a terrible story, so again, I cannot really say this is a negative.  (?) The environment is surpisingly predictable. Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing. With how often you will die, this actually allows you to make progress in an otherwise difficult game.  (-) Lacks multiplayer play. However, this game does have a leaderboard so you can see how well you do compared to other players.  If Race The Sun had beautiful graphics (while maintaining its high framerate) and multiplayer, then I would go so far as to claim Race The Sun is some sort of analog to a modern day NES Contra with combat replaced with racing. Its not quiet a perfect analogy, but I highly recommend this game if you miss games that give that old-fashioned muscle memory based-skill.",

The idea of mixing an endless runner with one that randomly changes is quite a good one. It gives you enough time to practice and perfect a race through, while using the random generation to prevent it becoming monotonous.  The levels that are generated look very nice. It all has a minimalistic look to it, but there are specific styles of level that are created. You do begin to start to no longer notice the appearance and instead see everything as just obstacle / clear area.  There isn't all that much to the game itself. It's quite simple. You can unlock new modifiers to play with, or use content from the workshop, but there will come a point when you've exhausted all that.  I would tend to say that this is a good game. It's quite simple at its core, but it is a good endless runner / racing game.",
