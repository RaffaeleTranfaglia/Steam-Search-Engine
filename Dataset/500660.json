            "review_text": "Unrealistic and barely fun.  First, the graphics of the surrounding is good. But the hands/gloves are tiny. First immersion breaker.  The sound of the chainsaw is garbage. There are no effects when sawing off wood (nvidia gpu physx could have helped) and there is no real sawing involved at all. Stuff just dissapears and spawns. Easily and just roughly scripted. The chainsaw is often not steady enough and glitches around, even two handed.  I dont see a the challenge at all.   Best part about this game was throwing the chainsaw in the water.",
