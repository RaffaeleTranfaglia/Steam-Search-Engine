The developers really made improvements all around, from the menus, to the characters, to gameplay and modes.. etc. Def worth the buy, would love to see more people on playing again, I know my crew will be. Great job *cha-chiing!*",

            "review_text": "Cubemen 2 is a stark improvment from the first Cubmen. With new units, maps, and slightly different AI. It's a new experience for any RTS player. The campaign is in my opinion still unbalanced, but not as bad as the first Cubemen. The textures and menus are better than the first cubemen. And the skins and themes are a fun adition as well. I like the updated GUI and teleporter and medic station features. Overall the gameplay is good and entertaining, however I reccomend the freeplay mode more than anything else.  Sadly, like the first cubemen, the multiplayer is sullen and empty. It's totally useless.   The level editor is a load of fun and there are many published maps to play.   The game is decent for the price, especially when your an avid RTS player.  Overall; the game is a LOT better than the first Cubemen, 8/10",

It isn't intense yet it is so nice to just click buttons and watch people fight to the death. Something about that excites me. This game is so intense but relaxing I give it a 9/10",
