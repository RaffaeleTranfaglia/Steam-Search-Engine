            "review_text": "Long time player of NS1, briefly of NS2. I played on G4B2S, 187combat, NSArmslab, BadClan servers. My thoughts on this release as of 11/1/2014. They've sucked the fun out of combat. Anything of actual fun in the game is gated behind 'level requirements'. Nevermind the fact you have the skillpoints to use these abilities, nope. Aliens are heavily affected by this basically rendering all their upper tier abilities a joke. Xenocide is a joke, by the time you get the ability you might as well go onos because you won't be getting those nice 6+ kills from the ns1 3.0 days. Even stuff like bile bomb, or spore are stuck behind level requirements even if you have the lifeform and points.  NS2: Combat suffers from the same issue that NS2 did. It's a pretty looking, but poorly executed, boring conversion of a great half life 1 mod.  ",

            "review_text": "Like so many videogames of this genre the aliens as real life creatures would be ludicrous. In Natural Selection II, things work with drama dialled right up, and it's amid this cute Moba of relentless peril that Faultline Games has taken the Natural Selection II Universe once again following in the intimidating footsteps of Unknown Worlds, and produced a fast paced version of the incredibly fun game: Natural Selection II.  NS2: Combat takes the Gorge, Lerk, Fade, Onos, and Skulk back to its roots with a story set prior to the events. On paper it sounds like a foolhardy idea to create this type of gameplay, however with a whole charisma of new technology and tech trees enabling gamers to define each alien or marine played has begged the question, could you have fun with NS2: Combat? It is more of the same style as a Moba/RTS/FPS, but in the best way imaginable.  'Boom! Level up!, ' The Combat narrative is pretty meaty stuff too, set in the heart of various outposts setup to defend planets from a hostile race, The hopes are to irradiate the humans from the invading forces, and from the other perspective to remove the Kharaa life forms from its facilities. The game could have quite easily been a counter-strike romp from A to B, dispatching the same abilities for each character, but instead there's a strong levelling system allowing each player to uniquely identify and create their own style of gameplay using the new levelling system.  The cannon recently added in as the marine Super-weapon has the effect of the Quake 2 Rail-gun. The largest alien - The Onos is written off as a freak; a bizarre creature, a menace. Chatter among aliens roaming the gloomy corridors and ventilation system reveals marine locations and working as a team can allow you to show up on the scene and prove that you are in fact all too real, that is; If you make your kill. Being able to act as an alien to blow yourself up in hopes to take out the enemy is quite fun. There are no 'wave respawns' but yet cool down timers for each player individually.  Like the first combat version of Natural Selection, the game is about tactics, map awareness, and lane blocking. Adding thought into each potential engagement with your teammates is vitally important. Although essentially the series' core game play mechanics remain untouched, with a few tweaked gadgets such as the welder adding the abilities to open and close areas on maps, allowing dynamic changing of strategies for both teams. The new additions of teleporters allow aliens to build up offensive structures behind such teleporters to ensnare marines immediately through passing thus removing again another lane. Of course, sending a heavily armored Chaingun/Railgun 'Mech-Warrior' ( Exo Suit ) to blast away any structure to stand in their way can be helpful to the marines.  NS2: Combat is still largely comprised of offensive exploration, free flow combat and teamwork: Instead of familiarity breeding contempt, this game somehow feels fresh. Even when you bump into an alien you have seen a million times before, playing against that alien on a new map gets the blood flowing as you can quickly feel the need for retaliation thus you can run the same route over to show them who's boss. There's nothing quite like getting the blood of vengeance into someone who's killed you over and over again.   The map 'Kestrel' is an outpost caked in rust and decay, ruled by two opposing forces, the TSF marines, and the Kharaa aliens. Utilizing Jetpacks, and regenerating armor allows more stealth play. Aliens can also make themselves completely invisible and watch you as you drop a marine transporter in hopes to have everyone use it to eliminate the alien threat. This game is a cauldron of deception in tactics, and as each team works hard in thwarting off each other, the more powerful each player gets.  If anything, late game, there are more large aliens the size of dinosaurs devouring one human after another, and yet they cower behind corners due to the sheer firepower of a marine-driven Exosuit. If that wasn't bad enough, you have flying aliens releasing coarse gas which burns the lungs of any marine within it's AOE. There is an abundant raft of upgrade options available to you as you reach the higher levels.   On top of all of this is an improved and more optimized set of source code in which Faultline Games(FLG) gets to prove their credentials, as the great and much-vaunted NS2: Combat offers better performance and scalability than ever before. Constantly reviewing server data to tweak the balance of gameplay ensures you don't connect to a game and start from Level 1. It will appropriately place you where it feels you would best fit in. More features are being added in and NS2: Combat is fully moddable.  NS2: Combat is not without its frustrations however, and some of the alien encounters and marine battles can prove trying at certain junctures. The balance needs a small overhaul which is set to be hotfixed November 11th, and locating a server close to you can be difficult if you live overseas. As the game progresses in time, and as more gaming communities and players get on board after launch, there is no doubt that this game will continue increasing in sales. The current result is entertaining and the ultimate outcome will be seeing more people create friendships in the Natural Selection II Universe..   On top of a generously multiplayable game labelled as 'Natural Selection II'; I question myself: Is NS2: combat a unique enough proposition from Natural Selection II which can stand out as its own game? Yes. The reason for this is simple.  The CEO for UnknownWorlds Entertainment said it perfectly. ' I wish to see people create their own games from Natural Selection II, just as I created Natural Selection from Half-Life.'. NS2: Combat was developed by an indie company start-up using their own personal funding to license from Unknown Worlds and create NS2: Combat.  NS2: Combat - Another Moba/rts/fps combat style that demands to be played. ",

            "review_text": "34 hours of key fire charged fun! (and I many more to come)  DISCLAIMER: I got my copy from the 96 hour mega stream for free, but before you think this swayed my opinion read 'THE TEST'  THE GOOD: The game play is crazy fun with a ton of intence down to the wire moments, and as a resualt people tend to put aside there differences and work as a team leading to only more fun!   This 'High Octane' combat mixed with the diversity of evolution buffs/ weapon upgrades can lead to a single player turning the tide for finding a new and effective stratage or a team working together to complement eachothers strengths to overwelm the enemy leading to crushing defeats or jaw droping 'in the nick of time' victorys  In other words everything it takes to make a fun and refreshing FPS/Moba title.  THE BAD: There is a VERY low population in this game at the moment (over time I have seen it slowly start to grow but at a snails crawl at best) so unless more people find out about this game and soon it will probably die before it can get its own community :(   Do to this low population your fun can sometimes be spoiled when a Very High skilled player(s) uses a weapon/evolution that is a little over powered i.e: gorge bile or Marine jetpack to Stop you over and over with no change from the stratage no diversity no fun the problem only amplifys if his teamates start using it too.  Lack of content is another issue with the game (one that I have been told is in the works to be resolved) the gameplay can be a ton of fun and diverse like crazy, but seeing the same setting over and over can make it a bit old.  THE TEST: An awful lot of NS2 vets have been kindof bashing this game with out giving new players a chance to play the game and decide for them selfs if its good or not (to a lesser extent as time goes on, but at launch it was crazy) so I decided to find out if the lack of enjoyment was just trolls being trolls or if people were actualy not enjoying the game.  so I decided I would test this theory out of my own pocket, and purchased 11 copys of the game and sent them to people the split being below  (4 of my IRL friends 1 Mill sim player 1 fps player and 2 casual gamers) (then to members of a small youtube group I   am friends with 1 fps player 2 MMO players)(and then some random people on my friends list mostly  tf2 players) for a totaly of 12 copys   I then invited them all to a small server with no other players (to prevent vet contamination) and we played a few games for roughly an hour than I asked them all to leave the game and tell my if from that experience 11 people with little or no experience playing with eachother (out side of the groups they were in) and 9 of the 11 players said they would love to buy the game and play it more  we continued to play together in that format with a few other players a mix of vets and new players hopping in and agreed that aslong as the number of vets were small it was still a fun and balanced game.   RECOMMENDATION: I whole hartedly suggest if you have the money/friends to play this game fps player or not that you get it as a 4-pack and play it as a group in bot games until you feel comfortable with your skills than slowly start joining more and more populated servers.  I DO NOT recommend playing this game ALONE (if you are new to NS/Twitch shooters like quake) you WILL be bad when you start playing and it can be draining to play with out friends to goof off with.",

Although a lot of people are annoyed it's not a free update, I got my beta key for free so I can't really complain about that aspect. If you enjoyed combat in the original Natural Selection or just like the idea of playing Aliens vs. Marines but can't be bothered with all the building and structure maintenance that comes with playing Natural Selection 2. You'll most likely enjoy Combat simply because there's only 1 objective, kill the enemy and level up. Unless of course you're looking for a CTF style of gameplay, which this game also offers. I can't really say anything bad about NS2: Combat, the developers are friendly hard working people dedicated to producing a top notch product and the 76 hour stream/Q&amp;A showed just that. I'm still amazed I won a key.",

Paying for this one does feel negative, but the game has played well for me and I have enjoyed it.  I am still getting my feet... claws? under me again but even with getting completely destroyed a few times, I am enjoying it. I get acknowledged for assisting which for someone who plays gorge/lerk, this is really good. That said, it does feel a little off late game, but I am content to wait and see how things go because I am having fun.  Personally, I would recommend this over NS2 normal to friends who like online shooters. In that sense, the game is just right, I do wish they would have given those who owned NS2 a discount like most other people, but you know what, it is fun enough for the price I have paid. I definitely doesnt feel anywhere near as much of a rip off as Borderland Pre Sequel.",
