            "review_text": "First: Want to say 'thank you' to the fine people at BlueLines for responding quickly to fix bug in this game. Found the person I talked with polite and friendly and taking my concerns seriously. (I believe it took them less than a week to fix the problem.) Good job!  Second: This game is very simple... and EXTREMELY difficult. Each game takes about 5-10 minutes to play so is good for entertaining yourself when have a little break. I pride myself on being very good with turn-based boardgames but this simulator had me gnashing my teeth a few times. ;P  It a very simple game to learn... I gifted an extra copy to a friend and we were challenging each other within 5 minutes of install... but challenging the computer at 'Hardest Level' is QUITE another matter. You may think you winning but the board can change quickly!  To be honest... I can think ahead about 5-6 moves in chess. But this game has so fewer variables for the computer to keep track of (in terms of possible moves) that the computer can think ahead maybe 10-12 moves on the more difficult settings.  My recomendation? Begin at the easiest level and then increase difficulty as you improve your skill.  BUT BE PREPARED TO BE HUMBLED! *Giggle*  Personal note: If someone has beaten this on the Hardest difficulty I would *LOVE* to see some sort of guide or strategy-hints. :D   ",
