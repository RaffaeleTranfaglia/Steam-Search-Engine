For the asking price, it's a steal. A LOT of meta humor in there. All Monkey Island fans should own this game :)  ",

Pros: the gameplay is easy to get into, the dialogue is fun, and the mechanics are solid (for the most part)  Cons: the music and sound choices are odd at best and annoying at worst, the game requires a lot in-game waiting to progress, the controls are finicky, and the game has crashed on me three times in nine hours of total play  If the devs fixed the crash issue and it didn't require so much waiting for supplies to fill, I'd like it a lot more.",

            "review_text": "The concept is quite interesting, and I'm sure it would be extremely fun to trudge through the story.  However the UI needs a lot of work, you have to mouse-click everything, with the number of fights you encounter, this makes the game pretty exhausting to play.  If auto-battle were in the game (or extremely fast battle speed), it would make the game a lot more fun to play.",

Unfortunately the menus and buttons are all over the place, forcing you to move across your mouse across the entire screen. Even confirming attacks requires quite a bit of mouse movement. Also there aren't any sound effects for the buttons. While the ui's buttons do work on mouse-up.. they don't have a pressed state. ",
