            "review_text": "0.) Warning! This review mentions several things that may or may not be spoilers. The game is randomized to a degree and also depends greatly on your own choices in-game. There is no right or wrong way to play, but I do mention several things that I consider to be entertaining examples of ADOM's charm. Everything below is optional and nothing below is related to the 'main plot' but if the threat of spoilers gives you heart palpitations, just know that I heartily endorse ADOM (whether in ASCII or in the new graphical mode). It's one of my top 10 games of all-time, and I gladly supported it during its indiegogo campaign despite there still being a completely free version available from the developer. It's just that good.  1.) This game has entertained me for well over a decade, and I'm still not tired of it.  2.) Every time you start a new character, make a note of what your first kill is; trust me.  3.) Don't kick a door head-on if you can help it; diagonals are best.  4.) Killing cats is bad.  5.) If you find yourself with a cursed item, you might want to try stripping naked and standing in an acid trap for a few minutes.  6.) Don't touch strange trees you find underground.  7.) Never sell or drop your last Si.  8.) If at first you don't succeed, try playing a hurthling archer.  9.) There is a dedicated hotkey for wiping your face, and you'll need it.  10.) After 1000+ hours, I have never managed to reach even one of the possible endings; the furthest I've reached is character level 43 and it was glorious.",

            "review_text": "ADOM is the definitive rogue-like experience. If you're a fan of rogue-likes, you've probably played ADOM already. However, this is the first of the classic rogue-likes to make its way into Steam and a wide new audience. People who are interested in rogue-like themes and the so called rogue-lite games might find a lot to like here.  As a rogue-like, ADOM is a turn-based RPG. This means that every time you take an action, all of the other characters in the game do so as well, including enemies. In a sense, it's not really turn-based as all the movement happens at once, meaning you never have to wait for the enemy's movement. Combat is a simple matter at ground level but gets more complex as the game progresses. In its most basic form, you are simply 'running' into enemies. This causes you to attack them and they will attack back at you and so on. However, you can influence this combat in many ways. This includes switching your tactics to gain better to-hit chance and damage at the expense of defenses (can be used flexibly and in different ways depending on the situation), casting spells, drinking potions, zapping wands, reading scrolls, firing missiles, using skills and maneuvering around the dungeon to name a few. Trash mobs you can simply run into and destroy with ease, but whenever you encounter a new and unknown, potentially strong monster, you might want to slow down the pace and consider what gear you have to help you. And remember the number one rule of rogue-likes: always have an escape plan in mind!  ADOM is absolutely brutal. Rogue-lite games often mention how they are extremely difficult and will require multiple tries before you beat them. These games also tend to be relatively short, 1-2 hour experiences in various genres from fps to platformers. ADOM on the other hand is a purebred rogue-like through and through; a successful game is likely to take 15+ hours and the hundreds of failures you will suffer on the way will add even more hours on top of that. Now I happen to think this is a strength; there is immense amounts of replayability in the game due to a variety of races and classes you can play as, in addition to a huge amount of procedural generation when it comes to monsters you encounter, loot you find and dungeon layouts you will explore. And once you beat the game normally, guess what! There's several Ultra Endings to attempt as well! These endings are insanely hard to pull off, require EVEN more tries than the normal one and are virtually impossible without some outside information sources.  ADOM's strength in relation to other rogue-likes lies in its structured nature: Terinyo is always in the same place as well as the main dungeons of the game. There are quests that you will undertake in a logical order and once you learn your way around the early game, it is possible to form a strategy. This is absolutely key; where many rogue-likes hinge purely on RNG to get you going, ADOM actually has a very deep strategy layer to its gameplay. The other notable selling point in relation to other rogue-likes is the skill system; every race and class has a set of skills they start off with, and these skills can be improved as you advance in levels. This gives leveling a more meaningful feeling compared to some other rogue-likes where you simply gain more health and magic points.  Now this review could go on forever, but hopefully I've given you some insight into whether or not ADOM is something you might be into. Personally, I love this game. I have beaten it three times the normal way and once I've achieved the Avatar of Order ending. I've played this game over the course of 15 years, two development cycles and who knows how many hours. It is truly something special.  Lastly, some meta-advice:  -Do not play the game in softcore mode! Permadeath is an integral part of the rogue-like experience and you will hate ADOM if you don't have permadeath on. A character is very likely to die; you have to learn to deal with it. The entire premise of the game is that you roll hundreds of characters until finally one of them sticks and gets farther into the game than the others. If you keep struggling with a character who was never even meant to survive the experience will be miserable. Not to mention you will never have that feeling of utter disaster when your best character dies at the final level. Or on the way back after winning the game. And all of those losses will build up to the final success; when you finally, after all that heartbreak, beat the game and leave Drakalor Chain, you look back at the time you've spent and go: '♥♥♥♥ yes, I actually did it. I beat this son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game. Hell yes.'  -Don't be afraid to look up stuff on the wiki: ADOM is a massive game and very cryptic in some areas. However, I would suggest avoiding making a habit out of this. Explore the game freely; you're going to die so many times anyway so what's the point of completely spoiling yourself? But once you get a promising character rolling, you might want to check up on the effects of eating this specific monster's corpse, or how dangerous exactly that Gorgon is ;)  -Give the ASCII version a try! The tilesets are very nicely done and the bare-bones ASCII style might seem clunky and unintuitive at first. But you'd be surprised at the advantages it has. For example, you will easily identify new enemies: a small 'g' is always going to be a goblin-like small humanoid, an uppercase 'D' is always going to be a dragon or dragon-like huge lizard like drake and so on. Very clear and handy compared to the tilesets imo. Not to mention the ASCII graphics are just so damn charming!  -vesmo",

            "review_text": "I learned the basics of this game about 1,5 years ago and have since then been playing it fairly regularly. Haven't managed to finish one yet, but the great thing about this game is that it doesn't really matter that much. It's not about winning. It's about your character, that you'll be scared for, that you'll pray for, that you'll coddle up and train. You'll be angry at fate, god or just the rng, you'll laugh at stupid deaths, you'll get surges of adrenaline at the sight of that out-of-depth monster around the corner and be immensely relieved when you make it to the next staircase without being followed. Pride when you get out of a situation that looked completely desperate by using your wits, disbelief when you finally identify your stuff and see that you've been carrying around 2 (!!) amulets of life saving, anger at yourself when you lose that really promising character just because you didn't stop playing in time (when you noticed your eyes started itching and your vision got a bit blurry, but hey, you just couldn't leave the game at that point, no way...) I'm really no game expert, I don't have any comparison to other roguelikes or any other computer games for that matter. But what I love about ADOM is that it's creating stories. Of course there is the ingame storyline, but it's also creating stories in your mind. Even in plain ascii mode, maybe especially there. Your heartrate goes up at the sight of a yellow &amp; and you start hating the sight of any kind of f. You just have to admire (and love) the simplicity of that! I'll admit that it takes some time to get into it and figure out all the commands, but that's only a small price to pay for everything this game has to offer!",

This game is eight years older than me, and is still being updated constantly... that speaks volumes about the dedication the creator has.  The resurrection campaign's success a few years ago spoke immeasuably about the amazing community the game has developed.

            "review_text": "I will start with the con (just one) in this game: The learning curve / keybindings are tough on this. You need to be patient and learn/ list lots of commands on the keyboard.   I first played ADOM around 2003-2004. We had a crappy computer which couldn't handle many games at all, but my brother had ADOM on it. I tested it and was instantly hooked: So much to explore, so hard! Only one life? The merciless roguelike system where the game is permanently over when you die made me curious.  The added graphics are quite nice addition to the game and I imagine it's easier for new players to get into the game. I use only the keyboard controls for the game, as it is much faster (and I've played it for years so it comes natural). I recommend tackling the keyboard commands if you want faster gameplay.  There are so many ways you can be good (or bad) at this game. The game has been around for decades so it is well-balanced, but also still very challenging. I haven't still finished this game without 'cheating', that is what was known as save scumming, where you copy the save file in case you die and continue game from there. I died just once to a stupid mistake which I don't remember anymore, but it still annoys me, even after multiple years. I'm fully determined to finish ADOM in the near future... In a nutshell, the reasons I enjoy playing ADOM: - Challenging enough - Addictive - you'll probably end up screaming like a maniac for dying, swear you had enough ADOM for a week, only to find yourself trying a new character 10 minutes later - Variable - Dozens, if not hundreds of ways to play the game (race, class combinations + different endings, quests to pursue, places to visit) - Unpredictable - You might get mighty lucky early in the game, or really unlucky (dying to a random stone block trap early on for example), or both at the same, or neither. Just like life! - Bang for your buck - If you end up liking this game, you will probably enjoy it for years - I estimate that I have played more than 1000 hours pre-steam  If you decide to buy the game: Don't totally spoil yourself reading guides beforehand - just go to places, explore them and read late-game guides only if you get stuck to some place. Trust me, you will enjoy the exploration more on your own.",

To be sure, there are a lot of commands for ADOM. However, all of those commands give you a great deal of control over the game. They do take some time to learn, but fortunantly the keybinding help is a quick ? away, and after a couple times of looking the command up, it's easy to remember.  ADOM is a great game, and exremely challenging. Don't let the large number of commands (many of which you won't use very often anyways) scare you away.",

            "review_text": "This is my absolute favourite rogue like. I have been playing for at least 10 years and the new steam version adds some welcome changes.  I love this game simply because it has all the awsome features you would expect from a roguelike but with a world map. The world map is always the same and features a lot of entrances to dungeons and villages, each being different in sometimes a variety of ways, and for the most part are randomized every game. this leaves you free to pick and choose which quests you want to take. Once you have figured out a lot of the early quests you can choose to skip the ones in which the rewards do not interest you.  My one criticism of this game is that the religion system sucks. It's not interesting, the rewards for becoming uber pious are kind of lackluster when i consider how grindy and unenjoyable reaching that point is. Fortunately it is not necesary to concern yourself with it. I compare this game in this regard to dungeon crawl and IVAN which both have interesting and fun religion systems.  Another aspect of this game that i like compared to other roguelikes, such as dungeon crawl, is that the skill system is very rewarding. some skills are passive and just buff your character but others have specific applications. you can pick pockets, pick locks, build bridges, craft arrows, tame animals, brew potions, smith armour... For me this adds a layer of character that helps me role play.  I recomend this game however if you do not have any experience with roguelikes i suggest you do some reading about the genre as this game is brutal and, other than the games basic mechanics, this is mostly a trial by fire.  I am adamant about not using guides or cheating, however this game is so brutal that despite knowing all i need to know i have never managed to win even a single time despite using the adom guidebook and perusing forums for additional insight.",

A nice selection of classes, races (not the car or horse kind), a birth sign system and randomly generated dungeons combine into a time sucking gem.

There is mouse integration, although as to its merits I currently don't know as I tend to use the built in keyboard shortcuts to play.

Now I have to explain that I'm one of those people who were playing ADOM since early-days. I spent countless hours and spent dozens on dozens of characters to their eventual deaths. And that is something you have to get used to in this game. Your characters die. When they die, they're gone for good. Shiny gear. Nifty abilities. Everything. Gone. The only thing you'll have to remember them by is their entry on your personal high score board reminding you that your best character died on level 5 of some hole in the field because he/she died of the black plague because you ate a kobold corpse on the ground.   I'm resisting the urge to ramble on and on here. ADOM really is a good game! Its wonderfully complex yet simple in its premise. There is no real story involved. 'Go and fight Chaos'. They drop you on the world and wish you good luck. The overworld is always the same. And the dungeons you dive into are always random. But this time, instead of the ASCII characters representing yourself, enemies, and items on the ground, you have a nifty little graphical representation. And in the 'old' game, you had to memorize a LOT of hotkeys, as combinations of letters with alt/shift/ctrl were what you had to press to perform actions and bring up menus.   But that's the rub. The GUI (that's Graphical User Inferface), in my opinion, is about 75% of what you're buying here. Yes, there are a few different modes you can play in. Yes, you can now play by using the mouse and right-clicking to bring up a menu of things you can do instead of remembering its keystroke to make it more forgiving for newbies learning how to get around - though the game itself can still be brutal. But when you get down to brass tacks, you're buying cosmetics.   That's why I wavered on the tumbs up and tumbs down. I love ADOM. It's a relic from junior high through college for me. But are you willing to drop more than $10 for what adds up to little more than polish? I did, for the nostaliga. But it might be a touch stiff for others when they could have gotten the original ADOM for free in the past.",

Finally jumped in the pond and swam around slowly dying while more and more tutorial messages continued to display. Eventually drowned. Quit game. Wrote review.  10/10 Would die in tutorial confused, cursed, and alone again.",

            "review_text": "As of the latest beta, R71 in October 2016, I re-purchased this game and have played it a few hours. While I have only played it on an 11' MacBook Air so far, I can say that all my complaints about the previous version have been addressed. The game looks good and operates properly as soon as you run it. It has a steap learning curve, but that's not entirely unexpected in this sort of game. The tile graphics are reasonably nice.  Original Review, December 2015:  This was the first ever Steam game I returned; it's that bad, at least on my Mac. First, basic computer program sequences didn't work. For example, I couldn't figure out how to quit out of the game and the standard Command-Q and menu items did nothing. I eventually pulled up the 'Force Quit' menu and killed the program that way (equivalent to kill -9 for Unix users). Second, the fonts and window don't scale properly, and there are about 37,000 settings for these things, none of which produce a nice, usable look and feel on fonts unless you leave the window a tiny thing on the screen. On a 2560x1440 or 1920x1080 screen it is just insanely silly. Third, the tutorial is more annoying than helpful. It randomly pops up a super-small text box that is ridiculously difficult to scroll through telling you things that are generally irrelevant at the time. Sure, it's a roguelike and so there are tons of commands, but at least list them for me in some sort of importance order on the side of the screen or something.  All in all, I've been playing Roguelikes since, literally, Rogue in the 80s and this was one of the worst experiences ever. I returned the program to Steam and downloaded the free one. I've spent a few hours with the free one and found no way around any of these problems above. If you want a truly great Roguelike to buy here on Steam, look at ToME instead. It's cheaper, easier to learn, much more beautiful, and 'just works.'",

Take my word if you spend the time to learn how to fully play this game it will be something you play off and on for the rest of your *unnatural life..

Every time I roll a new character I am faced with new challenges, and learn new things through the errors I make. The learning curve is extremely steep, and the game is dreadful to start with, but once you get the hang of it, it will keep on challenging you. Plus, you can strangle steel golems with your bare hands. That counts for something right?",

            "review_text": "ADOM (Ancient Domains of Mystery) is a roguelike adventure game, developed by a team of 5 people. This review is coming from someone who has not played the original games in the series and has no prior knowledge, and from someone who didn’t grow up playing this type of game either. Please bear that in mind with this review.   Gameplay is like any other roguelike game, where you get to choose from an array of different characters, and develop levels, statistics and skills as you progress. The game is played from a top down angel and is very heavily weighted towards stats and what choices you make in whether you succeed or fail. The game’s tutorial absolutely bombards you with way too much information which personally left more confused compared to when I first started. The controls and UI are quite possibly the worst I have ever experienced in a game too. There is quite literally a different button for every single mechanic in the game. This game made me feel sufficiently stupid because of how much jumble there is on any one screen at any time. The game was telling me to use buttons that I don’t think I have ever used on this keyboard. I am surprised this is one of the most popular roguelikes ever just from going off the usability of the game thus far.   The graphics are bad, there is no way around it and anyone who says otherwise is purely saying it from a nostalgia standpoint. The pictures in the screen shots are definitely not what the game looks like on my screen, and I was playing the game in 4k.   I am still stuck in the tutorial of the game, because of being dumbfounded with the controls and the amount of information being thrown at me but this game if you manage to get into it, will offer you hours and hours of content with a very high replay ability factor also being the main reason behind this.   I am fully expecting this review to not be very popular given that I have reviewed it before even getting out of the tutorial; and I am clearly missing something about this game since it is so highly rated. But for me, having not grown up playing this type of game, and from someone who is not able to take in abundant amounts of information and learning the most whacky confusing control scheme, I simply cannot recommend it. It is possibly a generation thing, but if you mostly agree with my reviews and enjoy the same games I do, then you may want to eerie on the side of caution when trying this out as it is simply a game I did not enjoy at all.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away   2) Not Recommended   3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play ---- If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

If you do investigate, however, you will probably find yourself diving into an abyss of such depth which you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  I'll just leave this here as a warning to newbies, and hope to update it in a year or so! ",
