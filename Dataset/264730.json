            "review_text": "When I saw the trailer for this game on Gonzo's youtube channel a good year or two ago I thought to myself 'Huh, this game looks pretty cool' and just left it at that. Two years later Deadly 30 popped up on Steam and I thought why not?  The first thing you will notice when you start up the game is the art style. It's definitely Gonzo's style and it's done really well. The game combines cartoony graphics with with less than child-friendly themes and creates a nice atmosphere.  Onto the music, the music is done well and serves its purpose well but isn't memorable. There isn't a theme you'll be humming to yourself later and for a game like this, maybe that's not really nessesary.  Now the gameplay. When you start a new game you're put into a hostile side-scrolling world with only your gun to help you. As you travel you find an empty bunker and decide to call it home. After the game teaches you the basic controls the zombies start spawning. The zombies are divided into three colours: Green (being the weakest), Blue and Red (being the strongest), along with other more interesting zombies.  After surviving the first night you explore either left or right and start to salvage scrap metal, the currency of the game, and have a chance of finding other survivors. The other survivors consist of a Russian marksman and a trenchgun-wielding German. After forming this unlikely alliance you a challenged to survive thirty days and thirty nights untill you are rescued.  Now this is easier said than done, the game is hard and on your first attempt you will die, there's just no way around it. However, when you start a new game your level is kept the same and anything you unlocked in the previous save will be available for purchase via the shop found in the bunker. You will definitely want to get to your bunker before nightfall. Nightfall is when the zombies are at both their fastest and deadliest. Buying and upgrading defenses is critical to your survival. You buy things like weapons and defenses through the ingame shop found inside your bunker.  The shooting and moving in this game feel very arcadey, which isn't nessesarily a bad thing. The movement is nice and the shooting feels satisfying. You move your character around with the WASD keys or the arrow keys and shoot by aiming with your Mouse and firing with Mouse 1.  Now I mentioned before there were two other characters, the Russian and the German. While their character art is done really well the voice acting does tend to create some cringe-worthy moments. I could tell that Gonzo and Iggy did the voices themself (with some help for the German). The Russian talks in a deep voice which wasn't convincing at all and the German's voice is very quiet and has some mic distortion at times. While the voices are a bit off it doesn't subtract from the gameplay.  Steam's asking me if I recommend this game; for $5 there are certainly worse things to spend your money on. This game is fun arcadey shooting action with open-world exploration and base-fortifying holdouts and, to be honest, is the most fun I've had with a zombie game in quite a while. One thing I would recommend would be a multiplayer option. I was gutted when I didn't find any multiplayer within the game. I know it would take a bit of coding and a bit of time but I think it would be well worth it in the end. Other than that, this game is one of the better indie titles I've played. Definitely recommended",

There is nice variety between the gun types, and a new zombie type every night keeps it fresh.   It could use a few tooltips (for example, I dunno the difference between armor and the armor upgrade, just that the upgrade is better, and I have no idea what the 'Boots' do) and maybe a small RPG skill-tree type thing.  Lastly, (As of Night 10 at least) the world is small. 5 'Scroll Left or Right' stages, completely linear. Maybe a more rugged and varied terrain would help with the linearity.   All those aside, the game is easily worth its price if you want a fun grind-fest type shoot-em-up game.",

            "review_text": "This is quite a fun side-scrolling shooter set in a WW2 alternate reality where zombies now roam the land. Its essentially a flash-game at heart which unfortuntely means there is a terrible problem with lag if you play at too high a resolution or dont set the graphics display to its lowest. Unless you're fortunate to have a powerful rig.   That aside however the minimal amount of gameplay mechanics make the game simplistic in nature but quite rewarding if you persevere through the ever increasing levels of difficulty. There are 30 in total (obviously) but unfortunately the second issue with the game is that there is no savegame facility, other than to autosave the last level until you quit the game. Then you will have to start over again. (Remember it is a flash game)  Despite these the game does have some redeeming features; a party of three different soldiers to control as a group. Each able to level-up in ability (no skills/perks though), each uses a particular weapon (assault rifle, rifle and shotgun) which can be upgraded as you progress.  In addition core gameplay revolves around upgrading and defending your base from night attacks and going out during the day to pick up the games currency (metal objects) with which you can buy upgrades for your base (fences, obstacles, turrets) and upgrades for your personnel (weapons, armor, boots, ammo and first aid kits). There are two areas to search, to the east and to the west of the base. Each has two further areas which are restocked every level with items to smash &amp; shoot to get more ammo and currency.  The challenge is obviously beating the zombie threats during each level and collecting enough currency to upgrade your base and party to help you achieve your goal. So if you think youll enjoy playing a game with this sort of basic mechanic then you should consider this.  Overall I found it fun to play in the odd spare moment I had. But dont expect to finish the game in a few playthroughs. Its tough and unforgiving towards the harder levels. However for the price of a £1/$1/1euro you cant really go wrong.  - Just be warned about the lagging issue. Make sure you read up on the main thread in the game's forum before buying or you may not be able to play this game as you progress through the 30 levels.",

            "review_text": "So, I swear I've played this game before on popular flash websites such as New grounds, but I could be wrong and may have played something very similar to it. The idea is simple. You start off as one character who makes his way to an abandoned outpost in the dead of night. Having activated the power generator, you are now in charge of protecting the generator for a full 30 nights. You have two entrances that you need to cover, using fences and the like, and the horde of zombies one their way to your location grow stronger every passing night. Ammo, medkits that heal your entire party when consumed, armor, and new guns can be purchased while your in combat, pausing the game as well. After completing each night, you will praise the sun, repair damage to your fence, and head outside to scavenge for more scrap pieces, ammo, and kill more zombies. Leveling up your character will give you access to new weapons and equipment, such as a turret. Remember a bit ago when I mentioned medkits healing your entire party? That's right, you aren't alone in this, so to speak. There is no multiplayer or co-op, but you can search across the wilderness to find friendly AI-controller partners to help you fight off the undead. You can switch back and forth to control each of the different partners, and your AI-controlled pals will attempt to fight off the horde with you while the zombies make their way into your house. Death doesn't quite need to mean The End though, as your progress is saved each night that you survive to allow you to try things differently should things not work out for you.  Gonzossm has a very unique art style he uses with all of his animations and it's very easy to spot his work at a glance. If you've enjoyed his previous games on New grounds or his flash videos there or on YouTube, then this may already be in your shopping cart. It's a great game, at a price I can't argue with. Even if you end up deciding that you don't like the game after playing for a few hours, it's unlikely that you'll regret the $4.00 you spent.  I don't typically put a space betwen New and Grounds, but for some reason, Steam has a filter that turns it into hearts.",

This game isn't really original, and nothing else makes up for that. This game really lacks in a lot of ways, and there aren't a lot of pros. If you want to judge it yourself, here is a pros and cons list.  Pros: - You more or less know what you're getting into, so it's not something you'll have to learn how to play. - Characters are decently interesting, and balance is interesting too. - Good choice of weapons, building, turrets, armor, and boots which have some fun progression. - A way to support Gonzo if you like his videos (I don't really, but it'd be nice to just look at this if you like him). - Pretty artwork to look at (this isn't important).  Cons: - Really, really, unoriginal gameplay. It can be incredibly boring if you're used to these games, especially since the game gets unbelievably hard towards the end since turrets can be destroyed and they're very expensive. - Voice acting is hilariously bad, it sounds like one guy voiced it (and there is a girl character in the game). - While there are a bunch of weapons, there is really one line of progression for each character and no balance between weapons.  Overall, this game is ok but is nothing, more, just a decent game. There are actually better games on Kongregate than something like this, and a game feeling like a bad flash game is a horrible thing. There isn't any reason to buy an ok game so you really shouldn't buy this when there are many other games that are much more fun.",

And I'm kind of sad to say that because the two guys at the head of developing this are really great animators, and have made really sweet flash games before... but this isn't really one of them. It lacks story, music, any kind of interesting upgrade system, a meaningful scavenge system, customizable base, etc. Anything that would have made it more than just a bland sidescrolling zombie survival, and made it into a memorable and fantastic one. The closer for me was probably how buggy it is. Like, my aim would constantly spaz out, or I couldn't properly alt-tab, or that I'd hit fullscreen and the screen wouldn't fit right (and I know what my resolution is). At least the visuals and bits of humor I did get were well done. Pass. 5/10.",

Setting its processing priority to as high as possible while lowering the asset quality helped me immensly, so I can't complain about that too much. The game scales well in difficulty, the exception arguably being the end. While unpolished with unhelpful menus and some annoying characters, I thought it was worth the few hours that I spend playing it, which is good enough for me at the very least.",

            "review_text": "You're given a Base with two fences in the middle of four areas to scavenge through and you start as the american soldier with a machine gun. During the day you pick a direction to go in and find random amounts of scrap to buy upgrades and supplies(ammo, medkits). As you scavenge you have a chance to run into two other characters who are placed randomly, the german with a shotgun and a stronger melee, and the russian with a rifle that pierces multiple enemies. When you kill zombies you get experience towards leveling up which opens up more upgrades to buy. There's a level cap of 13 which I hit at around night 18 or 19 and there's a few unlocks that seem to be purely asthetic. Running out of levels to unlock changes killing zombies from fun to more of a chore.  At night your (and possibly you're two other) character has to hold back an increasingly strong wave of zombies. You have to save your scrap as much as you can in order to purchase expensive turrets and fence upgrades or by the time you hit night 30 you will just get steamrolled no matter if you've maxed out your characters upgrades. Each character has four guns to upgrade to but the even the best guns feel impotent towards the last five nights.  Lastly the voice acting makes me wish I could turn the volume of the dialogue down to zero. The german is a grating female nazi stereotype, and Russian is a painful Yakof shmirnoff impression, and the American is the usual gruff patriot constantly saying that he loves america.  Potentially worth several hours of fun, but if you try to play it in anything but windowed mode it will constantly suffer from horrible slowdown. every time you start to enjoy yourself everything slows down to almost stand-still and your character starts acting on his own, sometimes causing unavoidable cheap deaths. So you have the option of playing in eye strain vision, or in full screen slug motion. Pretty generic, you could find something equally entertaining on kongregate for free.",

Let it be said that this game is not polished in the slightest. That being said; this game has it's own distinct charm, albeit obfuscated by rather sophmoric humor.   Where the game really shines is in the gameplay. It has some interesting ideas on gathering supplies by day and mounting a defense by night; two elements that are intertwined together pretty nicely.  The graphics are a bit hit or miss. They are colorful and quirky, and are at least fun to look at. My quips tend to derive from some of the exaggerated upgrades; the game themes itself as a WWII zombie survival game, yet incorporates nerd elements like Samus Aran's armor and Saiyan armor amongst the upgrades; which admittedly is somewhat cool yet also clashes with the theme more than I'd prefer anyway. I'm not even a history buff really; it just seems somewhat out of place.  For the feel of the game; it feels like a very well crafted flash game at the end of the day. I've played a few other zombie survival 2d shooting games and have had relatively the same amount of fun there than I'm having here with Deadly 30. It can be guilty of repetion to some extent; the grinding for salvage probably being the main contributor to such fatigue, yet at the same time I can't not recommend it. It's a pretty good game for what it is; just be sure to pick it up in a sale. Fatigued as I am of zombie games in general this game turned out to be a pleasant surprise; if you can look past the poop jokes (there will be poop jokes).",

The only thing that changes with the levels are the zombies(easy enough to guess). Once the game is beaten, it has little replace value. The only thing left for you is to grind through achievements (which can be completed in 1 play through) Although more of a minor criticism, it's also disappointing that WWII weapons and concepts were mixed with modern weaponry.

            "review_text": "Warning: I played this game mostly in offline mode, so my playtime stat is not accuratelly reflected on Steam. I did play it from start to finish (the full 30 days).  Deadly 30 is a very simple and straightforward 2D survival game. You are tasked with surviving 30 days in a zombie infested area. The game has 2 distinct phases. The first one is the exploration phase that happens during the day. During this time, you are encouraged to leave your base and scavenge for the in-game currency called 'scraps' that are found either on the ground pretty much everywhere, by disassembling vehicles you find in the wilderness to turn them into scraps / shooting boxes filled with scraps and ammo or as drops you get from killing zombies. In this phase, you will not meet many zombies, and they will attack you mostly, if not only, from the front.  During the night, however, your vision is restricted, and you can only see the direction you point your flashlight and gun at. The zombie horde also attacks more fiercely and from both sides indiscriminately, so the game encourages you to seek shelter in your base. Also, if the night falls and you are in one of the wilderness areas, you cannot change locations until dawn.  The scraps you collect can be used in your HQ to purchase defenses for your base that range from boxes to fences and, later on, turrets, to armor and gun upgrades. You can also purchase more ammo for your guns and medkits. The base itself is just a very small 2 store building with a generator in the middle.   You start the game with a single survivor, but you can find 2 more placed in one of the 4 different areas you can explore - a mountain area, a cornfield, a snow field and a castle. Each survivor uses only one gun type - the american soldier wields machine guns or assault rifles, the russian soldier uses rifles (and later on ,something more bizarre) and the german soldier (who happens to be a woman) carries a shotgun. I have the suspicion they both always appear at the same area, but I can't confirm it. You can instantly switch between each of your survivors, and the other 2 you are not currently controlling will default to AI bots. The AI is decent enough for this game, and will fall back if you do and assume high ground positions in your HQ to cover each side. It works.  One of my main gripes with the game is how little is explained to the player about the system mechanics. An example is the combat boots upgrade. There is no tooltip or any information whatsoever about what it does. I presume it makes you faster, but I didn't notice any difference with the first upgrade, and by the time I got the second one, I was conditioned to walk using short hops instead of walking anyway. I also had no idea the little boxes you find everywhere where supposed to be shot. I thought using the action key (E) would open them, but nothing happened when I tried. I started thinking that was a marking spot for camps made by the other 2 survivors, and finally just imagined it was a background item. Only when the NPC survivor shot it and I saw it taking damage did I realize it could be looted by destroying it. There are some other little things that the game could tell you to make your life easier - like showing you can fix your fence / dismantle vehicles as it is being attacked while simultaneously shooting at the assailants, or explaining the function of the generator, as I have yet to understand what it does, and never saw any zombies attacking it even when they breached my defenses. Is it powering the guns? I have no idea. Do I get a game over if they destroy it? They seem more interested in attacking my survivors than the generator. This is especially confusing since you get a message saying 'Protect your generator' when the nightfalls and you are outside of the base, but even staying outside the full night will not compromise it. Oh, and the game could have told you that resting in the bed to make the night come faster also proportionally recovers your health. Granted, this is sort of videogame common sense, but this is a simple game not intended for a hardcore audience, so a little tooltip or something would be appreciated.  There isn't a lot of enemy variety. Off the top of my head, there are 3 basic melee zombies with varying colors that only change their walk speed, 2 giant types of zombies that only change their durability and strenght, 2 fat 'boomer' type of zombies that explode when killed and spreads a sticky liquid upon death that hinders your vision and seems to entice the horde to attack you (from both sides), a skeleton zombie, 2 types of dog zombies and bird zombies. It is, however, a short game, and as such, the low variety can be forgiven. At the start of the game, you will only see the basic melee zombie, but as you progress, others will start appearing, with certain nights having a theme with a certain enemy type being proeminent amongst the attacking horde.  The wilderness areas are also extremely repetitive. All that changes between them is that they sport a different floor and a different background each. They are functionally identical, and the exact same things spawn in all of them. There is no exploration to be done here beyond collecting the game currency. Once you realize that, you might even forsake going to the farther areas and, instead, just stay in a single wilderness area sweeping it clean and reloading the area by going to a different one, as this will cause new scrap / vehicle / box spawns to appear. Perhaps this can be abused to find the survivors very early, but I didn't try.  The game is also very, very easy, as long as you dont waste scrap with inane things like boxes. Just focus on finding a survivor as soon as possible, take advantage of the lower enemy rate in the first few days to explore a lot and stay outside exploring if needed, upgrade the fence to T2 as soon as you can and upgrade your weapons to T3, and get the sentry gun as soon as you can afford. After that, work on getting those T4 weapons, starting with the russian guy, who has the best T4 weapon of them all. The last day can be a little hard if you lack enough sentries or enough fence upgrades to stop the horde, and since the game overwrites the last save with the current day save, you could mess up your chance at completing the game if you reach day 29 with insufficient resources and a bad upgrade path. But don't worry - as long as you explore during all 30 days, you will have plenty to get all weapons to T4, your fence to T4, your full armor and some sentries. You can live without the boots if you double tap the forward button constantly to do short hops, but the boots might help marginally even while doing that. Still, I'd suggest delaying the boots and the armor upgrade, and dont waste money buying bullets for the russian and german soldiers, as you will get plenty of both from exploring alone.  Overall, this game feels like a polished flash game, with graphics that resemble some of the nicer Newsground flash games, and the lack of depth and longevity that comes with them. The lack of an endless mode further exacerbates the longevity problem, qualifying this game as no more than a half decent time waster. The lack of controller support is another demerit to the title. If you really wanna buy this game, I'd say wait for at least a 50% off promotional offer, as the current price is not justified by its content, even though it is already cheap at its full price.",
