This is the old school Sierra type where you are given few to no pointers. Great games, but poor port job. It is just a quick DosBox fix. If I wanted that I could have just Dosboxed my old diskette copies myself. Because of the shoddy job the game will regularly crash. I had it crash 4 times in 20 minutes. Not cool Sierra. I would recommend if not for the crashes.",
