            "review_text": " This is a long review, so if you just want a summary of why I recommend Dawn of War Gold Edition then skip to the  Results  section and reading from there.   Relic Entertainment works with Games Workshop to produce an epic real time strategy game that pushed the boundaries of the genre. Dawn of War offers economics, base building, military tactics, and unit management.    Story:  Dawn of War, the first installment on an incredible Warhammer 40,000 saga. The game is based on the planet Tarturus where Ork forces are out of control ravaging the planet and destroying Imperial Guard moral; but, how are they winning so easily? Of course the forces of Chaos are behind the whole war. Dawn of War is the story of Gabrial Angelos and Isador Akios and how they work together to figure out the whole reason behind the presence of Chaos on the imperial garrison at Tarturus.    Campaign:  The campaign offers an epic tale into the 40k lore with amazing twists and turns around every mission. Coupled with the amazing combat system, base management, and resource management this game really packs a punch. The campaign is divided into eleven missions which put you to the test fighting against the Orc Horde and the Chaos Might. As you progress through the campaign you work with the Eldar to defeat a common foe, but as the game dictates the Enemy of your Enemy is not always your friend. The game pits teams together, but at the same time continually draws them apart.    Gameplay:  This game was one of the first to successfully introduce rapid base expansion by requiring players to capture strategic points, which give the player a trickle of endless resources over time. The fast paced gameplay coupled with the macro and micro unit management really made this game a force to be reckoned with. Although the unit population seems rather low (20 personal – 10 vehicle) because the units are based in squads the real unit count is much higher. The battles seem more like full scale wars with you gripping to manage all your units at once. The best feature of this game (and all the Dawn of War games) is that each team is completely different. They have different units, different buildings, upgrades, tactics, resource types, hero units, and strategies. For example the Orc play completely different from the Eldar while both the Eldar and Orcs play completely different from the Space Marines and Chaos Marines. The only two similar teams are the Space Marines and Chaos marines which offer a good learners curve to Dawn of War by giving providing a basic approach to strategy: build barracks, build turrets for defense, use main base to upgrade to new “age” to receive better buildings, build power plants to get power, and upgrade units within armory, etc.    Teams:  There are four teams: Space Marines, Eldar, Orcs, and Chaos Marines. Each team poses different tactics/strategic elements which make you play them differently. The Orcs are based more around unit massing and rapid base expansion. While the Eldar are more about unit specialization and micro base management. The Space Marines and Chaos Marines are essentially the same team set, and fit between tactics of the Orcs and Eldar. Each of the teams units have upgradeable attributes which customize them for specific purposes: weapons, additional squad members, and squad leader units. Each team has special commander units which can be used as heroes buffing the team and supporting military units.   Results:  All and all Dawn of War is a must get game. If you can play older games without constantly yearning for the graphics of the modern day games then you’ll enjoy this game. The gameplay is not outdated, but rather refreshing. As it seems most strategy game developers have diverted from base building, resource management, and mass scale war to simple micromanagement tactic games. I loved this game and all the installments so much I repurchased them all on steam. Despite that I still have all the discs, in functional condition, right next to me.   Pros: +Economic, Base building, and macro unit management +Fantastic story and campaign (which is very rare in a strategy game) +Amazing teams which each play completely differently. +Fast paced gameplay which requires expansion to acquire resource nodes (but those nodes do not run out like in most games) +Unit customization allows you to create squads for specific tasks +Fantastic computer AI that puts you to your wits  Cons: -Cannot play this game while having another monitor running (if you have two monitors the game will launch but every time you move the mouse to the edge of the screen where your monitor extends the mouse exits the game as if you are playing in Windowed mode). -Lots of unbalances (don’t worry they fix all of these in the later installments)",

            "review_text": "I'm a huge RTS fan, but for whatever reason, I never picked this up until recently. I was introduced to the Warhammer 40,000 universe by way of the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine third person shooter, which I greatly enjoyed. This universe has intrigued me since then, and I have tried to catch up with the more long-term fans of the franchise by reading up on the lore and such online. It's quite different from most fantasy; where magic and medieval type weaponry is common in fantasy, Warhammer has a refreshing spin on things, relying more on machinery and gunplay while keeping the magic and awe the fantasy genre offers to players. It also falls in the area of dystopian, which is by far my favorite genre of any entertainment, and it is interesting to have a protagonist in this game whose ideals and beliefs could be viewed as fanatical by our standards, but would be understandable in such a future where he serves beneath a totalitarian empire.  Moving on from the universe to the gameplay, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is an RTS that is unique in its approach to a genre that is tried and true. Whereas many RTS games focus on base building and annihilation, this game simplifies the base building and relies more on strategical points that you must capture for resource generation throughout the map. Each campaign or skirmish mission 'gets going', so-to-speak, much more quickly than other RTS games. You spend less time buiding and more time moving your armies along the map. For those that find some in the genre to be slow moving in the beginning, Dawn of War brings a welcome change.   Something else that Dawn of War does well that not enough RTS games do (sometimes at all) is reinforcements and upgrades. Where some games have you upgrade units from their respective recruitment centers and it encompasses all units of the same type, Dawn of War gives you more choice in how you want them upgraded. You can build a group of Space Marines, add reinforcements (making an initial group of four into up to eight), add sergeants later on, commanders, etc. In addition, with upgrades you can have a few men within the group upgrade their weapons, and the selection of weapons is up to you. You can have four rocket launchers, two rocket launchers, one flamethrower, and a laser pistol, or any combination between. This gives the player an ability to build up a small army for one intention (rocket launchers are great at taking out vehicles and buildings, for example), while creating another for a different intention (sending a differently equipped army to fight infantry). Even within firefights, you can reinforce your army if you possess the resources, giving the player a second chance in battle when most RTS games give none.  Lastly, it should be noted that I am a single player only strategy player, so I buy games like this for the campaign and skirmishes. In saying that, this game's campaign is fantastic. While somewhat short (eleven missions and about 15 hours of gameplay; note that Steam did not track all of my game time), the story is quite good and involving, taking you across many different types of landscapes and introducing you to different races to fight against. The cutscenes are a bit stilted due to the game's age, and the voice acting (while over-dramatic at times) is fantastic. The missions are vast and varied, and the game never gets in the habit of annoying you with time limits (I hate timed missions in any game, personally). The missions were challenging without being impossible, and they were friendly to both players who like to rush and complete the missions, and players like me, who like to leisurely explore the whole map and take over all positions before deciding to fully vanquish my enemy. Skirmishes are available, offering a few dozen maps that you can choose to play on, giving you choices as to what colors your army wears to which races you fight against, along with a whole myriad of other choices to make to tweak your gameplay if you so choose.   In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a fantastic RTS title that makes me very happy I purchased the Master Collection of games, because I am looking forward to experiencing more of this interesting universe. I would recommend it to any fans of RTS, as well as those looking to get into the genre, as this game is extraordinarily user friendly and has a fantastic tutorial. If you are unsure, I urge you to try the demo. I played the demo some time before buying the game and loved what it offered, so it is a fair representation of the game. I can see myself adding this to a list of games I come back to every now and then, because it offers a truly unique strategy experience that stands apart from others. I went into this game with no expectations other than what I'd read through some of the reviews, and after beating it, I consider myself a fan.",

The Story is pretty interesting as you progress through it, there's no multiplayer due to GameSpy shutting down, but you can still setup a battle with the CPU, up to roughly 8 players, or 4v4 on a map. Definitely worth the payout! I give this game a 10/10. Just because it's old doesn't mean it sucks......well that's debateable, but still, GET IT !!!",

Unit controls and micro functions are lacking, but this is back in the day of 20 or 40 unit population limit, and 8 squads to a keybind.

While the campaign is only 11 missions long and feels paced a little faster than it probably should be, the game attempts to compensate with each level taking anywhere between 1-2.5 hours, which probably explains why the story may have been rushed. If you're a veteran of the RTS Genre, you may find the core game's campaign to be easy and manage to clear every level without failure. Overall it's a story that justifies your actions and explores a small fragment of what it's like to be part of the Imperium of Man if nothing else, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. 3.5/5  -Graphics: The game was made in 2004, as a result the graphics you're going to see are going to be a little dated in contrast to the more modern landscapes and character designs known today, even on the higher settings. As a result, the textures are going to be rather bland and lacking in detail in some places. Obvious geometry for the most part isn't too noticeable, however animations are rather rigid and limited and you will probably start seeing the same actions get repeated, especially during the Campaign cutscenes. Even with all the advancements in graphics throughout the years, Dawn of War ages surprisingly well. You'll be able to notice the bloodshed, corpses, bullet holes and explosion residue left in craters as the battles rage, even if there are a few limitations. The buildings are animated, so you'll know if your stuff is damaged, being built or whether something's happening, which is always useful in a fast-paced skirmish where information is vital. Every faction has their own distinct style that's present in their architecture and Game UI, preventing the player from confusing one side for another. Overall, the game's graphics aren't the best I've seen, but it's pretty remarkable considering what was available at the time. 4/5  -Gameplay: Dawn of War is one of the simpler RTS games in terms of complexity. The map is already drawn with every key point identified, however fog of war still exists, ensuring that reconnaissance is still important. There are only two resources to collect: Requisition and Power, with the former being automatically generated (but sped up as you explore the map and claim more points) and the latter requiring the player to construct generators to collect. Because of how requisition works, one never has to worry about the map being depleted of resources and being unable to build things, although it becomes much more difficult to construct anything when you have less buildings and points to generate resources. There are also few kinds of units, which allow for simpler yet fewer strategies. You will only encounter infantry, land vehicles and builders. Fortunately the game not only classifies infantry as groups that can be reinforced and improved with your resources wherever they're located, it also avoids adding defenseless builders when you attempt to select your army. There are four factions by default with more added in DLC, each promoting different strategies and play styles, but you're most likely going to be acquainted with the Jack of All Stat Space Marines from the campaign and the tutorial levels. Speaking of the tutorial, every key aspect playing the game is covered in an easy to understand way that will allow newcomers to at least figure out what they're supposed to be doing. One thing I will complain about is how limited the camera zooming is, as I tend to be unable to select all of my units that start occupying the entire screen, and at times your units may have difficulty simply going where you request them to, but not very often. Before I forget, there is one aspect that separates Dawn of War from other Real-Time Strategy games: Morale. Yes, the often mistakenly overlooked aspect of war that must be maintained within your ranks. Morale determines the survival of your units, and once its depleted they will start missing more often than a stormtrooper at point-blank range. Naturally there are commander units that exist to boost morale and/or break enemy spirit that can be bound to infantry squads and can prove to be dangerous units with enough research and training. Because of how morale works, it's never a good idea to send in a strike team that's outnumbered. To summarize everything that was just typed, Dawn of War is one of the less complex RTS games you'll find, but that doesn't make it necessarily easy or boring. 4/5  -Sound: Everything sounds like what you'd expect it to, weapons, vehicles and all. Each faction has their own idiosyncratic set of sound cues you'll associate them with. While it is a minor annoyance to hear your units make an announcement every single time something involving them changes, anything said will always be relevant to the given situation with examples such as “Squad broken!” and “Under fire!”. Everything your units say is not only standard, but reveals more of the personalities behind the unit type and the faction they hail from. The background music is usually faint compared to the action, which is a good thing in this case because it doesn't distract from the more important aspect of this game: Warfare. While the background music fits the scenario, there isn't much else to say about this limited track. Aside from the necessary announcements and some extra filler to avoid having the game sound too quiet, sound wasn't much of a focus on this game. 3.5/5  -Replayability: As games grow older and remain active through time, their replay value gradually diminishes and Dawn of War is no exception. While the campaign may keep one occupied anywhere between a few days to a week at most, there is no real incentive to play this game for very long. Skirmish mode may be fun for a few rounds to experiment with other factions and strategies, but aside from that there isn't much to say. While there might have been an active multiplayer for the core game in the past, hardly anyone tends to roam the lobbies anymore. Unless you know of other people who own the core game, you may end up never setting foot in the multiplayer community. Fortunately there are three DLC expansion packs that can add more vitality for the game, with the majority of them being well-received as they incorporate new factions, campaigns and possibly fixes to whatever bugs exist and updates for the graphics. With what little exists in the core game, DLC is practically a necessity, although it's important to keep in mind that Dawn of War has a sequel where the majority of users have most likely migrated to. A little distressing, but what do you expect from an old game? It's a miracle it's still even active. 3.5/5  Summary/TL;DR:  Dawn of War may not be the most complex Real-Time Strategy game out there, but that doesn't make it any less fun. Overall score: 18.5/25 or 74%*  *Note: This score is for the core game itself. The expansion packs have not been evaluated by this user and may change the score.",

There is base building, but it doesn't require an insane amount of micro-managing like SC2 does, for example. What makes this game so enjoyable to me is that you spend the majority of your time managing your massive army and it's just straight up fun to do.  The campaign is OK and worth a single playthrough. Just be prepared for drawn out conversations, overly wordy narration, and some incredibly terrible voice acting (though it does have a particular charm). The meat and potatoes is the multiplayer mode, which you can play against CPU bots or online. In this version of the game you can pick between four factions which include Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and Chaos.  Highly recommended.",

They're definitely more focused on more multitasking and bigger squadrons. That kind of stuff honestly just hurts my brain. I much prefer DoW2's 4-Hero Unit campaign structure, and it's Last Stand mode (though now largely unplayed).  As far as multiplayer goes, I cannot comment, as I know my role there.

The plot's fleshed out by interesting and some what lengthy cutscenes before and after each mission. The voice actors in the game are very over the top and sometimes cheesy, but they manage to fit each character well and the voice acting actually comes away as a very bright spot in the game for me.  Game-play wise there isn't a whole lot of 'new' here compared to other RTS games, but what is included is polished. For its release date I consider the game to be very technically capable with things like decent character animations and solid over-all performance. Fans of RTS games or the Warhammer franchise should definitely give this one a shot.",

Units come in squads, you can resupply squads in the field, units shoot without you having to tell them to shoot, capture points, attaching heroes and healers to squads, upgrading. This all made it feel different and exciting and also very much like a Warhammer 40k game (Not a big 40k fan, but WH Fantasy fan, definitely).  The story is ♥♥♥♥, the voice acting atrocious, but the gameplay makes up for that. I do have to say I only played the singleplayer campaign (I'm not really into skirmishes and definitely no MP).

Sure, the voice-acting can be corny at times, but then that's part of the game's charm.   It's by no means perfect. The AI sometimes has pathing issues, and on occasion there are times were the campaign makes odd choices with some of your units (such as putting the Whirlwind artillery tanks in the Cease Fire stance by default). And of course, there is the mess that is Soulstorm. Even so, I found the game immensely enjoyable for the most part, both as a fan of Warhammer 40k and as a fan of strategy games.",

There's a good variety of units, base building isn't a grind, and the Warhammer series IMHO has THE BEST balance of any strategy games I've ever played. You get into the action quickly and new units are introduced pretty much as soon as you're ready for them.   I'll put this one up against Starcraft (which I feel is a good benchmark for RTS games) any day of the week. My only recommendation would be to get the expansion packs too if you can. The campaign is 11 missions long and seemed to go by too quickly to me. However, that may have been because I enjoyed the game so much.",
