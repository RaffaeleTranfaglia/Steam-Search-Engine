            "review_text": "The premise is charming and original, the music is nice and relaxing, the art style is cute, and the cutscenes are enjoyable to watch. However, I had to drop the game since I simply was not having any fun playing it.  My biggest issue with the game is how big a role trial and error plays. You can only flip tiles that are around your character, and most elements necessary to your progress, such as platforms and springs, are completely hidden from view at first, meaning that you have to keep jumping around (often to your demise) trying to find out where everything is. The second problem is how precise the game wants you to be. Everything you do must be executed with perfect accuracy, yet the stiff controls and the wonky hit detection will often get in your way of doing so, especially in later levels.   I really wanted to like this game, but those two issues, paired with a quite uneven difficulty level, wore me down. If you want to try this game out, I would recommend waiting for a sale, like I did. I definitely do not feel like it is worth the full price.",

            "review_text": "This game just flys over my head... it oughta be a typical (cute artstyled) 2D platformer but you don't just run and jump to the exit, no, the level consists of tiles, if you pass them the tiles will turn and reveal the backside wich can or cannot contian something else, so it is a puzzle platformer where you need to uncover all the tiles first before you know what to to. It's tedious, it's demotivating, I don't like the concept.",

            "review_text": "A mediocre, painfully monotonous puzzle platformer. The minimal challenge present is largely artificial, often based on some combination of biased hit detection, erratic enemy patterns or awkward portal jumping.  I do give it credit for its appropriately saccharine concept, but Sugar Cube isn't really worth wading through for that alone.",

            "review_text": "Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory is a small platformer with a fun twist. You play as a sugar cube and you are trying to escape a factory where u will be baked or worse EATEN! In order to escape you must platform your way through 5 worlds and dodge many enemies and pitfalls along the way. Luckily you have the ability to shift the area around you. This only affects the area around you and can be toggled with shift. This ability is mandatory to clear most levels and is a fun ability to use. The boss battles are just puzzles and all you have to do is get around them. There are extra collectibles to pick up most of them are easy and if you collect them all you unlock the true ending. Overall if you are craving a puzzle platformer with a twist give this a try.",

            "review_text": "Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory is a 2D puzzle-platformer with a very colourful look to it. You play as a Sugar Cube and you go throughout 5 factories, each with its own theme and set of mechanics.  I've played through the whole game and got every collectible in about 2 hours. If you're someone who's looking for a lengthy platformer with a lot of content, look elsewhere.    As usual, I'll start out with  presentation .   As you can probably guess from the screenshots and its name, this is a game with a very child friendly artstyle. And whether or not you consider this a good thing, everything fits together quite well. Both the visual design, the music and sound effects feel to go well together, all working towards the same atmosphere. Animation isn't too detailed or smooth. It's actually very minimalistic, but it does the job. I personally didn't have an issue with it. So, all in all, I think they've done a good job there.   On the other hand, this is a style that doesn't appeal to me, at all. Still, that's not enough reason for one not to play a game if it's good enough, but despite the game looking solid, it doesn't really stand out from the crowd of puzzle-platformers around, in my opinion.   Now, the  structure  of the game. Bittersweet Factory is comprised of 5 different factories, each of a different ingredient. Each of these factories revolves around a couple of mechanics, mostly different in each one. There are 17 levels + a 'Boss' level in the end of each factory, which start out by teaching the player the mechanics, and then getting a bit more complex.  A negative aspect of it is that the Bosses don't really pose a challenge, and the only objective in those level is to avoid them, and getting to the door.    Since this is a 2D Puzzle-platformer, its  mechanics  are the core of the game. As I said, each factory has a set of mechanics. These, however, are fairly generic, and can be found in a lot of other games. For example, different tiles and be sticky for you to wall jump, others are slippery to give you momentum, portals, etc. In the game's favour, they try to tie those mechanics logically with the candy theme, and do a fairly good job of it. But that's visually, as they can be (and are) disguised as virtually everything, being very common in most of these games.  Now, its core mechanic is cool, but at the same time, a bit clunky. I liked the idea, but the execution felt sloppy at times, leading to some trial and error in levels, that could have been avoided. The mechanic is that each level is made of tiles, and each tile can be flipped, revealing a whole different level, at times. These tiles can be platforms, spikes, switches, you name it.   You flip tiles as you walk by them, and there are 'powerups' to change the direction in which you'll switch the tiles. Another very important aspect of it, is a way of not flipping the tiles (With Left/Right Button in a controller, or the Shift key). This way, you'll avoid flipping tiles that are needed for your destination more easily, and it's actually required in many levels.  A big problem is that while there is some visual confirmation of what you need to flip, at times, it mostly comes down to trial and error. You'll find yourself trying to flip a whole lot of tiles at logical parts of the level until you find the best way. And, even when you did, it can be tricky to flip the right tiles at once (which is the reasoning for me finding it clunky at times).  I have mixed feelings about the mechanics. I seems a bunch of canon concepts thrown into the levels, thinly held together.    Level Design  felt very similar, as a direct result of the mechanics. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. Besides, it was a very easy game. I'm usually pretty bad at these types of games, often getting stuck in many puzzles. This one, however, had me moving through it very quickly, barely having to think to solve each level, which is a shame.  While being stuck at a level may be frustrating, it's also very rewarding to finally figure it out, and it's more often than not simple solutions that simply require a different thought proccess. While the tile flipping mechanic involves some of said change in thought proccess, the game didn't seem built upon it, but more as a common platformer.     Final Thoughts ? As a result of both its difficulty and artstyle, I'd find myself recommending it mostly for younger children, but not for anyone with any experience in these games, or simply looking for challenging puzzles.  To be honest, it's a very hard genre to be in, with the huge amount of awesome games with very unique mechanics that are very closely tied with their worlds and characters. This game may be cheaper than most, but I'd still recommend something like The Swapper, Braid, Closure or Thomas was Alone if you're looking for a 2D Puzzle Platformer that's really good and/or unique.  This game unfortunately doesn't manage to keep up with its rivals. Still, as a first entry form the developer, it's not too bad.",
