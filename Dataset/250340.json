            "review_text": "I got into Blockland back in 2005 when I was just 11 years old, and back then it was a free game that looked just like Legos, and ever since then, I've seen people and friends come and go, rivalries with other games that were only similar in the concept of 'sandbox game where you can build and destroy anything'.  As someone who had practically no social interaction prior, this game and it's community actually helped me grow and mature as a person, I've met so many cool, intelligent, talented and funny people over the years and even became friends with some of them, and it got me in to basic C++ scripting, 3D modeling, audio editing, and even a bit of video making. It is at this point that I feel like I owe my life to this game. Even to this day, I find myself coming back to this game every now and then to build something, to create a new mod, try out someone else's mod, or to just goof about on servers.  This game, for me, and several others, is like the 'Hotel California' of video games, you may leave, you may stop playing for a while, but you always come back, for one reason or another. Even those who don't like this game or it's community and get banned for their actions keep spending more of their money just to come back, it's like a drug that you just can't quit!  For the 11 years I've been at this game, I've been very active on the message boards, and it's been such an interesting, funny, and unique community over the years, and I've been able to watch it grow and change as time went on, like, I've never been so invested in a community as I am with Blockland's.  I do hope that Blockland becomes as popular as games like Roblox, some may disagree with me on this, that they prefer this smaller and more controlled crowd of people, but Blockland really does deserves a bigger audience, it actually is a fun and amazing game. It may be slow and tedious to build something big and amazing, but that's how building is with every sandbox game, ' Rome wasn't built in a day .', and if building isn't your thing, there's just a big variety of gamemodes and servers out there that are PvP death-matches, role playing servers, a boss battle server, knife fights in the sky with grappling hooks, dog fights, single-lap races, multi-lap races-- there's just so many to choose from, you're bound to find something you like!  The biggest problem with the game is ' time ', what time of the day you get on matters, what time-zone you live in compared to other people matters, what day of the week it is matters, time is a big factor in finding busy and/or good quality servers.  While I recommend this game, I also commend checking out the message boards, there you can chillax and talk amongst others that play the game, get help with the game, post pictures of things you built or did, download add-ons or other sorts of mods that people make, or just talk about whatever else, about other video games, or about drawings or other sorts of creative things you or other people do!",

Then, I came back a year later, seeing no maps, and got slightly angry for a few days, and then got over it to see what it'd become. Bad, good, decent, hilarious, pathetic; Those were all going through my head as I relearned Blockland, although this time, I learned something new - Events. Eventing in Blockland is personally my favorite part (followed closely by the capability of them, and what you can make out of them). I still have a weekly rage session, just because some stupid thing happened in-game, but I don't mind. It's still among my favorite games.

The addons you can acquire make the game fifty times better and they add more possibilties than the default vanilla game. The shadows and shaders replaced maps back in 2012, which I think was very bad idea; a lot of the fun things are no longer there, like skiing on The Slopes map. The community is also very garbage; I steer as far as possible from the forums (besides the addon section), especially the drama section.  All in all, have friends to play with, get tons of addons, stay away from 95% of the community, and have some fun.",

            "review_text": "Blockland has a bit of a history. In 2005, it was a little work-in-progress building game on the Torque Game Engine. Being an alpha, it had (here comes a massive understatement) quite a few mods that generated a larger following. The full game released in 2007, and much more polished than anything seen before. Streams of updates from the game's sole creator (with some collaboration thrown in) in the past six years have created a unique game that nothing can hope to come close to.  So, what's the main point? Blockland is That Game Where You Build Stuff. It's all on you, and the community. Using LEGO-like blocks to create structures in online multiplayer may sound mundane on paper, but the online part is where it really shines. The amount of creativity Blockland players have is nothing short of amazing. User-created add-ons like weapons and vehicles are plentiful, allowing for different and fun gamemodes within buildings YOU create, and an 'events' system gives way for even more creativity within builds.  An accessible sandbox game for such a price is almost a steal.",

            "review_text": "This game, this game right here is really, really awesome! It's like playing with legos, on the computer, and you don't have to buy the said legos. This game is what I have played a lot, just like another game I've played a lot. If you love legos, and are too lazy to get the money to buy real legos, then this game is for you. And one of the awesome things is that you can host your own server if you wanted, and addons are really easy to install. I recommend this game to people who have someform of creativity and loves legos. Just becarful when exploring the server list, there are some strange servers out there... not saying all of the servers are bad, just some of those servers could cause you to lose your sanity being there. I happen to host a server, though I don't get very many players thanks to certaint people who shan't be named for reasons that I will not tell you about. Though there can be some downsides to this game, it tends to cause weaker computers to crash, which is annoying since I have a horrable computer, but if you know what you're doing, and keep the addon count small, you'll be fine with hosting a server, and don't be afraid to ban people, they break the rules on your server, so it gives you the full right to ban them. And there are other people who complan about how bad the server is, and here's a little tip when dealing with them, simply tell them this 'My server, my rules. If you got a problem with this, then get off of my server.' and then ban them if they do not stop, and if you don't want them returning day after day, calling you some very rude, and stupid, names, then perma ban them, like I said, it's your server, you decide how it works, if people don't like it, then they don't like it. You can't change that. And be sure to be a very kind person so people like you, if you do that, more and more people will show up on your server. These are my words of wisdom for hosting a server, I'd share my wisdom on how to not be banned on other servers within five seconds, but I do not have time for that today. Good luck, my good people, you're going to need it. Also, check out my some of my guides for Blockland, I only have one at the moment, but feel free to check them out!",

            "review_text": "I remember having given Blockland in Christmas of 2009 (And re-buying and still playing it via Steam at this point). And back in the day, it tended to be a clone of Roblox in terms of building blocks and other notible assets. Which THEN, a few months ago, made people point out 'AAAH THIS IS MINECRAFT BUT ALL SCRATCHY AND SHIZZ' and was going like that ever since. Yup, I know how you Minecraft peoples are.  So for this review, I'm not only going to review this game, but compare this to Minecraft a bit, and why I sometimes like to dub this 'Hipster Minecraft'.  So basically what Blockland is, is a first-person sandbox multiplayer create-your-own-anything game. SOUND FAMILIAR??? You control inhabitants known as 'Blockheads' and build anything, Yup, quite familiar. HOWEVER, you do NOT start in a pre-generated world. It is a flatgrass-style area you find yourself in. All saves you make are only builds, and not whole worlds, which is not as convoluted as Minecraft as all you can do to get a build you made is straight-up load it like a schematic.  Now for building things and designing games, functions, etc.: You can see building is quite advanced and more difficult than Minecraft. But it's great if you want a first-person Sandbox building game with more detailed models than Minecraft, as Minecraft is all 1-meter blocks and very flat compared to Blockland blocks. For functions, you can use a Wrench to make blocks emit light and particles, as well as implement functions to make games and programming. Minecraft pretty much does the same thing with Command Blocks, etc., but IMO, Blockland is more simple than Minecraft in terms of functions. Because Minecraft's functioning requires specific functions and assets, sometimes extra mods, to make a good mechanism.   I MIGHT be missing something here, as I have never tried such functions myself in Minecraft, but I should say that you have no information to design Minecraft functioning whatsoever unless you use the internet, which I don't really like doing given how the Minecraft community is nowadays.  Blockland may be difficult and advanced to build than Minecraft, with all the little blocks to use and everything, but I found that it's much simpler to build what I want without getting my ♥♥♥♥ kicked in Minecraft trying to obtain a specific asset for my work. People would say Minecraft is waaaay better than Blockland that they hate this game, but I'm one of the few who played it back then and had a good time, speaking of which...  Everybody knows Minecraft is the way to go besides Blockland. But for the nosalgia, or stuff Minecraft can't as mentioned above, I play this. I'm one of the few who actually like this game and I'm glad it doesn't have a fustercluck of a community like Minecraft, which is what I was anxious to point out. I really admire how quiet and underrated Blockland and its community is compared to Minecraft, and even Roblox as well. (I also played Roblox and it was pretty cheezy). Minecraft's majority of fans has pretty much bubble-bursted, where Blockland is 'Just right', however getting beat down by Minecraft.  But I will say this as I finish up this review.  Blockland came years before Minecraft . It is not exactly a ripoff of Minecraft, which I apparently am seeing an award of which this game attained. I give this game a thumbs up, as it was what got me going before Minecraft was all the rage. This is just my opinion though. I'm only proving a point about Blockland vs Minecraft, and NO I do not think Blockland &lt; Minecraft. It's all the Minecraft tweenies that are implying that this game is crapple. When I play Minecraft, I have that feeling that I shouldn't be playing this game anymore, whereas in Blockland, it's calm and I don't need to be reminded by the overdose Minecraft has become. (I still like Minecraft though)",

            "review_text": "This game is mind-blowingly awesome. You want to abuse rapid firing rockets via an event system or just want to build a humble little home? Well, here's your solution.  I reccomend the first thing you'd want to do is go to Start A Game and click on the Tutorial gamemode. Then start this game and make it singleplayer and follow the steps shown on screen.  The game uses an easy to install add-on system, which is basically finding the Steam directory on your computer (Windows: Steam &gt; SteamApps &gt; Common &gt; Blockland) and dragging and dropping your selected file into the AddOns Folder. I think this system will eventually be modded and changed to work with Steam Workshop like Garry's Mod. Once you have the right addons and knowledge of how to use them, the possibilities for a good server are endless.  The building mechanics are very simple once you get the hang of them - simply using the numpad/your selected control scheme to maneuver the blocks into the right place and pressing Enter when your ''Ghost Brick (Invisible brick you will see when you click the ground to move a block around) is above a support or another block. Then you can use the Paint Can (default key is E) to paint this block a selected colour.  Physics-wise, this game is absolutely mad. If you think it's hilarious to have your car flung into oblivion then this game is definitely the one you want. This also kind of falls into the category of graphics. This game's visuals are not the best, but definitely better than Minecraft's. (Sorry Notch.)  The game uses an eventing system which is a basic scripting mechanism. I think there should be a guide somewhere on the magic that is the Steam page, and that also tells you the rest about the game.    Also, little LEGO guys. They're so cute.   10/10 would build giant castle again.",

It's a game where you don't grab pre-made things from garry's mod and actually create your own structures / and vice versa. It really is like playing with legos on the internet, but with the modding scene for this game, the game feels less like a game for 5-year olds and more for new scripters to get into coding, as it's extremely easy to make a bricks/gun/vehicle/light/effect and put it straight onto your server for people to see.  The community right now is filled with a bunch of angsty teenagers who like to ddos for no apparent reason, but it really is rare to have your server ddos'd unless you anger the community that much.",

The system for building is very comprehensive and efficient once you learn the controls. There's fun stuff like weapons and vehicles for all your death match needs.

            "review_text": "I'll be very simple with the review since it's not a game that you need to over-complicate or go too in-depth with the details of. Blockland is a lego-like sandbox game in which you can create and design any kind of world or server you could ever desire. The game can be compared to the sandbox 'Garry's Mod', which also centers on a player-driven system.  Like Garry's Mod, this game is somewhat of a niche, yet because of it's marketed open-endedness and scope, as well as low price and system requirements has been marketed to mass public. And like Garry's Mod, this is a game for specific people, and not the mass market.  The community has been accused of being focuses of drama and controversy and the forum and game policing has said to be flimsy at best, but this is a community driven game, again, like Garry's Mod. And on top of that, this game was developed in a time period in which indie games struggled quite a bit to get on their feet. This combined with the rare lifespan that this game has exhibbited has picked up a lot of baggage over the years, just like anything would. And the high social learning curve that comes with this game isn't exactly friendly to new players. What I mean is that each server is maintained and controlled be either a board of admins that the host has chosen to moderate and maintain the server, or a singular admin. How that admin wants to host and represent that server is up to them. People who like the hosts ideals will likely drift towards the servers with those admins, making sub-cultures in the game world.  The best thing for a new player to do is find a server with friendly new players and slowly intigrate into the community, otherwise you will most likely irritate the sometimes easily irritatable inhabitance of the game.  All in all, coming from a 'veteran' player that watched this game grow and grow over the years, I'd say that it is enjoyable, so long as you can find a server community that you can intigrate with, you will have no problem with the community. As for the game, it's a high customisable sandbox game. That's pretty much the depth of it.",

But, appart from that, on single-player its actually pretty peaceful. You can make ideas for your server that you're 'going' to make, or just have fun freebuilding.

I thought you might want to read this before you actually get into the game, so you have a little notion of what you're doing. The building style uses the Numpad keys, 123456789 and 0, the Numpad keys move the brick to where you want it to go, without clicking somewhere and it goes. Overall-review: 9/10.

I've watched the community grow and change and I've probably spent several hundred hours on the game before it came to Steam.  Blockland is a creative sandbox game created in 2004 by Badspot. A lot of people say it's kind of like Lego Garry's Mod, which isn't far from the truth. I love this game to pieces and always have, but it does have certain flaws that can seriously hinder the experience at times.  The game is great because you can do nearly anything, but the community is a bit... strange, at times. There are two groups of people in the game: the noobs that don't know how anything works, and the old-timers that are either very supportive of newcomers or are spiteful towards them. There's not much middle ground between these groups and quite a lot of the veteran players have left the game since v21 was released, a few months before the game came to Steam.  The biggest actual gameplay drawbacks will be very obvious within the first couple hours of playing: a bad physics engine and subpar graphics. The physics engine has been buggy and unpredictable since the game's creation, although the graphics are actually substantially better now than before.  Possibly the only thing that has really kept me playing the game this long is the giant amount of user-made content that can be found on the official forums. The custom add-ons really bring the game to life and it's somewhat bland without them. Nearly every popular server runs many add-ons, allowing for an even more custom and unique experience.  Due to its Garry's Mod-like sandbox nature, Blockland has also inspired several notable video makers on YouTube, including Teneksi, Filipe1020, 8bitcube, Flubbman97, SirHerg1, and others.  I'm trying not to be too wordy, so I'll just do pros and cons now cuz I'm boring like that.  Pros:  - Great building system allowing for near-endless creativity - Lots of great public servers to join - Huge catalog of mods and add-ons - Not difficult to set up a server (can be tricky sometimes if your internet is weird) - Community has lots of nice people that will help new players learn the game - Low price  Cons:  - Buggy physics - Average graphics - Controls can take a while to get used to - Not frequently updated (back in the day there was usually an update every couple weeks or so, but there hasn't been anything major since January 2014 as of this review) - Community has lots of trolls  The community is both a pro and a con because depending on who you meet, it could really go either way.  Overall, I would say the game is definitely one of my favorite games of all time and even if you don't like it, it's only $10 USD spent. That's really all there is to say about the game, and I hope you try it out!",

It happened to me and my friend.Third of all theirs adventure of course.My favorite adventure servers is KONGS deathrace,The black parrots falling platforms,and dogfights.Kongs server is ,cars racing to the endyou have a temate or none and you try to kill your oponet or try to win by driving to the house in both maps.The black parrots falling platforms is ,jumping around colors and rockets shot at you but you cant be color blind and you have to read to know wich color to stand on.Then dogfights :) you drive planes and helicopters KILL eachother and capture bases ! :D So i do think blockland is an amazing game but please do not buy this if your realy young .BUT if you need help just go to badspot they run it all. I THINK! But warning dont save others stuff oly on your server",

Another thing I like is the amount of bricks and objects you get, you get quite alot, more if you use the custom gamemode. (even more with plugins) Another thing I like is the avatar maker, you can randomize it or make your own guy, there's a great selection of hats, stuff on your T-shirt and etc. So overall I'd rate this game 10/10",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. ",

            "review_text": " This is a response to LewnaJa and DarkByte97's  awful review  of this game.   LewnaJa &amp; DarkByte97, a review of a game consists of a review of the GAME. What you are doing is reviewing the developer, lack of updates (which is not required for a game that's finished), the community (everyone aint ♥♥♥♥♥ if you would open your eyes) and the trailer (you can actually do what is highlighted, several mods, if you would open your eyes again). This is highly irrelevant for the game quality itself.  The only game-reviewing elements of your review concerns: building, content-implementation, how it is broken.  1. You state the building is 'not easy'. I disagree. The building in this game is great. Very easy, very effective. If you still don't find yourself building neat things, you lack of creativity and/or will. You state a lack of help in building. Now if you were to befriend the community, you  recieve  help. Besides I've found a  good guide  that addresses common design flaws in building. You also state it is 'time-consuming'. Well many things are time-consuming, but I'd be better off learning how to build than looking at pointless videos and images at Facebook (or spread lies about this game for that matter).  2. You state the game has not recieved any updates since the Event System in v9 (correct me if I'm wrong). That is a big lie, the shaders, which I fancy, bug fixes, UPnP (v14) integration, treasure chest, cannon, rowboat, player persistence, some gamemodes and the official integration of amazing mods (speedkart, blood and gore, modular terrain bricks) qualifies.  3. You state the game is 'near-broken'. I disagree. It is clearly not broken, the game functions very well and it is very rare that I stumble upon a bug or something that contributes to game-breaking.  Another lie you spread.   In your conclusion you state the game is not bad. I can agree on that one and to correct your understating description of this game, the game is amazingly fun given the right engagement. You also state that the game has no future updates or a community with people who enjoy the game. You cannot predict, if Badspot will update the game once again. Besides it is not his responsibility, as you  BUY  the game alone and not continuous updates. And I don't see how you can state the game does not consist of people who enjoy it? If they weren't enjoying it, they wouldn't be playing it. The community is again not the developers responsibility.  Oh and you also note it does not have friendly technical support, I cannot correct you on this, because I've never needed any technical support as the game has functioned almost flawless for me since I started playing this game in 2008. (v8, I believe, way before it came out on Steam)  ANYONE supporting this review are blind and lack of engagement in this game in order for them to enjoy it. I suggest you stay away from this game. I don't want this game polluted by your sad existence. ANYONE supporting this game and contributing to the game in whatever way, thank you for making this game better. Thank you.  TL;DR: LewnaJa and DarkByte97's review consists of lies and its focus lies on game-irrelevant topics. Badspot may be a mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but his game is amazingly fun.",

(For people actually interested in making stuff, you could build a structure, apply events to it that allow certain things to happen caused by certain triggers, paint it and apply effects, etc.)  Also thousands of people bought it at $20, and it's now $10, so... buy it.",

Its a game where you can do whatever you want, and build whatever you want. The possibilities with this game seem nearly endless.

If things have changed then the devs deserve a big round of applause for moving so far forward. If everything is the same then I really wonder what the heck I was thinking on my original review. That said here are my revised opinions.  An excellent tutorial gets you up and going in no time. An option has been added to choose whether you have a laptop or not so now controls are less confusing. Building is still a little slower going than many other block based games but it is very precise, so you don't waste time placing bricks where you do not want them. I'm getting faster at placement all the time now so I guess it is just a matter of getting used to them. The meat and potatoes of the game are the many different game modes. There is a bit of everything here: Racing, pirates, a treasure hunt and even just plain old building. I think i'm going to get some more of my friends to try this one out: I'm guessing this is a gas with some buddies around to torment.  Game performance is quite good and everything runs really smooth. I love the shading and just Lego-y look to it all. Blockland sets out to do it's own thing and I am really enjoying it. Don't expect it to be Minecraft: It has blocks, you can build stuff and that is all they have in common. This is a good thing. Kick back and enjoy the mayhem. From now on Blockland will stay on that limited real estate on my Macbook Air's hard drive. I'm happy to turn that thumb around to the up position for this one!",

It crashed the application. I ended up having to hit 'Command' &amp; 'Q' to exit the application on my iMac. After that, the application kept crashing and wouldn't boot anymore.  I had to delete the application's preferences file to get it to boot up in the default settings again. I had to keep doing this until I got the game working in the desired resolution and video settings. Below is the location of the Blockland prefs.cs file in OS X version 10.6.8, in case you run into this problem:  username/Library/Application Support/ Steam/SteamApps/common/Blockland/config/client/prefs.cs  The game is running fine now in window mode only though… I believe the only thing that actually crashed the application was trying to run it in Full Screen mode. I have everything turned up as high as I can. The games graphics are a little dated, but they still look okay.  Again, you only need to either rename or trash the Blockland prefs.cs file to get the game to launch again in the default settings mode. After you get the game settings the way you want them and it's not crashing anymore you can safely play the game. Just do not try running it in Full Screen mode again.  I am not going to review this game yet. I need to plugin my 3 button mouse and maybe my other keyboard that has a keypad. This game requires as many input devices as you can supply! lol It's very hard to build with the standard Macintosh mouse and keyboard!  I will say this, I got this game on sale for $3.99 USD, so it's not that bad of a game so far for that price. The content supplied keep me busy for a little while so far and I'm going back after writing this… I just wanted to make sure that you had some troubleshooting advice here. :-)  Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8.",

I've met a lot of great people who definitley do not fit into this category. Therefore, in order to solve the community problem, just stick with the right crowd. Saying this game is bad because of the community is like saying your neighborhood is terrible because you have a handful of lousy neighbors, even when you could live in a place like Bel-Air.

            "review_text": "[If you dislike reading seemingly irrelevant information you are free to skip to the bottom of this review. There you will find my recommendation. Thank you!]  So this game has been one of my favorite building games of all time. Starting in 2010 along with the majority of what I would say was our community, I bought the original Blockland and was having a great time. Things were getting done, updates being made. There were these classics maps I'll never forget: the Bedroom, the Kitchen, and the Slopes. I enjoyed this game, and I was estimated to be playing it about 10 hours a day or more. (Update: Many people don't believe I played this game as long as I claim. The truth is, Blockland existed before (its release on) Steam. For this reason, Steam has not registered all my hours from when I played it before. I only recently migrated to Steam Blockland from the original Vanilla Blockland. Hope that clears things up!)  It took some time but an insightful man by the name of Ephialtes in-game decided to build Blockland a new system. I believe it was around 2011-2012 that this became widely-used. It was called Return to Blockland, and was basically the Steam client for Blockland before Blockland was actually on Steam. It had a 'Workshop' (servers that hosted add-ons you could directly download from), Add-On Manager, Friends client, global IRC chat, chat rooms, easy-to-use settings system for your server, add-on preferences manager, and so much more. It was the true revelation of Blockland's existence. It brought upon a new experience for the Blockland community, and gave it a modern feel.   Then this game went on Greenlight.   That officially marked the downfall of RTB, which would eventually be shut down because Steam replaced 1/3 of its functionality. There would no longer be a place to manage your add-ons, chat globally with other BL users, find your friends (since they would no longer be on RTB and you didn't know if they had Steam), and last but not least, you could no longer manage your server like you used to.  That probably drove me away the most. I stuck around for a bit, hosted a multitude of mildly popular servers as well as a 32/32 player MERP server that consisted of most of my time. After about four months, I kinda lost interest and began the process of leaving the BL community. I left a legacy, but even that would soon be forgotten...  So you know that game called Minecraft? I ended up spending almost all of my time on that. I hosted some very popular servers on Minecraft, met some great friends, and was enjoying it. I almost forgot about Blockland completely, but then my friend (who shall remain nameless) decided to get Blockland after I showed him a fun little gamemode on it called Renderman. He got it, and when I saw that he did, I decided to hop back on and play with him... but I didn't do much otherwise.  I truly came back about two months ago. I began hosting my MERP server, probably just to feel the nostalgia and see all the empires that had been built on it. A friend of mine by the name of Amir (a full-time player of my server back when it was popular) happened to stop by. We had an awesome reunion, played a bit of MERP (not really. Just remarked on how sucky our builds were), had a lot of fun. I began playing Blockland much more.  And then I stopped. Garry's Mod took up my time. I managed a community on there and couldn't depart from them. But that wasn't the only reason.   I lost interest.   So anyways, if you got to the bottom of this review reading through an incredibly long backstory and wondering why the heck I'd write a story like that, I congratulate you. You have the patience of a... you, but none of this was really a review, was it?  So here's my take on the game.    If you want to play a game with a large amount of active community supporters/respectful, mature players, don't get this game.  If you want to play a game where you build anything and can do anything (with the help of a bit of programming knowledge or the visually-based event system), get this game.  If you want to play a game where servers are always full and there is an easy way to liven up your game with user-created add-ons, don't get this game.  If you want to play a game where you can host a server of any kind, have some fun with Pirate Ship DM gamemodes, and basically shoot your friends with laser pistols and horse rays (yeah, they turn them into a horse), this game IS FOR YOU.  BUT. If you want a game that will keep you interested for years to come, always ready for that next update, always ready for that next big thing... don't get this game. It's unkempt, uncombed, and unfathomably stagnate.  But I might be wrong. What if YOU are the next big thing?     In my opinion, this game is NOT recommended due to the lack of interesting things that may be found in Blockland.",

The final straw was the v21 update; all yall young whipper snappers don't know the pain from the death of the terrain. It was truly tragic for most players, we traded off brilliant 3d maps with hills and terrains for what? shaders that probably still totally suck, brick collisions with both vehicals and entities are garbage, kiling off some of the more popular servers. It's been a while since of played but I seriously doubt anything has changed.  If you do just like legos and building things, this is the game for you.  ----EDIT----  Since some ♥♥♥ hat couldnt interpret that I played the game before steam, given my .7 hours play time and the fact that I said I played while there was terrain, while also complimenting(?) my grammar, I just need to point out that I have put thousands of hours into this game, I started playing around june of 2011. dunno if ID's are still a thing, but look up 30927. the name SHOULD be TestZombie, unless one of my dumb-as-nails siblings changed it when i forgot to log off steam once.  ----EDIT----  Thinking about what this game used to be litterally gives me depression. It's like the original TEEN TITANS series compared to Teen Titans Go; except instead of TTG its actually just a 15 minute video of a dog Taking a ♥♥♥♥ then being hit by a train.  OH and what I edited to say was - apparently mods don't even exist for the game now that it has been green lit to steam, this was practiaclly Lego Gary's Mod except 100x better than the 2 of them combined, so the terrain death update shortly followed by Steam destroyed the very small glimmer of hope that could possibly have still existed for this game. Honestly, I think the game is false advertising when it uses Tenski's Blockland trailer which exclusevly showed mods made by the comunity.  Also I don't know where, but I heard a rumor fairly recently that RTB (a beautiful mod, the mother of all mods, a mod that allowed players to have Friends (obviously this part deppreciated by steam) and also group chats and a beautifull IRC with several mods and bots at all times, it was a mod and (before that solely) a website that allowed people to create and share mods to be downloaded easily in game or manually; I heard that it may be coming back, it's not enough to save; scratch that, resurect this game, but with dedication that I don't believe exists anymore,",

Look on the game's official forum for proof. There is literally an ENITRE THREAD DEDICATED TOWARDS FLAMING OTHER USERS!!! Not only that, but you have many, many people (Kids and adults) that do NOT act thier age whatsoever. And with a large portion of the community having mental illnesses such as Autism, it can be very annoying at most times. (Im not saying people with a legitimate mental illness are bad, but they can be annoying without even knowing it)  Now, there is some good with this game. The user-created content back from around 2010 still remains extremely popular today, and builds, bricks, weapons, and tools still remain extremely fun to mess around with today, in the game's single player. There are even brick add-ons that add even more actual LEGO blocks to the game!  However, in conclusion, your $10 dollars would be MUCH better spent on a different game, perhaps one of the older GTA games? Or maybe a few case keys in CSGO?  Or, best of all, you could take the $10 you were going to use on virtual Legos and go out to any old toy store and buy yourself some REAL Legos!  It'd pry be more fun than this game anyways... ",

I wish I could say the same about the community. The community in Blockland is utter garbage. Half the players barely speak English, they abuse their admin powers to make your time on their server's a living hell, and they are just generally no fun to play with.  The other half is full of players who think they're the best. They see you as worthless and see themselves as amazing players who are always right. They won't take any criticism; you try to help their server improve and after a message that you can't understand because the guy you're arguing to has the worst grammar in the universe, they ban you.  These players also are constantly trying to find interesting and 'cool' ways to completely destroy your stuff. To them, the gamemode 'Freebuild' revolves around breaking things and causing players to waste minutes or even hours building a fantastic building which is just destroyed. Sometimes they'll send out trust invites, and if you don't accept them, they will perma-ban you regardless of the server being called 'No kicks/bans' (Yes, I'm looking at you Va11jr AJ)  Most of these players are also under the age of 8, or at least they act like it. Sometimes the stupidity of these players makes you wonder if they're just stupid people or actually monkeys trained to play games. Only a small handful of these players are great people, who host great servers with a great experience.  Fantastic game to play with friends or on Single Player, but if you're looking for a fantastic multiplayer experience, I'd suggest going elsewhere.",

It sincerely rewards talent and planning as to there isn't really a matter of rote time spent building but in how it is built. This isn't just like the best minecraft creations which are...just large, but how the design is implemented. As far as the community??...mostly young children, of elementary age, always has been, always will be.   The problem is the game has lost its appeal to those older people who were contributing it its isolated and beautiful pre-steam 'RTB' development. A comprehensive add-on manager with community updates turned this into one of PC gaming's best kept creative secrets, just like Battlefield 2's Sandbox mod and the original Garry's Mod. But like all great things, it must come to an end. (Christ I'm not even 18 yet and I've seen countless communities die out, makes me feel like an old man) The steam transfer was relatively flawless, but avid players looked on with mostly hype among a few skeptics, me one of them who feared the worse. It didn't come eventually but the RTB admins stopped developing, and the whole project folded. Communities who tried to stick together became separated into cliques of steam friends, with their own pathos and memes wanting ♥♥♥♥-all to do with anybody else.  This is a game where my City server, under the name Anonymousca4 took around a year in 2012 to come out with any real results, and to be honest, simply wonderful, it was like that city of lego I had in my basement as a child but with no fear it would need to be cleaned up. The community had its trolls, which were only really seeking some thrills, and its children, which after some coddling didn't ruin the mood. It was all good then, add-ons were inspired and modular, meaning along with a good brick-builder you could mimic or even produce any game mode or setting imaginable, making this a sort of macro-game among its users, as in this was about the only game they actively played. Community involvement and even drama felt inclusive, hard to avoid which resulted in some great times like Blockoworld 2011, a god damn in-game convention showcasing different servers, players and talents.   Can it be a fantastic game? I'd be one of the first to tell you so, but can I recommend it without a proper source of new content and a fractured playerbase. Got some friends looking for a lan game or party game, then there should still be hope, but as far as a multiplayer game it has lost its charm that provided me with some great moments in middle school.",

It is almost like legos, but it is very slow and from my opinion I hate it and wish I did not spend the money on it so don`t make the same mistake I did in getting this game!",

It's similiar to GMOD, but is more about building, different server types, different mechanics, item types, and overall different community style.  But overall, I have so much fun with this game, and the hundreds of hours you can get from such a cheap game is astounding. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Time to change it up a bit now. No, I do not recommend this game anymore. The charm has been lost, as the community has been exhausted and has no motivation to make any good servers. Any good servers have been lost, due to people just no longer wanting to play the game and not caring anymore. This causes random non dedicated servers to rise to the top of the server list because no one has anything else to play. Now, maybe this would be fine, but these servers were not intended to be of amazing quality, but just to play with a few friends.  And guess why? No big new updates. It's a chain reaction from famous and well respected people leaving due to pure boredom. Now, if Badspot had said he would no longer update the game, I, and maybe others, would've been okay with it. But nope, for two years he made no worthwhile updates and everyone asked him why. However, when people did, he would lose his mind and swear and yell at people who dared to ask. And than one day he just said he was no longer motivated and did not want to satisfy 'shrieking children.' Well, if you updated the game in the mean time, maybe they would not have been 'shrieking' as you say.  Even if they maturely gave their opinions, he would ban them. He just did not care. He does not care for the game, and it's dying because of it. Do not buy the game, and do not support Badspot.",

The game's community was a cesspool of silliness and chaos. And it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ perfect. Now it's full of memes and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Undertale/FNaF RPs and shameless minigames. No freebuilds worth going to. Absolutely nothing interesting.   I mean sure, it's nice to go back every once in a while, but that once in a while thing is going to go away pretty soon. Blockland was a game I enjoyed for almost half of my life, now it is reduced to a forgotten reflection of ages long past.   I can no longer recommend this game, sadly. It's not worth shoving $10 into Steam to play a game that has long since faded into obscurity.",
