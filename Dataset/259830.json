            "review_text": "Wooden Sen'sey is action-platforming game where you play as a Japanese village chief who's sake is stolen by evil, space bandits, and its up to you to get all that wonderful rice-liquor back. The moral of the story is pretty straight-forward, never steal a Japanese-man's sake, but especially if that same man is going to hunt your ♥♥♥ down Kratos-style with his twin, chain-linked axes to boot!  Graphics  For a simple platforming game, I gotta say, I'm impressed. The visual over the top style of the animations mixed with the seren background imagery gives Wooden Sen'sey a real reason to stand out . With a varitey of resolution options and graphic presets the game give you just enough in options to really optimize you game experience, and Even on low settings this game looks pretty good. My littlefavorite touch was simply the reflections on the water. Its subtle touch but nice one that adds a little life to the background.   Audio   All in all the music was pleasant to listen to and didn't feel out of place which I applaud upper byte for, considering that the game is a mix of Japanese tradionism and steampunk. Though the dialogue wasn't much of anything, I found the over the top japanese acent to be rather humorous, much in the same way a funny character in a kaboki theater play would exaggerate his voice. Reminding you that the game is meant to be funny and fun, even though you will probably die. a lot.  ",

            "review_text": "The game tries, but it fails to take it home.  The mechanics (short-ranged combat, swinging with rope-axes, bouncing and platforming) are certainly nothing new, but I did enjoy the mix, it felt good. The controls are not very precise in some aspects, but they're bearable. Art direction is nothing to write home about either, but it works.  Then, you start noticing little bugs, like hit detection on enemies or hit detection on your rope swings. Then, you start noticing little balancing issues, like ranged enemies that have a high enough fire rate to keep you at bay with knockback and kill you unless you glitch it, or rows of 8+ scarcely dangerous enemies inserted as padding right after a checkpoint. They also begin almost every difficult section with an extra life, showing they have no faith in either the audience or their platforming balancing.  And then, the final boss. The final boss made me throw the towel. Remember all those tactics you learned through the game? Learn how the enemies move and take them out with your axes... Carefully swing around to get that one item so you can get back to 4 health... Explore the environment looking for secret areas... Good, now forget it. The final boss is nothing like that. The final boss is a runner with no checkpoints and riddled with insta-kill traps. A section like this (which closely resembles Bit Trip Runner with its timing nature) requires tight controls, something that this game doesn't have, and it especially shows in this final stage. First, you have 10-15 seconds of running, which is padding. Then you have three sawblades on the floor, as wide as your longest jump, so you have to time it perfectly, and I mean 1-2 frame perfect. You can boost-jump through 2 of these but not all 3, because otherwise you'll be too slow before the boss catches up to you. Then you have some precision jumping (with insta-kill blades in-between), some precision swings (with death void below), and then god knows what because I gave up after the rope didn't hook to the ceiling for the Nth time even though it should've. What makes it worse is that you have 4 lives and no extra ones can be found in the level (as far as I could manage to last). This means you get a 15 second cutscene after loading the level, then you can die 4 times; when you do (and you will), you're forced to wait about 10 seconds (loading + death screen), then another 15 seconds for the boss cutscene.  Had it been for the early 8 stages I would've suggested this. Nothing exceptional, but it would've worked ok. The last boss changed the experience from an unremarkable decent one to a memorably annoying waste of time.  Yes, I'll remember you, Wooden Sen'SeY. Good job.",

It's kind of a hack-n-slash action platformer, with some precision platforming thrown in for good measure. Enemies start getting badass, though early on you're wondering what damage can they do. It is by no means easy, nor difficult. Lots of stuff to collect, so you can easily play levels again as well.  The really good part is the graphics/visuals. The water reflections? Oh my...amazing. Soundtrack is not too bad too.   In the end, this is kinda like an 'easy to love' action platformer.",
