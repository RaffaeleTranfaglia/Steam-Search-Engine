My only decision is just how much I want to reward the developer. Will absolutely be donating if for no other reason than the art.  I saw another review that compared this to Persona's social aspects and I agree. I always loved P3&amp;4 social aspects and this game has plenty of it.  It isn't a perfect game, but the issues I have are mere details so far (pressing the same button for the text to advance and to make decisions sometimes makes you select something before you even knew it was there).  Great job, good game.",
