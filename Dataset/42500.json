            "review_text": "I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.   One Hour Reviews #49 - DogFighter  Exactly as you'd expect from the title, DogFighter pits you as a fighter pilot against a number of other pilots. It's pretty much deathmatch with propellar planes, which isn't itself a bad thing.  I started with the tutorial, which does a perfectly good job taking you through the various controls in the game. The left stick controls the plane, while the right stick is used for performing different maneuvers, which include barrel rolls in either direction, a loop, and an Immelmann turn.  Much like a typical deathmatch game, you pick up powerups, which can provide both offensive and defensive capabilities. Offensive items are activated with the right trigger, and defensive items are activated with the left trigger.  The flight model is completely arcade-like, so anyone expecting simulator level realism should look elsewhere. But, on the flip side, the game is very easy to pick up.  The game offers some different game modes, but they don't really change the core gameplay which is to fly your plane, shoot other plans, and don't get shot down. All of the game modes are just variations of the basic deathmatch.  Which brings me to the problem I had with this game. You can't really have a deathmatch game without other people playing it. And nobody seems to be playing this anymore. Granted, this game came out back in 2010, but sadly it seems the shelf life of this game was pretty short, and people have moved on. So, unless you fancy playing deathmatch with a bunch of bots, you are better off looking at other games. ",

I haven't had the issues previously mentioned, but some of my friends ran into problems because they accidentally set their resolution to an unsupported refresh rate.
