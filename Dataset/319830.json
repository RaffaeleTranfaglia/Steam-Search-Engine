            "review_text": "Well this is really more someone mucking around with a 3D gaming engine than an actual game.  It's a lot better than the tired old 2D retro pixel platformers that people with no talent push out just because they think if they release a game pretending 30 years of advancement in video gaming hasn't taken place, they can quit their job at Starbucks. This is more of the foundation for a real game that isn't there yet.  A lot of effort went into making this game work and it shows. The visuals in the engine look nice. There's no sense of 'laziness' that you get from other games, rather the feeling that it's an incomplete project.  Unfortunately as far as games go, it's not a huge amount of fun, you have some 'morphing' advanced fighter plane that can change shape and turn into a submarine, there's 10 mediocre missions where you shoot uninspired enemies and the game engine gets shown off a lot.   It's a good tech demo but not a game you should buy expecting to get Wing Commander or a decent flight sim or anything.",
