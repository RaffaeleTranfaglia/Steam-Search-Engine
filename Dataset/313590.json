            "review_text": "Boo Bunny Plague is a....... . . ... .. .. ?!?!?!?!!?!?!?  Wait. What the crap did I just play? BBP is a musical action-adventure where you play as an idiot robo-rabbit. He's the non-sequitor type so sometimes you have to leave the review in the microwave for a couple minutes so it can cool. He has a few friends but they're as useless as PEAS AND CARROTS. Seriously though I'm going to break it down. This is a short game (I consider this a plus) and you'll spend most of it fighting bosses and questioning reality.  I'll give points for getting the humor right. For the most part it's good-natured, and I even got a few laughs out of it. Even when the jokes miss I'm usually in a state of shock thinking 'What? Did they do that? Are they really doing this? whAT?' so I just sorta gloss over them. BBP also has a really good soundtrack, which I suppose is expected considering that this game classifies itself as a musical.   And then there's the game-play...hmm. As I said, this game is mostly boss-fights, and they aren't too bad. I wouldn't put them at the level of Platinum (the developer), I probably wouldn't even put them at the level of U.S. Gold (remember those guys?) The boss-fights are sloppy, suffer from weak mechanics, and yet they aren't too bad. They're certainly functional, and this game deserves kudos for putting forth the effort to make every boss different. Some bosses even require different strategies, which is not something you see everyday. Also there's an incentive to finding every guitar, as bosses tend to be weak to their special effects. The rest of the game is spent killing vikings, there is a platforming section, and don't forget the part where you dodge rocks while crossing a rainbow.   Did I mention this game is short? Short games are underrated these days. I probably could have beaten this game in under 2 hours if I didn't want to kill so many vikings (hate those nerds). You can play through this game, get 90% of the achievements in a single run, and even if all you remember about it is: 'Things happened and then I saw some credits', it's still probably better than grinding out another experience level in some J-RPG or eliminating all of those crazy Russians that have infiltrated your base for the 1,356,742th time.  All that said, don't drop whatever you're playing just to shoot through this game. Objectively* speaking, Boo Bunny Plague is not a good game. It has heart &amp; spunk though, and sometimes you just gotta have a little of both. If you ever find yourself undecided on what to play next. If you're wondering whether you should play Shadow of Mordor, or Bayonetta 2, or Civilization: Beyond Earth. This is the perfect time to play Boo Bunny Plague. Don't try to make sense of this decision, just roll with it.  *Yes I totally just used the O word in a review. OH WELL.",

Somehow the 4 horsemen get involved. Hilarity ensues. Cue epic boss music. ( It's some of the best boss music I've ever heard, it makes the deluxe edition worth it.)",

This game is awful but it's also hilarious. It's so rare for me to be perfectly ok with mediocre gameplay just to keep hearing more dialogue.   Boo Bunny or just Bunny or...I'm honestly not sure, I don't recall a NAME being said...is born when a disgruntled employee in a robot bunny factory uploads a virus thing and you spring to life as a crazy person with a guitar, which you use to beat on things. There isn't really much in the way of a combo system, and you are fairly fragile, but you can block with a recharging shield that doesn't really work great either. You're saved from a robot t-rex by Gunny, a robot that may be just made entirely out of guns...and you're the best of friends from the start. There's a story from that point on, but it's sort of....confusing....but still funny. You fight Thor, founding member of the Village People. Some other things happen. Whichever.  I bought this game for everyone on my friends list during the sale going on at the time (50% off) and I probably would have done the same at full price. 2 bucks for a couple hours of laughs is a bargain any day of the week.",

But, I came to really like the screwball world that it presented. Where robots hire a toy to kill a god. Where an elephant god works as a taxi driver and The Devil's daughter works as a waitress in a trans-temporal diner. I just played it to see the next crazy thing Bunny would do/fight. It also helps that the game is so brief, it dosen't overstay its welcome.   If you do get it, shell out another buck for the deluxe edition. The soundtrack is well-made, creative and worth the price.  In the end, if you want something short and simple with some creative story ideas and a solid sountrack, pick this up. 3/5 (generous score)",

The music's great, it a video game musical. The dialogue in this game is fun and humorous. The acting in this game is on par with some of the best I have heard. The story's great, I'm not gonna spoil it for you. The physics are of old school games such as Earth Worm Jim. Killing god with a guitar (axe) was a good one.  This game is just all around fun, everything about this game it great. 9.5/10 Sadly its a little short. Hopefully there's a sequel.",
