            "review_text": "This game series is better known as EEP - Eisenbahn.exe Professional. I know the EEP series from the very beginning and Railroad X is another of its development. First of all, it's a simulation of model railway, not real trains. If you want train simulator, buy Train Simulator or eventually Trainz.  Railroad X (EEP 10) is for everyone who did not have enough space at home to build their own railroad model. It is more an application than a game. This allows you to build very complex automatically controlled railroad systems, imagination is the only limit. You can control not only trains - also road, water and even air traffic. I must admit that the editor is complicated (so many options which you don't know at the beginning) and requires patience but once it is mastered, it works instinctively. The only thing that is awful, is a camera control in free view - never, from the very beginning, it has not been fixed... If you want to become better acquainted with Railroad X, you need to book yourself plenty of time... Building even a simple model takes a long time, if you want it to look really nice. To compare your abilities, there are a few finished models with EEP. If you like to build a railway models and maps, have a lot of free time and patience, Railroad X is created for you.",
