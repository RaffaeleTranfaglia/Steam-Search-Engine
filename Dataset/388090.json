            "review_text": "'OH NO A NEGATIVE REVIEW! MUST BE A TROLL RIGHT?'   No.  Don't get me wrong, Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is quite the interesting game, it serves a pretty haunting and deep storyline, along with an interesting concept of a game. However, this game certainly is not THAT good, I don't think it's very deserving of the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews out there.  So, you play as the victim from the infamous bite of 87, which is quite a nice twist in the storyline. Haunted over the event, the child begins to fear these animatronics, and pictures them as these freakish monster creatures. I wont dive to in depth with the story, this is for you to figure out yourself.   I think Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is a great achievement as well, considering it was made in Clickteam Fusion, however the engine the game uses is actually a major flaw... You see, I personally think gameplay over graphics, however, considering this game's visuals aren't all too stunning, the animation quality can sometimes seem un-natural, and the game's only control is to click on doors and hold down a few keys every now shows that this game lacks both gameplay and graphics. People are going to begin to say 'DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR A GAME TO BE POINT AND CLICK!?' which I do know, I just don't think it really works out. You see, when you're trying to make a horror game that's meant to be immersive and meant to be creepy, you'd think you would get a little more out of it.   Another thing I didn't really like is that the game... isn't scary... Yeah, you probably think I'm just trying to make myself look brave and all, but I'm not. Even when PewDiePie played the game, he never flinched. That guy overreacts to everything, and the fact that he doesn't to this game probably says something. Sure, you may find it scary, but personally, I don't, and I know a hand full of people who agree with me.   Pros: - Interesting concept - Intriguing story-line - A nice twist to the series  Cons: - Lacks gameplay - Lacks immersive visuals - Relies too heavily on jump-scares to be scary - Animation quality is pretty bad - Serves very little hours of gameplay (if this is what you call gameplay)   If you are expecting a rating out of me, I would personally say it's a 5/10, I understand other people may actually enjoy this game, and that's great for you if you do, however I didn't find much out of it. Also, a 5 isn't THAT bad. It's a mediocre game, that's all.    Also, just throwing this out, this doesn't change my perspective on the game, but I think it's something that should be made clear. This game's fanbase if awful, possibly one of the worse fandoms out there. It's filled with false hype, over-saturation, and childish behavior. In fact, I bet I will get a comment telling me how wrong I am, by someone who can't prove even prove me wrong.   Lastly, this isn't self advertisement, in fact I find this to be shameful on myself. I noticed this review is getting more and more traffic very fast and therefor it's bound for someone to recognize me. Yes, I am that guy who made the 'How to animate FNAF in SFM tutorial' along with a handful of other FNAF videos. I regret it at moments, and don't animate anything Five Nights at Freddy's unless it's like super requested that I do one video in particular. A FNAF video that started off as a joke quickly escalated into more request overtime. I don't mind making them, just as long as I can take a short break and make a 'whatever video' or something, which I do. Call me a hypocrite, however, I never once said I liked FNAF in the past.'",

            "review_text": "Am I gonna say what I think of the game? Yes, I liked it. Though, it was the story that was the best part. Gameplay is hard to grasp as the 'breathing' is hard to identify.  7/10  Now to tell people why this game doesn't take place in 1987. 'Of course, your gonna use the commercial argument!' Actually, no. Even before I discovered that commercial, I knew that there were story elements from other games that prevent this game from taking place in 1987. Here are the facts. (spoilers for all games ahead)  First, it's to note that it never says in-game when the game takes place. People assume 1987 because an animatronic bites a child. As such, don't assume 1987 automatically. Secondly, we need to know the timeline of the restaurants. FNAF4 comes first during Fredbear's Family Diner, second is the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria (which no game has taken place), third is the 2nd Pizzaria in FNAF2, fourth is the 3rd Pizzaria in FNAF1, and lastly Fazbear's Fright in FNAF3. The only game with a confirmed date is FNAF2, which is in 1987. So, if FNAF4 is also in 1987, then there would be three different restaurants existing in one year, which is ridiculous. And remember, the 2nd Pizzaria was only open for 2 weeks. But, we are here for hard evidence, not an argument against something ridiculous.  1. Passage of Time On Night 5 of FNAF2, Phone Guy says   'Uh, I think the name of the original restaurant was... 'Fredbear's Family Diner' or something like that. It's been closed for years though, I doubt we'll be able to track anyone down.'   So, Fredbear's Family Diner had been closed for YEARS before FNAF2, making it impossible for it to be in 1987.  2. Moving Animatronics  The first message we ever get says   'Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?'   So, after the Bite, the animatronics weren't allowed to move around. So, if the Bite of 87 was at Fredbear's Diner, then the animatronics shouldn't be able to move around afterwards, right? Well, not according to Phone Guy on Night 1 of FNAF2.   'They've spent a small fortune on these new animatronics, uh, facial recognition, advanced mobility, they even let them walk around during the day. Isn't that neat?'   Even so, in the Foxy minigame (which takes place at the 1st Pizzaria, since Pirate's Cove doesn't look like the one in FNAF1) it shows Foxy being able to move around during shows as he is running on stage. And when you think about it, it's ridiculous to blame the Bite on Fredbear in FNAF4 when it wasn't even his fault. The 4th game shows a bunch of teens putting a little kid inside Fredbear's mouth, making it their fault, not Fredbear's. Plus, Fredbear wasn't even moving around.   3. Position of the Child   Look at the bite in FNAF4. It doesn't look like his frontal lobe is being bitten off. The child's position makes it seem that his head is being crushed, not just his frontal lobe.  4. What Happens To Dreams  The Game Theorist made a point proving that, scientifically, if someone loses their frontal lobe, they wouldn't even have nightmares. They would instead have happy dreams.  There you go. I didn't even have to use the commercial to prove it. The only reason people look to the 1983 in the commercial for the date is because it's the only date ever shown that makes sense, not because it's randomly there. So, hopefully this taught you information you didn't know.  I will also answer any questions you guys have.  Edit:  So, there is confusion on whether or not FNAF4 takes place at Fredbear's or Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.   The FNAF3 minigame (which is confirmed to be the first, thanks to Phone Guy) is NOT the one we see in FNAF4. While similar in design, look at the hat of the bear. The minigame's hat is brown and Fredbear's hat is purple.   Secondly, the main antagonist of FNAF4 is Fredbear, which puts him as the most important.   Lastly, poromotion everywhere for the restaurant refers to Fredbear, NOT Freddy. Why else would the commercial say 'FREDBEAR and Friends'?",

            "review_text": "Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is the final chapter in the Five Nights at Freddy's series, together with being the last game, it's also the scariest game in the series as well. The game is COMPLETELY different in the gameplay than all of the previous games, you don't have a security camera anymore, all you have to defend yourself is a flashlight, to scare the animatronics away. The gameplay is made in such a way, that you need to focus on the audio cues, making you to concentrate on the game carefully, making you feel like you're a part of it all.  The animations in this game are amazing, everything is now completely fluid, and doesn't feel like they're 'laggy' at all. The graphics and everything are amazing too, it looks like Scott Cawthon put all of his effort into this game. Now, I'll explain why it is so scary, it's pretty simple. You're a kid, having to defend yourself against the Nightmare Animatronics, in order to do so, you need to move next to the doors, and listen carefully if there are breathing sounds, if there are breathing sounds, you need to shut down the door, and wait 'till you hear footsteps. But you never know if you're safe. If you succesfully defended yourself, or not. The next time you flash the light, might be the time of your death. And during the time you have to shut down the door. If you succesfully defend yourself, you still cannot think calmly. You're still worried an animatronic can come from the door, or the bed, or even the closet. You have to constatly defend yourself, while being scared of the animatronics. The game is also very good at causing surprise attacks. Things like Foxy's 'Failed Jumpscare' is something which makes the game feel a lot more lively, and great. There are also a few nights where you suddenly have to change your strategy, due to something new coming up, making you have a lot of more fright due to the fact of not knowing what to do, due to the extremely creepy looks of the animatronics. The game also has some small things which made the first game very good, like random, creepy sounds, like Freddy's laugh, dogs barking, and such. The game also reveals another part of the FNaF story, which is quite sad.  Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is an amazing horror game, which brings together the scariest parts of all the games, turning it into a game with brand new gameplay, creepy animatronics, and everything you need in a good horror game. I recommend Five Nights at Freddy's 4 greatly, if you did not like the previous games, I would recommend you to pick this one up, as this one will very likely scare the heck outta you.",

It abandoned the camera system which is good since you've always ignored most of the cams in the late game anyway. I'm very satisfied with the way it is now. This time it really has you in constant fear. You can't immediately check for lurking threats. You have to wait and listen for ominous thunder-like breaths or else you fall victim to your own impatience. My favorite new thing is that it has some sort of final boss, an extra menacing monstrosity, which will undoubtedly haunt your dreams. It's not too hard either   unlike the 3rd game   and is quite managable. Although it has weird performance issues when loading the screens at the start of any night, it doesn't affect the gameplay enough to make you upset. I heavily recommend this game to anyone who's even slightly interested. 10/10",

Five Nights at Freddys 4 takes place inside a house then in a establishment. This is my favorite game out of the four because it builds up more suspense for the player. Also this game has no cameras or monitors, instead you only have a flashlight to keep you protected. It also has lots of modes that allow you to change the settings of the night, for example you can make the characters harder by setting their difficulty by 1-20, or you can see when they are coming. In my opinion, this is a very nice game. I think it is worth playing and trying out.",

Another thing is after the crying child die remeber the last lines ' I will put you back together' well its no Plush freddbear talking because the font is a diffrent COLOR! so how is talking well non another than the PUPPET.

When I first got this game it was huge mess mainly in the fact the audio seemed too quiet especially for a game where audio was main mechanic. It felt like like the audio is quiet just so people would have to turn up their audio to get scared by the jumpscares, so I stopped playing untill it was fixed. Finally when he fix the game mainly the audio its still felt messy to play especially since how it still hard to hear the 'breathing mechanic' was still to hard to hear over the ambiance sounds that was louder than the mechanic it's self. Anyway I felt like the reason I bought this game was because I wanted to finish the series on my steam game list because I really enjoyed the first game a lot but then it felt like past the second one that this series was rushed way to much. Is it worth it? No not really unless you get on sale, but I recomend the first over the this one mainly because this one really felt like a interactive screamer than the first one.

The halloween mode is harder and almost all the characters replaced has ways to distract you (Static-Laughs-Music Box) The new characters (except for Nightmarrione and Nightmare BB) however are just reskins of the original counter parts. (Jack-o-Bonnie/ Chica and Nightmare Mangle having the same head as Nightmare Foxy.) -Imporvments The game could have more original designs (NIghtmare Rat from FNAC 3 is a good example). - The game story could be explained in a simpler way Other than that, would recommend.",

Still to be completed, but night 5 isn't a walk in the park right now!  The only thing I'm not enjoying about this game so far is that there's two extremes to the volumes: On the one hand you're raising your awareness for this supposed 'breathing' noise I can't seem to make out, and on the other, said risen awareness plus extremely loud jumpscare equals a really bad headache.   As the game stands right now, it's pretty awesome, I'm impressed with this one, and is well on the way to being the best in the series - the graphics are awesome, the concept is awesome, everything about the look and feel of the game so far is awesome, but the flashlight sticks sometimes which sucks, and I'm not willing to risk my hearing just so I can deficate myself. If the other aspects of the game are good enough, you don't need loud noises to scare people - If you want that, I suggest any horror story mod on Garry's Mod.",

Why, Because instead of being a Night Guard in an Office, Your are a little child in a bedroom(Which looks almost like the office in the First game wich I like). And of course, I sleep in a Bedroom. That's what is so scary about it. The footsteps are very spooky and send shivers down my spine everytime. And I like that. The Junpscares are great. They get me every time and the noise they make is awful. Which I like as well. There are also some secret Monsters in the game. But most of you probably already know what they are.

            "review_text": "The tensest moment in Five Nights at Freddy s 4 is a one-second lean. I m leaning out of a child s bedroom, a sharp departure from the Formica wasteland of Freddy Fazbear s pizzeria, peering down a hallway swallowed in darkness. I may as well be staring into a lion s mouth. When I risk a glance out one of the two flanking doors into the dark corridors beyond, my perspective skews unnervingly. I can imagine my hands hugging the wall, an ostensible anchor against the nightmares bumping in the blackness.  Nothing jumps out at me this time. The moment passes, and it's back to the same movements and mouse-clicks I ve repeated dozens of times before. I should ve yawned five minutes ago, but soon I m once more forcing my heart back down my throat for my next peek outside. This repeats for quite some minutes. If FNAF 4 needed a box blurb, it d read something like a rollercoaster of apprehension.  FNAF 4 s composition is another rivet in the series steel-clad design which immortalized its Let s Play legacy in a few short months: five 8-minute nights of staying put in a room while fending off a quick death (and a nasty jumpscare) from creepy, walking animatronic animals using careful surveillance and snappily blocking access to whatever shuffles close. Loud screeches and terrifying robotic visages are common, so a strong resolve helps. Mostly.  Boy meets demon Above anything, developer Scott Cawthon s tenacity at constantly tweaking his formula for horror is almost Kubrickian in its meticulousness. FNAF 4 s fundamentals stay firmly acquainted—a familiarly symmetrical room; the reprise of Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy as primary antagonists; the usage of doors as a primary defensive mechanic—but its differences offer a refreshing new presentation of the risk-reward seesaw of its predecessors.  Replacing the ever-troubled pizzeria from previous games is the nighttime bedroom of a kid who both substitutes for the hilariously underpaid security guard as the main character and clearly establishes his traumatic phobia of Freddy s friends with a constant Binding-of-Isaac-esque flow of tears. In a flagrant flouting of the status quo, the camera system is removed entirely. Checking for an impending attack involves running up to a door, leaning out, and clicking on a flashlight (thankfully with unlimited battery power) or slamming the door shut at the precise moment I anticipate something lunging for me.  As before, staying alive demands familiarization with each animatronic s behavior. Where sight and constant camera tracking facilitated this in earlier games, FNAF 4 tosses that away for a different angle: sound. Audio cues—muffled footsteps, the metallic tinkling of shifting kitchen pans, a huff of breath from something Right Beside You—indicate when to use the flashlight or seal a doorway. Being proactive is essential; a single mistake invariably delivers a booming fright. I liked that avoidance of randomness in failure, as my actions and choices solely contributed to whether or not I d soon jump out of my chair.  And that s really what Cawthon is best at: ensuring crystallized snapshots of stomach-dropping terror. FNAF 4 uses the sensitivity of your senses to prod out a panicked yelp every time. Does it work? Absolutely. It s absurdly rudimentary: straining to hear something barely above a whisper connects into a skull-shaking blast of sound and a horrible monster face stretched across the monitor. Of course it works.  A minigame involving a plushified version of Springtrap can shave two hours off each night. But it s a bit worrisome to see an overall pivot away from what made the series so attractive in favor of a single, static mechanical loop across all five nights. The camera system, although imperfect—as later nights grew more difficult, staring too long at the video screen likely meant death—greatly defined the series identity. In FNAF 2, checking vents and winding the music box were integral counterparts to the cameras. FNAF 3 piled on the sinister inevitability of tracking a stalking killer.  In many ways, the Five Nights games require a certain respect for their atmospheric lore, a twisted menagerie of cloudy dates, murder mysteries, and inter-relationships nearly as spaghettified as a Metal Gear Solid cutscene. Stepping into Freddy s world, like flipping open a King novel or tuning into a Carpenter classic, is an investment in putting aside disbelief and reveling in the supernatural guesswork of the genre. That s sadly tougher to pull off in Five Nights at Freddy s 4; the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over—door, listen, flashlight, repeat—is too much of a chore to fully pull me in. It s certainly the scariest of the four, but the subtle uneasiness and self-doubt so tellingly accomplished in its older brothers is diminished.",

FNAF 4 is almost the exact same thing. It's boring and while the jumpsacres are unexcpected and kind of scary, it's not very eerie which I like in horror games. I'll tell you what. This is NOT how you make a horror game. Yes the lore is interesting but really? Who needed 4 F******* GAMES!? I sure didn't need 4 games. You need atmosphere and eerie sounds. Not scary animatronics and jumpscares. Jumpscares help but I need some eerie sounds to help set the atmosphere. Whih makes it scary. I don't reccomend this game. That's why.",

What was that?! oh crap, i think this is where stuff happens! *goes to door and flashes light and bonnie jumpscares* CRAAAA- *holds face and moans* What happened?! *takes a break and looks at scotts breathing news* Oh so i have to wait and listen ok *restarts night* Ok so unlike the previous games, i have to take time to listen before flashing the light *4 AM comes* im doing good, bonnie or chica has not showed up yet *goes to chica side and hears breathing* O_O *closes door and heart is thumping* GO AWAY CHICA!!! *does not hear breathing anymore* is she gone? *flashes light* yes is worked *6 AM comes* YES!!!

I think i met your father on FNAF 3! *turns light off and lets plushtrap run around* I HEAR RUNNING!!! *turns light on and sees plushtrap with an EXTREMLY CREEPY FACE* AH!

Don't kill m- *Get jumpscared by plushtrap* AAAAAWHATINTHEWORLDCRAAAA- *holds faces and moans again* 'Too bad' SHUT UP GAME!!! *presses ESC button and feels heart thumping hard* ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK!!!  My review: Ok This game might be just the scariest game in the whole series. Not just because of the jumpscares but the feel of where you are. Kids get scared of sleeping in their dark room because of monsters but there aren't any monsters but on this game, THERE IS! This game has good jumpscares, good sounds, and hopefully a good story, i don't understand the story yet, like a child trapped in his room i don't get it.  But overall Scott did a good job on this one. I recommend this game to those who want a heart attack. And thanks for reading my journey and my review! 10/10 would get a heart attack again! :D",

The elements it brings make it give the same feelings as the first one, what is interesting is that YOU are your own enemy. The idea of being scared and letting yourself be worried makes this game what it is today. Elements from the original game were put in but in a new way which makes it interesting and even scarier, and the jumpscares litterly made me jump from my chair. I defently reccomend this game to whoever is brave enough to buy this and play it through. What makes this game shine mostly is the story, you learn so much from playing it and of course experiencing everything for the first time. There is a reason Scott Cawthon hid ' Nightmare' all over his teaser images....because it truly is a nightmare when you experience everything in its full and scariest moments. In conclusion, its beyond an amazing game, this series is the scariest game series ive ever played in my whole life and i really wish this could continue. Go play it!!! But remember, getting scared has its fun moments too ;)",

The fact that you need HEADPHONES and a patch just to play the game properly REALLY bugs me. Not to mention, if you take a good look at how the game works, ITS ALMOST EXACTLY FNAF 1! You go to the doors to stop Bonnie and Chica, Foxy hides in your closet and you check on him frequently to keep him from attacking. The only different stuff is you have no cameras and nightmare freddy works alot differently.  As for the story, it is AGAIN given to us for interpretation. This was...honestly the lamest explanation for story ever. We were not given the identity of the purple guy, The only thing we learned about was a deus ex NOPE called the Bite of '83, stopping us from learning about the bite of '87. This game is just all kinds of dissapointing. Why scott. just why?  Pros +It actually ♥♥♥♥ing scared me. like once, though. +Looks quite good! Cons -Too. ♥♥♥♥ing.

            "review_text": "The horror aspect of FNaF 4 was actually pretty good. The suspense when listening for Freddy and co. was brillianty thought out and the sounds wear surprisingly good. The only problem with this game was replayability. I've talked about this in my other FNaF reviews and I'll say it again. FNaF 1,3 and 4 lack replayability. Especially 4. This game got so repetitive it made FNaF 1 look like the Binding of Isaac. It took me weeks to complete it, not because it was difficult, but because I found myself literally pressing ESC after 2 minutes of gameplay. If we took the replayability/challenge of FNaF 2 and the sounds/suspense of FNaF 4 we would have a great game. Alas that's not the case. Don't get this game. Just don't.  Recently the halloween update came out and, although I won't change the earlier part of this review, I felt obligated to play it and write an extra bit to my review, so here it is: The halloween update introduced a few new aspects and really weird character designs. It also came with new cheats to play around with and some surprisingly difficult and unique challenges (SHOCK! HORROR!) This felt like an attempt to up the game's replayability level, and, to my surprise it (kind of) worked. The appearance of the Mangle really ups the challenge and makes it almost a tolerable game. It's little changes like this that really make a difference. Kudos to you, Scott.  Although I still don't recommend it, I will give it a slighty increased rating, simply for the innovation that the halloween update brought.  Not recommended - 4/10",

Granted it came out of nowhere with its Freddy-Krueger style animatronics to get us excited, but apart from that, the 'Final Chapter' (or not) was really just a reskin of the first game. Which, don't get me wrong, was great and all, but is it worth repeating it just for the sake of a fourth instalment? Seriously, the mechanics are near-identical. Look left and right for Bonnie and Chica, always remember to check back on Foxy (whether he's hidden behind a closet or a curtain), and Freddy...well him and his chldren are basically replacing the Puppet and its music box from the second game.  Not only that, but this game's worst sin by FAR is how it screwed up the timeline. Before this one, we had the story of this game series mapped out to near perfection, and it had been so fun to uncover all the secrets. This game dropped a nuclear bomb on all of that; upturning everything we thought we knew and starting the infamous Bite of 87 vs 83' debate. However, despite all of this, this game's saving grace was the horror. This quality had been lacking from numbers 2 and 3, but boy did it make a comeback in 4! The audio cues combined with silent ambience really ramp up the creepy vibe, not to mention the simply ingenious breathing mechanic. Every time you go to a door, you're on the edge of your seat. And for that sole reason, I recommend this albeit unecessary prequel to a prequel to a sequel.",

I really enjoyed playing fnaf but Im still trying to beat all of them.  I figured some theories out about all of them. The Nightmare animatronics in FnaF4 arent real they are just the crying childs 'Nightmare' so when the bite of '87' happened, before he died he was sent to the hospital, so like in the game before it happened his brother kept scaring him with a foxy head. So like i said after the Bite of '87' he started having nightmares about himself being in his house with Nightmaric Animatronics roaming around his house.   The 'Crying' childs dad is the Purpleman 'Scott Cawthon' and he gets mad of his sons death so thats when all of FnaF1,2,3 all happened. but in FnAF3 the purple man gets killed and becomes 'Springtrap'. And thats what I think of the timeline and story  So like i said earlier FnAF is a really fun and horroric game that makes people jump. I hope you can keep updating and I hope FnAF world can come out soon.   Thank you, Scott Cawthon for reading, hopefully you can comment back :D ",

It had jumpscares, so it got some reactions from the big YouTubers (not saying I like jumpscares, I think they're one of the laziest techniques in horror), it had an interesting backstory and above all else, it was different and fun. I myself enjoyed it once I gave it a chance. I was extremely excited when the sequel's trailer came out and in my opinion, it lived up to the hype. More stuff was happening in the story and there was so much in the game. The amount of different characters was insane, giving you more surprises the more often you played. The gameplay was a bit more complicated too, making it so that you had to be focusing on more than a couple of things. Unfortunately, the third game decided to focus on doing things more than it did the characters, there were hardly any threats in it compared to the second game, making it far less exciting. The third game was when the series stopped being fun. However, Scott decided to make a fourth game, and it was just as boring if not more boring. There were some cool new characters but still, this game bought nothing new to the table. Like many others, this game did not succeed in scaring me or creeping me out. So much for being a horror. It's quite a shame that Scott's making another game in the franchise. I hope that he learns how to make a genuinely creepy horror, but I doubt he will. Do I recommend this game? I don't. Will I be getting the next game? Hm... maybe. I don't know. Chances are that I won't, but if the next trailer(s) somehow grabs my attention, I might.  (Oh, by the way, I've spent more time on this game then 0.2 hours. I've completed it, it was on my old account though.)",

Every time I try to move my mouse quickly, usually due to the game's tendency to shove the cursor out of itself, I look behind me.  And what the heck is wrong with the game's visuals?

It has the same paranoia inducing atmosphere I've come to expect, though something about the ambience this time enables me to not be as anxious or scared. That isn't to say the game is less scary, as I have been jumped a few times already (I really need to listen for when they leave the door, really).  What I find truly horrifying is the breathing. My god, why do they breathe.  You can bet I'll be trying to beat this game. Though I am not looking forward to Night 5 (and beyond) at all.  Because of HIM.  So do I recommend this game? If you liked any of the previous three titles, you must get this game. The game mechanics, the smooth animations (I love seeing the floor rushing past as you run to a door), and the animatronic designs themselves are very worth it. And if that doesn't satisfy you, there are story minigames between nights.  Listen before you look. Learn from your mistakes. And for god sakes, do not rush.  Haste makes waste.",

In the other games, I could usually tell when I messed up and I was about to be jump scared. For example, gurgling in the room, Mangle sounds, the puppet music, Spring Trap's face at the door, etc. There was some sound that indicated you screwed up, then you would be ready to be jumped at. This game jumps at you the moment you screw up. Much scarier because you're less ready. Also you have to listen to very quiet sounds so you have to have the volume up loud. This game is good.

Add a form of security:like an ipad for example, Through that you can see Nightmare Mangle and use the music box mechanic from FNAF 2 to stop the nightmare marionette. Also Nightmare versions of the toy and phantom animatronics including springtrap.If this was DLC i'd pay anything. Also one more thing the Freddy head to stop nightmare toy bonnie and the other nightmare toys. You can hide under a bed. HALLOWEEN MODE adds Jack-o-chica, Jack-o-bonnie and pumpkin without replacing any animatronics. A seperate camera to keep an eye on Plushtrap and balloon boy if you don't then the only way to stop them from jumscaring you is hiding under the bed. Also balloon boys balloon as a jumpscare i hope scott uses this because it would be cool 10/10 5/5 for the game and the halloween update",

I am very terrified since I have not played a Five Nights at Freddy's game in a while, at least about a month or two. Glad Scott has been able to achieve the scary atmosphere factor in this game.

I am shown a 8-bit golden freddy with purple hat and tie, telling me I was locked in my bedroom again. It brings me to a miniscene, where I control a little crying child. Off to the bottom right corner, I see the 4 animatronics in plush form, and the same bear in the prologue is on my bed, with piercing white eyes. I bash against my door, then lay down crying. The words linger in the air 'Tomorrow is a new day'  I then appear in a dark bedroom, the only light I see is from one flashlight I had when I arrived. I see 2 bedroom doors and a closet. I also have access to my bed, where I honk the plush freddy's nose.  I then cre........  Y'know what, this is gonna take me 5 hours to write, so to wrap up quickly, here's a short version of the story  1.) Boot up the game 2.) Saw the background 3.) Started a new game 4.) Got really far till 4 AM 5.) Looked in a door, got spooked by Nightmare Bonnie, screamed loud af and woke a family member, then closed the game and got the ♥♥♥♥ out of there  Though I almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself, it was pretty scary, and it's hard for me to get scared.

But it is pretty scary. The atmosphere in my opinion is intense and I kinda have to work up my grit to play it. Not something I had to do with the previous 3 games. And the jumpscares actually manage to make me jump most of the time. In the other games, it only scared me the first few. I'd say yeah it's good. I like the difference and I like the challenge.

I cant hear a thing even with my head phones on full so a constintly are crapping my pants becuase i didn't know stupid Bonnie was thier! This game has alot of potential and hopefully wont be the last game in the series which I think it wont be becuase I heard a new Fnaf game was coming out called Fnaf World so that got me exited thus making me pee my pants for the one millionth time! I find this game is bad for my bladder so thats why I dont play it anymore. Also something wierd I found out was that thier was a fricken night 10! Night 10, you gotta be kidden me so anyway my friend played it and I had to sit on the toilet for the rest of the day cause it was sooooo scary!!! Also he died at 1 AM so, LOL.

No  I've sat through the FNAF series since the first game with every itteration followed by my brother buying the next game and never playing it and me playing it on his library. I love the series and loved this itteration. Are all the sequels neccessary? Not really but they really aren't ever. I still can say that I enjoyed them and I am glad they were made. Though uneccesary (to someone who doesn't care for the 'continuation' of the series) it is still good as a stand alone with great 'tower defense' mechanics and, still, a lot of tactics and thought to go into it.  Before this I would say that FNAF 2 was the best in the series (though 3 was a fun experience that I shared with my sister, it wasn't scary nor required much effort). FNAF 2 added so much to the established formula without any of it being unnecessary and it all meshed nicely and still put up a fight to be beat. This game is beautiful in the opposite direction. As a person that sees the beauty in games it is amazing how much was stripped from the formula yet still made it more difficult than 1 (and 3 I guess). When a game uses the bare minimum but still challenges you is when a game maker's thought proccess shines. I was in awe at how listening became an important mechanic as it was a double edged sword for this itteration. By listening you not only raise your chances of survival, but you also make the jumpscare penalty scarier on yourself. I can say I jumped a bunch of times when I first started playing. In the end, the rush of figuring out the mechanics is just as sweet as the mental reward that theorizing gives you (especially when you finally make it to night 5). All in all this game betters the mechanics, graphics and overall gameplay that even if you're not one for the storytelling of the series it is still as satisfying as FNAF 2 to learn the mechanics and best this complicated yet predictable game.

This comes in two parts actually. One, the jumpscares to rest-of-game ratio is off the charts. Everything is quiet which is fine, but the jumpscares come out like a mortar shooting next to your eardrum. Lower that jumpscare please, it doesn't have to be even half as loud as it is now to scare me. -Volume point two, the breathing mechanic. I'm sure it works, and I can pretty much tell if Chica is there. But Bonnie. Bonnie Bonnie Bonnie. I cannot seem to hear him to save my life (literally). He gets me everytime. It might be because I'm not listening as intently as I could because I'm afraid if I 'do' miss it then the jumpscare volume will make me go to the hospital, so I may be holding back. But I think the breathing should at least be noticeable, maybe even amplified in the early nights. I just don't like losing a game through technicality, im okay if it's because I made a mistake I know I made.   Here's to hoping those things get fixed because they hold the game back for me from being absolutely perfect. Great job on the entirety of it, in it's whole.

Bottom line if you want to play this as effectively as you possibly can, you'll throw a pair of surround sound headphones on and blast the volume. You will her footsteps left and right, the closet creak, the Fred Jrs screaming behind you, and the heavy breathing at the door. The fact that you need to listen so intently to the audio makes the jumpscares even more effective because you are so focused.  3) The design of the models is great compared to previous games. Scott really has improved since the first game.  4) More storyline!  What I didn't like:  1) Although I liked the storyline added and how it was delivered, I would have liked a bit more of the loose ends cleared up in the GAME and not left supposedly to the movie.

It retains a similar type of gameplay as the previous games, similar to FNaF 2 where you must worry about what's to the front, left and right of you. But FNaF 4 now adds a feature where you have to worry what's behind you as well.  This game HEAVILY relies on sound in order for you to actually get to 6AM for all of the nights(especially Night 5 and nightmare modes), so make sure to use a decent headset and not speakers.  If you're also into the story as well as the gameplay, Scott Cawthon certainly delivered. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but it definitely raises even more questions rather than answering the preexisting ones to the lore. It remains a mystery(unless you're able to put all the pices together and discover the lore).  Anyhow, if you like jumpscare games or just like the FNaF games, FNaF 4 is an ok game to play.",

You cheated the game... until Fredbear cheated you.  In all seriousness tho, I beat the game in under an hour (Without editing the files) (And got jumpspooked by the cupcake) and I DID enjoy it, but it loses replay ability once you unlock every challenge and cheat and beat the challenges and use the cheats. The fact that you can complete everything under an hour is kinda sad. BUT! I gotta say this IS (in my opinion) the BEST Five Night's at Freddy's game of the series (Unless Sister Location is even better) and the scariest, as unlike the previous games, the jumpscares are the least expected, mainly because of bad timing.   Example: You have the house map on. You see on the map that Bonnie is at the middle of the hall. You go to the door to use the light to lure him off, but as SOON as you flash the light, Bonnie conviently moves in front of the door, he goes 'Oogly Boogly', and you ♥♥♥♥ your pants. Thanks House Map...   But I also like that, it inspires me to not trust cheats.   This reveals a lot of the story too. The bite of '87 gets revealed. And NO I will not tell you who did it, you can find out for yourself, well, that is if you can beat night 5.  The gameplay is pretty simple. You close doors, check hallways, check closets for furries and your bed for killer teddy bears. RIP Cameras, not here today.  There is that intense factor in this game. PRESSURE. You lured Bonnie away, but being lucky dude/dudette you are, Chice is standing outside of the right door, and there are three freddies on the bed, and foxy is ready to jump up and steal your cheeks. You could lure all four monster robot thingys of hell if you could, but don't get Ctrl and Shift mixed up, or else Chica will scream in your face like an angry hispanic mother, and not only does your character die, but your ears go ripparoni as well, so don't mix those two buttons up.  My recommendation: Buy the game! If you complete EVERYTHING in under 2 hours, request a refund and get your money back, or keep the game, it's your money.... or your parents money.",

Jump scares are considered cheap because so many games/movies/whatever do them sooooo poorly. But this game, and the whole series, delivers them incredibly effectively.  I think 3 was a good idea in changing the formula, but I am very happy with how this came back to the formula that worked so well but made audio so much more important. Giving patience to listen while you are stressed about so many other factors really adds to the tension. You really decide your fate by paying enough attention and when all that tension comes to a mistake it is your fault and the jump-scare is that much more effective.  I do agree with many in saying that the animatronics are too gruesome and it is taking away from the effect it had before. In the original, the soulless eyes but otherwise unthreatening demeanor was what made them so effective to me.  Keep up the outstanding effort.",
