            "review_text": "Pretty good and fun deckbuilduing strategy game with the same mechanics as Star Realms but with cartoony-cthulhu theme which put me off a bit at first, but after a while it grew on me. The soundtrack and background sounds are moody and well made. The interface is fine, but could use some double-clicks and things on the cards instead of drag-n-drop or requiring two separate clicks. I played through the free 8 mission campaign which was a good romp and I will be considering getting the full version.",

Their voices are made of poison! When you listen you are sure to be disturbed. You can lock your doors, you can say your prayers, no creature can resist their wicked words! Never mind! No need to worry, that's all just a story... of the whispers of the cardstone fiesta.",

I blame this on the small number of cards, and a bit more variety would go a long way into making it better.  I have had no trouble in running the game, and it hasn't crashed on me either, which is a plus.  I do wish I could refund the $5 I spent on unlocking the full version, because it really isn't worth the cash to be honest, but it was my fault in not reading up on what it added.  Still I recommend the game to people that enjoy deck building games, but also to those that like card games in general, and are looking for something new to play. The Free version anyway.  (Still I wouldn't buy the full version until a sale...then again it is only $5 in the end)",
