I can only pray for Anno 2205's fate as any franchise sharing a destiny with Ubisoft is doomed to collapse.

However, first it runs a secondary program as a type of updater/DRM that for some reason reset my WMPlayer and I had to re-confirm my players settings. Really not cool since a few codex came up missing.   Secondly you need a account with ubisoft before you play. I never got to play as I'm a firm believer that if I purchase a game here on Steam, I expect to download and play. Not take part in secondary registrations and e-mail gathering. After discovering this, I noticed the small “Requires a UPlay account' at the very bottom. This needs to be stated more clearly on the games you provide Steam.  If this does not bother you then by all means pick it up, as for me this will be the last time I get anything from Ubisoft.  ***FYI the Ubisoft Game Launcher DOES NOT uninstall after removing the game on Steam. You have to use your control panel to do so.***",

It is an above ground and underwater city builder with complex city management and trade. HOWEVER, UPlay is a horrendous gaming network and a DRM of 3 installs is appalling (to say it kindly). When I discovered I could only install this on 3 machines I was quite disappointed.   Ubisoft support also seems seriously lacking. My son recently made purchase of a hardcopy ubisoft title, registered it to his account but could not download it - was just stuck in a registration loop. He was outright ignored by Ubisoft/Uplay official support contact - even after posting for help on their Facebook page. Eventually he exchanged the game for something worth twice as much (and not needing Uplay). So he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his problem. Within minutes they deleted his post from the page making us well aware that Uplay had seen his original help request but they had deliberately ignored it.  I'd hate to see what will happen when I have to contact them for a new key for Anno when I next upgrade my machine. If the same DRM restrictions exist for the new Anno when it is released I simply wont be buying it ... ever. In fact my experience with the few Uplay games I do own has taught me to be extremely wary of investing in any Ubisoft games again.",

Multiplayer attempts failed to work well, and too often the map just seemed to run out, leaving goals unmanageable.

This entry in the series is a technical advance, but it has taken the organic feel of 1404 and sterilised it, losing a lot in the process. Much of the appeal of the original was finding your own solution to a very broad set of objectives, but 2070 adds a campaign that provides a rigid structure to the missions that feels far too constrained, and it has thrown in additional mechanics that serve only to restrict how you can build and interact with the world.  If you enjoy these kinds of management games, I'd recommend picking up 1404 plus its expansion, Venice, before even considering Anno 2070.",

Its full of a rather LARGE number of things to do if you get the final, complete version. has quite a bit of gameplay mechanics to learn and enjoy, and so long as your patient, can give you plenty of challenges to enjoy. the learning curve isnt overwhelming but there is one to it, but as with any city builder/resource management game, thats to be expected. all in alll i give this game  Graphics:9/10 (a few issues here and there with graphical bugs but mostly perfection)  Sound 10/10 (the music is beautiful, with decent sound effects and good quality to sound placement (and a few funny things from your dwellers if you zoom in on them)  Story 7/10 (This game lacks somewhat in the story department. It does have a story but nothing grand or utterly new. As you would expect, Nature, Money, Science, Take a choice and the story follows.)  Gui/Controles 8/10 (the controles feel pretty natural for a game of this type, though there where some issues finding things in the GUI at first. The controles and keys can be remapped in game which is a plus and once you learn the basic locations of things, it gets really easy)  Overall 8.5/10 (Go and play this game. you will enjoy it)  *side note* I have never experianced ANY issues ever with uplay. I have, however, Seen plenty of issues both here and with friends, dealing with the DRM system crashing. I recommend you download uplay from ubisoft and make sure that, not only can you run it, but that you find out what is causing the crash in the first place (most of the issues and solutions can be found online, with a short google search. The game issue i found with friends is that it wasnt installed using Admin mode or run under admin mode with windows 7 and up) ",

A few notes before the game critique:   You can still resolve issues with Uplay by installing Uplay before downloading and activating this game through Steam. There's some manual patching you need to do, but that does put off a large portion of the audience. Pick it up if you're willing to put in the effort to get it working; as of late 2015, Ubisoft hasn't addressed any of the fundamental problems with getting it running   Make sure you have a machine you'll play through the entire game with, because this Steam version acts as one copy. I can't play this copy anymore because I upgraded to Windows 10; and thus my previous machine (which I can't go back to) has this copy on it. Make sure you've got it on a medium that Ubisoft trusts you to have it with, be it on Uplay originally or a physical copy.   This is not the game for you if you don't have great internet.

It was released in November 2011 and is a great game. I've put 7 hour sessions into this game, and I show no signs of stopping. It is a new, futuristic step in the series, and is a strong one.  The basic premise of the game is that the world's sea levels have risen and previous landmasses have become islands, and uninhabitable wastelands have become paradises. It is your mission to repopulate the world from your ark - a kind of sea station.  The ocean is a major focus of this game Much of the expansion and all battle and trading is done by sea. This makes a unit's speed, carrying capacity, armour and damage ever more important. The trading mechanism works really well, being able to set up a different route with each unit is easy and intuitive.  The game is great. It has an interesting style and great development of cities - better in my opinion than the newer Sim Cities. For example, my capital city on my industrial playthrough was growing and I was doing well, and I expanded onto another island. When I went back to my capital, I realised how dense the smog was around the city. It's details like that that really help build immersion and realism.  It's easy to sink hours into a game and not reach the endgame, or even the midgame. If you are a fan of real time strategy games like Age of Empires, then this game is a perfect purchase for you. This award winning mixture of diplomacy, war and construction is sure to win you over to it.",

            "review_text": "**Pro's** Tons of replay and achevements Nice graphics Low system requirements Challanging to play with tons of micromagament 2 and a half playable factions **Con's** Tons of micromanagement, if you dont like that. Uplay &amp; DRM  **Detailed walkthrough of experience** The game is beautiful and runs very well on my 9 year old PC with max graphics. Causes a little system lag with other programs but minimizing the game fixes this problem in my experience. Outside of small bugs here and there you will encounter in any game this game runs flawlessly with some of the best pathing AI I have seen. Alot of stuff has to be unlocked though gameplay such as player colors, you start out with 4 or 5 colors and unlock more by playing for specific factions durring missions or free play when you complete achevements or special missions in the name of those factions.  Graphically the world is very alive.... you can see towns foke walking around the streets, cars zipping around, police/fire/ambulances running from their buildings to emergency sites including things like hazmat teams quarenteening a house if an epidemic breaks out or fire coming out of a buildings windows if theirs a fire. The world changes based upon its Eco balance, the higher you get the greener and brighter everything seems, the lower you get the darker and gloomier everything looks. BAsed on gameplay settings the eco balance even has effects on your island, causing things like tornados (negative) or tropical thunder storms (positive).  DLC is so well integrated into the game that you can bairly tell it wasnt a basic function, Im still lost on what some of the DLC is or does cause I bought the game and DLC all at once durring the summer sale. Most of the DLC is cosmetic items, such as fountains and parks that can add varity to how your cities look but is completely optional. Other DLC include technologys you cannot get though base game play such as the Eco Balance building Keeper 1.0, New player/account protrates/colors, a few new units, new missions. The only actual expansion to the game itself how ever is Deep Ocean, It adds a new civilization level to the technology faction, S.A.A.T, as well as new missions, buildings, achevements, technologies, disasters and more. If you buy any DLC Deep ocean is a must.  Modules and technology allow for nearly limitless customization, and micromagament can either be a fun or hair pulling experence. Missions are well made and challange you. Even with 100 hours into the game some missions are even still to hard for me to complete.  All maps are randomly generated based on values you can set in before generating the world. There is even artifacts that can be abled from past civilizations that effect the eco balance positively or negatively to even further add varity and challange to gameplay.  2 and a half factions make this game very replayable, and due to the randomization of every map only more so. Why I say 2 and a half factions is because the 3rd research faction, S.A.A.T, does not have basic construction buildings for things like construction blocks or tools, making it impossible to play on its own. It is a supliment to the other two. Even mixing the basic two factions, Tycoons and Eco Warriors, can have benifits. Spit islands and use mining points for iron and copper and use the Tycoons coal diggers to fuel the smelters to provide Eco Warriors with tools to construct Eco Balance buildings. Thats just a simple example of how using both can come to an advantage.  Continus gameplay is astonishing in this game, unlike most I have seen. You can build a civilization, get some base work done, stock up on some materials, load it all into your arc and leave. Start a new map and use all of that stockpile to quickly build a new civilization and keep going. Technology unlocks from research are account unlocks, meaning if you unlock it its unlocked forever. This does add a bit of a 'level cap' of sorts to the game but you can always choose to restart by emptying everything, including technology upgrades from your arc and starting fresh with no help from previous games if you wish to keep playing continus mode. You can disable continus play all togeather in the game options when you make a map. Research how ever unless you disable it in the game options, is perminant, I havent figured out how to reset that other then to make a new account and buy the game again.  I only have 1 comment to make on Uplay. Its useless. I dont mean Uplay itself is usesless, or poorly made, its just not needed, not required. You have to install the game though steam, download Uplay (automatic if you install with steam), make a Uplay account, Update the game. When you launch it from steam, steam launches Uplay then Uplay launches Anno 2070. Its annoying but has never gotten in the way. Steam Ingame overlay works, but you need to readd your friends to Uplays friends list to play online with them less I missed something  Online play is smooth and challanging in its own right though buyer be ware, DRM on this game is 24/7. BEFORE you panic, the game WILL run if you have launched it once with steam running, but all achements and online play will be disabled if you are playing in offline mode. Because certain things like research unlocks, Ark Storage and the like are bound to your account these will also be disabled. So if your looking to advance in the game your gonna have to be online with a live active connection. On that note, my significant other who uses Wild Blue Satalight internet can play this game online with only a little hickup now and then, in which case the game normally automatically reconnects unlike others. So less you are running dial up or a version air card or something like that, DRM should be the least of your concerns. I Have a DSL connection and I have never once had a connection issue related to this game. Offline play is good if your at a friends house and just want to burn time or at an airport waiting for a plane but not good for long term play unless you dont mind playing one map or starting over repeatedly.  Over all I would give this game a 8 out of 10. Uplay is unneeded and accounts should be stored locally should you get disconnected so when you reconnect you dont have to reload a mission level or lose progress. Outside of that though the game is beautiful, runs fine, never crashed (yet), fun to play with hundreds of hours of play and replay and the randomization keeps everything interesting. I highly recommend this game over any other city/civilization builder. If you read this whole thing, I would like to take a second to thank you for honoring me by doing so even if you do not agree with my assement of the game.",

But anyhow, I do not endorse to talk down a game because of a copy protection / user login method.  It is a very nice and interesting game, that I recommend - the Anno series (originally from Sunflowers) is unique in it's way! And although I was in fact sceptical about an Anno, playing not in the past, it is really fun playing - even after about 2 years and about 200 hours * - the publishers have made it to keep the feeling and atmosphere of the earlier sequels.  The improvements in goods chains, diversity and also graphics and sounds - not to forget the ark, where you can store goods or items from game to game, career points/daily tasks - do not go without notice ... from 1602 to 1701 to 1404 and now to 2070.  Even positive to tell is, that not like 1701, also beginners can switch to an easy enough difficulty mode.  So my conclusion: If you tend to grumble about a few seconds waiting on Uplay ... do not buy. If you can wait on a login (and you know that Ubi is not the only company, who want to save their software against piracy) and you want to play and support a very good, interesting and somehow challenging ... then buy and have fun.  I am - for my person - hope that it will not be the last sequel (even it could be hard to better the game itself). That is for sure the reason, I do not like those reviews, telling only about Uplay!!  PS: * My gaming hours are only the ones from the Steam version",

The underwater mechanic is also extremely well done and very interesting.  My only gripe is that the two 'sides' are pretty contrived and extremist...you're either insanely anti-environment or pro-environment, it would be nice to have some intermediate or other teams to play, but honestly it's not much of a complaint, it fits the overall theme of the game really well.  the two teams also play completely differently, which is very refreshing - most games would take the easy way out and just make a carbon copy for a new team and only change the visual aspects, but they are literally different in almost every way, from the resources you collect, to how your tech trees expand, down to your individual units.  i recommend this to ANYONE who likes any kind of resource management, transportation, combat-lite, etc. fantastic game, worth every penny.",

Anno 2070, while set in a futuristic dystopia and populated by factions divided by their approach to techology and resource preservation, is functionally identical to its predecessors. This is a good thing, as those mechanics are both fun and unique in the strategy genre.   In the Anno games you start out with a small settlement which you need to expand by building residences. As the population increases, they will begin to demand certain goods which you can provide by building production structures.   It is these production structures which drive the Anno series. Resources are not just produced from a single entity. Instead resources will need to move through a supply chain until they finally produce a finished good at the last stage. As your population advances and new demands emerge, you'll find your supply chains stretched thin as demand pulls raw resources and processed resources along multiple paths.  While a sandbox mode is available, In the campaign and several missions you'll face the additional challenge of enemy factions, requiring you to accomodate defensive and offensive production into your already complicated supply chains.   If the idea of a futuristic dystopia marred by ecological disaster and populated by idelogically driven factions is appealing to you, and you can stomach Ubisoft's intrusive DRM layer, then you'll enjoy Anno 2070. If those hurdles are a bit too much, then I recommend playing Anno 1404 instead.",

The main drawback (aside from those ANNOying series persistant things, like tools and not being able to sketch out a functional road network before you place that somewhat costy Community center) is Uplay. This terrible bundle of malware and uselessness is the reason it took me about an hour to get this game to run. What were they thinking?

I initially wanted to give a thumb down myself for that sole reason, it really is that bad.

The big complaint is that the launcher won't allow you to play the game. I can understand that. When you buy a game you just want it to work. Well my Uplay launcher updated and it stopped working. When I clicked play it would crash to desktop before launching a game. A quick google search lead me to change a single windows permission and it worked perfectly.

Not because it's not futuristic but because the gameplay was better. There was more thing to do, the venician addon was just awesome, and in general, the gameplay was more consequent. One of the main issue I had with 2070 was the military part. It has always been a great problem for me that this part of the game is left over by all anno game, but still, anno 1404 had a good military part.  Anno 2070 has like, well nothing good. I mean, it take hell of a time to have a bit of real armed fleet, and there absolutly NO WAY to invade the land with man. You must use aircraft through the tech tree and this take even more time.  Plus, and this is awful to me, the eco has like no military stuff at all... Well, just hated that from the game.   Then there's the expectation that weren't there such as greater island, better diplomacy gameplay, more interaction with AI and so on. There's so much thing to do.   Now, I still recommand this game for a simple reason. This IS a good game. Even though it was some kind of a disappointment to me, I've had great time playing it. The underwater ain't as fun as it could have been but is still intersting. The multiplayer part has never been use so well and that was realy interesting and new.

It should work for you) -Once you have played one campaign mission you have played them all. (They are all build up and maybe do something else)",

It works just fine now.  Concerning the game, it's the most beautiful game of that kind I played and you'll be expected to spend over 200+ hours at least to find 75% of its content. A real long-time investment. Each one of the three 'civilization' has been fully worked on, and you'll need to manage the three of them to discovered the most beautiful part of the game. It's a game that requires good managing and planning skills, and otherwise, train you about these.   The best thing to do on this game is a cooperation game. Again, all problems with the multiplayer has been removed as I didn't encountered one throughout the entire year.  Playing this game in cooperation will enable to split the tasks, what will make you enormous gain in time and optimization (as long as you get along with your partner about the planning, but it's abvout the game).   Seriously, if you like this kind of game and want to make a real long time investment (although Anno 2205 is coming), this game is perfect to you. For the cons, I find this game perhaps too long (I play offline so don't think I'm only about 30hours on this game) and although it is beautiful, the weak computers will suffer on it.

I loved all of the different building chains and the factions, I found that resource management was really well done as you had your primary (tools, basalt etc) and secondary for the town folk (food, drink, etc). If you have played Anno 1404 you should feel right at home with this one just with a more futuristic feel it pratically the same game (feels more like an expansion then something new). But overall this game is at the top of its game as far as eco strat's go.  The bad:  The game does seem to drag itself out more then really needed, I have made great economies on the game just to be waiting for resources to become available just to attack an enemy for 2 minutes and find im capped (maybe a resource reduction like warcraft 3 would help?) . The graphics are good but the sound does get rather repetitive after a while with the same voice dialogues repeating over and over. I also found the campaign mode rather limited and short, just as i had started to get into the story the game was over which left me feeling rather unfullfilled.   Overall:  This game is a must buy for all fans of ANNO, settlers and any other strong economy based stratergy fans. I try to review the good and bad but overall for every 1 bad thing in the game there is 10 good things. I just hope the DRM on this game is removed soon if it hasn't already. ",

            "review_text": "I've only just started playing 2070, but I am already a big fan.  My first Anno game was 1503. I remember getting it when I was pretty young, when I was looking for Age of Empires 2. When I couldn't find a copy, I bought this instead. Being that I was young, I didn't fully get how to play, but I did immensely enjoy the experience.  Now, with 2070, the first game I've actively played since (I played a little of 1404, but not much) I can see soo much coming from this series.  The biggest plus for me is the music: A sense of foreboding with the end of the old world, but also a little bit of hope with the new one. Set in 2070, in a world partially flooded (presumably from global warming), you can choose between two main factions: The Industrial faction, and the Green faction. Each plays slightly different, but the mechanics are the same.  Mechanically, it's pretty similar to other Anno games. You set up a town, set trade routes with other settlements of your own and of other players, AI or real people. There is combat, but it's simplistic 'click here to kill' style. Fortunately, it isn't the focus of the game.  The game is infinitely replayable, if a tad repetitive. From what I've seen so far, there aren't too many visual differences between islands. There are multiple missions, a sandbox mode, asynchronous (thank goodness) multiplayer, and other things I haven't seen yet, but each mode starts almost identically. There's no problem with a bit of repetition, but that's just so you're aware of it.  In short, it's worth it, especially now it's on sale. You do need a steady internet connection to play it properly though. ",

The music is good but if you get tired of it than turn it off and run your own in the background. The story is interesting. The AI opponets can be amusing and the game allows you to build a sandbox as you like with AI players you pick yourself or none at all if you like. You can lose hours in this game and you will know it becuase your own AI in the game will chide you to go have a meal or take a break. At the current under 10 dollar price this game is a must have for any player who loves city building style games. Snatch it and you can thank me later.  Added: I noticed one complaint that the game can't be played without an active internet connection. Since I also complained about the uplay requirement I should be clear that the game can be played off line. It claims that some features are sacraficed by doing so and it probably means multiplayer but I play it off line all the time. I can't help but do so since I don't have the most reliable internet service.",

Just download and install the newest version of Uplay before you install the game and Anno would run normally. Seems like Steam was too lazy to incorporate a newer version of Uplay into the game, hence all the hassles with it. Now that is out of the way, let's get to the game itself: I daresay this game is comparable to a gem. No, not the beautiful, gorgeous kind of gem, think of it more like a rough gem, that through progession, become more than rough. First 5 mins into Anno and I was INSTANTLY overwhelmed by just how much I have to learn. Firstly, you need building materials to build your city (duh!), but there's already a catch: all buildings require maintenance, and once I've set up all neccessary production building, my income was negative. To counter that, I need more people to settle in so I can tax them, and then I have to set up even more production buildings to support them. And what happen to a city with lots of people and industry? Yeap, pollution. Decreased happiness, Increased disaster rate, there's even a faction that would declare war upon anyone who destroy the ecobalance too much. Of course the game offer a solution to it: there are buildings that improve ecobalance, at the cost of hurting your economy (they require a fair amount of maintenance too).Then, as you progess, your people would require more than just basic food. They need activity, they need social services (Police, Fire Station, Hospital), they need more variety in food supply... which put EVEN MORE pressure on production chain. The game simply make it impossible to advance without expand, which then require a trade route, since, you know, goods ain't delivered themselves. Feeling dizzy yet? Good, because that's how the game keep you busy: and endless cycle of building, expanding, managing trades, fixing ecobalance, optimizing things... And did I mention there's a pirate faction and a private contractor, both of which would make your job even harder. To sum it up, Things I like: - Pretty graphics, you can feel the city grows as you progess, the people and traffic animation is also nice. - Solid gameplay, economy and production is consistent and makes sense to me. - Provide lots of depth, Anno can pretty much keep you busy for up to 20 hours without boredom. Things I don't like: - Tutorial is somewhat lacking, although there's an in-game AI assitant called 'EVE', she's really not that useful. My first city was a terrible mess just so I can learn what goes where. especially the trade management. If you can get your head around it in 10 mins, I envy you :( - Require alot of trial-and-error, you can literally have to spend up to 5 hours just to learn the basic. Hell, even youtube doesn't have a proper tutorial video. - Feels more like a economy management game and a city building game. But it's just my opinion really. Things I feel neutral: - Combat isn't polished, but hey, it's a city builder, of course the devs don't pay that much attention to combat system. - Late-game content: there's not much challenge to tackle once you advance to high tech tree. Your fleet can triple or even quadruple the size of your rival's fleets, you have access to nuclear missile and bomber that can obliterate anything, and your economy can support a perfect eco balance everywhere unless you mess up really, really bad. All in all, I give Anno a solid 9,5/10, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good city-building game.  ",

Don't have a lot of hours on Steam version. However its a bucket of fun. The DLC also expands the city building to underwater, which makes it awesomer.   I never had one single issue with the Uplay launcher like many others. Just download Uplay from the Uplay site instead of using the outdated version from Anno installer.  There is also a few mods for Anno, which can be played online if you use the same mods and 'Anno cookie' to enable online if using edited files.   Some of the mods to check out are -Tycoon mod -adds a buch of new stuff for 3 factions and allows a variety in resource buildings.  -Anno 2170 AARC - Allows much more types of getting resources and varients also allows city building on water. And much more. Extends gameplay much more.   9/10 -1 for the fact I have to launch through an external client. If you release on steam please don't force your client on them. I have no issues for it just its a waste of CPU power and RAM when I never use it.",

Instead of Orient and Occident, you now have 3 culture types who can accomplish much of the same tasks with different pros and cons- for example, the Tycoon option for power plants are cheap and effective but have a negative impact on the environment, causing your planting fields to be less effective on that island. The Eco options may be a bit more expensive but they improve your environmental footprint. The third type is the tech-oriented culture, who let you research and build enhancements. There's also the option for undersea colonies and submarines.  Overall it's just more and better goodies for Anno players. There are also a lot of cool 'always-online' features that can stretch the replay value beyond the completion of the campaign.   Currently, UbiSoft seems to be on the cash-grab tip, so the only other option in the Anno series is the mobile freemium one. Hopefully this won't be the last entry in the series but it doesn't look promising. Soak up the production-chain goodness while you can.",

Furthermore, the gameplay itself is boring, and that is coming from a fan of resource micromanagement games such as Gnomoria which have much lower production values. I don't normally review games but this was a special circumstance. I had to work just to play it, it sucked gameplay-wise / was not original, and ended up crashing on me within the first 10-20 minutes.

For a YEAR, this game wouldn't work based on the UPlay update bug/DRM crap (I did the remove, reinstall, all of it, but mind you, this was on an UNCHANGED machine when UPlay failed, played 1400 hours, then it just stopped working)...   So, tenuously, I get AC4-BF a year on, still a bit disappointed I can't play 2070, worried UPlay will bork AC as well and during the AC setup it reinstalls UPlay and suddenly Anno works again. An unexpected outcome. UbiSoft, when addressing the UPlay update issue, spewed mightily forth with typical unsupportive Support ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It was their error. They sure seem to think it was my machines fault... (unchanged hardware, played 1400 hours, then suddenly, it fails. Yup. For sure. My fault... gimps.) How come AC4BF install fixed it? Nottafrigginclue. I'm a gamer, not a software engineer. But I am glad it did.  I love this game, I will suffer UbiGimp to play it. You still have a choice/middle-ground option: Get 1404/Dawn of Discovery, and the Venice upgrade. Older, but still robust titles, no UPlay ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and decide if you like the 'Anno Civ Building', and the way the cultural/civil advancement works, get a cheaper feel for the mechanics of Anno. If you do like it, eventually get 2070. It's even more in-depth and complex. I much prefer 2070, but 1404 is a good starting ground to evaluate the series.",

Which I must say is very well done and a kick to play. So I'm updating my 'Do not purchse this game' to 'Purchase but beware'. I would have given this a complete thumbs up but the solution to the problem with this game came from the community and not from Ubisoft or Uplay. Which it should have in my opionion after emailing them. So a lot of what I said before still stands. The game is great the Uplay interface is not.  Do not purchase this game. The Uplay interface will crash continually and getting any help from Uplay/Ubisoft in rectifying this situation has been in vain. If you peruse the forums you'll find that this is common problem which Uplay/Ubisoft has known about for sometime but doesn't offer a fix on. I've played many, many games through Steam and other platforms but Uplay stands out as the worst. This isn't my first rodeo with them but it will be my last as every single time Uplay is involved with a game there are problems.  In my opinion Steam should make/take a stand and stop offering any purchases through them that offer a Uplay interface. I think then and only then they'll either fix the problem or drop the Uplay interface. By the way, Uplay doesn't nor has it ever added anything ever to any gaming experience you'll ever have with the game you've selected. It's more like a lame social media area designed around a 9 year old level.",

As soon as you purchase it you will find out that you will also need to install and register for uplay, ubisoft's own 3rd party DRM system, then permanently link your CD key to your uplay account. This does not only mean that every time you want to start the game, you need to log in TWICE - steam and uplay - but also, that you will FOREVER be bound to your uplay account, if you ever lose those account credentials you'll never be able to play the game again. This perhaps wouldn't be so bad if you actually keep things like this organized and the system would actually run flawlessly, but no luck. I left the game lying in my library for a couple of years then wanted to start it up again, only to find it asking me for my activation key again - to which it replied of course, that it has already been used. Well yes, OF COURSE it has, when I first bought the game... So now guess what? I'm locked out and can't play it any more even though I paid good money for it, and yes I was using the very same uplay account.  This is exactly the kind of DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that, dare I say, needs to be punished by the gamers in the form of not giving them a ♥♥♥♥ing dime of your money. Period.

It features a reasonable length campaign and many individual scenarios, each with specific constraints and/or objectives. Additionally, an endless mode allows you to experience all the game has to offer. I haven't played much of the multiplayer, although there are several multiplayer modes, which can be played competitively or cooperatively. Due to the games length however you may struggle to finish a multiplayer game. Anno 2070 features a drop-in drop-out system, where players can be invited to, and leave games, allowing any remaining players to continue playing. Any player may take any saved multiplayer game and finish it solo.  Production chains are interesting, and require constant expanding and tweaking to maintain the ever increasing demand of your workers. Research mostly yields efficiency upgrades for existing buildings, although the research is done through a separate faction which you control and expand alongside your chosen starting faction, adding even more complexity and depth to the game.  I love the game: It is without a doubt, one of my favorite city building games. However, I must mention Ubisofts Uplay 'service' here (I hesitate to call any mandatory software a service). It is required to play the game. The game can technically be played in an offline mode, however, you are required to install Uplay, and register your game key once to play the game. In fact, It took just over a week for me to receive a working cd-key via steam for the complete edition. This issue most likely will not affect future customers, but worth mentioning nonetheless. Aside from this, I have been able to play the game fine, and without issue for over 80 hours now.

The simulation is very nice and deep. Citizens have 4 basic needs you must fulfill and goods are produced through tiered production queues. For example for producing tools you need 2 kinds of mines and a steel smelter and a factory. The futuristic setting differentiates this from previous Anno games. For me that's a huge plus as I really enjoy good scifi more than historic of fantasy settings. There's been a few sales where Anno 2070 has been discounted 50-70%.

Now for the inevitable downsides, if you buy this game I would suggest doing it through Ubisoft, nothing against Steam, but when you buy that way (like I did) it takes forever to start the game. First it has to go through steam, then activate U-play and finally start the game (side note, if either one has a problem starting you have to start all over). Second would be the build interface. When you go to place something in build mode it is jumpy and what you are placing will randomely change directions on you causing you to place it wrong, without an undo button your left with destroying it and redoing it again.  This is neither good or bad but I wish you had the option of starting as the techs. You have to start with either Tycoon or eden and wait to get the techs later. If not then at least let us build underwater before you get to techs.",

Beware, this game has severely annoying alt-tab glitches - it's possible to alt-tab, but most people don't realize, it requires holding down alt-tab until the slider is whirring through the options, then releasing and perhaps throwing another alt-tab in the mix.

Installation was tricky and there is a very intrusive launcher, much like EA and Origin installer. However, the game would not load until I uninstalled uplay and went to their website to download it seperately and install. Once I got it up and running, there were few bugs and no crashes, which is a plus.  The premise of the game is simple. You settle and island with resources enough to build the basic starting structures. Each island has only a few basic resources, so you'll need to settle other islands to get accessed to more basic resources. Given there are three different factions with 4 levels of buildings in each plus a couple dozen basic resources that can be refined up to three different ways, you'll have lots to do. Even then, blueprints can be earned in a variety of ways to improve sectors, islands or units. You'll be attacked by other factions, and wage fights using an basic RTS interface.  Advancing your buildings can be daunting, but when you figure it out you are simply moving down a checklist of things you need to get, and then setting up a trade route to transfer it. Make no mistake, the checklists get to be a page long when you want to add a resource later in the game, but it isn't really challenging.  Anno 2070 plays like a city building game, but it never really felt like you were building a city. There was limited satisfaction in developing my island and very limited aesthetics or customization. The trading and economics were somewhat boring and static - bring resource X from place A to place B with ship Alpha so you can process it. The trading screen was overly simplistic.  The units and combat are right out of a 1990s RTS game that was dumbed down a ton. Which is a good thing since it's touted as a city building / strategy game. It's bad because you could remove it and the game would actually be better. I'd convert it to a more tower based game where you survive 'waves' or events that happen every 3 minutes. You could also make Anno a 100% strategy game where units aren't controlled directly, or a mission based game where units are more like hero units that embark on quests.  Is Anno 2070 good? I'm not really sure. I had a good time playing it through and it was highly addictive. There is always something to do. However, after a few dozen hours playing it was an easy delete off my system. I'm not really sure if a game like this can stand out. It does a lot of things well, but a lot poorly as well. However, it was definately worth my money and time to give it a spin.",

Instead of simply building your way to 'Tech 2' and beyond, you advance your technology by meeting the needs of your citizens. It's a different approach that pays off well by indirectly forcing exploration and trade.  However, as a strategy title, the combat is restricted to the point of periphery. Warships are expensive, but do not deliver pleasing results. And battles are usually facepalmingly overwhelming when fighting AI. Combat is definitely it's lowest selling point.  The multiplayer was not remarkable, and neither was the campaign, but I found myself sucked into that  'just one more turn'  sensation not usually found in RTS titles. There's strong incentive to keep playing long after you've won, and the setting is fun to explore, from your first underwater dive to your final aerial domination.   TL;DR  Nice visuals, and interesting premise, and a unique spin on resource management got well over 40 hours from me.

I almost asked for a refund but decided to try and boot the game a second time. Not sure why it worked, but it worked. This was 5-10 minutes after downloading.",

I've been doing several playthroughs of it, and it never ceases to amaze. The Tycoons suck huge donkey dong though.  Pros- Good building, resource management, trade, and options.  Cons (for me)- Helicopters, Planes, and Navy fighting.",

But thats the point, the game came with lots of crashes and blackscreen on my rig. I run a highend system with an i7 4790k and a 980ti. Every time I tried to exit the game or it crashes it turned my screen black and forced me to hard reset my computer. I have no problems with other games. Overwatch, BF1, Crysis 3 , Witcher 3 etc...all of them run very good.   I don't know whats the matter but every Bethesda game seems for me kinda uncomplete. They just come with a lot of problems, either if it is Skyrim, Doom or Fallout. Certainly these are amazing games but they simply are bugged as hell. I want to play the game and not search the internet for 2 hours to figure out how I can solve an issue. I requested a refund and I certainly don't think that am gonna give Bethesda another chance.",

I have had a few problems with the launcher but I've had the game before the x-pack came out for it and I am still able to play it just even today. Campaign is quite fun and doesn't feel the same all the time. With the x-pack more options and game play mechanics are more fun to mess with. I have played Anno 2205 and that didn't capture my attention like 2070 did. Free build is always fun to see how much you can squeeze out of your production chains to attain max population it can handle. Definitely recommend (though the launcher does suck) but being on sale during black Friday for $4.99, if you have been eying this game, now would be the time to get it.",
