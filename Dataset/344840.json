    "description": "Have you ever wanted to be admiral of a huge, sprawling space battle-fleet of your own design? Ever wanted to design a fleet of battle-cruisers so powerful they can rip all who oppose them into space-dust? Ever wanted to build a battleship with purple rotating radars and 64 engines? Well we have good news for you...",

            "review_text": "I loved the first game, almost beyond reason and sanity, so I hoped this game at least measured up to the first one. It hasn't, it has surpased it by leaps and bounds. You not only have control over the weapons and gear your ships take to battle, you have the ability to design their apperance. To some this may not be a big deal, but to me it adds a layer of creative fun. The weapons and gear are varied and have an impact on tactics that can be profound when correctly used. The battle commands given prior to launching your fleet are easy to use and familiar to any one who played the first version. One of the major changes is that Dreadnaughts are now part of the standard make up of the game. In the first game you had to download mods and go through the hoops to get them to work right, more about that later. Anyways, dreadnaughts make the game epic in scale that it might otherwise have lacked. There is nothing that says you have to use them, a small scrappy fleet can offer advantages over ponderous ships. There is a great deal of satisfaction though in seeing 3 or 4 heavy dreadnaughts glide through the debries of theri foes. Now, the mods. The first version had a healthy modding community and had tons of fun and crazy stuff. Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, and Star Trek were mod favorites. There was also a ton of mod races that were fresh fromt the mind of their creators. The game was made for mods and it was part of its brilliance. I haven't tried playing around with modding this version yet, but if it is anything like the first game it is sure to get some amazing mods and great DLC expansions.",

            "review_text": "I love this game, despite the fact that it crashes literally every 15 minutes (I can forgive this because it doesn't crash during a fight, and it also loads up super fast, meaning you're back in the game very quickly)  GSB2 is, depending on how you play it, the successor to Battleships Forever, or a fun freeform puzzle game disguised as a shiny battle simulator.  I play it in the first way. The ship designer is far more powerful this time around, with the ability to color and retexture every part (Yes, you can make your ships look like actual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ using textures. Please don't do that. We're all 'mature' 'adults' here) as well as add modules to the game. Rotating bits and bobs, lights that actually flicker and die as the battle goes on, engine glow and contrails, it's a 2D ship designer's dream come true.  I can also play it in the second way, which is as a puzzle game masquerading as a spaceship strategy game. Every fight is a puzzle, and many have unique gimmicks in the form of anomalies. In one battle, the enemy may have a lot of fighters and bombers, so destroyers with tractor beams and anti-fighter lasers are key. In the next battle, tractor beams don't work because of a technobablon particle flux wave, or whatever, so you need to plan accordingly. You can make your own puzzles too, with challenges and custom battles (also a little buggy).   Buy this game.  It's a great game, and knowing Mr. Harris, he's got DLC and expansion packs coming to make it even better. EDIT (No he does not, sadly)",

            "review_text": "So I came across a bug in GSB2. I've noticed a few other minor ones before this, small graphics glitches, ship designs which temporarily disappeared, and such; But nothing which actually prevented me from playing. Until this morning.   I was trying to beat one of the latter scenarios using only frigates or lighter ships. A futile mission perhaps, but that's partly the appeal of the game. Setting a goal and then trying to beat it with the absolute minimum expenditure of resources. This lead to me creating a huge formation of frigates, which seems to have exceeded the maximum that the game would allow. This caused the game to crash whenever I’d try to start the scenario.   I’ve been in this situation before. You submit a bug report and then maybe get a canned email response saying that the problem will be looked into, and then nothing further . You wait months and just hope that there will be a fix in the next patch. Hell, you often just hope that there will BE a next patch.   So how long do you think it took Positech to get this resolved? About 10 minutes. I got a personal response straight from Cliff (the one-man developer of GSB2), got a workaround to the problem and assurance that it’d be fixed in the next patch. That’s a huge indication that this is someone who really cares about their games and will work to make ‘em great.  Unfortunately this experience has left me in an existential crisis and has potentially revealed a serious flaw in my psychological makeup. Years of internet immersion has honed my sarcastic wit to razor sharp perfection. I can be a snarky ♥♥♥-hole at the drop of a hat, spewing smarm and vitriol at anybody who dares to not be perfect on the internet, all from the comfort and anonymity of my bedroom. And I like to think I’m quite a bit better at it than most. But now I find that I need to praise something. To be positive and supportive. My every instinct recoils at the notion.  But why should it. I really like the game. Judging from his lineup of games, Cliff seems to have very similar tastes to my own. Games that don’t rely on twitch skills, but on planning and strategy. Games where you can constantly tweak a bunch of individual small aspects to see how they affect the system as a whole.   And that’s what GSB2 is. If you think that just completing each of the missions is the goal, you can achieve that fairly quickly and with little planning. Just throw more ships at the problem and eventually you’ll win. But the real challenge is trying to do it with as little as possible. I usually start by making a fleet which can win the engagement fairly decisively, and then start whittling it down and tweaking stuff until I think I’ve got it down to the bare minimum. Eventually I get to where I’m sure it’s just not possible to do it with anything less. Then I check the high scores and see that not only do I not have the best score ever, I’m about 50,000 points shy of it. Holy ♥♥♥♥, I’ve got to rethink this whole strategy. This is how this game eats up hours of my life. And it’s time well spent as far as I’m concerned. ",

(they did :P)  edit: after the changes the dev team have made/ are making i am changing this review into a recommended one. It is definitely worth the money now since the patches (which were changes to research and extra levels etc.) i will be spending more time with this game in the near future, because it is really fun and strategic, the art style is awesome and i love the customization. On release day i felt there as little to no reason to edit ships, since normal mode was too easy (for me anyway being familiar with the previous game), but the recent changes give me motivation to spend more time tinkering and figuring out how deep the game really is. I look forward to the future of this game, mod support, dlc etc, have me excited to play more, my only big wish is if somehow there could be a feature to fight randomly generated fleets for more honor, but there'd need to be more stuff to unlock with honor to keep you going in the long run! thank you!",

Essentially the only goal, other then win every scenario is to purchase all the supposed improvements to the ships.. I got the ones I used to complete virtually every fight within the first few fights and then I purchases all the others over my stint of just playing through very easily just to get everything, not even an achievement. The game would crash fairly consitantly however that was offset by the very quick load times and the fact that my ship selection and settings were saved before the crash. I wish all games that crash would crash like this game does.",
