The music is very calming and the concept is very intuitive. The gameplay is fairly good, but I could not seem to figure out how to properly land the ship without making it go on fire... which made this game very difficult. Would be more fun and easier if there was a better way to land (unless I missed something). 6/10",

Anyway, just another cool game from a group of cool people that make cool games.   It also has an awesome ambient soundtrack.   It's easily worth the money. You've spent five bucks on stuff you've enjoyed far less.",
