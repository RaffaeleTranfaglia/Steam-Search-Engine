            "review_text": "It's not very common for a video game to have a totally satisfying and conclusive ending, even more so if it’s a series. The Blackwell games managed to stick the landing completely and Epiphany makes for one of the best conclusions I've ever seen in a video game.  Do yourself a favor and buy the whole series right now and start from the beginning. The series grows and gets better with each installment. Epiphany is just a great culmination of everything that came before it mixing great writing and logical puzzles into an overall fantastic game.   Epiphany has quickly become one of my new favorite games. I also would say that The Blackwell Series as a whole easily rivals the adventure game classics. Fans of the series should buy this game ASAP and for those who haven't played them I reiterate to just buy the whole series now if you're interested, you’re in for a memorable ride. I definitely won't be forgetting it anytime soon.",

And 2 main characters, you will just fall in love with them. Alas the ending of the last game is really hard to accept emotionally. It makes sad. The game gives emotion, will make you feel empathy for main characters. I seriously recommend this saga to anyone who likes old-school, pixelated point'n'click adventure games.",

Becoming homeless is the next logical step.”    Blackwell Epiphany represents the last of five parts in the Blackwell series. The most interesting aspects of these games, next to the excellent storytelling, are the characters and their development.  A suitable example is the female protagonist. At the beginning Rosa’s behavior could be described as awkward and nervous. At the end of her journey she has become a confident woman, who is proud of her special gift.   Overall, the Blackwell saga is a very charming adventure with wonderful characters and great writing.

            "review_text": "You want ending? Blackwell will give you ENDING. The Blackwell Epiphany is the final round of Blackwell adventuring, and they make a point of going out with one, if not several, bangs.  Rosa and Joey are back once more, even more dedicated to their cause following the events of Blackwell Deception and tracking a case that feels a bit heavier than their earlier workload. Things quickly spin into an even more grim situation, where bad times seem contagious and things are steadily getting less and less good, both for our plucky protagonist and, eventually, all of New York City.  Of the entire Blackwell series, I'd say this round's change of sprite art is my favorite, and the portraits are up there in the ranking as well. Puzzles felt a bit easier this time around, but it could just be having gotten used to Blackwell logic after already finishing four other games in the series. There's not much I can say beyond that without spoiling, though I will say you might expect at least one twist if you've been paying attention thus far.",

The Story is astonishing told and has all the ingredients of a really good story. It has emotions, tension, humor and seriousness. The story is really well told and that strong to put this series in a league of one of the best adventures I played the last few years.  About the different aspects of the this Games/Series:   Graphics:  The graphic is no highly polished, effectful 3D grahic, but it is always fitting to tell the story also in appropriate graphical way. The graphics get better with every part of the Blackwell series, but it never takess the attention away from the story.   Blackwell Epiphany: 6/10  Blackwell series: 5/10    Audio:  The Audio is great. Every bit line is sychronized and well played by the different voice actors. This one is really great and support the whole game/series and how emotionally the story is told. The music is atmospehric and is never nerve-racking.   Blackwell Epiphany: 10/10  Blackwell series: 10/10    Story:  I wrote it at the beginning of my review. This is one of the best told stories in an adventure / adventure series in the last few years. It has it all emotions, tension, humor and seriousness. It is well support through the graphic and even better by audio, meaning voice actors and music.   Blackwell Epiphany: 10/10  Blackwell series: 10/10    I can defintely recommend this game... WAIT... I insist I recommend the whole series to get the full experience out of the fantastic story.  This game / series is worth every dime of it. You wil not regret it!   Have fun with this adventure gem(s) :) ",

            "review_text": "It is finally finished! This beloved series that just keeps growing on ya! I'm extremely impressed by the way that Dave Gilbert developed this story. By the end of the whole series I felt very connected to Rosa, Joey, and the cast of characters from the entire series. It is also amazing to see the games improve as they progressed, getting rid of elements that detracted from the game and replacing them with elements that helped push the game along. I'm not much of a mystery/clue finding type of gamer, so if a game series is able to get me to enjoy something that I'm not that into then the game is pretty special. For this fifth and final installment here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.  Pro's: The storyline is marvelous in this game, lets just say everything wraps up rather nicely. I absolutely love Rosa and Joeys relationship and think that the actor who plays Joey does an amazing job and yes the hilarious banter is still there. The puzzles were fun, as usual. I was glad that this game had some different puzzles that the other four games had not done before and the continued ability to switch between Rosa/Joey. The length of the game was good, comparable to Convergence and Deception (Unbound and Legacy both seemed a little short).  Con's: One word, the art. Still hate it and always will! I also think it is funny that I love and hate the consistency issues. I think that making the necessary changes from game to game is a good thing to do, but it really makes you feel like they should have done that in the previous games and can be a little jarring when Joey is drawn different, the style of music changes, the mechanics change, or the voice acting is different.  As I've said in many of the other reviews, some of these games by themselves are not the greatest (cough...Blackwell Legacy), but if you can get through the first boring chapter in the book then you will find a pretty amazing series one that will not disappoint.

The Blackwell series completely surprised me. It had incredibly engaging characters, an intuitive investigation system, and puzzles that are challenging, but not impossible.  All of this comes to a head in this fifth and final entry in the series. Its gameplay time is roughly twice or three times longer than previous games, with a lot room for character, mystery, and puzzle development. The series has improved with each game, whether it was in puzzle design or its interface. Ending the series on such a high note leaves you wishing there was more, but also feeling satisfied by its tear-jerking finale.  Honestly, if you're reading this and thinking of getting it or the series as a whole, I say yes. Absolutely. I say this especially as a fan of adventure games. The Blackwell games are a gem in the sea of adventure games and you're doing yourself a disservice by not playing them.",

It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.  You play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell. Rosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.  Joey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.  A very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.  The Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:  1. The Blackwell Legacy 2. Blackwell Unbound 3. Blackwell Convergence 4. Blackwell Deception 5. Blackwell Epiphany  Be sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.",

The film noir style and mellow humour fits it's mature storyline of psychic and spirit guide investigative mystery solving. This is story-driven adventure not a large pockets inventory fest, and unlike say Daedelic's Deponia, here the puzzles are the story, rather than obstacles to it. So while some might say the game is easier, equally the progression and story flows enjoyably rather than stumbling over so many puzzles you forget the plot. The plot thickens with each instalment so I'd definitely recommend playing the earlier games to enjoy the story and character progression. I'd guess each game in the series takes around 3-5 hours to complete. Though Epiphany definitely seemed the longest game yet, gameplay is around 5 hours, and felt about right.",

But Steam is full of those. So I will just warn you:  It hurts. It HURTS. This game offers one of the best friendships you'd see between two game characters and you can see how they move from meeting and accepting each other (ep1), barely tolerating the fact that they have to be around each other (ep3, which strikes you with the different voice tone Joey uses toward Rosa than Lauren), warming up to and finding qualities they love in each other (ep4), and finally, being fully invested in friendship (but would forever pretend they are only barely standing to each other) in this episode. And the ending happens and you are sad.  The story is so well conducted and ties up perfectly in this episode. I am saying only this about the story because I appreciate it so much that I don't think I'd be able to stop myself from giving spoilers. Of course, writing has its faults then and there, no story is 100% even if you like it enough to feel like it.   And to be honest, I did think the vortex and 'universe superpowers' in this episode were a bit excessive but it pays the price of breaking your heart so that it seems more realistic than if it didn't have consequences.   All I can say about the storyline without giving spoilers is that it's good and worth your time.  But beware if you get attached to the characters, and if you are really into story-rich games and can see what meaning lies underneath things said and done - you WILL get attached to the characters if you like the game, you will be hurt.

You don't have to spend as much time figuring out what to search for in the browser on Rosa's phone, which is a relief.

            "review_text": "Short Version: A confident, modern update of the mid-90s adventure game. An excellent conclusion to a series that started good and kept getting better. Story impact is far greater having played the previous four games and I'd recommend starting from the first game instead of jumping in at the end for this game to have fullest impact. A few puzzles with obscure or finicky methods to solve them, uneven voice acting among the supporting cast prevent this from being the perfect adventure game but those are minor quibbles regarding a game that is a minor masterpiece of the genre. Definitely recommend the game.  Long Version: Before adventure games got cool again, with Telltale's increasing mastery of the genre and updates of older classics like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, the Blackwell series was keeping the point-and-click adventure genre alive. There are five games in the Blackwell series, and you can track the increasing competence of Wadjet Eye Games in terms of art direction, vocal direction and storytelling across each game in the series. There is a practiced confidence that enters the series - not arrogance, but confidence borne of learning the lesson taught by each game and applying it to the next game in the series.  By Blackwell Epiphany, the series has reached its apex. But for it to have maximum impact, playing the previous games are crucial. Sure, I think you can come into the series with this game and get a lot out of it. But when you've been playing as Rosangela and Joey for four previous games, everything in this game resonates so much more. The final outcome of these two people (well, one person and one ghost) has so much more weight. And boy, does it have weight. The stakes in each game of the series have increased, and Blackwell Epiphany takes the stakes the highest they ever have gone. I won't spoil it for you - normally, spoilers aren't such a big deal but with a story heavy game I'll be safe instead of sorry - but it manages to be big, Hollywood movie big stakes, without feeling empty and cheap. It's a real credit to the world they've created.  The game's not perfect. It's an adventure game so there's a few 'guide dang it' moments where it's not entirely clear what the next thing to do is. However, like most of the series, Blackwell Epiphany avoids the pixel-hunt trap and the solutions are not obtuse to the point of ridiculousness. The voice acting can be slightly uneven, which has been a bane of the series (and Wadjet Eye Games in general, I've found) but Rosangela and Joey's voice actors are excellent and really understand their characters well, and they're the two you'll be hearing the most. As mentioned, it's probably the best voice acting in the series thus far. The art direction is good - it's achieving the standards set by the Lucasarts games of the 90s they lovingly emulate with crisper textures you'd expect from a modern game. That said, the series does not achieve the level of graphical polish that we've been seeing with modern adventure games like Telltale's games or Life is Strange. It's a retro experience, the heir to Lucasarts gaming instead of the characterization-heavy modern offshoot. Whether that's good, bad or simply different is up to you.  In the end, I absolutely recommend this game if you like adventure games. I do say that it is worth it to go back and play the series front to end instead of playing this game without having played the others. You *can* do it, but you'll lose something wonderful - the sense of wrapping up a fulfilling story with a couple of old friends you've seen change and grow. You just can't get that playing this game alone.  Nota bene: You'll notice I don't own the previous games in my library but talk about the entire series. The previous four games I purchased through  GOG.com . This brings up a good point, too - there's nothing that transfers over from game to game. No 'big choice' moments that carry over from previous games. Which makes it easy to jump into the series later and not 'miss' anything, unlike say the Mass Effect series, but my recommendation to play the others first still stands.",

I was kinda hoping Tomo would be explained in this one, but oh well.   This one I felt was a bit longer than the last one, but I could have just been slower to the uptake in this one. If you haven't played any of the Blackwell games, I would skip this one until you do. If you're in the mood for a good point and click that's not short, I definitely recommend this one!",

All Blackwell games are well polished and comfortably playable despite the retro look. If you never played those series try starting with the retrospecting 'Blackwell Unbound' for an extra thrill when seeing the intro of 'Blackwell Legacy'.",
