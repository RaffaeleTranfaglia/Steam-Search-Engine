Just save your time and just play quake live or any of the f2p shooters basically.   You can buy all in game premium and items with in game currency. I didn't play long enough to figure out if classes were behind a permanent paywall(It appears so although no wiki to confirm that I could find). So you can take a pick between p2w or grind2win as upgrades are just straight upgrades in the shop. It's a mystery how so many can take time to not just either copy a good f2p model or put minimal thought into them.",

The game is free and the game works smoothly (Not like Batla (a.k.a Altab)). I mean, who bothers to make a name by reversing Altab? That's incredibly lazy. Why could be like Toy Warfare? I say that's a better name and I came up with that within 10 seconds. If you really want to play this game, make a private game and invite your friends. I had a whale of a time with my other friend (Yes, only one friend and I had the time of my life playing with him. Want to know why? Because it was FAIR) I rate the game 3/10. Needs more improvements before it can be a game worth the time. But for now, stay clear of this game. Such a bad example for Steam.",
