The game is so unbalanced there's no multiplayer support tho so if you don't like single player stay away. It's very similar to RA3 but it feels rushed and very basic.

I was a fan of Command&amp;Conquer games since like 2009, especially the Red Alert series. It's a relief to have this game after playing hundreds and hundreds of hours of Red Alert 3 with the same ol' s**t, where Kirov's, Twinbaldes, Mirage Tanks, Athena cannons and Shogun's can always win you the game. Now, with the Giga's and Harbingers the enemy can pretty much wreck you if you let them build some. Also the Challenge mode and the Yuriko story is really fun, though short. Sadly no multiplayer though. Overall, great addition to Red Alert 3. Although if you haven't played Red Alert 3 and wanna buy this game, you probably won't know what the f*ck's going on. :)",

            "review_text": "Tutorial to how to make RA3 - Uprising. Step 1: finish developing RA3, one of the most ambitious RTSes of 2008. Step 2: take all your assets, ideas that couldn't fit in the original game or haven't made the deadline and put them together. Step 3: craft a really lame and superficial campaign for each fraction as a wrap-around. Step 4: add Yuriko to the mix. Thus, Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert 3 - Uprising has been born.  Uprising isn't a bad game. However, it wants to do so many thing at once that it can't achieve a single one of them (well, except one: Yuriko). All three factions got a new mini-campaign which takes place after the original game with the Allies winning the war over the Soviets and the Empire. None of the stories are overlapping this time like they were in the original game. There are 10 levels for the three factions combined and all of them are hard as hell. Even on medium difficulty you will be constantly attacked by the enemy on land, water and in the air. Sometimes the game gets so difficult that it will be annoyingly frustrating. Some levels may require over 1-2 hours to complete on medium and not because they are so long, but because you have to retry constantly.   The basic gameplay structure hasn't changed, but some new units were introduced on all 3 sides. Some of them are really unconventional and they can upset your good ol' strategies. The building system remained the same, but less than half of the stages start with base building. On most of them you start off with a smaller group and you have to complete some tasks before HQ can send you an MCV. These commando missions are fresh at first but they very quickly became annoying...for all the players crying out loud: just give us a base and let us build an army! We don't want to play commando with conscripts and attack dogs against tanks and robots! This and the annoying difficulty will make you believe that the creators used these cheap tricks to make the game last longer. Even though it will last longer, they will remain cheap tricks.  On the visual side the game looks great. Water movement is excellent, explosions are beautiful and devastating. You just can't get enough of a dozen Apocalypse Tank annihilating the enemy base. Splendid! Anyone who has seen a Red Alert game knows that its' cutscenes are performed by flesh and blood human actors and actresses. Also anyone can tell that these cutscenes are missing one thing only and that is good acting. The actors are still unconvincing and disbelieving, not that the words that were put into their mouths are any better. Sometimes you just wish the next cut-scene will be a lot shorter and without any speech at all. The debrief ladies look hot though and the short skirt of that Gemma Atkinson's won't disappoint you.  When you finish the campaigns you can try the most innovative and fun part of the game. Yuriko's mini-campaign. She is a psyche with mental powers capable of devastating armies. You have access to 4 powers at one time. After using a power you have to wait for the cooldown time. You can brainwash enemies to fight on your side, create black holes that suck everything inside or simply heal yourself with her powers. This game mode is really interesting, intriguing and its the greatest fun you can find in this game.  When you are done with the mini-campaigns you can play Skirmish, where nothing has changed from the original or play Challenge missions which are actually a lot like Skirmish maps only with cutscenes and a limited arsenal. When you beat a challenge new ones will appear and by beating them you can unlock new units to fight with. Before starting a map you can always select your fraction. It's nothing groundbreaking but thanks to the limited arsenal and gameplay tweaks this game mode can engage lots of players. And finally, there is the multiplayer...oh...wait...there aren't any MP or Co-op modes in this game! No MP in an RTS game. Well played EA, just well played!  Rating: 57/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 10-12 hours; Played on: medium/easy.",

No big boobs plan as RA3 which was bad... but this one is worst proposing just nothing at all. Videos are empty, short and boring. Interresting caracters don't appear in videos, you are stuck with *second level actors* (sidekicks) lieutenants. Forget Tim Curry, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Stormare, *God* George Takei and J.K. Simmons. :(  They added a gameplay called 'Commander's Challenge' which it's just a challenge mode that you must do under the part time. This add few hours of gameplay but doesn't fix for the short plain campaign mode. You become better just learning the scenario and try again... turn to be a boring type of gameplay for me.  And the game do not contains any multiplayer mode! You have skirmish if you want to try few sandbox.  I get tired of this game before be able to complete it.
