            "review_text": "This game is pretty awesome, once you get down the basics that is of course. This Game is special, not in the bad way, This game has calm chilled music, but sadly not enough of that. Though i do hope that there will be more music later on (As Far As i know there are 7 Songs according to the Bandcamp album that is) but if not it's not too big of a problem, even though the music could get annoying after a while. Now for the Game mechanics. This game is basically a movement based game where you move around as a Pixel with a Grappling hook, while trying to earn Points. How to do that? Well just don't touch the Walls and stay fast to get a lot of points for collecting the Red bars that raise the longer you stay away from the Walls. It is hard though to get speed though (found a good way for myself for now). And Thats it for the Mechanics. So This game is a 7/10 in my opinion, mainly because there is not enough music to it. And i would really like to see a Scoreboard in future Updates to compare the Points to my Friends (and a way to save the points too that is). If there is a Scoreboard i am sorry and i did not see it.  TL;DR: Game is a 7/10,  Needs more Music. Fun to Play though. Go and Play it, Gets Addicting really fast.  I'll excuse myself for any Grammar and spelling errors since English is not my Main Language.",

The game is free, and it's only an 11MB download, which means you could have finished downloading it by the time you've finished reading this review.  The game presents itself in such a way you don't want to let go. You're this Spiderman-esque dot, swinging around by clicking in the direction of different blocks, throwing yourself into these lines. Once you go through them, it adds to your points score which offers no reward in itself, other than some sort of milky satisfaction for completionists.  It's hard to criticise a game that presents itself so lovely, and the fact it's free makes it hard to refuse. But unlike, for example Angry Birds, there is no sense of progression, and can get bored very quickly. Each level you move on to is just random block placement. I believe that lack of goal is what makes Floating Point what it is - it doesn't dress itself up, and there's no penalty for whatever.  It's a lovely game, but it personally isn't for me. It is very peaceful and relaxing, which some may find as a stress relief - which I imagine makes this someone's perfect cup of tea. Sadly, I prefer coffee. But I find myself firing this up now and then for some relaxation, and Floating Point works a treat.",

        {
            "review_text": "It's a fun little game where you shoot a grappling hook at blocks and swing between other blocks to collect red beacons.  Each level is identicle in it's aesthetic and objectives and offers no variation. There isn't much to it. But what there is, it does really well.  The swinging is responsive and if you practice enough, allows you to completely avoid every obsticle, giving you maximum points. There are 2 areas, air and water. In the air, gravity pulls you down. In the water, buoyancy pushes you up. This forces you to be able to switch your swinging techniques as you fling yourself between the 2.  This game rewards good players. The beacons that must be collected grow when you move quickly without hitting obsticles, and shrink when you crash or slow down. This means that if you're not good at the game, the game becomes more difficult just to rub it in. This, however, is not a criticism. Too many games are letting the bad player get off too easy these days.  That said, this game is not challenging. Then again, it's not supposed to be. As is written above in the 'About the Game' section, Floating Point is a 'peaceful game'. There is no failure state, no time, and when you beat a level, you can spend the next hour drawing squiggly lines and patterns.  It's a small, but fun game, with a great, yet simplistic artstyle, calming music and enjoyable swinging mechanics.",

This game is surprising relaxing, casual and amazing experience to play. Got a spare 5 mins before work, school, or even football training? Just launch Floating Point. Playing this game for ten minutes feels like 30, and it is all so rewarding when you can swing yourself across the level at a hundred miles per hour and get that last beam of light to unlock all the traces of where you have been. Once you complete a level and press enter you transfor yourself, a little ball thing, into the background of the previous level. The music is so relaxing and vibrant, and I love how the sound of it gets 'distorted' when you go under water. When you go under water you lose a lot of momentum and it's a lot harder to get in the water then above the water. Another thing about the water is that you float in it, so it's very hard to get far enough to get those deep level beams of light you need to travel through. The aim of the game is to pretty much fly through these red beams of light (which also get shorter if you hit a wall) and progress through many levels. In all this is a MUST download (as it's a free game), so what are you waiting for? It's only about 54 MB and it's free! Get it before they put a pricetag on this wonderful creation of a game! =D",

After about 30 mins of play, you'll be swinging better than Spider-Man ever did and you'll feel great nailing pinpoint moves. A superb game, ideal for those lazy Sundays with nothing else to do; put on this game and have a casual swing-about, and all of a sudden your time is gone. Learn the ropes and you'll be sucked in to what is one of the most beatiful games I've played in a while. Oh, and it's free.",

After jumping in, the concept may take some getting used to -- but, once you get the hang of it, your actions feel much less random and pointless (something like button-mashing), and once you get good at it, it's anything but boring.   Sooner or later you'll figure out how the scoring system works, and you'll really be pushing to beat your high score which can be especially frustrating with how slow the ball moves. However, that doesn't matter, because this game offers settings that allow you to change the values of the game properties (the strengths of retraction, block density, etc.). Every time I found something I didn't like about this game, there was some way around that catered to my personal preference. There are a number of little extra things you'll run into that will leave you thinking, 'oh, hey, that's kinda cool!'  Yup yup, obviously I recommend this game.

The art design is sleek, minimalist but looks fantastic, and it interacts very well with the music through the 2 'areas' of the map (Air and Water I'm assuming?). All in all, it's a good game, considering it's free.

This is perfect for when your looking through your library, (Steam, X-Box, Wii, ect.) and you just don't know what to play. This is also an icredibly simple game, in terms of controls and consept. The music is also something to praise. Being a musician myself, I find it nothing special by technicallity, by it fits the game's concept so well. The game is also easy one the eyes, by which I mean you could play it in the dark and still bareilly stress your eyes.     All around, an awesome game!",

            "review_text": "Floating point is a very good swing em up (Thats what I call games like this) that allows you to swing around all over the place without a care in the world. And for a free game, HOT DAMN IS IT GOOD. So the preimise of this game is that you swing around on diffrent blocks in order to collect red bars and as far as I can tell if you hit the blocks or lose momentom, they go down. I dont know if them going down counts to your points. Now bellow you there is water, and the water makes it so you need momentom to swing you down into it and get the bars below. If you dont have momentom you rise out of the water. Now if your good you can keep a steady motion and collect all the bars without touching any of the black boxes which I cant do, but if you can, good on yah. Now when you collect all the bars your dot turns white and you can swing around freely, but the the bars in the background either increses or decreses. Now you can press space bar to go to the next area in the background and do the same thing again execpt try to get a better score. Every floor (Thats what I call it.) resets your score so you have to try to get a better one.   Section 2: Tricks. A fun little trick is to wrap your grapling rope around a block so that you do circles around that block and eventually launch super fast. This is useful if you want to get down into the water.    Section 3: Recomendation. Well, what can I say? First off a free game never hurts and seccond, its just plain fun! If the simple and calming gameplay doesnt hook you than the nice soundtrack will. If im ever mad its nice to sit down and play some of this game to calm me down, and I reccomend you do the same.     Section End: Rating. This game is definitly one of the better free games I've played that doesn't say: Hey you! Yes you there! Do you want to play a free game full of microtransactions that ultimitly make you feel like your progressing but you really arent? Then take a look at 'Insert clash of clans rip off that is exactly like the other game and is crap because the base game is crap'. So yeah, a solid 10/10. (Extra point because its free.)",

You are content.  - You quickly get a hang of the controls and score a few points sailing gracefully across the map. You are entertained.  - You hookshot repeatedly for many minutes and reach incredible speeds, trying to set up the perfect path, then collide with a platform by a millimeter, slow to a crawl, and sigh audibly before resigning to try all over again. You are determined.  - You finally punch the air as you watch yourself sail majestically through space, blasting through gates with incredible precision and racking up hundreds of thousands of points. You are ecstatic.  - You check the score thread and discover someone casually hit a few million in the time it took you to hit one gate, but you don't care because the gameplay is smooth as butter, the ambient sountrack is relaxing, and you can watch back your beutifully intricate, criss-crossed kaleidoscope of trails for eternity. You are addicted.",
