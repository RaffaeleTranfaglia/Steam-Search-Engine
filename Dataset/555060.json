            "review_text": "  Final Goalie: Football Simulator: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Well here I am, a 40 year-old frog, somewhat vertically challenged but a massive fan of Football. Sorry guys, I have to do this. . . GO THE GUNNERS - ARSENAL all the way! I must admit I feel great now! Anyhow, if you are like me and have always dreamed of keeping a clean sheet for your team, it’s time to show your hidden skills in Final Goalie: Football Simulator!  Final Goalie: Simulator is a VR/ Sport simulation game where you take control of the next greatest goal keeper of all time. Your mission is to make sure no balls get past you and into the net.  The game has a few modes of play: a story, an arcade, a simulator and a multiplayer mode.   The Story mode consist of country (or continent) cups with challenges. As an example, you might face the Iraq team and your challenge could be to stop all balls with your right hand without conceding a goal to win the Golden Cup. The simulator mode is pretty much the same as the story mode, with you facing a team and if you succeed at the challenge, you start again. Pretty much a practice run I guess. I have not been able to try the multiplayer mode at this stage but I am looking forward to it, to be honest with you. The arcade mode is truly the best mode of the game in my opinion. It is a very similar layout to the story mode but instead of facing a team, you will be against a set of canons which will shoot footballs (no kidding), bombs (no kidding either), beach balls (what else), tennis balls (if you unlock the unfortunate tennis ball icon, pretty much game over) and achieve the set challenge.   For the game play side of it, the arcade is the most fun in this game. You might find it a bit repetitive in the story and simulator mode. However, it is not that easy when one of your opponents shoots a cracker of a kick at you! 7 out of 10 - I could not save it; the ball was traveling too fast!   Graphically, Final Goalie is really well done and I am sure you will enjoy the stadium atmosphere as much as I did.  Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Good Graphics and animations - Several game modes - 150 levels to beat - Trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - No achievements - A bit repetitive   A solid Goalkeeper simulation in my opinion!  7/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
