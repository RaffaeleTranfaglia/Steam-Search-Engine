However, instead of updating THIS, he gave it a new name and released it separately (Under a new name) to try and slime more money. Thus, this is officially abandoned.  Nice.   That's a big F-you to all that bought this game.",

            "review_text": "I recommend it but only if you can get it at a low enough price as there are still a few annoying bugs. It's a borderline recommendation though as the crafting mechanics and rover repairs become tedious quite quickly .  Also it will probably only appeal to a certain type of person so you should play the demo first.  The good: It's a slow paced survival game that does a reasonable job of capturing some of what it would be like to live and try and survive on Mars. A very unique survival experience that doesn't rely on zombies/dinos or some other form of being horribly murdered to create the survival expereience.  The Bad: There are some bugs, the most annoying I encountered was when my dirt sample and drill samples stopped being recorded. The gameplay is a little dry. Most of the time it consists of waiting for a green bar to fill. Which mostly works accept for the fabrication benches and the constant rover repairs. Which push it too far and it feels like needless time wasting instead of a gameplay abstraction. The science is a little iffy in places. I'm not sure what's the point of the worms or mushrooms as you can only grow them once and I presume the worms would be part of the compost system and not kept seperately. Then there are the fish which seem to be the food eqivalent of a perpetual motion machine. I don't know if the worms, mushrooms, and fish were meant to be more fleshed out, but the gamedev ran out of time or what.  Processing of minerals seems out of place to the rest of the game in that it magically happens inside a machine. When all the other machines use equipment modules and are based on reality. In fact along with crafting chemical extraction/seperation could of made for interesting gameplay if it was more fleshed out, maybe with a puzzle element.",

Also, the textures used are bland and 'flat' as shown in the screenshots (as of 6/14/2014). As it stands, it doesn't offer a whole lot. I'm hopeful that with more work done with this title that I will be wrong and would enjoy this more.",

The other two bases are not really worth doing since they have the same goals in different terrains. After I finished, I feel like I had just done a demo though! This game could have so much more! Actual base crafting, emergencies (metoros, solar storms...), trading with other bases.... Would love to see some DLC or community mods. ",

The game has no excitement what so ever [which that is not a issue for some] The game seems to be buggy. And most of all theres so little to do exept waltz around and place this here and that there.  Untill these issues are fixed it's unreccomendable to purchase. Might as well get Aliens vs Predator instead.",

This game wasn't amazing when I first got it sure it was fun for a short time but when you need to stare at the in game guide for every little problem it gets old fast. When I first got it I had no problem but on recent re downloading both Nortons and McAfee showed that the .exe is a trojan making it near impossible for me to run without red flags everywhere. Could just be me but having two sources of antivirus software saying it is a trojan I suggest skipping it for one of the many other games that you can buy for 5 dollars.",
