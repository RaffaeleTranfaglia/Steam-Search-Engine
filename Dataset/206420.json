The story is awesome, the combat is really fun, and there is so much customization in this game.  Pros: - Lots of little gamemodes to play, and the story is fun. - Loads of insane weapons to use, from assault rifles to black hole guns. - Lots of customization - Just about every part of the game can be done in Co-op - So many awesome super powers!  Cons: - Random crashes when using high graphical settings and sometimes in Co-op - FPS can be low in cutscenes  The communication in multiplayer could be a bit better. When you want to speak to someone through text chat, it links you through to chat with them on the steam chat. Often it says the person is offline, even though you are playing with them. And if you go on their profile, it says they are playing Saints Row IV. The only way you can really talk to people through text is to either talk in the comments section on their profile (which isn't a good idea) or send them a friend request, but that's if they actually accept it. You can only really use mic to talk, which I don't tend to use.  But nevertheless,  in my honest opinion, I give it a 9/10 :D",

Get it for a sale and you'll have a good time with it, but as a huge fan of the Saints Row franchise I felt like this one was rushed out, repetitive, and had all the hallmarks of a studio cash grab.

            "review_text": "  -Quick Review-   Saints Row IV is an Open World Action world, which a delightful mix of humor and drama, the game starts out playing as a third person shooter, and then switches over to feeling like you're playing a super hero game. I've actually been putting off writing this review because I've been having so much fun playing through the game a second time. That should speak volumes for itself.   -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  'Greetings Mr./Ms. President your immediate attention is needed regarding the problems of ruling the entire United Sates.' *Zap zap zap*' *Gasp*  who are you?'  We are the Zin and we come in peace.  'Really? you just killed three of our secret agents and ruined the press conference'   psych!  *pew pew pew* I don't want to give anything away specific about the story, simply put your crew has been abducted by aliens and it's your job to save them and bring down Zinyak to save the human race. The story is full of humor, I found myself laughing aloud at the countless references and the ways these characters interacted with each other.   Game Play:  As you play through the game you unlock various 'super powers', from sprinting, to running, to firing ice, telekinesis, or ground stomp. The super powers flow seamlessly with the story, and genuinely make game play pleasurable to experience. In addition to super powers, you also have various weapons that you can use, my personal favorite was the energy-sword (of course), but you had guns, hand to hand combat, laser guns, regular guns, rocket launchers, and many alien weapons that get unlocked as you play through the game.    Achievements:  The achievements on this game are broken down into four categories: 1) Main story achievements. 2) doing all the things, and probably missed the first time through achievements. 3) DLC achievements.  4) Broken achievement  1) As the title implies most of the main story achievements you get just by playing through, you will get close to 10-15 achievements just playing through. 2) The achievements I ended up missing were a few grinding achievements that I could do at the end of the game, in addition to doing the side missions AFTER the last boss... so I need to play through the whole game again. (normally this would be immensely annoying for me, but this game is definitely fun a second time through) 3) You need to buy the DLC, and I don't own it at the moment.   4) I'm highlighting this because if you want to get 100% for this game, it is impossible at this time (2/6/2015) because one achievement requires you to connect to  saintsrow.com , and there was a recent shut down for the provider of that service, so you can no longer upload a character from in the game (or log on within the Saints Row IV Client, for that matter).  I was able to successful log into my saints row account and upload a character on 09/27/15.    Price:  The standalone version without any DLC is priced at $19.99, that is a fair price based on the amount of time I've personally put into the game, and this is a game that can be replayed and enjoyed again, If you already know you like the saints row series, you should probably go for a Game of the Century Edition, or Ultimate Franchise Pack.  As always, waiting for a sale is most beneficial to your pocket book, but this game is totally worth every dollar.     Conclusion:  This game is going on my top list for favorite games I've played, I've also learned how to identify some qualities in games that I tend to really enjoy playing, from playing Saints Row IV. To quickly recap, The story was hilarious, and entertaining, the game play was excellent, The achievements were great except for the broken achievement, the price is fair. This game appeals to most people, but especially people who enjoy open world games. I should add one comment regarding tech requirements, the game came out in 2013, so it was rough on my personal computer, I tried troubleshooting, but in the end just kept playing, even though the game crashed occasionally. ----Still love the game.  ------Edits and updates------ Edit/Update January 10, 2015: Here's the URL to see my review for  Saints Row IV: How the Saints Save Christmas  Edit/Update February 26, 2015: Here's the URL to see my review for  Saints Row IV - Enter The Dominatrix  Edit/Update April 17, 2015: Here's the URL to see my review for  Saints Row: The Third   Edit/Update September 27, 2015: Broken achievement fixed.",

However I started with the second game and was amazed at an actual fantastic story about gang violence and the ups and downs of the crime life. It was fantastic with great fun gameplay and exciting mission variety. The third was a turn in the direction of nonsensical sillyness. The fourth continues on this trend much to some chagrines, I personally think its refreshing. I love a game that knows its not taking itself seriously and is just meant to be fun and over the top. The funny thing is this is the best 'super power' game out there. This game is fantastic and even better with the fully drop in drop out coop with a friend. You can play every second of this game all the missions everything with a friend. Its a fantastic coop experiance. If you and your friend like screwing around in a virtual world THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! This game is pure rediculous fun. Its a game where the devs did not forget to make their game fun. So if you like fun, buy this game. 9/10 AMAZING COOP",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I binged through this game in about 5 days' time because of sleeping troubles. Some of the following may not apply if you play this at a sane rate.  A huge amount of how you feel about SR4 is probably going to relate to how you felt about SR3, because not-really-a-spoiler: your open world is 99% Steelport again. (There are minor changes.) Even being given extra time after the implosion of former publisher THQ, this game was clearly originally an expansion, and some parts of it really show that corner-cutting when you play through it. On the plus side, though - some of the reuse is done in actual clever ways, and this is where I come to my huge divide about the game: the gameplay gets really, really tired at times, but the writing is pretty sharp.  This game was a pretty clear sendoff/love letter to the franchise, going as far back as SR1 and a whole lot of nods to the earlier titles the further you go along. In fact, probably the entire back half of the game* is winking fanservice to SR1/2 and the stuff that 3 dropped a lot of. Let me point out: none of it is what I'd call 'half-♥♥♥♥♥', either. They seriously got the original VAs from these games to replay their roles, made entire mini-arcs for them, and added optional content to the point of letting you recruit some deep cut characters. Or, if you buy the 'complete' edition with DLCs - just plain cut characters.  I could go on and make a huge list of the ups and downs of this, but basically, do you want to run around a virtual world as a superpowered god, causing mayhem and comedy in your wake? That's this game. It's a superpowered ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  I will give one handy tip, though: upgrade the alien weapons, no matter whether you like them or not. You're going to be stuck with them on more than one mission. Don't get shafted like I was and enter some of the late-game stuff with level 0 guns doing piddly damage.  (Side-note: if you're like me and really dig sites like The Cutting Room Floor and exploration of dummied-out/cut/scrapped content from games, you really owe it to yourself to buy the Enter the Dominatrix DLC, which is basically an extended look at what the original scope of this game was going to be when it was just an SR3 expansion, complete with commentary.)  * Note: back half of the game also consists of a lot of stellar burns on Mass Effect.",

            "review_text": "After playing Saints Row IV for just over fifteen hours, beating the campaign, and enjoying a few side missions along the way, I have noticed vast improvements throughout the series.  Customization:  As most of you should know, customization is key in games such as Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto, and other sandbox games along these lines. Games in the Saints Row franchise have all had some sort of deep customization. Players can create exact replicas of themselves, or even turn into whatever they desire. Although in this addition to the series, we are not left disappointed. The possibilities are endless. Would you like to go around shooting people with Dual Wielded SMGs? You can do that! Want to shoot up a store with Han Solo's signature blaster? You can do that too! Whatever you sick little mind can come up with; you can do it.  Gameplay: Looking back at Saints Row: The Third, you'll definitely notice how many of the activities have reappeared. Some of your favorites such as Tank Mayhem and Insurance Fraud. Although, in this addition to the franchise, the activities have gotten far more challenging; giving the player a harder time and not making the game drift away so quickly. For example, when you're ragdolling your character around the city in Insurance Fraud, you'll need to gain a certain amount of money to either earn Bronze, Silver, or Gold!  City Upgrades: If you've played any of the other Saints Row games, you've probably noticed the lack of aerial combat. That has changed completely in Saints Row IV. When the developers added the VTOL hover-jets and rocket cycles, it just makes the game feel that much more entertaining. We've also seen improvements on the vertical areas of Stilwater, it's far easier to throw yourself off the top of a building to a quick and easy death. That is, only if you don't have your superpowers activated ;)  Removal of Importance: Remember in the previous Saints Row games when you had to earn 'respect' from your crew and gang? They've removed that and simply changed it's name to XP. While this makes sense due to the scenerios and there only being about nine humans technically alive. It still makes the game feel a little less like the classic 'Saints Row' style game.  Cars and Music: Basically since this game takes place almost entirely inside a computer simulation, you can do some pretty awesome things. One of them being that you can hijack a car and then 'upload' it into your virtual garage. Later on, you can simply 'download' it to wherever you may be on the map. It's pretty much the same as the cars, but now you can play music wherever you may be. Yes, you read that correctly. You don't even need to be in a car! This adds a whole new level of excitement to the game, and makes it much more enjoyable.  Overall: Overall, this game was fun to play through and gave me plenty of time driving around and killing ferocious aliens. Although it kind of seems like a let down, it feels just like a large expansion to Saints Row: The Third. It's the end of 2016 and I still recommend it, as it has a unique story and will give you many laughs along the way!",

            "review_text": "       Field     Rating     Comments         Graphics    8.0   Graphically, this isn't all that much of a step up from the last entry. While they aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination, they leave a little bit to be desired considering it's the same engine, same city, and mostly the same characters and vehicles.        Soundtrack    7.5   The music on the radio stations, while not bad, leaves a lot to be desired. After the amazing soundtracks of Saints Row: The Third and Saints Row 2, I feel as if we should have expected more from this one. All-in-all though, still a pretty good, not so bad soundtrack.        Sound Effects    8.5   The sound effects throughout the game range from disappointing to absolutely perfect. A lot of the lower tier weapons (mostly the ones you are more likely to find in the real world) lack any kind of real umph, making them feel weaker than I feel they were intended to be. The more creative weapons, however, generally get me excited at the very thought of pulling them out. There is no joy like unleashing the power of the Dubstep Cannon.        Story    9.0   As Saints Row has shown with its previous installment, it pulls no punches as far as going as ridiculous as they can possibly go. As the newly elected President, it is your job to save the world from an oncoming alien invasion, getting abducted and sent into a Matrix-like simulation of the city from the third game. The main difference is that, since it is no longer grounded by the rules of reality, you can now develop superpowers as you progress through the game's story and side missions. While remaining silly and over the top throughout, Saints Row IV still manages to keep you attached to the characters, keeping small quirks and emotional moments right where they need to be. The only major complaint that I had with this story is   when you do reach the end of the game, the ending boss fight leaves a lot to be desired, and the bad guy is not in the game nearly as much as he should be.          Overall     8.25    While I'll admit I was a little bit disappointed to see that this game took place in the same city as the last game, the new abilities really gave the game a face lift for me. It still packs the hilarious punch of the last game and provides you with something all together new to do. If you're looking for a game like Grand Theft Auto or the first three Saints Row games, honestly, I'd keep looking, but if you are a fan of the series and don't mind a more Prototype-like experience, I would highly recommend this one.  You can skip on most of the DLC though, it's mostly pretty disappointing.     ",

            "review_text": "Being the fourth in the series, Saints Row 4 has a rich backstory and large cast of characters that are constantly referenced throughout the game. I only played parts 3 and 4, so I recognized about 3/4 of the characters in the game. For those unfamiliar, the Saints Row franchise seems to be a parody of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, but I can’t say for sure, since I haven’t played any of the GTA games.   Short recap of Saints Row the Third (the previous game): The Third Street Saints (a street gang) have become world famous pop culture icons despite being a bunch of criminals. They have their own TV shows, sports drink, and people want to grow up to be like them. Unfortunately, a large and powerful crime Syndicate has come to town to destroy the Saints and take over the city. And that’s not all. The US Military (or some kind of military unit) has been dispatched to deal with the Saints as well, with access to some very high tech equipment.  In Saints Row 4, after saving the world from the villains in SR3, the Boss of the Saints (you) has been elected President of the United States. Things are going great up until an alien invasion devastates the planet and kidnaps a bunch of humans to be locked in a computer simulation (basically the Matrix). You discover that by causing mayhem and absorbing “code” in the simulation, you can acquire super powers such as super running speed, super jumping , and later on, energy blasts/telekinesis/super stomps. These abilities, mixed with an arsenal of weapons (human and alien) can be used to trash the game world and try to bring the whole system down. Most of Saints Row 4 takes place in the computer simulation, but there are segments where you’re in the “real world” as well. In the real world you can interact with rescued team members (with a romance system) and pilot an alien space ship around.  Like its predecessors, Saints Row 4 is a third person shooter with a large city you can walk, drive, or fly through. Weapons are bought and upgraded in gun shops found all over the city along with clothing stores (for character customization) and car shops. The city is filled with various activities and missions that you can start by just walking up and pressing a key. These include Mayhem (Blow up as much as you can with the weapons given to you in a time limit), Racing, and Insurance Fraud (you ragdoll around being hit by cars to rack up a huge medical bill). With the addition of super powers, there’s a lot more variety than in the previous games, but it really makes cars and even planes obsolete since you can run/super jump faster than any vehicle.   There are also a large number of collectibles in the game such as data clusters (used to upgrade your powers) and Audio Logs, which are short recorded messages giving you backstory. I thought it would be impossible to collect them all for the Steam achievement but on my second playthrough it looks like I might actually do it. This is because your game map is much more detailed than I realized, and after a particular upgrade, you will be able to see all the collectibles on your map (kind of like the Batman Arkham games but without puzzles blocking you). By the way I should probably note that the achievements in SR4 are for a single playthrough. You can’t play through the game 10 times and think everything will add up to the achievement goal. For example you actually have to kill 1000 aliens with your superpowers in one playthrough. This means grinding is necessary on a few of the achievements.  Pros: +A lot of humor in the game with its over the top story and characters. The game is definitely a parody with silly names and crazy missions. +A lot of variety in gameplay. There’s everything from side scrolling 2-D fighting, to tank/mech battles, to fighting Godzilla size monsters. Remember that the game world is a computer simulation so they can do just about anything they want. +The story is decent and the game is pretty long so you should get your money’s worth. It also has a co-op mode which I haven’t tried. It seems to be its own save file though, independent of your single player campaign.  Cons: -You’ll notice that there is a lot of repetition in the game despite the variety of activities you can take part in. Most of the side quests are the same (Do a series of mini-games). You can bypass them of course, but you’d miss out on unlocking upgrades to your superpowers. -Some of the Steam achievements seem like they would take forever to complete such as “complete ALL challenges” (challenges are like in game achievements). No doubt I could do them eventually, but it would take an extra 50 hours of gameplay. And remember it needs to be in a single playthrough. Also, a bunch of achievements are for the game’s DLCs which I don’t own.  Overall, the game is worth playing if you can get your hands on it. Steam had a free weekend a while back and I know a couple people who finished the game during the 3 days. The price hasn’t quite dropped to “bargain bin” level though it’s on sale occasionally. I’ve heard some people say the game is like a DLC for Saints Row the Third, and I can see what they mean. The graphics are nearly identical (as far as I can remember) and both have the same gameplay feel (except with super powers). If you liked Grand Theft Auto / Sleeping Dogs type games but wished you weren’t restrained by the limitations of reality, give Saints Row 4 a try. ",

THat's the question Volition clearly set out to answer and I think we arrived at 'dunno, can we cram a bit more videogame in there, there's a bit of space left just over there'.   Within the first half hour you're ridiculously overpowered with super powers, by the end of the game, you're even more ridiculously overpowered with super powers and armed with a jump that can set off a nuclear explosion. No, really. Honest. You are.  Or at least, it would have been within the first half hour if I hadn't spent the first four hours playing the tutorial just because moving around the not-City is so enjoyable.

I mourn the loss of the 4 dollars that went into buying this garbage.  Let's start with the comedy, which many people say is one of this game's strongsuits. This game has very 'adult' comedy, but it ironically comes off as very childish. It's like some 7th grader talking about how much he loves weed and drugs, and making dumb ♥♥♥♥ jokes to his equally dumb friends. The references to other video game series are only references, and don't really hold any comedic weight. The funniest parts in this game are when characters are conversing, without any dumb gimmick. The witty dialouge is so much more enjoyable than 'Do a Barrel Roll XD' or '♥♥♥♥♥ XD'.  The story isn't much better, however, I don't think anybody actually cares about the story. I wouldn't either, if it didn't hinder the game to the extent that it does. The entire game takes place inside of a simulation, which makes it feel like nothing you do has any weight. Who cares if you die? Who cares about the people you're killing? It's only a simulation. All game I was begging to be taken out the simulation, and put in an actually appealing environment. The story is essentially just you doing a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t withh the excuse of that it's 'weakening the simulation'.  The gameplay was simply aggravating. I remmber being stunlocked to death many times, especially by the people with bats. This is not challenging gameplay, this is annoying gameplay. The boss fights usually turn into a game of 'Find the exploit' Since fighting them is so boring. Shooting feels incredibly dull too, it's as if I'm shooting a paintball gun. The powers are by far the best part of this game, but it gets extremely annoying when I have to switch to one of my boring powers in order to deal with people who are stunlocking me. The powers also lose their excitement as the game wears on though.",

Negatives : + Shame they lost the hispanic voice, but the french one is decent enough. + Multiplayer occasionally broke, reconnecting normally fixed it, just one nearly game breaking issue near the end where one of us had to wait at the start of the map for the other to finish a section.

The story is beautifully integrated into the gameplay where you never know if you are stuck in the vortex-coma space or real time. You think you wake up, but waking up was just a dream within the coma (you may find this as hard to follow as inception at times) so you go forth to take your revenge while time is slowing down as it runs out, your 'homeboys' backing you up cheering at you to destroy the big bad guy (of which there are several) Then once you think you can wake up you start walking the streets blasting your brain powers over all the bad people when you realize that you brain powers shouldn't be real, or should they?

            "review_text": "'Mr Anderson, welcome back'  The latest game in the Saints Row series has gone through a lot before we got to play it ourselves. Originally intended as a DLC for Saints Row: The Third, it was expanded far beyond that, and then the original Publishers for the series, THQ, went bust and this was picked up by Deep Silver. This could have been a very different game, but rather than consider what might have been, I'm here to let you know what we did get. So on to the review.   Story The game opens up with a mission where you and your crew need to stop an old enemy from attacking the US with nuclear weapons. Once you have obviously succeeded at this, you then spend several years as the President of the United States before Earth is attacked by aliens. After failing to fight back, you find yourself in the Matrix, and must learn to use this to your advantage so you can stop the alien leader and save the planet. That is all in the first hour, and only gets even crazier as you get further in the game. Its just a little over the top, but they had to outdo the previous game somehow. Saints Row has become all about having a crazy story, and Volition didn't want to disappoint.  Presentation In these aspects, the game has changed little from the previous release. Everything still looks pretty much the same, other than a few effects showing off the fact that you spend most of the game in a simulation, such as pixelization of surroundings, and the occasional glitched character (don't worry, they are meant to be messed up). The voice acting is just as good as the previous game as well, with the characters sounding as they did the last time you spent taking on enemies of the Row. Sound effects don't appear to have changed either. All of it makes it obvious that while it might have gone far beyond the original plans, this was going to be a DLC for an older game.  Now, the soundtrack at least has seen some additions, but also the loss of some older stations. The metal of The Blood is no more along with the loss of WDDT and Kabron. It instead has Mad Decent for your rap needs and Four 20 with a mix of reggae and dub. Fortunately, if you share my taste in music and listen to The Mix, you will still be satisfied by the quality of the music even if we can't sing The Final Countdown. Looking at the full selection of songs, it might not be as good as it was in Saints Row 2, but the playlist available in this game is still impressive. A nice little feature they also included is the ability to play music outside of a vehicle. Very happy with that, as you may not spend much time putting up with wheels.   Controls Another place where there have been few changes, the controls have gotten away with only a few minor tweaks to take into account the powers you have access to. Grenades have been removed so they had somewhere to map the powers, and taunts as well as recruiting and dismissing gang members now require you to hold as those keys are also used to toggle your powers. Everything else still works as it did in Saints Row: The Third.   Gameplay Now, here is where all the changes will be found. To start with, it plays just like Saints Row: The Third. Get a car, drive around, etc. But early in the game,you start picking up data clusters and taking down the Wardens of the simulation, allowing you to unlock special abilities. Running around as fast as a car and jumping like Spider-Man, then later then gliding around as if you were that guy in Prototype. Suddenly, you have little reason to even bother with a car. Not only can you cover more ground outside of one, you won't find most of the clusters needed to upgrade your powers without hopping around the rooftops to collect them. This very quickly makes most vehicles a waste of time outside of missions and moving around your useless homies.   Wait, did I just call your homies useless? Why, yes, I did. Sadly, when you move around like a demented grasshopper and can shoot fireballs or make earthquakes, some guy with a pistol won't cut it, and they can't even follow you most of the time. I hate it, but you just won't call them up for help, but only because an achievement will unlock after spending enough time with a few of them. Some of the more important homies will eventually gain their own powers by doing certain side missions, but even they are rarely needed on your various quests.   While the changes to the game have made both vehicles and your gang unneeded, the missions themselves continue to be highly enjoyable. From flying through the sky as you chase your current target to giving the smackdown to brutish aliens, the most important part of the game does the job and keeps you busy until you reach the end of the game. You have a significant number of main missions to work on, as well as all the side missions to unlock enhanced homies, extra powers, new weapons and even a new costume or two. Getting everything out of the way will take many hours of fun.   Lifespan Even after completing the main story, there is still enough to do to keep you busy for a while after the credits roll. Each of the takeover activities now has different ranks, allowing you to try for a Gold on each of them. As well as that, you can also work of completing the Challenges, but running around, jumping as much as you can, and wiping out hundreds of aliens in as many ways as possible. And even after you have done all of these and gotten a 100% save, you have the option of doing it all with a friend.   As you can see, this game is great, though not without a few flaws. Still, it is easily worth a purchase. I can't deny it was money well spent.   8 / 10",

This works for them very well and surprisingly, they deliver an exciting superhero game with a compelling, if at times ridiculous, story.

This game is basically what happens if you take the formula of GTA IV and inject it with meta-humour and general self-awareness, then you give it a plot that's 50% Independence Day and 50% The Matrix. It's a crazy fun romp of superpowered action (which is actually played in a game... well, a simulation within the game) where you smash like the Hulk, fly faster than a bullet and jump higher than a skyscraper like Superman, and quip like Deadpool all the time. There is a whole city as an open world, with many activities to carry out (think of them as mini-games, basically), items to find, and of course a main quest which involves you, your friends, and those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens that conquered Earth. Really, man, f**k those aliens.  So is it actually good? Well, it is. But if it has a problem is that the main quest + Loyalty missions (which are side quests but all different and fun like the main ones) don't take much long to complete. And as for everything else... well, after a few hours of play, you're going to be so superpowered that the world around you will be like the literal 'world of cardboard' Superman complained about. It's not hard at all to kill enemies, it in fact is so easy to hurt someone you probably will do it without realizing and end up with half the police of the city running after you. This takes a bit out of the challenge - it's at this point more or less that I just decided to finish the main quest in one go and get over with it. The game is fun and there definitely are some seriously hilarious bits of dialogue and situations, but it's also quite easy. There's nothing pushing me to seek 100% completion, personally. But as it stands, it was a good fun time, and maybe one day or another I'll pick it up to just replay it with a different character and see whether that changes something.  Also: you can romance all your crewmates, no matter your and their sex. That MUST be a good thing.",

From jumping across the islands or by running into cars and turning them into flames - causing them to explode. The music in-game is fantastic! The atmosphere as soon as you start is fabulous and the overall combat system is exactly how I remember the Saints Row series being like!  - The guns are unique, alongside the general customerization that is possible! Loads of colours, shapes of guns, even different models of sizes and types for a specific gun slot! It's overall fantastic! - The vehicles are generic, however the customerization again is excellant, being able to add body mods / colours / nos / a page of 50+ rims / it's grand! - The plastic surgery part of the game which allows you to change; gender, race, facial features, bodily features, hair, skin, you name it! ^ I love being able to swap and change, going from a pink haired gym obsessive 6ft black guy, to a 5 ft round black guy with anime green hair and a beard! You name it, the possibilities are vast! - The choice of doing main missions or side missions is grand! Without the main missions you can spend hours running around doing as you please! - So far I have 15 or so hours in Saints Row IV yet I have done around 10 main missions and the rest have been just from side quests and shooting bad guys!   I love the 80s music on certain radio stations and I also love the ability to add your own custom music &lt;- however you'll need to follow a guide online and it takes ages!  Other than that, the only downfall... Saints Row IV offers a great experience to existing or new fans...  Being able to choose colourful clothes, or guns or cars... To people running around with giant monkey or cat masks... To men in gimp costumes... To energy drink cans shooting you with machine guns -... Toilets with guns... Spongey limbs and even having the same NPC spawned 20 times over with some deformity... It all adds into an amazing, unexpected, funny game, full of colour and diverse choice. I totally recommend it!  PS: I have taken a number of screenshots on Saints Row IV - 80 + to be precise, so go through them and definitely get the game :D!!!!",

The character customization section is pretty good and you can earn some bonuses. But there is a bad side for some bonuses. For an example the run speed and high jumping bonuses are so overpowered. This breaks the car driving. You can run faster than everything jump higer than everything... So the car driving (or warmachines) becomes useless. The fighting is normal for an action game and the weapons are very funny. Some weapons has references and some weapons has sexual matters. Weapon customization is as well as character customization. The musics are very good, you can almost find all kinds of musics. (Pop, classical, etc.) Scenario is unspecific but humorous and has diffrent progress. You are nearly to neverboring gameplay experience. And when you complete the scenario you can still play and complete little things but this isn't funny than the main scenario.

Its more likely becoming a fun, mess around game.

It's over-the-top. It's essentially fight aliens inside the Matrix. It's pure fun.   You are loaded with superpowers that increase over time. You can leap tall buildings in a single bound, or run up the walls, or sprint around town far faster than any car can travel. I only used cars when the mission required it. You can shoot blasts of ice or fire from your hands. You can throw people into black holes with a gun, scoop them up and fire them from a cannon with a vehicle, or use telekinesis to drop a truck on them or throw them across town. The upgrade paths are fun, always improving your abilities. The melee animations (for no weapons) are bloody and funny.   There is plenty of diversity in missions and side quests, as you take over the simulated world store by store, block by block. There is puzzle-based hacking similar to Bioshock. There are 'Flashpoints' where you kill all the enemies. You ascend towers by leaping from one platform to the next. You duke it out in the Super Powers arena. You run a time-limited race around town with super speed, then walk around in a mech suit blowing up everything in your path, and wrap things up by slamming your face into buildings, cars, and people to rack up points. You take on 8-bit adventures, fight zombies, and hunt for countless collectibles (Zinyak statues, data points to use as upgrade points, text adventure pieces, audio logs, etc). There's just so much to do and it's all 100% chaos.  The main story is really entertaining and funny. It's a game that never takes itself seriously, but still tells a serious story that brings these characters together against the evil aliens. At a point, all the side quests and collectibles became awfully repetitive, but I still felt driven to plow through them to reach my newest super power. The story missions are varied and enjoyable and the plot reaches a satisfying and epic conclusion.   The game is open world with great graphics. You can walk the streets among countless pedestrians, listening to little sound bytes. You'll see streets full of ordinary citizens and in the middle of it all: a dominatrix walks among the suits and ties. Or a person in hot dog costume. It's strange and that's part of its charm.   I still have to play through any DLC for the game. I did buy the Season Pass, so I will play the additional content in the near future.",

Rating (5/10 = failure): 9.5 Multiplayer: Yes (2) Completion: 23 hrs Cards: Yes Cloud: Yes Cost: 20 USD  Well what can I say? If you loved the Trouble with Clones DLC from Saints Row the Third (which was awesome, btw), this game will absolutely cater to that, and I love it.  This game will no doubt feel 'cheap' how they decided to reuse Steelport in its entirety. And because of that, the whole game basically feels like a giant DLC for SR3. But that shouldn't detract you from getting it. There's still a ton that went into the game. And really, how often did you get to appreciate the city from their roofs in SR3?  Regarding the story - if the Matrix were made as an adult comedy game, I'm pretty sure this game would be the result. The game parodies a good number of things, such as Metal Gear Solid, but by far the most prominent is the Matrix universe. Just the fact that the game introduces aliens in the first few minutes should be an indication as to how silly this game is. And they take it seriously, too (sorta)! It's all in good fun. I particularly like the ending to the Enter the Dominatrix DLC. It's a bit annoying that you can't redo main story missions. Hence if you got the bad ending, you're stuck with it. One complaint about the game is how ALL of the side missions have some introductory two-line speech about how doing the mission will help break the simulation. It doesn't. Why even include those lines? Heck you can even do those activities before the side missions are given to you, which skips the dialogue altogether.  Half the game is mini-games; the other half... is collecting collectibles. For real, there are about a thousand data clusters to collect, and trying to grab them all is one heck of a time sink. Fortunately it's fun using super powers, so it's not completely bad. Just don't do it all in one go to maintain your sanity.  In a game where it's faster and safer to outpace a car on foot, it's odd that carjacking still exists, and is even required for some side missions, but I can't really complain, as it does help slow things down to make you appreciate how nice it is to go all Neo.  For the most part the scenery is nice. It's Steelport, but with altered street signs, some new alien structures, and annoying video interference that just has to remind you every 30 seconds of the world that you're in. The perma-red skies irritate the hell out of me, as it does in all games that do that, but you can change the colors once you beat it. I really wish you could change these sooner, and get rid of the interference thing altogether.  One feature that isn't outright stated is that you can turn the radio on at most times during gameplay using the &lt; or &gt; keys. It's a lot better than listening to silence, and they have some good radio stations. I admit I rather enjoyed the 80s Mix. Nothing like hurling fireballs and flying around to 'What is Love?'  Saints Row 4 has a lot of good points. SR3 had a much more involved story and as a whole SR3 was a tighter, focused experience. SR4 ends up feeling like a giant game of mini-games. But hey, they're both good fun!",

Honestly I can't think of a single major criticism for this game, it has everything you could ever want in an open world game, outstanding amount of gameplay and content and limitless ability to do it all.",

Another small thing, there is a certain activitiy that you can only do with a friend online, you cannot do them by yourself, so I cannot vouch for how good or bad it is.

The outrageous gameplay is all about having fun while taking out your enemies in the most stylish way possible while using your powers.

Like the last one, the only way to really enjoy the game is to take nothing seriously and just have fun, and that's really easy in this game.  Once you get past the opening segment and start getting your super powers it's an absolute blast. You can't have multiple powers available at once, but you can easily switch between them, and traversal powers like super speed and super jump are always at your disposal, eliminating the need for any vehicle once you level up stamina and get certain upgrades, but you'll get in vehicles anyway for the sweet neon cars and monster-truck versions of pre-existing vehicles, and if you get the presidential dlc you get the most hilarious jet which you will probably not be able to resist riding around in either.  Add to that all the sci-fi movie and game references (the whole thing is almost a parody of Mass effect, with 'loyalty missions' for all of your homies, romance options [where all you do is shag, but like I said: parody] and of course the space, 3rd-person shooter theme) and throw in ways to feel closer to all of your friends, which was unexpected but endearing when you start learning how they cope with the situations they are or have been in, and their views on you. Put all that together and what you have is a game that will give you hours upon hours of entertainment. The worst thing I could find about this game is that they (SPOILERS) killed Oleg. I guess when Deep Silver bought the franchise they took some kind of poll to figure out who everyone's favorite characters were and went with them, which explains why Kinzie is such a central character this time around. Still doens't explain why Oleg (whom I always thought was wildly popular) was 'cut' (possibly to remove the brute class altogether, which is also a weird/dumb play,) so that and not only Angel's death, but complete absence from the story were the worst things about the game for me. If you have a sense of humor and want to play something that's just a fun, dumb good time, this game is a must-buy. I'd suggest picking up the edition that comes with all the dlc which is nearly all costumes and cosmetics(which is all dlc should be,) with some weapons, vehicles, and even some side-missions thrown in for end-game content, as it just makes the game more fun/silly, and it's a fairly common thing to go on sale. Hell, if it's on sale then the Saint's franchise pack is also probably on sale, which I'd suggest even more. So get out there and see how corny/silly/badass you can be gosh-darnit!",

The gameplay alone, running around Steelport with your super powers, was the main thing that got me hours playing non-stop. I even delayed the story missions because doing side quests was a blast.   It's worth noting that the story of this game is heavily connected with the previous installments of the franchise, so If you want to fully enjoy that aspect of SR 4 it'd be better that you have played from SR 1 to 3.

Having super powers is a great add on to the game and make it fun to mess around with. The cars are a bit useless in my view as you can sprint,glide or jump place to place faster than driving there. The other thing that gets a bit annoying is the simulation glitch that shows on the buildings and cars which makes it unpleasent from time to time but there is a mod to remove that which is nice!

            "review_text": "Saints Row IV is an odd game, even for Saint's Row standards. Entertaining humour filled with refferences to everything from Star Wars, to the Matrix, Mass Effect and more. I think that's one of the main points if you'll enjoy this game or not, meaning the humour. Because honestly the game doesn't really have much else going for it.   The enemy AI actually feels 'dumbed down' from Saints row 3 which is conciderably odd as SR4 is obvously copy-pasted from SR3. This also means that the gameworld brings little to almost nothing new compared to SR3. If you played SR3 you will laugh at all the re-used assets. The overall gameworld feels familiar with the exception of a few hovering alien towers.  One of the focuses of the game is on activities or 'side quests'. A lot of the activities return such as Mayhem or my personal favorite insurance fraud (Mayhem is pretty much just blow things up and insurance fraud encourages you to take large amounts of damage and combo it up) and of course new ones such as Platforming Rift which is pretty much what you'd imagine it to be (platforming) and TK-Mayhem (cause mayhem and destruction using telekinesis).   The game does a bad job explaining what you can and can not do. Such as forcing you to use an ability or do something spesificly only to explain to you a few minutes later how to perform that spesific action. To be fair I believe this only happend twice(?) in the game.   Most of the superpowers are surprisingly not satisfying to use. It's clear that SR3 wasn't made for superpowers which makes it an odd combo at times. Being able to blow up eight+ enemies with a simple use on the 'force' power tree, having life stealing bullets and powers also makes this game incredibly easy, repetive and boring. Even your punches are super powered which means if you want a challenge you have to tune up the difficulty and use guns instead of punching (yeah sounds weird).  The story is ... I'm not entierly sure what to call it. Earth gets invaded by aliens and you (the president) get trapped inside a simulation to help defeat the aliens. The story will bring you through very familiar places from SR1, SR2 and SR3 (don't worry, if you haven't played those, it's still easy to follow what's going on).   I'll defiently recommend this game, but only if you are the kind of person that's looking for a humourus and 'less than traditional story'. If you're not into the Saints Row type of humour then I don't think you should buy this game. As the story can't carry a game.  + Audio Good controller support Humour Plenty of different activities (allthough some are quite similar) Unusual story Car Handling (allthough there's no reason to drive a car) Relatively short game (most of the time will be spendt on activities)  - Enemy AI Re-used game from SR3 Re-used assets everywhere Lack of costumisation Brings surprisingly little new from SR3 Unsatisfying combat Jumps and gaps in the story ",

But it's also a lot more than that.  Let's get the obvious out of the way: the superpowers are stupidly fun to play with. Leaping over whole buildings, throwing cars (or anything really) with your mind, and punching the ground so hard you create a nuclear explosion are ALL things you can look forward to doing in SRIV. The city of Steelport is much more fun to play around in compared to SR3, but the ability to make it from one side of the map DOES have the effect of making it seem a tad small.  The writing is FANtastic. I honestly can't remember the name of the villain in SR3 but SRIV gives us the hilarious Zinyak, who is so easy and fun to hate. I played with Laura Bailey's voice and she absolutely kills it as the Boss. One complaint though is that there are less cutscenes than SR3, which may have been an attempt to 'cut the BS' in favor of just getting to the gameplay but I quite liked the cutscenes. The few that there are are better than ever, however. 'What are you going to do, bravado me to death?'  The story missions remain the funnest thing to do in the game. The side missions have survived the transition, but adjusted for the inclusion of superpowers. Insurance Fraud is a must play, considering you can ragdoll yourself over entire buildings. One HUGE flaw however: you still cannot replay story missions and this kills me. Many of the story missions are pure manic fun and I'd love to go back and fly through space to the tune of 'what is love?' but I can't without starting a fresh file.   SRIV was one of my favorite releases by FAR in 2013. It has the outward appearance of a game that was made by people who well and truly stopped caring a long time ago, but the truth is that they care an awful lot about giving you the most stupidly fun experience that they humanly can, and it shows.",

Think of every open-world game you've played since the first Saints Row game came out. Now think about the best elements of those all mixed into a game that I feel strangely compelled to describe with the phrase 'cataclysmically ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic', as I'm not sure lesser terms will do.  Now, I'm not saying this is the game to end all games. There are quite a few repetitive side quests, it only took me about 16 hours to finish all missions (not all challenges, though) and WAY too many Mayhem missions of infinitely stale varieties (Steer a tank! Fly a UFO! Throw a ball!), but there are enough totally badass moments to make up for those. The plot is strangely engaging for the premise, really giving players a look back at the true natures of the Saints and their foes, through their nightmares and their greatest triumphs. Plus, there's a telekinesis system that actually grabs the damn thing you want it to, unlike every other game I've seen try it.  The radio selection is subpar, but the original soundtrack is bountiful, and the licensed songs that do get used are perfectly timed. The game takes all its blatant parodies in spectacular stride, while still coming across as a Saints Row story first and foremost. Those who've stuck with the series since the beginning will find a lot to love in returning content, as will PC users who had to start with SR2 (you're really going to just be confused for, like, two missions, in that case).  The powers just work well, though the game's repeated insistence on taking them away from you for missions gets a bit grating eventually. There are also some major glitches at this stage, but programmers and modders are fast at work on them. Basically, as with The Third, if you can't get past something, turn down your resolution.  All in all, this game is simply irresistible. If you haven't played the game, you probably don't get what I'm referring to. More incentive to play it.",

            "review_text": "If you have played Saints Row The Third, you have a general knowledge of the concept of Saints Row IV. This third person action/adventure/comedy/superhero satire of society and Grand Theft Auto is an absolute blast to mess around in, but falls flat in some other key areas.  The gameplay in Saints Row IV is very much like that of Saints Row the Third, with the same weapons classes, same shooting styles, in fact, the only things that make it different is the addition of super powers and the new weapons. You either use an overwhelming amount of firepower or your supernatural abilities to lay waste to the aliens that assault you as well as some other enemies. Combat is just as fun as in SR The Third, but don't expect much in the way of innovation. The one area that is very different from SR The Third is with the new superpowers. These are a heck of a lot of fun to play around with, and I have gotten probably at least half of all my kills with these skills. While these abilities keep the game fresh and help stop stagnation, it isn't enough to justify getting IV over The Third just on gameplay merits alone.  While story hasn't been as critical to the Saints Row series since the last game, it still has one and should be discussed. I won't provide any spoilers that have happened as of yet, but the plot is fairly interesting, and filled with a bunch of good laughs and is mostly satirical, and not to be taken seriously in any way. This serves to the rest of the goofy game's benefit, but players of Saints Row 2 that are hoping to a return to that story will be very much let down. One thing that I noticed about the optional side missions in the game is that they are extremely repetive mini-game chains. It seems like they are almost like an RPG's quests, taking you from one miscellaneous mission to the next in persuit of unlocking a new power or costume, while not pushing the story further in any way. Even though I was dissapointed that there was no connection to the game's story with all of these mssions, I found myself doing each of them one after another to gain more power and try to get the gold in each minigame. Many people may tire of these quests's repetitiveness, but you will end up doing them anyways and they aren't bad.  The graphics in Saints Row IV are not mind blowing, even on maxed settings, but the cartoonish atmosphere (at least to me) fits the game quite well. The aethstetic that the virtual city provides does make it seem like you are in a computer simulation, although the eternal night and shimmering textures do get kind of annoying at some points. Another thing that I have noticed is that the game is not well optimized for the PC, and even on my powerful hardware I noticed frequent framerate drops when moving very quickly or jumping very high and looking down. I guess it could be expected that looking at a large portion of a city from above would reduce one's framerate, but even when running through the streets I noticed dips as low as 40 FPS on my GTX 770, which is weird when I have played better looking games that run consistently better (Crysis series, Battlefield 3, Assassin's Creed IV) that also have large AI and real player counts in view.   To conclude this review: If you were a fan of Saints Row the Third and crave more mayhem similar to that game, then SRIV is a great buy. However, if you are still fine with mucking about in The Third or didn't care for it, I would second guess this silly game's buy. My final verdict for this game is an 8 out of 10, good fun.",

Some of the minigames are a real pain to get through, specially if you want to make sure you get the gold rank. Vehicles are present but you'll hardly use them, since your super speed and super jump will allow you to go over buildings without a hitch, not to mention doing so is actually way faster than any vehicle. Anyway, if you don't mind a sandbox game where the story is a big ♥♥♥♥ you to conventions and isn't afraid of some dirty jokes, you'll like this game.",

Escape the simulation that's trapped the Saints crew, or die trying. The consistent thrill of Saints Row IV is how it constantly, eagerly, happily, accommodatingly asks you “Hey, how do you want to break the game now?” And for a game so colossal, so occasionally dumb, so often colossally sharks-with-laser-beams-on-their-heads-that-can-also-breathe-fire-and-fly-and-turn-invisible-and-you-can-even-ride-them dumb, what an incredibly smart thing to do with an open world, a franchise, and a story. There's some uneven bits but Saints Row IV captures what video games should be or at least strive to be: Fun. And that exuberance of playing around in a big sandbox with almost no limits placed on the player while spinning an entertaining yarn that fully acknowledges that it's a game should put Saints Row IV on a lot of Game of Year lists. A fantastic game, keeping up the series' tradition of giving players a wide open world and the tools to go absolutely bonkers within it. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and most of all, its fun to play.",

We are now a super-powered POTUS... *facepalms*  In all honesty, the game is pretty good, and the story, dialog and characters are just as sill (if not more so) than before, so you're bound to be laughing out loud more than a few times as you play. The downside is that the game is almost a carbon-copy of SR3. Yes, there are some changes; no cribs just gateways to the ship, cosmetic changes to the city, etc... but you're still in Steelport, or a least a version of it, so there's nothing new to explore. There are also less activites, and instead of how they were in SR3, where each had it's own goal and that was that, now they all have 3 levels of completion; Bronze, Silver and Gold, so instead of a new mission each time you're replaying the same levels over again to get higher scores, which gets grind-like after a while of trying to score Gold on all instances of an activity to complete a Challenge and get the reward.  As for DLCs, aside from Enter The Dominatrix and How the Saints Save Christmas, their all cosmetic stuff that gets old fast, so unless you *really* want them, you can ignore them.  Replay value here is low, since there are no alternate solutions to some mission like there were in SR3 (the ones linked to the achievements). And aside from two achievements linked to play time and playing as both a Male and Female character for a certian amount of time, you'll probably just beat the game in co-op and single player once or twice and that'll be that.  Now, I know everything I've said has been harsh, but thats just the truth. The game itself is great, and unless Volition changes their minds, this is the last Saints Row game we're ever gonna see, so if you liked the series, at least pick this up when it's on sale and give it a go.  EDIT: This may not be the last Saints Row game, but I'm not sure. As far as I remember, I read several articles on this being the last SR game we'll see. However, given how there's still a decent community for this game, from modders to players, and the devs are willing, we may see a SRV... but I wouldn't hold my breath.",

All of which are in different scenarios (their worst nightmare, litterally), but the thought process is the same. So yeah, without the filler this game could potentially be just DLC for SR3, but the change in gameplay via superpowers makes it worth it. Very rarely will you ever use a man made gun, or even drive a vehicle for that matter. Tons of collectibles, the usuall side quests, and challanges to boot to give you tons of gameplay time so long as you don't just skip everything and just do main story missions only. As usual per the series the game is full of 'wtf awesome!' moments that have you sitting back and applauding the writers for thinking of this ♥♥♥♥!  ***Side Note***  The 'Saints Save Christmas DLC' is a MUST get.

It's enjoyful like previous games of the series and I've enjoyed till the end of all quests of the game as well, but I couldn't get the taste of SR3. Integrating superpowers to the game leads too much inspration by Prototype. I know SR a little includes concepts from other games but in SR4 this idea is overdone in my opinion. Also, acting like Prototype's Alex reduces the importance of using motor vehicles compared to the previous SR games, especially to find collectables like data clusters, Zinyak statues, texts, audio records. No doubt SR4 can be considered as a DLC for SR3. The main story would be longer. Moreover we cannot understand the purpose of doing side quests that get similar and boring at the same time. Most of them consist of the following format: hack the store, then upload the virus, then come to the ship and see me. These can be completed before the final main quest in order to gain the related achievement. On the other hand the game is not rough as much as the previous ones. Superpowers lead the efficiency of reguler weapons get reduced. Calling Saint followers is usually not neccessary as the previous games. So I suggest you buy the game just if it's at an enormous discount.",

I'm not all of the way through it, but the story seems fairly good. Also everything is littered with humor. Good humor, most of the time.

You're placed right into the heat of combat, without the slow paced action that was annoying at first in the other Saints. The enviornment in the virtual world is AWESOME, I really don't mind the day and night shifts with how it looks! The guns feel like there was no change from the third, but it has some more customization with the camo. Wish there was more. Not a huge fan with the super powers, though. I stick with my guns rather than running around using the same sprint take down. It just feels like game is way too easy if I just use the powers. Hillariously easy. Even though I hate using the super powers in combat, but its great not relying on a car or plane. With all that said, Saints Row IV is turning out way better than I had expected. It just sucks to accept the fact that we probably won't get our old gangsta Saints again. However, A+ to not sticking to the same formula and having new twists to each game.",

However, would most certainly recommend this game over GTAV.

Saints Row 4 has good humour between characters, it is fun to play as there is always something to do, and much like in Saints Row 3, it has alot of freedom in the game for you to go and customize pretty much anything, complete side missions and visit places. The addition of 'aliens' in this game adds to the fun, which is what I like. Althought it doesn't feel much like Saints Row 1 or 2 anymore, it's like a huge expansion to Saints Row 3, more wild and more over-the-top.  One of the problems, however, for many people is just how OTT this game is. Yes, you are supposed to be a 'Saint' - a run and gun killing machine in a gang of America. But that isn't what this game is even more. Saints Row 3 is the middle-line between serious and fun. Saints Row 2 is the serious game, and Saints Row 4 is the fun one. Personally, I prefer Saints Row 4 over the other two, as it is just a great game with good gameplay, engaging story and wild powers.   9/10.",

Right off the bat, the writing and over-the-top humor got me laughing more than SR3 ever could, and the intro itself was very well done. At first, the game does go a bit slow after you finish the first third of the opening missions prior to entering Steelport. Things do pick up right after the opening, however, when you get your first set of superpowers. A lot of people complained that the superpowers made things too easy. Personally, the game is still difficult with the powers, though I recommend setting the difficulty to hardcore for some real challenge. The interaction between you and your homies is funny to listen to, as well as their interactions with Zinyak, the alien leader.  The music choice is awesome. What is Love, The Touch and How We Do It are great tracks to listen to while beating up aliens, and it further increases the fun when you can listen to the music on foot (unlike SR3 where you had to be in a vehicle).  There are a few problems with the game, though. A majority of the extra missions get repetitive, almost always being a destruction-based minigame, followed by a clear the area segment and then returning to the ship to claim your reward. Some of the rewards are saitisfying, like the Dubstep Gun, but the missions get too repititive to want to do them all consistantly. The use of powers make vehicles a bit useless unless you're one to cause old-style mayhem ala SR3. Unless you have Superpowered homies, it even makes the use of calling homies useless, as you are a one-man powerhouse from the get-go. It's a shame because you get alot more in homie selection and vehicle customization.  Aside from that, the game has MANY more pros than cons, and I recommend this game in every way possible. If you want to play an open-world superhero game with great humor, this is the game for you",

In saints four, you do alot of cool stuff, however the mission variety is slim, aside from a few cool set peices.

NO   REASONING / SPOILERS BELOW: Don't read if you haven't played SRIV for at least a few hours -----------------------------  I enjoyed my time in the virtual world of SRIV but the same things I liked are what make it a bad sequel. Within the first few hours of play, the current world of saints row is blown up in an attempt to keep up with the power creep of each release. In SR1 you fight for the streets; SR2 for the city; SR3 for the island; SRIV for the world; SRV for the universe?. So thanks to their increasing of the stakes, SRIV had no where to go but up in terms of size/wackiness but they went too far and destroyed the world   (literally)   of Saints Row in favor of a more configurable reality. This new 'world' is one that allows for super powers and other things to occur without it being 'law-defying' but this new mechanic overshadows and effectively ruins the established gameplay mechanics from the older games which they still tried to cram in.   Driving/Customizing  - Tons of fun to find your ride and trick it out.. This is made useless thanks to super speed/Jump-gliding  Shooting  - Super powers do more damage and use a regenerating ammo. After a few hours you can essentially stop using guns altogether. (Ammo becomes infinite much later)  Gun Upgrades  - Same as shooting, super powers upgrade and become practically infinite.  Melee  - Now this one they actually did a good job on. They integrated the new 'super powered' melee moves that you could augment with later powers.  If they spent time and thought it out, I bet they could have found a way for the super powers and old mechanics to co-exist better but in the end they left them there to rot.   Now if they would have marketed it differently, I may have let it slide. As an Expansion: It would have just been viewed as a refreshing change to shake up the gameplay As a 'titled' release (EX: Saints Row: The Power-ing): Same as expansion As a 'NUMBERED' release: It is an unwanted revamp to an already fun formula.  The reason why a numbered release pisses me off is it implies the events of the game are of the main story and not some side branch. This means the next game will have to continue where SRIV left off and honestly, the SRIV devs did SR5 no favors in terms of a lead in. They could ignore everything that happened in IV and treat it like a side branch or a dream or something but doing so would just prove the previous game should have never been 4.  -----------  All ranting aside, for ~20 bucks for ~16 hours is a pretty good deal and definitely worth the purchase if you like the crude humor of Saints Row and the crackdown-esque gameplay.. just ignore that it is a Saints Row sequel if it bugs you as much as me.   (Also hunting orbs is too damn addictive)",

I think they copied Prototype's movement and incororated it here.  2. Nonsenensical story Out of nowhere, aliens.  CONS 1. Too much copying Spaceship, sex scenes and 'save-the-world-from-an-alien-invation' from Mass Effect.  Game works like GTA, free world and quest locations all over the map.

If you're completely new to Saint's Row, then imagine GTA with a slapstick sense of humor rather than a dark one. If you've played 3, then this is going to feel like nothing has changed. Specifically, the world is reskinned and the super powers from the DLC are the only 'new' mechanic that differentiates this entry.  If your experience with Saint's Row is either the origingal or 2, then be prepared for a very huge tonal shift. Whereas the original entries are GTA knock-offs, this it more like a clone decided to steal a gallon of nitrous oxide and fall into a vat of chemicals. The resultant monster is funny at times, depressing at others, yet thoroughly worth your time.    As far as DLC goes....maybe wait for the complete pack to go on sale. Most of the DLC is just character clothing, with the occasional item thrown in. My experience is that Gat out of Hell is the only really great content worth seeking out on its own, but given what happened with 3 you won't have to wait too long before everything will be put out in one discounted pack.",

I suggest doing the side quests because they can give you bonus items. There are some bugs in it as to be expected with most PC games. In a couple DLCs you have to change the size of the screen do complete some tasks. I don't know why but you do. Overall, this game is very addicting and is worth the money.",

Even it being a open world with many side missions, I personally lost interest after I had completed all of the campaign missions. I would say it is completely worth $15 at the most if you enjoy crazy chaos games with little to no important story.

Well, about those: Some activities that use superpowers are great fun, examples including that Genki telekinesis minigame, Blazin', Telekinesis(?) Rift, Speed Rift, and Insurance Fraud, but a lot of activities and missions, in particular the combat aren't much fun. The combat can be fun at times, but often it's all stiff and awkward, and it has those typical lategame action game tropes where there's stupid shields and you can only use particular powers or weapons against particular enemies which just slow big fights down. There is one particularly fun combat sequence near the end which is in VR, but in general the combat isn't very fun. What makes people like this game is the fact that it has a bunch of fun setpieces and missions. Other sandbox games, I feel, though, have more impactful missions because everything is less over the top. Great superhero games, too, have more memorable missions and more fun navigation because the world is more normal (i.e Spiderman 2, Ultimate Spiderman, Crackdown).  This game gets a very unenthusiastic reccommendation.",

I haven't played any of the previous SR titles but after this I want to try them.   SR4 is basically a mix of gameplay from GTA and Batman Arkham City, wrapped up in a Matrix-like story. You are trapped in a virtual environment, which gives great story-based excuse to randomly destroy stuff, run over people, and also have super powers (as opposed to GTA where you just do it to be an a$$).   The game has an excellent soundtrack, hilariously woven in with the missions and story (youtube: “Saints Row nuclear Aerosmith”). At a later point in time after rescuing a homie, you and he are battling through hordes of bad guys together to the tune of “The Boys are Back in Town.”   The story itself is fun and quite entertaining, and gives you the opportunity to fight with your superpowers in the virtual world, then without them in the real world. You get to save humanity, fight aliens, struggle to save your friends, and “romance” (f!ck) them afterwards, if you so choose. You’ll leap over tall buildings (or run up them), smash into the ground to damage everything in the area, throw fire, ice and shoot electricity, use telekensis to pick up and throw vehicles, and cause general mayhem and destruction in order to crash the virtual simulation so you can break out your homies and take down the aliens that run it all.  Graphics are pretty good, nothing groundbreaking but more than sufficient to make the game look nice. The gameplay and sounds are excellent. The voice acting is superb, the characters are fun and believable, and you have a multitude of options for your character aside from the usual physical customizations, including different voice styles and tones. You can even select “the scroob” (SpaceBalls) as your gang’s “thing” they do to taunt.   One comment about DLC’s – there are tons available for this game, but all they do is add more (themed) costumes and weapons. The game already has lots of choices for costumes and weapons. I want to buy a DLC that gives me more story to play through.   The story, gameplay and audio make this game superb. Its high ratings and reviews are well earned.   EDIT: Steam censors",

It's single player duration is so laughable with little practice you can get to finish it in a free weekend, despite you don't get to play the even lesser lived DLC that will surely come in the future as a bundle.

But I just couldn't enjoy it, and I really tried, finished the game to find out it just mediocre. This could be fun as a side story or DLC for few hours, but It definitely doesn't have content for stand alone game.  1. For those familiar with previous games, SR4 have completely different feel to it. You don't get that 'gang' feeling and there is no reason to actually  care  about the city. 2. Superpowers ruin a lot of gameplay. I know it is reason many people like this game, I might be exception, but I actually enjoyed previous games because of those little things like driving, finding new things, exploring. It also makes everything too easy. I don't wanna be unkillable (at least you can always run like a rabbit) and crush everything in sight instantly (more or less). 3. It actually wasn't funny. There were few fine scenes, but that's about it. Without characters like   Gat and Zimos  , there is so much you can do, right? 4. It's repetitive, and I mean a lot. At least that's my opinion.  -&gt; SR4 might be for you, if you enjoy 'god-like' openworld. If you want just fool around, go ahead.  -&gt; If you're looking for good story, more balanced world, and  some  funny moments, play SR3 instead.  -&gt; For those who like rougher, more gangster like stories, SR2 is the best choice.

Saints Row IV lacks the seriousness and the entertaining gang-banger theme that Saints Row I, II, and III had. However, I believe that after Saints Row II, The much loved, acclaimed Saints Row series took a turn for the worst, after fun, bright graphics were replaced by a stupid amount of blow up dolls and references to other games. Saints Row IV does not feel like a Saints Row game, as the gangsters we enjoyed killing are replaced by Aliens which we don't get that much enjoyment out of.  The customizability is poor, and the need for cars is next to nothing as it's replaced by super sprint and jumping so high that it's hard to land on the thing you want to, nevertheless, it's a fun game.

            "review_text": "This game seems very lazy. Most of the content is from SRTT and it's DLC. The only 'new' things added were some digital graphics(which got old real fast), some new models for enemies, and the Wardens. Those are pretty much the only new things this game brings.  Before you say 'well this game brought super powers in!' keep in mind they already did that in SRTT with DLC. They did polish it up and made it the main feature, but that's it. It's not new.  They did fix the weapons from SRTT though. In SRTT the guns did practically no damage to enemies and the enemies were bullet sponges.   One of the biggest things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off about this game was the Enter the Dominatrix DLC. That was a steaming pile. It was just using base game materials for most of the DLC. Then they announce a giant monster is coming and then cut to a story board fight where Birk kills it. You can say they did that as a joke, but the way I see it is that they were too lazy/cheap to actually make it happen. I'm not sure why they brought Donnie into this. They didn't bring Dex back because they thought it would alienate new players, but they bring in a minor character like Donnie? Dex was a big character in SR1.  The base game blows. The side missions are unbearable as each one is the same. It's either 'clear out that area', 'assasinate that virus', or 'hold off this painfully long wave fight'. The side missions were so damn repetitve. It was agonizing. There was little incentive to do them anyways. The most you could get was unlocking a door to teleport to. Big whoop. You can glide there faster than you can find a portal, leave the world, go back in and warp there. The one sie mission that stands out is the super powered arena fight, but that blows. It's not fund having to fight people who have super powers when all they do is jump far away for no reason and telekentically throw things at you with pinpoint accuracy which makes you ragdoll. The side mission rewards were not worth the trouble. I would rather not upgrade my guns than have to do the same side mission I just did 3 times already.  The Warden fights were far too annoying. Every single warden fight could only be ended when you button mashed like crazy. That can tire your fingers out quick if you do it frequently. Wardens deterred me from doing most things because I didn't want to deal with the hassle. They aren't even hard to fight. They are just annoying. Especially early game when you have to fight them with the crappy telekenesis power. They wuld have been much more tolerable if they would die like in the training sims where they just pop.  They took out all of the cribs. Yes, I know they did that because Zin-yak wanted to 'break' them, but without safe houses, it was just city. No where else to go. I don't know why Volition keeps taking out interior buildings as they progress in their series. SR2 had so many enterable buildings. SR3 had significanly less. SRIV I think has 2(Kinzies old warehouse and the bar). I like to have buildings I can enter. It gets boring when all you do is kill on the street. There's nothing else to do. I liked being able to enter my crib and just sit around or jump off the roof.  I also hated how all the characters were aware it was a simulation, but still didn't really accept what that meant. The loyalty missions were painfully crappy. They knew those 'people' were AI, but still talked to them as if they were the real things. They knew they weren't real, but still acted like they were. King went as far as to give the AI Tanya a 'second chance' despite 'her' being a program meant to kill them and nothing more. The whole 'Tanya' AI was a load too. Why would an AI designed by the people who designed the entire simulation need to wrangle up some AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in a digital world? It made no sense. Another part was how they all thought Kinzie's warehouse was 'safe'. Not a single place is safe there. Zin-Yak can see and change anything he wants there. Kinzie knew this, but suddenly just ignores it. They were going to talk about their plan there instead of talking about it on the ship(which would have made a lot more sense).  Vehicles are useless. I don't know why so many of the DLC packs included vehcles. The moment you start gliding is the moment you never get in a car again. When you upgrade your running to the max, I'm pretty sure you run faster than any car and you have better handling and mobility. The garage is completely useless except for VTOLs.  All the DLC is laughable. They only include a few missions and useless features. The Christmas DLC was the most enjoyable(seems like they actually put a little effort into it with the whole Santa's workshop since it didn't use basegame materials), but it only added 3 missions that were painfully short. All together the DLC equals $30. Most of the DLC packs are completely useless. They add vehicles(which are useless the second you can glide), weapons skins(most are crap), and a few costumes(I wore none of them).  The most fun I had in the game(aside from the first experience with super powers) were the missions where you had to go to the real world and fight. Not the Mech missions. Those were very boring. I'm talking abut the missions where you were on foot. Unfortunately there are very few times you get to do this and you are stuck with 3 guns(unless you cheat some in).  The whole GAt thing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I hated how they killed him in 3, but they kept pushing that he died. Even Phillipe and Viola stated he was dead and they were right there. You think they would wonder why after they got knocked out that Gat was missing. Him being captured made no sense since in SR3 Phillipe and Viola always bring up how he died. Don't get me worng, I love Gat, but that's just bad how they did it. If you make a decision like that you should stick to it. Not screw with the story and have it make no sense.  The whole 'Fun Shaundi' character bothered me. She wasn't real, yet everyone acted as if she was. Shaundi(whom I hated since SRTT) would even talk to it as if it was her past self.   The Ship was boring and useless. There was nothing worth doing on it. The only times I ever went on it was when a mission told me to.  After you beat the game there is nothing to do. It gets real boring running around blowing things up. That's all you can do. The side missions are way too tedious to even consider fun. It was worse than SRTT after you beat it. At least in SRTT you could go to zombie island and kill zombies, mess around in your cribs, or fight gangs.   The thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most is that the game is basically SRTT.5. The whole game really should have been a DLC pack. Cut out the ridiculous repetitive side missions and the game is pathetically small(aka DLC sized). Even the map is frustrating. It's just the SRTT map with minor alterations(deleting the cribs, adding those annoying domes, those towers, and a few floating platforms). I hated the SRTT map. It was so boring. It was all industrial city. Nothing else. SR2 at least had variations. There was a clean upper class section, a ghetto, a suburban area, a mountain with trees, small islands off the shore that aren't connected by bridges, a trailer park, and much more. The SRTT map had 2 types of areas. Industrial and regular city.  A minor complaint, but of all things to NOT bring from 3, why did they not bring the zombies back? The zombie cheat would have made the game so much more tolerable. The zombies are the one thing that really pulls me to play SRTT again. If SRIV had zombies, I would play it more often since the weapons are far better than SRTT's weapons.   Don't get me wrong, I will still play the game, but I do not reccomend it. If you do insist on getting it, you should either get it used on a console without DLC(trust me, the DLC is NOT worth it) or get it on sale.",

Graphics Poor graphics, low draw distance for cars &amp; people, running on this PC that can play the likes of Assassin's Creed Unity on full, a game that has far better graphics, to then playing this is a massive downgrade, its like the developers just made this game and published it, without even playing it! it should be capped at 60fps and more optimised, as well as HD textures and Cutscenes! --------------------- while i've said all of this it has its fun moments, not as good as its previous games but it will allow you to waste time! wait till its on special offer again, until they actually fix it!

But in Volition's quest to top SR3, they lost the soul, personality, and humor of the game. SR3 was over the top, but in an intelligent way. Parts were satire, others were parody, or puns. There was a story. There were characters. And there was game balance. SR4 feels like it was designed by a roomful of drunk frat boys whose contributions were along the lines of, 'Duh, huh. Let's, like, make it bigger and stuff. And let's make the alien say 'poop'! G-he, g-he, g-he.' The jokes and the one-liners fall flat. Vehicles, one of the joys of SR3, are completely worthless in SR4. You run faster than the fastest vehicle -- never mind if you jump, soar, or fly! -- and you can run through the toughest vehicle and destroy it. Heck, that's faster than shooting a rocket at it. The result is that while you couldn't pry my away from SR3 in my first playthrough, I find it hard to get motivated enough to do more than 30 minutes or so at a time in SR4 and I walk away feeling as if nothing actually happened.",

            "review_text": "Quite good for its price. I was told to avoid buying it because it was 'weird' and bad. Well, assuming it's less than 3€ in certain key shops, it's more than worth the money. It took for me about 22 hours to get 79%. The only remarcable 'con' is that it is no longer a 'classic' Saints Row game, talking about the meta-game itself. As soon as you get super powers, conduction and vehicles are useless 85% of the time. Maybe longer. Shooting is still important, but not as much as it used to be.  That said, the characters are back (Shaundi, Kinzie, Pierce... the saint flow!!). Dialogues are still great, as usual. Graphics are nice and performance is quite good (I ran it with my integrated GPU for few days and still got 60 FPS in low quality, so it's a 10/10 optimization).  The 'extras' (races, chaos, fraud...) are still there with some new missions, which I found to be great indeed. There are also lot of secondary quests, which were not great but neither bad. Just average. The plot was... good. Not awesome, but quite good I'd say. Better than expected for sure. You can still customize vehicles and your character, although you're not using much vehicles this time.  As I agree that SR3 was far, far better than this, I could not say if this is better than SR2, as it had a good plot, but it was unnecessary crude, as I see. This one has is own drama, but it has nothing to do with that grimm in SR2. I also found some characters to be unknown, as I didnt played SR1. That was kind of anoying, as playing SR2 wasn't a problem to me after playing SR3. Still managed to survive, tho.  So, things are like theese: Pros: +Nice dialogues, nice plot, nice Saint Flow. +Paul +Awesome optimizacion and nice graphics +Fast and therefore 'hard' movement. Races are quite more a deal than they were in previous games. +Paul +Charismatic antagonist +Weapons went mad this time. The are some masterpieces like the 'Dumbstepator', the 'hinflaray', a bacl hole machine...You even have a plundger thrower, god dammit!  Cons: -Vehicles are no longer worth your time -The game is VERY different to the other Saint series. I didnt found this bad, but many people do. -Some DLCs are very unbalanced. I bugged a main quest by accident, as I killed more than 60 guys with just 1 skill, killing the 'event proc' in the way.. On the other side, they include the 'América'. Firethrower, rocketlauncher and bullets... all at once! -Super powers? I liked them tho : ) -Paul. -You may find some characters unknown if you did not play the whole series. I did : (  All in all, and keeping in mind that you can get the game for less than 5 bucks, I think this game is more tan worth. Not only your money, but your time. Remember to make sure you play cooperative, you'll laugh double : )",

            "review_text": "The Saint’s Row franchise has been detaching itself from reality more and more, putting distance between it and the (relatively speaking) more grounded Grand Theft Auto games. After the generally cray-cray Saint’s Row: The Third, the question was how much further Volition – the main company behind the games – was willing to push the madness. Saint’s Row IV provides the answer in the form of aliens, virtual reality and superpowers. After a (near?) death experience set to the tune of Aerosmith’s ‘I don’t wanna miss a thing’, you end up as president of the US of A, just as aliens invade. You get thrown into a Matrix-like city where you start a resistance movement to save the last few remnant of mankind. How you can do this while closely monitored in a simulation that is at the Alien Overlord’s control is a bit fuzzy. But never mind coherence and plotholes. (Which the game is happy to point to itself.) This smartly stoopid sandbox game is actually the most entertaining superhero simulator I’ve played so far.  To start with the stoopid part; yes, the game is amazingly crass and juvenile. You can punt someone half-way down the street with a giant ♥♥♥♥♥, should you feel the need. Or you can give someone an anal probe if you were ‘lucky’ enough to score that particular bit of bonus content. But overall, the game has a unusually relaxed and pleasant attitude about sex and gender. You can pick a male body, combine it with a female voice and then cross-dress to your heart’s content. Sure, there are mostly naked female bodies on display, but male nudity gets just about equal time. My male alter-ego ended up enthusiastically performing a sexy/ridiculous stripper dance while nearly nude in a strip-club in front of a mixed clientele.  You can make a pass at all the people in the posse you put together over the course of the game – be they man, woman or droid. Nearly all will happily take you up on the offer, regardless of the gender-combination. My favorite exchange in this regard (paraphrased) is when you go “Hey, we shared so much, wanna add ‘casual sex’ to the list?” and your homie goes “Well, I normally don’t swing that way, but f*ck it, I’m down!” There is no depth or consequence to any of these interactions, but then consequences are not what the game is about. Mostly, this feature just pokes fun at the Mass Effect series, where you could romance your crewmates, with more gender limitations, but also with an actual effect on the story.  Saint’s Row IV is an exhilarating power fantasy – even more so than The Third. It’s not just about cathartic destruction, but also features a liberating freedom of movement. You will be running along a street at super-speed, sending cars to the left and right of you flying as you pass. You will ‘charge’ your jump as you race towards a tall building and then release the button at just the right moment to make yourself soar over it. If the building is too tall too jump over, then you just run up the side of it and jump off the top, gliding through the air to a different section of the city. I spent my first two hours of playtime just bouncing from rooftop to rooftop, collecting alluringly glowing ‘glitches’ scattered around the city, which are needed to upgrade your powers. There is something Zen-like and relaxing about it, even though you ultimately won’t want to bother collecting all 1000+ of them. The joy of simply zooming around wears off a little, but never fully goes away. I already experienced similar bounce-around collect-athons before in Prototype and Crackdown, but these were let down by the less appealing game around them. (I dropped out of both of them after a while.)  The superpowers in general are very well done. There’s telekinesis, you can send out various kinds of destructive blasts and you can punch into the ground with your first or – from the air – with your entire body, causing a variety of shockwave effects. The potential for causing mayhem is huge and you won’t have to feel morally conflicted about bystanders. Even within the videogame they aren’t real, just being part of a Matrix-like simulation you were thrown into. They’re doubly virtual. It’s just as well, as you are able to level whole cityblocks by the end of the game, if you made the effort to upgrade. I especially enjoyed the ability to set off chained explosions, which I only realised after a while was actually part of DLC I bought together with the main game (the ‘Element of Destruction Pack’). On the downside, it allows you to rip through sections of the game very quickly and without challenge. You may find yourself relying on it too much.  It’s interesting, though a bit disappointing, that the game takes your superpowers away for a lot of the main story missions, because you’d be too overpowered for them otherwise. So you’ll mostly use them within the city simulation to take over alien bases, do point-to-point races and platform your way around.  A lot of side-activities are recycled from the previous game, even if they now don’t fit all that well. Some of them wrestle you into a car to do some driving around, which feels restrictive as cars are slower than you are when running. There really doesn’t seem to be a use for cars apart from window dressing and to serve occasionally as a tool of destruction. Regardless, you can still ‘collect’ cars by driving them to a garage and upgrade them. You can also still call on homies to assist you in battle – another feature you will never need to use. But you can customize the look of these homies and upgrade them, if you want to. The superfluous stuff doesn’t detract from the experience, it just makes you wonder why it’s there.  I wouldn’t advise playing too much of the side-activities unless prompted. Most of the side-missions just have you play a selection of these activities in any case, so you will be getting an ample amount of them. And as some of them are recycled from the last game, they may feel familiar to begin with. Again taking inspiration from Mass effect 2, there are ‘loyalty missions’, to have you solidify your bond with your homies. Not completing all of these will result in a less than ideal alternate ending cutscene.  As I upgraded my graphics card between this game and its predecessor, comparing their look is tricky. But the city seemed more detailed and vibrant, full of interesting landmarks. It is mostly the same map, but feels like a wholly new experience because you’re not restricted to the roads. Sadly, the polish present in the main world is absent from the cutscenes. The lip-synching is awful at times and character animation can get a bit hokey and glitchy, especially the bits taking place on the spaceship that serves as your home base. Weirdly, your alter-ego looks better during regular gameplay. (For most of it, I made mine a dark-skinned muscleman with mutton chops, a blokey, UK voice and a Steampunk outfit.) I encountered two game-crashes when the game was switching to a cut-scene, requiring me to do part of the preceding levels again.  But apart from the actual crashes, the technical imperfections and superfluous content don’t hurt the overall experience. With its self-aware silliness, smartly stupid dialogue and plot, and a penchant for operatic destruction, Saint’s Row IV is an excellent way to blow off some steam after a stressful day.  @PopCultJunk",

There are always the generic 'capture' quests that have become a staple of the Saints Row series, but they have added more mini-games this time around including psychic throwing and Pipedream style hacking.  The developers made it easy to collect the various easter eggs especially since there is a 'find treasure' perk available halfway through the game. As a result, this is the first game in a long time that I put forth a conscious effort to complete side tasks secrets because of the in-game unlocks.  The game becomes easier as you level and unlock more perks, but even with the unlocks it is still a rewarding experience with the powers unlocked.  This is a fitting end to the series and resolves most if not all loose ends. Perhaps the biggest disappoint is that it is the conclusion to the story and we may never see this awesome cast again.",

This game however was produced by a new team of Developers with new Ideals and a chance to step into the fairly hefty shoes of THQ.  Some say that they did not do it. I on the other hand think they did an Admirable job! We are forgetting one thing, The rights were handed over for the Saints Row Franchise, this means that so was the plan for SR4, So people slagging off SR4 because 'It was not made by THQ' Can go and insert their opinion into their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and never play with it again!   I must admit though, this game was fun, and bugged me at the same time, I loved the fact I was not a Super hero with amazing map-travelling abilities and the defiance to blow an entire camp of Alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into space with a Gun spewing Dubstep which recollects as Pwetty lines on my monitor. And the ability to Shoot waves of fire from my Steampunk clothes whilst following up with an Air pound which destroyed everything within 2 Miles.   The Story of this game was also funny like it should be and also exciting! Making jokes about the modern gaming industry, Classic Gaming Industry, and so much more! Even SR2 Is mentioned in its jumbled fashion. It is very obvious this is a Saints Row game. Its comedic power is still the same as before and the Graphics though remaining the same but in a slightly different light do not downgrade its value. I can tell it is a Saints row game as I run along A space ship with a Character who resembles Natsu from Fairy tail as I ask EVERYONE I pick up on my adventures as President of the U.S.A (By the way you are president, forgot that bit) for violent sex as I giggle at the conversations they have like a 10 year old discovering that ♥♥♥♥♥♥s exist.   Its comedic value taken out of the equation though it holds a dark fact which bugged me to the limit! It was a Direct clone of An SR3 DLC which means it may not be worth your money, but I still recommend it for the story and the general playability, even though there is a mod that adds the direct super powers into SR3, SHUT UP! I'M NOT FIGHTING WITH MYSELF AGAIN!  The Radio choices are really really nice this time round with music to fit all fashions, It even plays everywhere you go as you seem to have no need for the awesome Space cars you come accross, Flying is the new fashion and it is a lot of fun to do so, Your Super jump and Sprint are amazing for manouverability and general fun-having.   So in summary this game is questionable to be bought, Get it if you have money to spare, and won't mind some new features layered above old ones, I give this game an 8/10 But See for yourself!  ",

Check! Cowboy Mayor? Check! Wrestlers fight with chainsaw? Check!) and kinda full of holes but it felt intended. Hell the characters were joking about how their choice made no sense and that everything looked like a parody.   Now Saint Row IV is a different beast. It does not has the 'we are not taking ourself seriously' atmosphere; everything is in a serious tone but it makes no sense being serious with a story of alien and virtual reality crap. The story is full of hole that are never quite explained and ends up feeling cheap and rushed out. The jokes characters along the path are not funny unless you are stuck in your pre-teen years. It ends up being quite dull.   Now the play mecanics is a bit better. The super power are interesting and add fun to the game. Unfortunately, it also ruins what was a fun part of the game in Saint Row III : the vehicles. Why would I search around trying to steal new vehicles when I can run faster than a car, run higher than a plane and run on water? Car or helicopters are useful in the first 15-30 minutes of the game assuming you found some. But after that you don't care / don't need them. Weirdly enough the missions still reward you with those until very late in the game... Worst, some late mission force you to ride car although you would be better off running. It really feel like the developers didn't think this whole super-power balance through.  The game has some minor bugs, like scene not loading, achievements not being rewarded, some guns offered has reward in two different missions. There is also a certain number of places where I was wondering 'wtf am I suppose to do' as some mecanics or mission really lacks explanations... Overall, the bugs and the lack of explanations are not that bad but it makes me feel the game was rushed and not quite tested.   It feel like the game was just rushed out. They took an old engine, they used the old characters, hell they even took the old city map of Saint Row III. Then they added some aliens, some unconvincing virtual reality crap and they called it a new game. But in the end it really feel like a big DLC. Not even a good one or a funny one.   If you were a fan of the serie, wait until it gets around 5$, this does not worth 22$ at all.  If you are new to the serie... go buy yourself Saint Row The Third. It is the same map, the same engine, the same characters BUT it is funny as hell, well made and it is fun to play. ",

The humour hasn't changed at all, which I guess isn't only a bad thing. The game looks almost the same and kind of feels the same, so what's the catch?  All the missions felt like replaying everything all over again. All the side quests were just different minigames in a different order, again and again. Fully completing all missions was a pain in the ♥♥♥, not fun at all. Only a few main missions felt exciting and fun to play, since sometimes you actually got to do something new for a change. Everything was just too damn repetitive and messy.  Maybe the worst thing about this game were the superpowers. It can be just me, but I really prefer these GTA-like games with a more 'realistic' touch. Killing enemies wasn't even a challenge anymore and all of the vehicles were just useless. There was no point in using any vehicle when you could just jump around. I liked some of the features, but at times they were either overpowered or making things that made SR3 fun only useless. For example Insurance Fraud used to be fun as hell, but now it was just pressing one button and waiting.  Even though I really shouldn't say that Saints Row's plot is the most important thing I guess we all can say that now it made even less sense than before - and only in a weird way. All the aliens and the paraller world things just felt lame. Everything that made SR3 so fun and 'random' was pushed even further to create something really unimaginative. But I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. So maybe the problem just was that the game was more like a huge DLC than a full game.  Also this may be the buggiest game I've seen for a while. Some achievements don't come at all even if all of the requirements have been fulfilled and in multiplayer the other player keeps disconnecting multiple times when playing an instance. Everything keeps teleporting and enemies may fall through floors etc. It wouldn't be a problem if it didn't happen all the time.  I don't see any replay value or anything that could keep me playing longer than the main story lasts. :D Except for the ice cream gun. And finding clusters. I really could just play SR3 and forget about this one.",

What I got was a game that was insanely easy except for the absolute final boss, which was made a little easier with a little stroke of luck and a glitch. There's a LOT of glitches in this game that I experienced, such as broken/breaking AI, Teleportation, Immortality of enemies, and enemies/homies glitching through the floor. I never really saw a need to use super powers aside from Ice Blast, aside from the forced sections (Genki's M.O.M., Cluster collection, scripted events), as they were rather lackluster and overall not very useful (Telekenesis was very hard to use, Stomp had a HUGE delay with a tiny effective radius, and Buff just never really came up as necessary).  The humor was still very tongue-in-cheek, but there's a lot of gags that require you to have knowledge of Saints Row 2 &amp; 3 in order for you to understand properly. I haven't played through Saints Row 2, so I don't know the exact instances of Veteran Child and the rest of the Vice Kings, but I did get enough from this game to get the general jist of things for what was needed.  Overall, I paid 20$ for a game that honestly felt rushed and unpolished. It's incredibly easy, the Heavy SMG just tears through enemies like butter, and overall I don't feel like it's justified of even a bargin-bin 10$ price if it ever were to go that low. Pass on this unless you get it on the cheap.",

Pros:   +Starring: God's Perfect Idiot (The President of the United States of America), ALIENS and an Awesome Crew   +Good Customization, especially the 'Personality' option - really cool and funny.  +Very Good Writing, I honestly laughed at the stupidity and jokes of the characters.  +Great Characters (Johnny Gat and Ben 'Motherf@cking' King are just awesome).  +Level Design is really good, the developers have done a really good job at creating different simulations for each crew member (some showing moments from the previous games).   +Awesome soundtrack to satisfy all tastes, you can create your own playlist in-game or just play your own music playlist from Spotify, Steam Music, etc.  +Zinyak is a witty and comedic villain but much like Handsome Jack from the 'Borderlands' series is a voice that tries to get under your skin and ends with a sort of satisfactory Final Boss fight.   +Superpowers (but they are also in the 'Cons' section).   +Driving is okay-ish.   +You can complete this game with a buddy in co-op.   +Audio Logs and the return of some characters from the previous games like Mini-Bosses.  Cons:   -For a game this ambitious it is really short (8-9 hours).  -EXTREMELY REPETITIVE Side Quests, Just the crew member that gives you the quests is different.   -Cluster Collecting feels like a chore, honestly.  -Superpowers are given waaaaay too early in the game, this kills the reason for the player to even bother getting a car, let alone customize it.  -The 'Romance' option, I honestly believe it was put for comedy value, needless to say that the cutscenes are always the same everytime you want to get laid (but I have to say the dialogue is pretty funny).  -Some powers feel useless and not fun to play with (Buff, Force Shield).  -The mini-games are honestly boring and uninspired (Except 'Fraud').     Overall: 7/10 If you want a fun time with a friend of just a few laughs, go ahead and buy BUT I do not recommend buying it at full price, at a sale for 5 Euros wouldn't be a 'bad' purchase.",

If you are about ten years old, you may find this game worthwhile, otherwise don't even touch it.

The fourth installment of the series also lacks good story and, most importantly, there's not so much cutscenes. Even the videogame and other nerd-culture references are not helping. Yes, this is one of the games which can be funny to play co-op drinking beer and chatting through Skype, but that does not make this game a good one.

            "review_text": "This game, while has a nice idea and ticks a lot of boxes for a great game, falls flat on some of the more terrible, game breaking bugs.  First of all, while doing a mission, sometimes enemies don't spawn or the NPC that you have to escort is not moving. In a challenge called Speed Rift, sometimes it is possible to lose control while running and you end up being stuck in a wall. Now this is nothing that happened only to me, I've googled these things and it appears that a lot of other people find these bugs frustrating. And the fact that Volition had so much time to fix all that and still didn't do so, is even worse.  The game is funny with over the top action, jokes, references to other games, movies or iconic characters like Metal Gear, Splinter Cell, Star Wars, Star Trek, Martian Manhunter. Also a great addition is Nolan North's voice that you can choose for your character and it feels like you're playing Deadpool at times (I guess Activision thought that it was a great idea to give whatever scraps of the voice material they didn't need for the Deadpool game).  The problem is, the side missions are mostly people asking you to do challenges, which if I wanted to do, I wouldn't play a mission in the first place. It's kind of rushed, unlike the previous games, which is sad, because parts of the game are really well done.  All in all, if you can handle the bugs and repetitive missions and want an over the top action game where you can play a super hero, then by all means, get the game (you can get the game cheaper than the original price, so I'd suggest that), otherwise, a good decision would be not to buy the game, obviously.",

The actual game when it is working isn't half bad. Lacking the lulz from previous games, and little to no imagination with the story.

Even though production was hampered while Volition/Saints Row was sold to DeepSilver, the ETD DLC feels like scribbly notes in the dev's notebooks, with voiceovers by the cast. It feels... unfinished.  2. Since SR:TT, Saints Row has shifted gears. Not a bad thing, I'm down with that. But The newer games don't seem to have the level of interaction that SR2 had. SR4 attempts to remedy this with new races and tons more activities, but I miss racing cars and buying a 40oz, hopping into a septic truck and lowering some property values. HOWEVER, they still maintain that they are fun. Which they ARE. Which is important, right?  3.Inexplicable things and untouched-upon past events. The crew tend to jabber about past events like they were yesterday but never mention specifics. What happened in Salt Lake City? What happened when the President and that reporter were caught in that room? None of it is explained/expanded upon, and it feels less like characters interacting and more like just a way to lead-in to the random task that the crew is asking you to do. Just a thought.  Overall, the game is, at it's core, fun. Which is the whole point of playing games, right?",

The weapon and vehicle customizations are almost identical to those in Saints Row the Third. The games plays out in a similar fashion to that of Saints Row the Third.  Where Saints Row IV goes wrong is by adding a 'superpower' skill deck that nullifies the need for vehicles and guns. Therefore, not only is the game long-winded in the development of its storyline, but your progress is essentially wiped clean once your super-skills reach a certain threshold: it becomes a game about a wandering Spiderman/Superman hybrid that breaks all the in-game rules to move through the tenuous, shallow storyline.  TL;DR: SR IV shatters too many illusions, and breaks too many rules to be more than a tedious sandbox playground.",

Sure, you'll use them to supplement your blasty powers but they are fairly lackluster too. Many reviewers have said that this game feels more like an expansion for SRIII than a new game, and I have to agree with them.   Ultimately its a Saints Row game in 'The Matrix'. Is it a bad game? No...I guess not, but it will probably remain the black sheep of the series if more are made.

After 20+ Hours i just wanted the game to end as fast as possible. The Mainstory is nothing special but i dont want to spoil too much. Side missions are repetetive and have no innovation whatsoever. Go there, defent that, kill X enemies, run/drive trough a specific course; the usual stuff by the dozens. You grow tired of them in no time.  Graphics are okayish, but definetly not great for the time of its release. Animations seem stiff. Controlls are also not that good if you want to play it with your keyboard &amp; mouse. Probably ok with gamepad I guess. The AI ist just stupid as hell. Buddys in sidemissions will die regularly because they are either in the mood for suicide by charging in every enemy horde they see or are just standing there doing absolutely nothing. For example I had to repeat many missions because some braindamaged npc didnt feel like getting in the car next to him but instead tried to punsh the ♥♥♥♥ out of a tank.   Its also buggy as hell. While playing the main story, some video sequences in co-op mode crashed every time while loading so we were force to skip them. That alone wouldnt be so bad if you werent also forced to play the whole level again since the game only saves after said video sequences. Since you dont know which sequences will crash and which wont while you are in your first playthrough I recommend skipping them all or bring some time and patience. Other features in the game also tend to lag tremendously or sometims just dont work at all until you start buttonsmashing till they do (call car / buddy etc.). Sometimes, they wont even work until you restart the game completely.   Co-op partners also do lose connection kinda often but i dont know if its the games or the steam servers fault. In any case as soon as somebody loses conncetion while in a quest, the quest will be marked als failed for every other player and hast to be restarted. There is no option to rejoin in a quest, and many times non at all until you restart the whole game.    The whole game just feels bulky and unfinished. A year more in development and this game could have been good but at this state, it simply isnt. Its definetly not worth the money its currently priced.

The game play is fine and i actully get higher fps than on saints row 3. also the super power thing is awsome, if they just added more missions and super powers to saints row 3 i would be content.",

I liked Saints Row the Third, but the Fourth just feels like sluggish and warmed up version of it.

And honestly, the jokes in Saints Row IV are so bad sometimes that you start thinking that the authors might suffer from a mental or behavioural disorder.

The on screen prompts sometimes change between keyboard controlls to gamepad controls during gameplay.   The graphics are not fantastic even when using higher end components. Black pixelated areas occasionally will show up on my screen.  I have run into a few glitches already which is dissapointing for a game this old. The first glitch happened during the very first mission while manning the AA gun. One of the alien ships was stuck behind a tree and was not able to be shot.

So I actually don't make use of tuning and the garage. - If you don't like this nonsens humor this isn't for you, but the story is strong enough to get away with this. - Low textures on characters especially with quick time events - No dinosaurs or did i miss those, i did not finish the game yet? - Would love too see a multiplayer open world or a 4-person co-op",

And the fact that you can literally go from 0% to 100% all in co-op with a friend just makes it 100x better.   Smooth, stylistic graphics? Yep.  Fun, varied mission selection? Yep.  Tight, fluid controls? Yep. Well-optimized for PC? Yep.  Insane level of customization? Yep.  Awesome dialogue and story? Yep.  Fantastic co-op implementation? Yep.  Fun and addictive gameplay? Yep.  Nice music collection? Yep.   I just don't even know. Look at the reception on Steam, it says it all. If I had to name a few gripes, it's that the game didn't balance the time it takes to unlock the powers as well as they could've (you sorta get them a little too quick) and this makes one element of the game (driving vehicles) completely redundant and unnecessary, but you'll soon get over it once you see how fun it is to super-jump and glide across the city with ease.   Currently SR2 is still my favorite in the series, but it's a shame that the PC port was horrible because it was done by an external studio and they ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. Good thing I played it mainly on PS3. But this game is still a more-than-worthy entry in the series and righted many of the wrongs brought forth by the terrible story from the third game.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Good Co-op, good progression, fun activities, good story, Super powers. Overall 8.5/10  What can i possibly say about this game? Well first of all, before i actually played the game i thought it was stupid how the game added super powers to Saints Row, I had played SR: The Third and was completely aware about the shenanigans that would come with SR4 but that's just one thing i didn't really like about the game. Another reason i wasn't interested in SR4 was due to the ending of SR3. When i had purchased SR4 i had went into the game with very low expectations and you'll get to see my opinion on the game.  First of all let me start with this --&gt; You're the president of the US *The president of the United Saints* which is pretty badass.  The plot is introduced in the first few missions which compared to the other SR games i didn't really like but hey I bought this game because i'm bored of GTA this game is in no way comparable to any of the GTA games.  After revealing the plot all the things i didn't like about the game seemed to vanish, since you don't actually live in the real city of Steelport you're living in a simulation of Steelport made by the alien bad guy antagonist, which really makes me feel better about the whole idea of superpowers.   The comedy in the game is pretty hilarious, it's much better than the SR3 comedy was, it's got a lot of moments that really make me laugh.   Since i'm me there is one selling point on the game and that is: Upgrades and character progression. All of your guns have things to upgrade such as explosive ammo, fire rate, damage, recoil, RoF, it's all really cool, The penetrator remains in the game which deep down makes me happy knowing i can run around Steelport F*ing people in the face with my giant ♥♥♥♥♥ bat. Cars can also be upgraded and pimped out in the same way as previous SR games, although the reliance on vehicles is much lower due to the first two super powers you get. As you play through the game you can collect Data Clusters which allow you to upgrade your super powers, although they don't require much searching they're still really cool to collect and upgrade your powers with. And lastly you can upgrade you character himself/herself in the same way you did in SR3 collect Cache *money* and level up via missions and activities to unlock new upgrades.  Co-Op for once in a SR game Co-op is a key point to the game, without playing co-op it's impossible to achieve 100% game completion. If you're anti-social and hate people it's not the game for you. But, if you've got a friend to play it with it'll be one of the best game purchases you can make.   Overall the game is pretty damn good i'd give it a solid 8.5/10 So far i don't have many complaints it's a really good game. Grab a friend and rip through the Co-op. The game is totally worth the 20$",

            "review_text": "I bought Saints Row 2, Saints Row the Third, and Saints Row IV all at the same time when they were on sale, and played them in order. Saints Row IV is easily my favorite of the three, despite bringing back SRtT's slightly limited character customization and the terribly designed city of Steelport (deliberately ♥♥♥♥♥♥ city-planning is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ city-planning).   Fortunately, very early in the game you obtain super powers, and the joy and rush of power from being able to sprint faster than you can drive and leaping over buildings allowed me to quickly look past those shortcomings. The ability to access the in-game radio stations even when not in a vehicle is a nice touch as well (and necessary, as you probably won't bother with conventional automobiles, boats, or planes).  I also appreciate that this game managed to balance out Shaundi's personality. The shift from mostly useless stoner in SR2 to hardass ♥♥♥♥♥ in SRtT (who, ironically, was kidnapped more times in that game) swings back to more of a middle ground in IV when she literally comes face to face with herself. Her character arc feels as though the writers are specifically attempting to address complaints about how she was written in the past.   A potential negative to players who haven't experienced the previous installments is that the Saints Row series is loaded with callbacks and has a high degree of continuity from game to game that isn't explained. SRIV does do a little better about this than previous games, as the personal hell simulations the player has to rescue their crew from are essentially flashbacks to previous events, and one type of collectibles in this game are audio logs filling in backstory and character insight.  I've seen a lot of complaints that the increasing ridiculousness of the franchise is a betrayal of its gritty roots, but I prefer the growing absurdity and sense of fun that Saints Row IV embraces rather than a game like Saints Row 2, which might be described as 'like GTA, but... with funny outfits, I guess.'",

A true gangster SR game would've been critized for being a Grand Theft Auto rip-off,even if it wasn't. And it would need to compete with GTA,which SR frankly can't win. The obvious choice here was to distance themselves from realism and play around with superpowers and aliens. Yeah,you read that right. You become the president of the USA,you get abducted by aliens and you get thrown into a simulation where you get superpowers. And it works.  --Story-- I'll keep it short,because I don't want to spoil anything. It somehow still has dramatic moments. It also has extremely funny moments. All in all,a suprisingly good story.  Now for just the Pros and Cons:  --PROS-- +Superpowers. They work great,are not that overpowered and are extremely fun. +Progression. You can level up and spend your cash on player upgrades,or find ''orbs'' and spend those on superpower upgrades. And the end of the game,you really feel like you've accomplished something. +Customization. Although many people think the vehicles are now useless because of the superpoweres,customizing them is even more fun now. You can also upgrade weapons,and the charachter creator and clothes selection are sublime as ever. +Humor. This game is really funny. That's all i'm going to say. +Co-op. Playing this game with 2 people is even more fun than playing on your own.  +Fun factor. This game doesn't forget what games are about: fun. Realism is thrown out the window for pure fun. And believe me,this game is a LOT of fun.  --CONS-- -Vehicles. Many people believe vehicles are now useless. They are,don't get me wrong,but I still like driving them around. Still,they are pretty useless. -Not gangster. I personally don't think this is a con,but i'll include it because plenty of people think it is.   --CONCLUSION-- Completely insane amounts of fun. If you don't mind unrealistic games,this is a must-buy.",

People who say it's glorified DLC are correct. SR3 was my favorite installment and MUCH superior to this game. It's fun, sure, but the short storyline, lack of activities, and lack of immersion (especially since you're pretty much a one-man army and only you and Kinzie really interact at all) kind of brought the game to its knees at times.

However, you don't kill a single human being in the entire game. Yep, you heard that right. My gleeful sociopath didn't kill one human. The whole game takes place in a simulation where nothing is real. I mean, it's not real anyway, but at least it's not usually fake *in the game*. What's the point of being a god-like gangster if I can't accidentally kill a few civilians?  Also, the complete reuse of Steelport actually makes the game feel kind of unfinished. It's almost more like an expansion or a very big DLC than a standalone game. Most of my time is spent in the same area as in Saints Row: The Third, which is still the best of the series. Sure, superpowers let me see it from a new perspective, but it's kind of strange to play in exactly the same areas as in the last game.  SRIV has the same port problems as SR3. It's slow, even on a very good computer, and recommends the highest settings when it lags on anything short of low. Many people complain about this, and I can play much better games on my computer without a hitch. It's too bad, because the game looks pretty good most of the time.  Adding loyalty missions to go with the open-world missions actually brings a nice structure to it. Plus, adding bronze-silver-gold gives new options to shoot for without compromising success in the loyalty missions. It's the one advantage it has over SR3.  So, basically, a very good game. I loved it, played every mission, and then never touched it again. It's worth the price.  Score: 8/10",

Lots of humans were abducted and are now enslaved, with their minds connected to a computer simulation of Earth, much like The Matrix. So you, as the President, will spend most of the time in this simulation, where you will acquire superpowers while fighting the aliens in their tron-like vehicles. So... it´s a GTA-like game, with a Matrix plot, and pieces of Tron visual? Yes, exactly! Awesome, heh? And the soundtrack is also awesome. You don´t have to be inside a car to listen to it. To walk in the city with that huge alien mothership in the skyline, listening to a soundtrack like a end of the world party, it´s a pretty cool experience.",

            "review_text": "  Speaking as someone who has only played 'Saint's Row the Third' and this one, I can safely say this is one of the best games I have ever played.   It is such an enjoyable experience there is no person I would not reccomend this to. Coming off 'Saint's Row the Third', I was enjoying my time with the franchise, but it didn't stand out to an amazing degree, but this game took everything I hated about 3, fixed it, and added in all new things to enjoy.    So why is it so good?   Well, I'll start with the central combat mechanics, which I would say are overall better than in 3, with a ton more weapon variety, including all sorts of crazy and amazingly fun weapons, including the Dubstep Gun and the Black Hole Launcher (My personal favorite!), though alot of the more ordinary guns feel alot weaker than in 3. For example, the Alien SMG felt more like it was firing air powered brussel sprouts than laser shots. Also, I feel the weapon balance is a bit off. Though it may be really fun, and I definately prefer it to the alternative, from a technical standpoint, I shoud not be able to one shot with a completely unimproved melee weapon, recovering all lost health from a pickup he drops. Later on, I would clear entire flashpoints with nothing but a tentacle bat or a laser sword. Combat also includes the brand new superpowers, which are mostly really fun to play around with, and can do some real damage. However, I think alot of powers are either useless, or made obsolete by other powers. Why would I shoot a fireball at one enemy when I can surround myself in a temporary aura of fire, burning all nearby enemies as I get them well acquainted with my tentacle?  Alot of people point at the character customization in 2 as being incredible, and say they were dissappointed in customization in 3 and 4. Having very briefly played 2, I can say there is such a thing as too much detail, and that has it. 4 has plenty of choices to make whatever character you want, including different voices with different dialogue, though I found the developers really didn't put a whole lot of effort into the voices other then Male Voice 1 and maybe Male Voice 2, since, in my first playthrough as Female Voice 1, the subtitles constantly said something different to my character, which is a minor complaint, but it really annoyed me. Another complaint is they didn't seem to build on the wardrobe from 3, and rather replaced it, so alot of clothes I liked from before are gone, in favor of four of the same fedora with a slightly different rim.   Until I heard complaints about it and actually took a good look at the map, I couldn't even tell it was Steelport again. The jump and sprint powers make travel so much fun for awhile, though it did eventually become routine, and that verticality to moving on foot makes it feel like a different city, at least to me. However, that hits upon one of my main complaints: cars. In 3, cars were vital, and in 4, they added tons of new cars, most of which are incredibly interesting and funny in concept and execution. There's a ♥♥♥♥ing man-a-pult, for God's sake! However, I was almost never tempted to use vehicles of any kind, since traveling on foot was so much faster and more efficient, which is a real shame, because vehicles seem so interesting. The problem is really exemplified whenever a mission requires you drive around and you realize how much you want to get out, jump into the air, and dive nuke a city block.    *YOU MAY FIND SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH*   The story is honestly pretty shallow in its broad concept. Break the simulation by doing activities while rescuing your crew. It's a means to an end, but alot of the individual missions, particularly the rescue missions are very fun, though many of the normal missions are very very repetitive and even kind of 'grindy', you could say, which is one of the biggest criticisms of the game by most. But all these missions present a bonding experience to get you to care about each and every character, and that's really the games strongest point: the characters. I absolutely love every character in this game. They are all well defined, and the game lets you spend casual bonding time with each one to make you actually enjoy having them around, not to mention every one is enjoyable in their own way. I'd imagine this would be rapidly trumped in a story-focused game, but as someone who hasn't been exposed much to those, one of my favorite character moments came in this game, and it was when Pierce and the Boss start singing along to the radio during a mission. The dialogue, humor, and sense of absolute careless fun from the voice actors makes it a scene with not much depth, but just a flat out good time, a scene that just makes you feel happy and invested, which is really what games are about, right? And the ending. I ended up getting the good ending first time, and it is such a good ending. No poetic depth, no thought-provoking parting message, no final riddle, but just a good, light-hearted ending that made you feel accomplished and all warm inside, seeing the characters have just a good a time as you.  Switching over to the other main strength, let's talk about the humor. This game is filled with absolutely hillarious moments. One big complaint I have about 3 is it really just has one joke: ♥♥♥♥♥, BUMS, ♥♥♥♥, SEX, GET IT, IT'S FUNNY RIGHT?, which can be good when done right and in moderation, but was seriously overdone. This game has references, parodies, that oh so random humor that's fun when done right, which it is here, original dialogue humor, and it still retains that dirty humor from 3, but in a much better balance with the rest of it to make those jokes consistently funny. The dialogue is amazing, and I willingly listened to all of it and wanted more just because it was so good.  In conclusion, I highly reccomend this game. Sure there are some goods and bads I left out, but I think this covers the important points, at least in my experiences. It had plenty of flaws and missed alot of potential in alot of its elements, but the action, powers, characters, and humor in this game, combined with an obvious sense of absolute dedication to fun has this game stand out as being superb, and I truly cannot understand how people would rather have some dark and serious 'Grand Theft Auto' clone over this gem.",

It isn't a bad game at all, I just think that not everyone is going to enjoy it because of how it changed compared to previous game in the series  TL;DR: If you like superheroes or w/e you clearly gonna enjoy it.

            "review_text": "This review comes from someone who has played Saints Row 3 and loved it very much. The reasons why I gave this game a negative review are as follows : 1) The concept of 'Aliens attack the earth' feels very generic. 2) Though you have a wide variety of super powers to play around with most of them like ice blast and fire are nothing new.  3) Most of the Main Quests take place 'OUTSIDE' of Steelport city/Simulation. The city is just there for you to play around with your superpowers on your own and completing the rinse and repeat side quests. 4) Talking about side quests they go like : ' Meet .... on the ship'   - Disrupt the system  - Race throught the system  - Clear out the zin troops  - Inject virus  ' Meet ....... to get your reward'   This goes on and on until they think they had enough of you. The same objectives over and over and over again.And you need to complete them to unlock powers and weapons. Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity.  5) All your homies refer to you as 'Boss' and make you work like a slave in the side quests above. This game badly suffers from 'You are the only one who is competent' cliche. 6) The tough decisions that we need to do at the end of some Major Quests in SR3 are no more there. The text adventure section of SR3 is replaced by a more boring and stupid one, in one of the missons.  Overall, this game may seem fun if you watch the videos. The superpowers may look cool at first. But the novelty wears off very soon as you don't get to use in them in the Main Quests. The only place where they are actually used are in the boring and repetitive side quests and when you are on your own. ",

In all honesty, yes whilst fun to play, the entire thing sounds like it was more in the SR bosses head rather then an actual event, thats all i can think this was, a hallucination or some sort of drug induced wierdness or maybe Saints Flow was tainted... i dont know.

            "review_text": "Obtaining Saints Row 4 without Steam in my Country (Germany) is pretty much asking for a quick execution of yourself, because it's been censored quite a bit and pretty difficult to get if you don't have something like GameStop in the area. However, i managed to get it now through Steam and playing it, soon i realized that this censoring kind of had a point. If the game wasn't censored like this, it might encourage people to do some insane irresponsible stuff, like shooting fire from their hands, jumping 40 meters into the air or  going into politics .  After he (or, in your backward-Universe, she) saves the world from terrorists, the leader of the 3rd Street Saints becomes the president of the United States and starts running the country into the ground so hard that it tunnels through and ends up under China. Then Aliens attack, kidnap you and seal you into a computer simulation of Steelport from Saints Row 3. Very kind of the Aliens to spare the Developers the task of designing a new Sandbox! But it is actually okay, because the game uses the old Sandbox for new Gameplay elements along the lines of Prototype, complete with the ability to make a dive, face front, into a tank and destroying it - along with pretty much everything in the general area.  Whereas the first Saints Row games were silly, but still grounded in some realism, like Saints Row 2 was, Saints Row 4's relationship with Realism is a quick farewell-kiss before drinking drug-infused Fanta out of a clown's shoe and skyrocketing onto the backside of Mars. Within the first half hour, Saints Row 4 managed to parody Call of Duty, Armageddon, Independence Day, The Matrix and Space Invaders without a single breather. But it's still more grounded than Saints Row 3 was. No, seriously, i mean it! Saints Row 3 was always going up and down between Saints Row 2's 'silly crime Sandbox' and Saints Row 4's 'bats**t-s**tting-bats-crazy drug trip', and as such it couldn't quite decide on a tone it wants to have.  Saints Row 4 now has accomplished the Task that began with Saints Row 2, which is cleaning off the dirt that marked the Saints Row games as a „Subpar GTA Knockoff“. However it is weird that the Game reminisces so much about the stuff we've finally gotten rid of, with characters from each previous Saints Row game. However, the „Subpar GTA Knockoff“ is now completely rinsed off from this game, which now reveals the game's wacky comedy, which can only be judged by whether the game made me laugh or not. Well, it generally made me laugh, simply because of the fun you have by beating people up with an oversized wobbling sex toy, and the dialogue between the characters is, as always, hilarious to listen to, and some of the parodies work. However it does fall flat at times. Entire sections of the game attempt to make fun of popular games nowadays, but fail to understand the difference between a Parody and a Reference, just like Duke Nukem Forever. One brief chapter is entirely devoted to mock Metal Gear Solid, complete with a cardboard box, inside which you hide to then take out guards from behind, but that's not a joke! It's just what you do in Metal Gear Solid. If you mock through imitation, at least put on a silly face while doing so, or, even better, kick them between the legs!  Saints Row 4 also gets a fair share of licensed music! The Prologue is accompanied by that one Aerosmith song from the Armageddon soundtrack, that just about everyone tearfully admits is kind of alright, and there are other examples, usually to positive effect, but i eventually relaized that they only did this because they made a Sandbox with cars and Radio stations, only to figure out that there's no reason whatsoever to use cars. But even this was cleverly solved by having the radio always available, vehicle or not.  The Game gives you those Superpowers i talked about earlier right at the start (kind of), and then spends the entire story mode regretting this, because all the story missions have some weird reason for your powers to not work, making you wonder why you even spend upgrades on them. The Final Boss however is a great Superpower-Brawl that rounds things up well. Another thing i really liked is that you can get health back from killing enemies, which keeps the pace up, whereas in previous games all you could do was duck and cover and wait for blood to fall off your face. But for some reason, this power is removed during the Final Boss, so it goes back to hiding and sucking on your thumb.  Overall, the Game has a lot of stuff, a Sandbox with Superpowers and vehicles, wacky comedy, Sci-Fi-action, game parodies, a lot of Gameplay features being thrown in, used once and then thrown away, and character customization that even Skyrim would be jealous at. Taken as a whole, the Game is a complete mess, but as the end of a series that has always been moving to the point of maximum mess it does its job pretty well. It is a mess, but it's also a lot of fun! This is how all Video Game series' should end: A big, massive, over-the-top roast of itself, and of video games in general, exploding into everything the series does best. Salute it, with the wobbliest sex toy you can find!",

To me, the game initially seemed like a re-skinned night-time version of SR3...with aliens. But play further and it turns out there's been plenty of gameplay changes for the better. Missions are now grouped more tidily, challenges make more sense while acitvities and side missions now feel more purposeful. Of course the hallmark of SRIV is the addition of new powers for the Saints. The immense kinds of superpowers you get makes travelling across the, albeit same, city of Steelport so much less of a chore to do. The freedom you get is something possibly unmatched by any other sandbox, well, maybe apart from Just Cause 2. Screw the need for superhero games. Wanna fly like Superman, run like the Flash, stomp like the Hulk? You get it all here. However, that is not to say having all these powers is simply too amazing. Despite the removal of certain... OP skills, enemies are still flat-out easy and it makes me wonder if Volition wanted the game to be this easy. There's also a certain stiffness to the way the animations and AI work in the game, something that might leave you with a feeling of reptitiveness in playtime eventually.  At its best, it's the story missions of the game that makes up for the worth. The overall premise of the game starts about your Saint being president, though this event is very short-lived, when alien baddies attack, the White House gets blown up and you become a nobody again. What's shown in the game promos can be a little misleading because of this; being the president for about the first five minutes of the game? Yeah..that's about it.  The rest of the game pits you against Zinyak and friends in a struggle to save humanity from them evil do-ers. To do that, you'll have to rescue back the Saints, making them crew members on your ship, where you can talk to them...and romance them. Sounds familiar? Clearly seems like the devs intended this to be a mocking yet a splitting rip-off from the Mass Effect series. On the surface, that's what it is. But the playthrough itself is entirely different. You'll go through the craziest adventures including 2D retro beat-em-ups, battle a giant soda can called Paul and jump back and forth into different dimensions like a recreation of the 1950s. It's hard to take it seriously, and sometimes you might even forget what the f**** the story is supposed to be. So despite some of its shortcomings, I guess it's the main missions that's what truly carries SRIV to the front.",

            "review_text": "The first Saints Row game was nothing more than a cheap knock off, I liked the 80's metal soundtrack in the game but that was all it had going for it. The second game is when things got entertaining, they just started to parodize the whole gang thing a lot more and poke fun at some relevant societal topics. But the third game is when Volition really started to have fun poking fun at how weird the real world was. Saints Row: The Third wasn't only fun to play but the way it poked fun at the reality tv craze, and Stag was obviously a jab at how Bush handled the war on terror, and it was all done in a very National Lampoon way which was amusing. Well Saints Row IV, it merely picks up where they left off in three and takes even mroe jabs at a lot of the absurd things in the US, and it pays homage to so many things from the 80's you'll lose count. There's the level that totally pays homage to They Live and a Christmas Story (briefly), and then there's tons of weapons from 80's classics like Robocop, Aliens, and GI Joe. And the christmas expansion, the first level is basically a re-creation of the old studio lot where they shot Jaws, Gremlins, and numerous other classics. But towards the end when it pays homage to the animated Transformers film, and even uses the Stan Bush song from the film, that was just a golden moment in the game.  But I'm praising the satire and how they paid homage to so many great films and cartoons and not talking about the gameplay. Gameplay wise the game is pretty fun and the super powers the player can use in the viritual world add a whole new level of gameplay to the franchise since in earlier games, the player had to rely on vehicles to get anywhere fast and always rely on guns or grenades, but in the 4th game the player could still go the gun and grenade route or freeze people or turn them into gold or use telekenisis and throw them into the sky. In short, the game allows players to just go crazy when it comes to taking out pedestrians and the aliens. The controls are as smooth as the third game, which I'm thankful for since Saints Row 2 for the PC, the driving controls were just horrible. If one enjoys open world games where they can just go crazy, this game should please them. But I highly recommend getting the Game of the Century version, or at the very least the base game and the christmas expansion pack. While I adore Volition's sense of humor when it comes ot the SR franchise, Enter the Dominatrix gets a little too corny, while the Christmas expansion is hands down a far better expansion pack. I don't recommend playing any of the expansions until after finishing the main game though since the expansions will spoil a few things otherwise.  However, while I think the game is highly entertaining and totally worth dropping 10-20 on, it does have its flaws and they're the same exact flaws the third game had.  1. The game doesn't have the cool drug and booze thing from the second game, I found it highly amusing how the character could get drunk or stoned in the second game and was sad to see them ditch the ability to do that in the third and fourth. To be fair, it could have been because some countries ban games with drug content, like Australia.   2. The really cool interior locations like the mall in Saints Row 2 added a lot of fun to the game, it was a blast to ♥♥♥♥ off the security guards and then just cause tons of trouble. But Saints Row 3 and 4 just don't have any of those types of interior locations, which is a shame.   3. The player can still play in the water in three and four but it doesn't take long to notice the water isn't used by any of the npc's like in the 2nd game. There aren't any npc's jet ski'ing or driving boats or anything like that, the water is just lifeless.   If Saints Row 5 brings back just 1 or 2 of those three things, I'll love it to pieces.",

The character customization is a really nice feature; you can customize every little thing about your character, the jaw line, the eyes, the overall face shape, body type etc. and even voice.

I really liked the previous one (SR The Third), but this one introduced new elements, improved visual effect and a lot of new characters, not excluding the old ones. Sincerely, I don't have any negative stuff to say about this game, maybe just the sounds that weren't working at some points- but that might be just from my mods/game install- and maybe the glitches, even though those were funny as well. I really like these series, and personally, I think it's better than GTA. It gave me a relaxing feeling and I don't think there wasn't a time when I didn't enjoy the game to the fullest. Basically: -&gt; awesome visual effects -&gt; decent characters and speech lines -&gt; you can adjust the game with mods to your liking -&gt; glitches (most are entertaining and funny) -&gt; possible sound problems -&gt; funny weapons (some are quite weird) -&gt; entertaining soundtracks while doing quests My recommandation: get it; you'll enjoy every bit of it.

Although you don't   have   to in order to understand the story, you will get to see the backstory of the characters. For example, in Saints Row: The Third, you get to see the backstory of Matt Miller, Josh Birk, Phillipe Loren, and Kinzie Kensington. In addition, if you play the other stories first, you will get attached to the characters. Although some charactersrecieve unfortunate fates:    Oleg and Josh Birk.    But either way,   in my opinion   this game is quite possibly the best Saints Row game, despite what other say.

The soundtrack is really sweet and is especially fantastic in the final missions. That finale raises the hair on my neck of just how awesome it really is.  One of the strongest suits the game has is just how funny the writing is. I've never played a game before which made me laugh this much since Conkers Bad Fur Day. But beware, there's tons of referential humor, and I suggest seeing the movie They Live before finishing the game or even before playing it. There are many many more movies to see to understand the rest of the jokes, but They Live is probably the most important.

Neither 3 nor 4 struck me as especially difficult. 3 more than made up for it in fun. I enjoyed 4, but it just wasn't the same. Part of what makes 3 so enjoyable is that you're still connected to the open world genre mainstays like the GTA series -- you're doing crazy versions of street crime and working your way up the ladder. Saints Row 3 is really an amazing entry into that genre.  In 4, you very quickly become so overpowered that all the core concepts fall apart. You're not climbing the street crime ladder, and the replacement concept doesn't logically explain why the game would unfold gradually. Battles are extremely formulaic and repetitive without being fun or new or difficult. You end up bypassing all battles you don't have to fight because they are just boring.  The much hyped special gun was a massive letdown for me. Like most of the novelty guns, you use it a couple times for fun, then you've really seen everything there is to see.  That said, I enjoyed the game. I pre-ordered it at full retail based purely on how much I enjoyed SR3. I don't regret that, but I stick by my recommendation: get Saints Row 3 instead of this, then make a decision on how much you're willing to wager on whether you'll enjoy SR4.",

The gfx is just like SR3, doesn't bother me, but it has to be noted. Some game mechanics are obsolete. The whole garage and vehicle driving thing will be skipped due to superpowers being superior to driving 99% of the time.

Similarly, your characters new super-powers are progressively unlocked through the game, but there are a few classics that you will likely rely on. While Steelport is the same, the ability matrix-esque ability jump and fly gives you a different angle on familiar locales.

I came into this franchise on SR3, so I feel like i missed a lot of inside humor directed to those who played the first and second games. Also half the people you spend time interacting with were from the previous games, so I highly recommend you dont play this if you havent played other games in the series. I just got SR2 just so I can feel like I can get the part of the story I'm missing / or just apathetic to because I dont have any character development behind it. Also, this game took 1/2 as long to beat as sr3 for me, and it quickly becomes a repetative shooter, but you can jump 1/2 mile high in the air. Last note: once you establish your superpowers you will lose all desire to drive, so the game is has really deviated from its gta like user experience.

Although the main story feels more like 'Go do diversion A, B, and C, THEN do something that looks original'. Cars (and planes/helicopters when you upgrade enough) are pretty much useless in this game unless you're doing a diversion that requires them. Volition also stepped up the insanity in this to the point where it's mostly creepy now (Candy Cane Penetrator...really?). Although that's the charm (if you want to call it that) of the Saints Row series.   I give this game a solid buy for Saints Row fans. If you feel skeptical about the superpowers and you have Saints Row the Third, get the Trouble with Clones DLC. Even though it'll only give you that one power for a limited time, it's still a nice, albeit short, introduction to superpowers in Saints Row. On a scale of 0 (totally abhorent) to 5 (Brilliant), I give Saints Row a 4.",

Saints Row IV has a adequate storyline that may have you on the edge of your seat, depending if you're easily impressed. Once you beat the storyline and side quests, and DLC's if you buy them, you'll need to download mods to make the game fun. IdolNinja, the community manager for Volition (company that developed all of the Saints Rows), makes great mods, including a mod that can get vehicles that are in the game's files, but not in-game. He has also made a mod to customize aircraft. The list goes on and on.  Now the co-op aspect definitely makes the game fun. If you're picky picky with cheats though, only play with friends.

Run over cars and build up your notoriety until powerful enemies show up, then blow them to smithereens with your rocket launcher and dubstep gun, and if that doesn't do it for you, there's mini-games that reward you handsomely for creating as much carnage as possible.",

I don't know how they crammed so many satires of so many major games in there, and yet built something so unique. For example, the jump-and-fly is so close to the Arkham series, but so much its own incredibly fun invention. Worth it for the minigame commentaries, the romance options, and the classical radio station; and that's just the start.",

            "review_text": "This game was a delightful romp. It's down right silly most of the time, but that's what give this game it's charm. In Saints Row the Third, this series stopped taking itself seriously and really took off with over-the-top action movie silliness. It just kept going right off the deep end and beyond in this game. I don't think it's quite as good as Saints Row the Third, but if you played the other saints row games and liked them, this game does a good job of tying the series together. It's not so much an epic conclusion, but more of a reunion / farewell party. It looks back the earlier Saints Row games, with lots of cameo appearances from other characters and villans, and even older versions of characters who changed over the course of the Saints Row games. I might have been a little let down paying full price for this game, but it's definately a fun game if you can catch it on sale.   (Spoilers beyond this point)  This game gives you super powers, similar to the Crackdown games. Pretty early in the game, you get the ability to super run and jump over tall buildings, so getting around in any type of vehicle becomes obsolete fairly quickly. I totally missed out on listening to the in game radio stations, because I was never in a vehicle long enough to listen to anything. Some of the super powers actually made it awkward to try and car jack a vehicle. After I got the upgrade to my super-run that sucks objects along with you as you run past, I found trying to run up to a car and jack it, I would usually send it flying. At that point, all you can do is say 'screw it, I'll just fly there,'.   The super powers can be really fun to play with, though. Telekinesis lets you pick up objects and enemies and throw them around. You can hurl fireballs, or jump 10 storeys high and crash down on your enemies with a powerful stomp. There are a few missions you do where your super powers get temporarily disabled, but I didn't find a way to toggle them on and off when you're just playing around freely. That might have been a good option to have, because sometimes all the super powers are unsporting.  ",

Perhaps a better word is ridiculous, or hilarious. The game play is akin to the Grand Theft Auto series, with a twist. Instead of being in an urban, open world environment, you find yourself in a simulation - Saints Row IV takes a certain amount of inspiration from the Matrix series. Earth has been destroyed by aliens - enter the evil, yet scholarly English gentleman Zinyak - and it's up to the Saints to destroy the invaders by causing mayhem and completing quests. This is where the game shines - you're able to build up super powers, from jumping multiple stories into the air, to flying, to running at the, well, speed of a bullet, to shooting fireballs, ice chunks, using telekinesis, doing incredible damage via Hulk-like stomps, among others. This is on top of the slew of weapons at your disposal, including a 'Dub Step' gun which causes both enemies and humans within the simulation to break it down.  Pick up this game if, for no other reason, than the comic relief. Go play in traffic and chuckle as the Boss laments what is left of his kidneys - while wearing (should you choose) some of the most absurd clothing options in a game to date.

Co-op is still great and all, but is way buggier this time around -- my partner in crime has actually gotten his save more or less corrupted a couple of times. Keeping your current and completed quests in sync is kind of a headache, especially in the odd case where it doesn't even want you to do the quest in co-op. But hey, it's still superpowered mayhem with a friend, so you can't hate it too hard.  Car customization is still in, even though most players will probably rarely even use vehicles once they're 15 minutes into the game. They quite improved the color finishes, too. There's also a degree of weapon customization, which is pretty swank if you ask me. Character customization is at least as robust as 3, and you can even just import your SR3 characters if you've set up your online whatnots right, though some of your wardrobe items might no longer exist (I went through the intro mission shirtless, which was actually strangely appropriate).  There's as much Saints Row humor as ever, and also kind of a lot of referential humor this time around, which is all good and well for me. Basically the game is an escalation of the same old, which is... well, pretty much what you want it to be. It still knows exactly what it is, and it's still fun as heck.",

While the humor in SR3 tickeled the 12-year-old part of my brain, there are many truly funny parts in the sequel. On the downside, much of the environment is just a slight modification of the map from SR3. On the upside, most of the development effort seems to have gone into creating an interesting, entertaining story with many memorable moments. A multitude of small touches on top of fairly well-written dialogue shows the team was really invested in making a great product rather than just cranking out a sequel.  Outside of the story, SR4 is not significantly different from SR3 which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on how much you enjoyed SR3. The biggest difference in gameplay comes from the new abilities your character has. This gives combat a new dimension but in many cases you'll likely just pick your favorite power and use it over and over again. The downside to the new abilities is that they make cars, planes, and helicopters a pretty uncompelling choice for travel or combat. On the other hand, the ADD part of your brain will appreciate being able to move quickly from mission to mission rather than playing the 'carjack then squeeze between traffic' minigame so prevalant in sandbox games. However, the Saints Row series has combat that seems geared toward the intoxicated gamer, so dwelling on the particulars seems like missing the point. While SR4 is definitely a 'console port,' there are some nice graphic options which help ease the sting of some pretty basic character models and astoundingly low-resolution textures. Another nod to the PC gaming crowd is flawless and instant transition from from gamepad to keyboard + mouse. I personally experienced a sound bug that never got patched and the game crashed a few times, but austosave combined with the ability to save at almost any point kept this from spoiling my fun. While the game is open-ended, the quests drive the action and the action moves quickly. The game is full of fun and ridiculous things to do, but the well-paced storyline will lead you through thirty or forty hours of gameplay before you even pause to wonder how many brain cells have died as a result of playing this very stupid and entertaining game.",

While I enjoyed the game, being able to unlock unlimited everything, as you could as well in SR3, turned the game into a no-loss situation. What kept people playing this game, in my opinion, was the humor. Everything in the game was turned into a crude joke and people, including myself, enjoyed that. Basically, everything you can apply to Saints Row: The Third can be applied here. Check out my review on that game if you get the chance.   One slight mistake I noticed in the game was the mis-matching challenge medal times. I have a screenshot highlighting it as well. It's very slight but prevalent enough, since you do a lot of challenges in the game, that it bothered me. You couldn't figure out how fast you had to be or how much money you needed to achieve certain medals.  One other issue that really bothered me is that SRIV is basically SR3 with a new story. They could have sold the game as a large expansion to SR3 but decided to sell it as a standalone, I'm guessing to boost sales. All the assets and graphics are the same. It's basically like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas but without any of the major gameplay additions that New Vegas had and created by the same studio but published by different companies. Yes, there are superpowers now but, that's the only major addition.  All in all, I enjoyed the crude humor and god-like gameplay but, I will probably not be playing it again casually as I have already finished the story and all challenges.",

What they did change however is the core mechanics of the game: Think 'Matrix' here. You are basically and overpowered 'Neo' that can run faster than a car, jump higher than an helicopter and hit harder than a tank. So, what is the problem you ask?  Well, this renders the vehicles AND guns pretty pointless. In fact, you would do best not to use any vehicles at all since running pretty much is faster and easier. Same goes for weapons. You can hit and throw the opposition with so much power that a rifles becomes unnecessary. After about halfway thru the game, it became clear to me that being OP is not fun! And the game setting, a computer simulation, allow the DEV team to take the easy way out when it comes to what is realistic and what is not. Example: When you throw someone out of a vehicle, it just warp outside it without animation.  If you played the third game, then I would suggest you stick with it or go look somewhere else. If you did not play SR3, pick it before you pick this one. I assure you, 3 is bigger than 4 in this case!",

Up till now the saints games have been straight and serious in tone (with some humor), the rival to gta. But i think with this game they made it different because gta5 was coming out right after it so they knew that even with their best efforts gta would just kick it's ♥♥♥, so they went a different route which i don't entirely blame them for. But it just doesn't fit in with the other games.. like where do we even go from here with a full sequel?? It ruins the SR franchise's past and also tries to bring back retro locations and references from sr 1&amp;2 when all it makes me wanna do is play those games instead. And even here all the powers and everything is soo fun that going back to the normal gameplay for the next game would seem naked. And anothe thing. Cars and guns are almost completly obsolete when you can run and fly faster than a car and use telekineses, gi mind blasts, fireballs, and more on enemies. So it feels like real chor when you have to drive or shoot in a mission. So if ur looking for guardian of the galaxy mixed with sr3 this is for you. If ur looking for a TRUE sequal to the past 3 sr games...pass.",

            "review_text": "Alright just to get this out of the way, this review comes from someone who didnt play 1 or 2. So I entered the franchise at the 3rd installment and loved the satirical nature of the game then saw this which looked like everything 3 had to offer and more so i was sold on the game out the gate but at release i was short on cash then choose GTA at the time but once i crossed over to pc this game happen to be on sale. Enough with the backstory on with the review:  So the game takes place after the events in 3, you and the saints are at a all time high point in your lives and just when when you think nothing is gonna happen yet it does. Earth is invaded by aliens who wish to conquer it and have placed you under a simulation and from there the idea is to fight your way out then find a way to gather the resources needed to retaliate.  Now the game stayed true to the satirical tone from 3 so if you were a fan of that game you'll enjoy this games humor too. Combat wise they stepped it up alot in terms of all the different ways you can fight, Vehicle wise there is couple more cars than there was in 3, environment wise its the same.  Some pros &amp; cons  Pros ~The Powers make getting around town easier and faster especially when being pursued by the authorities ~The Character customization this time around has way more options and features ~The weapons are amazing and cooky ~Co-op actually works (Decent pc port) Cons ~Once you unlock most of your basic powers it makes cars practically useless ~The Wanted system is to aggresive and will not cease pursuit until you kill the boss or use cheats unlike in 3 where you can escape if skilled enough\\ ~The mission structure becomes utterly repetative &amp; the game even makes a joke about how of a grind it is ,towards the end of the game ~I hate how some of my favorite location were destroyed (The penthouse HQ in 3) ~And lastly this is way more of a personal gripe but i couldnt stand how it was an endless night cycle through most of the game , half way through there ends up being a reverse but it was a bit annoying   My final verdict is buy it if you liked 3 but only if its on sale since there wasnt that many changes between the games  3.5 out of 5  ",

The pros: -Decent character creation and a lot of clothes to make your president super cool. -Decent plot and enjoyable characters on the ship. -It made me laugh very often and the fact that it's not a serious subject game makes it more fun to just ♥♥♥♥ around making disasters.  -A ton of quotes from other games (I think Zinyak is a parody of Brainiac). -Nothing really new in the gameplay but not even boring. -The powers are very cool and they have a lot of incredible powerups! (mostly the super-jump and the fast running). -Romance with everyone on the ship. -Naked young Shaundi in the Benjamin Mother♥♥♥♥ing King rescue quest. the cons: -the powers are cool and all but they are pretty forgettable. They aren't really original and if it wasn't for challenges you could play the game without using the active ones. -I totally hate on foot mayhems. I just find them too difficult and they are the only events that I haven't mastered with gold. -why do even vehicles upgrades exist? With the powers vehicles are completely useless and the upgrades are not even that useful, so just why? -If you put a hat on a guy with long hair he immediatly gets short haired. -I completed the game on 96% and I'm progressing very slowly becouse, I'm my opinion, there are some challenges that are really boring to achieve. -The gang buddies around the town are completely usless and I bought the upgrades just becouse I had money to spend, not becouse they actually do nothing useful. (the number of looks of the buddies tough it's cool. You want a sexy nurse? There's a sexy nurse) -This is not even a con but a question: why do tatoos remain in the real world even if you made them on the simulation? Doesn't really make any sense. -I encountered a few bugs here and there and the game crashed a couple of times but nothing massive.  So, it's not a perfect game but it's very enjoyable and it's a fun game to play for 20/30 hours if you want to do all the optional quests and take it easy doing everything. A tip: don't do by yourself all the challenges in the city like hacking and that stuff becouse you'll lose lines of dialogue in the optional quests and sometime even in the primary quests. Finish them after completing the game. It may sound slower, but trust me, it's worth it. I'll give it a 8/10 I didn't buy the dlc's so this is a review of the game without them.",

They are all fairly generic and their name sums them up, but, for me, its Super Sprint that's the issue. Saints Row is about gangs, guns and cars. However now it's about gangs, guns and super powers. You see? Volition just de-cored Saints Row and messed with the formula and still expect us to feel the same (thats like a Fallout protagonist with a voice... oh, ♥♥♥♥) Yes, there are cars and, yes, they're drivable but no super pimped car will ever beat maxed Super Sprint! Oh and (while we're at it) Super Jump has a glide ability! ♥♥♥♥ THE VTOLS! ♥♥♥♥ EVERYTHING! No more grenades (other minor skills: Telekinesis, Buff, Blast, Stomp) It's a game about gangs, guns and cars, with no need for gangs, guns or cars. The plot is a load of ♥♥♥♥♥, but the dlc is quite good  If you're a Saints fan, you probably won't like it, but if you're new you might! I recommend this gane, but only just!  TL:DR (a quote from me, 5 lines up) It's a game about gangs, guns and cars, with no need for gangs, guns or cars.",

The city loses its mystery.   Still, this game was pretty fun. Its relaxing to kick shi** out of aliens and swing around the map like spiderman. The plot is so awful that it's actually pretty good. The core game should have been much more longer because side quests are pretty much a big pile of crap.   To my opinion, first three Saints Row games were much better than this one, but if you liked the previous ones, maybe you should check this out.

Sure this series would of been better than gta with the drugs and other good features, But rockstars a company with more money. Honestly, GTA V is the WORST game out there. Its glitchy as HELL, You get killed every 24 seconds, And theres cheaters everywhere! Saints Row ofleast takes time to work there games out and test them. You all remember the port of gta iv? That failed so bad it made rockstar look like they ran out of money for the project. And they always forget about us! Next gen came out this month but pc is coming out next YEAR. Saints Row was fair to us and came out at a date. That date was same day as console launch. This game is the funnest game ever, But gta you have 12 years olds saying there screwing you mom! Then you kill them and get banned? Ofleast this game doesnt have 12 year olds! That said, Those who compare Saints Row to gta are STUPID. YOU NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL IF YOUR DOING THAT. Thats obviously why this game is better.",

I enjoyed the game as a whole, but not for the story or the missions. The super power system was really well done and it felt like there was a lot you could do by mixing up different elements with powers.  My main gripe with this game is that it just felt lazy and there was a lot to be desired. I went through the game with a feeling of 'Oh they're probably going to add more soon right?' the answer was they really didnt.  They blow their load with content within the first 10 or so hours of the game and then leave you overpowered doing more or less the same thing for the next 20. It's really fun blowing up hordes of enemies, but doing it as a 'loyalty mission' for the 25th time, it starts to lose it's flair. Every mission is a list of side diversions you have to do veiled by a flimsy reason by one of the characters to accomplish 'something' I really do say 'something' because they may as well said just that and it wouldn't have made a difference.  The story missions are about the same thing but with some sort of gimmick thrown in like a stealth section or a side scrolling beat-em-up section, to never be seen again for the rest of the game. It's really disappointing, because I really want to enjoy this game a lot more, but it seems like the developers decided to put minimum effort on an idea that could have been something awesome. The developers added more content, but that's with a grain of salt because they added in about 25% more content on top of the content from Saint's Row: The Third. So the whole thing feels like an expansion rather than a stand alone game, let alone a sequel in the Saint's Row franchise, which normally adds more depth with each new game in the series. Don't get me wrong, I really like SR4 but it fell short in the long run, it seems like one of those games you can pull up and play to kill time with a friend, but other than that I had to play it in bursts to be able to get maximum enjoyment out of it.   TL;DR: I really like SR4, but it seemed lazy and it failed to keep me interested and really fell short after it revealed all of it's content too early in the game. I would recommend picking it up on sale but don't pay full price, and absolutely don't expect anything revolutionary from this game. I'd give it a 7/10 just for the amount of time I played it and enjoyed it.",

On the mission where you driving an airship through the Zin mother ship, you come across the 'final doors' which start to close in on you. Its not that hard! Right? Well, due to a script error (Thanks so much again PC, you really helped me out), the doors close EARLY and it makes it impossible for you to get through them. I cant access all of my DLC, which the only DLC I have gotten to use so far ar maybe 1 or 2 clothes DLC and the extra cheats pack. If you dont believe me, look it up about the final door thing.

There are a few annoying and potentially game-breaking gliches, but from what I can tell they only effect lower-end computers as they are primarily loading gliches.  The controls are a little annoying, but since they can be re-mapped as you wish it isn't really that much of a problem.  The Game world is virtually identical to Saints Row III and as such you'll get really bored really quick if you played a lot of SRIII, but it does have some fun and challenging side missions that are worth the effort to complete.  The main story is alright, but I wouldn't call it top-class. It's very obviously a parody-fest of immense proportions, which admittedly is very fun.  The collectables in this game I personally devide into two groups, the first is the fifty or so 'fun' collectables that are interesting and makes the game enjoyable. The second is the thousand or so 'currency' collectables that you need to collect in order to improve an aspect of your character.  Overall, this game is worth the money you're paying for it.",

Definitely worth a buy if you enjoy these types of games like Grand Theft Auto series. It'll surprise you with how competent and thought out the game actually is both in gameplay, content and the often laugh out loud writing.   What appears to be absurd humor is often satire masked as sensationalism. Sound familar? GTA series has always provided an interesting story to go with its sandbox gaming. The game gets off to a rollicking start. You even have Aerosmith's 'I Don't Want To Miss A Thing' as your theme tune while thwarting a nuclear missle launch that you have just leapt upon and commence dismantling in-flight.   The designers consistently show time and time again that Rockstar North might enjoy rubbing your nose in s*** and making you like it. But Deep Silver are all about a drug trip gone delightfully and derisively wrong. Wonderfully, wonderfully wrong. Managing to have a solid command of my funny bone with, at times, concise and cutting humor that actually had me thinking between the slew of purile potty mouthing.",

Matrix Everything else thats not a Con  Cons:  Minor graphical issues (GTX 980 SLI) I gotta say the outfits were a little lacking imo. There were some nice ones but i was hoping for more. Crashed or Froze a few times doesn't seem to be optimized for high end PC But it ran very well most of the time and the biggest Con is it didn't last forever.

One major point I have to make about this game is the customization: I don't know if this was just me, but making a customizable main character was what made the game for me. This is mainly because as the story progressed, I continuously noticed that my own character grew with the other characters, and in turn, so did I. If I didn't have the customized character I did when I played this game for the first time, it would have been a boring and plain game. Furthermore, the well orchestrated humour of this title made me laugh more than once and there are moments that I will never forget about this game (e.g the hilarious sing-a-long). Lastly, I would also recommend playing Saints Row: The Third BEFORE Saints Row: IV, as it gives you a back-story on what happened before this title, has a lot of humour just like its follow-up and to be fair SR:TT is a fantastic game in its own right too.",

That game is awesome! If your are a fan of 3, like I was then, like me your going to get this game anyway, so for you guys its a up vote, just read on too be prepared for the disappointments of this game. This game was supposed to be DLC and you can tell, it's basically SR3 except when that mission when you where all drugged up and out of your mind, so you super speed (and lets be honest, was awesome)....well someone thought, lets make an entire DLC of that, then someone thought, no lets make it a full priced game.  So remember that you can mod your cars, well you can still do that, great right, no pointless you just run everywhere instead but ok, it’s nice that they still give you that option, right? Yeah, nowt to do with the fact that its just SR3 game, with your running and jumping code tweaked so you seem super. Well how about the story, well for the DLC I'm assuming, that it would of gone straight to the alien invasion but this is a new game, so we gotta give them abit more than that, so....erm.... lets see, they where famous celebs in the 3rd one....so lets have them running the whole country now! So you do an opening mission, which is nowhere near as good as the opening mission on the SR3 and then...bang! You’re the Prez! Just like that! Would have been so much better, actually giving you a story on how you become the President. Just think of it.... political missions, taking out the competition, planting 'interesting' items in your rivals homes, call in your friends to give you political backing, you know who I’m thinking of, some more Burt Reynolds! Etc etc etc. And then, ok so we're the Prez now, so some great missions involving blowing up other countries? No you’re like the Prez for 5 secs and then aliens attack and you’re back too doing exactly the same as SR3 because it was supposed to be just an add-on for SR3! After like 2 hours, I just couldn’t play anymore! But saying that, when my friend got the game, we started up a co-op game and it’s great, it’s all the fun of playing SR3 again! The story? Who cares?! We too busy talking to each other over the cut-scenes to care! And then with the Super Powers, its race to each new mission, super speeding down the streets, blasting things as we go! I give this a 'Thumbs Down' because in SR3, I loved it! I enjoyed playing it solo, taking my time, enjoying the story, hell I would go change outfits depending on what the mission was! This is just a frenzy co-op game, not worth full price! But sale price, especially with the extra content to give it abit more padding, its certainly an enjoyable time, if not quite the fitting end to the franchise (and by franchise I don't mean any spin off games) it should have been.",

I think Deep Silver just wanted to offset the cost of the purchase of Volition, and forced the release of this title.  Some minor improvements, but pretty much the same game: same engine, same city, same weapons, same outfits, same character models, etc.  I bought it because I'm a devout Saints Row fan as of The Third; but make no mistake, I felt screwed when I bought it, because it felt like I just bought the same game twice.  Remember how the GTA franchise used to be wacky, and fun? And then as of GTA IV they got serious, and dark? Saints Row is that alternate universe where GTA got wackier, and funner.  I still prefer The Third over this one because the story is better, and this felt rushed; but still fun.",

This was my first exposure to the brand and I must say that it was quite pleasing. There is an argument that this installment is not as good of a game as its predecessors; with this I can agree. I found Saints Row 2 and Saints Row: The Third to be more fun games, as well as more intuitive games, but in a different way than this piece. I really appreciated the satire implemented into this game that was directed both at modern standstills, as well as political matters pertaining to the United States. I was able to enjoy it so much, probably as a result of this game setting my expectations for the series, which I don't mind. I was able to greatly enjoy the two previous installments as well as some DLC that adds story based content to the game, as well as content placed sheerly for the enjoyment of the player. The game had some problems mechanically, but given the complications of my hardware, it is most likely a personal issue that most players would not experience. This game earned a 9/10 from the Fox.",

The presentation of the game is cheapish ,you've seen these graphical and physics engines and many of the art assets before, but it's directed very well. Songs and licenses are used very strategically in service of the 'Family-guy' style of referential random humor.   The story is about the antics of an impractically racially diverse urban Americana gang. It's just a vehicle for the jokes. It doesn't aspire to be an emotional drama or present it's lore seriously (although there are audio logs to find if you really are curious about Saint's Row lore).   Play this to sample and taste the gameplay systems and view the authored content. Some of the scenes are entertaining, and the game throws different systems at you constantly.

Super Powers (Dont get me wrong... Are INSANLEY fun...) but they are just way to over powered.... They completely get rid of the old like feeling of Saints Row where you will never need to drive around because you have Super Sprint that can take you there in half the time. Driving was one of SR biggest acomplishments but is now ruined because of  Super Sprint. Also, Super Powers are very OP in combat. I personally think if SR 4 had made the Super Powers avalible on certain missions  and would be all unlocked once the game is beat.  The Map ---------- Now the map is very fun and pretty itself, but that still is no excuss to the developers to not make a new map and  just recycle the old map. I will admit there are some new additions but not all that much.  Conclusion: SR4 Is a very fun game, and with 30.7 hours I have still not completed it because of the amount of missions and fun there is to do. I have recommened this game to many friends of mine and all have the same opinion.... Its amazing... I will admit I did like SR3 A bit better then this but my overall score for this game out of 100 is....  89/100 (For lack of new map and Super Powers)  Cheers! (Please rate the review!)",

            "review_text": "UPDATE 2016: My first review was done shortly after the game was released. Now that all of the dust has settled and the game has had numerous updates and DLCs and a GOTY style package with everything, I'd say it is absolutely worth the current retail price of $19.99 USD. I still think there were some valid points in my original review, so I'm going to leave it below. However, I've changed my recommendation from a No to a Yes.  BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Is this a fun game? Yes. Is this a game that is worth paying retail for? No. This game was originally supposed to be just an expansion DLC for Saint's Row: The Third. Then someone said, 'With all the work we are putting in, we should charge three times as much.' And Saint's Row IV was born. Don't get me wrong....the game is quite enjoyable and has a fair amount of content to keep you busy for a while. But it is very clear this game was not meant to be a stand-alone product, and that shows in the details (polish, bugs, etc). Then we get to the DLC....the real issue here. This company has a history of nickel &amp; diming their customers to death with tons of small DLC packs. Pay 3 dollars for new outfits. Pay 2 dollars for a new skin for your guns. Pay 7 bucks for a new set of generic missions that are no different than the already-included missions. Or my personal favorite...pay 10 bucks for a 'Season Pass' that, in any other game, would entitle you to ALL the DLC that will be released for the game. Except in this game, it doesn't do that. The name is completely misleading, and entitles you to 2 of the larger DLC packs, one of which has yet to be released. You STILL get nickel &amp; dimed for everything else. Sure, you'll discover this if you read the fine print. But it's this spirit of 'Let's milk our customers' that really leaves a bad taste in your mouth when playing games by this company. It isn't anything new, but keep in mind that they are leaving elements of this game out with the intention of getting MORE money from you at a later date. I, for one, will not be purchasing games from this company again. Consumers don't need to encourage this type of parasitic behavior.",

The comments are funny the game play although simple is still fun and the carnage makes for such a great stress releaver at the end of the day. So glad I decided to get this game, if I knew it was this entertaining I would have payed $20 bucks for it. Kinda reminds me a bit of Just Cause because of the 3rd person aspect, but driving is much easier, the gunplay works about the same and the crazy acrobatics.... sad to hear the newer game did so poorly I would have liked to pick that up as well.",

But where this game shines is it's oddities, WTF moments, Superpowers, and crude (adult) humor. As a geek with a dirty mind and and a weird sense of humor, I think this game is awesome. Admittedly, it took me a few weeks to get into it. I bought it and the DLC on sale for 6.79 or something. Played for about an hour, got frustrated, and quit. A friend told me to continue, to give it a chance, so I did. And I'm glad I did. Where else will you get the chance to force furries into giant cages with telekinesis?

I first played this game on the PS3 and just recently bought it for my laptop because I enjoyed it so much--totally not because I wanted to mod the game, hahaha--so how i would judge the game, it's very fun to play! Tons of minigames andfun gameplay, nothing more satsifying than killing aliens with a giant purple ♥♥♥♥♥ bat! Haha!  Story 4/10: Okay, okay, despite all the fun I had with this game, the plot is very generic and simple. An antagonist from another world to conquer Earth and trap thousands of people inside a simulated reality, which is pretty much a reference to 'The Matrix', a fantastic movie by the way, Anyways, the missions are mostly introducing you to the minigames and the story is very weak as a result, and doesn't have any real replay value.  Gameplay 7/10: This game is an open world environment similar to GTA--a lot of people compared this game to GTA when Saints Row 1 and 2 came out, so I'm sticking with it--with guns, laser beams, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥! Wait.. that's not right. Moving right along, yes, there are super powers in the game, another reference to 'The Matrix', which you level up by collecting 'Data Clusters' around the city of Steelport, which adds some incentive to explore the simulated city of Steelport, which I enjoyed.. despite being forced to go back to there from Saints Row the Third. So in short, if you like 'The Matrix' and love silly gameplay and super powers, then I recommend this game just for this.  Enjoyment 9/10: I enjoyed the game very much, which, yes, most of this review is a mix of my PC experience and console experience, I've had enough PC experience--somewhat--to give a review on this game. Although it was fun to do, there is ONE section of the game which was almost impossible! I had to lower my resolutiion just to get through it! It's when you escape a ship.. you'll know the one.",

The comedy elements and lovable characters make the world come alive. If you want less sci-fi and aliens, go for SR3, though. Personally, I love both games. Gat Out of Hell is also worth it if you've played this game, but I think it has less replay value. This is the best Saints Row game.",
