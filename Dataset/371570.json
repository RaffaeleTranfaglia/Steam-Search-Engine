            "review_text": "When I saw Tap Heroes being offered for sale, I was swept up in the clicker-game craze that the Summer Sale 2015 brought to Steam. Adventure Capitalist and Clicker Heroes were games that I played daily, so I decided that spending a small amount of money (I think I paid $.99) for another clicker title would be alright.  So what is it? --------------  Tap Heroes is a clicker game where you click on a monster to damage it, kill it, and get loot from it. You then use this money to upgrade yourself or your party of 3 adventurers so you can click on a monster to damage it, kill it, and get more loot from it more efficiently. Rinse and repeat ad nauseum.  The game is pretty colorful, the characters are nicely drawn, there's a decent amount of enemies to kill, and there are a ton of levels to go through with one stipulation: Once you beat level 100, the game starts over at level 101 and there's nothing new other than an increased difficulty. If you play past this point, the only thing left is to chase achievements.  Is there anything good about this game? ------------------------------------------  Yep. It's a pretty decent time waster that you can open daily do a few things, and close again without worrying too much about it. Your characters will continue to earn gold even when the game is off. You can also have the game idle in the background while you play something else if you're wanting to burn through a couple of levels in the game.   As stated before, the graphics are nice, the interface is easy to use, and because the game comes with an upfront purchase price, there's no in-game microtransaction store begging you to purchase real-money currency to help you speed through the game. Tap Heroes knows what it is, and it does it pretty well.  Is there anything bad about this game? -----------------------------------------  Yep. Once you make it past the initial first 100 levels, you've seen everything the game has to offer other than an increase in difficulty. Once you push past level 300, there're no more achievements for getting any higher unless you set a personal goal for yourself.  The music is alright to begin with, but it quickly gets old after a few levels because it's the only music track in the game.  The game is also very minimalistic compared to other clicker titles. There are no special gimmicks, no hard resets that boost your powers, just pumping money into making your heroes stronger over and over and over. It's a game that's easy to get bored with.  Let's talk about the achievements. --------------------------------------------------  The game comes with 50 of them, and you'll earn most of them over the course of just playing the game. There are a few, however, that will require a substantial amount of effort to attain, one of which I'm still working on after pumping over 200 hours into it (Kill a million monsters). To 100% this game in any reasonable amount of time, you're going to have to simply leave the game running in the background night and day for weeks. You'll also probably want to get a free auto-clicker program at some point. Another achievement, Click 250,000 times, is going to kill your mouse, your wrist, or both.  Despite a couple of ridiculous achievements, getting most of the achievements will give you a sense of 'Hey, I've completed this game and squeezed every bit of substance I can out of it', which is what any set of achievements should set out to do.  So, overall, do I recommend Tap Heroes? -------------------------------------------  For the most part, I'd say yes, but only if you're going to pick it up when it's discounted. It's fun for a time, and I've definitely gotten more out of it than the initial dollar I spent on it, but it'll quickly wear on you if you try to play it for extended periods of time. It's simple and minimalistic, and that's probably a good thing for some, but I know myself and others who have had experience with other clicker titles were left wanting a little more variety and options. At this point, I'm only playing the game to 100% it and then I'll probably never open the application again.  I wish I could choose something in-between the yes and no recommendations, because that's where the game falls. It's not great, but it's not terrible either.",

I recommend to level up the attack and the speed of the warrior and idle at level 75 [ 1 sec= 1 kill = 150 - 177 gold]    And now about the game:  For 2.99€ you will get a very simple Clicker game without much content after level 200. It is nothing special just average game you play for 100% achievments. There are a few upgrades you can buy and hard endbosses at the end of every area. If you want to buy this game wait for a price drop in a sale.",

I just love the puppet-show type of arts and it is also simpler than the other 2, simply because it doesn't requires you to pay too much attention to it, unlike AdVenture Capitalist and Clicker Heroes, where both of them requires you to resets your 'current income' to 0 in order to get a slightly better 'income', which then requires your attention often as you need to relevel up the beginning 'incomes' so you can reach where you were before the reset.. I'm too lazy for that...",

Maybe you're wondering why paid for a clicker game when you can play other clicker game for FREE? Well, this game got no 'in-app purchase' like the other clicker games and on top of that you can get FREE Steam Trading Cards.  So yeah, this game got it's own charm. ",

            "review_text": "Honestly, I find the clicker games tons of fun. I play all three that are currently available on Steam. This one is different in that you have three heroes. A tank (warrior), a healer (mage) and dps (rogue). This seems like a nice, familiar setup for me as a WoW player.  I find the visuals and animations appealing as well as the sounds but because I need to leave it running in the background to farm coins, I play in Windowed mode with the sound off. Although I'm not normally a fan of the kazoo, I laughed when I got past the first world and one played a very short tune.  As others have mentioned, I would like for there to be a way to earn gems. This is possible on my Android by going into the add gem icon and selecting 'Watch a video and earn a gem' but not on my Steam version.  The only other thing I can think of that bothers me about the game is how, as of this review, Poison is spelled Poision in the header of the Rogue potency drop down. An easy fix for the developer, I'm sure.",

            "review_text": "Good game, great addition to anyone who likes any of the other idle games out there. Fairly unique for being an idle game.   There are some issues with some parts. For starters the gold counter is capped at 999,999. You can get more gold than this but it stops counting after 999,999. the upgrade costs stop counting after 99,999 but i dont know if it actually charges more than 99k.  As for progression there are 2 currencies, I dont think either are purchasable but gems are vital to progression, but their drops are really scarce. Another issue, I dont know if intended, you dont gain anywhere close to the same gold if the app is closed. What youd normally get in 5 minutes will take you hours if the app isnt open. Chests also dont seem to spawn unless the app is both open and in focus, you cant just leave it in the backround forcing you to stare at an idle game to make progress.   If you have no issues with having to keep the game open in order to advance then Id give it a look.",

There are several other clicker games you can play for free which as equally as redundant.

You have 3 heroes, a Warrior which mostly deals damage and critical hits, a Mage which heals your party and a Ranger which stuns and poison the monsters. You also have your own 'Hero' that can heal your party, deal damage, critical heal/critical hit and cast abilities!  The backgrounds are well-made and they are animated. There's a different music played for boss stages and i'm pretty sure there's an infinite amount of levels. If you happen to die, you lose a bunch of gold but you keep all your heroes and stats, so no biggie!  I love the new features that were missing from other idle games and I say this one has it's spot on the Steam Store. It is also very affoardable, so, I think this game is worth trying out if you are into the Idle genre.",
