I'd call it medium difficulty -- usually the solution becomes obvious within a few minutes, although 'executing' it could take a few (... dozen ...) tries. I've never gotten completely stuck so far (currently on the 4th area or so) so the game only occasionally gets frustrating if you're just playing through and not focusing on the time/death challenges -- although I always try to do the Jeff challenge.",

My favorite part is feeding the fuzzy monster, and in fact didnt realize until much later that you can just toss him a dead body and he will eat it!! This game however needs further content, and some of the puzzles are a bit easy. I hit the developer up on Reddit and asked if we could get a tool to create our own puzzles, but unfortunately that is not going to be likely because of the development path they chose, but man what a perfect platform to release user maps or whatever. All in all, good fun game, and its good for a nice casual play session.",

            "review_text": "I bought this because it was cheap and looked like a good game for when I'm in the mood to play something more casual. I was surprised by how fun this game got with each new level and each new mechanic. The gameplay is very addictive and simple yet tons of fun and thoughtful.The pacing is great as each level offers carefully constructed puzzles that feel fresh rather then copied or repeated. As you get used to encountering a trap or puzzle mechanic the game adds new layers to keep you thinking!  l*] The game is plain fun. Not a single complaint about it. The gameplay is solid and feels rewarding as you solve silly puzzles by sacrificing your oddly named loyal knights.     The audio is pleasant, no annoying soundtrack or repetitive horrible sound effects that drive you insane.     The visual style and graphics suit the game completely and are quite delightful.      Appeals to casual gamers as well as those looking for a challenge as each level can be replayed with several objectives to try and accomplish including finding secrets, beating a level with the fewest 'lives' sacrificed and speed running. Completing all challenges for each level and earning the highest score/award can be quite challenging even for a hardcore gamer- but these objectives are all optional and are NOT required to continue to the next level.      The length of the game so far is quite a bit more then I originally expected. After 3 hours I don't think I'm even at the half way point yet- I might be nowhere near it!     In my 3 hours I've expirienced no stutter, long loading times, bugs, glitches or any annoyances. The game has run quickly and smoothly throughout, and I'm playing it at it's highest settings on a fairly cheap laptop that can't run AAA games.  I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a game that can be played in short bursts or longer sessions, anyone looking for something non-serious and affordable.  ",

Definitely is replayable because there are achievements for getting the levels done fast, with few deaths and/or getting eaten by an adorable critter on every level. Even the credits are themselves a level with achievements. Seriously well-crafted game.",

The game gets harder the further you come, and there are multiple solutions, hidden stuff and shortcuts everyhwere and you get rewarded for being smart and thoughtfull. The humor in the game is actually quite minimal and most of it only there at the very end. Also it has a pretty good soundtrack, which sometimes reminded me to Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze, some songs are just epic. Beating levels as fast as you can or with less deaths are good replay values.",

That mechanic is that when you die, your body lingers around, and it is used to do things like act as a stepladder, let you climb where there are spikes, and hold down buttons for you. Sometimes I find that I can get a bit frustrated with the puzzles, but I found out that if you just leave it for ten minutes or so and come back to it, that usually solves the problem. This game is a fun, casual pickup I would certainly reccomend.",
