            "review_text": "The Hidden World continues the story of Miranda Calomy and her clockwork-friend, Sprocket. Like its predecessor, the basic goal is to search a series of beautifully drawn scenes to find a bunch of hidden objects. However, the sequel increases the scope of the original, both in length and gameplay. Where the first game lasted maybe 2-3 hours, this one seemed a bit longer (maybe around 3-4 hours, depending on how slowly you take things). The interface and quality of the puzzles have also improved as well. This time, the puzzles are much more involved, and actually require some real thought at times! Amazing, I know. It's a nice improvement. However, with that change, one positive trait of the first game is now lost - the sequel is no longer kid friendly. Thinking back on it, there are probably a couple of puzzles in here that younger kids wouldn't be able to solve on their own (one involving classic works of literature springs to mind), and most of the puzzles are at least a bit more difficult overall. So, while the hidden-object scenes are still great for kids, they might need help with some of the puzzles that connect them. If you enjoy hidden-object games and are looking to fill a few hours with (mostly) mindless, casual fun, you'll probably like this. Again, my only issue against recommending this fully (assuming you like the genre), would be the price. I feel like it's on the higher end for what you get, even considering the potentially 'endless' replay of randomized scenes. So, just take that into consideration when considering a purchase, or maybe wait for a sale. Otherwise, as with the first game, if you don't care for mindless hidden-picture games or puzzles, move along, there's nothing to see here.",
