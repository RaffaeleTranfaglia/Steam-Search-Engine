This game is something you should seriously pick up.   If you don't want to take notes/screenshots/etc though? You should probably look for another game. For the most part, all of the puzzles are pretty fair, but there are a few that kinda made me go '...really?'  If you're looking for a good challenge, I can not recommend this game enough. My only regret is that I didn't hear about it soon enough to get in on the kickstarter for the sequel they're working on.  That said, I admit to getting frustrated at the very end and succumbed to having a friend give me a few tips xD After 90 hours I was just ready to be done, ya know? It was kinda frustrating, but as a whole, I still love the hell outta this game &lt;3",

            "review_text": "La-Mulana is brutal. It will do nothing to help you if you are stuck; everything you need is in the game in the form of tablets marked with obscure riddles or prose that you either need to find or need to decipher in the same manner as an actual archaeologist would.  A great example is how I played the game for about 10 hours on my first playthrough without having found the warping item (which is in the very first area) that's absolutely necessary for decent progress. The game didn't stop my progress and inform me that I was missing something. In fact, aside from one dead end, I could have stumbled through the whole game without this warping item (and I'm fairly certain that with planning you could even circumvent this).  Even in the midst of those 10 grueling hours (where I had to grind on enemies to heal instead of warping to the hot springs which heal you fully), I still felt La-Mulana was something very special, and that feeling greatly intensified when I started a fresh second playthrough and went further into the game. I think it might actually be my absolute favorite 2D adventure game, and I say that as a very encompassing statement (including all your Zelda's, Metroid's, etc.).  It made me think more than even any cut-and-dry puzzle game I've ever played has made me think. I couldn't solve all the puzzles on my own- I will readily admit that. It doesn't do anything to diminish my opinion of the game- everything you need to solve anything is available if you have the brain and willpower to figure it out. Some of it is incredibly obscure and difficult to figure out, but I'd imagine if you asked an actual archaeologist how hard his job is, they'd say it's a lot harder than La-Mulana (maybe this is actually a sim game?)  Add a layer of amazing combat and action on top of that, with lots of huge boss battles, and it's what I'd consider perfection. People criticize the jumping mechanic. That would be like criticizing the jumping in Castlevania; it's a short-sighted complaint, because the game is 100% built around the limited control. Everything in La-Mulana is hand-crafted beauty, please buy this.",

            "review_text": "'Obtuse' is a word that another reviewer used to describe this one, and it could very well be a one-word review. Anyhow...  La-Mulana is a beautifully made game (esp. environment art, music, boss design) and has a lot of fun aspects, but in my opinion it ultimately falls victim to its own sense of smugness. I actually didn't mind the control scheme, which is essentially a modified version of Castlevania's, with weapon-specific timing, pushback when getting hit, and unalterable directional jumping (except when descending from a standstill jump). It's pretty easy to get used to if you've played enough games of that era.  I also don't mind many of the 'puzzles' (which I think could be more accurately described as riddles). What ended up nudging me toward not recommend the game was the implementation of the riddles. After about the third or fourth areas, you start finding heaps of increasingly cryptic clues that won't be introduced for nearly another whole half of the game and often refer to far-off places (also true for many diases and events which trigger distant environment changes that you subsequently have to hunt for). This is the main design element that necessitates the tedious manual note-taking that the developer gleefully encourages. It also has the effect of (rather artifically) increasing the game's perceived difficulty. To me, this didn't really have the seemingly intended effect of inspiring the required devotion of time and manual energy to figure out most of the game on my own, but instead kinda transformed the experience into what increasingly felt like a menial task. Very glad that there are a variety of guides to reduce the tedium, otherwise my patience would have worn off long before finishing the game.  Glad I got it on a good sale. For now, I'm having more fun just challenging the bosses in the time attack mode.",

            "review_text": "La Mulana is a fabulous game. I wouldn't say that it's for everyone, but it was well worth my time. Before you start playing, I would recommend reading the manual or   watching their tutorial video  before playing. There's a few things that frustrate new players that they cover.  La Mulana expects you to bring a notepad along, but there is a shortcut--you can take screenshots, and look them over when you are trying to figure something out. Once you've left the first area, there are very few tablets that are not referring to some puzzle somewhere. Even the lore tablets usually come with something relating to a clue.  If you ever find yourself stuck on something, or wondering if you need something, and don't have any friends to ask for minimal spoilers, I cannot recommend using  Cheshire's Hint Based Guide to La-Mulana  enough. Unlike resorting to the wiki, where you are practically guaranteed to have the puzzle solved for you, without explanation  why  that's the solution, Cheshire put in a lot of work to make the guide have hints, with multiple levels of spoilers, including a text dump from the relevant tablets (if they aren't near by), until actually telling you what must be done after a few spoiler tags.",

            "review_text": "This is on my top... 3 games of all time. It's definitely not for everyone. Its a great action platformer, and a great puzzler, but the combination of the two is what makes it genius. If difficult, often-bizzare puzzles are not for you, the game stands on it's own as an action platformer, as you can just look up the solutions to the puzzles (this should be avoided though, if possible - the puzzles are part of the greatness).  The music is gorgeous. The artwork is gorgeous (particularly minibosses/bosses). Animation is great. Writing is great - game is both very dark, yet full of humor.   This game is literally worth $200. $15 is a steal. If you enjoy platformers, and don't mind putting on your thinking cap (and bringing along a pen and paper to take notes!), you should stop reading this and just buy it, you won't regret it.  There are not many games of this genre that truly last 30-50 hours. I cannot think of one. The value is immense.   Edit: So 9 months later - oh my god. La-Mulana. The greatest. Still, I wanted to touch on something that I briefly mentioned in my initial review, but didn't elaborate enough into.[/b]   When it comes to La-Mulana, you either 'get it' or you don't. Now don't get me wrong - it's got nothing to do with how 'sophisticated' one's tastes are or anything like that. Those arguments are always meaningless. Rather, La-Mulana is a flawed game in many aspects.  I know plenty of people who don't dig the game, and they can usually list off a bunch of minor (but valid) gripes. Sometimes, someone might even have a major criticism regarding the design of the game. I'll be honest - I end up discounting those opinions of just not 'getting it', since they're usually related to the fundamental design of the game ('It's like, too big and confusing, and they don't give any direction').  While I'm not a fan of those crticisms, I absolutely can acknowledge others. It is true - the game is not for everyone, like I said at the start. You might not like it for perfectly valid reasons. Now if you do like it? You will love it. It'll literally blow your mind, like it blew mine.   It seems to me that most people either play 4 hours or less of La-Mulana, or they play 30+ hours. Again - you 'get it' or you don't. Movies and other forms of media can be the exact same way - some people will walk out of a film that others will watch hundreds of times. On top of that, this is a  cult classic  we're dealing with. Expect most fans who love it to rave about it, and nearly everyone else to not understand what all the fuss is about.   As far as raving goes, here's mine:   Think - have you ever loved something so much that you're almost frustrated that more people don't understand how incredible it is? Movies, books, songs, games... you name it - I'm sure there's something that you feel that way about. That's how I feel about La-Mulana. To me, it is the most incredible, genius, outstanding, 'best game of all time' contending game I've played in years.   I implore everyone to at least check this out (ideally when it's on sale for like $3, even though I think it's worth $200), see if it's for you. Most people probably won't be into it. They won't  dislike  the game - they'll just be indifferent. 'Eh, it's good, but I don't see why it's the greatest game of all time and could possibly be the messiah in gaming form.' Perfectly understandible - but if you  are  among us few who's brains are for some reason wired to adore this twisted monster of a game, it might literally change your life.",

            "review_text": "Edit: To those who disagree, please comment. I honestly want to hear how I'm wrong about this.  La-Mulana is a fantastic platforming adventure game that does not hold your hand. 'The adventure begins' and that's all you get. The video on the Steam store page helps quite a bit, giving you the basic essentials to starting. From there, you spelunk a massive ruin with many cultures mixed into a great, nuanced, satisfying story.  I really want to just say that I love this game, everyone should play it and learn how to be a real gamer. However, there were some frustrating points that ultimately made me drop it. That's not to say that everyone will find the same things frustrating, but I wanted to give fair warning at least.  La-Mulana has a very well designed difficulty curve for quite a while, but right around the mid-game, things get very overwhelming. A number of puzzles at that point have given you so many clues and you have so many places you can go that it becomes impossible to filter between what you can and can't solve without meticulous note-taking. I found the sheer number of things that you have to keep handy just in case a tablet somewhere hints at a room somewhere else to go beyond intimidating to the point of not being fun.  A lot of things are hidden behind one completely unremarkable wall among hundreds or trial and error. At the same time I've had the most legitimate challenge that I've had in any game. I wish I could give this a neutral to say 'be prepared for masochistic gaming or a walkthrough', but this is probably the closest I can get considering the majority of people. Also, my playtime is not what it appears, I've been playing collaboratively in offline mode with a friend.",

La Mulana is one of the few games which could be considered a work of art - that is, we aren't just talking about story and graphics here like many games lauded as art are praised for - the entirety of this piece of work is a masterwork of the craft of game design.   Gameplay will challenge and push players to their limits, and encourage discussion among peers to discover it's many secrets. Graphics and story are basic yet without any glaring flaws. Music is catchy, and captures the mood of every location and event perfectly.  Controls may seem stiff at first, but the even a casual player will be able to get used to them, especially since the levels are designed around them. Some puzzles may be too tough to solve solo, and while taking notes down old school style is encouraged, some may be discouraged by the lack of taking in-game notes (bar the ability to log down a number of clues). However, none of these minor setbacks add up nor will bog a player down for long.  All explorers, Metroidvania fans, and fans of 'hard' games will surely enjoy this remake of the classic indie.",

I was hoping to find a game with fun and engaging puzzles and that is pretty much what i got in the first 10 hours or so. But eventually you will get to a point where it is literally impossible to solve some of the puzzles without looking stuff up on the internet. I have 38 hours played, so i was probably stuck for 20+ hours trying to find a way to continue but what i had to do to progress was 'stand in random spots and press the item button', sure you could argue that there were stone tablets that gave me hints how to get into 'eden' but what about the gate of illusion teleport puzzles, or the location of the book of dead, or the fact that a random gate appears on the surface after killing a random boss.   After getting through eden/the gate of illusion with a guide i decided that i'm done with this game and i won't finish it. The gameplay isn't very enjoyable, the bosses in the early game are all easy (despite me accidently playing on hardmode) and the bosses in the mid-lategame can almost all be cheesed with the lamp.  I eventually watched a video of a speedrun for this game and in the later parts you have to do a lot more random stuff for example in the tower of godess and in the shrine of the mother. One of the puzzles is stand 45 seconds in a room for the doll to change, another is randomly look at the upgraded map at a specific location in the shrine of the mother and i don't even want to talk about the final puzzle.  I don't mind hard games, i don't mind difficult puzzles but this game has too much random stuff without reasonable hints. I wouldn't have complained about cryptic puzzles for bonus items and whatnot, but a lot of the unreasonable puzzles are required to progress and finish the game.",

It presents you with a large labyrinth of ancient mystery, that is ripe with danger, mystery, and treasures. There is this nice old school charm to it, with a new age hardcore feel to spelunking.

The soundtrack and sound effects are very pleasant to the ears. The graphic style is pleasant to the eyes, and reminds me of Castlevania games on the gameboy. I love when a game doesn't hurt your eyes after playing it too much, compared to some other games I own. If you enjoy old school fun, grab this game.    I picked mine up for $1.50 on a flash sale(which is a steal if I've ever seen one), when it's on sale it's typically $3.74, and when it's not it's only $15. $15 might seem like a lot for a remastered version of a game from 2005. Honestly, this rates up there with cavestory. It's great. Seriously. Buy this.    Alright, now that I'm done talking about what's great...let me be honest. The jumping takes you back to the older castlevania days. Do you remember how in mid air you couldn't move? Well, this game lets you move...but it has sort of a delay. Jumping in this game is more old school than anything, which can be annoying. This game, similar to castlevania, also has a lot of knockback once you are hit. This usually isn't too annoying, but in the Spring(water) level, you can easily get knockbacked by a fish over and over trying to traverse the elevators. The game...at first will also confuse you. I recommend trying to solve as many puzzles as you can in the gate area of La Mulana, as it will grant you the most useful item in the game.   Besides slight annoyances which you get used to, this game is a solid 9/10.",

            "review_text": "La-Mulana is quite possibly one of - if not the - best Metroidvania title ever created. Unlike others in the genre, the game's open-ended exploration is genuinely nonlinear in progression, and up until the very end of the game there will always be more treasures to discover, new areas to explore, puzzles to solve, and bosses to beat, at your own pace. It's challenging, but fair - you'll not only need good platforming and action skills, but also an extremely perceptive eye and a sharp mind in order to find the secrets and solve the incredible number of puzzles in the ruin. It's also capped off with incredibly detailed lore and a hand-drawn world full of detail, and accompanied by some incredibly memorable music.  The end result is a game that leaves you feeling like all of your progress is specifically your progress - your achievement, your success. Every little step, every puzzle you manage to solve and new area you explore, feels like a victory, from beginning to end.",

La-Mulana is an experience, a real adventure that, just like life, has no objections about throwing you straight in at the deep end and not giving a ♥♥♥♥ whether you sink or swim. It's tough, it's long (my first playthrough took about 40 hours) and BOY will it make you curse, but the environments are so varied and cleverly crafted and the soundtrack kicks so much ♥♥♥ that the time it'll take to find your feet feels more like a privilege than a chore. There are mysteries within mysteries within mysteries and more unique boss and sub-boss battles than I have it in me to remember; not a single part of this incredibly large game feels the same as any other and the more of it you explore, the more you WANT to explore.  I could wax lyrical about La-Mulana for literally hours on end, but there are already videos and Let's Plays abound which do just that, so I won't bore you any further. My basic opinion is this - despite the difficulty (or perhaps in part because of it), La-Mulana is without a shadow of a doubt the best action platformer I've ever played in my life. EVER. As much as the term's overused nowadays, it's a masterpiece. If you love your adventures and aren't afraid of a challenge, you absolutely MUST give it a go. I swear, you won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "I've played the original version of this game, even if I am only about 2 hours into this visual update to the original. You can find the original online if you do some sleuthing, but many might be turned off by the low graphics of the original game.   This game is great! This game makes you feel like a real explorer. If you're not using some guide to help you through the game, you're almost certainly going to take notes. dozens of puzzles litter the ruins of La-Mulana, and you might find a hint to a puzzle on the other side of the ruins on some stone. Even then, it might take some research or just a sharp mind (not to mention some good platforming skills) to solve some of the puzzles.   The game plays like a castlevania or metroid game, but the sheer amount of puzzle solving here brings the game up a notch.   The music in this game is AMAZING. The original had great old style music (something akin to 8-bit/16-bit era style music). This remake has vastly improved music, but of course that depends on your preference. Every area feels unique thanks to its music. I bought the OST to this game because the music is just that good.  Visually, it's an obvious upgrade. The coins plink on the ground, and the moving parts of the ruins push dust and dirt into the air when they first move, giving a realistic feel to the game. One thing to note is that some visuals that need to be seen for puzzles are either easier to see or harder to see than the original. It all depends on how that screen was layed out. What I mean is that a part of the background that might have stood out in the original (due to it basically being the only thing there) might blend in more with the full backgrounds. Likewise, the added detail can make it more apparent what you are dealing with in the room.   For those that played the original, the difficulty is largely unchanged, though practically all of the once forever missable items can have their puzzles reset, which is nice.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes Metroidvania style games if you're up for a challenge, and I believe that even if you've played the original La-Mulana, you should drop a bit of cash and play through this one too.  Edit: I've played through this version by now, and this version is just as great as the original. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge",

Pulling a lever you just found makes something rumble in the distance, several skeleton-filled screens away, but it’s up to you to notice what’s changed.   The game gives precious few clues on how to deal with certain things, like bosses you can’t damage until you have the right item, or fiendish puzzles that punish incorrect solutions with death. It’s the type of game that wants you to draw your own maps, make notes, and have fun exploring the well-crafted universe within. If you don’t ruin it for yourself by looking up guides online, the experience is incredibly rewarding.  The developer’s own genre for La-Mulana is “Ruins Exploration Archaeological Action Game”, made in homage to old MSX games like Maze of Galious (1987). It’s just you, your trusty whip, and whatever wit you bring, versus a sprawling interconnected tomb full of mystery. The Steam version is based on the freeware game released a few years back, but remade from the ground up with various gameplay and visual improvements. Proper gamepad support has been added, along with achievements, a new area, and additional modes like Time Attack.",

A lot of the gadgets you get are hidden, so finding them feels very rewarding. 4. Everything about the artwork was done to perfection. 5. The bad guys are unique and each has its own way of attacking. 7. The music is well done and catchy. 8. It was clearly a well thought out game with much effort put into it. 9. Bosses and mini bosses are difficult but fun.  Cons:  1. Some of the riddles are simply too difficult. The majority of players will likely use a guide eventually. 2. Under-water/lava controls are difficult and more than frustrating at times. 3. Dying can be a real pain in the ♥♥♥ if you havent found a save point in the area you are in. 4.

That's literally the gist of this game, hitting every wall and scanning everything just so you can progress a slight bit.

There's a lot of comparisons to Dark Souls with this game, but I think it's more like Demon's Souls: an unrefined prelude to a great game. Similar to Demon's Souls, La Mulana is challenging but it's mostly challenging because of bad design. Also similar to Demon's Souls, fans of this game rave about it because they feel like they need to play sadistic, quasi-impossible games to prove that they're not 'casuals.'

First of all, the jumping. It's like if you took castlevania jumping, where you can't control your descent, and tried to fix it but stopped halfway through, Point is it feels weird.  A bigger issue is the level design and enemy placement. This game opts to have single screens with a scroll kind of like zelda but with gravity. This can be done well, but here the enemies and obstacles are placed in a way that it's extremely likely for the player to get hit by something they can't see coming, and if they do see it as the screen scrolls they can't react because of the poor to nonexistant mid-air controls. And there are some places where if you jump off the side of the screen, the next screen has no floor and you'll fall. It requires so much caution that it ruins the point of playing a video game.  Another small issue is that you can't grab onto ladders while jumping. It's small, but it goes against my instinct and really should have been fixed seeing how many ladders there are.  The platforming is a hassle, partially due to the jumping but also because the platforms are often placed badly. The jumping and the way the platforms are placed remind me of Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest. And the main character has a whip. It's almost like the developers looked at that game as inspiration.

Its hard. Not Dark Souls hard; not challenging in a way that drives you to want to win, to want to beat the next boss and the next and eventually the game. Its frustratingly hard. Unfun hard. This becomes ESPECIALLY apparent in alot of the boss fights. First of all, give the arenas a little bit of thought! The second boss' arena is two platfroms and a ladder. The first? A series of floating platforms placed above of each other. The third? A minecart run over tracks of varying heights against a boss who you can only damage by hitting his head. First three bosses weak points are all the head. Also, this game, particularly in the boss fights, has some of the worst hitboxes I have seen in a videogame. We're talking Dark Souls 2 bad.    The game itself doesn't even know what its doing half the time. For example, sometimes the fireballs on the third boss will do 8 damage, other times 12? Sometimes you'll get hit by his charge, other times the exact same thing wil happen, the exact same attack, the exact same point of contact between the PC and the boss, and nothing will happen.

For some reason though, La-Mulana isn't ruined when you purchase it.  The gameplay is like strangling a sock with a hot dog. You start out with a small bar of health that increases as you collect these items called Sacred Orbs. I'd have low health too if I didn't have my orbs. As you progress through the various traps and transexuals of La-Mulana, you're obviously going to be taking damage. The only way to heal is to eat these snot bubbles that enemies drop, or to give a load off in the hot springs.  You could say that the level design is pretty PUZZLING. Picture Ghouls n Ghosts and throw all of its hundreds of puzzles into a bag, and put La-Mulana's puzzles into a bag and all of a sudden they become  Perhaps the greatest feature is your character's progression. You can really feel your chips begin to sog when you're wailing on bosses you had trouble with before but you can't fight bosses you've already killed you idiot.

Here was a Metroidvania in the strictest sense of the word, with an expansive hand-crafted map just waiting to be explored. Pivotal items could be found anywhere, so you were constantly rewarded for investigating every nook and cranny. These upgrades also allowed you to intuitively access new areas--for example,   once you acquire an item that lets you breathe underwater, you can progress further in a watery area.    At this point, my only complaints were that save points are few and far between, and are often not located anywhere near bosses.  As I progressed through the game, I grew more and more frustrated. Upgrades stopped being intuitive since the obstacles they got past became too obviously artificial. For example,   some items interact with arbitrary symbols found throughout the ruins, which you had no reason to believe were important at all.   This leads to a lot of directionless backtracking.  Eventually, I got stuck, looked at a guide, and was shocked at the number of required items that were hidden in unfairly obscure locations. Stuff like 'once you do X, a ceiling in an unrelated area that you've already explored becomes breakable with your whip'. Maybe a tablet somewhere contains a subtle hint that would point you in the right direction, but I feel this level of opaqueness is bad game design. Super Metroid had plenty of hidden secrets, but there was almost always something unusual about the area to prompt you to scan it more closely with your X-Ray Scope.  I'm unsure whether I will continue playing La-Mulana, but if I do, I expect to have to rely on a guide. Despite this, I do see why the game was so influential, and I still think it has quite a lot to offer.",

            "review_text": "La-Mulana is a 2d exploration-based platformer, a metroidvania, if you will. You run around a vast interconnected complex of ruins, whipping snakes and skeletons and bats and whatnot, solving puzzles, jumping, falling on spikes, etc. There are many little treasures to collect, powering up your character in some small way, often in such a way that is only really necessary for accessing a single area of the labyrinth, but giving you an actual ability rather than just throwing a key in your hand is a nice touch. The puzzles are many and quite esoteric, which I appreciate, though a few too many of them simply force you to return with some gadget, that more than likely required some other thing to solve its own puzzle. It definitely walks the line between intellectually engaging and tedious. The music is good. Overall the game has a lot of personality, doing things that seem a bit absurd from a design standpoint, but ultimately contributing to that intimate, programmed in somebody's mom's basement kind of feel that make Indie games the joy they are. Or can be, anyway. Where the game falls flat on its face is combat. Wonky collision, tedious enemies, needlessly frustrating bosses, pointless sub weapons, unresponsive controls, obnoxious healing mechanics, it's difficult to name something that was done right in terms of the combat design. The combat and platforming draw heavily, if not entirely, from NES era Castlevania. The whip has a little delay on it, your jump arc can't be altered (much) after you've left the ground, getting hit sends you flyiing, there are subweapons that, hypothetically at least, can fill in the gaps in your offensive capabillities. And that may have worked, if the level and enemy design had been borrowed from NES Catlevania as well. Instead, You find yourself navigating post-Symphony of the Night levels and enemies with pre-Symphony of the Night controls. Enemies move around a lot and in fairly random patterns, hitting them without getting hit yourself is a bit of a gamble (there's a very good reason fleamen only took one hit in Castlevania). You'll routinely find yourself knowcked off platforms and faced with a lengthy trek to return simply because a bat decided to move a certain way at a certain time. Many enemies are simply a matter of sitting and waiting for them to turn their back so you can hit them wothout risking your life (waiting is not skill). The subweapons are slow, weak, and generally go in a straight line, which begs the question of why there are even so many. It uses a bizarre healing mechanic. Enemies drop little health balls, but instead of restoring your health, they fill a bar underneath your health and then, once that bar is filled , all your health. This virtually guarantees that your health will be restored at some arbitrary moment, rather than when you would could actually benefit. Why the balls don't just restore your health directly is beyond me. The system can only be described as asinine. All of this would be tolerable, but what truly sinks the ship are the disastrous boss battles. Don't get me wrong, graphically the bosses are very impressive. Detailed, well animated, room-filling sprites certainly have an appeal about them. But the problem is that a massive room filling monstrosity has to be able to fight the player in such a way that justifies that level of detail. When, for all the charging and fire breath and crumbly cieling bits, the main threat, the biggest factor driving the difficulty of the fight, is not anything the boss is actually doing, but the difficulty inherent in negotiating the tiny area from which you can hit the boss without getting hit yourself, all that detail becomes a bit pointless. For a boss to attack the player in however many unique and interesting ways, but ultimately kill them because the player touched its chin a few too many times shows very bad combat design. I'm going to go farther and say that the concept of the player being hurt by touching enemies is an archaic anachronism and should be done away with. But whatever. Yeah, the game is hard. Hard in a very Dark Souls kind of way, where it's not really so much that you need to get good at it, but that you need to remember stuff and proceed slowly and not break your controller and all that noise. It's punishing and clunky and sort of poorly designed on purpose to make it more difficult. Sometimes that can be nice. I recommend it despite it's flaws. I dunno, play it or don't. It's unique, I respect that.",

It is a puzzle based game mostly, and not the usual kind of puzzle either, the basis is usually to obtain a very hard to understand hint then apply it to a part of the ruins. For example, you begin the game with an inability to look at written text, so you have to figure out how to spend the money you have. You are expected to look at all the shop’s wares in the village and then purchase a portable scanner for your laptop. Another portion of this games puzzles is looking for places to apply game mechanics. Many times, a suspicious looking block can be broken to reveal treasure, or pushed out of the way, or can be walked through. Attacking certain things will be punished in the ruins though, so one should always be cautious. Many people also have a problem with the way the controls are: the keyboard control scheme may take some getting used to because the menu, pause, and movement keys can not be rebound (in other words- If you like WASD, too bad). Some have a bigger problem with the way the character moves-If you run then jump you will continue to in the direction you were going in a semi-adjustable arc, and if you walk off of a precipice will fall directly down. The only way to have control in mid air is to jump while standing still. You will then have control on the way down.  the bosses are hard. So hard that unless you have certain items you will fail endlessly (or be very lucky, or spend a total of twenty-seven minutes between each attack you make dodging). you would have a easier time Beating Final Fantasy XII Blind on a low level You, see, LA-MULANA is like an avocado, it is a rich oily superfood, unique among most other fruits, but also has a taste that many find off-putting, or love.

There is so much to discover and unfold in the game, part of the fun is finding out how to obtain a new treasure or find a new area to explore. The platforming physics are a bit wonky at first, and can mess up the gaming logic in your head, but it feels fair as you learn how to adapt to it (For example : In-game, if you jump moving right, you can only move right, but if you jump up without moving left or right, you can control your jump more. Also, touching a wall while jumping in a direction can give you back your aerodynamic control).  The main challenge of the game is solving these huge riddles that can really stump you if you don't have a guide, and at times, you might need to look at every aspect of details, or every word the game conveys, just because it can be very vital for solving these challenging puzzles. Aside from the riddles, the game isn't that difficult until you start reaching certain areas (especially in the early-game), or fight bosses (then again, if you're as skilled in video games as I am, hard mode isn't as hard as it seems, despite the extra deaths (which is all apart of the fun in a game)).

The soundtrack is amazing, the satisfaction of solving a overly arching riddle is trumendous, and the bosses are quite challenging to fight. I highly recommend this game to the few that won't give up.   (Also, if you're not sure about this game, there is a free version available looming around the internet with older graphics and slightly more frustrating moments, and equally great soundtrack. Just remember to patch the english translations, otherwise you'll get stumped quite easily)(Another thing I'd like to mention is that the official guide for this game is actually super useful!)",

            "review_text": "La-Mulana does not give even the tiniest crap about you, and it's all the better for it. It wisely understands that playing as an action-archaeologist exploring mysterious ruins means hurtling into a confusing unknown, and everything about its play reinforces that. It's fantastically sprawling, fantastically confusing, and fantastically frustrating, but if you enjoy a taste of those elements, this could be the perfect game for you.  It's closest cousin is probably Super Metroid, but La-Mulana trades out the former's tight action gameplay for much, much,  much  more focus on puzzles and look-before-you-leap lethality. And not just block-pushing shenanigans. (Though there's no shortage of that, of course.) La-Mulana demands that you approach your adventure like an actual archaeologist. You'll need to pay attention to details, take diligent notes, understand the history of the ruins, and never, ever, stop looking for new nooks and crannies to explore. Metroidvania-style games often feature an element of sequence-breaking, allowing diligent/skilled players to tackle the game in unusual orders. La-Mulana stands alone in being so massive and so uninterested in shepherding you along a default path that it's hard to say if there's a 'proper' sequence at all. Even killing major bosses might yield nothing more than a pat on the back. Rare is the game that puts you so thoroughly on your own.  That said, there are some big dings that make it more masochistic cult classic than masterpiece. For one, puzzles do branch into the realm of insane BS from time to time, and the game introduces (or rather, requires but does not introduce) a couple of unique environmental interactions along the way. Even if this kind of game is right in your sweet spot, keep the wiki bookmarked; you  will  need it at some point or another. Second, solving a puzzle triggers a confirmation sound effect, but the game doesn't show you  what  was unlocked or changed, which is a huge problem when the result is screens or entire zones away. And finally, things continue escalating in complexity all the way to the finale. While that would be fine in something like a platformer, here it means that you will absolutely be following a guide for the last big puzzle, and that it doesn't feel like you've come full-circle on the mysteries of La-Mulana so much as the it feels like the game just throwing more and more craziness at you.",

            "review_text": "Need another metroidvania to pad your library? This one is a gem. Just make sure you understand before you begin that this game is *intentionally designed* to be nightmarishly difficult at times. There are probably only a handful of (sane) human beings left on this planet that have actually finished this entire game with no external help from guides or walkthroughs. The gameplay and puzzles are not objectively impossible, but you will certainly feel the strain at least once or twice.  Gameplay aside, La Mulana has a disgustingly amazing soundtrack and fantastic writing to boot. All of these factors come together to really hit the nail on the head when it comes to drawing you into the atmosphere of the ruins themselves. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up: it's reasonably priced on a normal day, and you have little reason not to buy it during a sale. Best wishes, and good luck in the ruins!",

            "review_text": "Remember how you keep telling yourself you're gonna pick up that classic old book and read it to expand your horizons, but first you have to finish Lazytown on netflix? La-Mulana is that book for me. It's obviously made with a lot of love, and I love game designers who have no compunction about treating the players like mice in horrific and unpredictable cage. The difficulty is sharp, severe even, but fair. This is a game that will tax you as a player, this is not a carefree adventure title, but a serious and unforgiving platformer. The game has lot of detail and depth, if you have the stomach for it, you will likely get sucked in. The death and checkpoint routine is familiar and a little strict, but it's the context necessary for you to proceed with caution.",
