    "description": "The Westport Independent is a censorship simulator taking place in a post-war country, governed by the recently elected Loyalist Party. As the editor of one of the last independent newspapers in the country, your job is to remove and edit the content of your paper, affecting the people’s opinion of both the rebels and the Loyalist...",

            "review_text": "I am going to mark this as a recommendation, not because I wholeheartedly recommend this game but because Steam's review section is so limited. I would say, pick this up on a sale. TLDR; If you liked Paper's Please you'll like this but be warned it's MUCH shorter and also more limited.  I actually really did quite enjoy this, and I would disagree with some of the reviews around that say it doesn't provoke empathy as Papers Please did. No, it doesn't to the same degree, cos there is a smaller cast of characters; it's just you in your office with your writers after all. But it does match PP in that it still has that oppressive atmosphere that has you want to achieve a greater task against a bigger power holding you down, and the stories give the world a sense of place, with many running stories across each week. You will see through the eyes of this editor the many totalitarian practices the government is enforcing on its citizens, as well as the rebel's acts of terrorism (I do feel the story aspects are much more one sided on being anti government admittedly), and it is down to you to try and get the truth out without endangering yourself, your staff or your business. It feels like a reverse Ministry of Truth from 1984.  If you're a fan of Papers Please there's a lot to like here thematically, so why is there no unreserved recommendation? The major concern is that this is a much more limited game than PP.  First, it doesn't have the same gameplay; PP was like a puzzle game that required you to not only be accurate but quick for best results. This is just you making a choice - which articles to run, which sections in it to censor, which writer do you give it, where do the articles go in the paper in terms of priority, and to who do we market the paper to? This last variable however seems completely useless as far as I can tell, I'm not quite sure how your sales affect your playing experience frankly.  Occasionally, you will get menacing messages across your desk from government/rebel forces warning you of your actions, but as far as I can tell, as long as you don't max out your suspicion meter you're fine - don't seem to be any instant failure states like PP did.  It took me an hour to finish one run, and from what I can see endings aren't as varied as PP either; it's more a slide show of variables that are affected in binary ways, a la Fallout 3's ending.  If you can get it really cheap it's worth a look, it's not a bad game but it is quite limited 6/10",

            "review_text": "If you expect an ambitious game in the league of 'Papers, Please', you will be highly disappointed. This game takes less than thirty minutes to complete. Most people think it's too short, but personnaly it allowed me to do a few runs, whereas I did one game and a half of 'Papers, Please'. This way, you can try many things.  In my first run, I aligned with the government, which was very easy. In my following runs, I tried to make each district revolt. The South and East are easy to 'win'; the West and, above all, the North are super hard to turn around (they are lawful Loyalists in the beginning). This was where the game became challenging. I find it amusing to think that one of my hardest challenge in video games was to inform rich people through newspapers that their government is evil and that they should work against it. Who knew we would someday live in such a time...  However, I'm still unsure if the challenge is either very tough and complex or just plain unfair. I feel like you don't know enough about the mechanics. It seems like it's not any articles speaking against the government that will get to the North folks. What makes it even harder is that you have to avoid making the government suspicious; to influence the North, you will almost inevitably bust your limit. How do you find the balance? Lucas Pope, the creator of 'Papers, Please', created a free game with a similar concept to The Westport Independant called Republia Times (it was released before). It wasn't divided into districts, and the outcome of everything you did was obvious. Also, the gameplay consisted only of choosing which articles to publish, and how big they would be on the front page; you couldn't modify the titles or the content, and you didn't have to assign them to a specific journalist. Finally, there wasn't all the marketing side of the game; your articles were either political (which are not popular but are influential) or about celebrities or entertainement (which have the opposite effect). So it was simpler and more straightforward, but at the same time isn't it a bit boring if you're sure of the outcome, and if there's no challenge?  The community is so inactive that you can't expect to find a guide on the web. You can't even find a clear description of the achievements.   So yeah, I'm a bit mixed about all of this, but overall I had a great time and it was very compelling to try to make rebels out of the North folks (in which I succeeded! Yay for me :D ).",

If there was a way to make it longer, even DLC, I'd get it. 2. There are only a few hings you can do and it is in fact biased towards one side. But even with this it is an excelent game.",

You play the role of an editor who needs to guide his newspapers and his staff in an ever darker political landscape, always choosing between safety and truth.  I welcome powerful, thought provoking games like this one, and like Papers, Please or This War of Mine. The execution of TWI is not perfect, certainly not compared to Papers or This War, and the game certainly promises more depth than it delivers, but it still adds to the catalogue of thought provoking games, which is why I recommend it.",

            "review_text": "The Westport Independent has an interesting concept but it isn't backed up by its gameplay.   You are the editor of an independent paper and in 12 weeks the loyalist government will shut you down and enstate their own propaganda newspapers. What you must do is choose which articles are printed each week and which of your writers will write them. You can choose the headline of each article and delete any paragraphs in the articles. After a few in game weeks you also get to choose which articles get the front page and how much of your marketing budget to put into the four areas of the country. This is very simple and it basically tells you where to put your money. Moreover, there are only 2 headlines to pick for each article and a maximum of 4 paragraphs to censor. Each member of your group has a name and a sliver of a backstory, with information about whether they support the rebels of the loyalists. They also each have a comfort meter which will decrease if you force them to write articles they disagree with.  You really have to make your own goals in this game. You choose whether to publish articles about celebrities, industry or articles that praise or disparage the government. Each article you chose will affect your paper's popularity, the government's suspicion of you and the public's opinion on the rebels and the loyalists.   My problem with the game stems from the fact that there is no objective, no goals to reach for. You have to set your own. Do you want the public to support the rebels or the government, or will you focus on celeb gossip to sell papers. Normally I enjoy games where you make your own fun but there was little motivation to do anything in The Westport Independent. Personally I found it easy to sell papers as long as you put a bit of everything in and by the end my government suspision was ridiculously high with no negative effects apart from a few letters warning me not to badmouth the loyalists.  Your staff members can also be taken out by government officials if they write too much rebel propaganda but I found it hard to care as they have only barebones backstories and barely any personality. On top of that they're literally faceless, only being presented in silouhette. They do chat amongst each other in between levels but nothing really separated the characters other than two liked the loyalists and two liked the rebels. On that note, I found it hard to care for the paper as well. Sure I wanted it to do well but only because then there'd be no more levels to play. As for the rebels and the government I think the game needs to be less black and white and have a few more gray areas. In all the articles the government is clearly shown as evil and despotic or the paragon of kindness, should you choose the other headline. There's no middle ground and it makes it hard to want to support them in any way.  I gather that the point of the game is to make you endure the struggles of censorship in a world where your government is truly evil but the game fails to make this difficult and therefore it lacks impact. I managed to come up with a paper that was popular all over the country with litle government interference while disparaging them every chance I got.  The game ends very anticlimactically. You get a written description of what's now happening in each district of the country but it doesn't feel like anything has been achieved. This is a consequence of the lack of any objectives.   The game isn't all bad though. It's short and has a decent bit of music in.",
