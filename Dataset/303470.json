            "review_text": "A decent Tower Defence game. It really is overpriced, I'd suggest 4-5 bucks for it. You build, you defend, you upgrade, you repair (never liked TD games where you have to repair your towers). Protect the base. You have 100 lives/people. Graphics are not much of an interest, music is nor bad nor catchy. Maps are a bit of challenge. Towers variety is poor, I'd say. Enemies are regular (No NecroTanks or something that makes you say 'Wow!'). And the good thing is that no matter what all that together is fun. At least this game is more exciting than many of it's genre. I'd give Rush for Glory 6/10 in it's genre. Thank you for your attention.",
