            "review_text": "I was a little leary about buying this, with all the people talking about game breaking bugs, inconsistent translation, and numerous crashes, so I'm writing this because it's the sort of review that might have put my mind at ease.  While the translation is not completely consistent, it is ultimately understandable and honestly pretty well done for such a huge game. 90% of the dialogue in this game is not only understandable but decently written and engaging. The other 10% is either cut off by text boxes (I have encountered only 2 or 3 instances of this), hilariously bad google translate, or localisation that doesn't quite match the rest of the game (characters using British colloquialisms, a villain saying 'peace out', etc.). None of it is particularly damning or immersion killing, and a lot of it gave me a chuckle. So far I've been able to find answers to the untranslated quizes (such as the acupuncture point) either online or in the forum here. I should add that I have no experience or knowledge of the chinese language.   I have also not encountered any major bugs or issues. That doesn't mean you won't, I may just be lucky in this regard. For me, the keyboard and game are responsive with a controller plugged into my desktop and I haven't seen a single crash so far. In fact, it runs remarkably smooth for me.  Now I'm going to talk about why you should buy this game. There are very few kung fu RPGs out there, which is a shame. Jade Empire was decent but it suffered from Bioware's heavyhanded writing and the port was kind of a buggy mess, and I'm not familiar with any others like it. This game is far more open and ambitious than Jade Empire, and frankly better programmed (at least than the PC port).   Beyond that, it has an ambition that you don't see in RPG's anymore. While not strictly open world, there is an openness to this game in that it allows you to make your character into whatever you want, to make friends with whoever you want, and make choices that impact your character and the world he lives in. While there are some questionable design choices and I wish there was more information given in the UI, I absolutely appreciate the scope of this project and I think it was largely succesful.   My favorite part of the game, beyond watching my character improve from getting stomped by thugs into a respectable fighter, is how pretty and immersive it is. The graphics are admitedly a little dated, but honestly I find that charming in an age where everything is either hyperrealistic or retro, and the hand drawn scenes are very nicely done. The music, however, is where this game really draws you in.   This is a good game.",

There are key events which require you having outside knowledge about Chinese or the text is completely untranslated. It's frustrating to have your playthrough ruined because of these events.  If you want to sell it to western audiences, please make the game self-contained.",

Each phases have secrets and events that can improve your skills and relationship with the people you meet.  The banter between your master/senior pupils are excellent written.   Highly recommended for fans of kungfu RPG games such as Jade Empire. It reminds me of traditional cRPG like Baldur's gate, Pillars of Eternity(but with a well developed kungfu system).",

Never give up, keep going to develop the game i will support you. --------------------------------------------------------  This game is quik difficult by who is no understand chinese. I know this game have english version, but the translation is......quik difficult to understand by who is no understand chinese, like Budha zhang.What the zhang meaning ? If i am westerrn people who is no understand chinese how can i understand what the Budha zhang meaning ? Why not translate the Budha zhang to Budha hand ?  The translation of the word 內功 also have the problem, i no understand why the 內功 translate to internal ? I know difference betwwen the eastern and western culture. But i think the proper 內功 is forces of the internal body like what the western people believe is mana. Maybe the word internal forces is better used by translation for this game. ---------------------------------------------------------  This game is no english walkthrough, so the english player who no understand chinese will be feel difficult to start the game.  Here is some tip：  1.Internal is most importance skill in this game. Please spend lot of time to training the internal. 2.Eye and Ear skill don't need to training. Because in the second year june end the ET will help you max the skill of the ear and eye in the jungle. All you have to do is max the relationship for Xu and Xu young brother before second year june end. 3. All martial art skill is same useful, but you must specialist. If you play fist please don't waste time to play other style.  4.Year 4 is the real challenge by this game. All you to do in this game just for preparation by year 4. All you to do is just for year 4. 5.Please takecare you relationship by other friend. Speacially the Fujianhan is you best teammate.  Most importance tip : When you master allow you going out to adventure, please spend 2 time per month to adventure. Adventure is the importance parts in this game.  Before you start this game, you must know this game have 5 storylines. The storylines is Tianwang storyline, Mengzhu storyline, Evil storyline, help emperror storyline and anti emperror storyline.  Mengzhu storyline is most easily entry storyline, you always sleeping in 4 year also can entry this storyline.   Most challenge storyline is Tianwang storyline and evil storyline. Tianwang storyline is the true ending for this game. But Tianwang storyline is very difficult to entry without any walkthrough.  By first time player i suggest try to playing the Mengzhu storyline first.  Who is like to try to doing the bad guy can entry the evil storyline. You will became the final boss in this game. In evil storyline you will fight all martial art clans master stand by justice side. You are evil in evil storyline.",

The writing is really funny (possibly due to poor translation) and the ability to build up your character from a joke who gets beaten by random thugs to a hugely powerful martial arts master in your own way is fantastic!

Honestly, it's hard to RECOMMEND recommend this game. This thing is NOT for everyone (as my opening statement should indicate). On top of the obvious WTF idea of combining those types of games this thing still has a few bugs, untranslated sections, and a difficulty thats less of a curve and more of a three dimensional shape of some sort. And yet... it all kind of works. I strongly suggest reading a few reviews, watching a few videos, and taking those vastly different pictures in the game preview seriously. You will likely need a guide or walkthrough for several facets of the game, such as the accupuncture challenges. But one of the reasons I still recommend the game after all this is that it's such a DIFFERENT experience. It definately has it's flaws but its such a unique entry into the field in so many ways. Yes, many parts of it are familiar but the mix is a heady brew, especially to the RPG genre which (after some debate with myself) I guess is the closest thing to a genre this game has.",

In fact, I'm not sure if there is a menu. - The art styles clash - most of it is in traditional Chinese art styles, but then there are random anime popups.
