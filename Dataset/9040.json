    "description": "After defeating Shub-Niggurath, you arrive back at your home base on Earth, but it's not all blue skies and butterflies. Apparently, not all QUAKE forces have been subdued. Chaos ensues as you blast your way through the QUAKE minions and toward the infested gateway. Your only choice is to find the source of evil and shut it down.",

I very much enjoyed playing through this decent lengthed mission pack. This game should have been the ending of Quake 1 it concludes better than Quake does.",

Good things:  -The game did not be worse.  -A few new weapons and desing.    Bad Things:  -Still does not include the original musics.  -Still need install the [Quke Ultimate Patch] and disable the Steam-overlay.    My recommendation same as my first review. If you miss that,  you can read here! ",

            "review_text": "After completing the original QUAKE, you may think you're the biggest bad-♥♥♥ this side of QUAKE-con. But after you play the first level of Scourge of Armagon, you realise you're wrong. You're actually just getting started.  This mission pack is lengthy and difficult and so is an absolute gift to QUAKE lovers and masochists alike. More challenging enemies, such as the brutal Scorpian robots and the weapon stealing Gremlins, combined with a handful of new and interesting weapons, like Mjolnir (That's Thor's hammer!) and a Prox-Mine gun, this mission pack injects new elements into a game that you may think you have mastered.  The long levels are a true test of the player's ability, especially on the Hard and Nightmare difficulties. If you are wanting to brave them, be ready for attrition against a rabbling horde of 180 enemies a level that are ALL more deadly than you.  It'll leave you sweating and battered, but no game is quite as rewarding when finished as QUAKE: Scourge of Armagon.  Recommended for Quake veterans and/ or people who want a challenge!",

The new enemies are really good, and the new weapons are fun to use as well. I enjoyed the last boss being more of a shoot-him-up scenario than the showdown with Shub in Q1. Level designs are a little more clever and innovative than the first Quake.",
