            "review_text": "The short of it: This game is really good, BUT ONLY WITH THE EXPANSION! DO NOT BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME NAKED!  Unlike a lot of 4X games, Endless Space is more about building your empire than about developing your colonies or really fighting wars. Not that you won't fight wars, the AI is usually vicious enough to wait and plot and it will build up an overwhelming force based on your existing military might before waging war on you. And it WILL do that. Every single chance it can, unless it can't, it will do that. Never think it won't, since it has no reason not to.  We'll get more into that later, but right now let's focus on the empire-building. Building up the empire is the primary focus of this game. Oftentimes if you look at too little at a time, you'll tunnel vision yourself into a corner when you should be keeping yourself as distant as possible. A prime example of this is expressed in happiness. The morale of a system and its subsequent production bonuses are NOT more important than the overall happiness of your empire. After all, a 15% production bonus across 4 stars is better than a 30% bonus in just one. If, when settling a new system, you have a planet with lots of production, or a planet with a high amount of happiness-boosting, you pick the one that makes your empire happy, or you lose the game.  Now then, let's talk about war. War is problematic in this game because A) it's inevitable, and B) it's boring. The game takes a very hands-off approach to combat and in the vanilla game technology is both everything and a linear arms race. The guy with the most ship tonnage and the best weapons will always win. You can employ tactics cards, but these will only have a minimal impact on the outcome. This leads to a very boring experience, and can force you into certain types of tech progression and thus certain modes of gameplay. To deviate from established doctrine is to lose in the vanilla game.  DO NOT PLAY THE VANILLA GAME. Instead, do yourself a favor and get the Disharmony expansion. The Disharmony expansion does away with about 75% of the weapon-tech in favor of just four generations of guns. Each is a sizable improvement over the last generation, and keeping up the with the AI is definitely important, but with tactics, ship design, aimpoint selections, and formation management you can steal victory from the jaws of supposedly assured defeat.  Endless Space encourages you to use your distant veiw not to mess with the minutae of your own empire, but rather to mess with the other guys. Through trade, trade routes, blockades, invasions, explorations, treaties, and wars you are charged to take away the choices of the enemy for as long as possible while you improve your own choices. How you do this is entirely up to you, and Endless Space: Disharmony actually allows you quite a bit of wiggle room on how you do it.",

I really do like 4x games and this one started rough (I mean it was all but unplayable) but with the continual development and improvement pumped into it by the publisher it's gotten to be quite decent. It's definitely mature and I haven't had a crash in a long time. I see they're taking what they learned from this development experience and making a new game in the series. Looking forward to that one and if you're looking for a time killer with a lot of playability, well then this is it. A great buy.",

            "review_text": "This game is like an attractive girl with some very bad habits and/or attitudes. I tried to love this game, I tried to overlook the bugs, but I can't, they are too obvious. It is a good game, but sometimes, I cannot tell if some of the stuff they have are supposed to be features or bugs. For example, enemies can move during MY turn. If I wanted my enemies to move at the same time as me, I would go back to Sins of a Solar Empire.   Bugs  Another frustrating thing is that my main fleet was trapped in a star system for X amount of turns because the AI, for whatever reason, decided to send 10 individual ships to that same system and set them on blockade mode. I can only kill 1 at a time so the chances of that fleet leaving on its own was close to zero, unless I mount a rescue.   Diplomacy  The diplomacy is broken beyond believe. AIs often offer star systems and resources as part of their Cease Fire agreements. However, these agreements would be undone next turn, because the systems they surrendered contain the same resources in the agreement, so they have no more resources to pay me. Another thing that is annoying is that I do not understand why 'create alliance', 'cease fire' and such needed to be researched. When someone is beating your @$$, you would instinctively yell 'stop', not to these advance space beings apparently.   Tutorial  The tutorial is inadequate at best. After going through the whole tutorial, I still don't grasp the important points of the game such as battles and ship designs until I googled them. I figured the rest out because of my past experience with Alpha Centauri and Civ.   AI  The AIs are dumb and overly aggressive. By 20-30 turns, my closest neighbour declared war on me for absolutely no reason at all. At least in AC or Civ, they would give you some sort of warning, but not Endless Space! It will f--k you when it feels like f--king you up, regardless of their capabilities. And they refuse to make peace when they just lost all their ships. Based on my reading on multiplayers, it seems that it is buggy as hell online as well. So this game doesn't have much going for it, since you can't play with the AIs and you can't play with other people.   Difficulty  In Civ V, they have a nice range of difficulties, ranging from settler to deity (8 levels). In ES, they have something similar too. However, the problem is that the gaps between each is as wide as the Grand Canyon. Say, ES's normal is like Civ's Chieftain or Warlord, its hard mode is like Deity. So either the game is too easy for you to learn from, or it is so hard that you just can't survive past the 100th turn. I was either bored or frustrated.   Research  Regardless of your fraction, you almost always research the same techs every time. Colonize planets, Enhances weapons, Make ships bigger, Enhances more weapons, Make ships even bigger, with the occasional resource unlocking, incoming increasing, happiness inducing tech here and there.   Victory Warning  While I appreciate the game for telling me that the AIs are winning, it doesn't need to start reminding me when they are only 10-20% complete toward certain victories. A even more ridiculous example is when I am at 60% completion, they warn me of this AI who is close to winning the game at 20%. Very helpful indeed.   Conclusion  I paid around $15 in Nov of 2013 for both Endless Space and Disharmony. I want my money back and I am trying to save yours here. This game is great in the sense that it is like Alpha Centauri but on a galactic scale. It's like Civ 5 with levelable heroes. The management/production system is nice. But everything else is not. The concept is great but it is very poorly executed or maintained (based on my investigation, a lot of bugs seemed to stem from Disharmony).  I have uninstalled this game after close to 100hours of play and it will take a major cleansing for me to reinstall it and give it another go. This game as it stands is worth $5 at best, anymore, you are getting ripped off. Spend your money elsewhere. Thanks for reading.   Update/Sales  Jun.25, 2014 - currently at $7.49USD (75% off). Best discount I have seen since I bought the game. If this game interests you and you don't mind the bugs/features, then GO FOR IT quick. It is a good price.",

It's a great idea but I would have liked to see it done differently. Then a few crashes/bugs here but other then that very stable for the most part.

I also love the fully visible tech tree where you can plan ahead, even more so after playing a few games with 'randomly available technologies'. It pains me to see it getting mixed reviews nowadays. I mean sure it has it's problems, you can't control ships in combat, but you still have strategy cards, formations, and massive hero bonuses. That's more than recent game Stellaris has in their combat system. After playing several other 4x's i always find myself comparing them to Endless Space, almost like its the par for the course.

You can play in a randomly generated galaxy, the size of your own choosing, with up to 8 opponent empires. Endless Space also allows for full modding and multiplayer capability.   There are several stock empires ready for you to play as, or you can choose to create your own. You start in your capital system and then must explore nearby systems, colonize new planets, research and unlock new technologies, locate strategic resources to upgrade and more. As turn-based games go, this game was a lot of fun. I spent Five hours playing and ended up not getting much done in the way of review writing yesterday. The Space combat portion of the game, involves a different type of combat. Other reviews and game analysis have referred to it as akin to Rock-Paper-Scissors, and I think that is a pretty valid observation. Of course you can always allow the computer to auto-resolve the conflict, in which case the game takes into account the type and strength of ships involved in the conflict and randomly generates an outcome.   All in all, I enjoyed Endless Space - Emperor Edition and may go out on the web to look for player-created Mods to make the game more challenging. If you enjoy these types of turn-based strategy games, give Endless Space a try.",

Not easily presented in a way that at least I could retain. All that said if you don't mind some research and a lot of trial and error with many failures, there is plenty to love about the game.

In easy or normal difficulty, before you got the dreadnaught everything seems to be pretty simple and easy, AI may fight back for a couple of times but they never pose a real threat. Still, later in the game, when you think you would be able to crush the AI with the dreadnaught and a whole advanced fleet , you would be surprised - all of a sudden all the AI fleet got around 90% deflect rate shield, and a couple of destroyers can easily wipe your entire fleet without hurting themself at all.

Some things still unclear - insane AI eg.: I) you control half the galaxy with highly developed colonies with the gold(dust) specialized race. your income: 150 gpt another faction's with half your territory: 1500gpt.  II) you are usually happy with a 10K power fleet. Other factions even the pacifist ones often has 40K+ fleets.

Seems to be a huge bottle neck when upgrading ships after 2-3 of the initial cycles. Getting to 4-5 is almost end game, yet your ships can't compete against the AIs unless they are top of the line always. AI always seems to not have to deal with money issues, empire favor, or long research times. Graphics are very basic. Terraforming would be great if not for it being at the very end game when you don't need it.

            "review_text": "Long do 4x space TBS fans await for a true worthy successor of Master of Orion I &amp; 2, and like few decent iterations that spawned over the last 15 years, Endless Space can be ..... ' close to Orion, but not quite '...  For an indie production value however, this game shows remarkable efforts put to the overall artistic eye candy, for probably the best looking game of the genre at its release. Micromanagement exhibits several similarities with MoO and various clones, decent throughout but space combat remains shallow despite what the developers wanted to bring with their card system ( long/medium/short range ). Ship design could have been more flexible, few customisable options buried within an unintuitive user interface. Though the AI performs surprisingly well at a strategic level, signs of coding flaws at some tactical level like invasion or ship upgrades offset ( a bit ) an otherwise challenging game even for experienced players. It may be intentional or not, yet the game has a plethora of hidden features and buried formulae that even a ' galactic pedia' from AAA games couldn't cover entirely.  Pros: artistic direction; galactic settings; strategic planning; rightly paced micromanagemnt; some specific factions coerce the player to rethink whole new strategy and ways to expand ( namely Harmony, Cravers ); soothing audio track.  Mixed bag: AI ( like the vast majority of strategy games anyway ).  Cons: generic combat system; user interface ( many fonts too small also ); ship design needs more work; too many ways to win FOR the few ones that really matter for both AI and player; lack of some value to colonizing &amp; terraforming ( untapped potential here ).  Bottom line: recommended to hardcore fans of the genre.",

Immense and intricate but then hampers or limits the player in one way or another.

Open trade routes? Research first. It gets obnoxious when it comes time for trading resources.   Say you want to trade X number of your anti-mater for X number of their space peaches. First you have research the ability to recognize anti-mater as a resource and then research the ability to trade it.  The same issue happens when it comes to fleet customization. The ability to build your own warships and customize their load out was one of the things that drew me to this game. Cause let's be honest, that's ♥♥♥♥ing cool.  You select your chassis and the type of armarments you want. Make a ship that's all offense, all defense, or somewhere in between.  The problem comes first with the lack of real-time combat. It's honestly the biggest dissapointment. But you get the option to watch cinematic of the destruction and imagine what it would be like to actually play.  Because there's no real-time combat like the Total War series, you can't tell your fleet to target the weakest, strongest, or ship with the lowest current HP. You can't flank, you can't really do much of anything. This could have been solved with more attack formations, but we only get 3.  Combat in Endless space is a card game.

The plus side is you're not bored after long while playing this game,it adds variety to the game play, slightly opens up the multitude of outcomes, and gives a sense of control to the players which is unmatched in the entire game. 2.The tech tree is unique in that it has four varieties: diplomacy, applied sciences, military, exploration. Each has its own flavor. Military provides might, diplomacy gives keys to diplomacy, applied science sometimes reveals new resources or helps in development of a star system, exploration lets you colonize new planets and star systems. Together they give a unique blend to the game play. 3.Exploration of the galaxy is fun for any newb or experienced player alike  ---------------------------------CONS----------------------------- 1.Some technolgies hold the key to survival. For example if you dont discover wormhole travel you cannot travel to other planets or star systems, similarly if you dont discover applied technologies you are more then likely not going to discover hidden advantages of certain resources. 2.The game uses a point system for rating players. Problem is, once your points overtake any of the A.I.s the A.I. attacks you where you're more than likely to lose the war. So its advisable to move ahead of the pack All in all its a 6.5/10 and definitely worth the buy, if you can handle a bit of warfare maneuvers from the A.I. and have the spirit to colonize the galaxy.",

There are a number of factors that make replayability extremely high, including the wildly diverse tech trees, unique factions, race-specific technologies, advantages, and disadvantages...  ...but my god. The tutorial system.  As someone whose job description includes writing how-tos, I can say, with tenured authority, that their tutorial system is absolutely horrible.  The 'tutorials' are screens that pop up the first time you play, and give you a screen cap (of a sampel screen) with numbers, and a wall of text on the right. No context, nothing leading you through--it's like getting an instruction manual, whose pages are only accessible while you're playing the game. To put it into context, it's as though you were taught to play Monopoly using a tutorial that didn't tell you that you could buy houses until you've acquired your first set by pure accident.  There's no campaign, no tutorial mission, no walk-through, no 'live example'--hell, the damn thing doesn't even tell you how the various win conditions work.  Which, with a game as rich and deep as Endless Space, is absolutely appauling.  What's worse, the complete lack of interactivity makes the tutorials extremely boring, and the fact that it only pops up to let you read once you've encountered an immediate need for it means that these boring walls of text will pop up as you're finally getting into the action, bringing the whole experience to a grinding halt.  If you've got a lot of time and patience to learn all the subtle nuances (mostly on your own, since the tutorials, boring as they might be, are also woefully inadequate in offering context), then you'll likely (eventually) get a hell of a kick out of Endless Space.  For everyone who doesn't have that kind of time, and just wants to be able to jump on, colonize some planets, sign a treaty, kill a bug, and shuffle along your merry way, then I cannot warn you vehemently enough about how throughly the tutorial will ruin your gaming experience.",

            "review_text": "Endless Space is a turn-based strategy, sci-fi 4X game developed by Amplitude Studios, and published by Iceberg Interactive. In this review I will be listing some of the pros and cons that this game has to offer.  Let's start off with the pros: +Beautiful soundtrack (one of my favourite tracks from the soundtrack is The Endless (Choir Version)) +The UI is fairly clean and nice looking, as it fits with the futuristic time period that the game takes place in. +Creating and joining a game in Endless Space is easy and there is no annoying errors that prevent you from playing with your friends. +The customization for the galaxy that you play in is great; and I also like how they added a option to set the galaxies age, I found that pretty cool. +Animations and transitions for tabs and the hud are fluid and makes the UI more enjoyable to use. +Decent amount of empires +The empire names and appearance are amazingly made and drawn, I haven't seen one faction that I thought wasn't well made. +The lore behind the empires (and the game), are crazily detailed with the perfect amount of text to back it up. Aside from that the actual stories are very intriguing, and I spent a long time reading them without losing a single bit of intrest.  +Custom race maker +The perks for each race are a nice edition, like the Sophons being mainly scientific, but they are fairly weak, etc. (adds more thought put into choosing a race rather than just choosing a race because you liked their appearace.) +Option to change your empire colour +Endless Space has in fact the best artwork I've ever seen in a game, and the fact that some of the artwork is in the loading screens, makes the loading screens more enjoyable to look at. +Optimization is great +Backgrounds for the galaxy in-game look beautiful +Ship design is phenomenal (My favourite ship designs are the Harmony, the Sophons, and the Automatons) +Each star and planet are highly detailed and have great names +Managing your solar systems (and tax) are very complex and requires a lot of attention if you don't want your empire going into rebellion. +The research tree for the game is... just.... AMAZING. So many options, and sheer amout of research you can do, is just magnificent. Endless Space has the best research tree that I've ever seen in a strategy game; and is one of my favourite parts of the game, to be honest. +Exploring through the vast galaxy is fun and simple to do +Choosing different productions for each star system adds more strategic planning to do +Random events are great and suprising +Empire AI is superb +Special planets are a nice addition +Different types of ships (Colony, Defender, Scout, etc,) are good with their different stats and functions. +The fact that they added a option for you to build your own type of ship and modify it for different jobs to do is just exceptional +Space fights are cool +Free camera movement and a locked camera for space battles +Trade routes and just trading alone is fun +Diplomatic screen looks beautiful and is very clean +Many different type of resources and luxury resources +Different actions (in a card shaped format) to choose from for you next space battle +Population of a star system have their own opinions +Graphics are decent I think I'll stop listing pluses now, because I could list them forever.  Lets head on to the cons of Endless Space. -Game breaking glitches here and there (for example, me and my friend encountered a glitch where the game was stuck on standby for 30 minutes, and never went to the next turn. We had to restart Endless Space and revert to our last autosave to fix it.) -Don't turn on the A.I. to manage your star system, like if you turn on the A.I. for one star system, the A.I. may tear that star system down to hell, causing that one to go into rebellion. I don't really recommend turning the A.I. on for managing the star systems, manage it yourself. -Graphics options are simple and not the detailed, not allowing you to tweak it for the best preformance.  well, I guess there isn't that much bad things about this game then.   Endless space is a outstanding game that is now one of my favourite strategy games, beautiful work Amplitude Studios!  86/100",

A single game could last you entire days to complete depending on how you set it up. The game can be a little slow at first which could be a turn off for those who prefer RTS instead of Turn based strategy.   Space combat in this game revolves around research, ship build, and card choice. There is no actual individual control of the units in the fleet assembled during battle. It's basically two fleets go head to head until one overpowers the other in quite the spectacular light show.   Overall, I like it. I'm usually more of the 'straight into the action' strategy game player but this game is still something I'd recommend for those who want a 4x game to play.

The Dust resource adds another layer of strategy to both building and warfare as it can be used to speed up production and construction, or to activate leaders abilities before battles to give your fleets an edge. The base game is fine with the AI being quite aggressive, however many great mods are available to further add more races, tech, colonizable planet types, and other tweaks and can be used in multiplayer so long as both parties possess the same mods. I recommend this game for anyone who likes 4X and likes to relax while building up thier galactic civilization for hours on end.",

I know, I know, The Endless are the missing ancient race in this 4X. Maybe they have the knowledge the Cravers need to make their burgers. That works.

No other genre has the power to keep me going, turn after turn, well past the time that any sane person would have collapsed from sleep deprivation. I grew up on Master of Orion, and I honestly have to say that I enjoy it more than MoO or MoO2. That's mostly due to the convenience improvements that this game has over those older games, plus it just looks beautiful. The 'synchronous turn' approach works brilliantly.  Ship combat is a bit of a mixed bag, though. I do miss the turn-based combat of MoO, but I recognize the advantages of the CCG-style approach. Ship combat could get tedious in MoO and often wasn't that compelling, since it didn't require a great deal of strategy. In Endless Space, each battle is over quickly, and battles over star systems can last many turns. This means that each battle could be just a small part of a larger, ongoing conflict that is much more interesting. On the other hand, I'm not a big fan of the weapons system. I honestly don't know why you should pick one weapon type over another, but it just so happens that the weapon type I chose worked pretty well. *shrug*  I could go on with the comparisons to MoO, but most of you probably haven't played it. Basically, this is a really great 4X, empire-building game. I highly recommend you give it a try. It could be a bit daunting at first, though, so I'd recommend starting light with a 'throwaway' session, where you just try things to see what happens.

Also, when they offer a deal, there is no way to negotiate it; you either accept it or reject it. Civilization IV is probably best at diplomacy.  There is good skill tree to learn, and good options for building and customizing your ships and fleets.  I would like more info available, such as defensive details per planet/system, that sometimes is missing, but I don't find that a major setback.

The game is nearly perfect and you are missing nothing of the usual science fiction stuff, when you are playing it. You really make no mistake if you buy it. The game is not difficult to play but it could be that it is finished sometimes to fast. The research tree is consisting on four branches but you need not research all steps. If you concentrate yourself on one of the many victory ways you will surely win. The metascore of the game is 77; i would say that an 80 is justified. The game is pure fun and the known feature „terraforming“ opens you many ways to build a perfect galactic empire.  Achim Hamm",

It is worth mentioning, that I don't play this game on the higher difficulties which means that this review might not reflect the experience of those who do play on higher difficulties. I do believe that the game can become a bit boring in the mid- to lategame unless the focus lies on military expansion. The boredom will, however, be mitigated by learning technologies that allows for further colonization of different planet types. Furthermore, wars can, in my experience, become tedious since they easily become very focused on production and the mangement of damaged ships.   On a final note, I want to mention a couple of positives. Besides from the beautiful combat cinematics, there are two things that I particularly enjoy about the game. Firstly, it is the advisors. These people, of all species, will aid the empire they are working for with their special skills and they can be specialized according to the players prefference. Secondly, I found the different species and the customization to be a fun factor. Mostly because it feels like the species are played differently from each other, and that they often have noticeable boons, and in some cases even drawbacks. I like the ability to create a new species, but the customization options are somewhat limited and it often feels like it is restricted to what already exists.  In the end, I'd probably recommend this game, especially if it is on sale.",

Researh has 4 distinctive paths to follow, each allow for different progressions through the game. ?Getting the end will warrent a vitory on either path, however you need points in the others to actually do anything useful.

Since this is a 4x game I thought, like most good 4x games that gameplay would be self intuitive. Turns out I was wrong. First time you enter the game you are greeted by walls of text and diagrams for a 'tutorial' You spend the first 50 turns figuring out the game and wondering why your score is miserably behind. 100 turns later you lose to an economic vitory by the computer player to which there is nothing you can do about it. ♥♥♥♥ing lovely for an 'easy' mode.  The ship battles are lame. The fleets line up and take pop shots at each other with 3 different kinds of weapons. The only in battle abilities come from these cards you play that makes the whole battle feel like rock paper scisors. It offers nothing of the joy that you get from games like homeworld or Sins. You have some customization options but again the game poorly explains that too so you also spend the first 50 turns wondering why the destroyer you just researched is no where to be found. in the end instead of mixed fleets you end up with 2 types of fleets. First one consists of mini missle boats whose objective and sole purpose is to take out the second fleet type. The second fleet type consists of your most high tiered ship armed with as many defenses and singular guns as possible. Nothing else is viable.  The few guides I managed to find on this game barely give any point in the right direction. Also it seems that according to the community that the game is very unbalaced and also 'anti-human', as in no human race faction is competitve against the other races in any sense. The different races barely offer any true difference in gameplay, just different focuses. If that doesn't turn you off then the diplomacy text boxesthat feel like they were written by a twelve year old will...  Finally and what REALLY turned me off is the random events that occur in game that only affect the human player. What's this? A deadly plague that offers you 3 options to go screw yourself with? Ok you think to yourself, if this will hamper me then surely the computer is having a hard time too. 20 turns later the computer is double your score with advanced tech and ships and you got NOTHING. Yep thats balanced...   If you want a 'good' 4x experience then lok else where. You like the whole 'civilization' style? Look elsewhere too. Feel like playing a medocre 4x game? Play this alongside sword of the stars 2 and the other crappy 4x titles. Do yourself a favor and put your time toward better things.",

The battle scene is quite sad! You are literally watching a 60 second clip where the ship move to one direction while the other is right behind them. There is not a lot of options you can choose from during a battle except for selecting 'Battle Cards' which if you play the game for quite some time, it gets pretty boring and repititive.   The ship design is unimaginative piece of crap. Also, upgrading a ship changes the stats but not the appearance which can really break focus on the game.

I still can't seem to find where it shows how much you're paying on maintenance for your fleets. There's a published formula but why can't I see it at a glance?  That said, the game is very pretty. The artwork is beautifully done. The gameplay is pretty good, though the AI sucks (which seems to be a consistent theme with this developer ... Endless Legend AI sucks too.) It's playable even on older computers and the storyline is engrossing. The default races are wonderfully done. The technology tree has had a lot of thought put into it and is fascinating just to read through if you're a fan of science fiction.   In short, the game is worth playing (especially if you can pick it up on a sale) but it's not as good as even Space Empires IV in terms of a strategic/tactical 4x.

The best UI of all time award from me goes to this game, easy and intuitive I often find my self cussing other games UI's more often after I have played this game. The create your own race feature is nearly flawless. I only wish more depth in look customization and that there were some way to design our own main abilitiy or choose from a longer list, even if items on said list didn't come from one of the premade races. Other than that you have a lot of options to make a race just how you like (because of Pax Imperia's greatness I will always love and be extra critical on this feature).

Manual supposedly lets you choose 'cards' to play but is basically a cut scene. Auto just skips the cutscene. Unless your fleet is massively larger than the other fleet, it will be a draw. Invading other systems seems to be if your invade score is bigger than their defend score. Then how long it takes is dependant on the difference. So, if your attacking score is 3600 and their defend score is 2500, then it will only take about 60 turns to invade. Snore.

It has incredible immersion thanks to the realistic graphics, unique lore and the highest attention to detail I have ever seen. It's so much fun being a galactic leader, wondering which planet on which system you should colonise to then terraform to help out your economy to keep the upkeep on spaceships steady whilst they invade the enemy's home planet so that you can unlock the technology to harvest from the falling metorites on that hydrogen gas planet you really like. You can see how much depth Amplitude have put into the mechanics to make it interesting, and they've really done a fantasic job of it. Whilst I do enjoy other strategy games like Civ, they just become so boring when you already know everything in the game after a couple of hours of playtime. 46 hours into Endless Space, and I've barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer. Even if you somehow know everything about the game, the community has got you covered in the the form of multiplayer, mods and the workshop. However, because of how vast Endless Space is, it is quite a struggle to get into the basics and the poor tutorial doesn't help. The game is relatively costly, especially with the expansion packs, so it would be wise to get this game on sale if you're skeptical or not to passionate about strategy games. Definitely get the Emperor Edition if you're into games like these.",

The Custom civs pretty much also to a few bonus changes while you retain the structure of one of the pre made civs. All around it's a simplistic game that's fun but it's not a Sword of the Stars replacement.",

I know I do, and Endless Space pushes all those buttons just right.    There are so many options that the game can seem intimidating at first, but the UI is incredibly user-friendly and easy to navigate while the game comes in varied difficulty from granny mode to juggernaut levels of play. You're not going to understand the whole game at a glance, so if you're looking for something no more mentally challenging than an FPS, this is not the game for you. However, once you do grasp it, it provides you with the tools to play the game in new and creative ways every single time.   Since its original creation this game has been updated and expanded(mostly free of charge) into something far superior to the original product. Critics rightly pointed out the flawed combat, semi-bland universe, and wildly unbalanced starting situations in multiplayer. However, every single one of these problems has been thoroughly handled by the devs at Amplitude. The universe is still not top of the line in terms of interesting story-telling, but the combat has been fleshed out to an absurd level and the unfair luck of the early game has been almost entirely eliminated.   In short, if you like 4X strategy games, get this one. It's currently the most solid one on the market due to the horribly botched coding of Civ 5. If you don't like them, don't bother, this game is 4X to the core with nothing particularly unusual to offer a player who doesn't care for the genre.",

The races all really give their own unique play style to the game while remaining similar enough that you don't have to re-learn the basics for each race (The Harmony from the DLC are the exception to this rule) and diplomacy between the factions works well even if the AI is somewhat silly at times in regards to what they think is appropriate for trade. (Having an AI trade away the last of his planets for a peace treaty doesn't really 'work' in their favor... at all)   The Ship customization isn't up to the caliber that you would find in Galactic Civilization or even MOO2, but it does give you the flexibility to really customize your ships into specific roles. If you want a fleet of Missleboats you can do that; Carriers, sure!  The research tree is exciting and there are several techs that really give you a sense of making a choice for the order of research. Sadly there are no 'This or That' techs so it is just a matter of time to research everything. (assuming you can last that long)   The two major draw backs I have in the game are:  1. Combat is boring. For all the customization you can do to your fleets, it boils down to a RPS card power case where you are just watching your ships do the actions you've pre-selected. There is no strategy, no outmaneuvering or superior tactics in anyway. My friends and I simply just auto all of our combat now, half because it slows down multiplayer games waiting to load in and out of combat, and two because there isn't really much point to watching the cinematic fight after you've seen it a few times.   2. Victory conditions aren't shared between allies, so if you and a friend are playing a co-op game only one of you can win in the end. This is a big let down that I am really hoping gets addressed at some point in a future patch.",

Perhaps the games biggest failing is the lack of perspective into the goings on of the world. Sure you have the alien avatars, manual space battles, and really beautiful art, you don't get to see what life looks like or how certain negotiations between factions appear.   Or to be more clear, the game sacrifices 'show' for 'tell, but in a detailed, clean, and clear way'.  But if that is a failing it is a minor one and the only one. The depth of gameplay is hardly sacrificed because of it. Though there is always room for improvement I think what we have here is a very solid, well made, and comprihensive galactic civilization simulator. A great adition to the 4X genre.

            "review_text": "After a few hours, you'll find Endless Space a bit simple compared to many other modern civ games, but you'll know why that's not a bad thing. This is a very well polished and balanced game, and stands out for its focus on straight-forward design choices.  Where many civ games take weeks of play to get a handle on good practices, where war or other ends will have you dreading their management, Endless Space provides easy terms and informative tooltips for what you're looking at, or looking to accomplish.  The most significant difference in Endless Space compared to other games is the method of exploration: hex-tiles these are not. Each system is connected to others in spokes of preset flight paths, which are traveled in warp according to the speed you equipped your ships with, and movement cannot be changed once a fleet leaves for another system. This makes strategy in movement much different, and often results in simpler movement tactics than in hex or territory-based games, but you will find that simple doesn't mean easy, especially once you or your neighbors research the ability to forego these causeways and launch scouts or invasions deep within your territory. Hope you've got long-ranged scanners.  Scattered throughout the galaxies will be ruins left by the mysterious and ironically named Endless, which directly or indirectly placed many of the races on their paths to meet. These relics provide unique modifiers available on certain planets, and often require certain technological ability to take advantage of. The result is mostly in the numbers, but the wonderfully written tooltips put you right on the ground--or gas giant, as it were.  Tech trees are an important factor for any civ lover, and Endless Space understands this. The trees are split into four paths which each interweave with themselves, providing nonlinear expansion options. The trees are fun to explore as they open up new exploration options for your galaxy both abroad and within your borders such as scanning moons, colonizing new planet types, unlocking new resources, travel options, and new ship customizations, all which drastically change the game as you advance. Even with a strong focus on research, the game has a way of coaxing you into keeping to one or two limbs in each main branch, which can feel limiting, but makes for a unique playthrough each time, and some adaptability is always available as the sub-branches intersect as they fan out. You will often need to ponder various coinciding tech tree plans to accomplish your longterm goals, and will juggle each main branch to satisfy these needs. These research options really do feel like research.  The exhaustive customization options for your ships will keep you on your toes as your foes will eventually adapt to your fleet tactics, and you must try to do the same. In that sense, ship design can tip too heavily toward one of the three RPS-style offensive or defensive types in short-term, but over the lifetime of a game, you'll find things mixing up more as your saved ship designs join mixed-tactic fleets, especially as you engage other factions which have advanced in their own way. Once in battle, the unique three-stage combat system adds another level of elegant complexity with long range, medium range, and melee range, with each three weapon systems available for each range. The tactical cards used to change battle tactics in the fray add yet another level of choice, and you can unlock more of them, making combat more engaging than in other games without going full turn-based tactical battles. These choices focus on a few factors at a time, made dynamic through the quantity of subsequent choices you'll have to make, without overwhelming you, which is a design philosophy you'll notice throughout the game.  The game allows open hostilities in colonized systems that have not yet reached the level of stability to project influence, which provides for an interesting expansion era before things go diplomatic on you. The inability to effectively siege planets early on is also a deciding factor for how you will make you first moves, perhaps containing expansion by force rather than rushing to meet it with your own. You'll need good engines, and may regret holding them back from too far. Every turn will have you planning your expansion, research, and system improvements in sync, and dynamic events and AI will both keep you shifting priority.  The races are unique and well-written, and can be customized. The lore of the game is overall much more engaging and easily apparent than most games of this type. You are not simply given bonuses or penalties for a race with a loose archetypal flavor, but are given a sort of gameplay philosophy that establishes itself as the natural choice to adhere to, which fits with the often compelling story of the race's origin. Unique technology choices support this, but they often blend in as they simply replace research nodes in the existing tree. If you enjoy reading lore tooltips, Endless Space is full of them. Other than in battle sequences and in diplomacy, you may not get much else differentiating the races than tooltips and relevant playstyle.  The hero system is engaging, but not quite as fun as one would perhaps hope it to be, since other than unlocking unique tactical card choices in combat, their uses only amount to stat bonuses, which are traded around like any other resource. Their leveling options quickly become old hat. Clearly this was not a strong focus in the game's design as much as it was a meeting of contemporary standards.  The interface is practically a marvel of elegance. I can hardly remember a time I was searching for any piece of information I needed, which can be credited to the design choice of keeping as few primary variables as is necessary.  Galactic Civilizations II is probably the richer, more complex version of Endless Space, but Endless Space has a natural simplicity and polish that makes for a fun and balanced game without significant investment in learning curve or playtime. Most importantly, Endless Space succeeds in the illusion of exploring and colonizing a galaxy of hidden wonders, while vying for your race's idea of supremacy.",

There are only three ship weapons (with upgraded versions). Ships are pretty, but you don't get to control space combat other than selecting a tactic. Different races are provided, but you don't feel their uniqueness or character much. It's also not buggy, though I shouldn't have to mention that.",

            "review_text": "Endless Space is a fantastic addition to the 4X genre, if only because it is so unlike most 4X games. It is not a Civ/GalCiv/Pandora-style game. It is not a grand strategy game. It is not a SoSE/StarDrive/StarRuler-style game.  ES has all of the traits of a 4X game; it just does them somewhat differently. The game *feels* more abstract--probably due to its interesting art style, which feels minimalistic until you zoom in on a planet or combat scene, or zoom out on the galaxy--but it's got all of the micromanagement that 4X players love. It has a complex, multi-pathed research system, divided into four categories: military, science/tech, socioeconomy, and colonization/terraforming. Trading is not something that comes standard: you've got to do research to enable trade, build structures to make it profitable. Giant list of structures: check. Terraforming to maximize particular resources: check. Luxuries and production resources: check.  The game has a particularly interesting unit creation system, though again, not in the typical sense, but it's closest to Pandora: you've got a limited amount of hull types, which you can then customize for a particular role. Given the incremental changes in certain weapon systems--like GalCiv, it's got the three 'mass drivers/kinetics, beam, missile' weapon selection with associated defensive systems--and the selection of other ship modules (e.g. engine buffs, weapon buffs, invasion modules, colony modules, fighter/bomber hangars), you really can make a large variety of ships.  However: the combat system is given additional dimension by the 5-round combat turn, the card system, and the hero system. Each combat comprises 5 rounds: prep, long range, medium range, short/'melee' range, and resolution. Each of the 'range' rounds comprises three sub-rounds, during which weapons may be fired. Each weapon system can be customized to be a particular 'range': long, medium, or short. During each range round, weapons of that range have the highest chance to hit (90%), while weapons not of that range have reduced chance to hit. But long range weapon systems are more expensive and take up more room on your ship. Do you outfit a ship with long weapons and hope to kill your opponent in the first round of combat? Or load up with defenses and cheaper, smaller short range weapons, aiming to survive until the last rounds of combat? In vanilla ES, each weapon system has a specific range (e.g. missiles were the long weapons), but now you can customize those ranges--if your opponent favors shields and point defenses, and you've got a hero who has a long-range hero ability, load up on long range kinetics.  The card system allows you to assign a particular type of action to your fleet during each combat range round. There are five types of action cards: offense, defense, engineering, sabotage, and tactics. Each card directly counters  another type of action card; your goal is to choose action cards that benefit you, whilst trying to guess what classification of action card your opponent will choose--if one player's card counters the other, not only are the countered card's effects voided, but the counterer gains an additional bonus. (Don't worry: the countered fleet still gets to fire their weapons.) Example: I want to survive until the medium range round, and my opponent has long-range  missiles, during the long round I choose ECM (Sabotage): -25% missile damage (Counters Offense -15%). If my opponent tries to play an Offense card, not only is it countered, but now I take 40% less missile damage that round.  Bonus: Sometimes both players' cards can be countered!  The hero system is not necessarily new to 4X games, though seeing it in a sci-fi setting was new to me when I first started playing ES a couple years ago. Each hero has a pair of classes of five: Administrator, Corporate, Admiral, Pilot, Adventurer. Each class allows a hero to select from various abilities upon level up, the first two classes particularly suited to system-management, the next pair for fleet combat, the last as a catch-all category. It's otherwise pretty straight-forward: hire heroes when you're able, level them up, use them to make an otherwise untenable system stable, or to counter an otherwise much larger fleet.  Because each star system can only be accessed using travel lanes (e.g. SoSE), ES might initially seem somewhat linear, but eventually you gain access to warp drive, and the limits are gone! The one hard limit you have: you can't touch down onto planets. System invasion is another abstractualization: even 'system invasion modules' only give you a chance to instantly take over a system. Given this lack of functionality, however, it doesn't necessarily feel like the game misses out on ground combat, any moreso than we miss it in GalCiv--the two systems are, truly, just about the same mechanistically.  If you're a fan of 4X games, you already own ES. If you're looking for some way into the genre, ES does a pretty good job of not making things too cumbersome. I wholeheartedly support this game!",

            "review_text": "I have always been on the lookout for a good space strategy game. The previous winner for this category that a few friends and I would play a lot was Sins of a Solar Empire. If that game was say, a 6/10 on the space strategy scale, I'd have to put this at 9.5/10 at least. If you were a fan of Sins, you gotta check this game out.  At first I was a little hesitant to get it when it was on sale for $9.99 because one of the buddies who I played Sins with already had it and said it was rather boring. I checked out other reviews from critics and players and decided to give it a shot. Best decision I could have made. I talked my buddy into playing a game with me just to give it another chance. Half way through our first game, he admits he had misunderstood this game and that it was significantly better than he'd given it credit for.  I've heard people compare this game to Civ V in space, and I actually have to agree with them. Before playing Civ V, I hated turn based strategy games. I was an Age of Empires fan down to the core and any game like that. Civ V changed my opinion on that and opened the door for more turn based games. This game is turn based and is actually extremely similar to Civ V with gameplay and mechanics.  The game may seem a bit overwhelming at first, but in my opinion, that's a good thing. I'd much rather play a game that takes a half hour to an hour to learn over a game that dumbs it all down for you anyday. Alright, enough of my opinion, I'll give you an idea of the mechanics now so you can decide if this game is truly all I'm making it out to be.   Before you even start the game, you have several options to set in the lobby. You can change the size and shape of the galaxy, number of players, age of the galaxy ( similar to Civ V's world age option ), your faction, roughly how many star systems will be in, how far apart, difficulty, gamespeed, and whether you want the game to be private, private multiplayer, or public multiplayer. There are a few more options, but they're not as important.  Press start game and you're on your way to galactic domination. Once in game, you are provided with a very useful tutorial. The tutorial in this game is especially well done because it doesn't spring it all on you at once. Instead, it slowly walks through each part as you come to it. It won't talk about diplomacy on turn one because there's no need for it and it will only add a bit of confusion. Instead they have it so that when you click on one of the 5 tabs that display information - Empire Overview, Research Overview, Fleet Overview, Diplomatic Overview, and Hero Overview.  Each turn can take a little bit of time. Usually they're medium slow in the beginning because you have to set everything up for the first time. Early to mid game things speed up because you're waiting for research to get done and exploring which isn't a big time consumer. Mid game to early late game things tend to slow down a lot. In my experience, after I have a stable empire foundation, I'm ready to expand. This can vary based on your faction because some factions expand like crazy as soon as possible, but I usually pick a more casual and slower expanding faction. There is an empire approval meter that you have to watch out for. It's not hard to keep it very high, however, it can also easly slip if you're not paying attention. Towards the end things pick up again as you wrap things up.   One thing to note is exactly what a star system is. Essentially, they're just pre-built Civ V cities. You go in, colonize one planet in the system, and then build things in that system. There are things to build that act exactly alike a granery, library, workshop, etc from Civ V. Each system has it's own income, production, science, approval, and food. You also build fleets out of systems. You have to take the time to stop building improvements in a system and build a military unit instead - just like Civ. You can also use the money in the game ( which is Dust ) to buy upgrades to have them built in 1 turn rather than waiting 2, 10, or even 20 turns for them. This is extremely useful when you have a new system that has next to no production and would take forever to get it started.  One of the coolest features that I've found to be incredibly useful is the management system in the Empire Overview. Specifically, you have the ability to tell the computer that you want it to take over control of a system. You can tell it what you want it to focus on, be it food, science, approval, diplomacy, balanced, whatever. You can set it, change it, and remove it with 2 clicks at any time you choose. If you have a large empire of even just 15+ systems, this is invaluable as it keeps everything in order for you. Even when you let the AI govern it, you can still go in a tweak the build order or rush something important when ever you need. This was made in such a way that it is 100% useful and 0% restrictive or in the way.  Another note about star systems is that you will fine strategic and luxury resources ( very similar to Civ V ) within star systems. They are clearly marked on a very simple gui. Strategic resources appear as purple while luxury are white. You cannot access them for your empire until have have researched sufficient technology. They also offer bonuses if you can get a monopoly on them ( which simply means have access to 3 for the normal game I believe, or 4 for Disharmony ). They're not totally game changing, but they can be nice, for example, +20% approval across your empire.   Similar to Civ V, there are numerous roads to victory. To me, this is one of the biggest selling points - that you don't always have to bash everyone else's face in to win the game. I'm a big fan of the science focused faction because I prefer building my own empire over destroying other empires. The different roads to victory are as follows: Score, Supremacy, Wonder, Expansion, Diplomatic, Scientific, and Economic. You can play the game your way! As I've mentioned before, I usually prefer to achieve scientific victory because I enjoy have a technological advantage over my opponents as opposed to numbers.   Other things worth mentioning include the hero system. Can hire heroes that have different attributes. They come with 2 specialties to them ( administration, corporate, pilot, commander, spy, etc ) and you either assign them to govern a star system or as an admiral in a fleet. Where ever you put them, they always have very positive effects. The diplomacy system is great when dealing with other people because once you research it, you will have the ability to trade money ( flat or per turn ), research, star systems, and luxury or strategic resources.   As for complaints, my only one thus far would be AI logic when dealing with diplomacy. Unfortunately, if you try to make deals with them, even something as little as offer peace, they tend to demand all of your strategic resources to even consider it. This is a common problem I've seen in many games, including Civ V. Deals have to be unbelievably skewed in the bot's favor for them to accept it as 'fair'. However, if you wait long enough, they will often propose a deal to you which is in your favor ( such as offer peace and give you a luxury resource ).   Overall, I'd say this game is definitely worth $30. The average game length is comparable to a Civ V game so expect to spread it out over multiple days. Not counting sales, Civ V Gold costs $49.99. If you get your money's worth from Civ V, you'll definitely get the same value from this game. As for space based strategy games, I've never seen one do what this game does.",

One thing worth noting is that the screenshots with all of the space battles are all cinematics, you aren't actually controlling anything when that is on the screen. Battles have three phases where you pick an action to perform and the you can watch a cinematic to see how it plays out. Overall I played about 20 hours before I got bored/frustrated with the mechanics. I found that the macro game got quite tedious and there were a few things which I would have liked to see automated -streaming battleships from a star system to the battlezone (basically infinite construction of a specific ship type and have them move to a specific point after being created) -automate battles: when I had a lot of fleets 10-20 and each turn had roughly that many battles it was tedious to select battle cards for all phases (leaving them blank puts you at a big disadvantage). It would have been great to see an AI for fleets similar to what happened for systems  I would recommend this for people that like Risk, or the Galactic Conquest campaign in Star Wars Battlefront (although it lacks the high-intensity action of the actual battles).",

            "review_text": "First off, I had this gamer before, an older version from the previous year and it was really good; 100+ hours out of it easily.  (Below is a bug complaint that broke the game, but as mentioned at the end of my rant, it's now fixed!)  However, picked up the 'Emperor' edition on the steam sale, and well....it's broken. The Ai is stumped and no longer build fleets, they build one odd scout, and this is 100 turns in on hard +.  I'm not the only one who suffers this, and many have had this issue. If you want a game where you stomp the competition due to game breaking bugs, here's you're ideal game.  Apparently the Disharmony DLC fixes this, as it seems the Devs didn't care to fix the other version at all, and yet still sell it.  I got hold of this also in the sale, and yes it does fix the problem, BUT if you're going to buy this game, do yourself a favour and buy the Gold Edition with it all so you dont get stinted out of your coin. £7.99 isn't worth it just for the extra faction and the jumbled tech tree they get.  Other than that, this game would get a YES from me for recommendation, just sad that such a great, in depth 4x strategy game suffers at the hands on uncaring Devs it seems. If they ever fix the broken Emperor edition, I'll gladly change this review...until then though...   **EDIT!**  THEY FIXED IT! I had previously opened up a discussion about the ai tard-ness, and not soon after one of the devs commented about a hotfix. Few weeks later, the game was updated and people have happily reported the issue is fixed.",

There are a lot of stuff to buy to improve the planets and pelnty of technologies to discover. The tech tree doesn't feel like it was filled just to be full, all the tech have their use. And different races have slightly different tech trees.   Ships can be customized, but some other games have more options.   The main flaw would be: -Dumb an erratic AI: declare war and make peace without motive.",
