            "review_text": "This game is on to something fantastic. All the base concepts and ideas of it are rock solid, new, and refreshing. But for all the fresh and fantastic ideas, the game falls short in execution.   [GAME BASIS] You own a train in a world plagued by a hellish fog that causes peoples nightmares to become deadly reality. You are chugging your way from place to place finding survivors and trying to reach a final destination point. You are in the engine room of the train, and have outfitted it to be perfectly immune to the fog and the hellish things that come out of it. Sensibly, you never leave your room.  You are tasked with a number of duties. You are the god of this little salvation train, and as such, call absolutely all of the shots. You need fuel to keep it running, food for all the passengers, and upgrades to the train to make it more efficient and well defended from attacks. All of these things require supplies. And you certainly aren't going out there to retrieve them. Your passengers are. You decide who goes out, and you decide how they approach their smash and grab tactics of looting places of everything useful before the pseudo-sentient fog gets too thick and swallows them up. In addition to this, the game has a reasonably in depth citizen management element. Your passengers will form cliques and factions with other likeminded passengers, and you need to keep them happy enough that they don't come smash through the door of your cabin and kill you. On the other hand, you could be such a benevolent and skillfull leader that they start more or less worshipping you, and will outright murder other passengers that don't share their fanatical devotion to you.   [THE PROBLEMS] Where the game falls short is a simple lack of involvement and lack of true choices. Most 'days' in game feel exactly the same as the one before, and very dull. You direct passengers on what to upgrade, and then go to sleep and see if the ship gets attacked. If it does, you do absolutely nothing about it. It's just a matter of how many defenses against that type of attack you have constructed in the past that factors in to the results. You wake up, read the report on how the attack went, and repeat the same steps. choose upgrades. Go to sleep and see if you are attacked.  You do plot the course of the train on a map though. And make informed decissions based on things you're hearing over the radio. However, you rarely have much in the way of any real choice. A track is a straight line, so you only really have two ways to go. And back tracking is virtually never worth it, as the fog is always worse behind you, your fuel is limited, and you've probably sacked the locations behind you already. So you go forwards. The tracks branch here and there, but even if you make an effort to upgrade your radio heavily to improve your intel on the map, your choices are still pretty much nill. At any given branch, it's almost always a dead obvious choice. One route is clearly superior to the other. Even if by some miracle, the options are almost equal in details, the obvious route is the shorter one, since your fuel is a limited commodity.  The most interactive and intriguing part of the game is the loot and rescue operations you perform at stops. You direct your team of 5 passengers that you hand picked yourself, based on their skills at smashing and grabbing, on whether to be a guard or a looter. and on the floorplan of the building you mysteriously have on hand, you direct them where to go guard or loot. You have estimated amounts of time it will take them to do it. And you know how long you have before the fog rolls in and starts eating people (you got a degree in engineering AND occult weather phenomena apparently). So there's some risk/reward here, where you can choose to really push those time estimations tight for longer looting time, or make a clean safe run where they have a good bit of breathing room, but possibly less loot. There's definitely some thought to go in to this. It's almost overwhelming your first time, though that is largely due to an obnoxious UI. But like the rest of the game, it quickly becomes extremely obvious. And this is largely due to lack of details and lack of involvement. All you know is the layout of the building, the names of the rooms (kitchen, bathroom, storeroom, etc.), and how long it will take when you send person X to do their job. Generally what you will find in a room is obvious where applicable, like a kitchen containing food. But the vast majority of rooms are basically a piniata you whack at and see what comes out. Storeroom of a bank? Ok? Bathrooms? Lounges? who knows what you'll turn up from those places. The worst oversight of the game, in my opinion, is that once you finish planning and begin the operation, you are nothing but a spectator. You watch on your radar as your team moves in and does their jobs, and they radio updates in to you in real time, letting you know if they find things, survivors, etc. But you yourself do nothing at all. Unexpected issues basically don't exist. Occasionally 'The Fearless' will be on the map and wander it trying to attack your team. But ultimately, there is no point watching any of it. Because you can't do anything. Despite the radio beside you, you can't call out a change of plan. You can't call Billy back and tell him to abort because there's a fearless wandering right in to his room. Billy just stays in there and loots mindlessly until eaten. And you just sit and watch on your radar like a sick weirdo.   This part of the game was really its chance to shine. But it falls short. This was a chance to get some solid gameplay in that had actual decission making that wasn't obvious. You shouldn't know everything about these buildings that you do. And at the same time, you should get more details as the operation proceeds. If it was a bit more like a RTS mini game, where you are revealing more of the map as you direct your team through the building, searching for useful items, telling them how to attack things if they are a threat, etc. it would be extremely cool. But as implemented, it's a pretty dull experience after your first couple missions.  The citizen management aspect is equally lacking. They did a great job with the presentation of your passengers, having a sizeable random pool of photos, a good random name generator, and important statstical and idealogical differences between them that will make you want to remember their names and faces when making decissions. Each carriage even elects a leader, and the leader can impact the mindset of the others in the cabin. It's really neat. But that great presentation only really makes it more disapointing that you have so little involvement or interaction with any of them. You can't discuss anything with anyone. Choices over social issues do exist, but I've only seen one in a lets play video. I've only played 5 hours, but thats 5 hours with NEVER encountering one of those choices. It would almost be better if they hadn't put so much effort in to making your passengers feel so individualized. It's like dangling a carrot in front of you that you can never actually get.  [CONCLUSION] 5/10. Fantastic ideas. Truly fantastic. But every last one of them felt woefully shallow in developement. If these ideas were developed more deeply, and the player had more involvement and more interesting decissions to make, this game would be something very special. But alas, I can't recommend it.
