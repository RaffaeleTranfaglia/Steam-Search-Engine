Italia'78 with all the political turnmoil, society changing rusty paradigm and search for new ways. Issues of freedom of all kind, women liberation, religion and strong far-left faction on the scene, we have all of this mixed up here.  If all mentioned above didn't intrigue you, or you never heard of Nanni Moretti, Pasolini or Aldo Moro, then this game probably isn't for you. Simple as that.",

            "review_text": "What a wonderful, weird experience. Cruise along the Mediterranean with two girls locked in conversation listening to italodisco on the radio. There isn't really any driving. It's a branching dialog game. Conversations with each other, conversations with hitchhikers, intentional silence. Doesn't hurt that it looks gorgeous and has a groovy original soundtrack, either.",
