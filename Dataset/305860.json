            "review_text": "Recommended!  As long as you accept an automated tool cannot churn out 100% perfect results this is a great tool for the price.   A little post-production editing is necessary in some cases to get “great” results but it’s out of the box results have mostly worked for me without needing it. They are certainly better than I could do by hand in an acceptable timeframe.  The UI is unconventional and a little tricky to understand at first. The tool is clearly implemented in Unity so I actually think the author has done a pretty good job! The UI shown in the steam video is old and a lot seems to have changed since then although the general layout and style remain the same.  A couple of minutes experimenting will get you where you need to be as far as the UI and its options go. Make sure you click on the cog icon to enable the advanced configuration mode. The advanced settings go a long way to fixing some of the visual issues that can appear when only the basic settings are used.   It would be great if the author put together some “from scratch” video tutorials showing how to make different types of tile sets from scratch (including making the base textures) to demonstrate how to use each of the settings for the best results and also explain what needs to be kept in mind when producing the base textures for the tools input. It doesn’t seem to play well with transparency in the base textures for example.  If you are more of a programmer than an artist this tool can save you valuable time and make what was a long winded, dull and painful process relatively quick and easy. Given the price I would certainly recommend it even if you only use it to generate a starting point or prototype tiles.  So far I have produced decent looking tiles at 16*16, 32*32 and 64*64. I don’t know how it works with higher resolutions.",

            "review_text": "I want to like this but I just can't. It's a fantastic idea, and could potentially save people a long time on atleast setting up there tiles. But I'm not going to recommend this to anyone.  Firstly, why use this odd custom window/layout type graphic. I don't see it in any other Pixel related software and that's a good thing. It hasn't made it look any better than the normal windows do so why have it? In the end it just makes it harder to use because nothing is familiar. It looks cheap, like the type of computer software that would come with a family camera. I take one look at it and become exhausted.  Secondly $25 for an auto tiler? It's not even very good pixel art software in the first place, Most people would be better off making the art in Photoshop or GraphicsGale then exporting it to this because nobody is going to be making their art on it. Not to mention GraphicsGale is $5 cheaper.  And lastly, I can imagine that once you're done with your tileset you will be exporting it back into your pixelart software because the tiles you end up will never be perfect. When you have some magic software doing all the work for you it will show, so you will most likely need to do some touchups in the end.  If you are serious about making games you won't use this, maybe for prototyping (if you can be bothered with the weird layout and graphics they have used) but you will always be better off making the art yourself by hand. and not for $25.  'Tileset Maker version 2.0' is free and has a few features that will help you out with the tiling process.",
