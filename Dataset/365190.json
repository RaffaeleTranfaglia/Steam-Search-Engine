I tried to enjoy but it just didn't suit me.",

            "review_text": "In short, the game is good. Could use some polishing but not bad.  In the amount of time I have played Tastee. It is a well rounded point to point, tower defense turn based game. There are some flaws though. One, you can barely find multiplayer games. Two, the game feel jagged and not smooth like butter. I reccomend other turn based and strategy games if you want something like this.   I dont understand though how a team of 50 odd people can be called a Indie team, but i'm not complaining.  If you want a strategy and turn based game. Look at other games this one isnt right and doesnt play right. So hold on to your hard earned 17 dollars, and look somewhere else.  Verdict:  25/100",
