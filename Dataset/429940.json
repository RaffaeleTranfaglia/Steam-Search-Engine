            "review_text": "Masterpiece ღ  ! Don't read if you don't like spoilers !  It has been a really long time since I've read such a great visual novel. I'm usually not into free games since there isn't much work on them and they have really poor stories , drawing style etc but this one got my attention by just randomly seeing it. First i had doubts i mean the drawing looked so good , really girlish design but then i was wondering about the content in this game if it was satisfying enough. Well why not giving it a try? After i downloaded it and started it i already fell in love with the beautiful main menu ! Those soft girlish pastel colours , style of drawing...top top top!   When the game started i was feeling like im reading a story about myself..a life story to be honest. The main Heroine in this game ( Toma ) is really in a lot of ways like me even tho its just a game..i couldn't believe how this is similar to me like i was talking to the creator of this game and he made a game out of me with a few changes . Since i had the similar thing as Toma with the name chosen by her mother which wasn't supposed to be Toma but Amelia, i remembered how my mother told me something long long time ago.   It feels really creepy if you play a game and its like you can look into a mirror ..see yourself . The more i was reading, i could replace myself with Toma .. being different then others seems really annoying and you want to change yourself etc i guess its just us people in this world who can't be happy with what we are or what we have. I guess another reason why i got attached to this game is that im interested in History,Victorian history..just old things that not everyone cares to talk about or do researches and this game has this ' old ' style. I love how this game is made so realistic and it has a rich story which i didn't read for a long time as mentioned.  Well the game is not really long and you can finish it between 1-2 hours but i personally didn't feel like to just read fast and see what happens. The story made me feel like im experiencing it in real life and i wanted to understand or better to say ' feel ' the story. Since im a sensitive person, to be honest i cried a few times while reading .. wonderful music , art , in game atmosphere. Maybe im hyping it to much but i think this game deserves to become a Movie. I would even pay money for the game because in my opinion it shouldn't be a free game its way better than just a free game actually .  After finishing it i got the strength to love myself the way i am even more and appreciate it . I learned that being the unique ' yourself' is better than wanting being someone different and that every single person has their own story . We live for reasons and out of each single person there will be some day a different story..beautiful story, happy story , sad story etc . This is a 'game' with quality after all it teaches the person who is playing it something really valuable which you don't see in other games . Another thing which you can learn is that a game doesn't need to be famous or hyped to have quality.  At all i highly really highly recommend it ! For me its one of my favorite games till now . I think you really should try it out ! Don't read the story fast and try to focus on the speech of the characters im sure you will experience the game different then just fast clicking it away.   Merci for reading  Stay true to yourself ღ",

The characters express a sort of Carpe Diem message which I feel is relevant to the VN audience. Too many of us suffer from some sort of depression, anxiety, or other social disorders. I myself suffer from social anxiety and it's one of the many factors that influenced my initial delving into the VN world. The characters are relatable, the references are witty and well thought out. It was a wonderful experience. Hope the creators keep up their work. It's nice to see a Visual Novel that's more than smut and that additionally explores the realms this one does. Love and Caring is beautiful, regardless of gender. Anyways, now that I've rambled enough in my review. I conclude.",
