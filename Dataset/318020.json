I haven't had this much fun playing an online RTS since the days of Zero Hour.  Know that this is a true: build, resource, produce, tech, fight RTS game in the vein of command and conquer without any: micro transactions, NO offline progression system, no unfair unlocks, no BS at all. Just hop on, start on a level playing field and have a blast rolling your tanks over your opponent",

            "review_text": "This is the first time I ever felt the need to write a review on steam. At the moment I played Act of Aggression for about 63 hours and I had a BLAST!  Here is why:  - I LOVE to play together with friends against AI. Sometimes I'm just to tired to get into a game against humans and all I want is to play a few rounds with friends. This game delivers exactly that. - I really enjoy the way this game approaches it's take on RTS. The resource mechanic feels challanging but not unfair (a few matches forced me to expand more than I wanted because the #%$! rare earth was quite a bit away from my base. I like the prisoner mechanic, sure, you need a some micro management for that but the reward for that effort is worth it. The airstrikes feel like skillshots from MOBAs (which I also enjoy) and added a rewarding gameplay mechanic (shooting hostile bombers down RIGHT before your base just makes my day!). - One of my favorite RTS games is Supreme Commander, always loved it's complexity. I was really disappointed when Supreme Commander 2 was kinda 'dumbed down' to be more accessible. Still enjoyed the game. Act of Aggression feels like it didn't went for those compromises (sure, they certainly made some) and I can dig in stats and rich unit diversity. - Reliable netcode: This one is easy. I never finished a multiplayer game C&amp;C Generals with the infantry general. Ever. When i picked up C&amp;C 3 about 1/5 multipalyer games disconnected because of the netcode (I played friends, we used voice chat, so there were no issues on provider side). This shouldn't be a plus, it should be a given for every game that has multiplayer. Shame it isn't.  I am honestly surprised about how many negative reviews there are. Maybe others expected something different from this game. I did not. It delivered what I felt it promiesd. Sure, the singleplayer lacks cutscenes. And balancing needs some tweaking (I mostly play Chimera). I can live with that.  So, in a nutshell: I am 33, my first RTS was Dune, played all kinds of RTS, even the weird ones like War Wind and I can recommend this game without a doubt. Is it perfect? Well, obviously not. Still a bloody fun game.",

In the mean time i searched Steam for the solution: the program cannot run fullscreen, only windowed. Problem is you can't change that when you have started the game because you have to create an account at Eugen Systems before you can even change graphics :-(  Then you have to copy the cd-code, which did not work from the Steam overlay, so i had to type it manually in Wordpad and put it on my second screen. Doing that AoA already crashed and locked op my computer. When i finally managed to enter it, the visuals were so poor, i decided after half an hour of gameplay that this is not my kinda game.",

It's another game that revolved around clicking fast and exploiting gimmicks.

            "review_text": "The developers took what could have been a good idea and simply massacred it by making it, to put it simply; very bland and very boring. To think that this is the same developer that brought us the amazingly scoped 'Wargame'... and for them to create this even more of a drab version of gaming porridge, that has little to no sweet aspect to it...? By porridge, I mean that this game is just bland, boring and thick with things that you have to do in order to try to have actual fun with the game... you have to mentally chew your way through the game rather than being excited about what tech you're going to get next, or what buildings and units are going to be available to you within the next 5 minutes. Rather than being able to mentally streamline the experience with knowing where things are on the map after a few or so games, they've given you loads of pointless map clutter that serves absolutely no purpose and 3 randomised resources which can simply ♥♥♥♥ up your entire experience - all of those hours of the RTS skill you've attained over the years are thrown out of the window due to, guess what? A randomisation mechanic within the resources... and on top of that, there's way too much tech and units for you to ever experience everything within a single game like every other RTS allows you to do. If it's not the resources running out, it's the randomised resource points not giving you enough, or it's the resources not giving you enough in general to get past DEFCON 2. The tech and unit options are convoluted and each faction ends up being a complete cobweb like mess that you have to figure out but, it's the type of figuring out that will give you a migraine rather than a mental boner due to being intellectually challenged. On top of that; each faction isn't really all that different. There is no real character to any of the factions, units or anything else in the game - again, it's bland, boring and quite forgettable. It takes itself way too seriously to be actually fun... you know? A 'game' is meant to be created for others to play so that they can have 'fun'. If you are wanting an RTS game for multiplayer then this isn't it. You'll probably play a few matches and you'll forget what actually happened due to how much of a 'rat race' it is. It literally feels like a 9am to 5pm day job when playing this game - rather than an escape into a world of explosions and badassery... Base building is quite possibly the most boring aspect of the game due to it keeping you confined to a stupid grid system rather than being able to build a base and angle the buildings so that it has some sort of 'life' and believability to it - not 'realism' but, believability - it's not your base, it's the grid and game's base. Why can't I angle my buildings so that I can create interesting layouts? Why can't I build my barracks across a road when there's nothing else that's going to be using that piece of road? It's the decisions like this that hold the game back from being successful. Woe be to the person who tells the developers their opinion on the game or else you just get called a troll, and then banned - I've seen that happen to many people. Don't even get me started on the lack of control scheme options - if that's anything to go by then you should avoid this game like the plague because not only does it take the genre back to 'the golden age of RTS', but, it takes it back to 'the golden age of RTS' in terms of all the bad things are more so than the good things. Don't buy this game just because of that reason alone. It's obvious that the developers stayed in their little ignorant bubble trying way too hard to be unique but ended up turning what could have been one of the best C&amp;C clones ever made. They didn't do ANY research into as to how RTS games that have been refined through other studios successes and mishaps within the very genre it's trying to tackle, nor did they even research into genres like the isometric MOBA games that have blown the gaming world wide open due to how custimisable they are, which has essentially made them take over the RTS genre. Where customisable options for the player is key to make the experience more fluent are a godsend, welcomed with open arms by players who want a clean experience within their strategy game, 'Act of Aggression' fails, and fails hard. People compare this game to 'C&amp;C: Generals'? Those people need to get real. 'Generals' had, and still has, commercial freighter loads more character and overall colour than this game will ever have. If you're going to play any RTS games by Eugen, then play 'Act of War: Direct Action', any of the 'Wargame' releases or just don't bother and just buy something like the 'Dawn of War' collection and have fun with the mods that are out there. Again, I'll compare this game to porridge; it's bland and boring - avoid it completely if you have gaming taste buds. I'll give you my opinion on the graphics; there's way too much clutter and things going on to actually truly 'see' anything that's special. When you see so many explosions within a game just from units blowing up in ridiculous ways, it makes the bigger explosions of things like super weapons not seem as grand, you know? The graphics just end up becoming a messy affair and seem to be a 'means to an end' because they've tried to realistically scale it - which completely fails in an RTS game and devoids the entire game of any sort of character or life. Look at every single successful RTS game out there that's memorable, and that's been successful - they've all been on a disproportioned scale so that you can visually enjoy what the art department has created for you, the gamer! This isn't the case with 'Act of Aggression'! They've made it an absolute chore to try and enjoy the details that they created! It makes no sense! Come to think of it... the entire package just... makes no sense... there's literally no creative direction behind a VIDEO GAME here. If you're going to go with realistic or believable scaling then create a 1st person, or 3rd person game - don't do it within an RTS... of all genres to pick?! If you're going to buy this game, then buy it after the game has been fixed for usability and don't pay any more than £15 because it completely fails to carry the hype torch that the creative director made it out to be able to carry. My final words to you are the following; there is no 'game' here... it's just a lot of chores followed by a visually lifeless mess... there's just no fun to be had here. My overall rating for 'Act of Aggression' is; 3/10  p.s. To also think that an RTS game in 2015 had a beta and nothing got improved upon with the ability to remap your mouse and entire keyboard? Now that is insane and proves that this game had no creative direction what-so-ever.",

The game is in desperate need to strong, reliable, anti-air strategy.   In the last 10-20 games I have played I was strictly playing against aircrafts whatever faction I play against.    If you are US, you just spam aircrafts with oil (which you can generate) and there is no defense/veichcle/aircraft/infantry unit that can destroy your 70-100 aircrafts. Or you build a couple of bombers which are sufficient to destroy his whole base, even the HQ needs just 2 bombers where super weapons need 3.  If you are Chimera, you can also just spam airports and send your aircrafts which keep on going until if reaches your base and that can send missles that seek your anti air specifically from distance to destroy them.  If you are Cartel, the super speedy bomber travels faster than missles can even follow them sometimes.  If both sides of the map build aircrafts, whoever built more will win the game, other units dont matter.  There is no reliable counter play at all. Anti-Superweapons which cost rare earth and which are extemely scarce barely do anything where if you build/ 100 of them, all of them will shoot at one aircraft at a time, extremely ineffecient and needs redesign.   I have played over 150 hours of this game and I really did enjoy it, but nowadays its either play all around aircrafts or just get destroyed.  ",

            "review_text": "This review is to evaluate the Reboot edition of this game, which is basically a free add-on that changes the game, for me, to it's entirety. AOA in it's original format (With it's 3 resources) bored me to hell, as i found myself worrying too much about first scanning for resources, then getting my little builder trucks over to the fields safely, then to defend an outpost in the middle of the map - All to find that the entire time my AI enemy has already founded it's army and.. well.. gg. So, the reboot edition deserves praise, now the dev's have re-designed the resource system. It's far less micro-management and really allows me to focus on building my base and army, just like the good old days with C&amp;C Generals! To me, this game is a new version of C&amp;C. I love the units, the graphics, the upgrades, the various tactics..  However - If i may throw my cards on the table, there's a few things i would suggest needs improving.  Firstly. the maps. I play alot of online games and i must say, i've played the same 2 maps for the past two weeks and it's becoming incredibly tedious. More maps must be a priority!  The last thing is more a personal groan but i feel the games don't tend to last half as long as they used to (Win or Lose) back with my other beloved C&amp;C games. With AOA, it usually ends the game after the first rush from Chimera faction, as US are totally useless on defence. Maybe it's more that i suck at the game, but i feel the factions might be slightly unbalanced?   Anyway, awesome game - If you liked C&amp;C, get this game (only for the free Reboot Edition though!)  Thanks Eugen Systems, for taking time to tweak this awesome title.",

So even though people said this game was bad I didn't listen and dropped $30 on this peice. I was extremely disapointed and I wanted to get a refund for my wasted time and money, but I had played for 6 hours trying each faction and honestly that was all I was going to get out of it. I pleaded steam for a refund and wrote a whole paragraph, desperate to go buy a better game or some payday DLC. But, they rejected my plea and I am stuck with this garabage game.   3 reasons why not to get Act of Agession-  1.There is NOOOOO campain, they use old newsreels instead of any real backstory. 2.The gameplay is complicated with too much small infantry and vehicle tweaks that you WILL NOT have time for, so I often just tried to spam all the things. 3.They took away everything good about RUSE (not including the ruses), such as the smooth gameplay that combines commanding and building seemlessly.

As of me writing this [11/29/2015] it is on the steam explorer sale for 26.99 at this price I say its a good buy, however as mentioned it feels like it lacks in certain areas (mainly the nations) I can say that I too agree with this point, everyone seems vehicle based, and once you get vehicles infantry are more of annoying flies than real threats, even in buildings since vehicles take these down way too easily.   The UN to me seems very difficult to play as they have no heavy hitters in terms of Anti-Tank this could also just be me being really really bad with this faction since the computer sometimes seems to totally kick my ♥♥♥ with them at some points.

By Andrei Pankov on September 3, 2015 I have been playing Act of Aggression now for about 3 weeks. I'm one of the lucky few to have seen the game while it was still in the beta phase. I am so happy for this game! I'm a die hard RTS fan, and I must say, there have not been any quality titles in the RTS genre in a while until now. (The only one at this time I also play is Company of Heroes 2, but it has been on the marked for a long time now). Act of aggression is wonderful in all respects. Graphics are fantastic. Units are interesting and variable in their uses. 3 factions to choose from have their own strengths and weaknesses. It's a pure joy to play this game online multiplayer or against a computer AI opponent. I have not played the single player campaign yet, as it has just been released, but I'm looking forward to doing so soon. Usually with the games like Act of Aggression the most fun is found in the multiplayer matches, best played against another human. It's so fun to play against another human being who is intelligent and able to react/adjust his strategy based on your own approach.  There have bee many RTS games over the years, and I want more to be made! I derive a lot of joy from building a base, making an army, and then attacking and seeing what happens. I do not need any innovation in what I already consider to be a great game design. I also hope there will be more DLCs coming out for this game. I already clocked more then 100 hours playing this game and I foresee myself playing it more and more in the upcoming months.",

It does not have as much love for details as World in Conflict and the campagin is rather boring and not very sophisticated. But the Multiplayer is challenging yet easy to get into. There could be more maps but in general this game is a real treat for fans of RTS games.  Short summary  The game features three fractions: US Army, Cartell (international crime organization) and Chimera (UN Task force), the three fractions are different in many ways yet good balanced (I would have prefered existing powers over fictious ones for example China and EU instead of Chimera and Cartell) but none the less they're both fun, US Army and Chimera fight the Cartell (or in the MP each other) and use three ressources to fuel their conflict money (in form of banks, PoW and oil), aluminium and rare earth. Super Weapons are included but can be countered and apparently deactivated for MP matches.   Rating  I would rate the game with 8/10 it is fun and interesting to play but the campaign is disappointing and in general some parts still look unfinished, also even though they said there won't be the possibiliy to rush it still happens.",

Multiplayer rewards spamming specific units. Not all factions have their own campaign. Nothing new added to the old formula of an RTS game.  This game had a lot of potential but fell drastically short of them all. The only place the game succeeds in is in its graphics. There are no innovations to this game. The same UI, the same buttons, the same playstyle as all the old Command and Conquer games. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the campaign is so aweful I quit playing it after the third mission was easily blown through. The missions don't challenge you at all. You don't have to do any more than simply click attack move and click on where the objective is on the minimap. On top of that, the US does not have a campaign of its own. Given the description of the US in the game's site (old, out of date) and you get the feeling that the developers actually don't like the US faction at all. All in all the game in bland, with only the graphics making it interesting for the first few minutes. There are a few 'oo ah' moments, but if you want good gameplay, go back and play Command and Conquer Generals. You'll have a better time.",

            "review_text": "Being a Big RTS fan, I was super exicted to see this game, The Real time Stragey Genre, has been extremely, lacking lately. With most people labeling Games like 'MOBAS' as Strategy games or games like Civ 5 being a RTS.   But this is the kind of Real time Strategy I have missed, base building resource farming, massive armies Upgrading your units. The only RTS ive seen on the market these days is Starcraft II  Having said all that lets move onto what I think of the game.   Gameplay wise, Its 'Alright' I eas extremely, Disapointed with the factions With Chirmea And the USA being extremely simliar, right down to the units. The Cartel Is a fun faction But again units seemed too fimliar for my liking.  Each faction didnt have that 'Unquieness' to it. Like with Command and Conquer with Nod, they seemed like Resistince fighters, using what tech they could, and infusing Tiberium into Soilders. With GDI you could tell they was the more advance, with Units like the Mammoth tank.  The 3 factions just seemed underwhelming to me, and didnt stand out, with them being far to simliar.  Now the Campaign. Without spoilers.  There is only 2 Campaigns  The Chimera One uses both Chimera units, and The USA units (which is why they seem so close, I didnt even notice the switch)  The cartel, as the smallest campaign. and is Alot more diffcult.   The campgain does have FMV movies, in the style, of old C&amp;C games, and can be alittle cheesey sometimes.   Gameplay.  This was where I was most disapointed, for a 'Base building' game is restricts, base building Massively.  2 Problems with this... Factions are lmited to a small space and have to build a 'Outpost' or there factions version to expand the contruction zone, this means spamming the battle field with outposts , to reach the resources, you so deprately need. Yes you can build your Refinery where ever resources are, but without a construction zone near it, you cant build Defences around it, or a Storage drop off point.  Second problem is the power system, Both the USA and CHimera, need power early on, which means filling up what little, construcion zones you have to begin with, with power units. The cartel dont need it till later, But theres have a chance to explode when destoried. This destorying units around it  And the other problem I had was the Actual resource Gathering. There is 3 types, Oil, Alluminiam And Rare earth. The rare Earth you have too wait till end tier, and have to upgrade in some cases to farm it. My problem is, with most factions when the resouce pile is empty, Then thats it, Some factions have way for you to gain oil, by capturing POW's but then it turns into a slow game.  Despite all this though I still would recommend it, since there is such a huge lack of RTS games in the market, Maybe wait for a price drop though, or some updates/dlc",

You're not given a whole lot of direction or information about how to use your troops, their abilities if any, and so on at the beginning of the game - you're a little bit left to figure it out on your own. It's not hard, but other RTS games have definitely done this much better.  And the voice acting, WOW. terribad. It's a great touch that the publisher added characters and acting to make the story come together, but damn, I wish they'd have called me for one of the roles, I gauran-damn-tee you I'd put the voice actors I've heard so far (the Chimera ones) to shame without so much as trying.

Limited resources (largely a personal opinion, but last I checked Red Alert and Tiberium Wars had infinite resources. That ensured hours of fun gameplay, huge armies of units, and, sometimes, grueling back and forth).   Slow unit response (and slow unit movement...). Many other people point this out. The units are sluggish. We're very much used to microing our units (SCII and COH). It's just extremely difficult to keep your crucial unit alive when it dies before it even acknowledges your command. This becomes largely frustating when you go back to the fact that there's limited resources, so a loss is a big loss, and it's all the more upsetting when the reason for their destruction is the slow response... Also, they take forever to go anywhere...  Granted, I decided to write this review after only 8 hrs of gameplay, and after defeating for the first time the Easy AI. However, it felt so...unsatisfying. I felt so unfulfilled. I finally defeated the enemy, but I did not feel I accomplished anything. I focused on farming, deploying outposts and refineries and placing turrets for protection. After successfully defending against numerous waves, when I had enough resources I just bought infantry healing APCs, filled them with exoskeleton soldiers, and destroyed the enemy base. The whole time I was frustratingly trying to farm enough resources, and that just made the whole match not fun. With games like SCII and COH, you would deploy your units to skirmish against the enemy, but in AoA every engagement is completely anti-climatic. Since micro-managment is out the window, all you do is issue attack move on the enemy and hope you have more units than them. Unit type production doesn't even matter at higher tiers, cause you can just deploy vehicles/infantry that counter EVERYTHING. Say goodbye to your units, cause my units are efficient against infantry, vehicles, and aircrafts.   My opinion may change with more gametime...at least I hope so...",

'jea killed him' 'he got served' and so on... and that repeats after 2 seconds or so. if you dont have enough soundfiles... don't play them every kill!  Story: Kinda ok. Has a good explaination why you start only with riflemen.. then light vehicles.. and so on.. you get overrun alot...   As a fan of C&amp;C i can say... this is not even close to be comparable to even the worst parts of the c&amp;c series.",

For the most part, I like and trust Eugen to make good games. Sadly, this half-baked Command &amp; Conquer Generals isn't exactly what I was hoping, nor looking for.   The only aspect of this game which I can truly praise are the graphics, but even then, aside from the cards, buildings and units look samey (probably a result of Wargame's attempt at unerring accuracy to reality.) The audio is perfunctory, the musical score poor, the gameplay unimaginative, the units seem to lag, the factions are lame, but at least the RPS style is here, and there's some variation in faction mechanics, however minor.   In truth, I haven't played it for long - just a couple of matches - and I'll persist with it. If my opinion changes, I'll amend this review, but for now, all I can say is that Act of Aggression is only for those truly desperate enough to weather a bland game.   5/10.

            "review_text": "A very good RTS game. Feels like a refreshed version of Act of War (AoW). Units and factions, occupiying buildings, taking prisoners - all things you already find in AoW. Even the factions feel like their counterparts in AoW :D  But now you got 3 ressources, which are placed randomly at the map. A far more better engine, which allows to zoom out very far.   The gameplay also has changed. Like it was in the old days, reconnaissance is very important. Even more, cuz the range of weapons, like anti tank missles, has also been increased.  The 3 ressources make it necessary for you to scout at the beginning and to establish routes by buildings placed in the right direction. In endgame you need to find your ways of getting money, e.g. by taking prisoners. Also superweapon use costs you ressource. The described ressource part is only in vanilla version. The free Reboot Edition offers you a more simply gameplay. Fixed locations of ONE ressource.  Last but not least: The A.I. It's astonishing how it can mix its units. I played a lot of games as US Army vs. the Cartel at EASY. It attacks your groud forces with the corresponding units and also takes advantage of air strikes, e.g. some jets if you defend a position just by gunships. Tested it on 3 different maps. A great competition when it comes to offline play.  Negatives: - some administration taks are overwhelming, e.g. selecting your HQ to order some buildings is getting tricky, when you added some sub HQs - you can change the key mapping, but mouse buttons are not allowed (right now) - feedback when something happens is like non-available - counter units like anti air are needed in mass to be useful e.g. an Anti Air Vehicle looses against attack choppers. Sometimes they even got outranged... - advertising should have been made more often; I just saw 200 players in the vanilla version online :O  all the contras can be fixed very easy by some patches and by marketing, from my point of view...so buy it and make it go viral! :P  But in the end, the genre reference stays Supreme Commander Forged Alliance on this plattform when it comes to RTS.",

It plays almost identically to CnC Generals and CnC Generals Zero Hour, but is significantly more advanced (the 2016 graphics are a huge plus, and there are tons of amazing hotkeys and unit task assignment shortcuts that allow a level of gameplay above that offered by CnC).  The single resource economy vastly simplifies the financial side of gameplay over the original Act of Aggression, leaving more time to focus on actual attack and defense strategies. I find games like Starcraft to be a bit too fast-paced and muscle-memory multitasking oriented, so AoA RE seems to fit me perfectly--I have enough time to think things through, but the pace is still fast enough to keep me challenged and interested.  My only beef about this game is that not enough people play it--it's often hard to find a RE online game unless I'm playing with friends. Eugen needs to dedicate more attention to updating and promoting AoA RE in order to build up the online multiplayer community. This game has an amazing amount of potential, and I'm sure that I'll be playing it for years to come.",

The game is so unbalanced and the units are so unresponsive. The mechanics of an RTS that makes it good is that theres always a good unit vs another unit, while in this game you have units like the terminator, that only costs aluminium, that can be upgraded to fight and asskick EVERYTHING and in the game.  Its so easy to just mass out as much random units as you can, and it almost always works, its just so mind numbing compared to other games when you actually have to think about what units that counters the enemies units. Also, what the **** did you think when you made the fennek? Yeah, lets make a unit that is really cheap, can outrun everything, make it really overpowered against buildings and give it stealth... holy s*** seriously? Even if you have stealth detection, if you're not inside your base with a huge army with stealth detect at all times, your base will go down so fast against fennek and also the metal storm, that you can just forget about the game if you are more than 50 meters from your HQ at any given time. And yes, the enemy will always find a way around you, and if you are supposed to have enough units and stealth detect to actually counter him, you wont be able to do anything other than turle the whole game. This is especially true in bigger MP games when you play 2on2 or more players together on bigger maps. The fast patches after launch also indicates something positive, but also negative about you releasing the game too early, and not being a finished product. I just wanted this game to be the next good oldshool'ish RTS, but It's not, It's actually a really bad game, objectively I would say, because it really really is.",
