            "review_text": "For once it's Hercules managed to get in trouble and captured twice, you need another hero... his dear and tender Megara! Roles are reversed! So instead of having a Hercules that does nothing, here's come Megara... that isn't more active than him. But she's more useful than him: she can grow plants that will give you food.  Indeed, as for the previous games, you sent your servants for resources gathering (gold, food, wood) in order to build or to expand houses, workshops, farms or gold mines that are periodically giving you... resources. But beware of the thieves that will take them if you're not fast enough! As usual, you have bonuses for stopping time, making the servants (or resources) work/walk faster, making more resources, etc... Nothing really changed from the previous games. Even Cerberus, Medusa or Pegasus are still present. There is however a new character, Charon, that can bring resources that are floating for one piece of gold.  So without real innovation, how come this game isn't boring? Because there is a challenge of beating high scores, because you want to see how the story finishes. That's the main reasons, for me at least. Indeed, the casual difficulty removes the timer and the Olympic time, so you have all the time in the world to finish the level. The normal difficulty has the timer while the higher difficulty has less time (and more points). Besides, you can unlock bonus levels by finding pieces of puzzles and reconstitue them.  Graphics are like the previous game, very colorful and nice for a casual game. The soundtrack is still the same.  If you liked the two previous games, you'll like this one. You'll like also the fact that Hercules is the one to be saved now and that thanks to Megara, you'll have food quite early in the game that will appear periodically. The challenge is still present, so, yeah, you can go ahead, the price isn't too high, you have trading cards, achievements...",

This is a gamer where a thumb in the middle would have been the best and most honest choice.",

The series in itself has been a most enjoyable experience in a style of time management gameplay that I have not seen before these game.",

            "review_text": "IMO: This is the worst one of the series. -Diffrences between the three games:  First Game: The best game of the lot. This game uses a strategy mechanism of you bulid a building and wait for the resouces to appear in your Inventory. So this means that you need to choose which building to bulid first and which path to take first as to not run out of time. Every 10th level is a mini game that breaks up the game and add a bit of fun to the game. Only thing that is missing is a casual difficulty level and developer score beat achievement.  Second Game: This game changes the resouce management to more touch based. this means you bulid a building and then your resouce ends up on a stone circle and you have to click this resouce to collect it other wise on some levels the thieves will sell your resouces. There is also added bonus levels (without achievements to play) and developer score beat achievement  Thrid Game: Basically like the second but achievement to play bonus levels. first 28 levels do not include hercules. You much now grow your berry bushes before you can harvest them. The best part IMO has been taken out 'Bonus levels' and replaced with another level the same as the rest.   Cons: Music to this series is horrible turn it off. The bell to collect the resouces can give you a headace after playing for a while. This game gets more and more like a touch based game with every release. The story is also non existence and does not continue between games   Pros: I got first one in the series for NZD:$0.85",
