The video gets extremely fuzzy off and on, the way a bad signal looked back in the day when you had an antenna, back when tvs were analog. There was even a function that was listed as the wrong button. The worst thing of all, was that the game kept thinking I was in one spot, when I was in a different spot, so it wouldn't let me do anything when I got to a certain room. If you like mediocrity, you'll love this game!",
