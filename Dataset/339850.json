The game it's self is quite good for the most part with an ok story and not too bad voice acting, that being said - it's very slow going and extremly repetative throughout, which in the end leaves you with so many unasnwered questions, makes you wonder why you just spent so much time clearing it.   if you want a good story though and don't mind the fact that it relies on repertition, then by all means give it a go - only if it's on sale though :)  ",
