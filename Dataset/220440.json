I had some money to buy some games as the Capcom publisher sale was on and I stumbled upon this and the reviews seemed decent and I was ready for a break from money sapping microtransaction bulls**t FPS games not hinting any particular ones...  I brought this game expecting another decent DmC game but I was not expecting to fall in love so much. In my opinion this game is next to formiddable. The unique style of the bosses and learning new weapons, combos and weaknessess of enemies keeps the ball rolling. Oddly I found myself quite invested in the characters too. You have a new style for Dante which somehow I have come to adore and a string of likeable and dislikeable characters all for good reasons. Nice refreshing fast paced combat tied in with discovering new foes and being told a fantastic origin story of the protagonist. I must say the Second level is slightly repetitive and if you find yourself buying this game and find that too; give it another chance and it WILL win you over.   I find it hard to tell whether I love the story more, the combat, the bosses or the characters. This game is a must-buy if you have played any combat games and want a challenging yet story-gripping, single-player experience. Amazing game. Proof that Capcom still have what it takes to win us over. Good Job Capcom.",

            "review_text": "This is my first time playing a Devil May Cry game, with this being what introduced me to the series. Having never played any of the previous games in the series, all I knew was this being a hack and slash game and that it was a reboot of the series. I know this game received a lot of hate when it was initially released, because of it being a reboot, having a brand new Dante, and that sort of stuff. My review can't really speak on that as I haven't played any of the other games in the series. So my review will be based solely on this game itself and my experience with it. That said, I can definitely say I really enjoyed this game and had a lot of fun with it. The soundtrack is a pretty wild one, with some crazy music, but it definitely suits the atmosphere of the game and makes the battles and fights rather exciting. The atmosphere of the game was really great, as it didn't take long for me to be immersed into the world of Devil May Cry. From the level designs to the art style of the game, Devil May Cry's visuals definitely impressed me and just added to the amount of fun I was already having with the game. It also further impressed me as well. The fights themselves are smooth and fast-paced, with the music just really adding a lot to the fights. It definitely got me really into the fights. There's also a lot of stuff to do in the game as well. The main game consists of 20 missions, but it's more than that. There's lots of collectibles, side missions, and more. With storyline, I thought it was pretty good for a hack and slash adventure-action game, It definitely kept me interested until the end, and even wanting more. Fingers crossed that this game does get a sequel. But yeah, adding onto the game's content, there's definitely a lot of replay value, with the various difficulty modes of the game, which can be unlocked by completing other modes. Or going back through levels to collect missed items, find hidden secrets, and more. As I said, a lot of replay value. To be honest, I think at the beginning of the game, Dante was someone you could have mixed feelings for, but I think he had some great character development as the game progressed, developing into a hero that made me proud to have played.  Overall, I found DmC: Devil May Cry to be a great game that I had a lot of fun with until the very end, and yet still wanting more. From an awesome soundtrack to interesting storyline to impressive visuals and atmosphere, this game impressed me in many areas. I had my doubts about this game before going into it, however after giving it a chance and playing it fully through, I can definitely say my initial doubts where proven wrong. I'm glad I took the chance on this game, as I had a lot of fun with it. I've got no problem recommending this game to any of my friends. It's well worth two thumbs up from me.",

            "review_text": "There is no getting around it, DMC being rebooted by a western studio is shocking. So shocking that a lot of fans cried foul and screamed blood murder. Was it for the best? Perhaps it was, DMC 4 was undoubtedly a step backwards after all. Capcom took a chance with outsourcing the IP and surprisingly it paid off.  Meet DmC: Devil May Cry, a young fresh reboot by the team that brought you Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. With a slick, stylized re-imagining of the world home to the Nephilim Dante. Born of the Angel Eva and Demon Sparda, he possesses the power of both. Hunted down by the Demon king Mundus, Dante is dragged into the parallel plane called Limbo at every turn.  While the initial combat impression and the new look might seem jarring at first. After a few minutes you will find that DMC is very much alive under the hood. The intense high level combat gameplay is still there with some interesting new additions to mix things up a bit. Once mastered you will be able to perform the dazzling acrobatic slashing we all know and love with ease again. I say with ease but do not mistake this for the difficulty having eased up. The challenges are still very much there, though I would recommend people familiar with the series start on Hard.  All in all the reboot manages to be fresh, engaging and most of all fun. It will be jarring to some but that is the case with any reboot. If you've enjoyed DMC in the past or enjoy action hack and slash games, give this a shot.",

This game is an amazing entry to the franchise..one that breathes new life into the series..some may hate the new look of Dante(except if you have the DLC then in that case you have nothing to coplain about)but think about this:..if they kept Dante's old appearance, then it wouldn't be called a reboot right? but this is the perfect exaple of a reboot done right! Amazing Gameplay and graphics...great story, one that retells how Dante came to be(with exception of DMC 3, this game is a prequel to that also amazing game :3) and even though people may not appreciate this game or just blatantly hate on it...you havent played DmC then.. If you do hate it then well....your opinion vs the other millions of people who love this game... Anyways i dont want to spoil any of the story or anything at all for that matter but this game is great trust me.. 9/10..fantastic game(it didnt get 10/10 for me because we haz to buy dlc...why capcom why... if it was free..then you guys deserve it :) )",

            "review_text": "Genre: Action-Adventure Platformer / Hack and Slash Sub-Genre: Hardcore Hack and Slash  Atmosphere: 10/10 - The scenery in this game is absolutely breathtaking with art visuals you could chew on for hours. Due to the nature of the gameplay, the background is consistently changing as you progress. This was no lazy task, my friend. The atmosphere immediately immerses you into the world of DMC the second you turn it on.  Sound: 10/10 - Every slice, every shot, every dodge, &amp; every grapple have their own unique sounds. I did not find one recycled sound track throughout the entire game. They are all loud, pronounced, and crisp.  Gameplay: 11/10 - You have five weapons to play with and upgrade: A sword, an axe, a scythe, two guns, and a gauntlet. You have the power to switch these out seamlessly, connecting different weapons for different combos to decimate your enemies. It is fun and easy to get innovative. This game has new game plus, as well as seven difficulty settings to play through. On top of that, there is another game mode called Bloody Palace Mode where you fight hordes of enemies as long as you can, eventually facing each boss as long as you can survive. Points earned in that mode carry over to the normal campaign.  You can compare this game to it's Eastern counterpart if you want to, but why butt heads just for the sake of butting heads?  Ninja Theory took an already developed franchise - some argue not yet fully developed - and rebooted it. They changed the look, they changed the feel, they changed Dante - they changed Devil May Cry.  Does that automatically make it bad? To some it does, and for those people they can negate it's existence all they want. But for the other curious brains out there I can tell you that whether you're a fan of the original or not, this is one solid hardcore hack and slash.    ",

            "review_text": "I'm pretty late with this, considering that I bought the game a week after its release, because I had to look at DmC with quite an ambivalence. After giving it some thought now I decided it's time for my take:  This game is for you if: -you like the devil may cry franchise and are not offended by this being a reboot -you can stomach juvenile personalities and a not-so-ambitious story about a '...schizophrenic world that is being continuously corrupted by the corporate big boss and his lackeys, where you play as the cool guy with super powers that tries to save the world with his fancy weapons and never misses the opportunity for a witty(?) comment.' -you actually know what this game's story and characters are like and don't mind/care -you like fast paced action, a lot of room for creating cool combos and all that with fancy graphics (they really are fancy) -you like to squeeze every last drop out of the provided gameplay mechanics and spend hours and hours to master the game AND feel rewarded for it -you just want to hop into a game, not having to care about anything that is being said, and simply unload on monsters -you like combichrist and noisia (or that type of music in general) -you played the other DMCs and had issues with their difficulty (this game is VERY forgiving)  This game is NOT for you if: -you hate NinjaTheory (and their disrespect towards the fans of the franchise that were not a 100% convinced that this game is/was the second coming) and this seems like a compelling argument to you -you really care about a well written, original story/characters/dialogues - feels like a stereotypical teenager's take on DMC -challenging boss fights are a must for you (there are 6ish bosses that feel like recoloured/textured versions of another - except for the very last one, that one is really good) -you expect a similar skill cap to DMC 3/4 and combo variety of that level - DmC is infinitely easier and the difference between 100 hours and 1000 hours of gameplay/practice is marginal  -you want a built-in turbo mode (there is a mod for this tho)  For a diehard DMC fan like me it was really difficult to give this game a proper review. I mean, look at how awkward it is, even after all this time. I've spent more than a thousand hours on DMC 3/4 on multiple platforms and versions and have yet to master them.  DmC has nothing left to show me after the 100+ hours I put into it - good 100+ hours I admit. Unlike with the former two games, I'm done with this one.  Conclusion: This game is good and you should buy it. Do not expect D'M'C, this is DmC - keep that in mind and you will have a great time.",

With that said, DmC: Devil May Cry is a pretty great game with enjoyable gameplay and a surprisingly good story.    THE PROS:     Surpisingly good story that has a mix of seriousness and jokes.   Fun gameplay that has a 'Stylish' system -- you earn more points by doing combos that uses a variety of different attacks, and not just the same moves over and over again.   As the story progresses, you see Dante go from 'not caring' about anything to actually caring about everything.   Great level design full of secrets.   You unlock new weapons/abilties as you progress.   Weapons and abilities can be upgraded with skill points -- or even new abilities can be unlocked with skill points.   Beating the game on higher difficulties will unlock even higher diffculties multiple times, encouraging multiple play-throughs.   Some cool unlockable skins.   Practice mode.   Around 10 hours until you beat the game.    THE MIXED:     Some may find the game kinda repetitive.   Some may also find the game too 'try hard' and/or cheesy for their taste.   And of course, some may not like Dante's new design (however, I am personally fine with it).    THE CONS:     I personally found the final boss fight and ending to be kinda dissapointing.   Some fights are more annoying/tedious than fun.    THE VERDICT: 8.5/10 'Between Great and Amazing'     DmC: Devil May Cry really is a great game, and I do recommend it. If you get the game, play it on the Nephilim (hard) diffculty, as it will provide a more challenging and rewarding gameplay experience than the other starting difficulties.  ",

            "review_text": "This review will have SPOILERS! I absolutley recommend this game! All those salty O.G. fan boys that are upset cause Dante doesn't have white hair are just that, salty fan boys. This is a REBOOT! It's supposed to be different! This game is an incredible hack and slash adventure with a pretty great stroy. I genuinely bought all of the characters and the chemistry they all shared. The combos are easy enough to learn but difficult to master which makes multiple playthroughs of levels to get better ratings something you'll do often. But let's go step by step through the game.  SPOILER:  Dante does infact get white hair for real at the end of the game. Not just an alternate outfit but his character actually has it. When you selct an alternate costume or weapon skin, STANDARD is thw rod used to describe the things dante has and looks like in the beginning. After you BEAT THE GAME, standard is used for a WHITE HAIRED, PAILER Dante, because he used his Devil Trigger and it gave him white hair. IT WAS A BRILLIANT MOVE BY THE DEVELOPERS AT NINJA THEORY. He get's it when he uses his Devil Trigger to defeat Vergil so anyone HATING this game for the lack of white hair CLEARLY DID NOT PLAY THE GAME TO COMPLETION.  Story:8/10 Short Version: Very god story for a reboot and to me, more engaging than the original Devil May Cry (the first one not the full series) Dante finds Vergil, fights Satan, and tries to save the world. the game ends on a perfect note and sets up a sequel the right way!  Long Version: So like I said, this is a reboot and Dante has no idea he is half angel and half demon (even though his sword has obvioulsy materialized from nothing before and he's been to Limbo multiple times according to him.) So we open with a nightclub party and Dante taking girls to his trailor on the pier. A Hunter demon shows up and Kat, the new love interest, shows up in Limbo to warn Dante that the demons have finally found him. He follows and finds the group known as the Order that she works for. His brother, Vergil, is actually the leader of this group and shows Dante who he really is. Dante agrees to help fight back against Mundus who is essentially the Devil. Hack and slash, platforming, and running around ensues as you fight back against the Demons. The Demons have essentially taken over Earth by taking control of the media and a soft drink with demon chemicals in it. Dante takes down both problems and fights Mundus with his brother. Vergil has alterior motives and wants to take over the world but not for evil purposes, just to protect the humans becuase he beleives they are unable to do it themselves. Dante fights him and Vergil dissapears and the credits roll.  Gameplay:7/10 No lock on function makes aiming a pain if you can't see very well. I never had a single issue during my ENTIRE playthrough without a lock on, but I can see why some may find that annoying. Very fun and fluid combat! Easy combos to learn but more difficult to master. Yes, the S ranking are easier to get than previous DMC games but that doesn't mean they are just given to you. Especially on some groups of enemies. You get multiple wweapons to choose from and some are clearly better than others. Ebony and Ivory aren't even the best gun of the 3 you can choose form which is sort of a let down, but Rebellion is still absolutley insane. Platforming is a blast and the camera hardly gets in your way or fights against you. Generally, you'll use blue (Angel) weapons on blue enemies and red (Devil) weapons on red enemies which makes switching things up in combat a challenge and something you need to do. Devil Trigger is Dante's special ability and it sends every enemy on screen floating and frozen helplessly in the air where you can combo to your heart's content. While I do wish that it just froze time or maybe made Dante faster and stronger, the floating enemies aren't to annoying to hit even when the camera tries to focus away from the one you are hitting.  Controls: 9/10 Everything you do with this game feels natural. All the buttons are mapped in an amazing way that makes everything feel simple, even through you are balancing 12 weapons at once. I felt myslef utilizing every button on the controller and not even in a clunky way. I can't express enough how great a job Ninja Theory did with getting these controls right. It only misses out on a 10/10 for the controls cause there is 1 button that doesn't get used, the left stick click. The right stick click is used to re-center the camera like most games of this type, but the left stick does nothing. The game lacks a LOCK ON function and they couldn't think to put it on the button they hadn't used yet?  Difficulty:6/10 Not very challenging on anything below Son of Sparda. Multiple difficulties to play on with some of he higher ones switching up enemie waves and placements for a pretty much completely new playthrough. Fortunately, unlike most games, you only have to beat the game twice to unlock every difficulty rather than having to beat the game on one difficulty to unlock the one above that and so on.   Graphics:6/10 Not the best looking game on the market and even modest builds could handle it. Just your average, everyday console port!  Length:5/10 4-6 Hours depending on how much you grab along the way. I probably spent a little over an hour total through my run on just checking every corner but a speed run could easily be less than 4 hours. Rather short game but for the genre it isn't unbearable. I wish it would have been longer but that is only because I wanted to play more!   Pros: Ease of entry to the series and genre Story Combat System Character Development  Cons: Graphics Length Lack of a lock on funtion  Final Verdict: 7/10 While the graphics aren't mindblowing and the length leaves you wanting way more, the game does everything else absolutley brilliantly. The character develpoment is on point and, like i said, they set up a sequel with class and it becomes a rebooted franchise that could possibly be better than the original. Still one of the most fun games I have played in a very long time and if you are looking for an amazingly fun time, this is the game for you!",

In my honest opinion, the combat is a hit and miss, though thankfully more of the former than the latter from what I've played.  Yes, it sucks that the color coded knights force you to use either your angel or demon weapon (though from what i've played, i've seen less of them as the game progresses).  However, my main gripe with the game is the lack of a proper targeting system. However, those problems are offset with the overall combat system, as you can easily switch between the Angel and Demon weapons simply through pressing the left and right triggers respectively, which I felt held the game together.",

They're usually all about the combat, which becomes a boring aspect for me a few hours into the game. And yes, they have great visuals most of the times, but visuals isn't a key aspect for me. Then again; they do help to pull the player into the game world.   Anyway, DmC managed to surprise me because of it's environments, fluent combat and, maybe even more important for me; short campaign. You read correctly, a short campaign. It will take a player somewhere between 7,5-12 hours to fully complete one playthrough, which is a decent length and for me long enough to not become boring or overstay its welcome.  The new Dante starts off as an annoying, run-of-the-mill character. But along the way I started caring for him. He grew more mature it seemed.  Dante will start the game with some basic weaponry and will get new moves and weapons until late in the game, which keeps the combat fresh. Obviously, all weapons and moves can be upgraded. And there really are some amazing moves in there. Using a controller I was able to pull off some of the hardest combos. I'll admit, there was some button mashing involved, but most of the times I actually knew what I was doing.  The environments steal the show though. Rarely have I seen environments this brilliant. The TV show (including boss fight) and nightclub levels are some of the best levels I've ever seen in a game. DmC uses a variety of bright colors, while still having a certain gothic feel to it. It's exceptional.  You can tell they put some real love into the PC version since it will never dip below 60FPS. On Ultra settings things look (mostly) sharp and seeing the game in motion is a real treat, especially during the acrobatic (non-)combat sequences.   The voice acting is top notch, but, unfortunately, the story is a bit on the light side.  Time to wrap things up: I had a great time with this game and I would gladly recommend it to all serious gamers out there.  [Rating: 80/100]",

            "review_text": "One of the most underrated games of 2013. DmC Devil May Cry is a fantastic re-imaging of the popular hack and slash series that follows the part demon, part angel nephilim, Dante. Players will make their way through a series of levels that are split between Limbo and Reality, while fighting demons and other monstrosities along the way. Fans of the series initially bashed the game for the new aesthetic stylings that have changed how Dante looks. But this is of little consequence seeing as how his attitude has also been tweaked. He may well come across as an angsty 20-something year old at first, but as the character grows he quickly becomes a solid Dante in his own right, with a strong moral code and personality. Combat is fast, strong and fluid, you can really feel the impact of the various weapons that you will be bringing to battle; be it sword, scythe or ranged weapons, they all pack enough punch to make the ranking combat system worth engaging in. Fans of the series will see some returning faces and ideals, and for those of you that purchase the DL, 'Vergils Downfall' this game could be considered a prequel to Devil May Cry 3. DmC: Devil May Cry is actually a reboot, but some hardcore fans differ on this decision, thus aligning the timeline:  DmC Devil May Cry Devil May Cry 3 Devil May Cry 1 Devil May Cry 4 Devil May Cry 2  But putting that subject aside, this game is damn near perfect with great add on DLC including the free Bloody Palace Mode, definitely a game for fans of sword play. Just like my original review of the game, Dmc Devil May Cry would be scored 9/10. But Steam doesn't score that way, so consider it recommended.",

It was the first tv-ad I can remember showcasing a mature PS2 title and with a badass looking character. I got the game, loved it! Granted the sequel was vastly inferior but after that it seems Capcom has done well with the franchise. The one thing that's always been off with the series has been the lack of story. Much like Mortal Kombat, they actually went back and tried to fix that aspect in the reboot. Is it for the better or for the worse? Better! With DMC4 they obv tried something more but it was for a character we were never attached to, one that never got well recieved and the story overall was a clusterfu*k! This reboot completely re-establishes the DMC universe with interest and for the first time in the series it finally feels right. Gameplay has always been fun but the story was never too much for discussion. I'm thankful Ninja Theory took over this project.  Dante is back! Nero wasn't Dante, this one is for sure. The cockiness and attitude is back, the feel of DMC3 with a younger version of himself is at hand and we get to experience what made the character so great in the first place. Everything comes in place with this game. The best thing is, it feels natural and not forced!  Minor spoilers ahead:     So it's explained Dante is a hybrid and offspring of the love between a demon and an angel, as such he can wield powers between the two races. This is something I cant remember have been explained prior in any of the previous games, BUT it feels so obvious that it should have been! I never gave much thought about it before but now I can't understand how this wasn't part of the old universe! Ninja Theory got me hooked by mission 2 and I've never felt this excited going through the game for the story parts! Gameplay is fine as expected as well, not even worth stating the obvious.  Final word from an old-school DMC fan?  Yes again the look, hated it when it was first released.. It does however fit with his younger self perfectly and honestly it felt natural within the first 3 missions or so. I have to say that if you're unsure because of the idea of the new design and reboot - TRY IT! I'd be surprised if you cant get attached to this amazing persona and gameplay. This is handsdown the best game of the franchise yet with the exception of DMC3 Bosses aren't as memorable and overall the game feels easier despite me being rusty for not playing DMC4 in 5 years. I keep getting A-S ranks in first atempts thus far. ALSO there's some random crashes here and there but its not destroying the game experience since theres now checkpoints during stage progress.  Overall I'd give this a pretty solid 4/5 - I hope this isn't the final entry as I want more of this greatness!",

Talking seriously here, guys, what the heck are you in to blame an entire work for a character? i have to agree, Donte (yes, i refer the new Dante as Donte) , can't be compared with the old Dante, who needs no dirty words, no sexual content or neither pathetic look to earn a legion of fans , but for reals, he ISNT,THAT,BAD, okay? give him a chance, like me, and you'll see the Donte's new look (pfft, really, talk ♥♥♥♥ about a game because they re-designed a character...) and personality CHANGES trough the game, im not here to say 'hur dur, the DmC is way better than original, hur dur' because it isn't, but its an superb job and has everything that characterizes the DmC's gameplay, the combos, the weapons, the upgrades, the hidden things, the orbs is here! only little things have changed and for better.  The Plot of the game is really amazing, full of Critics to our society (the Virility Drink, the Demons who represents men of extreme influence and power),and its everything well planned , the only thing i have to say here is that Kat can be more explored and developed, though, the Nephalem legend-based story for the Twins really fits the characters (thats MY opinion, i dont care if you agree or not, but if you wont, feel free to talk about it)  Graphics , Soundtrack, Dialogues and jokes are really good and add a good temper to the game, everything is beautiful and well designed, the levels of the game have a stunning view, the music is awesome and fits in to the hack'n'slash gameplay, everything here is fine.  The game is incredible, but has its issues, the camera is a pain in the ♥♥♥,sometimes it didn't respond to my right analogic stick and didnt turn left or right, i need to wait a little to turn it,so , i fell often because of this in plataform mini games, the lack of lock in is a great problem that made me miss almost every long combo i try to did, and i found the game too easy (playing on the Nephalem dificulty) if was compared to the old ones.  Yes, i recommend this incredible game, who needs no dante to be good, if you want to be mad at something, talk about the stinky port of the Devil May Cry 3 for the PC, THIS is a thing to be upset with good reasons, 9/10",

            "review_text": "Without touching on the stupid story, cause this isn't the focus:  - The combat is weak as hell. At first glance it seems alright and similar enough to classic DMC, but enemies are incredibly easy to juggle forever - playing this game on Son of Sparda difficulty (the one right before Dante Must Die) is equivalent to playing DMC3 on normal. The game tries to create challenge by putting in enemies that can only be hit by one type of weapon (a very annoying mechanic that goes against the basic concept of the game) or facing you up against really annoying enemies that take way too much effort to open up for attacks at all (do the chainsaw guys seriously need to enter a Hyperarmor state every 5 seconds??). Even DMC3 had its enemy design pitfalls but DmC really becomes just annoying  - Why is the game so easy?? The encounter design is mostly a joke, the bosses are all gimmicks with nothing interesting to them. DMC3 had a lot of crummy bosses, DMC4 fell short on making them interesting beyond the devilbringer interactions - they're both vastly superior to what this game got. The final boss is a retread of DMC3s final boss except its incredibly pathetic in comparison. Good summary for the game in general  - Instead of any sort of interesting level design all this game has is dumb artsy concepts interspersed with copy pasted hallways and floating platforms to spend another hour platforming on. Instead of exploring an ancient demon structure like in 3 you now get to grapple onto blue 'press button' prompts while impact fonts get shoved in your face and the game tries to make you go Wow!!! via some or other stupid manner of bombast that just makes the whole fighting arena look like ♥♥♥♥ (the disco is especially unreadable and offensive to the eyes)  - Constantly breaks up the flow of the game by making you platform. Why so much platforming. What the ♥♥♥♥. Also constantly shoves cutscenes in your face, why is there a shot of dantes eyes every time some demons spawn. DMC usually was nice enough to reserve cutscenes for the start and end of missions, and bossfights.  - For how the game trys to be a reboot they doubledown on the devilbringer, except making it far less interesting and forcing you to use it constantly in pointless sequences that are neither challenging nor fun. Using the subweapons and the special property dodges is an annoyance cause you seemingly cant set it to be a toggle, so I hope you like holding down the trigger buttons all game  It's bad and nothing but dangling keys in front of people who have no clue about the genre (all the visual clutter and the stupidly easy braindead gameplay makes it a normie favorite) and Ninja Theory is a bad developer and I hope they go bankrupt",

            "review_text": ":::::Intro:::::  Devil may Cry DMC is a reboot that explains things in a single package instead of having to play several games to understand the DMC universe. The first thing to note is the big change of him being half angel and half demon instead of just half demon/human. I actually liked this change as it adds more depth to the parents he had and how in a sense they betrayed heaven/hell to be together.   :::::Gamplay:::::   The gameplay is fluid like usual but veterans will find the combos easier to pull off and less challenging overall. New players will find this game quite hard if they are unfamiliar with the DMC universe and have not racked up enough experience with games like this genre. Mostly though I doubt people new to this series will find new dante discouraging in any way or the combat “easy” for that matter, in fact they will find it more enjoyable seeing as how its just as visually appealing as the rest of the DMC games just not as hard to pull off.  :::::Level Design:::::   The level design I don’t see talked about much even when they were recommending this game and I don’t understand why. The level design is pretty great and its not really the details that sell it but rather the variety in animations and movement you see in the environments as you progress through the game. Though notably towards the end this feels less and less true but it was still solid. Note that there is indeed platforming in this game.   :::::Platforming:::::   The platforming is pretty much done right seeing as you use the grapple hooks and wings to navigate throughout the levels. The platforming doesn’t get complex it rather paces itself as you gain powers and is used for boss fights also which is very welcome. Since you know I do not like demon vomit melting me.  :::::Conclusion:::::  The major two positives in this game is the gameplay and level design which for most people is enough to justify buying the game even if its on sale because we are off-put about the new story and characters.",

            "review_text": "Capcom and Dante got a lot of crap for this one. A superfluous decision to reboot a franchise that wasn't in need of rebooting and a grittier, almost 'emo' new look turned a lot of fans off. On top of that, many see Ninja Theory as a rookie developer that still haven't really hit their stride. Games like Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West were both great efforts that slightly missed their mark. I'm glad to say that DmC their best work yet. While I have no qualms over the new art direction, I even enjoy it, I can understand where most fans are coming from. The whole 'emo' look is frowned upon (I, personally, don't think he looks all too emo) and Capcom wanted to reboot the series with a more modern, gritty, western feel. They achieved that. The aesthetics are beautiful in this game, down to the UI and HUD. The style retains a little bit of old Devil May Cry while dabbling in a newer, sleeker look. As for story, it's nothing special. Where Enslaved, I feel, had a great story, DmC takes a step back for Ninja Theory. However, this doesn't detract much from the game. While I can spend time talking about how the game looks and describing why it's story is lackluster, I wouldn't be doing a review of this game justice. The fact of the matter is this game is pure, unbridled action fun. This new entry in the series clearly simplifies the DmC combat/combo system. DMC veterans may not enjoy the main-streaming of the combat. However, anyone who wants to play an explosive action game and feel like a total badass will enjoy this title. The combat, while still holding true to a steep difficulty curve and high skill ceiling, is exhilarating. When you grasp the basics of weapon switching mid combo and using the pull/grab feature this will be some of the most fluid, smooth and rewarding combat you've ever enjoyed. No word epitomizes the combat system better than 'butta' (as in 'smooth as butter'). The combat system definitely lends to the games replay-ability. Die hards will want to work for a better final score on chapters or work to unlock all aspects of the system by unlocking new skills for Dante's weapons. Masochists will get a kick out of the several difficulty levels above the traditional normal mode. This is something the Devil May Cry series has always prided itself on and it hasn't disappeared. Collectors will want to go through each level and play every clever and increasingly difficult secret mission or collect the many Lost Souls scattered throughout the game. A combination of all of those archetypes will find hours of enjoyment in collecting concept art from defeating large amounts of each enemy type and beating the game on the highest difficulty setting. I could truly put this game in the running for Game of the Year 2013. While the game stands mostly on it's combat system, there is definitely more there be enjoyed. For anyone who has bored of Sparda's favorite son, the Vergil's Downfall DLC is also a worthy investment. Playing as Vergil is almost a completely different experience. They do the character justice and it feels fantastic. Anyone who enjoys a good hack n' slash or action game, and anyone who is holding back because of the new decor, take the time and give this game a chance.",

Dante is crass and womanizing, but manages to get away with being a rebel due to his unique ancestry. After several hours into the game his bad-boy personality is peeled away to reveal a fractured individual that mirrors the jagged intersections of limbo that crash into his world.  Gameplay-wise, DmC offers an intuitive 'quick-switch' weapon system that lets you change between several different kinds of weapons in mere seconds for some truly awe-inspiring combos from dedicated players.

The combat's a shallow entry, but after you wade in it for a bit it begins to get deeper; The extra difficulties and DLC will have you coming back to experiment more and more. Though I highly suggest you ignore the ranking system. I commend Ninja Theory for taking the dive, though I do hope they get a better writer for the next game, if there's going to be one. If you still haven't made your decision and you're reading this, just think for a second. How many decent stylish action games does the PC market have? If you like those types of games adding this to your library won't hurt. Not the end all be all, but good for what it is. ============== Long ============== Where do I start with this game? In a Vacuum this game is a solid 7. 'Why a 7' Is probably the question you're asking. Well for starters, the script; while workable and functional leaves something to be desired even though it gets you through the game. I know you've probably heard the outcry for the 'F*ck you-F*ck you' back and forth between Dante and the Succubus; though I guess you could look at that as Dante's such an ♥♥♥ that he has the innate ability to ♥♥♥♥ off demons without trying. No, being an ♥♥♥ is not necessarily a bad thing. Then comes the voice acting. I have to give it a pass simply because the only real cringe worthy lines in the reboot, won't scar your brain like the original (look up 'fill your dark soul with light' on youtube, you'll see what I mean). The voicework is on par with the script. Passable, no stellar performances, some hitches here and there (hitches as in cringe-lines), but it's not bad. For an example of bad, look at the original resident evil, or Sonic Adventure.   The combat is decent. Hell when mastered it's practically on par with previous games, though there are still things that I personally wish they kept. For one, royal guard is no more. That got replaced by the parry system. This system is good and bad, because you can use it intentionally to make enemies kill/damage themselves, but at the same time you'll get a bunch of free points just by accidentally parrying enemies you had no intention of parrying. The H/H weapon is just plain boring to use; effective against certain enemies, but still boring. Sorry but Beowulf was just too damn good to not miss it. Taunts are missing even though there's a free button that's not used while playing with Dante. This was a fun mechanic for funzies that is definitely missed.   Another issue with combat is that it's so loose that when you try to cancel certain moves it causes conflict with the animations which leads to certain abusable bugs or Dante Jerking around. I honestly can't recall previous DMC's having this particular combat bug, though the 'fair play' bug seems to be shared. What I mean by fair play is that enemies usually won't attack you unless they're in the camera's view, or are already in the middle of an attack when the player points the camera away from them. Though sometimes while looking at enemies they behave as if the camera isn't looking at them and they'll just stand there in one spot, confused. This is usually fixed by turning the camera away and turning it back, but at the same time, why would a player want to do that? &gt;.&gt;   This Dante is practically a more solid version of Nero (DMC4). Take note I only say this because I personally found Nero boring/too easy to play with the tools he had. Others will have their own opinions of him.  Compared to previous DMC's the story here is more focused on the main character. Where Dante's given a history. Where as with the original series (as far as the games were concerned) was more a history of Sparda and Dante is simply cleaning up his dad's leftovers. Granted, the story in Vergil's downfall DLC is as anime as it could get, but still the gameplay offered in that DLC makes up for it. I mean I personally found Vergil more fun to play.  The music works for the game. I can't complain about it at all.",

Undoubtedly fun to play, but also quite the visual trip too.  I was one of the ones who thought Ninja Theory (the developers of this reboot) did an amazing job with Enslaved. Game had similar mechanics, but you can see how they evolved their gameplay for this one.  I had always enjoyed the original Devil May Cry's, but thought they were cringe-worthy at moments. This one is genuinely cool. And a blast to play. And, as a fan of 3D, an absolute spectacle with the right setup.  Try it. You'll have a great time.",

The presentation is polished to a mirror sheen and often dazzles with twisted creativity (a certain boss fight and the entirety of Lilith's nightclub immediately come to mind).  Yes the origins of the main characters have been significantly altered, and yes the story occasionally beats you over the head with clumsy edginess to drive the 'message' home. However, the new Dante isn't so different from the old, the one-liners are still cheesy as hell and the cutscenes are still ridiculously over the top. Despite what some would have you believe, this isn't some massive change in tone.  One of my favorite games of 2013. Highly recommended.",

Dante isn't really likeable, the storytelling is awkward and I was embarrassed several times watching really badly-written dialogue exchanges. Worse, I found myself cheering for Virgil, the more put-together brother who bothers thinking ahead to what's going to happen after he and Dante bring down the Evil Overlord. What's wrong with being the guy in charge of picking up the pieces after the world is turned upside down, again? I guess it's bad because DmC has a very marked punk ideology and becoming the authorities goes against that?  So why do I recommend DmC?

Super repetitive. Everything from the areas you are in, to the challenges you must do, to the fights, and overall graphics. Oh look, its another part of the city thats getting mutated into a chaos realm. Joy. Hardly any variation. Levels in this game are what those special 'Artistic' levels in other games do as that one time side mission. Only, these are EVERY part of the game. The gameplay in each is always the same too, with the game going through the same sets of scripted events over and over again. 'Oh, think you made it to the end of the level, NOPE, here are more enemies, or here's a roadblock that suddenly forms causing you to find another way.' Rinse, repeat. I kept hoping for even one level that didnt have that 'you've done way too many drugs' look to it, and it hasnt yet happened. Overall, just playing through these levels and the gameplay, is dull.  2. Too many combos. Sounds silly right? There comes a point when the 8+ buttons your fingers have to manage on a controller have surpassed the insane when it comes to various combinations they must learn and use. Its good for a game to have combos. Games like God of War showed this, Combos gives you that extra bit of exciting 'oomph' to combat beyond bland button mashing. However, this game goes to the extreme with the amount of buton combinations you have to use, enough to tie your fingers in knots. It then scores you based on how many of these seemingly infinite combos you can do. The irony is, many of the enemies DIE before you can manage to do enough combos to often get a good combo rating. This game is litterally like 'Twister' for your fingers.",

Fighting the boss sees more issues with screwed up camera angles that leave you fighting the mechanics to even get to the crystals you need to break instead of fighting the boss or evading his attacks.  You'll also never get full completion without going back to replay earlier missions over again once you have the right tools. In mission 9 you'll never complete it without going through the mission multiple times as you need the gold key and the only way to get it is during a fight by using the enemies to help get you to the upper ledge.

The game length, gameplay, combat, and map design are all the same basic idea/concept. The only major changes are in the graphics, story line, and voiceacting. The actors/charactors say a lot of cliche things but it still comes out as funny and cheeky.  The basic idea - go through short, straight stages while collecting items from monsters and the enviroment. You use the items to unlock doors or purchase upgrades. There is a ton of weapons and upgrades... so many weapons to upgrade you get them through the whole game and some near the end of the game. Most of the upgrades are not major but noticable.  With so many mechanics and weapon juggling - it can get a bit confusing at times. Using a Xbox360 controller I would suggest as a requirement.  I had a good time and kept thinking... I'll just play one more stage and ended up playing three more. I'd recommend it to folks who love third person beat em up games.",

            "review_text": "The hardest thing about replaying the game on higher difficulties settings is the boredom. So many unskippable scenes! There's also parts where the game caps your running speed because shame on you for trying run away from dialogue you've heard before!  In addition to unskippable scenes, the game has the ridiculous habit of letting things 'go on' as you wait for your screen to return from black. Repeatedly on mission 10, I kept coming out the cutscene only to find Danta having walked off a ledge. I don't know how they let that in. To a new player, it'd feel like they'd spawned you only to kill you.   As to a single playhrough, the voice acting or writing is just painfully awful at parts. (Things are either over-acted or have a unnatural word choice for a modern setting). The platforming is also a very annoying chore since Dante doesn't have much ups for being part angel, and his grapples (Demonic Pull/Angelic Lift) have odd targeting delays as you try to chain grapple movements together during platforming.  The controls on keyboard+mouse do not feel good, and the default gamepad controls go against the 'standard' in actions games. (The left button is your gun instead of your standard melee, and the top button is basic melee instead of alt melee. Also, there's two evade buttons, down on the D-pad does nothing by default, and the Angelic mode (LT) vs Demonic (RT) mode mechanic does not feel as well implemented as that of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow's Light mode vs Dark mode, which is a game that came earlier than this one.)  As for the combat, it's alright; not terrible, but it's no where close to the most fun I've ever had. The enemy desigin is a bit boring since a lot of enemies are re-skins of others and have a broken doll motif; (it's very lackluster for a game where demons and angels are real.) Mentioned earlier, the binary mode mechanic feels better done in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. As for how the game fits in the action-adventure genre, I would recommend Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or God of War over this.  UPDATE: Got all the achievements in the Vergil's Downfall DLC. It's even less fun than the main game since:  ■ There's a bug where Vergil can't perform a regular rising strike.  ■ His Devil Triggers offer less security than Dante's Devil Trigger. ■ The targetting on his projectiles is subpar since it can literally pick the wrong platform to materialize during platforming. ■ On the subject of platforming, Vergil doesn't have a regular double jump; (he still has a way to get high, but I don't know why they made it less intuitive). ■ A lot of his attack animations are slow and long compared to Dante equivalents; (it's especially bad for his standard melee). ■ His dodging is just awful compared to Dante's. The immunity window seems even shorter than Dante's regular dodge, and Vergil's dodge can be cut short if there's an enemy in his path. ■ You will take hits from enemies outside of your view. This happens sometimes in the main game (especially against harpies), but it's more common in Vergil's downfail since there's more harpies and enemies that like perfoming 2-hit combos. ■ The main boss fight in the DLC (mission 5), is a lot cheaper than any of the bosses in the main game. He has 2 attacks that are extremely hard to dodge; projectile swords which you can't destroy with your projectiles, and a dive bomb kick that interrupts Vergil's dodge and forces Vergil to take damage. There's also this annoying bit where he teleports away and you need to repeatedly have great timing in dodge a ring of projectile swords; it's a lot less forgiving than anything in the main game.",

As someone whose played all the games (except for the infamously disappointing 2nd game), this definitely ranks amongst the best in the series.   I feel that the combat is more fluent, varied, and more open to experimentation than in any of the previous Capcom games.   It's understandable that people resented and were judgemental of this younger, dark haired version of Dante. Even I, as a fan of the series, was a little put off just because it was DIFFERENT. And gamers typically don't appreciate changes.  But developer Ninja Theory has given him more personality, depth, and emotion than any of the Capcom-developed entries.   You'll see his character grow as the plot moves on, and certain events happen which take a toll on him. Classic Dante (in the older games) has only two traits: style and badassery. This version of him gets pretty boring after you realize how two-dimensional he is.  But Ninja Theory has crafted a deeper, relatable version of the iconic protagonist. Yes, the style and badassery remains in abundance, but Dante is more than that in this game. I've never been so into a Devil May Cry story as I am with this game.   Character depth isn't limited to Dante; the game has a wealth of likable (or despicable) characters with a lot to them. The superb voice acting does well to compliment this.   Visually, the game is gorgeous. Colorful and vibrant, and plenty of incredible art and style also make this game stand out amongst the rest, particularly DMC 1 and 3, which sport dark, gothic color pallets, and generally have a depressing vibe (for me, at least).   I can't recommend this product enough. If you consider yourself a fan of the Devil May Cry games, you NEED to play this. Don't be put off just because Dante's freakin hair is a different color. Yes, its tone is wholly different than the previous games, but it's place is well-earned amongst them. In my own opinion, the combat and story have never been better.   Ninja Theory has crafted an excellent product, and a sequel is very much deserved. Look forward to DMC5 from Ninja Theory!",

Ninjia theory must have redesigned that charactor to meet the mainstream-appreciation. It was a smart move, I'd say. On the other side, Ninjia theory do know how to tell a story. It's attractive, interesting, and curious. Vergil and Kat are both successfully designed. Vergil being ruthless and cruel, Kat being simple and loyal, all the charactors are convincing and natural. The feeling while playing the game is defferent, though.There are lessing voice-effect. When dante smashes and slicing, it turns out to be much more quiet than former games.

As a person who really didnt know what to expect from this I think this is a solid hack and slash. The attack animations all look good and combat flows nicely between different angel and demon weapons. I didnt use guns that much though aside from occasionally using them to keep a combo going. There are a number of cinematic bossfights, one of which I have to include as one of my favorite boss battles Ive ever played. There is great variety in the environments and level design which made the act of moving between enemy fights more enjoyable and a lot less boring. The story is nothing special really. Overall when you judge the game without looking at the previous games. It deserves at least an 8/10",

Negative reviews seem to stem from mostly from that fact that this is not similar to the previous games that bear its name Devil May Cry. Since I haven't played any of the previous games, I will review this game on its own merit.  I found the story to be shallow but interesting in parts. The cut scenes were entertaining and the voice acting was very good. The in game story itself wasn't very driving, but I wasn't expecting more. I felt the game controls to be challenging, even using a controller instead of keyboard and mouse. Sometimes controlling Dante I felt like I was controlling a tank; it was difficult to position him precisely. Also some weapon animations were difficult to control: once you've started some attacks, you cannot stop or adjust direction. This can be frustrating at times and limits the feeling of fluidity of the character.  Camera control was similar. At times it was difficult to place the camera correctly to see your enemies- the camera would not rotate past a nearby wall. Because of this, jumping puzzles are unforgiving. For example, it seems unfair when after a big boss fight, you lose all health by having ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and missing a jump to fall into flames. This game was interesting and perhaps a good segue into the series as now I am interested in the other DMC titles. ",

I purchased this because it was on sale and I can say that I would have gladly paid full price had I known some of my preconceptions were wrong.  I intentionally avoided DmC for a while because I was under the impression it would have an overly emo, whiney vibe. I probably got that idea from the Angry Joe video review (if you've seen it then you know what I'm talking about). Thankfully, it's not at all as bad as Joe's video indicates in that regard and that terrible music video from his review is nowhere to be found (yet lol).   The main gripe people seem to have is the 'new' Dante, both his look and his attitude. While he doesn't sport the classic Dante look, with the blonde hair and red jacket, his look is perfectly acceptable IMO. I don't really see the emo connection, except that I personally will never opt for that hairstyle. His attitude is that of a young man that can pull hot chicks. He goes to clubs and gets laid so his somewhat cocky attitude should be of no surprise. Take it or leave it...I myself don't care one way or the other.  The strong point of any Devil May Cry game has always been the combat and DmC definately delivers in that department. It's similar to previous games in the franchise but perhaps a bit more accessable. I like the camera a lot better here, more in line with your typical 3rd person perspective. The camera doesn't rotate all over, zooming in and out dynamically, which always bugged me about the previous games.  While it doesn't have a soundtrack with classic thrash metal ala the Big 4, it has a relatively exciting soundtrack with some nice chugging heavy metal riffage going on.  TBH I haven't played this very much yet, just thought I'd drop a quick note giving my initial impressions. Like me, if you were avoiding it thinking it'd be overly emo, give it a shot, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

In order to truely enjoy this game i'd recommend using an Xbox 360 Controller, a Logitech Wireless Gamepad F710, or a newly usable Xbox One Controller for PC. If you plan to use either Xbox controller you will need to get the Microsoft Drivers off their site, but honestly it's worth it. Well, here we go: DmC is a reboot to the Devil May Cry series, set in the present day, with new weapons and a new setting for  New  Dante. You join forces with  New  Vergil and Kat a human Wicca who uses her Wiccan spells to help Dante traverse Limbo (The Land Between the Demon world and the Human world). You spend the course of the game acquiring new weapons, abilities, and powerups much as you did in the previous games. The standard game play can be seen as  'easier'  than previous Devil May Cry games, but as in the older games you can always step it up to Dante Must Die!, Heaven or Hell, and Hell or Hell modes. Which are far more challenging and provide that sought after level of difficulty. The Vergil's Downfall DLC provides some great follow up content to the main game and fills in some missing information relating to Vergil and Dante's past and future. I look forward to DmC: Devil May Cry 2, but in the meantime I plan on playing until I max out everything and getting to that sweet 90% completion rate. You may ask yourself why I said 90%, well then you obviously have never played Hell or Hell mode.. All in all, this game is fantastic and does the series a much needed change of pace.

The general story was quite interesting and kept me playing some nights for way longer than I should have, the extra difficutlies that can be unlocked when completing the game make a lot of replayablity for the game. After playing all the other games before this one I still like the change of character for Dante, and I love the original version a lot of people have been saying this game is ♥♥♥♥ for the sole reason that they changed how Dante looked and acted but even taking that into consideration it was an amazing game and the change was a negative for me at all. Overall I would defineltey recommend playing this game, I loved it and it had a great story. Although I had one problem with the game and that was that there wasnt enough different kinds of enemies, the bosses were all quite different and they were great, but the enemy encounters you would get going through the levels felt quite similar a lot of the time I think a good way to have stopped that would have been to add some more compleltey different enemmies not different variations of the same one. Anyway this game is a good game and I would recommend it, a great game to play for the story and bloody palace mode can keep you going for hours if you are good. 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "This is the coolest game I've ever played. I'm a big fan of stylish, intricate, fast paced and varied combat, but often combat like that is difficult to perform in video games - requiring you to master some kind of clunky weapon changing system. DmC does a great job of making a plathora of weapons and an even larger plathora of combo moves for each one very intuitive and accessible. This means you can get wrapped up in the story and illustrate it with beautiful fights without the frustration of a 'learning curve' for controls. I looked at the list of moves available and thought I would never be able to use them all, but before I knew it I was handling a mob of enemies with 5+ different weapons at once and looking like a badass. Maybe some hardcore players will find it too easy, but you can choose the difficulty setting and then unlock even more difficult settings.  I highly recommend using a gamepad like the Xbox 360 controller to play.  Combat is definitely the central and most impressive feature of this game, but there are other great things to be said of it as well. It looks great; it's gritty and bloody but doesn't feel like a boring gorefest because fo the imaginative 'limbo' world where the streets split apart before your eyes and chunks of the world become floating platforms. The story isn't legendary but it fits the gameplay perfectly. The voice acting is good, and although he starts off as a brat I came to like the nuances of Dante the main character. He's pretty easy on the eyes, too..  The story doesn't take long to get through but you are encouraged to play the missions many times over to find hidden items, increase your score, and try new difficulties. Since the controls are intuitive and accessible, you could easily put this game down for a while and come back to it to keep working on your scores. I didn't have any complaints as I played it. Some people pointed out that the boss fights were a bit of a let down, and maybe it's sort of true. But for whatever they lack in challenge, they sure make up in imaginative and horrifying creepiness.  I highly recommend this game if you want some fast paced action, and you don't have to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy it.",

The story is competent, but the characters need work. The love interest isn't interesting (ironically), and Dante isn't great either. The platforming sections, despite being easy and a bit pointless, are fun and I found myself liking them, whether or not I wanted to. The visual design (along with the combat) is the game's greatest strength. Each level has its own aesthetic--from an upside-down city to a digitized news network--and they all look great.

            "review_text": "Before I purchased this game, I had already owned the HD collection on my Xbox 360 and DMC4 on there too. I tried playing through DMC3 and it was quite enjoyable, however I feel like you can only enjoy the game truly by having some form of nostalgic value to it.  And this brings me to my review for DmC: Devil May Cry. This game enters a whole new realm of Devil May Cry, with a completely fresh storyline, new gameplay with how weapon switching was dealt with, and new ways to get around this amazingly designed world that is Limbo. There are 3 different guns to use, including the classic Ebony and Ivory, and 5 melee weapons, with Rebellion being one of them and the new idea of Angel and Devil weapons being implemented.  In terms of the combat I see mostly nothing wrong with it -- when you get your first SSS rank in combat it feels very rewarding with the voices that are said upon obtaining an S rank or above in Stylish rating. The weapons synergise very well, with 'Deft' abilities being added to most weapons, meaning you can use a move on one weapon just by comboing with another weapon, e.g. using Rebellion then going into the Arbiter to do a Trinity Smash. The only problem with the combat is the gun called the Kablooey -- I feel it is too rewarding with the lack of effort you have to put in to use the weapon. I have reached SSS ranks just by blowing up a lot of enemies, which only requires me pressing X. Another problem is that Ebony and Ivory drop off very fast, with the shotgun being better to deal with most enemies, and the Kablooey being very overpowered.  The story is decent, being consistent all game and providing interesting and new ideas to the bosses in the Devil May Cry boss scene, the most intruiging one being the news reporter fight. Never in my life have I fought a giant digital head! The only thing with the story is that half the time you're not really focused on it and more on the fact that you're constantly being pulled into the world of Limbo, which I frankly care much more about -- the level design was practically perfect and the cutscenes were beautiful from start to end. The small flashbacks near the start of the game which sent you into quite peaceful broken worlds to unlock new abilities and weapons were extremely useful in helping me learn to play the game.  Now to address the start of my review. I am not an exprienced player in the Devil May Cry world, not having played the previous games when I was younger. From the perspective of someone who is new to the genre of Hack n' Slash or new to the Devil May Cry franchise, this game is probably your best bet into getting into the games as it will most likely pique your interest into the other games, as it did mine (I am going to finish DMC3 and play DMC4 now). However I feel like this DmC game is quite separated from all the other games, with just the characters' names and the idea of the brotherly story being the only part which links to Devil May Cry. A long-time DMC player will most likely tell you DMC3 and 4 are the best, however me being a fresh player I can say that you will probably only enjoy them more if you have a nostalgic link to them.",

            "review_text": "This game is *amazing*, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.    Sure, people complain and talk smack about it because of redesigned characters, but that's really nitpicking, considering how the other DMCs have almost zero story or character development in the first place.   So we'll start there. The story of DMC is great. Very interesting how instead of half-human, Dante and Vergil are 'Nephilim', which is an angel/demon hybrid. Don't wanna say much more about the story, except that I feel they drew heavily upon the reality of our existence on this planet (Media, banking etc. controlled by sinister forces).   The story affects the combat in that Dante has Angel weapons (Left trigger) and Demon weapons (Right trigger). They're all very stylish, although most will probably stick to the demon weapons since the angelic ones are very weak (although they look awesome -- a scythe and a giant shuriken).   The game consists of ~20 missions, and within those missions are hidden items and secret missions with specific combat or platforming goals. I'd wager it's about a 15 hour adventure, although between this version and the 360 version, I've got about 50 hours into it. This is made possible due to the many difficulty levels. About seven, I believe. I recommend starting on Nephilim, unless you're entirely new to this franchise or action games in general.   This game looks amazing, especially in Limbo. Limbo (purgatory) is where you'll spend the vast majority of the game. It's always twisting and turning to some effect, whether it be to block your progress, trying to trap you, or throwing enemies at you. You can move the camera as you wish, although you probably won't have to often, as the auto focus is very well done.   Honestly, there's not much to complain about in DMC. Devil Trigger is almost useless and nowhere near as cool as it could be, which was a disappointment. As mentioned before, the Angel weapons are overshadowed by the Demon weapons due to weak power. This ties into my biggest issue with the game, which is the enemies. There's not a whole lot of enemy variety, and the color-coded ones force you to use either all-angel or all-demon weapons.   The Style ranking system is perhaps a little too easy, whereas previous games required a LOT of practice to achieve S rank or higher. I think this was a design choice to enable more casual play (you feel like a total badass without having to dedicate many hours to the game), but this could easily be fixed by having the Style system fluctuate with the difficulty level. Other complaints are the way Vergil is handled (can't spoil it), and the lack of a lock-on...both of which I actually enjoy. Yes, sometimes you'll attack a different enemy than you wanted, but it's kind of rare, and I personally only encountered it when dealing with the flying enemies, and even then it was easily remedied by closing some distance.   Ultimately, DMC is my favorite Devil May Cry game. I loved the others (minus 2), but this reboot, DMC, is by far the edgiest, most stylish game I've ever played. The way Dante's coat flows through combat, the way his sword sheans with each slice, enemies gibbing and shredding when killed...the list goes on with ways of making each battle make you're killing these demons with extreme prejudice. And although the boss battles are certainly too easy, their presentation, along with the rest of the game, is phenomenal.   9/10.",

The reimagining smoothing explains away many of the weird setting quirks the games have had, and actually made you feel like this was happening somewhere real, as opposed to a gothic backdrop for killing monsters. Also, many of the reimagined changes could be applied to the rest of the series without too much effort, if you want this game to be canon with the rest of the series. The motion capture is absolutely incredible, I could read so much from the expressions of some of the characters. The voice acting is superb - oh man, have I missed the Devil May Cry trash talk.  The combat has been streamlined - with the removal of a lock-on button, there is now room on the controller to be able to switch weapons mid-fight without going into a menu. The lack of the lock-on button only gave me problems twice, otherwise the game correctly predicted which enemies I was interested in attacking. The bosses are varied and imaginative, ending with a tight, responsive final fight that tests everything you have learned in a satisfying manner.",

Granted, it is not quite as difficult as say Devil May Cry 3, but it can be difficult, especially at the higher difficulty levels like Dante Must Die mode. What I found makes this game easier that previous Devil May Cry games is that Dante very rarely is attacked by off-screen enemies like he was in DMC 3.  People may take issue with Dante's new appearance. I did at first, but after playing the game, Dante turned out to be a more relatable, humanistic protagonist than he was in the previous games. As for his short, black hair, again, makes him a bit more of a realistic character, in my opinion. Without giving anything away, I believe that Devil May Cry fans (and fans of the original Dante) will be very satisfied with this game's conclusion. SPOILER:   At the end, Dante's hair becomes white &amp; we get to see how &amp; why that came to be. Also, the origins of the rivalry/feud between Dante &amp; Virgil.    The combat in this game is extremely smooth and fluid. You never have to dig into any menus to change your weapons, all of this is done from the D-Pad (assuming you're playing with a controller). Left on the D-Pad cycles through your 2 Angel weapons (fast &amp; weak, made of small groups of enemies), right on the D-Pad cycles though your 2 Devil weapons (slow &amp; strong, made for single strong or shielded enemies), and up on the D-Pad cycles though your 3 firearms. This makes stylish combat a joy and much easier to pull off since all your weapons are readily accessable.

Visually it's a gorgeous game, the setpieces are great, the cinematics make sense and if you are diehard game completionist it will challenge you. There are plenty of customizations that you aren't locked into, so if you wish to reassign your upgrades to different weapons between levels you have that option. Health is rare, and can be expensive but the checkpoints are accomodating...even if you die (on regular difficulty) which may be a bit too coddling but if anything it's representative of today's gaming culture.",

I love the humor in this, design of movement, extra content and a good gameplay. Really made me want to go back and play it over again, to reach all the bonuses.  I also love the 'bad' part of Dante, and showing how someone who looks as if it exist mearly to cause problems and lay everything that moves, has in fact morals and an ability to care for a person. Aim his energy at demons and tell him to kill them, and you can see the other side in his free time.",

DMC delivers, to my eyes, the most flowing, beautyful, violent, satisfying combat systems of all times in video games history in my opinion and DMC Devil May Cry still has it! but this time its also much more playable with mouse and keyboard than it was with previouse games of the franchise the games plays well on maximum settings and looks stunning.  the only downside i have is:.........  WHERE IS DANTE'S COOL SILVER HAIR!!!!!!!!",

The general story was quite interesting and kept me playing some nights for way longer than I should have, the extra difficutlies that can be unlocked when completing the game make a lot of replayablity for the game. After playing all the other games before this one I still like the change of character for Dante, and I love the original version a lot of people have been saying this game is ♥♥♥♥ for the sole reason that they changed how Dante looked and acted but even taking that into consideration it was an amazing game and the change was a negative for me at all. Overall I would defineltey recommend playing this game, I loved it and it had a great story. Although I had one problem with the game and that was that there wasnt enough different kinds of enemies, the bosses were all quite different and they were great, but the enemy encounters you would get going through the levels felt quite similar a lot of the time I think a good way to have stopped that would have been to add some more compleltey different enemmies not different variations of the same one. Anyway this game is a good game and I would recommend it, a great game to play for the story and bloody palace mode can keep you going for hours if you are good. 9.5/10",

It's actually incredibly good for being a reboot of the origin story and it fits in lore wise since the past was left out of the previous games for the most part. The combat is fluid and feels much nicer than the others, though its's not as complex. Story was to be expected, knowing the series I called every little bit of it, but it was fun to see it play out and I enjoyed it.  TL:DR It does DMC franchise justice 9/10",

            "review_text": "I was genuinely surprised with this one. After what I heard from fans I knew personally, I thought it would be unpleasant. Not bad, just not fit for the DMC label.  PROS: -The swordplay... holy crap. This is the most satisfying combo-ing (is that a word...? Is now!) in the series. In any gmae I've played! You can resume combos even after switching weapons. It's also very easy to swtich, with 3 at your disposal at any time and the other 2 just a single press on the D-pad away, meaning it's possible (in theory) to include all 5 of Dante's melee weapons in one string of attacks. They're also quite balanced and a ton of fun to use on their own. -The grappling hook mechanic and other aspects of the game's platforming work exceedingly well. First Devil May Cry game where I actually look forward to platforming instead of wanting to rip what little hair I have out. -I dig the look of the game. The environments look quite nice. Characters do as well. As for other aspects of the characters, we'll get to that later. -The music isn't quite up to snuff here, but it's still good for what it wants to do. The fighting is backed up by nice and energetic tracks while the calmer moments have some decent enough atmospheric pieces. -Voice acting is well done. As for the writing itself...  CONS: -The story is BAD! It's basically Internet: The Video Game. All the parallels it draws are way too on-the-nose for what's supposed to be a serious game. There are other problems, but I'll not say anything to avoid spoilers. -The writing for some characters is absolutely horrendous. I like swearing... a lot... but there's a time and place for it. DmC just throws it out there like a 12-year-old who's just starting to learn how to use the words correctly. It grates after the first couple of missions, and then keeps going on with it for the rest of the game. -Guns are weak to the point of being absolutely useless. I only use them out of habit. -Overall, the game is a bit on the easy side. Great for newcomers, but I've been with the series since day 1. Dante's just a bit too powerful for what the game throws at you. Series veterans should probably start the game on hard. I've been sticking to normal, again, out of habit.  MEH: -Didn't need 3 dodge buttons. One button for basic dodge roll would have been fine. Other dodges are unnecessary.  -Devil Trigger should not include anti-gravity. It's there for when you need a momentary boost, not as an 'I win' button. -Dante is really unlikable at the start of the game. He gets better though. Overall, I like him, but... -None of these characters really fit in a Devil May Cry game, except maybe Virgil, but that's a bit of a stretch. -I keep forgetting there's no manual lock-on and dodge rolling into enemies. It's not a problem really, as the auto-lock goes where I want it.  VERDICT: It's good, plain and simple. Quite good actually. I don't care about story in DMC to begin with, so the problems I have with it are just an annoyance. If they're going to do another game, keep the gameplay like this with a few tweaks and bring back the old characters. Yeah, they're bishie, but that's part of the fun.  All this being said, if you have a PS2, get DMC3. It's better overall. Otherwise, get this. The PC version of DMC3 is awful.",

However, on it's own, it's a good game. I feel like it could have been better. I was kind of waiting to see what that the deal with the necklaces, but I guess it wasn't important. Also, half angel and demon? I get that they wanted to make him special in some sence, but think that move was myopic. Dante isn't human. Thats not right. The ending was also a lot unrealistic. Vergil was the biggest let down in the whole game. I don't understand Ninja Theory. You paint Vergil as being being a super nerd, a basic enemy had him pinned down (an demon you take out with reletive ease), based on what we say of vergil, we couldn't fight, and (SUPER SPOILER) AHEAD) at the end of the game he goes toe to toe with dante? And he pulls out all these high skill moves? No. No. No. Didn't like that at all. There were a couple things about this game that just made you say 'huh?'. But that's all story line.
