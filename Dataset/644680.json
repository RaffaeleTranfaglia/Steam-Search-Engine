    "description": "These episodes take place BEFORE &quot;Libra of the Vampire Princess&quot;, so they're a great introduction into Libra's vampire world. They're also perfect for fans who crave more of Libra's expanded universe. Both episodes were funded on Kickstarter thanks to our amazing Backers.",
