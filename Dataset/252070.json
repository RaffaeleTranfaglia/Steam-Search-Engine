Multiple weapons, engines, sensors, parts to design your own ship. It is all 2d pvp and it WILL let you make a horrible ship lol. You are provided plans and also can steal others sjhips plans. I recommend this game to anyone who loves ship custimization. I have 14 of my 25 hrs on just making crazy ships.",

However, there are matchmaking options so you dont get put in to a game with people that are building monster ships. The game uses semi-newtonian physics. As in if you are in motion you will stay in motion until the drag from the air slows you down. There are limitless ways to design your ships too. Some designs may be better than others. You can also host your own bot game in case you just want to play with bots.",

            "review_text": "Good game. Needs single-player content. Nobody plays it multiplayer anymore.  Has occasional performance problems - I experienced this with small ships (not the monster unlimited-budget ships available recently). Probably related to point-defense targeting on my ship vs. bomb/missile spam as far as I could tell. Didn't have the patience to diagnose further.  If you have a dedicated group of friends to play this with, get it. If you don't, get Reassembly instead - it's similar to this game (design-your-own top-down 2D spaceship-combat-game), but designed for single-player from the ground up.   Side note: The game lets you share ship designs in .PNG images. The image portion of the file shows a picture of a ship, but the actual data of the ship design used by the game is stored in a custom PNG chunk in the same file. This is an *utterly brilliant* idea, and the creator gets major props from a fellow game developer for coming up with this.",

            "review_text": "Tough decision. The game is good! The ship building system gives lots of freedom. The physics are done well!  ...BUT...  There are 0-3 players online. The game modes are meant to be played cooperatively, but there's noone to cooperate with. Most older players just build and showcase their 'awesome' ships... and that's all. I've had fun playing FFA against friends and learning how to build effective ships, but that's just not good enough for a commercial game.  I'll say 'yes' for now, but if it stays like that, I'll switch to 'no' later.  UPDATE: The ship building system does give lots of design freedom, but if you want your ship to be effective in combat, you HAVE to use certain parts in a certain ways. Parts need to be rebalanced for this to become less of a toy and more of a game. There's this 'autoaim' module that is too good for its price - ships with fixed weapons or manually mouse targeted weapons are strictly worse. It seems the 'aiming' is done server-side too, which amplifies the importance of 'autoaim'.  Switching to 'no', hoping for a miraculous update that will bring the game back to life.",

Control are bad and cannot be configured properly (e.g. it just said BracketOff for zoom which doesn't seem to work on German keyboard). Enemies took more shots than I had ammo. You only see properly when zoomed out but then I hardly saw my own ship's rotation. Maybe there's a good game hidden somewhere in that, but the first impression was so bad I'm not really curious enough to continue.",
