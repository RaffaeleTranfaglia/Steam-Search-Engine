I'm not kidding! I've also played against people five times my level, and most games I play have lopsided teams or AFK players.  Other issues include unusual, slightly broken English and very weird text layouts. They need to standardize the size of their text, because some HUD elements look messy and unprofessional.  A good concept, but not very well executed.",

            "review_text": "For a free, early access game this is looking pretty good so far. I enjoy flying around and defeating other dragons with the use of missiles and plasma cannons. I even went through a phase of playing this game often and in doing so, I noticed I was playing with the same players over and over. Even the leaderboards contain mostly players I have seen and played with before. After playing against some of the same people a few times, it can actually feel like two players have something against each other and begin trying to kill each other more than the other players. As with many games, you can hurt players on your team which can lead to you being betrayed (this normally only happens when there are no enemies and your team seems to get bored easily) or accidentally hit. Of course this problem lies within player attitude and not the game itself. I can say though, that the lack of enemies (or teammates for that matter) seems to be down to the game seemingly having no team balancing which results in a lot of unfair matches.  The flight feels quite nice and fluid for the most part but it can be hard to determine the scale and distance of certain objects in the environment. So when you are flying around and you notice you're coming quite close to something large, you usually try to turn sharply or pull up which is difficult sometimes as the dragon seems to want to almost drift and keep moving forward as opposed to just sharply and swiftly pulling up. Most of the time you end up crashing into said object which makes you more vulnerable to attack.   The turret/weapon system is great. It features a number of weapons and items to help you in battle such as plasma turrets (default weapon/fire type), missiles and a special attack that is performed with the R key if I can remember correctly. Most of the special attacks are short range and have what seems to be a spherical radius. In my opinion, the Ogre's (big green, tank-like dragon) special attack is overpowered, since he can stun you and keep you in one spot then use his vast amount of health and firepower to quickly dispose of you.  Anyway, my next point about the turret and weapons system is that the crosshair seems to take a very long time to catch up with where your dragon is looking which can be annoying when you have a clear shot ready but your crosshair is nowhere to be seen. Earlier I mentioned items. These items include stamina refill, weapon cooldown, mines (that float in the air) and a smoke screen (I may have missed something from the list). These also have a cooldown period but can give you an edge in battle and instantly regenerate upon respawning after death. The mines and smoke screen can be good items to use and can make a great combo as you can drop a mine if you're being followed, then drop the smoke screen which will blind your enemy and lead them to fly into the mine. The smoke screen can also hide you when you're on low health and allow you to escape. Your dragon can be given a speed boost (shift key) which takes stamina rather quickly but (if you have it equipped) you can use your stamina refill to give your dragon a second boost.  I did notice that the models and sounds seem to be based off other games/movies...  The Inara - Ikran (Avatar) (Similar sounds too) The Fury - Toothless (HTTYD/2) (Also similar sounds) The Vampire (mainly it's head) reminds me of creatures from the old game Altered Beast but may just be a coincidence. Tiamat is given the same name as the bat queen from Darksiders (perhaps this dragon was given this name instead of the vampire since it would have looked too close to Tiamat). Again, perhaps it's just coincidence or I'm just looking into it too much.  This game is very team based with nice graphics and a great idea behind it. It's a great game for passing the time and having fun and can actually be quite competitive. When you have balanced teams, it can be very enjoyable. If you enjoy team based, dragon flying, weapon firing action then this game is for you. I recommend trying this game and seeing what you think. I may have written a bunch of bad points (which I seem to find it hard not to with most things) but I do really like this game.  I apologise for this painfully long (not as painful as my overuse of certain words) review but thank you for reading - if you didn't die of old age before getting to the end... This is my first review.",

They all use the same crappy cannon instead of rockets or the pulse one. They also clearly don't use the Cooldowns. I can shoot 6 missles at any Dragon within like 3 seconds (enough to kill most); then just wait 20s for recharge and repeat.   Get a fast dragon, use the missles or the pulse charge - and equip TWO cooldown reductions. BAM.",

The flying is fun and it is just a blast to glide about as a dragon, zooming through the environment.  the combat feels good and challenging, a real accomplishment when you finally get the hang of it.  the one problem I have with the game is the community. I have nothing against the Russian players like other people in the review section do but because of the language barrier, it's hard to communicate as a team. Plus some of the players are just really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, deciding to shoot you down, a member of their team, during a team deathmatch (or whatever its called in this game, sorry I can't remember) just because they are bored or they think it's funny.  all in all, a great game that with work, has serious potential.  I'd probably rate this game 8/10",

This game perfectly balances the two beautifully.  PS: Toxor is NOT OP. In fact, this game is pretty balanced. I main Fury for his special ability and high speed, and I rarely get killed in game. Toxors, Ogres, and Skats are the easiest for me to kill: Toxor for their lack of in-battle maneuverability, Skats for their low health, and Ogres for their low turning speed.",

F2p with no micros or pay to win. Give it a whirl.  tl;dr: ♥♥♥♥ing laser mounted dragons fighting in air with one another with decent dogfighting mechanics.

            "review_text": "  *Sigh* I'm going to be frank.  Pros:  - You get to play as a dragon, *****ing duh.  - Originality of the dragons. (In my opinion, the game could use dragons with different weapons, like Tiamaut or whatever having rockets or something. Also, could use more dragons, as stated in cons. For instance, a Hydra or Ice dragon, something of that magnitude.)  Cons:  - Clunky, kind of poor controls.  - Limited number of players.  - Disappointing amount of dragons to play as.  I may download this game again ONLY if you fix those things. For now, though, I am sorry to say I have removed the game. I hope to see that it has improved in the future.",

            "review_text": "Please note: I do actually plan on fixing and editing this review with playtime and this is more of a first look than a review.  There will be a TL;DR  Now, for what I saw so far.    With a dev team of only 7 people this game is good. It looks like they all put effort into the game, and it's optimized beautifully. That being said, a small team doesn't always make the best games mechanics and graphics wise. When I first started the game I was thrown in a room with a dragon staring me in the face, and a basic UI. To the left is information about your dragon, to the right is the possible dragons you can unlock (with info if you hover over the picture of the dragon), the top (which gives you a barebones settings option, an option to quit, and an option to start the game), and the bottom which is filled with items that you can use in the match    The actual gameplay is solid and the gunplay is easy to get into, however there are only two game modes available as of the time this review is written: TDM or DM. Fairly basic modes whos main goal is to get you to understand the weapons that are mounted on to your dragon... and every other dragon. As far as I can see, there are very little if any diversity in the weapons attached to every dragon. This makes the two game modes a battle of 'Who can shoot first' situation. To combat this they give you a shield you can use to block incoming attacks, but nobody really uses it.   Overall this is what you come to expect from a free game. This is truely free: No cash shop and no DLC. Everything in the game can and has to be acquired in game. So far this is only dragons, but hopefully this changes in the future.   Pros: + Truely free + The flying feels great + It's optimized hardcore  Cons: - The audio sounds royalty free - No diversity in weapons - Graphics aren't the best - No real graphics option  TL;DR  The game is okay but there's not a lot of content.",

            "review_text": "This is a early play review  Basically this game looks like a typical dogfighter, however, instead of jets or helicopters you control a dragon. just thinking that a flying manta ray could be classified as a monster, I'm not sure it fits into the 'dragon' catagory.  Each dragon has a different characteristics and special abilities that are indicitive of that species. Blinding the enemy, breathing fire for close range combat, Poison, explosive blast, vampiric leaching of life, stunning, healing yourself and ally etc.  Limited purchasable items are available for the dragons. Items can be won or earned by logging into the game or after the match via the lottery. The items currently include skins or 'DNA Points' for the dragons but not much else. Weapons, dragons, abilities can't be upgraded using points as far as I have seen but I could be wrong.  The arenas are nicely constructed with beautiful detail and they range in size, but aren't very dynamic. ie No destructable content. (The plasma orb that can kill a dragon won't leave a burn mark on the landscape let alone make a pit in the ground or walls)  As for the gameplay, the controls aren't very difficult. Standard w,s,a,d movement with q and e as altitude control.  The shield (triggered by holding the right mouse button) isn't very good as you may try to use it and it doesn't respond right away, or sometimes at all.  It is fun, if you have the patience for a game based on repitition with little depth. I'll suggest a few ideas even though I doubt they will be taken up.  Adding a Campaign Mode would help players understand the backstory and reasons why anyone would strap weapons to a dragon and set it lose.  Adding a system to allow players to spend DNA points on the dragons base abilities such as speed, stamina, health etc would go a long way towards making this a great game.  Setting up the matches to be based on the players level would be a required so nobody can twink the dragon and troll people with lower levels and are just begining ie a level 10 harassing a level 3 just because they can and find it funny. IMO thats why most early players don't return to a game that could be great.",

When you leave the shield up for a while it eventually goes down. When it does you cannot fire leaving you totally open to get shot. Secondly there isnt a very good warning for when you get shot. Sometimes you seem like you get shot from nothing. There is no visual warning and you still take dammage. Finally you should not take dammage from your shortest hair on your left claw getting grazed by a rock. It knocks like 200 hp off and its very annoying.   If you only have a few minutes in a day to play some games and you want a airborne simple shooter game then this is the game for you. Otherwise i would wait for it to get better.

This game is very fun, and very underrated - this seems to be due to some bugs in the past, that seem mostly fixed now. The game is relatively simple, and depends on combat to keep it interesting - perfect for a casual gamer who does not want to wade through huge menus. The dragons have good variability, (I tried two) with a choice of weapons, but not so many that you need a college course to analyse it. The tuitorial is just enough to prepare you. When entering the AI battle, there was a real person instead of AI. He killed me easily about 6 times, chatting, as he did, and encouraging me to chat. He would let me hit him just enough to think I might win, but no... (I am very average). He finally slowed down and let me kill him, and then the game starts giving presents - Ha!...pretty nice. The second AI battle had a bot dragon that was very well programed to hide, dart out, evade, and generally act similar to a real person (challenging). The AI battle landscape is well designed with many places to hide and ambush. Anyway...nothing but fun.",
