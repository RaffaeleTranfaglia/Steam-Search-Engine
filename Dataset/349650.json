Buy this game, but only in a bundle or on sale *and* only if you like kinetic visual novels. It is short, so at full price you might not feel like you're getting full value.",

            "review_text": "It's a visual novel &amp; dating sim parody. They're sometimes so full of themselves, it's refreshing to see their tropes done differently. Have to say I wasn't too convinced by the artwork and gameplay -- couldn't 'undo' actions (how about using RenPy for your next VN?), couldn't save in the middle of a scene, couldn't use a mouse, etc. But it wasn't a deal-breaker. The game has a couple of really funny jokes (and they're not all in the trailer), but it can still be finished in less than an hour if you're trying to fail most of the chapters for laughs (and you'll want to), or 15 minutes with a walkthrough I guess. Other than that, I know the acting sounds cheap but it's deliberate -- some of the voices are from real industry talents such as Amber Lee Connors (HuniePop). Definitely keep an eye on them!",

Now, unlike some other terrible VNs, this one actually IS so bad that it's funny. Not because of the terrible writing and voice acting, that stuff is mostly just boring rather than funny, but because the art is really bad. The artist just doesn't know how to draw faces, and it is hilarious. So if you got it for free or in a bundle, play it once. I mean, it only takes 30 minutes, why not?",
